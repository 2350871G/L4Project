If you want something that is fuss free and saves you a couple of dollars, you might want to try making your own stain remover before purchasing leather cleaning products. Add lemon juice and cream of tartar in a bowl and mix them together until you get a creamy paste consistency. This is a commonly used mixture that typically works to remove stains on leather without any trouble. Some may advise against using natural products because dye stains from jeans are often a lot more challenging to remove. However, it does not hurt to try especially if it does not cause any further damage to your leather."

It has also been found to be helpful for stains that are difficult to remove and therefore a popular product of choice when removing dye stains on leather. Only use saddle soap in small quantities and make sure that it is thoroughly wiped away from the leather once you are done."

Bear in mind that leather cleaner is not a magical product that will instantly remove the stain from your leather. Often you will get the best results by leaving the product in for a while before applying again. Try to use leather cleaner that is recommended by the manufacturer of your leather item. Knowing that the product is trusted by the manufacturers themselves can be reassuring."

If the stain persists, leave the product in for a few minutes to an hour before applying more. Continue repeating this step until you are satisfied with the results.
