          "description":"All of these items are important if you plan on cutting siding. Gloves and goggles are useful for protecting your hands and eyes from damage. The most important piece to remember is the respirator mask, which blocks harmful particles released when cutting siding. You can get all of the items from a home improvement store. Fiber cement is similar to wood siding and is installed the same way. However, the dust released when you cut it is toxic, so always wear your respirator!"

          "headline":"Wedge the siding with shims before removing it.",
          "description":"Start with the lowest panel you want to remove. If you want to replace all of the siding, start at the very bottom. Lift the board up by hand and slide wood shims underneath it. Wedge the panel so it is at least \u20448 in (0.32 cm) away from the wall. Wood shims are small pieces of wood used in carpentry to separate 2 surfaces. You can purchase packs of them at most hardware stores\nIf you only need to replace one piece of siding, pry the piece up just above it and hold it in place with shims. Remove the nails and pull the section of siding out."

          "headline":"Slice the siding into pieces with a circular saw or utility knife.",
          "description":"Set the circular saw to cut about \u204416 in (1.1 cm) deep. This is the average size of wood siding panels, and cutting deeper can mean damaging the layers underneath it. Starting at the bottom of the panel, make vertical cuts up to the panel above it. These small, cut panels are easier to remove and you can easily separate damaged portions this way. You can use the saw or knife this way to cut out broken sections of siding. You can then replace the section without damaging other panels. Another way to do this is to cut horizontally about halfway up from the panel\u2019s bottom end. If you\u2019re replacing one piece of siding, use a reciprocating saw with a short wood blade."

          "description":"Protect the house by holding a \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick piece of plywood against the wall. Rest the pry bar on the plywood as you wedge its blade underneath the siding. Use a hammer or chisel as needed to tap the blade further under the siding. Pull the board toward you to remove it, then cut any remaining nails off with a hacksaw. If the siding feels stuck in place, you may need to deepen the cuts. You can use a utility knife or keyhole saw to do this. If you plan on replacing all of the siding, you don\u2019t have to be as careful. You can damage the other siding panels, but take care not to damage the layers underneath them."

          "headline":"Cut any stuck nails with a hacksaw.",
          "description":"Slide a small, sharp hacksaw underneath the wedged panel. Carefully saw through the nails holding the piece of siding to the wall. The board should be loose now. You can test this by attempting to lift the board away from the wall by hand. To completely loosen a long piece of siding, you will need to move the shims to continue cutting stubborn nails. Alternatively, you could use a reciprocating saw with a long metal blade."

Make sure you wear safety gear, including goggles and a respirator mask. Measure the overlap on any existing siding panels if you can. Try to keep each panel the same size so they all overlap each other evenly."

You will need to secure the panel in place first before hanging any panels above it. Overlap each row of panels by at least 1 in (2.5 cm). Use a level to ensure each panel is straight. Make sure any shims you used earlier are removed from the wall. You want the panels to lay flat against it. If you replace all of the siding, you have a little more leeway. As long as you keep the overlap consistent, your siding should look fine."

You will also want to position each hole at least \u20442 in (1.3 cm) from the board\u2019s bottom edge. Pre-drilling holes prevents damage to the panels and layers underneath them, so taking the time to do it is recommended."

Push the curled end of the blade underneath the free end of the panel. You will feel the curled part hook onto the vinyl lip. You can get a zip tool or siding removal tool for about $5 USD at a hardware store."

Use the zip tool like you did before to remove anything overlapping the panel you wish to remove. For horizontal vinyl panels, you will need to loosen the panel in the row above.

Locate the nails, then use the pry bar to pull them out of the wall. You can also use the claw end of a hammer to pry the nails out. You will need to do this for every panel you wish to remove. Sometimes, the nails will rip through the siding and stay in the wall. Either remove them or pound them flush with a hammer before you install new siding."

The uppermost panel should latch onto the lower panel if the siding is horizontal. If it's vertical, the panel should latch onto the piece next to it. If you are replacing multiple panels, make sure you work row by row. This will be bottom to top for horizontal panels and side to side for vertical panels."

Then, hammer the nails down, leaving about \u204432 in (0.079 cm) of space between the nail head and the vinyl. Vinyl expands and contracts depending on the weather, so keeping it loose prevents it from cracking."

Move the caulk gun at a slow, steady pace so you can fill in the outermost edges of the siding as well as any gaps between panels. Vinyl siding usually does not need to be caulked, but if you notice any gaps, you may want to apply some caulk. Caulk seals the joints, preventing water from getting under the paneling."

The exact size of the brush isn\u2019t important, but bigger brushes will help you coat panels faster. Move the brush in one direction across the panels with even strokes so you can coat the panels in a smooth layer of primer. You can paint any type of siding, including vinyl.

You will get a more even paint coating if you wait. Check the primer\u2019s label for the manufacturer\u2019s recommended drying time.
