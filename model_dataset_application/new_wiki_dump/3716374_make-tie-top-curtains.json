  "text":" Taking Measurements Measure the window. This will provide you with the measurements needed for the fabric amounts. You will need three panels for each curtain (2 curtains in total), each panel measuring one third of the entire length. Add 8cm/3 inches to the top of the top panel. This provides the heading. Add 16cm/6.5 inches to the bottom panel for the curtain's hem. In terms of width, both curtains together must cover width of the curtain pole plus 12cm/5 inches for side hems.  If using lining, make it 4cm/1 3/4 inches smaller than the finished curtain.  Preparing the Fabric Cut out the fabric according to the measurements taken above.  Put the top panel down on a flat surface. Add the middle panel on top of it. Face the right sides together, aligning the raw edges. Pin the two panels together, then stitch the panels together at one edge, allowing a 1/5cm / 5/8 inch seam allowance. If the fabric has patterns, stripes or checks, match as best you can before sewing. Press open the seam. Attach the bottom panel to the middle panel in the same manner.  Seams and Hems Cut two lengths of braid or ribbon. Cut to the width of the panels. Pin over the seams that join the curtain panels. Stitch in place, sewing both edges of the braid. This will cover the seams and make the curtain appear more streamlined. Press in a hem at each side of the curtain. Press in a 6cm/ 2.5 inch hem. For the base, press in an 8cm/ 3 inch hem. Press in the angled miters. Pin and sew the hems in place. Adding Lining (Optional) If adding lining, cut out according to the above measurements. Press in a 2cm/ 3/4 inch around the side edge and a 2cm/ 3/4 inch base hem. Pin and miter the corners, then stitch all in place. Put the curtain on a flat surface, right side facing down. Place the lining onto the back of the curtain, matching up the corners with the curtain's corners. Pin in place and slip stitch onto the curtain fabric. However, do not stitch the base edge, as this helps the curtain to hang better. Adding Ties to the Curtain Tops Make the ties. The ties should be placed one every 25cm/10 inches across the top of the curtain, so measure to determine how many you'll need. To make a tie:\nCut a strip of fabric measuring 6 x 50cm/ 2.5 x 20 inches for each tie. Knot the ends of each strip. Turn the curtain over to face right side up on the flat surface. Mark a line 8cm/3 inches below the top raw edge across the top of the curtain. Use an invisible marker that fades or tailor's chalk. Begin at the top corner of the curtain, then measure 25cm/10 inches across for each tie. Pin each tie halfway sitting on the line you just drew. Stitch all the way along the row, capturing each tie halfway on the line (this is easiest done with machine stitching). Finishing Up Press in a double 4cm/1 3/4 inch fold to the wrong side of the top edge of the curtains. Pin and slip stitch the fold in place. At each of the top corners of the curtain, close the open ends. Stitch using slip stitch to close. Press the completed curtains.  Done. The tie top curtains are ready to tie onto the curtain pole using the top ties. Simply tie into bows around the curtain rod all the way along the length of the rod. Leave enough room to push the curtains back and forth with ease. Finished. ",
