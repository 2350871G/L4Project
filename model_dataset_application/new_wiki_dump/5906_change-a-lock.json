Draw a tape measure from the latch edge of the door to the center of the doorknob or deadbolt lockset. Most contemporary locksets are either 2-3/8 inch (6cm) or 2-3/4 inch (6.5cm) diameter. The bolt or latch in many new locksets are adjustable for both, but make sure before leaving your hardware store to keep from having to backtrack. Older locksets may vary in size, but are generally smaller, requiring more extensive carpentry (and greater woodworking skills). If that's what you have, try checking vintage renovation stores for a \"new\" lockset."

Removing and replacing screws tends to weaken their hold in the door. If you can't get the new screws to bite, you may have to shove a small splinter of wood (or two) into the screw hole and snap them off flush with the edge of the door (toothpicks work well for this). Another alternative is to purchase longer screws, but make sure that the screw heads are identical to the ones provided by the manufacturer or they may not seat properly and cause problems."
