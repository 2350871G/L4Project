          "description":"Heat up 1-5 uncovered pancakes at a time on a microwave-safe plate. Experiment with timing to see what works best with your microwave\u2019s wattage; you may find that 5 pancakes will be ready to go after just about a minute, or that they\u2019ll need a bit more time. If you froze your pancake, let it defrost in the refrigerator overnight before microwaving in the morning. This is the fastest method, and great for a busy weekday morning. Your pancakes should be soft, fluffy, warm, and ready to eat! If you find your pancakes getting a bit mushy in the microwave, try microwaving them for a shorter time. Mix it up to see what length of time works best for your pancakes and your microwave."

          "description":"Set the toaster to a medium setting and check it when it pops out. Cut into your pancake a bit to see if it\u2019s heated all the way through. If it\u2019s just slightly crispy and warm or hot, serve it up and enjoy! If it\u2019s still lukewarm or cold, let it toast for a few minutes more. Toast pancakes that use a non-white flour, like whole wheat flour. They\u2019ll get just slightly crunchy on the outside without becoming doughy underneath. You can use a toaster oven or a regular toaster. This method is typically limited to smaller batches because of the small size of toasters and toaster ovens."

          "description":"Wrap your pancakes in foil before putting them in, which will help them retain their fluffiness and not get too dry. You can either wrap up a stack in foil, or lay them flat on a baking sheet and cover it tightly with foil. Check the pancakes after 10 minutes to see if they\u2019re ready - they\u2019ll be warm and soft, but not too hot or crunchy. Put them back in for a few minutes if they\u2019re still a little cold. This is a great option if you\u2019re reheating a large number of pancakes. Simply wrap up as many as you need and pop them in the oven!"
