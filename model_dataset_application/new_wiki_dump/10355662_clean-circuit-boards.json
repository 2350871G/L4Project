Spraying compressed air into your computer while it\u2019s still running can potentially damage the components and risk your own electrocution.

Spray compressed air in short bursts onto the board, keeping the canister upright and the nozzle a few inches away from the circuit board. This will also give you an opportunity to look for grime and corrosion that may require more extensive cleaning. Grime and corrosion that is especially large or is building up near a heat generator or on top of circuit pathways should be removed."
