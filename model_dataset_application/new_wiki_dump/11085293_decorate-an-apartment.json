          "description":"Select frames that harmonize with the color of your walls and the overall feel you\u2019re trying to create for the room. A customized art piece or family photographs hung in your living room can add a dash of personality to the space. Look for a frame that matches both the art and other key decorating pieces in the room."

          "description":"If you want to make your room seem larger and make it brighter during the day, position the mirror on the wall opposite to your window. Hang it so that your eyes are at the same height as the mirror\u2019s middle. Choose a distressed wood frame for your mirror if you\u2019re going for a rustic look in your room. A simple, black frame, on the other hand, will complement a sleek and modern decorating scheme."

          "headline":"Bring color and texture to a room by hanging a tapestry.",
          "description":"You can hang a tapestry over the sofa in your living room, above your bed\u2019s headboard, or on any other section of a wall that you think could benefit from a dash of color or the addition different texture. To hang a weaving or vintage fabric, you can use pushpins or small nails or hook-and-loop fasteners. Alternatively, you could stretch it over a frame you\u2019ve hung on your wall. Self-adhesive hook-and-loop fasteners work especially well on curved walls and have the added benefit of not leaving behind any holes in the wall. If you want to hang a heavier tapestry, you may want to consider draping it over a rod."

          "headline":"Choose curtains that complement your room\u2019s style.",
          "description":"Choose curtains that match the color of your sofa and/or walls for a seamless look. Go with solid-colored curtains if you want to enhance the color scheme of your room, or patterned curtains if you want to draw visitors\u2019 eyes toward the room\u2019s window. You can make your windows seem taller if you install your curtain rods high above the top of the window frame and wider if you extend rod beyond the window\u2019s frame. If you want to make your ceilings seem higher than they are, go with curtains with vertical stripes. If you anticipate that you\u2019ll be moving in the near future, don\u2019t spend too much money on your curtains, since they may not fit the windows in your future apartment."

Choose a light color if you want to make a small room feel roomier or a darker color if you want to give the room a more intimate feel. Before painting the walls of a rental apartment, check with your landlord to make sure that it\u2019s okay to do so."

You can use potted plants as centerpieces on a coffee or dining table, place a small tree in the corner of a room, or mount a hanging plant on a wall. If you don\u2019t want the hassle of watering indoor plants, artificial plants are a great alternative. If a lack of floor space is an issue, you can place smaller plants on tables and other surfaces or use hanging plants."

When looking for throw pillows, find colors, textures, patterns, and sizes that either harmonize well with the room\u2019s aesthetic or strike an intriguing contrast. If the walls and furniture in a room are white or a light beige, brightly-colored throw pillows with bold patterns can add a burst of energy. Selecting throw pillows of the same color but with different textures or patterns is another way to liven up a space."

You can find rugs of a variety of sizes, patterns, textures, and colors at furniture stores. To find cheaper rugs, check out a local thrift store."

The light they provide can draw the eye to certain design elements, while lampshades, lamp bases, and sconces can serve as attractive decorative accents. Lamp bases that are metallic, or are made of another reflective material, can make your room brighter by reflecting light."

Buying pieces of furniture with storage spaces can help keep your living space from becoming cluttered, which will help maintain the original look of your decorated room. A coffee table with shelves underneath can provide you with a convenient place to keep books, magazines, and other odds and ends. If you need a place to store extra blankets and throw pillows, consider getting an ottoman with a hollow inside and detachable top. A bed with drawers below the mattress can be a great space-saving alternative to a bulky dresser."

Select couches and chairs with narrower widths, and light and airy tables and coffee tables, instead of heavy and bulky ones. A see-through acrylic coffee table can serve the same function as a solid-wood one, while appearing to take up less room. If you\u2019re decorating a small space, floating shelves are a great, functional alternative to bulkier pieces of furniture, such as chests and bookcases."

If you buy a small bench, for example, you can use it as a seat when you have guests over, or a small table where you can stack books. Getting a sofa that folds into a futon will give your guests a place to sleep when they visit. Furniture with wheels will give you the freedom to easily rearrange your d\u00e9cor for different occasions."

This technique is especially helpful when decorating a studio apartment or an apartment with a wide-open floor plan. By placing a sofa in the middle of a studio apartment, for example, you can create a distinct living room and a bedroom."
