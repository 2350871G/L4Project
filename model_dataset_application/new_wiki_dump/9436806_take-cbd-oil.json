Squeeze the drops under your tongue and hold the tincture in place for 30 seconds before swallowing. If your tincture comes in a spray bottle, spritz it once on the inside of each cheek. A tincture can start working in as little as 15 minutes, but you\u2019ll likely start feeling the effects in about 30 minutes.

          "description":"CBD topical oils typically contain both CBD oil and a carrier, such as coconut oil or beeswax. A massage oil is great for treating achy muscles and joints, as well as chronic pain. Put the massage oil on your fingers, then use your fingers to massage the oil directly onto the area you want to treat. Make circular motions on your skin as you apply the oil. You may notice less pain immediately, but it\u2019s more common to get relief in 30 minutes to a few hours. However, keep in mind that some people don\u2019t get relief from CBD oil. If you don\u2019t like the first oil you try, consider using a different product. You might buy a massage oil that has a higher concentration of CBD oil or a different carrier. For instance, CBD oil diluted with coconut oil might work better for you than CBD oil mixed with beeswax.Tip: You might be able to treat acne by dabbing topical CBD oil onto your pimples."

While these products are usually fun and easy to use, they may not work as well as other CBD products because they go through your digestive system. You'll likely feel more relaxed in about 2-4 hours, but it\u2019s possible edibles won\u2019t work for you. It typically takes about 2-4 hours for your body to digest enough of the product for the CBD oil to enter your bloodstream.
