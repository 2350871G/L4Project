You may be able to do it without the aid of a knife on the thinner ones and if you have sharp or strong finger nails. Preheat a chip pan (one with a basket is useful here) as you would when cooking potato chips,  then add the chestnuts.  While you wait for the chestnuts to cook,  prepare an empty work surface by covering it with an opened out broadsheet newspaper. Also get a few sheets of kitchen roll ready. As with deep frying chips,  you will see that the chestnuts are ready when they start to float.  Lift the basket out of the pan,  hold it over the newspaper and shake off as much of the loose oil as possible now.  Hold the pan lid over the basket,  and shake it vigorously over the newspaper.
