To keep the caramels from sticking to the dish, line it with parchment paper so the excess hangs over the edge. Next, spray the sides of the dish and the paper with nonstick cooking spray. If you don\u2019t have parchment paper, you can line your baking dish with foil instead. You can substitute butter for the cooking spray, but be careful not to apply too much."

Stir the mixture gently to moisten the sugar and form a thick paste. Wipe down the sides of the pan to ensure that there are no sugar crystals above the surface of the sugar mixture before heating it. You can use a damp paper towel or pastry brush to wipe away the sugar. Don\u2019t try to combine your ingredients in a small sauce pan.

At 320 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius), the syrup will darken, taking on a golden color. You may also notice that it starts to smell like caramel.
