          "description":"Good chocolate will have cocoa solids (the actual chocolate) and cocoa butter (the creaminess of the chocolate) as top ingredients. High-quality dark chocolate consists simply of cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and possibly vanilla, lecithin (an ingredient that keeps the chocolate from separating), and sugar. If you browse the list of ingredients and see many ingredients you do not recognize, consider purchasing a different chocolate. Milk or milk solids may be an ingredient in milk and white chocolates. Avoid chocolates that have sugar as the top ingredient or include additional fats or Dutch cocoa."

Dark chocolate should be eaten within 1 year after purchasing, and both milk and white chocolate should be eaten within 6 months after purchasing. The production date is a bigger factor for retail chocolates that are expected to have a longer shelf life than handmade or specialty chocolates."

If you're buying a well-made bar of dark chocolate, for example, you will likely pay three or four times what you would for a mass-produced milk chocolate bar. A high price doesn't guarantee high-quality chocolate, though. Some sellers may try to sell commercial grade chocolates at a higher price. Price inflation can be especially prevalent if the chocolates are \u201cpretty,\u201d such as bonbons or truffles."

Baking chocolate is typically sold in bars and will have a very high cocoa percentage, often over 70% cacao. Follow your recipe's directions, and buy a variety of baking chocolate that corresponds with the suggested cacao percentage. Baking chocolates will be located in the baking section of any grocery store. If you'd like to find an organic or all-natural brand, check the organic section, or visit a health-food grocery store. Depending on the recipe you're following, you can also bake with semi-sweet chocolate chips, wafers, or cocoa powder."

Chocolate that smells of anything else means it has not been stored well. Chocolate absorbs the odor and flavor of its environment, so pay attention to whatever is on display nearby. In some high-end chocolate establishments, the owner may allow you to open a bar or package of chocolate that you'd like to buy so that you can evaluate the chocolate.

The chocolate should also break clean and in a straight line. If the chocolate bends or falls apart when you break it, the quality is inferior. Milk or white chocolates will also often bend, rather than snap, when pressure is exerted."

Beyond taste, high quality chocolates will begin to melt in your mouth immediately. The texture should be creamy and smooth. Personal preference also comes into play at this point. The quality here can only be decided by tasting the chocolate to see if it is of the variety you are looking for. Some people like a very dark, bitter chocolate (over 80% cacao), while others like a milder dark chocolate. Chocolate that is inferior will taste a little off or feel grainy in your mouth."
