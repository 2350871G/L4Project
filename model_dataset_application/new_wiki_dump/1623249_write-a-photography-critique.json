Then, use the body to expand upon your thoughts and offer more specific advice. Close with a final paragraph, where you can give a summary of your thoughts. Write your introduction after you've written the body so you know what to summarize."

Writing about elements you thought worked can help the photographer improve, too. Writing your positive thoughts first can make the photographer more open to negative opinions."
