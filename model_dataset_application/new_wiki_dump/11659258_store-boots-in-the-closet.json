Pay special attention to the bottom of your boots as well to ensure you don't track dirt through your closet. Dampen the cloth to remove extra dirt, if desired.

Stuffing tall boots is a great way to make them last longer and stay upright even when you\u2019re not wearing them. If you\u2019re stuffing the boots with paper, scrunch up the paper and put enough in each boot so that the boot stands upright easily. Roll up magazines or cut pool noodles into pieces to use these to stuff boots as well. Boot shapers are shoe trees for boots that can be purchased and stuck into boots to keep them rigid."

Place these in your boots if you won't be wearing them for several months or if you're putting the boots in a storage container.

Putting boots up on a tall shelf is another great way to store them easily, lining them up beside each other with the toes facing you. Place a doormat inside your closet to go under your boots. If you\u2019re installing shelves in the closet, make sure the shelves are tall enough that your tall boots can fit easily."

          "description":"Purchase boot boxes that are long enough to store your specific pair of boots. Place each boot on its side in the box so they're resting horizontally before securely closing the lid. Since the boxes are long and flat, you'll be able to easily store more boot boxes on top of one another. Label each box so you know which boots are inside. To ensure your boots keep their shape, stuff each boot with newspaper or another material before placing them in the box. Boot boxes are most often made of plastic for extra protection and can be found at your local home goods store or online. Choose a clear boot box so you can easily see which boots are inside."

Place each boot over the dowel so the boot is upside down and supported by the peg, preventing dirt from getting all over the closet. Store the peg or coat rack under your shorter pieces of clothing so your boots don't get your clothes dirty. If you\u2019re creating your own peg rack, customize each peg to ensure it\u2019s long or short enough to hold each specific pair of boots that you have. Attach the peg rack to a wall in the closet."

Set each pair of boots upright in the crate, storing 2 pairs in each crate if you'd like. Clear a section of the wall in your closet so you can stack as many crates as needed."
