Also, try to remember that oven-baked foods will cook more quickly and evenly if you can avoid opening the oven door repeatedly to check on the food. Try to pull everything you need from the refrigerator in one go. Use an oven timer for help with preheating, checking on your food, and remembering to turn the oven off."

Frozen foods also help to keep the interior of your fridge nice and chilly as the cold seeps into the surrounding air. Thawing foods like meat or casseroles all the way will reduce their cooking time once you're ready to start."

Soups, pasta dishes, and rice-based dishes are great examples of recipes that can be made using only one pot. This may require cooking in stages, i.e., browning the meat, boiling the pasta, and then finally combining all ingredients in the pot to finish the cooking together."

Leaving your soup to boil increases the possibility of scorching food at the bottom of the pot, so lowering the heat can have more than one benefit."

Contact the store where you purchased your appliances. They may have a repairman available to help you. Note the brand and model number of your appliance before calling the repairman. This information can be found in the manual that came with the appliance, or on the appliance itself. If you can't find this information, tell the repairman that you don't know.
