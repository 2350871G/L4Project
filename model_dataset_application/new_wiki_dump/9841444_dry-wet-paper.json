If you have a larger number of wet papers, try freezing them instead. Air drying is generally more labor-intensive than freezing your papers. Do not air dry glossy papers.

Bound papers or documents with multiple papers should be placed together but apart from separate papers. Choose a room with good air circulation and low humidity levels to help the papers dry faster."

If your document has multiple papers, insert tissue or a paper towel every 10 pages. Do not separate severely wet sheets if your document has multiple papers. Wait until they dry enough to be damp, but not soaked. Change the tissues or paper towels regularly until the papers become damp."

If your document is bound or has multiple pages, sandwich each page with a tissue or paper towel. A large book that you don't need to keep in mint condition or a paperweight could both work as sturdy objects."
