Don't remove the fat; during the cooking process, it melts with the meat and causes it to be deliciously tender. If you'd prefer to cook the pork shoulder whole, that's fine too.

Add a liberal amount of salt and pepper and toss to coat. You can get creative with the spices in this recipe. If you like your meat extra spicy, add 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Don't skimp with the salt; you can add up to 2 teaspoons."

If you'd prefer to cook the carnitas in a slow cooker, transfer the meat and vegetables to a slow cooker and cook on high for 4 hours, or on low for 8 hours. If the carnitas look like they could use some moisture during the course of cooking, add 1/2 cup of water. Don't remove the carnitas until they are completely tender; cooking the carnitas for a shorter period of time will leave you with tough meat."
