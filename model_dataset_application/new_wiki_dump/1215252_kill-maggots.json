          "description":"Permethrin is a synthetic chemical that is used as an insecticide, insect repellent, or acaricide. Permethrin sprays are typically designed to kill scabies and lice, but 2 to 3 sprays is enough to kill maggots. Liquid (shampoo) and cream products also contain permethrin. Mix 4 parts boiling water with 1 part permethrin dog shampoo and slowly dump the mixture over any maggots. Apply your spray or permethrin mixture in a 5 to 25 foot (1.5 to 7.6 m) radius from the source of the maggots. This will ensure that you reach the entire affected area and prevent the maggots from returning. While permethrin is safe for use in human hair and on the scalp, take care not to get it in your eyes, ears, nose, or mouth. If you do, flush or clean it away immediately. Permethrin and synthetic pyrethroids can be fatal to cats and fish\u2014keep them away from pets!"
