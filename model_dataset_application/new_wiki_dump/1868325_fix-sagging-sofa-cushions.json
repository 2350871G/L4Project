          "description":"You should use either quilt batting or polyester fiberfill. Both polyester fiberfill and quilt batting can be purchased at a craft store or at a large store that sells home goods, like Walmart. Insert more foam, spreading it around to make it smooth and even. You can put it around the current couch cushion but inside the pillowcase. If it is badly worn, you may need to replace the foam. If your cushions are filled with loose stuffing, stuff them with polyester fiberfill. You do not need to take any of the current stuffing out of the pillows. Use your hand to distribute it evenly. If they are more like pillows, you can wrap them with quilt batting. Take the pillow out of the pillowcase and wrap it in the quilt batting. You can use an adhesive spray (purchased at a craft store) to secure the quilt batting to the current pillow. If you have just a cushion inside the pillowcase, you can still add loose stuffing. Spread the polyester fiberfill evenly around the pillow to make sure that the pillow is not lumpy. When you stuff the cushions, use your hand to spread the stuffing evenly around.
