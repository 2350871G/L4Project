          "headline":"Peel the lemon.",
          "description":"Lemon zest is great as an addition to many dishes, but you don\u2019t want to eat the entire lemon rind raw. To start, take a sharp knife and cut off the top and tail of the lemon. Stand the lemon up on one of those cut sides. With your knife, peel off strips from the lemon until all the skin has been removed. When you're peeling, try to remove as much of the white pith as possible, as this is very bitter. Once you\u2019ve peeled the lemon, go around and remove any leftover pith by peeling it away with your fingers or cutting it off. When possible, eat only Meyer lemons raw. They are sweeter and less acidic than other lemon varieties, and are much more pleasant to eat like this."

          "headline":"Cut wedges from the lemon.",
          "description":"Insert the tip of your knife in between two wedges of the lemon, cutting to the inside of the membrane that encases the wedge. Cut the full length of the wedge, then move to the other side to separate the second side from the lemon. Remove the wedge of lemon and place it into a bowl. Always cut to the inside of the membrane, so that the lemon wedge doesn\u2019t have the membrane attached. This part of the lemon is sour and bitter. Repeat until you have removed all the individual wedges from the lemon."

        {
          "headline":"Serve and enjoy.",
          "description":"You can sprinkle the lemon with some sugar if you want to take away some of the sourness and add some sweetness. Sprinkle one to two teaspoons (5 to 10 g) of sugar over the lemon bites and stir to coat them. You can either eat the lemons plain, with sugar, or you can add them to a salad, a fruit cocktail, or another dish."

          "description":"Simple syrup is made by dissolving sugar in equal amounts of water. It\u2019s ideal for cold recipes because the sugar stays liquid after it dissolves. To make it, combine the sugar and 1 cup (237 ml) of the water in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat and bring the mixture to a low simmer. Once the sugar is fully dissolved, remove the pan from the heat and set it aside to cool. Simple syrup will keep in the fridge for several weeks. To make extra for later, add double the water and sugar and divide when cool."

          "headline":"Get your lemon juice.",
          "description":"While the simple syrup is cooling, squeeze the juice from between five and eight lemons, until you have a full cup (237 ml) of juice. You can either peel the lemons and run them through a juicer, or cut them in half and use a manual juicer to push out the juice. You can also substitute in lime juice for any or all of the lemon juice if you want to make limeade or lemon-limeade instead. You can use bottled lemon juice if you don\u2019t want to go through the trouble of squeezing your own, but the results won\u2019t be quite the same because bottled lemon juice doesn\u2019t taste the same as fresh lemon juice."

You can also garnish it with:\nSprigs of fresh herbs and flowers, such as thyme, basil, rosemary, and lavender\nFresh lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit slices\nPineapple wedges"

Refrigerate any leftovers for up to a few days. To turn the lemonade into a lemon soda, mix equal parts lemonade and sparkling water and serve with an extra shot of lemon juice."
