          "description":"Gin & Tonic is one of the most popular drinks of all time, thanks to its wonderfully simple, yet refreshing quality. To make the perfect Gin & Tonic you will need: a large highball glass, plenty of well-frozen, clear ice cubes, a lime, a chilled bottle of tonic water and the best quality gin you can get your hands on. To prepare:\nRoll the lime on the counter beneath your palm to release the juice, then use a sharp knife to cut it across the center. Turn one lime half onto its flat side and cut it into four equal quarters. Take one lime wedge and squeeze its juice into the highball glass, then drop the wedge into the glass. Grab your bottle of gin and pour a double measure (1.5 oz.) into the glass. If you don't have a measuring cup, you can use the cap of the gin bottle. Three cap-fulls plus an extra dash is about right. Fill your glass with as many ice cubes as you can fit, then use a long spoon to stir the drink for a couple of seconds. Open the bottle of chilled tonic and pour 3.5 oz. into the glass. Stir the drink again to combine the gin, tonic and lime juice. If needed, add more ice to bring the level of the liquid about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) away from the rim of the glass - don't add any more tonic water. Take another lime wedge and slot it onto the rim of the glass to garnish. Add a clear straw, if desired."

          "description":"Rum & Coke is another classic drink whose flavor can vary depending on the type of rum you use - you can go for regular dark rum, spiced rum, coconut rum, whatever you feel like! The traditional Rum & Coke uses light rum, and when garnished with a lime wedge becomes a drink known as a Cuba Libre. To prepare a perfect rum and coke:\nFill a highball glass with well-frozen, clear ice. Measure out 2 oz. of your chosen rum and pour it over the ice. Measure 4 oz. of Coke (or another cola brand) and pour it into the glass, stirring with a long spoon as you pour. Garnish the glass with a lime wedge for a Cuba Libre, or with a maraschino cherry if using spiced or coconut rum."

Though many people prepare Vodka & Cranberry juice just using those two ingredients, the traditional recipe also calls for a dash of Rose's lime juice and a dash of orange juice, to really enhance the flavor of the cranberry. To prepare:\nHalf-fill an old-fashioned glass with clear, well-frozen ice. Measure out 1 oz. (or 2 oz. if you want a stronger drink) of vodka and pour it over the ice. Add 4\u00bd oz. of cranberry juice and, if using, a dash of Rose's lime juice and a dash of good-quality orange juice. Serve with one or two straws and garnish with a wedge of lime."

It's most commonly made with Jameson Irish whiskey, but also works well with bourbon and rye whiskeys. To prepare:\nFill a highball glass with clear, well-frozen ice. Measure out 1.5 oz. of your chosen whiskey and pour over the ice. Open a fresh, chilled can of ginger ale and pour into the glass, until the level of the liquid is about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) away from the rim. Squeeze the juice from a lime wedge into the drink, then drop the lime wedge in. Use a long spoon to stir the drink, and serve."

Nevertheless, a good gin can make an excellent drink served chilled over ice on a hot summer day. Simply fill a highball glass with ice cubes, pour over a measure of your finest gin (Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray are two good options), and add a twist of fresh lime juice, if you like."

          "description":"How you drink whiskey will really depend on the alcohol volume and personal preference. Any whiskeys with an ABV (alcohol by volume) over 50% can usually benefit from a splash of water or a couple of ice cubes to dilute the alcohol slightly, thus allowing you to pick up on the flavors more easily. Whiskeys with ABVs between 45% and 50% can either be diluted with a little water or ice, or left on their own - it's really a matter of which taste your prefer. Whiskeys with ABVs less than 40% should technically be drunk neat (no water or ice, unchilled) as they have already been cut down to this volume in the distillery and don't require any further dilution."

You should also place your serving glasses (2 or 3 oz. glasses are best) in the freezer for about an hour to get them nice and cold. Once they're ready, pour a shot measure (1.5 oz.) of the frozen vodka into the chilled glasses. Do not add ice. Warm the glass in your hand for a minute or two before drinking, to bring the vodka to ideal drinking temperature."

Like whiskey, rum can be served by itself, with a splash of water (5 to 6 drops), or over ice--it really depends on your personal preference. The best glass to use for rum is a snifter--the opening of the glass is rather small, allowing the rum's vapors and aromas to become concentrated."

          "description":"While most lower-range tequilas are served in a shot glass, good quality tequilas should be served in a snifter or a similar glass that has a small mouth. When serving tequila straight, it is important to 'warm up' your mouth. If you were to take a large gulp of tequila, it would taste fiery and some of the liquor's flavor would be wasted. Instead, warm up your mouth by taking a tiny sip of the tequila and letting the liquid run over all of the surfaces of your mouth--gums, tongue, and cheeks included. After this warm up you'll be able to taste and fully appreciate the subtle flavors of the tequila."

Gin can be a difficult drink to drink straight, unless it is of a very good quality. Nevertheless, a good gin can make an excellent drink served chilled over ice on a hot summer day. Simply fill a highball glass with ice cubes, pour over a measure of your finest gin (Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray are two good options), and add a twist of fresh lime juice, if you like.

Any whiskeys with an ABV (alcohol by volume) over 50% can usually benefit from a splash of water or a couple of ice cubes to dilute the alcohol slightly, thus allowing you to pick up on the flavors more easily. Whiskeys with ABVs between 45% and 50% can either be diluted with a little water or ice, or left on their own - it's really a matter of which taste your prefer.

Garnishes are fun--no one can deny that. Match your garnish with the flavor or personality of your drink. Go wild--everyone will be jealous of your mini-umbrella, pineapple chunk, and maraschino cherry. Create a base for a homemade cocktail. If you are making up your own recipe, you should start with a solid base. Mocktails that are too sweet can be a little overwhelming so a good base for pretty much any mocktail is one ounce of lemon or lime juice mixed with \u00be ounce of  fresh simple syrup. From there you can  muddle away to your heart\u2019s content, or add some club soda to get your sparkle on. Try out some non-alcoholic versions of classic cocktails. If you\u2019re not in a very creative mood and would rather stick to a cocktail you know, minus the alcohol, there are plenty of recipes out there for that. In particular, cocktails made with vodka can very easily be turned into mocktails--vodka is a neutral flavor so its absence won\u2019t really change the cocktail too much. Try out some of these classic mocktail recipes:\n\n Make a Safe Sex on the Beach mocktail. All the risque of the original drink, without the risk. Try a Mojito Mocktail. Mint, limes, club soda...what\u2019s not to love? Make a strawberry margarita, minus the tequila. Get your groove on but not your booze on. Make a non alcoholic pina colada. Nothing says poolside quite like a pina colada--now your kids can enjoy these booze-less versions while you enjoy your own drink.",
