Once a lemon is ripe, however, it can stay on the tree for several weeks. Lemon trees need to mature before they can bear ripe fruit. Some lemon trees may bear fruit sooner, but the fruit won't be ripe. In general, lemon trees produce ripe fruit after they are three years old. If your tree is bearing fruit, but they never ripen, check the tree's age. Expect lemons to be ripe between late November and mid-January. Try to harvest your crop before mid-January, or you will risk hampering the following year's harvest."

If you are growing your tree indoors, consider keeping next to a window, ideally a south-facing one. Lemon trees need six to eight hours of sunlight each day. Lemon trees also need warmth, and grow best when temperatures average at 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) during the day and 55\u00b0F (13\u00b0C) at night. Keep in mind that they will usually go into dormancy when temperatures fall below 55 F. (13 C.)"

Avoid over-watering the tree, and do not let it sit in water. This could encourage rot, mold, and disease. For the same reasons, do not mulch lemon (or any citrus) trees. Mulch will only hold moisture against the roots, increasing the probability of root rot. Most home citrus gardeners also keep the area under the drip line of the tree free of weeds and grass to promote better evaporation of any standing water."

Lemon trees use up a lot of energy to grow and to produce leaves, flowers, and fruit. An under-nourished lemon tree won't have the energy to produce healthy fruit, which could prevent the tree from ripening. Lemon trees need a lot of nitrogen to grow. The fertilizer should contain more nitrogen than phosphorus or potassium."
