If you prefer heavily seasoned fish, use 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt and 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of pepper. You can use tilefish, cod, halibut, or blackfish that's around 1 in (2.5 cm) thick. If you have thinner fillets, they'll cook a few minutes faster. Check the fish for pin bones and use tweezers to pull them out."
