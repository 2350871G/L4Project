There should be a clear delineation between the two liqueurs. If you are having a hard time getting the liqueurs to stack, try tipping the shot glass to the side and gently tipping the Irish cream over the side of the shot glass. This will help regulate the stream of liqueur and prevent them from combining. Although Irish cream is the most common ingredient, there are variations. Instead of using Irish cream, some people prefer Amaretto almond liqueur or banana and orange liqueur. If you make this variation, use a 1 ounce of Amaretto or 1/2 an ounce of each of banana liqueur and orange liqueur."

If it is someone's first time taking a Blow Job shot, bartenders will often put a stemless maraschino cherry on top."
