You are spreading out the light, either by diffusion or reflection, to be larger. You are taking a smaller, brighter light source and making it appear to wrap itself around the subject. Decide if you want to diffusion or reflection.  Reflection Have something that will reflect the light with you. This could be:\nA white, or light colored wall, ceiling, or building\nA white board\nA White sheet\nCurtain, etc Position your subject 'between' the light and the reflector. Move them around in relation to each other to get the look that you want. Direct your light at the reflector. That would be your flash, a continuous light, or the sun. Reposition your subject and reflector as needed, until you have achieved the look that you want.  Take your shot.  Diffusion If you have opted for diffusion, be sure that the diffusion material is proportional in its size in relation to the light and its location.
