Never take plants that grow near areas where pesticides are used heavily (for example, farms), urban areas, polluted water sources, or closer than 150 feet (45.7 m) from roads. These plants may have absorbed toxins from their environment that could make you sick. It's best to forage in wilderness areas, such as forests and meadows untouched by human advancement. In cities where green spaces are encouraged however, the milkweed may be perfectly fine to consume; you know your own locale, so trust that knowledge."

Two common lookalikes are dogbane and butterlfy-weed, both of which are toxic. If the shoots you believe to be milkweed have stems covered with fuzz and ooze white sap when broken, it is not dogbane or butterfly-weed. If you can't positively identify the shoots as milkweed, wait until they're fully grown and take notes of the areas where milkweed can be found. Try again next spring."
