Every few hours, record where the sun is shining on your map. Keep in mind that the site's exposure to sunlight will also vary at different times of the year. A perennial plant used to the equatorial tropics is not a great choice for an area with cold, dark winters. One way to mark this on your map is to draw dotted lines around the area receiving sun, and label the area inside them with the time of day. At the end of the day, write in approximately how many hours of sunlight each area received, based on the dotted lines. Note any shaded areas that may happen as the sun moves throughout the day, such as areas under and around trees, awnings, buildings etc."

Each plant has a preferred range of pH levels, soil types, and nutrient levels which may be included on the label or available through an online search. If you want to increase the nutrients or water retention in your soil, mix in 1\u20132 inches of compost or other rotted organic matter six inches deep. If a soil analysis is not feasible, consider using plants native to your area only, which often do not require soil adjustments."

Search online for your region's annual rainfall as well. Focus on plants with a hardiness rating and preferred rainfall levels suitable for your area, so your garden will thrive without expending extra effort and resources. If annual rainfall is concentrated in a short \"monsoon\" period, you may need plants that can withstand a wide range of water levels, or plant annual plants that thrive either in the monsoon season or the dry season."

As described in more detail below, your xeriscaped garden will be planted in \"layers\" surrounding each focal point or \"oasis\" with high visibility and good water retention, such a tree or house. The basic plan involves:\nOases with bright, eye-catching species that are well-suited to local conditions. A transition area around each oasis, with plants with lower water requirements. Arid zones with low water retention or low visibility, where more drought-tolerant, low-maintenance plants are kept."

Since some plants can take more sun and heat than others, plant the more sun-friendly, drought-tolerant plants where most of the afternoon sun will be located. Depending on water levels in the area, you may want to plan out additional water retention steps:\nConsider growing plants within containers to maximize water retention, especially if there is not much water runoff in your garden.

The lowest maintenance plants will go here. These are often native plants and/or drought-resistant plants that require little watering, if any. There are several approaches here, and you may decide to use both in your yard:\nYou may plant larger arid zone plants include cacti, succulents, and drought-resistant shrubs. This is most common in desert areas, where water is so scarce that the oases may not add enough color or variety by themselves. You may plant low lawn substitutes instead to cover a large area with a low-water \"carpet\" of plants. This can include native prairie, a clover lawn, or clumps of ornamental grass surrounded by mulch. For expansive arid areas, you might make an exception and plant a taller or brighter focal point, such as a raised flowerbed or tree.
