If you don't have syrup you can replace it with another sweetener such as agave nectar or sugar. Honey is not a vegan sweetener, so if you want to make it vegan, avoid using honey. It is important that you use plain pumpkin pur\u00e9e and not pumpkin pie blend or canned pur\u00e9e which has extra ingredients."
