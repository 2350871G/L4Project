      "description":"In Wild World, he sells the regular fishing rod for 500 bells. In City Folk, Tom sells both the fishing rod and the silver rod, both for 500 bells each, however, the silver rod is pretty rare. In New Horizons, you can purchase a fishing rod from Timmy for 400 Bells at Resident Services. If you wait until Day 2 in New Horizons, you can take Tom Nook's DIY course. He will give you the recipe to craft a flimsy fishing rod out of 5 tree branches at the crafting table in Resident Services. Purchase the Pretty Good Tools recipe from Tom Nooks shop to learn how to make a better fishing rod. In order to receive the golden fishing rod, a player must catch all of the fish in their designated game. The amount of fish are 40 in Animal Crossing, 56 in Wild World, 64 in City Folk, 72 in New Leaf, and 80 in New Horizons. In New Leaf and New Horizon, the fishing rod is sold at Timmy and Tommy's shop. You can get a silver or gold fishing rod at the Museum Shop after the Museum expansion."

To use bait, get the DIY recipe for fish bait. Then dig up a manilla clam on the shores using a shovel. Craft fish bait using the crafting table in Resident Service.
