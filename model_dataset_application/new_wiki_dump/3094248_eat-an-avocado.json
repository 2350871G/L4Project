          "description":"The perfect avocado will yield slightly to light pressure and should feel similar to the skin between your thumb and forefinger when it\u2019s outstretched. If it feels hard to the touch (like a rock rather than a fruit), it\u2019s definitely not ripe yet and, although it\u2019s still safe to eat, won\u2019t have the same taste or consistency of a ripe avocado. If, on the other hand, it\u2019s super mushy, then the avocado is likely overripe and won\u2019t taste very good. Another way to determine the ripeness of an avocado is to pull back the stem. If the skin under the stem looks healthy and green, the avocado is ready to eat. If the stem doesn\u2019t come off easily, it\u2019s probably not ripe yet and if the flesh under the stem is brown, the avocado is likely overripe. Ripe avocados generally have dark green or nearly black skin that will be a bit bumpy. If your avocado isn't quite ripe yet, try sealing it in a paper bag with a banana, apple, or other fruit in order to ripen it more quickly."

          "headline":"Cut the avocado in half lengthwise.",
          "description":"Hold the avocado steady on a cutting board using your non-dominant hand. Take a sharp chef\u2019s knife in your other hand and use it to slice the avocado lengthwise (from the stem towards the larger bottom of the fruit). Once you feel the knife hit the pit, keep the knife steady and rotate the avocado until you\u2019ve cut around the entire circumference of the fruit. If the avocado doesn\u2019t break into two pieces on its own after it\u2019s cut, use your hands to twist the two halves of the avocado in opposite directions until they pull apart."

          "headline":"Remove the pit by whacking into it with your knife.",
          "description":"Hold the half of the avocado with the pit cut-side-out on the cutting board. Then aim your knife at the pit and use a short, controlled swinging motion to whack into it. Be sure to use enough force to drive your knife into the pit without slipping off it\u2019s smooth exterior. Pull the pit out by twisting the knife. Use a large chef's knife instead of a small paring knife. The latter will not have enough power to stick into the pit. Discard the pit after you remove it. While there is some ongoing research into the safety of eating avocado pits, it\u2019s generally not recommended."

Be careful not to pierce the skin of the avocado as you cut. Then use a large spoon to scoop the squared pieces out. Diced avocado can be used to top salads, eggs, nachos, and other dishes."

You can mash the flesh with a fork or place it flat-side down on a cutting board and cut it into neat slices using the tip of your knife. The flesh of very ripe avocados may not come out of their skin as neatly and may require a few scoops. If you want neat-looking slices, try using a slightly underripe fruit."

Simply remove the avocado flesh from the skin and use a fork to mash it into a smooth consistency. For a bit of added flavor, add salt, pepper, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes. For a twist on traditional ranch, mash 2 avocados with 1 packet of ranch dressing mix, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of fresh lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of mayonnaise.

Bake them in a 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) oven for about 15 minutes or until the edges start to turn a little golden. Remove from the oven and eat warm on top of a grain-based salad.

Then remove the avocados from the grill and let them cool before using a spoon to remove the skins and cutting then into slices. Fold the charred slices into tortillas and top with a tomato or fruit salsa, fresh sprigs of cilantro, and crumbled queso fresco. No grill?

If the hole left by the pit is smaller than your egg, use a spoon to scoop a bit of extra flesh out from each avocado half. Then place the avocado halves into a baking dish and crack an egg into each hole. Bake for 12 minutes or until the whites of the eggs have fully set. If you have trouble getting the avocado halves to balance in the baking dish, try building small \u201cnests\u201d for them out of tin foil.

Toss the sauce with warm, freshly cooked pasta and top with parmesan cheese, roasted cherry tomatoes, or chopped basil. Opt for pasta with plenty of body\u2014such as spaghetti, soba noodles, fusilli or farfalle\u2014to hold up to the thick, creamy avocado sauce. For a low-carb or gluten-free option, try zucchini noodles. Leftover pasta and avocado sauce can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 3 days, although the color may darken a bit as the avocado oxidizes."
