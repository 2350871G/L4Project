That way, you can catch flies from all directions. Door openings, awnings, sheds, and tree branches are all viable locations. Also find a surface that a thumbtack can penetrate, like wood or drywall.

Hanging the Trap Hold the red loop up against the surface of where you are hanging the trap. When you find a spot for the ribbon, hold it up against an attachment point.
