          "description":"It\u2019s easy enough for someone to say that you should get multiple estimates for any home improvement project, but a lot of people don\u2019t realize how long it can take a contractor to get to a job site to work up an estimate. It\u2019s a good rule of thumb to begin soliciting estimates at least thirty days before you plan on signing a contract. A lot of contractors are small operations with only a few employees. What\u2019s more, home improvement contractors often cover a large geographic area since it\u2019s difficult to predict when and where a potential job will come from. They\u2019re busy people who do a lot of driving, so it may take a week or two for them to get to you. After the initial visit, it will probably take another week to get an estimate."

          "description":"The internet age has made it possible for nearly anyone to work up a preliminary estimate all by themselves with just a few hours and the willingness to do some research. There are many cost-estimation sites online, including Homewyze, HomeAdvisor, and This Old House. Some, like Homewyze, are more detailed than others. Depending on your online estimator\u2019s level of detail, you might need to measure square footage and make some preliminary decisions on materials\u2014like wood, vinyl, or laminate flooring\u2014to get an accurate estimate."

Angie\u2019s List is one of the best review aggregators, and all of the ratings on Angie\u2019s List are legitimate. But even Angie\u2019s List allows highly rated contractors to pay to have their names come up first in the search results. The same problem pops up with word of mouth referrals. For example, say you want to build a stone wall in your front yard. Your sister had a stone wall built a year ago, and it looks great, and she highly recommends the stonemason. The problem is, structures are about more than looks\u2014they also have to be built soundly. How does your sister know she didn\u2019t pay for a beautiful wall that\u2019s going to fall over in three years? The contractor\u2019s experience is probably the best way to ease some of these anxieties. If they\u2019ve been working in your area for three decades, they come recommended, and they\u2019ve got good online reviews, then they\u2019re probably worth taking a look at. Check with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) online to see their score, any previous complaints, and customer comments. Although most people won\u2019t do it, it\u2019s not a bad idea to conduct a personal background check on your contractor. If your contractor has defrauded people before, there\u2019s a good chance it was in another state\u2014because they won\u2019t be licensed in a state where they have committed fraud. A thorough background check can help to ferret out any troubling criminal history."

For example, if you\u2019re getting a ceiling fan installed, that\u2019s a small job. You pick the fan, which accounts for the cost of materials, so the only variable is labor. If your entire house is getting renovated and the contractor tells you the kitchen will cost $7,000, let that serve as a warning sign. Unless you\u2019ve already picked out the appliances, the countertops, fixtures, flooring and more, there\u2019s simply no way to know how much it will cost.

If you only got three estimates, and one of them is much higher than the others, don\u2019t you want to know why? The high contractor might have spotted a problem the other two missed.

If you find yourself in that kind of dilemma, the best option may be to get another estimate from a fourth contractor. Ask for an explanation when costs vary significantly.
