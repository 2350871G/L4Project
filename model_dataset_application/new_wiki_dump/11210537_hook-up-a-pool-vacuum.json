          "description":"Most filtration systems have a switch or dial on them with multiple settings based on whether you\u2019re swimming, cleaning, vacuuming, or changing the water. Turn your switch or dial to the \u201cvacuum,\u201d \u201cpump to waste,\u201d or \u201ccleaning\u201d setting to prepare the filter for vacuuming. On some pools, the label will read \u201cvacuum.\u201d On others, it will say \u201cclean,\u201d or \u201cpump to waste.\u201d These terms are often used interchangeably, but can sometimes mean different things. Always consult the manual for your filter before turning the dial or switch.Tip: If your pool has a backwash setting, run it for 10-15 minutes before changing the filter setting to \u201cvacuum\u201d or \u201ccleaning.\u201d This will reverse the flow of water temporarily and allow all of the debris that has washed into your filter to be pushed back into the pool."

Empty them out by prying each skimmer lid off and emptying the basket. If there are weirs, or gates, on your skimmers, slide or fold the gates closed. Leave the skimmer weir closest to your pump open. Most skimmers have weirs that automatically close when the pump shuts off so that debris doesn\u2019t float back into the pool. If you don\u2019t know where your skimmers are, look for small, circular covers 1\u20132 feet (0.30\u20130.61 m) from the edge of your pool.

If your pool came with plugs for the skimmer baskets, put them in every skimmer except the one closest to your pump. If your skimmers have weirs, your pool may not have come with rubber plugs.

The most common connection locations are the open skimmer, suction port, or filter. An automatic pool vacuum system uses the pool\u2019s natural filtration system to clean it, so it could hook up to several ports since the entire pool uses the filtration system. Tip: If you\u2019ve purchased a vacuum with a hose that doesn\u2019t fit your skimmer, suction port, or filter, you will need to purchase an adapter. Some vacuum systems come with an adapter to fit it over a skimmer. To hook up your hose to the open skimmer, take the end of your hose and attach it to the adapter with the unthreaded side on the end. Stick the adapter inside the skimmer by fitting it into the opening under the lid. To hook up your hose to the suction port, inspect your filter for a handle on top of the valve where your filter pipe and water line meet. Twist the valve to open it and screw your hose into the threading. To fit your hose into the filter, inspect your sand filter and look for a cap that is labeled \u201creturn.\u201d Unscrew this cap and screw your hose into it by using the threading on the hose or an adapter for the filter."
