Get out a notebook and a pencil and write down the entire recipe several times to memorize it quickly. Try doing this once a day until you've committed the information to memory. Be thorough as you're writing the recipe, jotting down the instructions that go along with the ingredients and measurements. Some researchers say that if you repeat something 30 times while focusing hard on it, you\u2019ll have it memorized. After you write the recipe out at least 5 times, try to test yourself and see if you can write it purely from memory."

Sing the list of ingredients to the tune of a song you already know or make up your own tune that goes with the recipe.

For example, if you\u2019re trying to remember the ingredients in a pesto chicken bake dish, you might create the phrase \u201cPlease Take My Chick!\u201d which stands for the ingredients pesto, tomato, mozzarella cheese, and chicken. Another example might be remembering the word \u201cMESH\u201d which stand for milk foam, espresso, steamed milk, and hot chocolate if you're trying to make a mocha latte. Mnemonic devices work for memorizing measurements that go along with ingredients too."

Think of an image that will remind you of an ingredient or measurement the next time you have to remember your recipe. For example, if you\u2019re making a mojito, you might picture each ingredient in your head, such as the mint leaves, rum, and club soda. Picture anything that creates a connection to the recipe; this could be a memory you have of a friend making the recipe, a character from a book who ate or drank what you're making, or any other image that comes to mind."

This helps you memorize the recipe using the visual layout of the place you know well. The memory palace technique is great for linking specific measurements or amounts with ingredients, such as thinking of 1 cup (240 ml) of milk when you picture your living room."
