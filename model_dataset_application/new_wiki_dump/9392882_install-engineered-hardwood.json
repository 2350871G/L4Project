Once you\u2019re done sanding, sawing, and filling in the floor, sweep or vacuum up the debris. The subfloor should be totally clean.

Run the felt in the same direction that your flooring will be going. You probably won't be able to use one piece of felt to cover the whole floor. In that case, set the felt so that the edges touch. Use a hammer tacker to staple down the felt edges every 4 feet (1.2 m) and within \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of the wall. When you\u2019re finished laying the felt, hammer down on staples that aren\u2019t flush with the floor. Place spacers against the wall. The spacers should be \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick. Lay them against the wall where you\u2019re laying your first row of flooring and the adjacent wall, about 4 inches (10 cm) apart. This keeps your flooring spaced and prevents buckling. Spacers are usually included in your flooring, but if they aren't, you can purchase them at most home improvement stores. Start the first row in the corner of the longest exterior wall in the room. Lay your first piece of flooring so that the grooved edge of the wood is against the spacers. Then butt up the next piece of flooring next to the original piece, making a long strip along the wall with the spacers. Use a mallet to tap the end of each strip so they fit snugly together. Place a straightedge against the tongues of the first row. The front edge of each piece of flooring should have a tongue\u2014a little piece that sticks out. Use a straight edge to line up against the tongues and pull the flooring forward so every piece is flush against the straightedge. Nail each board within 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the wall. Once you\u2019ve got the first row laid down, nail the board down within 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the wall. This secures the first row of flooring and prevents any movement as you stack more rows. Nail the boards with 1.5 in (3.8 cm) nails every 8 inches (20 cm). Toenail the first row. You can use a regular hammer and nails, but a pneumatic nail gun is quicker and easier.

Repeat this every 4 inches (10 cm) and no closer than 2 inches (5.1 cm) to the edge nearest the adjacent wall. Lay down the second row of flooring. As you lay the second row of flooring, make sure you\u2019re choosing lengths that don\u2019t line up exactly with the first row. Otherwise your edges will all line up and ruin the look of the flooring. Instead, offset the end joints by 12 inches (30 cm) or so. Tap each row snugly against the one before it.

You\u2019ll need to take the tongue off the last row of flooring\u2014you can use a table saw to do so, or a hand saw if you don\u2019t have a table saw. Fasten the trim in place with a brad nailer. These pieces of trim will cover the space between the edge of the flooring and the wall. Lay them in place and then use a pull bar to pull them close to the last row of flooring. Once they're flush against the first row of flooring, nail them down. Installing Floating Engineered Hardwood Floors Install underlayment if you don\u2019t already have it. When installing floating engineered hardwood on a concrete floor, it\u2019s best to do so on top of an underlayment. This will prevent the flooring from moving and also eliminate a crunching sound as you walk on the floor.Underlayment is a hard, thin, hard layer of foam, wood, or cement board. You can even use plywood, which can be nailed into place along the edges. Set up spacers along the walls. Most manufacturers require a certain amount of space between the edge of the flooring and the wall. This space varies by manufacturer, but is usually around \u20442 inch (1.3 cm). Your hardwood might come with spacers, or you can purchase your own from most home improvement stores. Apply glue to the groove of the board. Each board will have a groove on one edge and a tongue on the other. When placed together, this allows the hardwood to snap together with no space between boards. Apply wood groove adhesive to the groove in each piece of wood. Lay it on the floor and then insert the tongue of the next board. Use a tapper block and hammer to ensure a snug fit. As you lay down each board and insert the tongue of one board into the groove of the next, set a tapping block on the end. Use a hammer or mallet to gently tap the tapping block to ensure each board is snug against the previous one. Wipe up any excess glue as you go. Once you tap the flooring together to ensure a snug fit, some glue might squeeze up between the boards. Immediately wipe this excess glue away with a damp rag. Otherwise it will be almost impossible to get off. Use painters tape to secure each row. Every 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) on each row, connect one row to the row after it with painters\u2019 tape. This keeps the rows secure and prevents them from moving. Use a flat bar to pull the last row of flooring against the one before it. You won\u2019t have room to get a tapping block and hammer between the last row of flooring at the wall. Instead, place the tapping block against the last row of flooring and then use a flat bar to pull it snug. Install the trim. Apply glue to the edge of the trim that will butt up against the last row of flooring. Carefully lay the trim on the subfloor, then press it against the edge of the last row of flooring. Let the floor dry for 24 hours. Once 24 hours have passed you can remove the painters\u2019 tape and walk on the floor. You can also replace any furniture in the room. Gluing Down Engineered Hardwoods on Concrete Subfloors Add underlayment if recommended by the manufacturer. Some engineered hardwood manufacturers recommend installing underlayment between the flooring and a concrete subfloor. Underlayment prevents the flooring from moving and makes the floor quieter to walk on.You can use foam, wood, cement board, or another hard, thin layer for the underlayment. Plywood is a popular choice, as it can be nailed into place along the edges. Lay out your spacers against the wall. Each manufacturer will have different spacing requirements, so make sure you check the directions. If your hardwood didn\u2019t come with spacers, you can get some of your own from most home improvement stores. Pour glue onto the concrete. You should pour enough glue that it\u2019s about the width of 2 or 3 boards. Then use the trowel to scrape the side of the bucket and prevent drips. Use the trowel to spread the glue. You should hold the trowel at a 45-degree angle to the floor. Make sure the teeth of the trowel are touching the concrete, and spread the glue. You should only spread the glue far enough to work with 2 or 3 rows of flooring. Otherwise it will dry too quickly. You can use less glue than this to start if you\u2019re nervous about timing. Spread enough for two rows until you get the hang of it and can work more quickly. Lay the first row of boards. They should be flush against the spacers, with the tongue facing out into the room. As you lay each new board down, make sure its edge is flush against the edge of the piece before it. Fit the groove of the second row over the tongue of the first. This secures each row and makes sure there\u2019s no space between them. As you set each new board, use a tapping block and mallet to secure it in place. The edges of the new boards should be staggered about 6 inches (15 cm) from each end. If you\u2019re gluing the boards down, use a tapping block that lays on top of the board and has a curved edge the hangs down over the edge of the flooring. Otherwise your block will get stuck in the glue. Let the flooring dry for 24 hours. Once you\u2019ve finished gluing down your flooring, let it dry for 24 hours. If you haven\u2019t finished the flooring but need to stop for a while, give it 24 hours before you step on it again. Install the trim. Once your flooring is in, remove the spacers and slide the trim pieces between the flooring and the wall. If necessary, use a flat bar to pull the trim taught against the first row of flooring.",
