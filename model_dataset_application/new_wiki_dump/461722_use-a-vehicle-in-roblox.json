  "text":" Driving Ordinary Vehicles Locate a vehicle.  Find it's driver seat. Usually, the driver's seat is colored different from the rest of the seats. Equip the car or plane tool.

Select a plane tool (most airplanes has a built-in tool).  Press E key to start an engine. Press Y if you are playing in a Ro-Force Rescue Mission or basic-block-made planes.
