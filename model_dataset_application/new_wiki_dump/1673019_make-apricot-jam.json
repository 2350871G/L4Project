Fill it with enough water so that it will cover the filled jam jars with an extra one to two inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water. Put on the lid, turn the heat on high, and bring the water to a boil. Once the jam is ready and has been put into jars, you will have to boil the filled jars in a water bath to sterilize everything and kill bacteria. This will help to preserve the jam longer."

Rinse the jars, lids, and rings and set them on a clean drying rack. Preheat your oven to 150 F (65 C). Place the jars in the roasting pan and into the oven. It\u2019s not necessary to sterilize your jars before canning, but they should be warm to prevent them from cracking when the hot jam is introduced. Leave the jars in the oven until you're ready to pour the jam. Be sure to use new lids every time you can food. The lids are only designed to be used once, and may not seal properly if they're reused."

To pit and dice the fruit:\nCut the apricots in half, being careful of the pit in the center. Pull the halves apart and remove the pit. Cut the apricots into half-inch (1.25 cm) cubes. Apricots have a very thin skin, so they don\u2019t have to be peeled for jam."

The acidity in the lemon juice will help kill bacteria, keeping the jam from spoiling and free of mold. For a jam with some added spice, add 1 tablespoon (a \u00bc inch cube) of freshly grated ginger to the pot as well. To make a jam with less added sugar, you can use as few as 4 cups (900 g) of sugar with this recipe."

The heat will also help the acidity in the lemon juice to draw pectin from the fruit, which gives the jam it\u2019s gel-like consistency. Stir the mixture occasionally so that the fruit doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pot."

After the mixture boils, stir it frequently to prevent the jam from burning. When the jam gets to 220 F (104 C), turn off the heat and remove the pot. At this temperature, the water from the fruit has boiled off and the jam will become thick."
