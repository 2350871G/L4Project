  "text":" Make Sweater Mittens Choose your sweater from old worn-out clothing in your closet or buy 1 from a thrift store. Keep the style of the person that you are giving the mittens to in mind. Almost any sized sweater, from small to large, will work for this project. Trace a mitten pattern by putting your hand on a piece of paper. Run a pencil around the edge of your thumb, fingers and wrist, leaving extra room for someone with bigger hands. Add 1/2-inch (1.3 cm) to the edge of the sweater pattern for your seams, or up to 1 inch (2.54 cm) for a bulky sweater. Pin the pattern to the sweater, making sure you pin both layers. Cut through both layers of fabric, front and back, to form the 2 sides of your first mitten. Make sure to leave enough space in the body of the sweater to make the second mitten. Place the outsides of the mitten facing in while you sew them together. You will turn them inside out later on. Pin the 2 mittens together. Place the mittens on your sewing machine and take out matching thread. Start at the bottom cuff and sew around the edges, leaving 1/4-inch (0.6 cm) of a seam allowance. Sew the outside again, leaving a 1/8-inch (0.3 cm) seam allowance. This will prevent fraying. Make sure not to sew the bottom of the cuff. Turn the mitten right side out through the bottom of the cuff. Repeat the same procedure to complete the second mitten. Make a Felted Sweater Scarf Choose 3 100 percent wool sweaters for this craft. Choose large sweaters for this craft because you are going to need to shrink them before you begin sewing. Pre-shrink your wool sweaters by washing them. Place them in the wash on the hottest setting. Then, place them in the dryer on the hottest setting. Cut the front and back of your sweaters apart and remove the arms. You will be able to use both sides. The sweaters will also be flatter and easier to cut in this fashion. Use a rotary cutter and a self-healing mat, if you have 1. It will be easier to measure exactly with these tools and a plastic measuring board that is 6 inches (15.2 cm) wide. Make 11 6 by 8-inch (15.2 by 20.3 cm) blocks out of your 3 sweaters. Place a sweater on the self-healing mat and put the 6 inch (15.2 cm) measuring board above it. Use a rotary cutter or sharp fabric scissors to cut along the edge. Cut 1 long strip that is 6 inches (15.2 cm) wide, and then cut the length every 8 inches (20.3 cm). Repeat this with your 3 different sweaters, until you have 11 blocks. You will sew along the 6-inch (15.2 cm) width. Lay your blocks out in an attractive pattern that your friend or family member will like. Pick contrasting or complimentary thread on your sewing machine and set it to the zig-zag stitch. Line up 2 blocks next to each other and stitch them down the center, so the zig-zag grasps both sides. Repeat with the next block until you have sewn all 11 blocks together. Embellish the sweater scarf with buttons, yarn or ribbon. Make a Sweater Pet Bed Choose 4 or 5 sweaters that contain at least 50 percent animal fibers, such as wool, angora, alpaca or cashmere. Put the sweaters in the washing machine at a high temperature, with soap. Dry them on high heat, and you have your felted sweaters. Cut the arms from the sweaters and the front portions apart from the back portions. This will give you large pieces of raw material from which to choose your design. Find an old pillow that fits the size of the cat, dog or other pet in question. For example, you may want to use part of a body pillow or a floor pillow for a large pet. You can probably use a normal head pillow for a cat or small dog. Place a large sheet of paper over 1 side of the pillow. You may need to tape a few pieces of paper together to get the entire measurement of the pillow. Cut the paper to the exact size of 1 half of the pillow, fitting it to the curves of the sides. Cut an assortment of even blocks out of your sweater with your self-healing mat, rotary cutter and plastic ruler. For an interesting look, experiment with making your squares different sizes and shapes - small, thin, thick, rectangular and square. Lay the shapes on top of the paper in a pattern you like. Cut out any excess material that goes over the paper piece. Pin your pieces of cloth together a few at a time. Place the side you want to show in toward the center and pin, so that you are stitching on the side that will not show. You will want to leave approximately a 1/8-inch (0.3 cm) seam on each piece. Start sewing. You will need to go back to your pattern and continue pinning and sewing new rows, until your patchwork pet bed is completely sewn together. You may want to do it 1 square at a time, to ensure you follow your pattern. Place the paper on top of your finished top and cut any edges that have extended past the paper's lines.  Return to your sweater collection and repeat a similar process for the underside of the pet bed. You may want to do stripes or do a simple 1 or 2 color combination across the back, because it will show less than the front side. Place the outside surfaces against each other and line them up. Pin through both layers at about 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the edges. Sew up your rectangle at 1/4-inch (0.6 cm) from the edges, back stitching at the corners. Leave 1 end open and turn the fabric around, so the right side is showing. Slip the pillow into the patchwork case. Take a needle and thread and stitch up the last side. You can also affix a zipper to either edge of the last open side for easy washing.",
