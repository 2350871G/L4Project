          "description":"The vibe in the living room will be very different from the vibe in the bedroom. Think about how the room is used--is it a place to relax, a place to gather with friends, a place to work, a place to sleep--and how you want to feel when you are in the room. The function of the room is just as important as the overall look. The main function of your bedroom is as a place to unwind and sleep, so while you may be loving those loud prints, they might be better suited to a room with more action. Make a list of words that describe how you want to feel in the room: productive, quiet, social, inspired. Keep these words in mind when you're decorating and ask yourself if the furniture, colors, and accents you are choosing support the mood you want. Do a little research on color theory to help emphasize mood. Bright colors encourage social behavior, so they work well in a living room. A room that is all one color isn't as exciting, but works well where you want a calm vibe, like a bedroom."

You can see if a queen-size bed overwhelms your small bedroom, or if your desk looks better at the foot of the bed or against the opposite wall. Take your measurements whenever you go furniture shopping, so you don't accidentally end up with furniture that won't fit in your room. Consider the spaces just outside your room as well: you might not be able to get that huge sofa through the door if there are lots of tight corners leading to your room. Measure doorways and elevators, and find out if you can take larger furniture apart. Even unscrewing the legs off a couch may help. Mark the location of your outlets so you can plan where your lighting, television, computer, and other electronics can plug in."

Rely on natural light from windows, table and floor lamps, and try to avoid harsh overhead lighting. Dorm rooms and rentals often have a single overhead light fixed to the ceiling. If you can, swap it out for something more attractive, like an inexpensive chandelier from Ikea (remember to save the original lighting to replace when you move), or soften the light by hanging scarf or covering it with a lampshade. Remember the lighting will affect how the colors appear in your room. That beautiful shade of green you painted your walls may look like swamp water in bad lighting.

A balanced room means that you don't have all your heavy furniture on one side, or all your exciting fabrics and artwork clustered together across from an empty wall. It can take a while to get it right, but try moving things around so that the things that dominate the room are equally spread out. Try walking through the room to make sure there aren't any obstacles and you can move freely into the next room, or to the table, couch, or bed. If you are using prints, try mixing to bring balance to the room. If you use striped wallpaper, try adding in less structured, more organic details, like a pillow with a floral pattern."
