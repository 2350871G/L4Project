Deciphering the Document Transcribe the document. Review each word and letter of the document and write down the words, letters, and abbreviations that you recognize on a separate piece of paper. Leave a blank space for the words you don\u2019t recognize. Read the document aloud. Hearing the text may help you to recognize unfamiliar words and can help place antiquated words in a modern context. Transcribe abbreviations. Writing down an abbreviations key on a separate piece of paper is a great way to keep track of the abbreviations used in the document. It is also handy to refer back to while studying the document.
