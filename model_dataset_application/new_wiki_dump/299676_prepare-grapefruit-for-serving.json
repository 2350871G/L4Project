If you are unsure where the top and bottom of the grapefruit are, find the two dots, or navels, on the grapefruit at opposite ends. These are the top and bottom of the grapefruit. Think of these dots as the \u201cpoles\u201d of the grapefruit, like the poles of the earth.

This is fairly work-intensive, and you will probably lose a little bit of the fruit as you are cutting out the membrane.

Instead of cutting the grapefruit around the center, cut the grapefruit top to bottom at each navel, or pole. This should give you two equal sized grapefruit halves. Cut away the outside skin. Lay each grapefruit half flat side down on a cutting board. Take a sharp knife and cut away the skin. You can also try peeling the skin with your fingernails, but a knife may work better to also get off the white layer of membrane inside the skin. Cut away the fruit from the membrane.

Stand one grapefruit half up on a cutting board so that the \u201cpole\u201d of the grapefruit and the open part of the grapefruit are horizontal to the cutting board.

Cut the slices into wedges. Take the sharp knife and cut each circular grapefruit slice into a half-moon shaped slice. You can stop here, or if you want smaller wedges, cut the half-moon shaped slices in half to create triangular slices. Cut a small slit in the slices and put them on glass rims. Take the knife and cut a small slit into the fruit of each grapefruit wedge. Take the wedges and put them on the rims of glasses or cups; the slit will help the grapefruit stay put on the rim. If you are not preparing any beverages, you can also simply put grapefruit cut in this way on a plate to eat. Making Grapefruit Juice Cut the grapefruit in half. Half the grapefruit at its center through the \u201cequator\u201d. This should give you two equal grapefruit halves. Use a manual citric juicer to juice the grapefruit halves. Put the manual juicer on top of a glass with the pointed side up. Take a grapefruit half and start to rub it into the pointed end of the juicer. You should see juice being released. Keep turning the grapefruit around in circular motions as you gently press it against the juicer. You may need to use multiple grapefruits to get the amount of juice you want. Strain the grapefruit juice. After you have released all the juice from both grapefruit halves, take a strainer and pour the grapefruit juice into another glass. This should remove any seeds or large pieces of pulp from the juice. Drink the grapefruit juice straight from the glass. Broiling Grapefruit Prepare the broiler and the grapefruit. Set the broiler to its highest heat and preheat. Meanwhile, cut the grapefruit in half along its \u201cequator\u201d line. Cut the grapefruit around the rim of the fruit and along the segment lines. Take a sharp knife and cut some of the skin off the rounded bottom part of each grapefruit half so it can stand without tilting. Drizzle the grapefruit with cherry juice and sprinkle with brown sugar. While the broiler is still preheating, pour a couple of teaspoons of maraschino cherry juice into the grapefruit halves. Then sprinkle each grapefruit half with as much brown sugar as desired. You can also add half a teaspoon of butter if you want a richer flavor. Cook in the boiler for 8-10 minutes. After the broiler is done preheating, place the grapefruit halves into a shallow pan and cook. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or a little longer if you want a softer and more golden-brown grapefruit.
