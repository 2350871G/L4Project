          "description":"A tincture is a type of compound that can be absorbed orally. Hemp oil in this form is increasingly available for purchase from numerous outlets. Look for a bottle at a local pharmacy, vitamin store, or on the internet. Hemp oil comes in different flavors, because its natural flavor is sometimes too earthy for people, so consider buying a flavored variety if that's an important consideration for you. When considering a hemp product, always investigate the manufacturer before making a purchase. Start with an internet search to see if there are any complaints or violations listed against a manufacturer. Then, contact manufacturers and ask for their full supplement facts, ingredients, and how they produce their hemp oil. Reputable companies should be transparent about their practices and shouldn't delay in providing you this information. Be skeptical of manufacturers that make wild health claims. For example, a few doses of hemp oil will not cure cancer. Manufacturers that make such claims are exaggerating and you shouldn't trust them."

The most common instructions are to use 1 or 2 drops once or twice per day. Start with a low dose when you are just starting with hemp oil. This helps avoid adverse reactions and lets your body get used to it. One drop is a good starting point. Clinical trials have shown that 1500 mg of hemp daily is safe, so keep that in mind and do not exceed this amount.
