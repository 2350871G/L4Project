Locating A Water Leak Check the toilet in each bathroom. Running or leaking toilets are one of the most common source of water leaks in a home.

Troubleshooting Hot Water Low Pressure Inspect the water heater if your low water pressure only affects your hot water. In this case the water heater shut off valve is the most common source of this problem. Verify the shut-off valve is completely open. For safety, each water heater includes a shut-off valve to use in case of emergencies. If the valve is shut even slightly, this can affect your water pressure. Test your water faucets again to see if the problem is resolved. The water pressure issue should be resolved when hot water is run through a faucet.
