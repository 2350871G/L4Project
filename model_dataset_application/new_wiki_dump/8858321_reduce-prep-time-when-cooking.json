          "description":"To save time on busy weeknights, designate a block of time Sunday night to chop, slice, and dice fruits and veggies for the rest of the week\u2019s meals. You can place chopped fruits or veggies in a plastic bag or storage container with a damp paper towel and store them in the fridge. Place chopped onions and other go-to ingredients in a freezer bag and freeze them for up to three weeks. Store potatoes, apples, and other items that turn brown in the fridge in a bowl of ice water with a squeeze of lemon juice."

          "headline":"Combine seasonings ahead of time.",
          "description":"Try to plan your meals for the week ahead and think of which spices you\u2019ll need for them. Premeasure them in the morning or over the weekend and store them in small storage containers or plastic bags. Pre-measured seasonings will save you time when you actually cook your meal, ensure you use the right amount, and guarantee you won\u2019t forget a spice."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Prepare meat in bulk.",
          "description":"Instead of cooking meat for just one meal, prepare a larger quantity that you can either freeze or refrigerate for a quick meal later in the week. Reuse your leftovers creatively so you won\u2019t get bored eating the same thing. For example, shred your roasted chicken leftovers to make quesadillas or chicken salad."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cook lots of pasta in the morning.",
          "description":"Try boiling a large pot of pasta in the morning while you pack lunches, make coffee, eat breakfast, and complete other tasks. Boil it until it\u2019s al dente, drain the water, then cover it and refrigerate it until dinner. Multitasking in the morning will save you a solid 15 minutes at dinnertime. Set a timer if you\u2019re worried that you might forget about the boiling pasta."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Parboil vegetables in the morning.",
          "description":"Boil your veggies until they\u2019re not quite tender, transfer them to a bowl of ice water, drain them, then refrigerate them until dinnertime. This will cut prep time at dinner hour and, since you\u2019ll only have to warm the veggies, reduce overall cooking time. For example, parboil veggies like broccoli, carrots, and asparagus in the morning, then add them to a stir-fry, a pasta dish, or just serve them as side dishes. Shocking them in ice water will also preserve their color and up your presentation game."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Learn to love roasted veggies.",
          "description":"Compared to stir-frying or sauteing, roasting is a relatively hands-off cooking method that requires minimal prep. Instead of spending lots of time finely mincing, slicing, or dicing, you\u2019ll only need to give your veggies a rough chop. Simply drizzle them with olive oil and seasonings, then pop them in the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) for 30 to 45 minutes. Aside from turning them once while they roast, you\u2019ll be free to get ready in the morning or finish up that bit of paperwork you took home from the office."

          "description":"A sharp, good quality knife is the biggest kitchen time saver. Invest in a well-balanced chef\u2019s knife and knife sharpener. Work on your knife skills to prep food more efficiently, and remember to curl your guiding hand\u2019s fingers inward to avoid cutting yourself. For some cutting tasks, like trimming and deboning, it\u2019s quicker and easier to use a good set of kitchen shears instead of a knife. Choose a sturdy pair that can come apart for easy cleaning.

When shopping for an egg slicer, choose an all-metal model. The better the quality, the better it\u2019ll handle items other than hard-boiled eggs."

          "description":"Peeling is one of the most time consuming and tedious prep jobs, so a sharp, durable vegetable peeler is a key time-saving kitchen tool. Using a high-quality peeler instead a dull one or paring knife will allow you to quickly and evenly prep carrots, apples, and other fruits and veggies. Using tricks of the trade can also help you reduce your peeling time. To peel a head of garlic, smash it with the heel of your hand to loosen the cloves, then shake the cloves between two bowls. If you microwave a head of garlic for 20 seconds, the cloves will slip right out of the skin. To peel potatoes easily, score them (just slicing the skin) around the middle, boil them for 15 minutes, drain the water, rinse them with cold water so they\u2019re cool enough to touch, then gently peel off the skins."

Since they\u2019re dishwasher safe, they\u2019ll also reduce your clean up time. Use multiple cutting boards to avoid cross-contamination and cut out the time it would take to wash one board between uses."

In addition to reducing prep time, blenders and immersion blenders are essential for tasks like pureeing. Try making a quick soup or sauce by pureeing leftover veggies, like spinach and other leafy greens. You can also slash your cutting time by using a mandoline to uniformly shave, slice, or julienne ingredients."
