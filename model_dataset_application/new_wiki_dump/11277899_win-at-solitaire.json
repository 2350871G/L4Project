          "description":"If you\u2019re playing timed solitaire, you win by quickly stacking cards into sequential piles and tallying up the score once you concede or finish piling the cards out. If you are playing standard or Vegas solitaire, you can only win by putting every card into the 4 piles on the top right based on the suit and order. Keep in mind that you will not be able to win every game\u2014there could be a combination of cards that are buried and keep you from moving cards into the piles at the top. The difference between standard and Vegas solitaire is that standard solitaire only reveals 1 card from the deck at a time. In Vegas solitaire, you reveal 3 cards every time. You can only make piles of cards on the board by using alternating colors. So 2 red cards can\u2019t be stacked on top of one another. You can only put Kings on to a slot on the board if the column is empty."

          "description":"The face-down deck in the upper left is called the stock and the cards that you flip over to the right to play from are called the waste pile. When the game starts, immediately flip your first card (or first 3 cards) over. The extra information will help you navigate your opening couple of turns. For example, if you have a black 6 as the only card in the first pile and red seven in a different column, you\u2019d normally wait until you have a king to fill the blank spot in. If there\u2019s a king in the first waste pile though, you know that you can move that card immediately. Another scenario where the first card in the waste pile is important is if there is an ace. That would allow you to immediately play a 2 from the board, which may give you access to a playable downcard."

          "headline":"Put any Aces and 2s into the foundation piles before playing anything else.",
          "description":"Before you start moving cards or flipping through the stock, look at every available card on the tableau to see if there are any aces you can move into the 4 scoring piles in the upper right, which are called foundations. Move all available aces into the foundations and check for any matching 2s. If you have any, go ahead and score them since they can only hinder your progress if they aren\u2019t in the foundation. The tableau refers to the 7 columns of available cards on the board that you can play. The upside-down cards in these piles are known as downcards. A 2 is never going to have another card put on top of it if it stays on the tableau. This means that it can only block you from playing others cards. A 3, on the other hand, could have a blocking 2 moved on top of it. Don\u2019t score cards past 2 on your first turn unless they free up a downcard."

There\u2019s no advantage to moving a card out of the way to free a slot unless there\u2019s a king you can move to fill it and holding off will give you more options in the future.Tip: If you have choice between filling a slot on the tableau with a king from the waste pile or the board, choose a king from the board."

You can manipulate the waste piles to reveal new cards and you can rearrange stacks to get access to cards in the tableau piles, but you\u2019ll never be able to reach the downcards if you don\u2019t flip them.

This will give you the best opportunity at working through all of your downcards as the game progresses.Tip: The one exception to this rule is if you have a large set kings, queens, and jacks in your stock and a lot of empty columns on the tableau. In this case, work backwards and build out 4 piles from the kings first. For example, if you have a stack of 3 downcards and a stack of 6 downcards, and both of them have a black 7 that you can move, opt to use the black 7 in the pile with 6 downcards."

You can put lower numbers into the foundation once you find the aces and you can move kings around on open slots to free up higher cards, but the midrange cards are highly likely to get stuck where they are. Try to only move these cards when you have no other plays to avoid trapping a pile. It\u2019s okay to move a 5, 6, 7, or 8 if you\u2019re going to reveal a downcard."

In other words, if you play the 9 of clubs on top of the 10 of hearts, try to add more clubs and hearts to the pile. This will solve stalled games where an ace is trapped under a column that you can\u2019t move. For example, if you only have the ace of spades and the ace of hearts in the foundation, you can flip clean through a patterned column made up of spades and hearts to get to the downcards underneath. If they aren\u2019t in even patterns though, you won\u2019t be able to reach the downcards. This is a lot easier to do if you\u2019ve got access to the majority of the downcards and you have all the kings revealed."

Select your king based on which one would be more beneficial to the cards that are blocking more downcards. For example, if you have a red jack, red 8, black 7 and black queen blocking your downcards, a red king is a better choice for the free slot since all of those cards can be stacked on that king."

You may open up a new avenue of play that didn\u2019t exist before you moved through the waste pile. In general, you want to play cards from your waste pile after you\u2019ve exhausted all of your other options, but if you aren\u2019t going to reveal a downcard, score, or get access to a key card, flip through the waste pile first."
