Glue this to the card, then cut around the card carefully. Although the doll will be clothed, you can cover this up with the clothes you design.

  "text":" Making the Paper Doll Decide which supermodel you'd like to turn into a paper doll. Look for images of the supermodel online, to help you copy her or his features. You also have the opportunity to print out any full length photo that you think could be used as the doll in its own right. If cutting out an image of the whole supermodel, try to find one in bikini/beach wear/shorts, so that there aren't clothes in the way. If that's not possible, it's okay, just not as ideal. Even if you're drawing the supermodel (see next step), it might be fun and easiest to cut out the supermodel's face from a magazine or print it off from online, as this will make it look real. Draw the supermodel. Following the prompts from the images you've searched online. Use plain card that is strong but not too thick, to form the basis of the doll. The doll should be drawn bare except for its undergarments. If you're using a cut-out of a full-length image printed from the internet, cut around the design carefully. Glue this to the card, then cut around the card carefully. Although the doll will be clothed, you can cover this up with the clothes you design.

Be careful around areas such as the hands and feet; do not cut out individual fingers or toes, as this will make the paper doll too fragile and it's not needed anyway. Making Clothing for the Paper Doll Trace around the paper doll to get the right dimensions for the clothing. Place the doll on a sheet of paper and trace around its outline. Remove the doll. Put it to one side. Make the clothes using the template. Place tracing paper over the outline and draw trousers, tops, swimwear, dresses, skirts, shorts, etc. Transfer the drawings to suitable thick paper. This paper should be thinner than the card used for the doll but thick enough so that it won't tear with use. Printer paper may be suitable, if of good quality.
