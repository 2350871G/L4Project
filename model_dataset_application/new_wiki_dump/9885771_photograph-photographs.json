Test the shadows with a pencil to make sure they look the same on both sides. Tungsten lights may generate heat and damage sensitive materials, so use fluorescents or flash head bulbs. Take note of the color temperature of the lights. You will need to set the white balance on the camera to the same temperature to avoid color distortion."

  "text":" Taking Photos with a Phone Place the photo vertically, if possible. If the photo is laying down flat, there is a good chance that there will be shadows as you hold the camera over it. Use a photo frame or a small easel to support the photo. Hold your phone parallel to the picture. Avoid taking your photo from an angle, otherwise it will distort the image. To keep the phone steady and at a consistent angle, consider using a tripod that holds phones. Phone tripods can be purchased at many big box retailers. Light the photo from both sides.

It may take multiple attempts to get the picture to look completely clear, but it will help get a more clear picture than the stock camera app. Setting up a Digital Camera and Copy Stand Create a makeshift copy stand with a tripod and kitchen table. Extend one of the tripod legs fully to the ground while extending the other two legs out by half. Lean the tripod on the table and point the camera down so the lens is parallel to the table. Many photo equipment stores offer rentals on proper copy stands on an hourly or daily basis. Purchasing your own copy stand will cost around $220 for a full kit. Cover the table with a black backdrop. For a simple background, use a plain fabric sheet that will not reflect light. A black sheet helps eliminate any cast shadows that may appear if the photo does not lay flat. Light the tabletop from two sides.

Some newer camera models with wireless capabilities can be controlled from a phone or computer so you can also see the viewfinder without getting close to the camera. Shooting a Framed Photo Cut a hole the size of the lens in a dark piece of matte board. To avoid reflections of yourself or the rest of the room, cut a hole with a utility knife in a piece of black cardboard slightly larger than the size of the camera lens. Use a peanut butter jar lid or similarly sized circular object as a stencil. Point the lens through the cutout. Clamp the matte board to stands so it hangs at the height of your camera. With the camera on the tripod, position the end of the lens so it is flush with the matte board. You can also adjust the height of the tripod to reach the same level as the hole. Lay a black sheet down on the tabletop. This will help prevent any reflections from the table. Black absorbs light and color, so use a dull fabric to cover the entire table. Use an easel to hold the photo parallel to the camera. Try your best not to angle the photo because it will distort the image and cause unwanted reflections. If it needs to be slightly angled for the easel to stand, tilt your camera slightly so the photo and lens are parallel with one another. You can also lean the framed photo against a wall. Use a plain black backdrop if you do so, like a sheet or roll of paper. Position lights on either side of the photograph. Place the lights to the left and right of the table, pointing them at a 45-degree angle. This will help evenly light the photo while also preventing glare. Use the viewfinder on your camera to check for noticeable glares. If a glare is present, move the light stands closer to the photo.",
