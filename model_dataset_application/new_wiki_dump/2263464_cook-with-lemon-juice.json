          "description":"Every marinade is made of three key components: acid, oil, and flavorings. The oil moistens the meat while spices and herbs add flavor. The acid makes it all possible by breaking down the raw meat, thereby permitting the oil and spices to have an effect. Many marinades use vinegar for the acid, but lemon juice is just as effective and lends a citrus flavor. Use anywhere from 1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup (15 to 60 milliliters) lemon juice for marinades, depending on how much meat you use, how tender you want it to be, and how strong you want the lemon flavor to be."

You can marinate chicken for several hours without negatively affecting the texture, but while it is technically safe to allow chicken to marinate for up to two days, allowing it to sit this long will turn the texture tough and chewy."
