  "text":" Preparing the bananas and the batter Slice the bananas across their width. Since this is a Chinese recipe, you may wish to slice the bananas diagonally. Place some cornflour in a shallow bowl. This will be used to coat the bananas before dipping them in the batter. Make the batter: Stir together the self-raising flour and the cornflour. Add the cold water and vegetable oil to the flour mixture. Whisk well. Frying the bananas Fill a wok or deep-fryer one-third full of vegetable oil and heat to 190\u00b0C (375\u00b0F).  Toss the banana slices in the extra cornflour to lightly coat.  Using a bamboo skewer, dip each banana slice in the batter.  Cook the bananas in the hot oil, in batches, until golden and crisp.  Drain on paper towel.  Preparing the caramel Place the sugar in a large, heavy-bottomed pan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until a caramel forms. Keep an eye on the sugar as it cooks. It can come to a boil and burn very quickly. Coating the bananas with caramel Remove the caramel from the heat.  Add the friend bananas to the caramel one at a time, turning to coat thoroughly. You will need to work quickly, or the caramel will start to harden. Drop the coated bananas into a large bowl of ice and water. This will set the caramel. Remove the bananas from the ice water immediately once the caramel has set.  Finished. ",
