It will trap any extra soap scum, hair, or other debris, keeping it from going down the drain.

To install it you will first need to loosen and remove any current drain covers by either removing their fastener screws or rotating them until they come free. Then, follow the installation directions on the screen package. Most hang-down screens will require that you apply plumber\u2019s putty to their outer rim and then place them inside the pipe with the open end facing upwards."

You may need to hold it in place with a bit of plumber\u2019s putty or even your hand, as it may slide around a bit when water hits it. Remove the strainer and clean after each use to prevent hair accumulation."

The sheet is porous and will allow the water to flow through while trapping any hair or debris on the surface. Throw the sheet away after your shower. This method only works if your shower drain is covered enough so that the sheet will not get sucked down into the drain itself. If that happens, it can clog up your pipes."

Try to get off the matted areas and any clumps of loose hair before putting them under the water. In addition, if your dog is muddy, try to remove any larger chunks of dirt before bathing. To minimize the strain on your drain, when the weather is warm you might want to bathe your pets outside instead, if possible. For smaller pets, you could even use a baby bathtub to bathe them, then dump the water outside after so it does not go down your drain."

This is better than letting them go on down the drain. When you step out of the shower or bath, wipe up these hairs with your hands or a paper towel and toss them in the trash.

Be extra careful when putting on your make-up above the bathroom sink, for example. Placing extra screens on all drains can help to minimize these seemingly random clogs. Remove caps from razors to prevent them from falling into the drain of your sink or bathtub. These can get stuck and make clogs even worse."
