          "description":"This type of indigo tolerates cold weather best, though it may not thrive if your area has long winters, meaning longer than 4 months. It's a subshrub, which means it's thinner than a shrub, and will grow to about 3 to 6 feet (0.91 to 1.83 m). Keep in mind that Isatis tintoria has only 1/4 of the dye pigment contained in other varieties of indigo, so it may need additional plants if you want to create your own dye. Although indigo plants are perennials, they behave as an annual in non-tropical climates. However, varieties other than Isatis tinctoria may not grow into full-sized plants in non-tropical regions. You should choose seeds that are less than 2 years old, as older seeds are unlikely to germinate."

The 6 hours of sun doesn't have to be continuous sun. For example, your plot could get 3 hours of sun in the morning and 3 hours of sun in the afternoon, with part shade in the middle of the day. It\u2019s a good idea to check the spot at different times of the day to see if it\u2019s sunny at that time."

You can mix the soil by hand with a shovel or trowel, or you can use a tiller. Mix the sand into the top 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of soil. You can test the soil by checking it after a storm. If there are a lot of puddles, the soil doesn\u2019t drain well. If the water flows away quickly, then the soil drains well. If you don\u2019t want to wait for a storm, you can water the plot to see how well it drains. If your plot doesn\u2019t drain well, don\u2019t despair!

It\u2019s best to till the manure and fertilizer into the soil, if you have a tiller. You can also buy pre-mixed soil from your local gardening center.

Check the plot for weeds every time you water the plants, as the best way to prevent them is to stop them from sprouting in the first place. It's easiest to weed when the ground is wet, so do it after a watering. If you don't see a root system at the bottom of a weed you just pulled, you can dig it out of the soil using a small shovel or trowel.
