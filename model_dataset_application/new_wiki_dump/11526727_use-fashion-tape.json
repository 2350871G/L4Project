For small fixes, use a piece of tape that\u2019s 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) long. If you\u2019re securing a larger portion of clothing, use a strip of tape that\u2019s at least 4 to 5 in (10 to 13 cm). For instance, you only need a small piece of tape to secure the gaps between the buttons on your shirt."
