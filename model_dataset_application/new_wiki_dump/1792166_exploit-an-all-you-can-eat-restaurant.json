Some restaurants have different rates for different days of the week and times of the day. If you are on a budget, find the best time."

Sweet or alcoholic drinks also require more water to digest them so avoid them or drink more water to keep your balance. Refill as you go, never go thirsty! Iced water will facilitate the opening of the pylorus (the link between the stomach and the intestine) and thus help your digestion."
