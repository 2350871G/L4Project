  "text":" If you don't have one already, make a Velcro band to go around the flash.  Determine the size of your flash. Do this by measuring the circumference of your flash in some manner. You want to have the Velcro band on it and measure it also. If you are using something to pad the duct tape sheet, lay it down.  Using the silver duct tape, apply the pad to one side of the material.  After the first side of your duct tape sheet is complete, make sure that it is squared.  Take your black duct tape and line the other side. You want all four sides to be about a half inch beyond the rest of the project. Cut the edges of the black duct tape down to the half inch border that you need. Try to make the edges as smooth as you can. Miter the corners so that the edges won't overlap each other. You are striving for a more professional look. Fold over all the edges.  If you wrap the snoot around your flash and find out that it is not big enough, just add more duct tape to the sheet without the benefit of the padding.  Apply the Velcro along the edge that will go around the flash. Do this only if you are going to use a Velcro band around your flash to secure it. Here is what the Velcro should look like. Do this to that entire side of the sheet. Repeat this process on an adjacent edge that you have already done. It does not have to be the entire width, if you don't want to (or if you ran out). Fasten your unfinished snoot to the flash. You need to do this to determine where to put the other strip of Velcro. Apply the strip of Velcro to the other strip that you have already fastened.  Carefully place that strip where you want it and it needs to be according to what you have already placed.  You're done. Enjoy your snoot.",
