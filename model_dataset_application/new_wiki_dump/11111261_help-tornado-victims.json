Check with non-disaster-relief organizations in the area, such as schools, libraries, homeless shelters, animal shelters, food banks, churches, and social service organizations to find out what they are doing and how you can get involved. For example, in the wake of the recent Lee County tornado in Alabama, churches, grocery stores, schools, and animal shelters in the area gathered donations of supplies and money for the community.

Research reputable national disaster relief networks and see if there are any local branches in the affected area. For example, Direct Relief, an organization that focuses on providing medical assistance to communities in need, works with local groups to provide critical supplies after tornadoes and other disasters. Feeding America works with community food banks across the U.S. The Red Cross also has local branches in communities all over the world."

          "description":"In the wake of a disaster, people need a wide variety of different types of assistance. They may need goods, shelter, medical care, or food. When you donate money to disaster relief organizations or charities, they can figure out how to use your contribution in the most effective and efficient way possible. If possible, donate money rather than goods unless an organization is specifically asking for material donations. Monetary donations allow rescue organizations to purchase goods locally without having to worry about shipping costs and quality control checks. They can also tailor their purchases to the exact needs of members of the community. For example, after the tornado that recently hit El Reno, Oklahoma, the local Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) branch is looking for donations of cash and gift cards to help residents purchase food, gas, and other necessities. The Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma also reached out for cash donations (as opposed to donations of food or supplies) after the Moore tornado."

However, first check with the organization(s) you\u2019re working with to find out exactly what is needed. Otherwise, aid organizations can end up overwhelmed with material donations that they are unable to use.Tip: In addition to donating money or goods, you may also be able to help by donating blood through organizations like the Red Cross, the United Blood Services, or the Armed Services Blood Program. Call the organization you\u2019d like to donate to or check their website to find out what kinds of donations they are taking."

Contact rescue organizations in the affected area and find out what kinds of help they need. You can also reach out to National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD) at https://www.nvoad.org/ to find volunteer opportunities. Don\u2019t jump in and try to help with search and rescue efforts or other potentially dangerous activities on your own. It\u2019s important to work with an existing volunteer organization that has already identified safe and effective ways to help out. Ways to volunteer may include making calls for donations, cooking meals for survivors, delivering supplies, or getting involved in search and rescue operations."
