          "description":"Generally, grills will have a built in thermometer where you can monitor the temperature. However, if your grill doesn\u2019t have a thermometer, you insert a large meat thermometer into the top vent to check the temperature. If possible, place your grill in a shielded area where wind will not hit it directly. Wind and the outside temperature can have an effect on the internal temperature of the grill."

          "headline":"Put charcoal in your grill.",
          "description":"Roasting your pig requires that you grill it over charcoal. Light your charcoal and let it burn until it has turned a nice ash-grey color. Place a heavy piece of wire roughly the size of the pig you intend to cook onto the grill. The wire should be roughly 13 inches (33.0 cm) above the now ash-grey charcoal. If you are using a gas grill, you will need to use approximately one 40 pound cylinder of gas to complete this project."

          "description":"Doing this will help it to lie flat in the grill. Try not to pierce the skin at all with the ribs. Lay the pig onto the wire so that it is skin-side up and as flat as it can possibly go. Place another piece of wire on top of the pig so that it is sandwiched in between the two pieces of wire."

          "headline":"Estimate the cooking time.",
          "description":"There are quite a few factors that will determine how long your pig actually needs to be cooked--weight of the pig, temperature of the coals, temperature outside, etc. However, here is a rough approximation of the cooking time it should take to cook your pig:\n75 pound pig: Cooking over 60 pounds of charcoal, your pig should cook in six to seven hours. 100 pound pig: Cooking over 70 pounds of charcoal, your pig should cook in 7 to 8 hours. 125 pound pig: Cooking over 80 pounds of charcoal, your pig should cook in 8 to 9 hours."

          "description":"Halfway through the cooking process (so after roughly 3.5 to 4 hours), you should flip your pig so that the skin-side now faces down. Your pig will be done cooking when its internal temperature is 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). Stick the meat thermometer into the ham of the pig as it will give you the best reading of the thermometer because it is the largest part of the pig. The ham is the hind thigh and upper back leg of the pig."
