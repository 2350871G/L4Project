Place a dollop of the mixture on a small piece of wax paper and place the trap in an area with a high volume of odorous ant traffic. Place another trap near the entrances the ants are using to come into the house. If you don\u2019t have mint jelly, you could use another jelly as long as it is not sugar-free. You can obtain boric acid at your local pharmacy or hardware store. After a few days, the ants will no longer be interested in the sugar-based trap. Discard old traps and replace them with a new batch every few days."

        {
          "headline":"Make a protein-based trap.",
          "description":"Since odorous ants are also attracted to protein or grease-based traps, place a protein-based trap alongside each sugar-based trap. You can easily make a protein-based trap by mixing two tablespoons of honey, two tablespoons of peanut butter, and 1/2 teaspoon of boric acid powder. Just as you did with the sugar-based trap, scoop a bit of the bait on some wax paper and leave it near the odorous ants\u2019 points of entry. Replace trap every other day or so, since it will not be appealing to the ants after it dries up."

Many ant traps are meant to be used against specific ant species, so look for one that is designed to be most effective against odorous ants. While the exact directions for use vary according to manufacturer, you can generally snap off one of the ant traps from the packet and place it near the ants\u2019 point of entry or their trail.

While the exact amount of essential oil you will need depends on the concentration of oil you\u2019ve obtained, you can generally mix the essential oil of you choice with water in a 1:99 ratio. In other words, you might mix half a teaspoon of cinnamon essential oil with 49.5 teaspoons of water. Some essential oils are not appropriate for use around pets and children. Consult the manufacturer instructions on your essential oil bottle before use."
