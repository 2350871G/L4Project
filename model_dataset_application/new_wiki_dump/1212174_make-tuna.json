Nowadays, frozen fillets at a fishmonger can be high quality, and much cheaper than the fresh stuff. Look for cuts that are neatly trimmed, with firm, dark red flesh. Avoid any with discolored flesh around the bone, or with a brown tinge. Thick cuts are necessary to create a seared crust without overcooking the inner flesh. Aim for a cut at least 1\u00bc\" (3.2 cm) thick."
