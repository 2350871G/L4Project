Parasites are for the long con. If you have time to walk away from the computer for 5 or 10 minutes at a time while your bug accumulates points, it's not a bad way to go. For more immediate gratification, though, stick to the viruses or bacteria."

Argentina, Peru, Indonesia, Greenland and Madagascar are all ideal locations for starting. Brute force your way into Madagascar. A common Pandemic 2 strategy is simply restarting the game until you luck out and start in Madagascar. It can take some time, but it ensures you won't miss out on infecting the island."

This makes it so your bug can fly under the radar and accumulate evolution points. Note that it does cost evolution points to sell your symptoms right away, but it's worth it. Don't worry, you'll buy up better symptoms later!"

You can buy rodent and insect, but they're more noticeable and not as effective. However, if your disease isn't spreading as quickly as you'd like, go ahead and buy them."

Don't buy another level of the resistance you had when you started. Focus your points on upgrading the others. Buy what's related to the country where your disease started, as well as the places where the ships and planes from your country go. Here's a basic rundown of each region:Cold: Russia, Canada, Greenland and West Europe. Heat:  Mexico, Brazil, Africa, Australia, West Europe, Madagascar, India and the Middle East. Moisture: Cuba, Peru, Argentina, Indonesia, Japan and Australia."

      "description":"When you've infected every area, sit back and let the evolution points build for a little bit. Once you have around 50, move on to the next step. Pay attention to vaccine development. Click the World tab and check on the vaccine progress. If you notice that a vaccine is less than 30 days to completion, and more than half of the hospitals are working on it, buy a drug resistance level. Keep checking up on it every so often and just buy another level every time it's getting too close. When enough hospitals shut down, you won't have to worry about it."

For maximum annihilation, wait for a big natural disaster to strike, then move in. Here are some symptoms that work well:\nSneezing and coughing: Spread your disease around faster. Fever: Increases lethality\nHemorrhaging and kidney failure: These ones are expensive, but deadly. Don't bother unlocking Tier 4. It costs too many points, and you can do just as much damage with the symptoms in the first three tiers."
