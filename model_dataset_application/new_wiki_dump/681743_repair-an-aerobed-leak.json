If the mattress is new, a leak in the seam may indicate a defect or poor quality. Gather your materials. You will need an air mattress repair kit or the equivalent components: a vinyl adhesive and a vinyl patch. When purchasing adhesives, look for urethane glues like McNett\u2019s Seam Grip or Coleman\u2019s Seam Sealer. Instead of urethane glue, you can try rubber cement. Cut a patch from a repair kit or a spare piece of vinyl so that it will cover the tear.  Smear an ample amount of adhesive over the tear.

If you\u2019re fixing a seam on a flocked surface, use more adhesive to ensure that the two sides of the seam stick together. Press the two sides of the seam together. The goal is to make sure that both sides of the opening remain in contact while the adhesives sets up. Consider using clothespins to hold the two sides of the tear together. Just be careful not to glue the clothespins to the mattress. Let the adhesive dry almost completely. This is called \u201csetting up\u201d and will take a few hours. Apply a layer of adhesive to the patch.  Place the vinyl patch onto the newly applied rubber cement, following the instructions on your repair kit.  Allow the adhesive to dry completely. Drying times will vary depending on the adhesive but 6-8 hours is a good bet. Repairing the Valve Assess the damage. Is there a hole or a crack? A hole will be easier to fix than a crack. If there\u2019s a crack you might need to order a new valve from the air mattress manufacturer. This is a long-shot method and may not always work. Often, a severely damaged valve means that you\u2019ll need to buy a new mattress. Plug the hole by filling it with rubber cement or seam sealer.  Seal the valve. If the valve is leaking air because the valve plug isn\u2019t properly sealing against the valve stem, you can line the stem with a thin piece of plastic to help it seal properly. Replace the valve. If the valve is damaged beyond repair, order a new one from the manufacturer and replace it according to the instructions. Checking your work Re-inflate the mattress.
