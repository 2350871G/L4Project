It can linger in the environment for hundreds of years and never break down completely, polluting the soil and groundwater. When plastics are not disposed of properly, they kill animals who mistake them for food. You can help to prevent this from happening by: \nBuying or making reusable bags. Leave a couple in your car/on your bike for shopping. Tuck a small one into your purse for unplanned trips to the grocery store. Asking your local grocery store to replace plastic bags with recycled paper bags or cardboard boxes. Even \u201cbiodegradable\u201d plastic bags can end up in landfills, where they don\u2019t break down properly. This makes them just as dangerous as regular plastic."

Plastics with these codes are generally safe to be reused for storing food. Any other number is either unsafe or not durable enough for reuse. If your plastic is not considered to be food-safe, you can recycle it or reuse it for arts and crafts. For example, plastic tubs are great for storing water to rinse paintbrushes with."

If your grocery store sells products in bulk, take advantage of it and fill up using your own containers. If you have a choice between paper or plastic bags, stick with paper.

Search for what they will and won\u2019t recycle. Check their sorting requirements, as well. For example, most recycling plants won\u2019t recycle tissues, wax paper, or polystyrene. Unless they offer single-stream recycling, you\u2019ll likely have to separate paper, plastics, glass, and metals. In some cities, recycling plants pay money for aluminum cans. Search online to see if your city offers this service. If it does, look for what kinds of aluminum cans are accepted. For example, some centers accept beverage cans but not pet food cans."

They also last much longer (5 to 20 years), saving you lots of money in the long run. CFLs and LEDs are brighter than incandescent bulbs. If you\u2019re sensitive to bright lights, look into fitting your lamps with darker lamp shades. For ceiling fixtures, consider installing LED-compatible dimmers."

By reducing your use of lighting, you will not only help conserve energy, but also save on electricity bills. Keep the lights off in rooms that you are not currently using. On sunny days, open the curtains for some free solar lighting. Consider switching to timers or motion sensors if you need lights on in unused areas for security or safety reasons. This is great for garden pathways. Use dimmers and less lighting later at night to help your body get ready for sleep. Switch to smaller, energy-efficient lights. If you\u2019re reading or sewing, use a desk lamp rather than a ceiling lamp."

Adjusting the temperature just one or two degrees can help to conserve resources. To maximize your comfort, dress warmly and use thick blankets during colder weather. When it\u2019s hot outside, close the blinds on east-facing windows in the morning and west-facing windows in the afternoon.

If it\u2019s cool and/or rainy (or if you\u2019re drying your undergarments), dry your clothes indoors on drying racks. Your clothes will take slightly longer to dry, but the planet and your wallet will thank you. Clothes dryers can be rough on clothing.

Check with your city or state/provincial government to see if they offer these incentives. Solar panels come in a variety of sizes for rooftops and yards. If you prefer wind power, you can build or buy a turbine small enough for your backyard. If you\u2019re an apartment/condo dweller or if you rent your home, look into buying offsets.
