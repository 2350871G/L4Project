          "description":"Since vellum is a cloudy, translucent surface, it works great for creating classic looking titles and quotes in almost any color. Insert 8.5 by 11 inch vellum paper sheets into your printer as you would normal paper. Open up a word processing program and type in titles or quotes. If you plan to cut the titles into smaller rectangles before affixing them to your scrapbook page, you can print many titles on the same page of vellum. Once your document with text is completed, print it out on a normal printer. Leave the sheet for at least 5 minutes before removing it from your printer tray, because vellum takes much longer to dry ink than normal paper. Cut the titles and affix them to each page. Open a photo editing program. Choose a photo that you want to appear as an accent or shadow on your page. Print the photo out on a piece of vellum paper in the size you desire. Cut it into a smaller size and layer it onto your page with adhesive glue."
