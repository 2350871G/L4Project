These are more or less colorless in appearance and much of the time has a milder taste than other spirits. Colorless spirits include:\nVodka\nGin\n(Unaged) Cacha\u00e7a\nNeutral Grain Spirit\nSoju\n\n\nWhiskeys. Whiskeys are made from fermented grain mash, with the grain used changing from type to type. Whiskey is popular around the world but primarily manufactured in Scotland, Ireland, America, Canada, and Japan, each of which have distinct flavors. The types of whiskey include:\nBourbon\nScotch\nRye\nIrish\nCanadian\nJapanese\n\nOther colored spirits. There are dozens of different kinds of spirits that would make sense in a cocktail.

          "description":"Sometimes, a drink with a lower alcohol concentration is chosen to enhance the flavor of the spirit. If you're going to use 2 types of alcohol in combination, be sure to test whether their tastes are compatible. Gin and light beer may work in a refreshing drink with lemon and honey, or beer and tequila may work as a \"beer-garita,\" but ouzo and red wine probably aren't likely to be paired anytime soon. Beer and wine cocktails have become increasingly popular over the years. Experiment with beer, for example, by making a simple Shandy from lemonade and beer. Experiment with wine by making a Kalimotxo, or red wine and cola. Or try a French 75, which combines gin, sparkling wine, lemon, and sugar."
