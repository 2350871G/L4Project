Start by turning all of the buttons to a neutral position or hit the \u2018off\u2019 button, if your machine has one. Switch the power off from the wall socket and unplug your washer. Make sure that you leave the plug in a safe location where it cannot get wet during the cleaning process. You should also put down old towels in front of your washer to soak up any possible water build up that may come free once the filter is removed."

If you have an older top-loading washer, your filter will also be in the bottom right-hand corner of the machine. However, most top-loading washers, such as Siemens, have self-cleaning filters located underneath the agitator. The agitator is the device located directly in the center of the machine that rotates back and forth during the wash cycle. Self-cleaning filters still need to be cleaned every 3 to 4 months. If the filter is located in the bottom right-hand corner of the machine it will have a rectangular or circular cover over it. If you are unable to locate your filter, consult the owner\u2019s manual."

To remove these covers, use a thin object, such as a screwdriver, to pry the cover off. Once you can grab the cover, turn it counter-clockwise until you can remove it completely. If your filter is located underneath the agitator, remove the agitator first. Take the cap off of the agitator and put your hand inside the shaft until you feel a wing-nut screw. Twist the screw counter-clockwise until it is removed and you can lift the agitator out of the machine. After you have removed the agitator, lift the filter cover out of position."

This should loosen up any lint or detergent that may be causing it to stick. As you remove your filter, you should see a layer of wet lint mixed with detergent. In some washers, the draining hose will be located directly in front of the filter. If the drain hose blocks the filter from coming out, remove it and then pull out the filter."
