      "description":"If your wanting to get the level 55 player then be sure to use an assault rifle(best to do with overkill where you can carry two weapons{ex. sniper rifle and M4}). Usually a sniper rifle isn't the best matching rifle to hunt someone of a level 55's stature. Reasoning behind this is because when you're in a game with a good 55, chances are you will not be seeing them a lot, so a sniper rifle is a no no."

      "description":"If you have the thought in the back of your mind that they are level 55 and that you're gonna get stomped; specially in cage matches then your most likely going to get beat, or it'll be close, unless they aren't as good as you might be. I always have confidence, cause I have beaten a level 55 that was way more experienced than me in a cage match before. So be sure to have confidence in yourself."

So make sure at the first games, your finishing at the top of the final scoreboard(preferably 1st of course).Basically you want to take Step 5 and have them not follow it. You want the opponent to have that nasty thought in the back of their head, on that you are too good for them."
