Add how much you will have to pay for pool maintenance and property taxes each year to your pool\u2019s installation price to determine the actual long-term cost of the pool you buy. The cost of maintenance varies between different types of pools; more elaborate pools often require more expensive maintenance. You may also see your property taxes go up after buying a pool, depending on your local municipality\u2019s tax policy. On the plus side, if your local housing market is on the upswing, then adding a pool to your property may ultimately increase its resale value."
