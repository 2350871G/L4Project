Use a large white Paintbrush to quickly erase any details that you don't want to see. Use a black Paintbrush to fill in areas of white to make solid black spaces. You can use the Crop tool to quickly cut out large chunks of the image that you don't want to use."

      "description":"When you cut and print the stencil, you will be cutting away the black spaces to paint through. This means that if there are isolated details in white, they will need to be connected to the rest of the white space so that you can cut it properly. Use the white Paintbrush to quickly connect your islands to the rest of the white space. Keep the strength of your finished stencil in mind and create any additional links to maintain its structure when using it."

If you are using newer versions of Photoshop (CS6+), you'll need to select \"Preferences\" \u2192 \"Plug-ins\" \u2192 \"Show All Filter Gallery Groups and Names\" before you can see the Artistic filters."
