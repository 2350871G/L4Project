  "text":" Preparing the Bread Layers Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC/350\u00baF. Prepare the ovenproof baking dish by greasing with the margarine. Place the margarine, cinnamon, ginger and orange zest into the mixing bowl. Stir to combine. Spread margarine on the bread pieces. Cut the bread pieces into halves, diagonally. Arrange about a third of the cut slices in the prepared baking dish, just one layer. Cut the apricots (or other dried fruit) roughly. Add to the sultanas and mix together. Sprinkle a third of the mixture across the first layer in the baking dish. Add the second layer of bread spread with margarine. Add another third of the apricot and sultana mix. Finish with one more layer of bread slices. Put to one side, including the remaining dried fruit mixture (it will be used shortly). Preparing the Custard Take the halved vanilla pod and scrape out the seeds. Place the seeds into the saucepan. Add the non-dairy milk, cornflour and sugar. Pour in 400ml (13.5 fl oz) of water. Whisk well to combine all of the ingredients until a smooth mixture forms. Cook over a medium-low heat. Simmer gently for 8 to 10 minutes. Whisk continuously as it cooks. When it is almost boiling and coats the back of a wooden spoon with falling off, it is done. Remove from the heat. Do not neglect to keep whisking or the custard may become lumpy or even burn. Making the Bread and Butter Pudding Pour the warm custard over the bread slices already laid out in the baking dish. Pour the custard evenly across all slices, allowing it to ooze to the base of the dish as well. Sprinkle the remaining dried apricot and sultana mix over the top of the custard. Allow the dish to sit for 20 minutes. This will allow the flavours to infuse through the whole dish. While this is infusing, preheat the oven to 200\u00baC/400\u00baF. Place the bread and butter mixture into the oven. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes. The pudding is ready for adding the topping (see next) when it has turned a light gold colour and looks set. Finishing Up Prepare the marmalade while the pudding is baking. Warm it in a pan on low heat until it melts sufficiently. Set aside for use as a glaze when the pudding is ready. Remove the baked pudding from the oven. Spread the warm marmalade topping over the surface of the pudding. Place back in the oven to cook for just another 5 minutes. The pudding is ready when it turns golden. Remove the pudding from the oven. Allow to cool just a little, then dust with icing (powdered) sugar. Serve immediately. Divide into portions to serve on plates or in bowls. Add some vegan cream or ice cream, optional.",
