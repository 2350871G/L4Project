Use it to clean sinks, countertops, tubs, tile, bathroom floors, or even your grill. Pour a bit of baking soda down your drain if it has a sour odor. Turn on the water and flip on the disposal to remove gunk and leave your sink smelling fresh."

It can also remove grime and grease from your utensils just as well as what you buy in the store. Add a tablespoon of baking soda to your washing machine to help your ordinary laundry detergent clean clothes better. Sprinkle baking soda on your carpet or rugs, wait 15 minutes, then vacuum for a fresh and clean floor."

You can also add salt to the lemon juice to polish items such as metal grills and chrome appliances. Dilute lemon juice with water to clean wooden cutting boards.

Add a drop or two of your favorite essential oil to the vinegar to make your cleaning solution smell fantastic.

Use a soft cloth and circular motions to apply the oil to the wood. Try adding a drop or two of vinegar to the olive oil on your cloth if the wood is especially dirty. You can also use olive oil to get scratches out of leather. Simply apply a drop or two and rub it in. Put a splash of olive oil and a teaspoon of coarse salt in a cast iron skillet. Scrub with a stiff brush then rinse with hot water."
