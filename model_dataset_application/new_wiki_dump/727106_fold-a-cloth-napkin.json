You can set this napkin on top of a dinner plate, or you can put it off to the side of the plate, just depending on what look you prefer. Folding a Napkin into a Standing Fan Fold a rectangular or square napkin in half lengthwise. Position the napkin so that the crease of the fold is either on your left- or right-hand side, instead of on the top or bottom.Tip: A rectangular napkin will create a fuller fan, but a square napkin will give you really similar results. Bring the bottom edge of the napkin up about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm). This is the first fold in the process of making the actual fan. However far you end up folding this bottom edge is how wide each of your subsequent folds will need to be. For this particular fold, it really helps the napkin keep its shape if it has crisp creases along each fold. Use an iron if you\u2019re having trouble getting the napkin to keep its shape. Accordion-fold the napkin almost all the way to the top. Maintain the \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) folds all the way up so that each section is as equal in size as possible. Leave the last \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) at the top unfolded. To accordion-fold, simply fold the napkin under and then over, back and forth, until the entirety of the fabric is \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) wide. Pick up the napkin carefully and fold it in half. After you\u2019re done folding the napkin accordion-style, carefully pick it up from the table. Bring the 2 ends of the napkin together so that it is folded in half equally.

Set the napkin on a flat surface while you hold the middle together. At this stage, the napkin should look like a fan. It isn\u2019t able to fully stand up on its own yet without falling apart, but you should be able to see its final form taking shape. Create a triangle from the middle pieces\u2019 corners to keep them in place. Take the 2 middlemost pieces, which should have corners extending out from them from the fabric left unfolded earlier, and fold those corners down in one direction to essentially fasten them together. Tuck them into the closest fold so they\u2019ll stay in place and keep the fan together. Place the napkin on a dinner plate and make the final adjustments. Carefully move the napkin to its place at the table. Look at the front of the fan\u2014there are probably a few pleats that can be straightened or fluffed so that the napkin fully resembles a fan. You could also make a fan for a napkin ring if you\u2019d prefer to use rings with your place setting. Creating a Rose Fold a square napkin in half to create a triangle. Bring the top-left corner over to meet the bottom-right corner. Leave a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) border around the edges so that the bottom layer slightly extends past the top layer. Make sure you\u2019re working on a clean, flat surface. It\u2019ll be much easier to roll and fold the napkin this way. Roll up the bottom of the napkin until there are 3 to 5 inches (7.6 to 12.7 cm) of material left. Position the napkin so that the long creased fold is closest to your body and the top of the triangle is pointing away from you. Roll the material upwards toward the top as tightly as you can.

While it should be pretty secure, pulling at the material a lot could mess up the look of it. Forming a Christmas Tree Lay a square napkin out flat in front of you and fold it into quarters. Use a clean, ironed napkin. Work on a flat surface so that it\u2019s easier to make crisp folds in the napkin. For this particular fold, use green or red napkins for an even more festive look. Position the napkin so that the open flaps are pointing at your body. There is one side of the folded napkin that has an opening. This is the side you want to move so that it\u2019s closest to your body. Bring the topmost layer up to create a triangle. Leave a small border, about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) so that the top layer isn\u2019t laying exactly flush with the bottom layers. The border will eventually help to form the different levels of the tree. Make an upward fold with each remaining flap, always leaving a border. Bring up each remaining flap, one by one, until they are about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) from being flush with the previously folded flap. If you\u2019re having trouble getting your folds to lay flat, use an iron to make more defined creases. In all, there should be 5 visible triangles when you\u2019re finished making your folds. Flip the napkin over and fold the right side over about 1/3 of the way. Bring the bottom-right corner up so that it touches the edge of the left-hand side and creates another smaller triangle. Repeat this fold on the left side so that the napkin is folded into thirds. The goal is to make the folds on both the left and the right sides as even as possible so that your tree will be symmetrical. Take your time and refold if needed. Fold the top of the napkin down and flip the napkin over once again. There is a small triangle at the top of the napkin. Fold it down so that you create a flat edge. This fold actually forms the base of your Christmas tree! Peeking from behind this edge will be a much smaller triangle from the material on the other side of the napkin\u2014leave this piece of fabric unfolded, as it is meant to be the top of your tree. Tuck the hanging flaps up into the napkin to finish your tree. You will make 4 final folds to hide the pointed ends of each section. Simply tuck them upwards so that they are caught within the napkin itself. Do your best to keep the folded material as flat as possible. When you\u2019re done, you can place the tree on a dinner plate for a festive presentation.",
