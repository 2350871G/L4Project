          "description":"You can use any vegetables you want for your snack, but try carrots, celery stalks, green peppers, radish, or jicama since they\u2019ll complement the flavors well. Wash and cut the vegetables into 3 in (7.6 cm) sticks so they\u2019re easier to dip. Scoop out the salsa with the vegetables or use a spoon to put some onto the end of the vegetable stick. This works best with thicker salsas since loose salsa may not stick on the vegetables as well. You can also try using cut peppers, sugar snap peas, or cucumber with your salsa as well."

Dip the cracker in the salsa so some of the chunks stay on top of the cracker. If you\u2019re worried about the cracker breaking when you dip it, use a spoon to scoop the salsa onto it instead.Put small slices of cheese on your crackers before dipping them if you want a richer flavor.Variation: If you have a fruit salsa, try using graham crackers if you want to have a sweeter snack."

Be sure not to eat the shrimp\u2019s tail since it\u2019s inedible.You can also combine salsa with cocktail sauce if you want to mix the flavors together.
