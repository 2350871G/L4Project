It points out, for example, that all combustion (including in internal combustion engines) involves vapor, and that it is therefore possible to filter and isolate combustible vapor from burning biomass such as wood pellets. Biomass gasifiers don\u2019t create liquid fuel, only combustible vapors. However, it\u2019s important to remember that internal combustion engines vaporize liquid fuel anyway. Section I also presents an interesting historical account of the process, including how widespread the use of biomass gasification was in Europe during World War II."

So, the biomass gasifier it describes uses widely available parts such as a metal trash can and sections of piping. However, that doesn\u2019t mean building the gasifier is an easy job that everyone can handle. In basic terms, the wood pellets or shavings are burned in one chamber of the gasifier, the smoke is filtered through more wood pellets/shavings in a second chamber, and the filtered vapor is mixed with air as it enters the intake valve of the internal combustion engine. You\u2019re using fire to create combustible vapors, so it\u2019s essential that you follow the directions very closely and take every recommended safety precaution.

          "description":"In very basic terms, the Fischer-Tropsch process adds high temperature, high pressure, and a heavy metal catalyst (like iron or cobalt) to the typical biomass gasification process. As a result, it can be used to create liquid synthetic gasoline out of biomass like wood pellets or organic trash. The high heat and pressure convert the biomass into a mix of carbon dioxide and hydrogen, at which point impurities can be filtered out. Then, the introduction of a heavy metal catalyst turns the carbon dioxide and hydrogen into long-chain hydrocarbons that are cooled and condensed into a liquid."

However, while it\u2019s theoretically possible to replicate using widely-available materials, creating a Fischer-Tropsch converter is likely beyond the capabilities of most people. It relies on temperatures of at least 300 \u00b0C (572 \u00b0F) and preferably 1,000 \u00b0C (1,830 \u00b0F), and pressures of up to tens of atmospheres.
