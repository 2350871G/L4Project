Even ten minutes of thawing can render fish unsafe. If your storage bag has been sitting in a warm car, make sure you pick up some ice or another method of keeping items cold."

          "description":"Before placing your fish in the freezer, check the packaging it came in. If you find any holes or tears, wrap your fish in wax paper or foil to preserve flavor and moisture. Direct exposure to the frigid temperatures of a freezer can cause dryness and freezer burn. Do not skip this step to ensure high-quality, tender fish."

If you cannot cook it right away, you can place it in a crockpot or other slow-cooking tool and come back to it later. This is partly due to taste (re-frozen fish tends to have a dry texture and loss of flavor), and partly due to safety, as the thawing process may have allowed bacteria to grow."

The solution is to place your fish on ice (directly, or still wrapped) inside of the fridge. As the ice melts, you\u2019ll need to drain it, so keep this in mind when choosing a storage method. When you purchase fresh fish, it should be in a similar configuration: over ice, in a sealed container. If your fresh fish is not stored properly prior to purchasing it, skip it. Sort through shellfish, and throw away any with cracked or broken shells, as they may have been contaminated."

If you cannot get to it within that time frame, cook it and store the cooked fish, which will last a bit longer, and will not run as high a risk of spoiling. If you cannot get to your fresh fish within two days, follow the freezing recommendations to salvage the fish you\u2019ve not gotten to."
