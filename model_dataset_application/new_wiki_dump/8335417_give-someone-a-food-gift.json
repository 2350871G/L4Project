          "description":"Head down to your local deli or supermarket and review their selection of specialty snacks. Aged meat and cheese platters are usually a hit, but you can also find a treasure trove of finger sandwiches, olives, breads, crackers and dips. All will make convenient, delicious displays the next time new neighbors move in down the street. Charcuterie trays are a safe choice, as they include a little bit of everything. Order these in advance and pick them up shortly before you exchange gifts to ensure that they\u2019re fresh."

          "headline":"Order a gift basket.",
          "description":"Edible gift baskets are a fun, festive way to show someone that you\u2019re thinking about them. Most of these are made up of fresh fruits and chocolates, but they can also include selections of specialty meats, cheeses, crackers and sweets. Like a bouquet, they feature an array of bright colors and beautiful designs, but unlike a bouquet you can snack on them with your friends, family or coworkers throughout the day. Check out companies like Harry & David, Swiss Colony, iGourmet and the original Edible Arrangements. Pick up an edible gift basket to give as a housewarming gift, or have it delivered straight to the recipient's home or workplace. Food baskets typically average around $50-60, but can get as pricey as a few hundred for more elaborate pairings."

If you want, you can update the motif by choosing uncommon or sophisticated candies like caramels, chocolate turtles, toffee, or Turkish delight. Just tie a bow around the package and your work is done. Look for candy shops in your area that offer high-quality artisan sweets. Include a variety of candies as an extra with a larger gift."

          "description":"Not all food gifts have to be eaten. There are also specialty beverages and drink accessories like mulling spices, foreign sodas or alcohol that can be enjoyed hot, cold or with other tasty fare. Place an assortment of coffees, teas or liquors in a basket with a few simple finger foods, or select a bottle of vintage wine and propose a toast to health, friendship and good cheer. Hot cocoa and cider make great potable presents for the chilly months around the holidays. Think before giving alcohol. If your intended recipient is underage, pregnant or has a history of alcoholism, it may not be the best gift idea."

Throw a yeasty sourdough, rye or pumpernickel in the oven, using made-from-scratch dough and fresh ingredients. Bread can come in a ton of different varieties, so it makes a great edible gift year-round. You can bake bread in large batches overnight, which is useful if you\u2019re preparing it for a lot of people. Don\u2019t forget about dessert varieties, such as cinnamon-raisin, banana nut or pull-apart monkey bread."

Whether it\u2019s a simple yet delicious red velvet cake, a pound cake, strawberry cheesecake, or a key lime, pumpkin or peach and praline pie, it\u2019s amazing what a little flour, sugar and butter can create. Pull from your family\u2019s traditional recipes, or try for something unique and daring to suit the person\u2019s preferences. Delicate or heavily-decorated cakes and pies will be difficult to present. These should be stored, packed and transported carefully."

          "description":"Show your love with artisan canned food items, just like grandma used to do. Things like homemade preserves, butters, pickles and cheese have really grown in popularity in recent years. These items are simple to make, tasty and infinitely customizable. Best of all, once they\u2019re sealed they\u2019ll stay fresh for months or even years, so you can prepare them well in advance without having to worry about them going bad. Canning is fairly straightforward, but does require some special equipment. Before you add making old-fashioned canned goods to your to-do list, make sure you have all the necessities: mason jars, canning tools, cookware and natural ingredients. These types of condiments are versatile, which means the recipient is free to use them however they like."

This could take the form of peppermint bark, yogurt pretzels, candy apples or a sweet and savory nut brittle. These foods tend to keep better than others, but chances are they won\u2019t last long anyway. Candies and sweets are real crowd pleasers, especially around the holidays. Hand out small bags of white-chocolate frosted Chex mix or caramel corn, or send them straight through the mail."

Strengthening a personal connection is one of the most meaningful gifts you can give someone. Throw a dinner party to celebrate a special occasion or as a token of appreciation."
