By bending your arms and legs you can create interesting lines that draw the viewer of a photograph directly into you. If your background is busy the focus will be on you, and if it is simple, lines will create complexity. Practice with many poses; bend your arm and place a hand on your hip while your other arm hangs naturally by your side; bend one arm upwards so that your hand is holding your shoulder; place both hands on your hip with one shoulder raised and the other lowered; place both arms behind your back, elbows out, with one shoulder raised; or pull your elbows in, place your hands on the lower back, arch your back with one leg bent and the other elongated in front of the other (this pose is great for a silhouette shot! )."
