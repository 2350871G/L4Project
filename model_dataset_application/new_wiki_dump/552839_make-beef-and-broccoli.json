          "headline":"Slice 1 lb (450 g) of flank steak thinly across the grain.",
          "description":"Place the steak on a cutting board, then carefully use a sharp knife to trim away any fat. Once it\u2019s trimmed, slice the steak into thin strips horizontally across the grain. If you\u2019re not sure which way the grain runs, hold the steak under a light and look for thin lines running all in the same direction. Cutting against the grain results in a much more tender bite of beef. If you\u2019re having trouble getting thin slices of beef, put the steak in the freezer for about 30 minutes. This will firm it up, making it easier to cut."

          "headline":"Mix soy sauce, cornstarch, sherry, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger in a bowl.",
          "description":"For the sauce, combine \u20442 cup (120 mL) soy sauce, 2 tbsp (25 g) cornstarch, 3 US tbsp (44 mL) cooking sherry, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tbsp (7.5 g) of minced ginger  and 2 tbsp (25 g) brown sugar. Stir these ingredients until they\u2019re thoroughly combined and the sugar is dissolved."

          "headline":"Pour half of the mixture over the sliced beef.",
          "description":"Use your hands to stir the sauce into the beef so it's fully coated. This will help you create a more flavorful dish than if you just cooked the steak on its own. If you have time, marinate the steak in the fridge for about 30 minutes. However, if you're trying to get dinner together in a hurry, it's fine to skip the marinating time."

          "headline":"Heat a third of the vegetable oil in a 12 in (30 cm) skillet.",
          "description":"Measure out about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of vegetable oil and pour it into your skillet, then heat it for about 3 minutes on medium-high heat. Don't get the oil so hot that it starts smoking, though, or it could leave a burnt taste on your food. Since the food will be cooking on medium-high heat, it's best to use an oil with a high smoke point, like vegetable or canola oil. Avoid using an oil with a low smoking point, like olive or soybean oil.Tip: If you\u2019re planning on serving rice with your beef and broccoli, start cooking the rice at the same time as the beef. That way, everything will be ready at about the same time!"

        {
          "headline":"Add 1/2 of the beef to the skillet.",
          "description":"By cooking the meat in batches, you ensure you don't crowd the pan. Putting too much food in the skillet at once can drop the temperature, and if the pieces of beef are touching or overlapping, they might not cook all the way through."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cook the beef 1-3 minutes for each side, then transfer to a plate.",

After about 3 minutes, flip the steak over with tongs and cook the pieces on the other side as well. When the steak is completely browned and cooked all the way through, place it on a clean plate while you cook the second batch. Smaller pieces of meat might cook in 2 minutes, while larger pieces might need the full 3 minutes. If you're not sure, take one of the larger pieces out of the skillet and cut it in half. If it's brown all the way through, it's fully cooked. If you stir the meat too much, it won\u2019t brown properly. You\u2019ll be adding the beef back to the hot skillet later, so don\u2019t worry if it gets cool for now."

Give the new oil about a minute to heat up, then add the second batch of steak, cooking it for 1-3 minutes on each side. After the second batch of beef is finished cooking, use your tongs to transfer it to the same plate as the first batch."

Cook the broccoli for about 4-5 minutes, or until the florets are bright green and tender. Frozen broccoli will have a softer texture and may not be ideal for this meal. Transfer the broccoli to the plate with the beef when it\u2019s finished cooking."
        },

          "headline":"Cook the remaining sauce, beef broth, and oyster sauce for 2-3 minutes.",

Then, add \u20444 cup (59 mL) of beef broth and \u20444 cup (59 mL) of oyster sauce to the pan. Cook the sauce over high heat for 2-3 minutes or until it starts to thicken up, stirring frequently. Oyster sauce is a condiment that you can usually find in the ethnic food section of your local grocery store. Substitute hoisin sauce if you can't find oyster sauce. It isn't exactly the same, but it will still produce a delicious dish."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Return the beef and broccoli to the skillet and toss them in the sauce.",
          "description":"Cook the mixture for about another 3 minutes, or until the beef and broccoli are heated through. If the sauce starts to stick to the bottom of the skillet, turn the heat back down to medium or medium-high. Once the dish has finished cooking, use a spoon to sample the sauce, but be careful since it will be very hot! If you need to, add a little salt to your taste preference. Since the soy sauce and oyster sauce both contain salt, you may be happy with the salt level as-is."

          "headline":"Serve the beef and broccoli over rice.",
          "description":"The rice should be finished cooking about the same time as the rest of the meal, although you may want to check it to make sure all the liquid is absorbed. When it\u2019s ready, place a serving of rice onto your plate, then top it with about 1/4 of the beef and broccoli mixture. This meal makes 4 servings. If you have any leftovers, let them cool to room temperature, then put them in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days. If you think it will be longer than that before you eat the remaining food, place the container in the freezer instead. It will keep there for 2-3 months."

If you see lines that are all running in the same direction, that\u2019s the grain. Cut horizontally across these lines to break up the fibers.
