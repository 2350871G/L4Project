Making the Pie Crust Get your equipment. To make a basic pie crust, you will need a food processor, a rolling pin, a knife to cut the butter, plastic wrap, extra flour for dusting, and a 9-inch pie plate. You can use two forks or a pastry cutter if you don\u2019t have a food processor. Chill your butter. When making pastries, it\u2019s always important to use cold butter, because this will create air pockets that make the crust light and flakey. Cut your butter into half-inch (1.3-cm) cubes and chill them in the freezer for at least an hour. The butter can be chilled or even frozen when you make pastry, and that\u2019s why you should cut it into cubes before chilling. Combine the dry ingredients and butter. Pour the flour and salt into the food processor and pulse it a few times to combine them. Then add the butter and continue pulsing the mixture until you have pea-sized clumps of butter. To do this without a food processor, use the two forks simultaneously or the pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour until you have pea-sized bits. Add the ice water. Pour this into the mixture one tablespoon (15 ml) at a time. Continue pulsing until each tablespoon has been worked in, and then add another if necessary.

You can also keep the dough in the fridge for up to two days, or freeze it for later use. Roll the dough. When the dough has had time to chill, remove it from the fridge and unwrap it.

Make the pie shell. Gently pick up the dough and transfer it to the pie plate. Center the dough over the plate and place it down. Gently press the dough to mold it to the pie plate.

You can make the pie crust slightly more decorative by pressing the tines of a fork into the edges around the entire circumference of the pie shell.
