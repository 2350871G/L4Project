There are 12% boost pickups around the field (they are located in circles: one circle in the middle of the field, and another bigger circle surrounding the first one). There are two vertical rows of boost pickup, one at the left of the field and one on the other side. These pickups count for 100% boost. Boost the car as much as possible. Don't worry if boost is empty, pickups are there to pick up. Get familiar with the boost pickups positions, and pick up as many boost pickups as possible. This will keep the RC car more active in the game, obtaining more chances of controlling the game, passing, and scoring goals."

Make sure passes are made regularly, especially from the left and right sides of the field. Most common move in Rocket League is waiting for the ball to kick it in the back of the net, so passes from the side enable the teammate to score a goal easier."

It's a great option for trying to shoot the ball in the goal, or making a save. Only use it at the first hit, then try to control the ball. Don't use it all the time. Remember, other players try to hit the ball as well. If this combo is used regularly, ball can be easily lost.

The handbrake actually does provide a tactical advantage, and learning how to use it will prove invaluable to efficiently moving around any arena. Because your default turning speed will send you around a large radius before you can actually turn, it often means you'll be struggling more than you should to reposition yourself quickly after a botched shot. However, if you use the handbrake and powerslide you can spin the car around in a second, instantly getting you back into the action without missing a beat. With a quick tap of the accelerator while braking you can reposition yourself on the spot, negating the need for that long u-turn you'd be forced to do otherwise. More than that though, the powerslide is perfect for lining up shots without losing possession of the ball, as a quick handbrake turn can always get you into a better position."

Use Jump and \u2193 (slightly down so that the RC car's face is in an upwards position on the air) while accelerating, then boost the car to make an aerial. To make it successful, the ball has to be visualized in a straight line, either straight or diagonally. Aerials have to be set up in mind first, and then performing them. It will then be much easier to aerial the ball."

Although it's a small change, knowing which camera to use to in the right situation can make or break a game. If you're on the goal-line and you're not locked onto the ball for instance, there's simply no way you're going to manage that epic save."
