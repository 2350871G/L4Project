Use a multimeter to test the continuity of the appliances various components. These include the door switches, the defrost heater and timer, and the evaporator fan. If any of these parts fail, they could be your problem. Diagnosing a Refrigerator That Keeps Running Wait a day to see if the problem solves itself. Several factors could cause your refrigerator to temporarily run continuously. If you live in a humid environment, just loaded the refrigerator, or recently adjusted its temperature, it might take a while for the refrigerator to cool completely. It could take 24 hours or possibly more for it to cool. Defrost the freezer in case there's too much ice built up and clean your condenser coils. If there is a build of debris on your condenser coils, they won't be able to efficiently dissipate heat, and the refrigerator will have to constantly cool. If the defroster is faulty, then the evaporator coils will frost over, and the refrigerator will work harder to keep cool. Test the door seal. The door of your refrigerator has a seal that prevents cool air from leaking out. If the seal is faulty, your refrigerator will have to constantly cool itself.
