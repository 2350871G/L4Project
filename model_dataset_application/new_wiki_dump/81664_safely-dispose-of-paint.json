It won't be the exact color you need, but it's useful to use as a base paint or to paint interior surfaces that won't be seen. This way, you can use up all the paint without needing to throw it away. Tightly seal the used paint can and store it upside-down in a cool, dry storage area. Make sure the stored paint is out of reach of children and pets. If you want to use the exact same color again, make sure to write the paint formula down in permanent marker on the paint can lid."

Latex paint is not considered toxic waste, so it doesn't have to be taken to a toxic waste site. Never pour paint into a drain. It can damage your pipes and it isn't good for the water supply. Don't pour paint into the ground. This is hazardous to the soil. If you need to get rid of a lot of latex paint you may want to consider purchasing waste paint hardener. A cup or so of this powder mixed in with a gallon of paint will cause it to harden up within hours."
