          "description":"You can host the party indoors at your home if you plan to have a smaller guest list of around 20-30 people. If you plan to invite more than 50 people, you may want to consider renting an indoor venue, such as a jazz club, a restaurant, or a community hall. You may go for an indoor venue if the weather is going to be unpredictable or too cold for your guests on the day of the party."

          "headline":"Go for an outdoor venue based on the weather.",
          "description":"If you know you are going to have good weather for the party, consider an outdoor venue like your backyard or a park. Outdoor venues were popular in the 1920s. You can also rent out the patio at a local restaurant or an outdoor garden. It may be fun to find an outdoor venue where you can put up white tents so guests can enjoy the weather without being directly in the sun or the elements all party long."

          "headline":"Schedule the party for the evening.",
          "description":"A Great Gatsby party will be the most atmospheric at night. Parties in the 1920s were often scheduled late at night, going until the early morning. Make the start time for the party in the evening, such as 8 o\u2019clock or 9 o\u2019clock. Expect guests to arrive fashionably late. Having the party later at night will also give you time to prepare for the party that day."
