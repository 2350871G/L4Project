  "text":" Preheating and Prepping Preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and line a large baking sheet with a sheet of wax paper.  Line a second baking sheet with wax paper and place a wire rack on it. This will be used later on in the cooling process so you can set it aside for now. Making the Batter Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer in a medium mixing bowl. You'll want to beat them for about 4 minutes, or until stiff peaks form. Beat in the almond extract, sugar and salt.  Fold in the coconut using a rubber spatula. It's important to switch from using the mixer to using a rubber spatula because you want to ensure that the air you whipped into the mixed thus far doesn't get beaten out at this point. Since the coconut has rough edges and it's heavier than the egg whites, beating it into the mixture will collapse the stiff peaks you've formed. Instead, gently folding it in with a spatula ensures that the mixture doesn't deflate quickly. Baking and Cooling Scoop balls of mixture onto the baking sheet with an ice cream scoop. If you don't have an ice cream scoop, you could use a metal tablespoon. Make sure that you space each dollop about 1\" apart. Place the baking sheet on the center rack in your oven and bake the macaroons for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove them from the oven when they're done and carefully transfer each one onto the wire rack.  Prepare the Chocolate Drizzle and Decorate Put the chocolate chips into microwave-safe bowl and microwave them on medium heat for 30 seconds.  Stir the chocolate with a small spoon to help mix the melted parts with the solid chips.  Repeat the heating at 30-seconds intervals until the chocolate is completely melted.  Using a small spoon, drizzle your melted chocolate over the tops of the cooled macaroons.
