          "headline":"Try a simple oil and garlic dressing.",
          "description":"This is a delicious, comforting, and easy way to serve up pasta. As you're cooking the noodles, simmer about \u20442 cup (120 mL) of extra virgin olive oil, 3 minced garlic cloves, and 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of salt in a skillet over low heat. Stir the mixture occasionally and cook for about 8 minutes, or until the garlic becomes soft and takes on a golden color. Add the cooked pasta and about \u20444 cup (59 mL) of the cooking water to the olive oil and mix well. If you want your pasta to be a little spicier, you can also simmer a pinch of red pepper flakes in the oil along with the garlic."

          "headline":"Add a splash of lemon for extra zing.",
          "description":"Squeeze a little lemon juice onto your pasta to add a bit of refreshing tartness. Lemon goes especially well with dressings made with garlic and olive oil or butter. If you prefer, you can add some lemon zest instead. Zest about half a lemon and mix the zest in with the cooked pasta before serving."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Sprinkle on some parmesan cheese.",
          "description":"Parmesan is a classic addition that goes well with just about any pasta dish. Sprinkle it on top of pasta in a simple butter or olive oil dressing, or use it to add extra dimension to a marinara, alfredo, or pesto sauce. Fresh parmesan cheese is more flavorful than the popular pre-grated or powdered varieties. Buy a block of parmesan from your grocery store deli and grate it directly over your freshly-cooked pasta. There's no specific guideline for how much cheese to add to your pasta. Some people like just a sprinkling, and others prefer to pour it on. Try aiming for about \u00bc of a cup (35g) of cheese per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of pasta and adjust to taste from there."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Experiment with other seasonings.",
          "description":"Pasta is a versatile dish, so it can go well with just about any savory seasoning. Try making a simple buttered pasta and adding classic Italian spices like oregano, parsley, basil, rosemary, or sage. You can also experiment with seasonings like turmeric, cumin, or even cardamom. Don't feel constrained to savory spices. If you're feeling daring, you can try frying up some cooked pasta with butter, fresh parmesan, and a pinch of fresh nutmeg. The amount of seasoning you need will depend on your taste and the type of seasoning you are using. For strongly flavored or spicy seasonings, such as basil or red chile pepper flakes, try starting with 1 teaspoon (about half a gram to 1.5 g, depending on the spice) per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of pasta and adding more to taste. For a milder seasoning, like parsley, try starting with 2 tablespoons (about 0.8 g) per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of pasta."

You can try adding things like:\nA few spoonfuls of fresh, minced herbs, such as rosemary, sage, basil, or parsley. Soft pureed herbs will also impart a nice, bold color to the finished dough. 1 or 2 roasted and pureed red bell peppers.

You can also flatten the pasta with a rolling pin and cut it into strips by hand. Once your pasta is made, you can either cook it right away or save it for later. You can air-dry your pasta on a coat hanger or clothes drying rack overnight, or freeze it on a baking sheet and then store it in freezer-safe containers until you're ready to cook it."
