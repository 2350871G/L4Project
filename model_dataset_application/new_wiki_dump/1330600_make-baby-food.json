          "description":"Produce is at its most nutritious and flavorful when it's perfectly ripe. Since you won't be adding sugar and salt to the food, it's important to choose ripe produce - otherwise, it will taste bland. Look for produce that is brightly colored and ripe without being too soft or bruised. Follow individual guides for each type of fruit and vegetable to determine when specific items are ripe. Farmer's markets are great places to find fresh produce at its peak, since they tend to stock only fruits and vegetables that are in season. You can use frozen or canned fruits and vegetables, but it's better to use fresh whenever possible. Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables often have additives to help preserve them. Read the label carefully if you decide to buy frozen or canned vegetables."

If possible, shop in the organic section of your supermarket so you can be sure the food you make for your baby is chemical-free. Some fruits and vegetables are more apt to become contaminated by fruits and vegetables than others. For example, apples are treated with more pesticides than any other produce, so you may want to go out of your way to buy organic apples. Avocados, on the other hand, aren't treated with as many pesticides. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e6\\/Make-Baby-Food-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Make-Baby-Food-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e6\\/Make-Baby-Food-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Make-Baby-Food-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
