These people work with children in an educational setting on a daily basis. They should be able to help with ideas of games to play with the child or, at the least, ideas of where to look for games. Teachers have resources that are not readily available to parents. Parents can ask the teacher if the childcare facility has a resource room for parents. Ask if there are books or resources that can be borrowed overnight or over a weekend."

Find books that are for teachers of toddlers and preschoolers. Find books that specifically reference learning games for toddlers in the titles. When you have the books, check the Table of Contents in the front or the Index in the back. Look for games about the specific topics the child likes. If the child likes math, look for counting games. If the child likes building, look for games that incorporate that skill. If the books have something useable, check it out and take it home. Go through it more thoroughly to get the details about the games. Then play some of the games with the toddler."
