Generally, you will need to remove the lint screen to open the dryer. Pull out the lint screen. Then, use a screw driver to unscrew the lint screen housing panel that the lint screen fits into. After the screws are removed, pull out the housing panel. Always unplug the dryer before opening it up. Remove the top. Place putty knives under the left and right side of the top panel of the dryer. Lift simultaneously on both ends to pick up the cabinet top. Move it out of the way. Unlock the door switch harness. Once you open the top of the dryer, you should be able to find a pair of wires connecting to the door. There should be a locking mechanism where two large plugs connect wires in the control panel to the wires in the door. Disconnect these two parts of the locking mechanism. You might need to insert a slot screwdriver between the two plugs to release the locking mechanism. Remove the lid switch. There should be two screws on either side of the lid switch, inside the door. Use a screw driver to unscrew these and pull out the lid switch. Replace the lid switch.
