  "text":" Prepare the Vegetables Wash the outside of the vegetable under cool running water.  Place the vegetable on your cutting board and slice off the stems. You should remove no more than 1/4\u201d (6 millimeters) from the flesh of the vegetable on either side. Place your knife on top of the vegetable near the base and slice downward at a 90-degree angle to the cutting board. This will create a thin slice. Continue slicing the vegetable into thin, round pieces. Make sure that they are all similar in size since they\u2019ll be cooking at the same time. Do not slice your vegetable pieces thicker than 1/4\u201d (6 millimeters). Place your sliced vegetables on a large plate until you are ready to use them again.  Set up a Seasoning and Frying Station Combine the cornmeal, flour, salt and pepper. Sift the ingredients together over a large, shallow bowl. The generous helping of salt and pepper is necessary to season the batter. Place the bowl of dry ingredients on the counter adjacent to the stovetop.  Combine the eggs and milk in a large bowl, beating them together until they are well combined using a fork or a whisk.  Place the bowl containing the egg mixture to the left or right of the dry ingredients bowl.  Place the plate of sliced vegetables next to the bowl containing the egg mixture on the side opposite the dry ingredients. You will dip the vegetables in the egg mixture, roll them in the dry ingredients and drop them directly into your hot cooking oil. Battering and Frying Large Seasoned Vegetables Heat peanut or canola oil in a large, deep pan on your stovetop until it is 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 C). Pour enough canola oil to ensure that the oil is 2 to 3\u201d (5 to 8 centimeters) deep in your pan. Dip one sliced vegetable into the egg mixture with your hands. Turn the slice until it is well coated. Dredge the vegetable in the dry ingredients. Roll the vegetable slice in the dry mixture until the vegetable slice is completely covered in batter. Drop the vegetable into the hot oil using tongs.  Fry the vegetables in small batches. If you crowd the pan, then the vegetables will not brown. Place the fried vegetables on a plate that has been covered with 2 to 3 paper towels. The paper towels will absorb the excess grease from the vegetables so that they stay crisper. Repeat the process until all of the vegetables are battered and fried. When the vegetables are browned and floating on top of the hot oil, you will know that they are done. Battering and Frying Small Seasoned Vegetables Add all of your chopped okra to the egg mixture and stir the okra until they are completely coated.  Transfer the coated okra into the dry mixture bowl. Toss the okra in the dry mixture with your hands until the vegetables are covered in batter. Place the okra on a metal slotted spoon or a stainless steel mesh strainer. Drop the strainer into the oil and turn it to deposit the okra in the pan. Fry the okra in small batches. Be careful not to crowd the pan, or your okra will not brown evenly. Remove the okra from the pan using the slotted metal spoon or the stainless steel mesh strainer.  Place the fried okra onto a plate that has been covered with 2 to 3 paper towels. The paper towels will absorb the excess grease. Repeat the process until all of the okra is battered and fried. You will know that the okra is done when it has turned golden brown and is floating on top of the hot oil.",
