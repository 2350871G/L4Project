If a new player asks how to play Mao, you have to tell them it's a frustrating card game and that you can't tell them the rules; they have to find out the specifics themselves.

The dealer has a special role in Mao. He or she has the authority to initiate the game, choose what rules to use, judge and resolve disputes, and deal with any unusual complications that might arise.

Some groups prefer to have a second player who also knows the rules so that the two of them can call penalties on each other. The dealer deals several cards to each player. 5 to 8 cards per player is typical, but the exact amount doesn't matter as long as everyone gets the same number.
