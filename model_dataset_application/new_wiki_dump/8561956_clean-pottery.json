Apply suction as you brush the object\u2019s surface with a soft paintbrush. If possible, use a vacuum cleaner that has a high-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) and modifiable suction. Use less suction for tiny or very delicate items."

Wipe the wet cloth over stains, grease or dirt build-up. Perform this step on stubborn stains before proceeding to soak the item in soap and water. Ammonia can cause a chemical reaction to surfaces with unstable glazing. If in doubt, don\u2019t use ammonia. Make sure to wear gloves!"
