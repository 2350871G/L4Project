Matte finishes are very durable and tend to conceal imperfections and smears, making them ideal for areas prone to damage. Matte finishes hold up well under humidity and can be scrubbed clean, making them a great choice for the kitchen."

          "description":"Matte paints work well if you want darker, bolder colors. Glossier paints can make bold shades, like bright reds, look overwhelming, but the played down look of matte works well with such colors. Darker colors turn out great with matte paint as well. Try matte paints in deep blacks, purples, and blues ."

          "description":"Matte paint can be used to create stripes on a wall. You can either use two different shades of matte to make stripes over a wall. You can also use the same shade, but use a matte paint with a semi-gloss paint. This will create an illusion of stripes, as the stripes will be marked by texture rather than color.If you want a very dramatic look, try varying the finish and the color. For example, try black and white stripes. Paint the white stripes in a semi-gloss paint and paint the black ones with a matte finish."

Then, use a roller to paint the walls by rolling the paint on line by line, following the pattern on your wall. Run the roller all the way up to the ceiling. When dipping your brush, only dunk it about a quarter of an inch into the paint. Then, swipe any excess paint off the brush using the sides of your paint can. Make sure there's enough paint on your rollers that paint is applied easily, without a patchy or faint look. However, do not glob paint onto your rollers. If your rollers are dripping with paint, you're using too much. Back roll the roller to ensure even coverage."
