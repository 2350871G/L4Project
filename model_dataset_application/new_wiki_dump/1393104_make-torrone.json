  "text":" Prepare a large, clean working surface to use for making the torrone. Lightly dust the area with cornstarch. Line the bottom of a 9 by 13 inch (228.6 mm by 330.2 mm) baking dish with edible wafer paper. Put the baking dish aside. Place 3 cups of whole blanched almonds (680.4 g) on a large rimmed baking sheet. Bake the almonds at 350 degrees (176.66 C) for 10 to 12 minutes until golden brown and allow to cool. Put 1/4 tsp. kosher salt (1.19 g) and 3 large egg whites into a large mixing bowl attached to an electric mixer that has been fitted with a whisk. Set the mixture aside. Put 3 cups sugar (680.4 g) and 1 cup clover honey (237 ml) in a heavy 4 qt. (3.784 l) saucepan that has a candy thermometer attached. Heat the mixture over a medium heat, stirring often, until it starts to simmer and the sugar is almost completely dissolved. Watch the sugar and honey mixture as it continues to cook, stirring it to prevent any sticking. It should take approximately 15 minutes for the mixture to reach the desired range of 315 degrees (157.22 C). You will know that it is done when the mixture darkens in color and begins to foam. Beat the mixture of egg whites and kosher salt within the mixing bowl attached to the electric mixer until firm peaks form. Do this while the honey and sugar mixture is still cooking. Add 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar (113.4 g) to the mixing bowl and continue to beat the mixture for about 1 minute. Turn off the electric mixer and put the bowl aside. Continue to monitor the sugar and honey mixture that is cooking. When it reaches the desired temperature of 315 degrees (157.22 C), remove the pan from the heat. Stir the candy mixture for about 1 to 2 minutes to allow it to cool. Pour the sugar and honey mixture slowly into the mixing bowl, combining everything with the electric mixer. Beat the mixture for about 5 minutes until it becomes lighter in color. Add 1 tsp. vanilla extract (5 ml) and finely grated zest of 1 large orange to the mixing bowl, beating for an additional minute. Fold in the almonds, stirring the mixture (which will be sticky in texture.) Use your prepared working surface to form the finished torrone candy. Dust your hands with cornstarch several times as you are working with it so that it does not get too sticky. Place the torrone candy on the work surface and knead it for 5 to 6 turns. Put the candy into the prepared 9 by 13 inch (228.6 mm by 330.2 mm) baking dish that has been lined with the edible wafer paper, pressing and flattening it to completely fill the pan. Lay the 2nd layer of edible wafer paper on top of the torrone candy, pressing down lightly. Put the baking dish on a cooling rack for approximately 1 hour to allow the torrone candy to thoroughly cool. Cut the torrone into individual pieces. Store the torrone candy within a sealed container, layering it between waxed paper at room temperature. Allow it to dry for a minimum of 8 hours. The torrone candy will keep fresh for up to 3 weeks.
