  "text":" Place aluminum foil in and around two 9-inch cake pans. Be sure that a little foil extends over the edges. This portion will help you pull out the cakes easier at the end. Get a little vegetable cooking spray and shoot a light film on the foil. Look at the back of your brownie mix package and preheat your oven to the directions. Different mixes may have different temperatures. Make the batter for the brownie mix. Split the batter in half to the two pans; be sure that it's evenly divided. Also, divide both the nuts and M&Ms to the two pans. Place the two pans in the oven for about 23 to 25 minutes, or until the edges of the cake has moved away from the pan's edge.  Remove from the oven and place it on the side for cooling. Use the \"extra\" foil to lift up the cakes from the pans. Flip one of the cakes upside-down (with the toppings on the bottom). Evenly spread the ice cream on top of this \"layer\". Spread the ice cream topping on top of the ice cream. Carefully, place the second cake on top of this, but toppings face up (the nuts and M&Ms). Press down lightly. Place Saran wrap around the brownie cake and place it in the freezer. Take it out of the freezer when it's firm and serve 15 minutes afterwards. Finished. ",
