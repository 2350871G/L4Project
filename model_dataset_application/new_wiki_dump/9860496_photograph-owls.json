This will help you determine where and at what time to pick your spot. If you don't know the specific type of owl you're aiming to photograph, research what types of owls tend to live in your area."

          "description":"National parks, shorelines, popular hiking trails, and other natural public areas are great for photographing owls. These owls are much more accustomed to being near humans, making it easier to photograph them, and you won\u2019t be trespassing on private land. Make sure you stay on marked trails."

          "headline":"Wear comfortable, neutral-colored clothing.",
          "description":"While this isn\u2019t a rule you have to live by, it\u2019s always better to make yourself blend in when bird watching as opposed to standing out. Avoid super bright colors like yellow, orange, and red and dress in more neutral tones. Wearing a wide-brimmed hat will help shield your eyes and face from the owls, as well as the sun. It\u2019s best to dress in layers so that you can easily stay cool or warm depending on the temperature."

          "headline":"Listen for the sounds of an owl to choose your spot.",
          "description":"Owls are often heard before they\u2019re seen, so listen for a \u201choo hoo\" or other owl call to help you identify the location of the owl. Once you hear one, you can use your binoculars to try to spot it. The sound an owl makes will depend on the type of owl, so do some research beforehand to learn the individual sounds the owl might make so that you\u2019ll recognize them. Looking for owl pellets, or the regurgitated leftovers from their food, is also a good way to know when an owl is nearby."

          "description":"Once you\u2019ve spotted the owl or you know that it will be in one spot, sit down and prepare to wait. You may be sitting for hours at a time, so bring a towel, pad, or small chair with you. Sitting low to the ground will help the owls feel less threatened by you and you\u2019ll blend in better. If you don\u2019t have a chair, make use of a tree stump or other natural resting spot."

You don\u2019t want to be getting to your spot when the owl is awake and going about its business\u2014this is the time when you\u2019ll want to be taking pictures. If you're hoping to photograph a specific type of owl, do some research to find out what time of day they're most active."

          "description":"Getting too close to the owls will scare them and disturb their natural surroundings. If you notice the owl staring at you and looking distressed, it\u2019s time to back up. You can try becoming part of the landscape to see if the owls will get used to your presence. Position yourself far away the first day, and then very slowly move closer each day after that. Invest in binoculars or long camera lenses to capture the photos at a greater distance. How far away you stay from the owls will differ\u2014you might need to stay 20 yards (18 m) away, or 100 yards (91 m) away\u2014it all depends on the specific type of owl."
