While you most likely will not eat these foods alone, they are all good for extending other meals. Store flour, rice, oatmeal, and the like in airtight (and bug-tight) canisters or jars. If you don't have dedicated canisters yet, you can save large jars from items you buy."

      "description":"Frozen meats are very convenient, especially if you have a microwave in which to defrost them. (Otherwise, defrost in the fridge a day in advance.) Frozen vegetables may not be quite as good as fresh ones, but you may find that they are easier to keep on hand than fresh. If you love smoothies, you might consider getting frozen fruit, too, or freezing your own fruit. You can also learn how to freeze cooked foods and ready-to-cook foods for yourself, for quick meals later."

    {
      "headline":"Start to build a selection of seasonings, according to what you use.",
      "description":"These are herbs and spices, as well as the ubiquitous salt and pepper, and include condiments like soy sauce, ketchup, and vinegar. Seasonings add flavors to your cooking. Some can be fairly expensive, so start with one jar of spices at a time. You don't need every spice; just the ones you use. Find out what your recipes call for and just buy that. Look for a few seasoning mixes, or mix your own. Italian seasoning is generally just a mix of oregano, basil, rosemary and parsley. A jar of chili powder or taco seasoning can dress up some basic meat and veggies so they'll taste good in a tortilla. Do watch for added salt in seasoning mixes, though. Some grocery and health food stores may provide samples of spice mixes for free. This is a good opportunity to get a sample package or two spice mixes. Look around for a source of spices in bulk or in packets, rather than in little, glass jars. You may want to buy spices the first time in those glass jars, but refill them with spices in less expensive packaging."
