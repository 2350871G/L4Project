          "description":"No matter what you're doing in the summer heat, you'll be happier if you're wearing clothes that keep you as cool as possible. Your clothes can play a big role in how hot you feel, so take a moment to consider your outfit before you leave the house in the summer. A good summer outfit:\nIs made from mostly breathable fabrics like cotton, linen, or artificial fabrics that \"wick\" sweat away from the skin. Uses mostly light colors like white and light blue, which absorb less heat from the sun. Is fairly loose-fitting, allowing air to flow next to the skin. Shorts, dresses, flowing gowns, and looser shirts work well. Doesn't leave much naked skin exposed to the sun. Especially important for people vulnerable to sunburn."

          "headline":"Stay hydrated with cool drinks.",
          "description":"While it's always important to stay hydrated, your water intake needs special attention in the summer. Getting plenty to drink when you're in the sun won't just make you feel cooler \u2014 it's also important for your heart and muscles. Try keeping a bottle of water with a few ice cubes in it with you whenever you go out in the summer so that you'll always have something to drink. When it comes to hydration, plain old water is usually the best choice. If you're exercising extra hard in the summer heat for longer than about an hour, a sports drink (e.g., Gatorade, etc.) can give you a boost of carbohydrates and electrolytes. However, these drinks tend to contain lots of sugar, so balance your consumption with your daily nutrition needs."

          "headline":"Make a cold compress.",
          "description":"If you need to cool off right away, it's nice to have a cold compress handy. A cold compress is just something cold that you can hold against your skin to lower your temperature. There are many different ways to make one \u2014 see our article on cold compresses for a few different ideas. Below is just one easy recipe:\nTake a clean rag or sock and soak it in water from the sink. Wring it out to remove excess water so that it is still damp. Place it in a plastic bag in the freezer. After a few hours, take the compress out and lay it across the back of your neck. It should quickly have you feeling cooler. Re-soak it and return it to the freezer when you're done."

          "headline":"Limit your exercise.",
          "description":"The more you move, the more heat your body generates. If your goal is staying cool, try not to use your muscles more than you need to. Walk around your neighborhood instead of running, coast on your bicycle instead of pumping your pedals, or simply consider driving if it's an option. Most important of all, take plenty of breaks. Resting allows your body to dissipate some of the heat you've built up from exercising."

          "description":"One of the ways the body cools off is by letting heat transfer from the skin into the air around it. If the air is moving quicker, more heat can transfer and the body can cool off quicker. You can't control how hot it is outside or whether there's a breeze, but if you have a fan, you can keep things cooler in your house. The faster the air moves, the cooler you'll feel, so higher speeds have more of a cooling effect. Ceiling fans are great for circulating the air in an entire room. You'll want most fans to run counter-clockwise in the summer. This pushes the air downward onto you, creating a minor \"windchill\" effect. If you don't have a ceiling fan, smaller desktop fans work well. Point them at your face for constant comfort or set them on a rotating cycle to circulate the air in the room."

          "description":"Warm air tends to rise. This means that when it's hot, the highest part of your house will tend to have the hottest air. If your house has more than one story, you can use this fact to your advantage by creating a cooling air current in your house. See below for directions:\nWhen you leave the house during the day, keep the windows closed and curtains drawn. Warm air will naturally rise to the top floors of your house and get trapped. When you get home in the evening, open a window on the top floor. Point a fan (large box fans are best) so that it blows air out of this window. Open a few windows on the bottom floor of your house. Keep the doors inside your house open. The fan will blow the hot air out of the top floor, sending it outside. Cool evening air will flow through the lower windows and rush upward to replace it, creating a pleasant breeze."

If you live in an area with dry weather, try putting a little moisture in the air by soaking a towel and hanging it in front of an open window. Open all the windows on the same floor to start a draft that will carry moisture in and cool you. You can also get the same effect by hanging a wet towel across a fan."

Luckily, a device called a dehumidifier can pull the moisture out of the air, making it easier for your body to cool itself. Dehumidifiers are available from hardware stores in a wide variety of sizes and prices. Most commercial air conditioners also remove humidity from the air."
