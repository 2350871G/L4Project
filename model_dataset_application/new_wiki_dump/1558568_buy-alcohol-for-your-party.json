          "description":"Before you can think about who to invite and how much alcohol to buy, it\u2019s important to set a budget for your party. This can help you not overspend and guide you what types of alcohol may be best for your party. Let how much money you want to spend overall guide you. For example, if you can spend $150, you may want half to go to alcohol and the other half to food. However, if you\u2019re having friends over for a wine tasting, you may want to spend more on a few bottles of quality wine and offer 2-3 small appetizers. Consider whether you are going to ask guests to bring a bottle of wine, beer, or another spirit. This will allow you to focus on a couple of types of alcohol. Figure out what you want to offer at the party. If you\u2019re having alcohol, chances are that you may want to offer snacks or other food like pizza or burgers."

          "description":"The larger the party you throw, the more alcohol you'll need to supply. However, different types of parties will require different amounts of alcohol. For example, a simple lunch party won't require as much alcohol as a cocktail party or a wedding reception. Decide how long the party will last. The longer your party is, the more alcohol you'll need to supply to your guests. A good rule of thumb for parties is to provide enough alcohol so that each guest has 2 drinks for the first hour of the party, followed by 1 drink for every additional hour of the party."

          "description":"If you\u2019re having a formal or slightly formal party, you\u2019ll need to send out invitations. The list can guide you for the amount and types of alcohol you should get. If it's not a formal, invite-only party, then estimate the number of people that you think may show up. Even a rough figure can help you estimate how much alcohol to buy. Write a note next to each guest\u2019s name to remind yourself how much and what the person drinks. You can categorize guests by \u201clight drinker, average drinker, heavy drinker.\u201d Add a note of \u201cwine,\u201d \u201cliquor,\u201d or \u201cbeer\u201d to help guide you on what specific alcohol and quantities you may need to buy. Make sure to throw away the list before the party so you don\u2019t offend anyone."

          "description":"Once you have your guest list or estimate of how many people will attend and what they will drink, you can put together a shopping list. Make sure to overestimate a bit so that you don\u2019t run out of alcohol during the party. You can always save extra for yourself or the next party. Feel free to play with the ratios of beer, wine, and liquor depending on your audience and occasion. For example, you might want more beer than liquor for a World Cup party. A formal dinner might serve more wine. For a crowd under 35, get more vodka, rum, and beer. Select as wide a variety of alcoholic beverages as you can. If you know for sure that none of your guests will drink a beverage of a certain type, then don\u2019t buy it. Otherwise, try to offer a combination of beer, wine, and several liquors. For reference, a 750-ml bottle of wine has about 5 servings and the same size bottle of liquor will have about 16 drinks. For beer, if you have having a larger group, you may want to get a keg or half keg. If you serve beer in 10-ounce cups, a keg will have about 200 servings and a half-keg 100 servings. For smaller parties, get cans or bottles of beer.

You don't need to include guests under the legal drinking age, but do be sure to have non-alcohol options for them and any other guests who don't drink alcohol."

Cut costs where you can and splurge a bit on something special like a premium liquor or wine. Ask store personnel if they are willing to give you a deal.

For example, things like chicken wings, sliders, and pizza go well with beer. You could do cheese and arugula toasts with herb oil or tomato mozzarella skewers with wine. For liquors, you could do deviled eggs or a guacamole. Consider other options such as soups, tiny sandwiches, fruit squares, cut vegetables and dip, or meats such as salami.
