  "text":" Preparing Preheat oven to 450.  Pour sugar, lemon juice, and water into a small pot.  Heat on the sugar, lemon juice, and water in the pot on medium high for 15 minutes while stirring occasionally. This is how the syrup should look like when complete. Soak the mozzarella cheese in water in medium sized bowl to remove salt for 15 minutes. Make sure to cover the mozzarella with enough water. Water should be an inch over the mozzarella to properly soak. Take the dough out of the box and shred it using a knife.  In a large bowl, mix the shredded dough, orange dye, orange blossom water, and melted butter. The best way to do this is to use clean hands and mix the dough with your fingers. Make sure the dough is evenly coated in the mixture. The dough should be an orangey-yellow color. When thoroughly mixed set the bowl aside and move on to the next step. Assembling Grease the pan using butter and orange dye. First sprinkle the orange powder on to the pan and then mix around with the butter. Place half of the dough mixture from the bowl onto the pan and spread evenly so there is at least a half inch layer of dough throughout the pan. Make sure to pat down mixture so it is compact and even in the pan. Strain the shredded mozzarella cheese using a strainer. Pat down the mozzarella cheese using a paper towel until it is mostly dry. Sprinkle two tablespoons of sugar on top of shredded mozzarella cheese and mix with your hands until the cheese and sugar is mixed together. The easiest way to do this is to pretend you are kneading dough, but instead of dough it is cheese and sugar. Pat down a layer of shredded cheese on top of the first layer of dough. Place fresh mozzarella over the layer of shredded mozzarella and pat down again. Make sure both layers of cheese are even and covering the dough. Place the other half of the dough mixture of the layer of cheese and pat down. Make sure you are covering the cheese completely. Baking and Serving Place the knafeh in the oven and bake for 25 minutes.  Take it out of the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes.  Cut the knafeh in even square slices and serve with the syrup. ",
