You can use as little as 1 \u20444 cups (300 mL) of water. Use 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of salt for every 1 cup (240 mL) of rice. Short grain white rice needs slightly less water.

  "text":" Rinsing Your Rice Pour the rice into a bowl and cover it with cold water. Pick a bowl big enough to hold the rice. Pour water into the bowl, and mix it up with your hands. You can also use a spoon to agitate the water. You should see the water turn cloudy, which is the starch from the rice sloughing off. Strain the rice through a fine metal sieve. Pour the rice into a sieve over the sink. The sieve just needs to be fine enough to keep the rice from falling out. Let the water drain out the bottom. Alternatively, you can simply rinse the rice under running water in the sieve. You'll need to rinse it for about a minute. Repeat the process a couple of times until the water runs clear. Put the rice back in the bowl, and add water again. Agitate the water, and then drain the water off in the sieve. Keep going until the water is clear when you agitate it.
