          "description":"Whether you\u2019re in a home or commercial kitchen, you need to have access to a fire extinguisher. Fire extinguishers do exactly what their name suggests \u2013 they extinguish fires with a chemical foam that prevents fires from obtaining more oxygen. These are an excellent tool and can prevent small fires turning into big fires, but remember, your food won\u2019t be edible after you use an extinguisher. Commercial kitchens will need to follow their city\u2019s code requirements about how many extinguishers are needed and where they should be located. Typically an extinguisher is kept below the kitchen sink in a home kitchen."

At the minimum, your kit should contain plenty of sterile gauze, bandages, a first-aid burn gel, cling wrap (to cover a burn until you can get treatment), and scissors to cut away any clothing that might be touching the burned area. Periodically check your kit to make sure that the contents are still there and that they aren\u2019t expired. Cities will have requirements about what your commercial first-aid kit should contain."

Water heated above this temperature can cause scalding burns, and is an unsafe temperature, especially if there are children in the house. Turning down the temperature on your hot water heater will also save you money. The higher the temperature, the more your water heater has to work to keep the water heated at such a high temperature. Consider installing anti-scald devices on tubs or faucets that children can access."

Baggy or loose clothing can ignite easily because it hangs much closer to heat sources than the rest of your body. While clothing fires aren\u2019t typical, they do account for 18% of fire-related fatalities. If you have long hair, consider keeping a head scarf, hair tie, or hair net in the kitchen to use when you cook. Avoid wearing long or loose sleeved clothing while cooking as well because the sleeves can catch on fire."

Make sure that the sink is empty except for the colander, and very slowly pour the pan away from your body and turn your head away from the steam. If anything splashes out, this will prevent hot water from touching you.

This directs any steam away from you and prevents you from being scalded by hot steam. It is best to do this over the sink. If the lid handle is also hot, use an oven mitt or hot pad so that you don\u2019t burn your hand."

To avoid these painful, and sometimes dangerous, scalding burns, let your hot food or beverage sit for a few minutes to cool down before you ingest them. Also, if you see steam coming from your food or beverage, a good indication that they\u2019re too hot to consume, you can blow on them to cool them down also."

You may forget that a pan is hot, or you may not know that someone recently turned a stove burner off and that it\u2019s still hot. Treat all pans, pots, cookie sheets, and stove burners as hot until you verify that they aren\u2019t. Put empty pans, pots, and baking sheets on empty burners while they cool down. Wrap potholders around hot handles or set them on top of lids, but make sure that you\u2019re not blocking any steam venting holes in the lid when you put the potholder on there. If you need to use your stove but have a pot or pan that needs to cool down at the same time, put your pot or pan on a trivet on the counter.

Remove microwave food lids carefully to avoid being scalded. Always assume that food cooked in the microwave is just as hot as food cooked by conventional methods. Keep the microwave at a good height for you. If something spills, you will be less likely to get burnt if the item is at arm\u2019s length from you. Put a plastic spoon in a cup or other smooth vessels when heating liquid in a microwave. A plastic spoon can prevent the liquid from spattering, preventing possible scalds. Read the bottom of a container to make sure it is safe for the microwave oven before using the container to heat foods or liquids. Use only containers marked, \"Microwave Safe.\" Purchase microwave ovens that turn off automatically when you open the oven door."

If you\u2019re standing too close, the oil can jump on to your arm, hand, face, or clothes. To prevent yourself from being burned, stand a few feet away from a pan or pot that has hot oil in it. And use long tongs when you work with food in the hot oil. If oil or grease catches fire, slide a lid over the pan or pot. This will remove the air that the fire needs to keep burning and put the fire out quickly. Under no circumstances should you ever put water on a grease or oil fire. This will only cause the fire to flare up aggressively. Turn off the burner immediately and avoid throwing anything onto the fire."

This is especially important for any appliance that could heat up and burn your child or turn on and cut your child. Consider wrapping each appliance\u2019s cord up so that it\u2019s not only out of reach, but not easily plugged in should your child try to do so. Another safety tactic is to put a small lock through the cord\u2019s prongs, which will prevent the plug from being inserted into an outlet.

You have to choose which needs your attention more at that moment, your child or the pot on the stove. Unfortunately, when you lift the pot\u2019s lid, steam might rush up and burn the child\u2019s leg, or they might be kicking their feet and accidentally kick the pot or handle to a pan, flipping the hot contents all over both of you.
