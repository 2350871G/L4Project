You may use any combination of shapes you prefer, but make sure each shape is roughly symmetrical vertically. The right and left side of each shape don't have to be exactly the same, but if they are too different your mobile may hang lopsided. You may also choose to make two or more similar mobiles to hang near each other. If you have trouble coming up with something from scratch, search online for printable templates."

If you plan on printing out your designs, you will also need a printer. If you will be drawing them by hand, you will need a pen or pencil, a ruler, and a compass or protractor."

Download a template or design your own shapes using an image editing program. If your printer can print on cardstock, print the shapes directly onto your cardstock. If your printer can't print on cardstock, or you would like to incorporate a detailed color image into your mobile, print the shapes onto normal printer paper instead. Glue or tape the printed image to a piece of cardstock. Draw out your shapes onto the cardstock. Use a ruler and other drawing tools to make sure the shapes are vertically symmetrical. Draw out only one of each shape. Glue or tape other paper products to the cardstock. You may also choose to incorporate existing pictures, stationary, or newspaper clippings into your mobile. To do so, glue or tape the image onto cardstock. Then draw out your shape as described previously."

You will need a string long enough to start at the bottom shape and reach a few feet past the top. The amount of extra string you will need at the top will depend on how low you want your mobile to hang. Keep in mind it's always easier to correct a too-long string than a too-short one."

          "description":"Traditional mobiles consist of rods chained together to form multiple branches. Each rod has either an additional rod or an object hung from both its right and left ends. They rely on equilibrium to keep each rod roughly horizontal and the entire sculpture balanced. When the two ends have equal weight, what is called a balance point is at the exact center of the rod. The balance point is where the tether attaches to that rod from above. If two objects have different weights, the balance point will shift towards the heavier object. Every subsequent branch hung from a parent rod factors into the total weight of that rod's ends. So, if you find that your mobile is lopsided towards one end, try shifting the balance point towards that end. However, if the difference is too great, you will need to add additional weights to the lighter side or remove some from the heavier end."

If your objects are heavy or of unequal weight, you will need to be careful when it comes to placement. Start from what will be the bottom of your mobile and pair the objects accordingly. Then, go up to the next branch and either plan to hang an object or new branch equal in weight to your first from the other end. Keep going until you reach where you want your mobile to begin. If you don't plan on making too many branches, this step is less important."

For objects that have a loop of their own, such as a charm, hook them into the paperclip's wire. For other object types, you may need to unwind a paperclip and wrap the wire around the object for the end of the chain to hook on to. Attach a free chain to the middle paperclip of your top straw.

Light decorations, such as those made of strips of paper or ribbon, may be attached permanently using masking tape or a hot glue gun. Simply decide on placement somewhere along the circle and secure them to the inner side of the outer hoop. Heavy decorations must be attached to the outer hoop with string. Cut a number of strings slightly longer than you would like your objects to hang. You may make them all one length, but staggered strings of different lengths will look better. Attach one end of each string to each decoration, either through adhesive or by tying a hoop around the object. Separate objects into pairs of roughly the same weight. Tie the opposite end of each string around the outer hoop. Make sure that each paired item is directly across from the other to create balance. This method may also be used for light objects, such as beads or origami, which you would prefer to hang rather than attach directly. With lighter objects, balancing them is not necessary."
