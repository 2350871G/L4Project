For example, you\u2019ll need to make sure you have a masonry chimney that extends at least 3-4 feet above your roof. You\u2019ll also need a surround and hearth for this type of fireplace. Typically, the hearth should extend about 16-18 inches from the fireplace, so make sure you have the space. Make sure that you also have a space near the fireplace where you can store wood."
