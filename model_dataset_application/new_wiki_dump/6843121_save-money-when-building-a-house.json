Because these lots are undesirable and have likely never been developed before, they generally go for a lower price than a lot that is in close proximity with infrastructure and other homes. Talk to your Realtor about purchasing a problematic lot in your area. While they might be cheaper to obtain, these lots can cost you more in development costs later. For instance, if you have a rocky piece of land, you\u2019ll need to blast or clear away the rock in order to set a foundation. If the land has a lot of trees on it, you\u2019ll need to clear them, too. If the land is too far from local infrastructure, you might need to pay a lot to connect your home to sewer, gas, and electrical lines."

This way, you\u2019ll be able to save money by buying a larger lot and splitting it in half (or partitioning it into fractions that you both find agreeable), then having your friend or family member pay you for the portion of land that they opted to live on. Make sure that you read through the home owners association CC&Rs and the local zoning laws regarding subdividing. There may be a minimum size or a rule against subdividing. Look into whether or not this is an option for you. You may also want to request that a contingency that addresses your intention be included along with the offer. Also, make sure that you look into what you can legally build on the property. Sometimes you will not be allowed to build certain structures or keep certain types of vehicles on the property, such as boats and RVs."

Avoid investing in high-end finishes, expensive millwork, and fancy decorative components. Reject landscaping requests. Just before completion, the builder may offer to do the landscaping for you. They will usually charge far more than it would cost for you to do it yourself. Keep in mind that you should negotiate any extras with the builder when you are developing the contract.
