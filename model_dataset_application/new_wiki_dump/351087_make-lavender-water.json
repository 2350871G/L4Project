To remove them from the stems, hold a stem over the glass bowl. Gently pinch the stem at its base, and run your fingers from the base to the tip. The buds will fall off into the bowl. You can also buy dried lavender buds that have already been removed from their stems. Look in gourmet food stores or herb shops. This is a great way to use lavender plants that may be growing in your yard."
