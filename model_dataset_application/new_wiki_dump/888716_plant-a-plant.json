          "description":"Each plant needs adequate space to extend its roots and leaves. Pick a growing spot based on what the plant will look like when it reaches full size. Leave space between other plants you have. Research your plant variety online to find information on its spacing needs. You may receive planting information when you buy the plant. For example, the spacing recommendation is often printed on the back of packets bulbs come in. If you grow a plant in a pot, the pot needs to be a little wider than the plant."

          "headline":"Choose a spot that provides proper sunlight.",
          "description":"The amount of sunlight your plant needs depends on which variety you grow. Many plants, including lots of flowers, grasses, and trees, grow better in spots with 6 or more hours of sunlight a day. Watch your environment to see how the sunlight changes throughout the day. Search for information on your plant's sunlight requirements before planting. Some plants grow better in partial shade, which is 4 to 6 hours of sunlight. This includes garden plants such as begonias, lettuce, and carrots. A few plants survive in full shade, such as dead nettle, foxglove, yew, and English ivy."

          "description":"Most plants, including lots of bulbs, grasses, and flowers, grow better in well-drained soil. Watch your yard after a rainy day. Any spots that have pools of water a few hours after the rain stops are generally poor planting spots. You can amend poor draining spots by mixing sand into the soil. Plants put in pots can be left outdoors, but may need extra watering. For example, annuals like marigold or coriander can dry out in warm climates."

Adjust your soil as needed to improve your planting location. This doesn't need to be done for potted plants, since you will use potting soil. Mix limestone into the soil in order to raise the pH. Add sulfur or aluminum sulphate to lower the pH. If the soil pH is bad in a particular area, you may be able to find better soil elsewhere in your yard.

          "description":"Pots made of plastic, resin, or fiberglass are inexpensive and resistant to damage. They also retain moisture better than clay pots. Plants in these pots do not have to be watered as frequently. Overwatering your plant is easier with these pots. If you are unsure about how much water to use, choose clay pots. Plastic is a good choice for moisture-loving plants such as orchids, philodendrons, bromeliads, and aloe vera."

          "description":"The main advantage of a clay pot is that more air gets into the soil, leading to a healthier plant. However, this means that water drains more quickly. Clay pots are heavier than plastic pots, but they have a natural aesthetic and look decorative outdoors. Ceramic pots are similar to clay and terracotta pots, except they resist water a little better. Clay pots are a good choice for plants that grow in dry soil, such as evergreens and succulents like cacti."

          "headline":"Choose a container with drainage holes in the bottom.",
          "description":"Any pot you use needs to have a series of holes in the bottom in order to let out excess water. Set the pot on a plant saucer, a broken pot shard, or another tray that will collect the drained water. If you use a pot without holes, place a layer of pebbles at the bottom. This will lift the plant's roots out of the water. Excess water in the pot leads to root rot, which destroys the plant."

        {
          "headline":"Use a pot that is the same size as the plant.",
          "description":"Choosing the wrong size of pot can be harmful to your plant. The ideal pot is as wide as the plant. Get a pot 2 to 4 in (5.1 to 10.2 cm) wider if you know the plant will grow quickly. Plants cannot spread their roots in small pots. In large pots, water collects and rots plants. Once your plant looks too big for the pot, you will need to transfer it to a pot the next size up."

          "headline":"Purchase an organic potting soil mix.",
          "description":"Potted plants, even if they are left outside, require soil designed for use in pots. You can get potting mixes at a gardening center. Look for soil mixes made with a combination of peat moss, vermiculite, and organic matter. Cacti and succulents require a special cacti and succulent potting mix that drains faster. This will be labeled on the bag of soil. Avoid using dirt from your yard or garden. It isn't suitable for use in pots."

          "headline":"Fill the pot with soil so the plant's base is near the rim.",

The base is where the roots meet the stem. The root ball needs to be centered in the pot. Leave a hole in the middle of the soil for it. Dampening the soil a little can help you mix it into the pot. Read the manufacturer's instructions to find out how much water to add."

Then. place the plant in the new pot and cover the roots. Avoid tugging on the plant's stem, since this can damage it. If the plant is stuck in the dirt, gently work around the edge of the soil with a spade or trowel. Be careful to avoid breaking the root ball."

          "headline":"Remove the plant from its pot or netting.",
          "description":"Always take your plant out of its container before putting it into the ground. Containers prevent plant roots from spreading through the soil, and your plant will be unable to acclimate and collect nutrients. Flowers come in pots or plastic containers. Grip the plant's stem with 1 hand, tip the plant over, and brace the root ball with your other hand as you lift the plant. Some trees have netting around the root ball. Cut the netting string with scissors. You can then unwrap the netting off the roots."

          "headline":"Inspect and prune damaged roots.",
          "description":"Before planting, look for any roots that look unusually thick and woody. Roots that are already partially cut should be removed, as well as any roots that wrap around the plant. These roots can cause a variety of problems that ruin the plant. Use a sharp knife, a pair of gardening shears, or a shovel. Sever the root as close to the plant as possible. Try to break up the root ball as little as possible. You can remove some of the dirt from the bottom of flowers and container-grown trees to locate their roots. For flowers and container-grown trees, you can gently reposition the roots so they point outwards. This isn't necessary for trees with root balls covered in netting."

          "headline":"Make a garden bed for flowers and bushes.",

          "headline":"Dig a hole 2 to 3 times wider than the plant's root ball.",
          "description":"If the plant came in a container, you can use that as a comparison. Measuring the space with measuring tape can help as well. A properly widened hole gives the plant plenty of space to grow. This is important for flowers as well as bushes and trees. Consider how far the plant will extend after it grows. A wide hole can help you put enough space between this plant and others. For grass seeds, till the entire growing space. The seeds need to be scattered as close together as possible so the grass looks full."

          "headline":"Deepen the hole so the plant's root crown is at the soil line.",
          "description":"The depth the hole needs to be depends on the size of your plant. Dig the hole as deep as the root ball. Many plants, such as annuals, perennials, and bulbs, need a hole about 8 in (20 cm). The hole will need to be deeper for partially-grown trees. Research your plant online to find the proper growing conditions it needs. Some plants, such as tomatoes and potatoes, need to be planted deeper. The soil may come up as far as the lowest leaves on the plants."

Rake the soil level, making sure it covers the plant's roots. Then, compact the soil by gently pressing down on it with a spade, shovel, or another tool. Avoid stepping on the soil, since this can damage the plant's roots. If you need more soil, purchase an organic topsoil from a gardening center."

        {
          "headline":"Water the soil until it is moist.",
          "description":"Thoroughly watering the soil removes any leftover air pockets. Add enough water so the moisture reaches about 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) deep. This should be enough to help most plants acclimate without causing waterlogged soil. You may need to add more water to moisten the soil around large trees and bushes. Test the soil by rolling it between your fingers. Moist soil clumps into a ball that doesn't break when you drop it."
        },

Pour water as needed throughout the week. Flowers, grasses, and small bushes can be watered with a hose, watering can, or irrigation system.
