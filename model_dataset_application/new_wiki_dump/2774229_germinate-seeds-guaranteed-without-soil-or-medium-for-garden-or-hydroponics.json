Left too long like this and the seeds could die. You can wrap them inside the towel to simulate being in the ground. You can use indirect sunlight or some other heat source. Best to place them indoors as this will keep them at a moderate temperature (not too hot or cold) at all times. Note: seeds don't need sun, just heat, and water. Their plants need sun. So, placing them on a heater or some warm source is okay too, but creating a fire hazard should be avoided at all cost."

Wicking gardens are about the same as regular dirt gardening, but there is some caution as these may contain too much water for the plant."
