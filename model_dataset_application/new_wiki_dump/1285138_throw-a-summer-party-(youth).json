      "headline":"Decide when you want the party.",
      "description":"Make sure you have permission from your legal guardian first, and then pick the date and time. No use having it at the end of summer when it's time for school! And no use in the middle as many of your friends may be away on holiday. Instead, have your party the day after you break up for summer, or on the very same day! Hey, you can even invite your friends round after school and have them sleep over! You could ask your friends when they'll be free and agree on a date together. Make sure the weather is looking good for that day, and make sure it starts at a time of day when it will be sunny and warm."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Decide guest list and related details.",
      "description":"Who are you going to invite? Is it going to be a mixed party? Or girls only bash? Boys only? You decide! Make sure you have plenty of friends to enjoy the day away with! Play around with different summery themes (eg. pineapples, flamingos, watermelons)"

    {
      "headline":"Get the stuff you'll need.",
      "description":"It's great to have lots of other activities too! Especially if you have a smaller circular pool, not everyone will fit at the same time-depending on how many people you invite! So I always like to have a table-tennis/ping-pong net game, basketball and volleyball all set up! Put out some other plastic toys such as bowling or sand pits! It may seem childish, but it's a lot of fun! Think about having a water fight, you could ask your friends to bring along a water gun. Make sure you have a nice big grassy area for your party to take place in."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Turn on the water!",
      "description":"It's finally summer! Boiling hot days and cool summer nights! Get those sprinklers on, so even when your chilling in the shade - you still get that occasional spritz of mist!"
    },
    {
      "headline":"Get lots of yummy food!",
      "description":"In fact - go to a store and just buy loads of food in bulk, that way it'll keep your buddies going throughout the day (and night if you're having a sleepover) and will probably last you the whole week too! Remember to get drinks as well, the sun can dehydrate you quickly! You could make swimming pool jelly or pink lemonade! !"

      "headline":"Relax when the party starts, play some cool surf music and wait for that sun to shine!",

      "headline":"When night comes, don't be sad!",
      "description":"You don't have school the next day! School's out! When it gets really dark get some lights: Christmas lights or tea lights, candles, whatever! Put them everywhere! Even put some in the pool! (provided no one is swimming). If you can, try to get a hold of some sky lanterns and light them up with your friends. Although, these can be expensive, so you can just set fire to paper instead and watch it float!"

      "description":"If you have a portable large screen projector, put it outside and watch a chick flick with your gals (or a uni-sex film when you're with the guys!) and watch a film in the garden! With all the lights down and some candlelight, it's a beautiful scene!"

    {
      "headline":"In the morning, help your buds to clean up!",

    {
      "headline":"Don't let them go too soon!",
      "description":"Go out at around noon (provided you're up by then!) and spend the day in your local city or park. For you Londoners, Hyde Park or Oxford Street is the place to hit! Stay out all evening and catch a new movie in theaters."

    {
      "headline":"End the day with some late night shopping with your best buddies!",

      "headline":"Get home at a reasonable time.",
