Every time your opponent moves, move your queen in that same direction 1 square.  If your queen is on the edge of the board and cannot move in the same direction as the opposition king, move two squares across so it's still an L-shape away from the king.  When the enemy king is on the edge of the board, cut off the king so that it only has one row on the edge of the board on which to move.
