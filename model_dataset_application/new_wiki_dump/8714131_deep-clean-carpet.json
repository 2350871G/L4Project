Wait for fifteen or twenty minutes. Blot the stain out with a damp cloth or sponge, but do not rub. If you do not have a spot cleaning solution on hand, you can use shaving cream. Spray the cream onto the stain, and wait 30 minutes. Blot it away, and spray the spot with vinegar. Wipe away any leftover residue. You can make your own spot cleaning solution by mixing 1/4 cup (75 g) of salt, 1/4 cup (100 g) of Borax, and \u20444 cup (59 mL) of vinegar. Put the paste on stained areas, and wait until it dries before you vacuum it up. If you don\u2019t have Borax, you could use baking soda or washing soda instead."

If you have many rugs and carpets in your home or if you deep clean your carpets more than once or twice a year, you may want to invest in a carpet cleaner. If you\u2019re not ready to commit, you can rent these machines for a day from grocery stores, hardware stores, or even pet stores. Make sure you get a cleaner that you can easily lift or move. Remember that once you fill it with water, the machine will weigh even more. No matter if you buy or rent a steam cleaner, you will have to purchase the cleaning solution yourself.

Once you have filled the tank, you can plug the machine in. Do not plug in the machine before adding the water and cleaning solution. If someone in your home has respiratory issues or if you are uncomfortable with the use of chemicals in your home, you can use a cup of white vinegar instead of cleaning solution in the tank.
