      "description":"Battling with your Larvitar in gyms or in the wild will get you experience towards evolving. Try to seek out what is weak against your Larvitar for battles. Larvitar is both a rock- and ground-type Pok\u00e9mon and is strong against Poison (Koffing), Fire (Vulpix), Bug (Caterpie), Flying (Pidgeot), Electric (Pikachu), Rock (Geodude), and Steel (Aron). Avoid fighting Pok\u00e9mon that are strong against your Larvitar. Just like the ground-type Pok\u00e9mon having an advantage over electric-types, your Larvitar also has a weakness against Grass, Bug, and Water Pok\u00e9mon, like Oddish, Caterpie, and Squirtle. These Pok\u00e9mon have a higher chance of beating your Larvitar, which will cost you time and life-points. Use potions to help you gain experience quickly. Since you need to battle with Larvitar to level him up, keep potions on hand to heal him or rid him of lingering skills, like Poison Sting, rather than spending time at a Pok\u00e9mon Center."
