You can also draw eyes, whiskers, and a nose on the cat\u2019s face with a marker or paint. For a 3D craft, glue googly eyes on the front and use pipe cleaners as whiskers."

Run your finger firmly along the fold to hold it in place. It helps to hold the frog in place at the top tip while you make this fold. Fold about 1/3 of the bottom of the frog up towards the top. You\u2019re beginning the folds that will let your frog jump. Bring the legs and bottom of the body up, creasing it securely. Don\u2019t fold the shape completely in half or it won\u2019t look like a frog. Fold the bottom of the frog back onto itself, flipping the legs down. Make another fold near the bottom, this time folding the paper away from you. This is similar to making a pleat. The legs will untuck and point down, away from the head. Add googly eyes to the top of the frog or glue on red paper tongues if you\u2019d like. How to Make Your Frog Jump\nSet the frog with its legs down on a flat surface. Press down on the back body (where you made the pleated folds), then release quickly to let it spring up. Creating an Origami Fox Fold a square piece of paper in half diagonally. Bring 2 opposite corners together and crease the fold. This will form a triangle shape. You can use any type, color, or size of square paper. Origami paper is best for beginners because it is easiest to fold. Bring the 2 bottom corners of the triangle up to the top corner. Your paper will now be in a smaller square. Line up the edges in the center as you fold the corners. Make sure the edges are just slightly touching. You don\u2019t want them to overlap, but you also don\u2019t want there to be a gap between them. Fold the 2 sides of the square backwards along the diagonal. Bring the 2 corners on either side of the open fold together behind the square. You\u2019ll now have a triangle shape again, with 2 flaps. If it\u2019s easier, you can flip the paper over to make the fold. Fold the side with open edges 1/3 of the way towards the other corner. This side will be one of the sides formed by the right angle of the triangle. Line up the bottom of the fold with the edge on the bottom of the triangle. Crease it firmly to hold it in place. The bigger the section that you fold over, the bigger the fox\u2019s head will be. Pull open the corner of the flap on the piece you just folded. There should be 2 layers on your folded-over section. Take the bottom corner of just the top layer and pull it back in the opposite direction of the fold. Be gentle when pulling the corner to avoid ripping the flap. Fold the tip in the center down to create the head. As you pull open the flap, there will be a small triangular piece in the middle that automatically begins folding down. Run your finger along the fold to crease it so it doesn\u2019t pop back up. If you want to decorate your fox, add a face with markers, paint, or googly eyes.",
