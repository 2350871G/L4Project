If your mom doesn\u2019t have a preference, then choose flowers that appeal to your taste.

Make sure the colors of the fillers complement the colors of the bigger flowers. Some examples of flowers that work great as fillers are spiraea, lavender, hellebore, statice, and seeded eucalyptus. For example, seeded eucalyptus and lavender pair well with white or pastel colored roses and dahlias."

Some great choices for greenery are seeded eucalyptus, bells of Ireland, ruscus, penny gum, rosemary, forsythia, and astilbe."

Lay the string on the table and place your bouquet on top. Then wrap the string around the stems and secure it with a bow or a fancy knot.

Use three to four different colors of tissue paper. For a rustic look, use brown parchment paper instead of tissue paper."
