The leaves should be perky and green and the skin should be smooth and unbroken. If you\u2019re going to cook the beets, choose beets that are similar in size. Otherwise, they will cook at different rates. If the beetroot skin is wrinkled, the beetroot is too old."

First, lay a plastic re-sealable bag on your cutting board. Next, use a knife to score the bag two or three times. Place your trimmed and cleaned beetroot in the bag and store it in the refrigerator. Trimmed and cleaned beetroots will stay fresh for about a week in the refrigerator. To help them stay fresh keep them in the crisper drawer. Uncleaned beetroots can be stored in a dark place for three days or in the refrigerator for ten days."
