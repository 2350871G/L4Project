This gap allows the stair to grow loose, so that one part rubs against another and/or the nails or screws holding them together. If you don\u2019t have access to the underside of your stairs, locating the riser by sight is easy, but finding the stringers requires your ear. Gently tap the tread with a hammer.

Be careful to insert the shim only far enough to fill the existing gap. Avoid driving it in to the point that the thicker end begins to separate the stairs\u2019 parts even more.

Tell your partner to step off of the tread. Insert the nozzle into the gap if you can. If not, draw a bead of glue along its length and then push the glue into the gap with any long object that is thin enough to fit into the gap. Carpenter glue and construction adhesive are different products. Carpenter glue typically works best for wood-on-wood projects. However, in this instance, construction adhesive is also suitable if your stairs are exposed to a lot of moisture, since its formula is more water-resistant than carpenter glue. Place a heavy object on top of the tread while the glue dries so it is flush against the stringer or riser underneath."

Cut a wooden board to the length needed. Use carpenter glue or construction adhesive to line the side that will make contact with the tread. Place the board flat against the stringer or riser, with the top pressed flush against the tread. Then nail or screw the board into the stringer or riser. This method is only meant to eliminate gaps caused by slight warping or wear-and-tear, not to reinforce the strength of weak stairs."

First, mark two spots on the tread, along the stringer or riser underneath, to drill starter-holes for your nails. Make sure these spots are separated by a wide enough margin so that the nails don\u2019t intersect. Using a drill-bit with a smaller diameter than your nails, use a drill to create a shallow starter-hole for the tip of each nail.
