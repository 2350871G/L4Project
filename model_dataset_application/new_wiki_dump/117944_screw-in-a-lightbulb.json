If you feel too much resistance you may need to put on heavy duty work gloves before unscrewing. If the bulb breaks your hand will be protected from the sharp glass shards. Then you can try to remove the base of the bulb by hand. If the bulb breaks and you can\u2019t get the base out with the gloves, dispose of the shards properly and clean the area.

To test this, put the bulb in another light fixture and see if it turns on. When in doubt, get a new light bulb. If the bulb has a black spot, you\u2019re using a bulb with higher wattage than recommended for the light fixture. Buy a lower wattage bulb. If the lightbulb was flickering or burns out too quickly, the old bulb was screwed in too tightly."

If you encounter a lot of resistance and the bulb isn\u2019t completely screwed in yet, double check that you have the right bulb size. The base of the bulb should perfectly match the base of the old bulb. If you bought the wrong size bulb, don\u2019t try to make it work. Go back to the store and get the right bulb. Once the bulb is in place, test the bulb by turning the light back on. If it doesn\u2019t work, unscrew the bulb, blow on the socket to remove debris, and try again."

However, if you\u2019d like to use energy efficient bulbs, you can usually find a Light Emitting Diode (LED) or Compact Fluorescent (CFL) option in your bulb size. These kinds of lightbulbs use less energy and save you money in the long run. A CFL bulb can use up to 75% less energy than an incandescent bulb and can last up to nine years. An LED bulb can use up to 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb and can last up to twenty years."
