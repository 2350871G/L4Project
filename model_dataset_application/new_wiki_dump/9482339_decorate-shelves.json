Put smaller plants on shelves that can contain the entire plant safely \u2013 you don't want them to be knocked over easily. Remember to only use indoor plants that are safe for kids and pets, if you have them. Some plants (like peace lilies, poinsettias, English ivy, and devil's ivy) can be poisonous when ingested. Consider getting a plant with a trailing vine that can hang off the side of the shelf for a nice decorative look. Plants can also stimulate memory and concentration skills, not to mention adding a lovely touch of color to your interior decorating. Make sure that the shelf's location fulfills the necessary light requirements for your indoor plant. You don't want to accidentally kill all of your indoor plants."
