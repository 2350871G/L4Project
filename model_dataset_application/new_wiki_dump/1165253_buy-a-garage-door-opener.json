      "headline":"Determine how much power your garage door needs.",
      "description":"Garage door openers are found in three different sizes: 1/3 horsepower, 1/2 horsepower and 3/4 horsepower. You will need to examine if you need an opener to lift one or two doors. You will also need to take into consideration the material and size of the door. If you plan to purchase an opener to lift double doors, you will need to look for an opener that is at least 1/2 horsepower. A single door can be lifted with a 1/3 hp opener. However, an opener with more power will last longer. Oversize, large and heavy doors will need the most horsepower."

      "headline":"Decide what type of drive system you want.",
      "description":"The three main types are belt drive, chain drive and screw drive. Belt drive openers raise and lower the door on rubber belts. This is a very quiet opening and closing. In most cases, this type of garage door opener is on the higher end of pricing. Metal chains raise and lower the garage door on chain driven openers. Naturally, the clanging of the chains causes a more noisy opening and closing. This type of opener is usually lower priced. Screw driven garage door openers raise and lower the door on a threaded rod. This type of opener has fewer parts and is often lower maintenance."
