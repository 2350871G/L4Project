  "text":" Using an Oven Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).  Drain the juice from one of the cans of peaches. Open up both cans of sliced peaches. Leave the juice in one of the cans, and drain the juice from the other. Set the drained juice aside for later. Spread the peaches across the bottom of a baking pan. Get out a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02-centimeter) baking pan. Dump both cans of peaches into the pan. Use a spoon or spatula to spread them evenly across the bottom. You don't have to grease the inside of the pan since you won't be taking the cobbler out of it. You can grease it if you want to, however, to make clean up easier. Pour the dry cake mix over the peaches. Do not add the other ingredients listed on the box. Simply open up the box and pour the dry mix evenly over the peaches. If you have to, use a spoon to spread the mix evenly across the peaches. Do not stir. Cut the butter, then add it to the pan. Slice the butter into 18 pieces, then scatter it evenly across the cake mix and the peaches. Once again, do not stir. Add some flavor with peach juice and ground cinnamon. Pour the reserved peach juice from before over the cake mix. Add a dash of cinnamon over the top for extra flavor. Bake the cobbler for 30 to 35 minutes. As the cobbler bakes, the melting butter and peach juice will mix with the dry cake mix and produce a crumbly crust. The cobbler is ready when it turns a golden brown color. Serve the cobbler. Leave the cobbler in the pan. Use a spatula to cut it and serve it. It will be very crumbly, so don't worry if it falls apart. You can serve it as-is, or with some vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. Using a Slow Cooker Place the canned peaches into a slow cooker. Open up the cans, and dump everything (including the syrup) into a 4 to 6-quart (4 to 6-liter) slow cooker.
