As you check your cake, and add it to the grill, the heat will fluctuate. For a gas grill, you may have to turn on more heaters or close certain vents to bring up the temperature.

  "text":" Setting up Your Grill Turn on the heat on a gas grill. When working with a gas grill, you'll simply need to switch on the heat. If you've never baked on a grill before, it'll take some experimentation to get the grill to the right heat. Start by turning on only one burner and go from there as needed to achieve the proper temperature. Arrange your charcoals for a charcoal grill. If you're using a charcoal grill, you'll have to add charcoals prior to turning the grill on. You want a mixture of direct and indirect heat to bake your cake, so arrange the charcoals in a circle around the sides of the grill. You want an open space in the center, where the cake will sit above. Bring your grill to the proper baking temperature. It will take some experimentation to achieve the proper temperature. Use a oven thermometer to monitor the temperature. Cakes generally should be cooked around 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Try to get the heat at least 25 \u00b0F (\u22124 \u00b0C) hotter.

For a gas grill, you may have to turn on more heaters or close certain vents to bring up the temperature. For a charcoal grill, you may also need to close vents. Adding more charcoal can also help. Making Your Batter Add your peaches to the bottom of a cake pan. Grease an 8-inch (20 centimeter) cake pan. Pour the peaches in the bottom of the pan and use a spoon or spatula to spread them out in an even layer. Mix the sugar, milk, oil, vanilla, and egg. Add the sugar, milk, oil, vanilla, and egg to a mixing bowl. Use either a spoon or electronic mixer to mix everything together into a smooth, even mixture. Add the flour and salt. Mix the flour and salt together in a mixing bowl. Add the flour/salt mixture in small amounts, mixing it in as you go using a spoon or electronic mixer. Keep going until you've added all the flour and salt. When you're done, the batter should be an even consistency throughout. Pour the batter over the peaches. Use a spatula to pour your batter into the pan, covering the peaches. Use a spatula to smooth out the top of the batter. Grilling Your Cake Place a pan filled with water at the bottom of the grill. Take a pan roughly the same size as your cake tray. Fill it with water and place it underneath the grill gate, just below where you'll set your cake. If you're using a charcoal grill, push hot coals around the pan. Bake your cake for 40 minutes. Place your cake on the grill gate, just above the bowl of water. Cover the grill and set a timer for 40 minutes. Adjust the heat occasionally to keep it consistent. Monitor the temperature throughout the cooking process. The temperature will drop on occasion. When this happens, either move the charcoals around to get them smoking again or turn up the heat on a gas grill. You can also close the grill dampers to bring the temperature up. You can use an oven thermometer to monitor the heat. Remove your cake from the grill. After 40 minutes have passed, remove your cake from the grill. Check to make sure it's done by inserting a toothpick or something similar into the cake. If it comes out clean, your cake is cooked. If your cake is not cooked after 40 minutes, grill it for a few extra minutes and check again. Let it cool on a cooling rack for 45 minutes. Then, run a knife along the edges of the cake and remove it from the pan. Cut into slices and serve. Finished. ",
