One popular way to store dried tomatoes is packed tightly in extra-virgin olive oil in a bowl or jar. Pack a mason jar or a regular bowl with the tomatoes and fill in the cracks with some tasty olive oil. Keep these in the refrigerator for several months. Add chopped garlic or other flavors like hot peppers or rosemary to give some extra bite to the tomatoes. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7c\\/Make-Dried-Tomatoes-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-Dried-Tomatoes-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7c\\/Make-Dried-Tomatoes-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-Dried-Tomatoes-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Keep them in ziplock. If you've dried the tomatoes well, they should keep well in ziplock bags on the shelf or in the fridge for several months. Pack them about half full in storage bags and squeeze as much of the air out as possible to ensure the longest shelf life. You can also keep them in airtight containers or jars the same way. They should be fine on the shelf from 6 months to a year. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/88\\/Make-Dried-Tomatoes-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-Dried-Tomatoes-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/88\\/Make-Dried-Tomatoes-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-Dried-Tomatoes-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Freeze them. While there's not much purpose in freezing the tomatoes after you've dried them, it's an option if you've got a full shelf and an empty freezer. Keep them in airtight bags and freeze them for as long as you want.",
