But a yellow, or chocolate cake, from a mix should work fine as well. Bake your cake according to directions; let it cool 15 minutes after removal from oven, then remove the cake from the pan(s) and let them cool completely before messing with them."

      "description":"This is the step where you use a cake leveler (or a knife if you don't have one), and so that the cake doesn't have that \"bump\" in the middle. If you have to level the cake, you can flip the side you cut upside down and use the bottom of your cake as your top; it doesn't get as many crumbs and is less messy that way."

      "headline":"Make icing.",
      "description":"Some people use store bought icing, but it is highly recommended making your own. Store-bought tends to be too gooey to work with. Icing is made by mixing 3/4 cup of shortening and 3/4 cup (one and 1/2 sticks) of butter or margarine that has warmed to room temperature. Mix with an electric mixer, then add approximately 6 cups of powdered sugar, 1 and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, and approximately 3 tablespoon (44.4 ml) of milk. If it's too thick, let it warm up a bit. If it's too gooey, cool it a bit in the fridge."
