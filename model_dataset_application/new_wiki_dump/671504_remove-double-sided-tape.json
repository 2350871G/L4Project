          "description":"Plug your hairdryer into the nearest power outlet and turn it on to a medium or high setting. Hold the hairdryer a few inches away from the tape and let the hot air blow over it, focusing on the edges and corners. This will cause the glue to soften. After a few minutes, set the hairdryer aside and try to pick at one of the corners of the tape with your fingernail. Most of the tape should come off, but you may need to take the hairdryer to it again. If you have very short fingernails, or don't want to ruin a nice manicure, then use a butter knife or pallet instead. If you still have a thin film of residue, you can buff the surface with a scouring pad soaked with warm, soapy water. Avoid using oil or oil-based commercial cleansers."

If you choose to use one of these products on plastic, keep this in mind. Simply pour some of the product over the tape and let it soak for a few minutes, then pull the tape off. If the tape doesn't come off, then try scrubbing it with a scratchy sponge until it does. The chemicals in the fluid will have dissolved the sticky adhesive on the tape.

Simply pour some acetone or nail polish remover onto the tape and let it soak for a few minutes before peeling the tape off. This will be the most effective on fabrics, as it won't stain. This may work on paper and cardboard, but it may also cause the paper to warp and become wrinkled (as with any other liquid).
