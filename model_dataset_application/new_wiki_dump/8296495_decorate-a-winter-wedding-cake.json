White frosting can create a stunning snowy effect and there are countless ways to feature this look. For example, you could have a several-tier cake with white buttercream frosting to mimic snow. Scatter edible snowflakes made out of fondant icing on top of the tiers. Dust the cake with sparkling sugar to create the effect of glittering snow. For a unique look, consider accenting with icicles made out frosting."

          "headline":"Go with a frosty color like ice blue.",
          "description":"This is a particularly great choice if you are already incorporating blue into your overall wedding theme. Tint the frosting or fondant with a very light blue color. The frosting should have a smooth texture so the tiers look like snowy ice blankets. To continue the natural theme, decorate with pinecones. For a snowy effect, speckle the pinecones with white royal icing and dust them with sparkling sugar. Create more natural texture by accenting with chocolate \u201cpine needles.\u201d"

          "headline":"Choose rich reds and chocolate browns.",
          "description":"If you'd prefer not to have a mostly white cake, you still have plenty of options. Have a chocolate cake, or alternate cream and chocolate tiers for an earthy vibe. Rich reds are also very seasonal and red accents look great on a chocolate cake. For example, you could place sprigs of red berries on the tiers. To enhance the Christmas vibe, put sprigs of holly around the red berries. For a less rustic look, line the tiers with red rosettes made of royal frosting or create a red stripe with a velvet ribbon."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Go for drama with gold or silver.",
          "description":"If you want to keep it simple, consider using gold icing on the cake. Use metallic elements to accent, such as gold or iridescent colored rosettes made of icing. Gold icing can be hand painted onto your cake for a very elegant look. If you prefer silver, start with a white cake and create all of the accents in silver. Make one of the tiers silver or go all out and gild your entire cake. Consider the color theme of your wedding. If you are using warm colors like deep red, chocolate brown and cream, accent with gold. If you're using cool colors like ice blue and bright white, accent with silver."

          "description":"Use fresh rosemary sprigs to accent the tiers of the cake. Fresh rosemary smells great and is very seasonal. You could arrange the springs on top or even press them into the icing around the side of each tier. Springs of holly and fern are also great greenery choices. Create arrangements with green pine needles and incorporate pinecones for a winter forest look. Make sure the greenery you choose is food-safe or take precautions to make sure the greenery does not touch the cake. For an even more rustic look, use small twigs, pinecones, brown pine needles or cinnamon sticks on the cake. Make sure the greenery you choose is food-safe or take precautions to make sure the greenery does not touch the cake."

Create small arrangements featuring both or circle the base of each tier with sprigs of baby's breath to create a charming boho effect. Use a frothy bundle of baby's breath as an elegant cake topper. If you're using red in your wedding, this is a great opportunity to use deep red roses on your cake. Peonies and lilies look festive on winter wedding cakes, as well. Make sure to take precautions as lilies are considered toxic. Poinsettias are also an option, but only if you are going for a Christmas theme. Again, make sure to follow food safety by ensuring the Poinsettias do not touch the cake or cake frosting. Poinsettias are considered toxic."

Cranberries, raspberries, blueberries and black berries also look festive. Use a variety of berries or focus on your favorite kind. Create arrangements or simply scatter whole berries on top of each tier. Dust the berries with powdered sugar for a frosty snow effect."

Tuck sprigs of red Christmas berries or rosemary through the center of the bows to complete the seasonal look. If you want a more rustic vibe, use pieces of burlap, lace or twine instead. Wrap gold or red ribbons around the cake for a striped gift-wrap effect. Strips of silver lace also look festive and wintry."

Use pearls around the base, embed them in the frosting or arrange them on top of the tiers. Incorporate ornamental Christmas balls in complimentary colors for a more seasonal look. You could use metallic beading in gold or silver to create a gilded, glittery effect. Crystals look lovely, too."

          "headline":"Use something untraditional for the topper.",

A rustic wedding could have a topper arrangement created out of burlap, fresh herbs and cinnamon sticks. Tiny owl figurines can create a forest-like vibe or tiny snowmen could represent the season. You could also top the cake with an elaborate arrangement of natural materials. Try a combination of pinecones, fresh herbs, twigs, berries, baby's breath and fresh flowers."
