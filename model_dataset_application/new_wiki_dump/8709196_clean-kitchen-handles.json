Use a flathead screwdriver to pop off the middle part on the top. Sometimes, you'll have a notch to help, but you can jimmy the screwdriver into the crack even if it's not there. Inside, use the screwdriver to turn the screw and remove the main part of the handle. Once you get it open, scrub the inside well with soap and water. You can use a toothbrush and a cotton swab to get into the hard-to-reach places. If the top has a label inside, use a pin to pry it out to clean. Dry all the pieces thoroughly. Let them air dry. You don't want to put them back together until they are completely dry because they may grow mold if left wet."
