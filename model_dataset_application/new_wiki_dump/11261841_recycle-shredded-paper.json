Put your compost bin outside the night before collection day so the workers can collect it and take it to the proper facility.

When you want to use your kindling, set the tube at the base of a fire pit and light it so you the wood or coals ignite easier. You can also mix in dryer lint if you want a firestarter that\u2019s more flammable. Be careful since dryer lint catches easily and an open flame or heat source could cause it to ignite."

Let the paper sit in the water for 10 minutes and then blend the paper on medium speed until it forms a thick pulp. Strain the pulp before mixing in 1-2 teaspoons (3-6 g) of prepackaged flower seeds by hand. Shape the pulp into balls or push it into a mold, such as an ice cube tray or muffin tin, and let them dry overnight. When you want to plant one, put the seed bomb in a pot with soil and water it so the seeds can sprout. Use smaller-sized seeds since they\u2019re more likely to grow and won\u2019t take up as much space inside your seed bombs. Cut the seed bombs with cookie cutters if you want to make fun shapes."

Blend the paper on high for about 1 minute before pouring the mixture in a framed window screen that\u2019s sitting in a container of water. Sift the water through the screen so the pulp stays inside of the frame. Set the frame on a dry towel and let the paper dry completely so you can use it for crafts or projects. Paper will get weaker the more times you shred it, so your homemade paper may not be the most durable.Tip: If you want to use your paper sooner, hold a heat gun about 6 inches (15 cm) away on the lowest setting to dry it out."
