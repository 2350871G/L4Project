          "description":"For the most part, firewood merchantry is a local industry, not a regional or national one. As such, you'll need to acquire your lumber from a local dealer. In some areas, chain stores sell firewood as well, but this wood is typically more expensive and lower quality than locally-sourced alternatives. Some states list their firewood dealers on Firewood Scout. For other states, as well as places outside the U.S., search online to find a local dealer. Purchasing local firewood helps prevent the spread of firewood diseases carried by invasive insects."

If you're purchasing hardwood, make sure the lumber is fairly heavy and cannot be easily scratched using your fingernail. If you're purchasing softwood, check that the lumber is light and can be easily scratched using your fingernail. If you're purchasing pre-cured wood, make sure the ends are slightly gray and have small, radial cracks in them."

This is particularly important if you order your wood online or over the phone, since a bill of sale may be your only form of defense if a merchant does not deliver your goods or refuses to give them to you when you arrive.
