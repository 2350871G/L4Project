Once you've worked your way through to the Depths 2 and found the boss room, lower yourself to half a heart and walk in. Mom will always stomp as her first attack."

Reset your runs by holding R until you find a good first item, get rid of any black hearts, and avoid picking up items that do damage independently of you like Demon Baby or Daddy Long Legs. Once you reach the boss fight in Sheol, die to the 2nd stage of the fight where Satan is shooting lasers and tears out of his hands while moving around the room."
