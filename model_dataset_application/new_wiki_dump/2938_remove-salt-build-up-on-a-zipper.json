If not, make sure that the material surrounding the zipper won\u2019t be damaged by soaking it in vinegar. Either look it up or try soaking a test piece of material first. If you're having a salt encrustation issue with scuba gear, take off any parts you can that are not connected to the suit such as hooks, swivels, etc. Depending on how the zipper is mounted on your bag, you may be able to simply submerge the zipper and not the rest of the suit."

Some lubricants are applied to all parts of the zipper, whereas others are for the outer teeth only. Apply the lubricant at room temperature.
