          "description":"Your first step after painting should be to evaluate the curtains and blinds you have in the room. Curtains, blinds, and other window treatments have the effect of darkening a room. By making small changes, you\u2019ll bring more light into your dark room. Remove fabric valances to allow more light in. Take down curtains if they\u2019re limiting the light that can come in. Replace dark colored blinds with light colored blinds. Keep your curtains or blinds open to allow a lot of natural light to enter the room."

          "description":"The simplest way to brighten a dark room is by installing more light fixtures. Placed appropriately, your light fixtures will temper your dark paint and help you create an airy feel. Have an electrician install recessed lighting, if you want. Use desk or table lamps to add more light. Add free standing lights to the darkest areas of your room."

Place a free-standing light near an accent wall. If you have \u201ceyeball\u201d recessed lighting, point it toward the dark area of the room."

          "description":"Another way to brighten a room is to control the type of light your light fixtures give off. While traditional incandescent lightbulbs give off a yellow or goldish light, other types of lights spread a brighter and whiter light. Use LED light bulbs. Pick incandescent or other lights that are labeled \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201cbright.\u201d\nChoose the brightest bulbs your fixture can safely handle. For example, if the fixture can take a 100- watt bulb, don\u2019t use a 60-watt bulb in it."

This is important, as furniture has the largest footprint and therefore exerts the most influence on a room\u2019s character. Move furniture away from a dark accent wall. Make sure the room is open from the entry way. For example, wherever someone enters the room, they should be able to walk straight into the middle of it, instead of being blocked by a table or couch. Don\u2019t cluster too many pieces of furniture in one part of the room. For example, avoid placing an arm chair and side table next to a book case."

The lighter furniture will temper the darkness of the room and create a brighter and more airy feeling. If you have dark wood furniture, replace it with white or light wood colored furniture. If you can\u2019t swap furniture, consider changing small things. For example, you may be able to get a lighter couch cover for your couch.

Make sure to focus on dark pieces of furniture, if you can. Try not to put too many pieces of furniture against your walls. Instead, make sure to keep large sections of wall open. If you have a dark part of the room, try to keep dark furniture out of it. For example, if there is a part of the room that is not well-lit, don\u2019t put a dark brown chair there."

Mirrors work well in dressing rooms, bedrooms, foyers, and hallways. For example, position a mirror opposite of a window to reflect light throughout the room.
