          "description":"Many scrapbooking projects will benefit from having multiple adhesives at your disposal. Having many adhesives will allow you to temporarily position a photograph, make a short note about a memory, or permanently glue a banner or heading. Wet and dry adhesives come in permanent, repositionable, and temporary types, which means some are best for permanent adhesion while others allow you to keep items in place before firmly adhering them."

          "headline":"Choose wet adhesives for stronger and more permanent gluing.",
          "description":"Wet adhesives, or glue, come in liquid, paste, stick, or spray forms, and are generally more permanent and take longer to dry. As wet adhesives tend to be more permanent, they are often best suited for more permanent choices, like headings, banners, and photo mats. Although wet adhesives are generally stronger and more permanent, there are a few that allow for a longer working time before drying."

          "headline":"Choose dry adhesives to easily modify and reposition items.",
          "description":"Dry adhesives, such as tape, tabs, dots, and photo corners, tend to be easier to remove and modify, and tend to mount items instantly. Dry adhesives tend to be less permanent and are more easily repositioned. Keep dry adhesives on hand to temporarily hold items in place, adhere photographs, and to keep your options open. There are a few dry adhesives that are designed to instantly stick to whatever surface they are placed on, so be sure to double check which is which."

          "headline":"Avoid acidic adhesives.",
          "description":"Acidic adhesives will destroy the quality of photographs and paper overtime. Even trace exposure to acidic adhesives can cause lasting effects and further deteriorate your paper or photograph. Avoid sticky notes. The adhesive on the backs of sticky notes is acidic! Even if applied momentarily, the acid will affect and damage your paper or photograph. Always read the label. If you are unsure as to whether your adhesive is acidic, throw it out or set it aside for another project. Better safe than sorry! Beware of adhesives with strong odors. Adhesives that have strong odors are more likely to be acidic and damaging to the items in your scrapbook."

Not only are glue sticks easy to apply, they are also repositionable until dry, safe for children, and tend to not crinkle paper. Apply glue sticks in thin layers for optimal adhesion and minimal wear on the paper. Be cautious of how much glue you apply with a glue stick, many people tend to apply too much glue due to the ease in application."

Spray adhesives also come in tacky, less permanent forms, and are ideal for adhering items that you would like to move with minimal damage. Spray adhesives can contain fumes that can be toxic to inhale. Be sure to use spray adhesives in well-ventilated areas."

          "headline":"Use paste for more durable and permanent adhesion.",
          "description":"Pastes are generally chunkier water-based glues, which mean they take much longer to dry than sticks or sprays and are more likely to wrinkle thin materials like paper. Pastes are best used with more durable materials, like thick card-stock or water-proof material, and for more permanent solutions. Pastes are all-purpose glues and are often non-toxic and child safe."

          "description":"Liquid glues, like sprays, come in a wide variety strengths and drying times, and often come in applicators like bottles, pens, or rollers. Quick drying liquid glues, like PVA or SuperGlue, come in bottles and are ideal for most adhering purposes, with the exception of photographs. Glue pens generally allow for a longer working time without jeopardizing the strength of the glue."

From thick and embellishing foam tape to invisible transparent tape. Double sided tape can be useful for adhering photos or ephemera, like stamps or postcards, to your scrapbook. Use foam tape to embellish objects and give them dimensionality. Transparent tape is ideal for invisible adhesion."

Simply unroll the liner and carefully place a clear Glue-Dot in the place you wish to adhere an embellishment or accessory. Tabs, like tape, come in many specialized forms, and can be used for adhering photos, paper, ephemera, or objects. Tabs and glue dots bind almost instantly, so be sure they are placed in the exact spot you wish to adhere. They may be removed, but often will cause the paper or surface to tear. Glue dots are generally safe, but are best kept away from children as they are small in size and can be easily ingested."

          "description":"One of the main concerns with adhering photographs is not only the strength of the glue, but also its quality. Corner mounts provide a strong, long-lasting adhesive, while minimizing negative effects on your photos. As a dry adhesive, corner mounts allow for a longer working time and can be repositioned with minimal damage to the adhering surface. Corner mounts are ideal for holding original photographs in place, without applying any damaging adhesive to them. Make sure to appropriately crop your photograph to best fit the corner mounts. Use fasteners, like brads, to adhere different objects together with style. Fasteners technically have no adhesive material or glue on them, but become an \u201cadhesive\u201d by piercing the paper or surface."
