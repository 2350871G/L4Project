Think about why an item is important so you can decide if you\u2019re ready to let it go. As an example, you might have kept old birthday cards that remind you how loved you are.

Ask yourself if each sentimental item you have makes you feel happy or not. Only keep items that bring you joy. For instance, let\u2019s say a loved one gave you a decorative plate they hand painted. You might choose to keep this item because it makes you feel happy. On the other hand, you might let go of a flower bouquet that you caught at a wedding because it\u2019s just gathering dust.

To help you release gifts, remind yourself that your friends and family likely want you to live a happy life. If a gift isn\u2019t serving you, give it away or sell it. Additionally, keep in mind that the person who gave you the gift likely wants it to be used and enjoyed. If you aren\u2019t using a gifted item, give it to someone who will."
