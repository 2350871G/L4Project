It\u2019s also common for people to enjoy their cottage cheese with crackers or other crispy items, which can add extra dimension to the texture. Since it\u2019s high in protein, calcium and other beneficial nutrients, cottage cheese makes a well-balanced snack on its own.

The sweet and tangy notes of the fruits and veggies will provide a pleasant contrast to the smooth, subtle flavor of the cottage cheese. A veggie tray with cottage cheese for dipping can make a light, refreshing poolside snack in the summertime."

A layer of cottage cheese will soften the crunchy toast and keep it from being quite so bland. Devour your loaded toast as-is, or top it with other ingredients like savory nut butters, raisins or a drizzle of honey. You could also try cottage cheese on a bagel or toasted muffin. Cottage cheese is higher in protein than both milk and cream cheese, and lower in fat, too."

Cottage cheese is a staple of many salad bars for good reason\u2014it complements the many different components well without making the salad soggy the way dressings tend to do. Cottage cheese can be used to hold together other types of salads, as well, like chicken or tuna salad."

Whip the cheese by hand and layer it between strips of pasta and zesty tomato sauce. For even more flavor, fold in grated parmesan, a little minced garlic and some fresh parsley or basil. Strain the excess moisture out of the cottage cheese and pulse it in the food processor for a few seconds to make the consistency more like ricotta. Don\u2019t worry about ruining dinner, even if you\u2019re not the biggest fan of cottage cheese\u2014once everything is cooked together, you won\u2019t even be able to taste the difference."

          "description":"Stir cottage cheese into sauces or stews as they simmer to bulk them up and make them more filling without the need to add meat. When heated, the soft curds will set up particularly well in dishes with creamy bases, such as vodka sauce or stroganoff. Stir cottage cheese into your leftovers just before you reheat them to keep them from getting too dry. Reach for a carton of cottage cheese instead of a can of creamed soup when you\u2019re whipping up a savory casserole."

Try making dense confections like biscuits and scones with cottage cheese instead of buttermilk."

The result is a satisfying (but not too heavy), complete breakfast that will leave you feeling energized and get your day off to a healthy start. You can also spoon it straight onto the top, along with maple syrup, banana slices, chocolate chips or your choice of add-ons. Incorporating cottage cheese into pancake (and waffle) batter is a great way to get a protein-packed breakfast without resorting to cooking with protein powder, which can often interfere with the flavor of a dish."

This will up the protein content considerably, and since it\u2019s thicker, you\u2019ll never have to worry about watery smoothies again. Choosing to include sweeter flavors can help balance out the saltiness of the cottage cheese. Add cottage cheese to make-ahead smoothie packs and refrigerate.

In fact, it\u2019s smooth and salty enough to make butter unnecessary, which will help spare you even more calories and fat.

A decadent spinach-artichoke or creamy bleu cheese buffalo chicken dip made with cottage cheese is sure to be a crowd pleaser at your next dinner party or casual get together. For Mediterranean-inspired dishes, create your own skinny version of tzatziki by blending cottage cheese with cucumber, dill, mint and lemon juice. Don\u2019t forget to strain the liquid whey out of the cottage cheese before folding it into your dip."
