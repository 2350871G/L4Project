      "headline":"Become familiar with what the Xenomorph looks like.",
      "description":"Before you can draw the Xenomorph, you need to know what you're drawing. Look up pictures online, or better yet watch the \"Alien\" movies. If you are new to drawing, it is recommended you copy the pictures included with each step. If you are more experienced, you can find a picture that you like online to use as a model. If you're particularly confident in your abilities, try drawing without a model at all! If you choose this last option, be sure to view pictures online from various angles so you have a sense of what it looks like in three dimensions."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Get your drawing supplies together.",
      "description":"You will need pencils and paper at the very least. You may also want a pen to make the edges more distinctive, and crayons for shading. Standard sized white printer paper is optimal, although other types of paper can be used as well. Also note that a ball-point pen might be easier to draw with than a felt-tip. Regardless, make sure you are comfortable with the supplies you are using, as this will affect the quality of your final drawing."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Draw the outline.",
      "description":"The first thing to do is sketch the shape of the Xenomorph's body. Don't worry about the details for now - you can fill those in later."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Draw the hands, feet, and back.",
      "description":"The Xenomorph has three sharp claws on each hand. It's feet each have two claws in front and one in the back. Also, it has four \"spikes\" protruding from it's back, although they are flattened at the end."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Add spikes to the head and the tail.",
      "description":"The spikes on the head should be sharp and curved slightly backwards. They should start approximately above the back of the jaw and continue slightly past the neck, leaving space at the end of the head. The spikes along the tail are shorter and flatter at the end, having a rectangular or even squarish shape. These spikes should be drawn along the entire length of the tail."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Fill the mouth with teeth.",
      "description":"One of the Xenomorph's scariest features is it's razor sharp set of teeth. Make sure they are big and visible!"
    },
    {
      "headline":"Draw the ribcage.",
      "description":"The Xenomorph has a visible ribcage, giving it's stomach a skeleton-like quality."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Add detail to the head.",
      "description":"Draw curved lines extending from the base of the spikes on the Xenomorph's head. This will make the head look three-dimensional."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Add detail to the tail.",
      "description":"Like you did with the head, draw curved lines extending from the spikes on the tail. Make sure the curves match the direction of the tail so it looks three-dimensional."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Fill in the knees and legs.",
      "description":"The Xenomorph has three joints in it's legs. It also has a section on it's thighs that is a different texture from the rest of it's legs. Make sure to mark off the claws from the rest of it's toes as well."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Fill in the arms.",
      "description":"Draw the elbows and mark off the claws from the Xenomorph's fingers. Also, add a protrusion from it's shoulders."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Shade in the Xenomorph.",
      "description":"The Xenomorph is very dark grey, which allows it to hide in the shadows. Use a pencil or crayon to color it's body. You can also use black or dark green coloring. Choose a point where you want the light to be coming from in the drawing, and shade parts of the body that are closer to the light less dark, and parts that are further from the slight or hidden by shadow darker. Also try to make the shading reveal the three-dimensional nature of the creature, especially on the head. Remember that the the Xenomorph's legs have a part in the center that is a different texture from the rest - make sure your shading reflects this."
