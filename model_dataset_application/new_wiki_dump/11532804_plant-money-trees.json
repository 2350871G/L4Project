However, too much sunlight can be deadly for the money tree; avoid placing them right in front of a window or in a backyard without shade. While some money trees can survive outdoors, the temperature cannot drop below 45 \u00b0F (7 \u00b0C) degrees. That's why most people keep them as indoor houseplants. Money trees fare well under fluorescent lights and often are fine in shady areas as long as some light gets through."

If you're repotting a plant, you'll want a new pot that is about 2 inches (5.1 cm) larger than the first pot. If the pot is any bigger, the soil could become soggy, and soggy soil is deadly for a money tree. Whether you're planting or repotting, your pot needs to have at least one drainage hole."

To make your own nutrient-rich soil, mix 5 parts soil with 2 parts coarse sand and 1 part perlite, which is a non-organic additive found at any nursery. If you want to purchase pre-mixed potting soil, a good choice is peat-moss-based soil, a popular option online and at nurseries. Flower soil and cactus soil also work well for the money tree."
