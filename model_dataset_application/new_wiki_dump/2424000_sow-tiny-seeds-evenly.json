When you go to pour the seeds into the soil, the sand mixture will help spread the seeds evenly. Pour however many seeds you wish to plant into the sand.

If you\u2019re sowing the seeds directly into the ground, create a shallow furrow in the soil with your finger and sprinkle the seeds from the salt shaker in a line in the indentation. Read the seed packet to see how deep the seeds need to be sown. If you\u2019re planting the seeds in a pot or tiny planter, simply shake the salt shaker 2 or 3 times to release the seeds."

You can also place a strip of toilet paper in a shallow trench in the soil first, and then sprinkle the seeds along the toilet paper. The whiteness of the toilet paper will allow you to better see the seeds as you spread them evenly. The seed tape will be covered lightly with soil, not just left bare.
