If your futon needed to be pulled away from a wall or furniture to be in the bed position, you can now push it back up against a wall or move it to another location. Readjust the mattress, as needed. Folding Trifold Futons Move the bottom section of a trifold futon to your desired placement. You can either tuck the trifold\u2019s third section back up under the middle section to hide it away, or you can simply tuck in the legs of the third section so that the section angles downwards.

Some trifold futons will have options for how far up you\u2019d like to position your seat. If this is the case, lock in your seat using the height adjustments. Give the futon a small shake to ensure the seat adjustments and legs are all stable. Adjust the mattress or padding, if necessary. Position the padding so that it's centered on the futon, making sure that none of it is falling over the edges. Once the padding is perfect, it's ready to be used. Unfolding a Futon Pull the futon frame away from the wall or other furniture. Since the mattress will be spread out, it\u2019s important to move the frame at least 8 inches (20 cm) away from the wall or any other obstacles that might be in the way to prevent damage. Make sure you have plenty of room to walk around the futon so you can easily reach the frame. Grab the bottom of the frame. This should be the part where your legs would be if you were sitting on the futon. You can grab it right in the middle, or you can start on one side of the frame. Unfold a hidden third deck of a trifold futon, if necessary. Some trifold futons will have a hidden third part that needs to be pulled out before the futon can lay flat. Find this third section under the main seat and pull it out, adjusting the legs as necessary so that it\u2019s stable on the ground. If your trifold futon already has the third section (also called the ottoman feature) out, adjust the legs so that it\u2019s level with the middle section. You may have to release a locking mechanism in order for the bottom section to move. Adjust the top section of a trifold futon so it lays flat. This is the section where your back rests when the futon is upright. As you\u2019re pulling the ottoman section flat, you should begin to push down on the top section so that it lays flat as well. Adjust the top section\u2019s legs so that the futon is completely horizontal and stable. If you\u2019re having trouble adjusting or unlocking your trifold futon, go online and look up instructions for the specific brand\u2014not all trifold futons will work exactly the same. Lift the frame of a bifold futon up so that it unlocks. If you grabbed the middle of the frame, simply lift it up 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) until you hear it unlock from the base. You can also start at one side and lift an end up slightly to unlock that end before unlocking the opposite side. If you\u2019re unlocking each end separately, don\u2019t lift each one up too high before both are unlocked. Some futons will have a locking mechanism that you\u2019ll need to unlock before the futon can be lifted. This will be visible on the inside of the frame, near the legs. Walk backwards while pulling the bifold frame with you. Once the frame is unlocked from the base, lift it up and move backwards so that the frame expands to its full size. Start lowering the futon to the ground carefully and slowly. Adjust the legs of the futon, if necessary. Some legs of futons will automatically fall down into place, while others need to be adjusted manually. If the legs of your futon aren\u2019t stable, pull them out and adjust them so that the futon is in a bed position. Center the mattress on the frame.
