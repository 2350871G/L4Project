  "text":" Making the Cookies Place the unwrapped butter in a large bowl. Let them sit at room temperature for about an hour to soften. Add the sugar to the bowl, and cream the butter and sugar together. You may use an electric mixer or mix by hand with a wooden spoon. Beat in the eggs and vanilla extract. Adding the eggs one at a time will keep your kitchen the cleanest and help prevent a mess. Make sure the mixture is smooth and creamy. Mix the flour, the salt, and the baking soda together. Adding dry ingredients part by part will make it easier to mix. Also, mixing on a low setting at first will help to keep flour from flying every where. Wrap the bowl with plastic wrap then put it in the fridge for at least an hour.  Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F/200\u00baC.  Remove the dough from the fridge. Use your hands to form it into a big ball. You should also lay out a cookie sheet for your cookies. Read below on how to form the different types of cookie puppets. Make face cookie puppets: Roll one big ball about two inches (5cm) in diameter. Flatten it and stick a craft stick inside of it. Roll two smaller balls and flatten those on the sides to be ears. Make people cookie puppets: Use a cookie cutter to shape your person, then stick it with a craft stick. Alternatively, you could cut your own shapes with scissors. Put the cookies in the oven and set the timer for 6-12 minutes. You want them crisp, but not brown. Let the cookies cool for 15 minutes before decorating.  Making the Frosting In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and shortening until smooth.  Gradually mix in the milk and vanilla with an electric mixer until smooth and stiff, about 5 minutes.  Color with food coloring if desired.  Spread the frosting on all the cookies. This will make sure that the decorations stick. Decorating the Puppets Gather your decorations. Jimmies, cereal, colored sugar, dried fruit, nuts, edible food paint, edible pearls, and chocolate chips work great (just to name a few). Bring in the kids and let them make a masterpiece.  Finished.
