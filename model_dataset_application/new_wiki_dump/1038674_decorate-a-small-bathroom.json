You'll be amazed at what a difference clearing away even a small piece of furniture can make. If you absolutely must keep a dresser or small piece of furniture in your bathroom, try to maximize space by creating a second level of usage. For example, a small dresser can double as a vanity if you hang a mirror on the wall above it. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/cd\\/Decorate-a-Small-Bathroom-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Decorate-a-Small-Bathroom-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/cd\\/Decorate-a-Small-Bathroom-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Decorate-a-Small-Bathroom-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":334,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":552.2527472527472,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nIf you have a large clothes hamper that you prefer to keep in the bathroom, consider getting a cloth laundry bag instead. These take up much less space than large basket hampers. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/45\\/Decorate-a-Small-Bathroom-Step-6Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-459px-Decorate-a-Small-Bathroom-Step-6Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/45\\/Decorate-a-Small-Bathroom-Step-6Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-759px-Decorate-a-Small-Bathroom-Step-6Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":334,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":552.2527472527472,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Replace large bathroom fixtures with smaller ones. If you're prepared to spend some money to decorate your small bathroom, you may want to look into getting a smaller bathtub, or converting your bathtub to a shower that takes up less space. You could also get a smaller sink fixture to replace one that is large and bulky. Clearing Away Clutter Decorate sparingly. A small bathroom doesn't need too many decorations; your paint color, a pretty bathroom mirror, and a picture or two will be enough to create a functional, relaxing space. Avoid hanging large posters, light fixtures, or anything that sticks out from the wall too much. Throw away old toiletries. Do you hold onto once-used bottles of hair products that you hope may someday tame your frizz? Is the area under your bathroom sink crammed with 10 bottles of sunscreen and sticky bars of soap? Getting rid of these old products can clear up a lot of space and make your bathroom feel more comfortable. Collect the products you and your family actually use - not products you might use someday, but those you really need. Organize them in a basket or drawer so they're conveniently accessible. Donate or throw away products you haven't used in a few months. Consolidate mostly-empty bottles of shampoo, conditioner or body wash into one bottle, then toss the empties out. Pare down your bathroom appliances. That unsightly tangle of hair dryers, curling irons, straighteners, and other appliances is probably taking up too much space on your counter. Instead of leaving them sitting out all the time, find a box that fits them all. Store them in the box when you aren't using them, then place the box under the sink, on the shelf, or in another room. Keep items off the floor. Hanging up your towels, putting your clothes in the hamper, and keeping books and magazines on a shelf can make your bathroom appear to be more spacious. In addition, go for a thin, subtle bathmat instead of a big, fluffy one, which can make the floor appear cluttered and small.",
