Box sizes for mailing and shipping always correspond to the inner dimensions of the container. Measure the length: Hold a tape-measure or a measuring stick along the longest inner side of the box. Press the tip of the measure into one corner of the box, and stretch the tape along the length of the long side to the adjacent corner. Record the number where the non-zero end of the tape-measure meets the adjacent corner of the box. If the box is rectangular, you can assume that the other \"long\" side is the same length. Measure the width: Hold a tape-measure or a measuring stick along the shorter inner side of the box. Press the tip of the measure into one corner of the box, then stretch the tape across the short side to the adjacent corner. If the box is rectangular, you can assume that the other \"short\" side is the same length. If the width matches the length, then the box is square. Measure the depth: Press the tape-measure into the bottom of the box, along any side, and stretch the tape up to the open top of the box. Keep the tape perfectly parallel with the creases in the corners of the box, and record the number that sits where the tape measure meets the top edge of the box."
