These plants can continue to flower with less light as the days get shorter. In the late fall and early winter months many plants will lose their leaves and color. The landscape can begin to look grey and drab. As a result, you can add color to your yard through the use of autumn container gardens. The following plants will provide flowers well into the fall and come in a variety of colors:\nChrysanthemums. Pansies. Ornamental kale."

          "description":"When designing an autumn container garden, you can also add color using foliage. For instance, many non-flowering plant varieties will produce colorful leaves during the fall. These are excellent for autumn containers because they are often hardier plants that can survive the cold weather and also add texture and color to your garden. For example, heuchera has colorful fall foliage and works well in fall container gardens. Similarly, ornamental grasses in the autumn months can have an orange or purple hue to them that work well in container gardens. Avoid planting sweet potato vines or coleus. Despite the fact that they are an excellent color, they will not be able to survive the cold fall climate."

This is not necessarily true. There are a variety of vegetable plants that can continue to thrive even after the first frost. If you are interested in growing a fall vegetable container garden, consider these plants:\nGarlic: Can continue to grow throughout the winter and even survive during frosty weather conditions. Kale: Thrives in the fall and early winter months. Cannot survive the coldest winter climate, but will live through early winter. Turnips: Will continue to grow in a container garden through the winter as long as they are buried deep in the soil. Carrots: Will also grow during the winter as long as they are buried deep within a container for warmth."

You should also select plants that are a variety of heights. For instance, you do not want to plant all low bedding with no taller plants to add variety. Instead, you should look to include ground cover, taller plants, and maybe even a few plants that will hang over the edges of the container. For example, you could plant red chrysanthemums with some yellow ornamental grasses and green and purple heuchera. This will cover different height levels and will give an excellent pop of color to your home in the autumn months."

Instead, you should use fiberglass, iron, stone, or thick plaster containers that can stand up to the changing weather conditions. Many of these options are extremely heavy and may be difficult to move around. Try planting in a lightweight plastic container and then placing that inside your larger stone or iron containers. This will also make it easier for you to take out and switch plants between seasons."

For example, move into the corner of the front porch so that it is protected from the wind. Bring containers inside at night. If there is a sustained cold period, you may want to bring the containers in at night. This will protect your plants from the elements. Raise containers off the ground. For example, you can purchase a container that has pot feet, or place the container on bricks. This will aid with drainage and can help prevent the pot from cracking in the cold weather. Use a layer of mulch, such as straw, leaves, or wood chips, to protect and insulate the soil. Place a sheet or fabric over the plants. If you are experiencing a cold snap, you can give your plants added protection by covering them with an old sheet or piece of fabric."
