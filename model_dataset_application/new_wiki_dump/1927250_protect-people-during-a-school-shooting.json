          "description":"If you\u2019ve seen or heard of an active shooter at your school, run to the nearest classroom or office. Tell the teacher or administrator what you saw or heard, giving as much description as possible, and tell them that the school is at risk. The teacher or administrator will trigger your school\u2019s emergency procedures, which could be a lockdown or evacuation. Don\u2019t assume that they already know of the threat, even if it\u2019s causing a loud commotion. Speak calmly and seriously. It\u2019s very important that the teacher understands that the threat is serious and needs their attention right now. If your school has already made an announcement about the shooter, follow your teacher\u2019s instructions to evacuate or lock down. Stay alert and be aware that the shooter might appear at any time.Warning: Avoid pulling the fire alarm to trigger an evacuation or emergency response. This will bring people into the hallways and can put them in the shooter's line of fire, and will also put emergency officials in danger. Some schools have a bluepoint police alarm: pull that instead, as it will alert the police immediately."

You may be able to help first responders know where the shooter is and what they look like. Even if the shooting has already been reported, you may be able to provide new and crucial information about the shooter, especially if you saw them in person or knew where they were. Only make this call if you\u2019re safe from immediate danger. If you\u2019re running away or hiding with the shooter nearby, don\u2019t take the risk of slowing yourself down or exposing yourself to the shooter. Again, don\u2019t assume that the police have already been notified. Small but important steps like this can fall through the cracks during an emergency."

Don\u2019t hesitate, delay, or second-guess yourself. If you see others begin to panic, grab them and start pushing them towards the exit. Use your instincts and common sense to find a way out. If you see people running away from an exit, do the same--they are probably running from a threat. Use your knowledge of your school.

Turn the vibrations off if you can. You can also send texts to your family to let them know that you\u2019re safe, but don\u2019t call them. Ask them not to call you as well.

Only use the belt technique if you or a teacher can stand to the side of the door to keep the belt pulled tight, staying out of the way of any shots at the door. The shooter will be looking to do the most harm they can in the least amount of time.

Turn desks or large cabinets on their side and tell others to crouch behind them on the floor. Tell everyone to stay on their hands and knees, instead of pressing their chests to the floor. Ricocheting bullets tend to follow the path of the floor, so vital organs like your heart or stomach will be at risk if they\u2019re touching the ground.

Focusing on a plan can help you stay calm and think more clearly. If you want to evacuate, stay as quiet as possible and look for a backdoor or a window to escape through. If the shooter comes in, talk about throwing items like books or backpacks at them. You should also discuss how the group could take down the shooter physically, as a last resort.

Give at least one thing to each person and explain that they should throw it at the shooter if they come in. This may not seem like a great defense, but even the slightest distraction might throw the shooter off and save lives. It can also make your classmates feel better if they know they can defend themselves in some way."

If you believe you can help them inside without exposing yourself or others to the shooter, you can do so, but it may come at great risk. If you do let them in, open the door swiftly and decisively. There\u2019s no time for hesitation. Listen carefully in the hallway. If you don\u2019t hear gunshots for 10 or so minutes before someone asks to be let in, it\u2019s probably safe to quickly open the door. Be aware that the shooter may pretend to be a classmate to get you to let them in.
