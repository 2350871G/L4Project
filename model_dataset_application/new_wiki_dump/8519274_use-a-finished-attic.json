Add an in-home water feature or an elegant clock to the room to add a peaceful, regular background noise to the space. A white noise machine is an inexpensive way you can add soothing ambient noise to your attic. Purchase one of these at a general retailers, like Target or Walmart.

          "description":"Green rooms work especially well with attics that have a skylight or large windows. Plants lower blood pressure, raise work productivity, lower anxiety, increase attentiveness, reduce stress, and more. Buy plants at your local florist or nursery, repot them in a suitable pot, and place them around your attic. When purchasing plants for your green room, be sure you check the plant's care instructions. Each plant will have specific light, water, and soil requirements. Select plants that do not need much sunlight if you don\u2019t get a lot of natural light in the attic. You can also provide light to the plants with electric lamps."
