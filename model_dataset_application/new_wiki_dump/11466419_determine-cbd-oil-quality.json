          "headline":"Pick a full-spectrum CBD oil if you want the most effectiveness.",
          "description":"Full-spectrum oil contains other molecules and chemicals from the hemp plant, which usually gives the CBD oil a more prominent effect. Look around the label to see if it has either \u201cfull-spectrum\u201d or \u201cwhole-plant\u201d written on it so you know that it will work well for you. If you can\u2019t find the information on the label, then the oil may not work as well. Full-spectrum oils usually have a yellow, green, or brown color. Search the CBD oil online to see if the product website lists any additional information.Warning: Full-spectrum oils may contain trace amounts of THC and may show up on drug tests."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose an isolate oil if you want pure CBD.",
          "description":"Isolate oils are filtered to remove the other chemicals found in hemp so the CBD doesn\u2019t have any additional contaminants. Look for the term \u201cisolate\u201d or \u201cTHC-free\u201d on the packaging to determine if the product has other chemicals. Then check the ingredients listing to see if there are any other added chemicals besides the CBD. Isolate oils work well if you\u2019re frequently drug-tested since they don\u2019t contain THC. Isolate CBD oils may not be as effective as full-spectrum oil since they don\u2019t contain the other chemicals from hemp."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Check that the product has less than 0.3% THC.",
          "description":"Since CBD comes from hemp and marijuana, the oil may have small percentages of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the chemical that gives you a high. Make sure the THC content is clearly listed on the package label, or else it may be low-quality. Avoid buying any CBD oils if you aren\u2019t sure how much THC it has, since it could have negative effects. THC levels below 0.03% will not give you a high, so oils are still safe to use. If your CBD oil has higher than 0.3% THC content, then you could be charged for possession of marijuana if it\u2019s illegal in your area."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Read the nutritional label to see if it lists the ingredients.",
          "description":"Good-quality CBD companies are usually transparent with any additives they include with the CBD oil. Inspect the product packaging and search for a breakdown of how much of each ingredient is included in the oil. If you aren\u2019t able to easily find the CBD oil ingredients on the package, then the CBD oil may be of lower quality and should be avoided if you\u2019re able to. You can also try searching for the CBD oil online to see if the ingredients are broken down there. If the CBD oil doesn\u2019t have any nutritional information, then avoid the product entirely."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Calculate the price per milligram to see if it\u2019s over $0.05 USD.",
          "description":"Properly extracting and filtering CBD from hemp plants can be an expensive process, so high-quality oils will usually cost more. Check how many milligrams of oil are included in the package and divide it by the total price. If the cost equals less than $0.05 USD per milligram, then the oil is most likely low-quality and should be avoided. If it\u2019s over that price, then the CBD oil should be safe. For example, if you have a 1,000 mg container of CBD oil that costs $65 USD, then the equation would be 65/1,000 = $0.07 USD per milligram. The price may vary more depending on the concentration of the CBD oil as well."

First, see if the manufacturer lists the hemp source on the product label.

Some other countries also have processes for certifying CBD oil, such as the United Kingdom.

If the extraction method hasn\u2019t been listed on the oil\u2019s label, then check the manufacturer\u2019s website for details about their process. If you aren\u2019t able to determine how they extract CBD from hemp, avoid the oil since it may be unsafe to use.

Dial the number on the product\u2019s package or website so you can reach a representative. Ask questions about any information you weren\u2019t able to find on the package or concerns you have.
