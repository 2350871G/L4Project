          "description":"Lavender is a Mediterranean herb, so it thrives in hot, sunny locations. Choose a spot in your garden where the plant will receive full sun for at least 8 hours a day. The spot should also be as sheltered as possible to protect the plant from wind."

          "headline":"Make sure the soil has adequate drainage.",
          "description":"Dampness is the enemy of lavender, so your most important consideration should be to choose a location where the soil is well-drained. The soil should be light, fluffy and well-aerated for optimum lavender-growing conditions. To improve soil's drainage, you can mix in a little silica sand before planting. Silica sand offers many benefits: it drains well, does not cement, and is very reflective, which helps reflect sunlight onto the plant. This is especially helpful in colder and wetter climates. Alternatively, try planting your lavender on a raised bed, at the top of a slope or beside a wall to maximize drainage. If growing in a pot, consider setting the pot upon a bed of stones or gravel to optimize drainage"

          "headline":"Check the pH level of the soil.",
          "description":"Lavender grows best in slightly alkaline conditions, with an ideal soil pH level of between 6.7 to 7.3. You can test your soil's pH level using a commercial test probe. These are available for purchase at home improvement stores and garden centers. If necessary, you can increase the alkalinity of your soil by adding a little lime. The amount you add will depend on your type of soil and the test recommendations."

          "description":"There are many species of lavender available for home growing. Whether they flourish or fail will depend on the conditions in the area in which you live. The types of lavender sold at your local nursery or garden center will usually be compatible with your area's conditions, though you can check the label on the plant or ask a nursery employee if you are unsure. Munstead and Hidcote Lavender are two especially hardy varieties. While it is possible to grow lavender from seeds, this is not recommended as the seeds require scarification and chilling and can take nearly a month to germinate."

The hole should just be deep enough and wide enough to contain the roots when you spread them out. If you're planting the lavender in a pot or container, choose a very large pot \u2014 the root system for lavender is much larger than the actual plant."

Mix well, then cover this blend with a light layer of soil.

Good airflow is especially important if you live in a more humid climate."

Make sure the roots do not come in direct contact with the blend. Fill in any extra space around and above the lavender's roots with soil, lightly patting it into place around the base of the stems. If you're planting more than one lavender plant, leave about 36 inches (91.4 cm) between each plant. This will guarantee good air circulation and allow the lavender space to grow."

To achieve the proper level of watering, make sure that the soil dries between each watering; however the plant itself should not be allowed to become dehydrated. If you are growing lavender in a Northern climate, you will water the plant very sparingly until the summer, when temperatures can skyrocket and dry out the soil.

New growth looks like long, thin legs sprouting from the leafing branches. The plant will also begin to form blooms. This is also a good time to fertilize the plant.
