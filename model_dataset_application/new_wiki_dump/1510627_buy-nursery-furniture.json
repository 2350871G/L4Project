Older cribs may not be up to current safety standards. They also could be damaged or in disrepair. Make sure you purchase a new crib from a reputable merchant and that the date of manufacture is displayed on the shipping package. Decide on either a single function or convertible crib. A single function crib serves one purpose as a crib for your baby, while a convertible crib can transition into a toddler bed once the child grows. A single function crib will be cheaper initially, but a convertible crib can grow with your child and make the purchase a longer term investment. Consider a crib with an adjustable bed height. Many cribs are adjustable in height. This feature provides flexibility for both you and your child.

Do not purchase bumper pads, pillows, comforters, or toys for the crib. These all pose significant suffocation hazards for your child and should be completely avoided. Remember that nothing should go in the crib except for the baby. Buying a Glider or Rocking Chair Try a rocker or glider out before purchasing. The calming back-and-forth motion that a rocking chair or glider affords is a nice addition to any nursery. Make sure you take the time to visit a store and find one that\u2019s a good fit for you and your baby. Opt for a solid wood frame. When seeking out a rocking chair or glider, go for one that is constructed of solid wood. If your budget allows, go for a hardwood option like cherry or walnut.

Buying a Changing Table Choose a changing table with barriers on all four sides and a latching belt. If you have room in the nursery, you should purchase a changing table that offers a barrier on all sides. Your changing table should also include a latching belt to hold the baby in place. Try it before you buy it. If at all possible, you should test out a changing table in the store before deciding on a model to purchase. Consider your height alongside that of the table. You should also check that any cabinets or drawers are easy to access and completely functional. Use the changing pad that comes with the table. If the changing table you purchase comes with a changing pad, this is the pad you should use. It will likely be customized to work with that specific changing table as opposed to a pad you might buy separately.",
