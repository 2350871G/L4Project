          "description":"Although a determined intruder can get past a locked door, always lock your doors and windows. Additionally, check that the locks are working well and feel secure. This makes it harder for an intruder to enter your home. If you open a window to let in fresh air, don\u2019t leave that room unattended. Additionally, it\u2019s best not to leave your windows open when you\u2019re not at home or overnight.

Asher Smiley\t\t\tKrav Maga Instructor\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: One way to protect yourself in your home is to keep your doors and windows locked. Also, go to every room in your house and think about what you would do if someone broke in while you were in that room. Look at your options for fighting back\u2014what objects would work as a found weapon, or how would you access your firearm if you have one?"

          "headline":"Trim the vegetation around your home so intruders can\u2019t hide.",
          "description":"Thick vegetation and high bushes give possible intruders a place to hide, so it\u2019s easier for them to creep around your home. Prune the bushes and shrubbery around your home so that it doesn\u2019t get too thick. Additionally, manicure any vegetation in the area. You might think high bushes will cover your windows and hide your home. However, they also hide a prowler. If you have trees around your home, make sure they don\u2019t make it easy for intruders to crawl up to windows on the upper stories of your home."

          "description":"Burglars are looking for a house that has a lot of valuables. Don\u2019t let them see what they can steal from you. The best way to do this is to cover your windows with curtains or blinds. In addition, doing this can deter potential harassers (e.g. peeping toms and stalkers) from looking into your house. It\u2019s easier for them to see inside your home at night when the lights are on. Always shut your curtains after the sun goes down.Tip: Don\u2019t place your valuables in a spot that\u2019s easy to see through your windows. Thieves will be more likely to break in if they know you have nice items to steal."

          "headline":"Install outdoor lighting so there\u2019s nowhere for an intruder to hide.",
          "description":"Intruders don\u2019t want to be seen, so they\u2019re less likely to break in if the area around your home is well-lit. Use your porch light to keep the area around your door lit. Additionally, install outdoor floodlights on each side of your home. If you have a back door light, turn it on in the evening, as well. Consider the position of street lights around your home. They might help keep your home well-lit without you having to install as many outdoor lights.Tip: Motion-sensor lights are a great option because they\u2019ll come on if an intruder walks near your property. This might scare them away and could alert you that a prowler may be nearby."

          "headline":"Install a security camera at your front door or over your garage.",
          "description":"A camera may act as a deterrent for would-be criminals if they can see it. They don\u2019t want to get caught, so they might think twice about breaking into your home. If they do still break in, the police can use your camera footage to help catch them. In addition, if the home intruder gets prosecuted, your camera footage will automatically get him/her convicted in court and potentially send him/her to jail. For instance, you might install a visible camera over your garage as a deterrent. Additionally, you could install a video doorbell to document who comes to your door."

          "headline":"Replace your bedroom door with a heavy wooden door that locks.",
          "description":"Most interior doors are thin and easy to kick down. For extra protection, install a thick wooden door to keep your bedroom more secure. Make sure that the door has a strong lock. While an intruder could still get through, it will take them longer to get in, which gives you time to act. The door will give you more time to escape or call the police."

          "headline":"Get a home alarm to scare off intruders and alert authorities of danger.",
          "description":"If you can afford it, an alarm can give you peace of mind. The noise may scare off an intruder, and the alarm company will call for help on your behalf. Compare different alarm systems to find 1 that works for you. Most alarm companies give you a sign to put in your yard that shows you\u2019re protected. This can deter a potential intruder from choosing your home."

Then, take turns patrolling your neighborhood. Additionally, post a sign at the entrance to your street warning would-be intruders that you have a neighborhood watch. If your neighborhood already has a neighborhood watch program, reach out to the organizer to find out how you can join. Don\u2019t assume that someone you don\u2019t know is a criminal. It\u2019s possible that they recently moved in, are an invited guest, or are just passing through. If you\u2019re worried, call the police and let them talk to the person."

The best way to protect yourself from these individuals is to refuse to open the door. When they knock, pretend that you aren\u2019t home or tell them that you can\u2019t come to the door right now. It\u2019s easiest to just ignore the knocking. Monitor the situation until they leave the area so you know they\u2019re not prowling around your home. If you're expecting someone, ask the person to identify themself so you know it's the right person.Tip: Teach your children to never, ever open the door for someone they don\u2019t know.

This shows them that someone is home and prepared for a confrontation. Additionally, it makes it harder for them to hide. The lights might also flood the area outside, making the intruder feel very visible."

Then, call the police if you haven\u2019t already. You should still try to escape even if you might get hurt.

Load your gun, then prepare yourself to fire it. It\u2019s still a good idea to hide after you get your gun. The intruder may also have a gun, or they might try to take yours from you. It\u2019s difficult to know how you\u2019ll react when you\u2019re facing a threat.
