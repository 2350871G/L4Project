          "headline":"Ask yourself what your meal planning goals are.",
          "description":"Decide why you want to meal plan. Are you trying to eat healthier? Save money? Maybe you\u2019re running out to the grocery store 10 times a week, and that\u2019s starting to feel ridiculous. Knowing your primary motivations and goals can help guide which recipes you choose. For example, if you\u2019re trying to incorporate healthier meals, you\u2019ll likely want to look at health food blogs or balanced eating cookbooks for ideas. You might also want to choose certified organic produce, meat, and dairy products. If you\u2019re trying to save money, plan to do some coupon-clipping during your meal planning sessions. If you need less chaos in your life, consider adding 1-2 crockpot recipes to your weekly docket. These usually produce leftovers, and they can cook all day without you needing to lift a finger to check on them."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Check the weather for the week.",
          "description":"If some cold, crisp weather is forecast for your area, consider making a hearty stew. When the temperature\u2019s set to climb, you might prefer a shrimp salad and chilled soup. The season can also determine recipes based on which vegetables you\u2019d like to purchase. While everything you need will be available at the grocery store year-round, in-season options may be locally sourced and less expensive than out-of-season produce. You could also find in-season fruits and veggies at a farmers\u2019 market."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Make an online list to keep track of online recipes.",
          "description":"The Internet is a great resource for recipes. It allows you to search for recipes that fit your needs, whether those are healthy or gluten-free options or fall-themed meal ideas. Keeping track of all these options, however, can be tough. The easiest option is to sign up for a Pinterest account, download the Internet plug-in, and create a board dedicated to recipes. Pinterest\u2019s Internet plugin allows you to easily \u201cpin\u201d recipes you like to your board as you\u2019re browsing online. You can also create a Google Doc for your recipes. Cut and paste any links to recipes you love right into the doc!"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a binder and colored tabs for paper recipes and cookbooks.",
          "description":"You know you still want to break out your mom\u2019s treasured cookbook for those tried-and-true recipes. You may also prefer printing recipes off the Internet and storing them as hard copies. Mark which recipes you like in your cookbooks with Post-Its, writing a small note on the Post-It to jog your memory. Use binder tabs to organize printed recipes. There are several ways you can separate recipes in your binder, including:\nDedicating different sections to appetizer, entree, side, and dessert recipes. Organizing recipes by their level of difficulty, or whether they\u2019re \u201ceasy\u201d or \u201chard\u201d to prep. Filling a few sections with seasonal or holiday recipes."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Check with your family to make sure the recipes work.",
          "description":"You can even organize a weekly sit-down where all the members of your household pick out recipes together. Treat this like a fun way to discover new foods and dishes, rather than a chore. Remember, though, to add at least a few days of recipes you\u2019ve cooked before each week. Don\u2019t plan for a full week of new recipes. If you prefer to pick out the weekly recipes on your own, that works, too! Just double-check that what you\u2019ve got on the docket sounds good to everyone who\u2019s going to be at the table. Look for recipes throughout the week and finalize your choices on Friday."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Plan leftover and takeout nights.",
          "description":"Purposefully look for recipes that will make more food than you and your family can eat in 1 sitting. This will allow you to pack some away in the fridge for lunches or another dinner later in the week, cutting down on your prep and cooking work. It\u2019s also a good idea to plan to eat out once every week or every other week. Eating out gives you a much-needed break, and it also exposes you to new recipes! However, it will cause your weekly food costs to climb. If you\u2019re hoping to stick to a strict budget, try to only go out for special occasions. You might also consider having a few themed nights each week. For example, maybe every Tuesday is taco night, Wednesday is for crockpot meals, and Friday is pizza night. This, too, will simplify your planning."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a calendar to keep track of your weekly recipes.",
          "description":"This could be as simple as writing out the days of the week along with your chosen recipes on a piece of scrap paper and putting it on the fridge. You can also use a desk calendar or planner if you\u2019d like more permanent records of what you\u2019re eating from week to week. If you and your family members are tech-savvy, consider using Google Calendar. You can share this calendar with your family members and add reminders or lists to it if you\u2019d like. Then everyone can access it from their devices whenever they\u2019d like!"

        {
          "headline":"Make a list of all the ingredients you need.",
          "description":"Once you\u2019ve picked out your recipes, write down all the ingredients you need on a sheet of paper. Cross out the items you\u2019ve already got in your fridge or pantry. Make sure that you\u2019ve got enough of every ingredient you already have in your kitchen to cover all of your needs for the week."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Create your grocery list using your ingredient list.",
          "description":"Use a separate sheet of paper (or even an index card) to write down what you need at the store. Pair items by their location or type to make it easier to keep track of what\u2019s in your cart. For example, write down all the produce you need before moving on to the spices. Don\u2019t forget to add whatever weekly staples your family needs, as well. You don\u2019t want to run out of toilet paper on Wednesday morning and need to dash back out! It\u2019s a good idea to finish making your grocery list the night before your shopping trip. This will get you ready to go shopping the next day."

However, consider going to the grocery store right when it opens. The produce, meat, and fish will be fresher, and it won\u2019t be quite as packed as midday. You can also shop right before the store closes. Especially on the weekends, it won\u2019t be quite as crowded.

If you\u2019re in the store and can\u2019t remember if you\u2019ve run out, go ahead and make the purchase. Some essentials might be:\nOlive oil, as well as white and red wine vinegars.

Before you do that, make yourself prep whatever ingredients you can either right when you get back from the store or the next day. For example, you can:\n\nWash and chop vegetables and mince herbs. Be aware that some veggies may get a bit wilted after they\u2019ve been chopped. You can refresh them by soaking them in a bowl of cold water for 5-10 minutes before cooking with them.

Just be sure that your freezer doesn\u2019t become overstuffed, as it\u2019s easy to forget what you\u2019ve got in there! All food has different freezer expiration dates, which you can easily look up online. However, most items can last somewhere between 6 months to 1 year in the freezer. Take frozen meals out of the freezer about 2 days before you plan to eat them. This should give them plenty of time to thaw out."
