It's a color scheme that's classy without being overbearing, and you can find a wide variety of decor to fit this scheme. Mix neutral colors for a more interesting look. For instance, choose a black and white color palette or go with brown and tan."

For instance, you can choose a bright red if you also pick white trim and white accents to dampen the brightness a bit. Another option is a bright blue with white trim."

Try adding black accents or choose furniture that has black bases. Paint a single accent wall black for a sophisticated, formal look. Use matte paint and balance out the black with neutral-colored paint on the rest of the walls."

Let in natural light by picking sheer curtains or opening them during the day. Add track or recessed lighting for more brightness at night. Add pops of color with light blue pillows and gold picture frames, for instance. These items will fit with the light and airy theme will adding a fun touch."

For instance, with blue, you could add a soft burnt orange or yellow as accent colors. Similarly, if you choose a cool color like gray, warm it up with some deep red accents."

For instance, raspberry and fuchsia can give you that lovely pink color without the room looking tacky. Pair the pink with neutrals like brown or cream. If you prefer a paler pink, try a blush pink paired with both cream and white. The white helps offset the pink, while the cream helps give the look a more sophisticated feel. A little gray, in the form of curtains or rugs, can also help."

That way, the room feels put-together even if every piece of furniture isn't the same color. For instance, if you love sharp, clean lines, use modern furniture and sharp, geometric accents to carry that look throughout the room. To create an eclectic vibe, balance out various styles. For instance, use half modern items and half vintage items so the space is cohesive."

A coffee table with storage, such as one with drawers, is great for storing items you want out of sight but within reach."

For instance, you can start with cream walls and a cream-colored couch. Then add pops of color with pillows, throws, rugs, curtains, and other accents. If most of the room is done in neutrals, make the space more interesting by playing with different textures. For instance, add a jute rug, dimensional art, and textured pillows."

Another option is adding metal candle holders on a mantel or buffet."

Measure the dimensions of the room, as well as all major pieces of furniture. You can either draw items to scale on a piece of paper or use a computer program to do it for you. That way, you can see how pieces fit before moving them around. If you're drawing it out, cut out pieces of paper to size for each piece of furniture. That way, you can move them around more easily in the room you've created on paper.

For instance, you might place the sofa parallel along the rug, while placing nearby chairs at a diagonal angle to the rug. If you have a small space, don\u2019t put pieces diagonally as this can make the room seem even smaller."

Tuck a comfortable but fashionable chair into the corner with a good lamp. Add an ottoman and a basket of books to keep the space neat and tidy."
