A steam cleaner is a special type of mop that automatically fills with water and your chosen detergent. While steam cleaners are pricier, they tend to remove unseen bacteria better than a conventional mop and bucket. They may also remove set-in stains easier. If your floor is very messy, steam clean your floor with your chosen cleaner."

This will remove any dirt, debris, or hair that may get plastered to the floor during the mopping process. Run your vacuum over the floor, using the upholstery attachment to get into nooks and crannies. While vacuuming provides the most thorough cleaning, it's okay to use a broom and dustpan if you don't have a vacuum cleaner.

Then, sweep or vacuum the floor thoroughly. However, if you have a vacuum that works on hard surfaces, use that rather than a broom, because it will pick up and remove dirt, rather than just sweeping it into the air.\""
