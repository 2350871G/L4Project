  "text":" Basic Oven-Baked Bacon Start with a cold oven.  Place bacon slices on a broiler pan. Stretch the bacon out so it isn't folded or overlapped with other pieces of bacon. This will ensure that the bacon cooks evenly. If you'd like, you can line the bottom of your broiler pan with aluminum foil to make it easier to clean up the bacon drippings. Place the broiler pan in the oven and set the temperature to 400\u2109 (205\u2103). You could set the temperature as low as 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) or as high as 425\u00b0F (218\u00b0C).

At 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C), the bacon will be chewy and moderately crisp. Bake the bacon for 12-15 minutes on first side.

Depending on your oven temperature and texture preferences, this can take anywhere from 15 to 35 minutes total. Finished.  Candied Bacon Preheat the oven to 325\u2109 (160\u2103).  In a small bowl, combine the pepper and sugar with a whisk. Place the bacon in the bowl and toss with two forks until it is coated in the mixture. Lay the bacon slices on a baking sheet covered with aluminum foil. Sprinkle leftover sugar over the top of the bacon. Cover the bacon with another layer of aluminum foil. Take a second baking pan and lay it on top of the bacon. This will flatten the bacon flat as it cooks. If you don't have a second baking sheet that fits snugly into the first one, use another oven-safe pan or two. If you don't have aluminum foil, parchment paper will also work. Place the baking sheet in the oven and let the bacon cook for 15 minutes. Check the progress of the bacon by lifting the aluminum foil or parchment paper. If the bacon is brown and crispy, remove it from the oven. If the bacon is still pale and not crispy, let it continue cooking at the same temperature. Remove the bacon from the oven when it is brown and crispy.  Bacon-Wrapped Green Beans Preheat the oven to 400\u2109 (205\u2103).  Wash the green beans and cut off their tips. Lop off any brown or bruised spots. Place the beans in a large saucepan and fill it with water. Bring it to a boil and cook the beans until they are bright green and still crispy, about 8 minutes. In the meantime, place the bacon on a microwave-safe plate. Cook the bacon in the microwave for about a minute, or until it is partially cooked but not brown and crispy. Cut each piece of bacon in half using a knife or a kitchen scissors. Set the pieces aside on a plate. If you do not have a microwave, this step can also be completed in a skillet on the stove or in the oven. Remove the green beans from the stove and drain them. Use a paper towel to pat them dry. Grab a bunch of green beans and wrap a piece of bacon around it. Secure the bacon in place with a toothpick and set it on a plate. Continue bunching beans, wrapping them in bacon, and securing the bacon with toothpicks until all of the beans and bacon have been used. Mix the butter, soy sauce, garlic powder, pepper and brown sugar in a small bowl. Use a whisk to combine the ingredients well. Working one at a time, dip the green bean bunches into the sauce. Be sure to coat them on all sides. Lay the coated green bean bunches on a baking sheet or baking pan. Place the baking sheet or pan in the oven. Cook for 15 minutes, or until the bacon is brown and crispy. Remove from the oven and serve.",
