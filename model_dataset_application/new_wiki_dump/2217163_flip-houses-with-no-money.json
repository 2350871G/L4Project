          "description":"Flipping a house for profit involves a number of costs, including the home down payment, mortgage, interest payments, property taxes, real estate closing costs, inspections, permits, and contractors' fees. These costs add up quickly, and the flipped house might not sell at a profit. Before you decide whether to go ahead with flipping a house, you should ask yourself:\nWhat will you do if the house does not sell right away? Would it be possible to use the house as a rental property, for example? If you do not have a reasonable back-up plan if something goes wrong with the sale of the flipped house, you might want to reevaluate your plans. Are the potential profits worth the risk of a considerable loss? In 2015, houses priced below $50,000, saw negative returns. On the other hand, homes priced at $100,000 \u2013 $200,000, yielded an average gross return of 44%. Keep in mind that selling a house in which you have never lived might also involve heavy tax payments, which can lower your profit margin considerably. Can your investment partners weather the risk of a potential loss? Have you done your research on local real estate markets, remodeling costs, and permits? In order to have a successful house-flipping experience, you have to educate yourself on local home prices, school districts, responsible contractors, and real estate regulations."

          "description":"Sweat equity refers to the amount of value you might add to your home due to your own labor. For example, if you are a skilled roofer or licensed plumber, perhaps you can undertake some of the home repairs yourself. This will cut down on your overhead and reduce the amount of money you have to borrow. Be sure that you take into account the amount of time you'll spend working on the flipped house. Your time also has value, and flipping a house can sometimes take months of work. Consider whether other ways of spending your time might be more lucrative or more enjoyable. More importantly, will the partners putting up the financial stake consider that your sweat equity has any value? If so, how much value compared to their hard cash? Be sure to adhere to all local regulations when you undertake home repairs yourself. Discuss your plans with a real estate attorney or local regulations board if you require approval for any construction or repairs."

Before you begin the process of finding a lender and purchasing a house, it is wise for you to have a solid business plan in place. This plan should keep you on the right track for making a wise investment as well as provide confidence to your potential lenders and partners that you can make a profit. Your business plan should include:\nA maximum purchase price of the home that you will flip. A list of in-demand neighborhoods where you will target your search. Pay particular attention to school districts, neighborhood safety, and proximity to amenities such as shops and public transit. A maximum cost of repairs and remodels that you can afford. A list of dependable, affordable, licensed contractors who can undertake repairs successfully. A reasonable estimate for the After Repair Value (ARV) of the flipped home. Ideally, the initial sales price will be no more than 70% of the home's ARV. A sense of who your buyer is and what they want. Will your buyer likely be a retired couple? A young businessperson? A couple with children? Depending on the neighborhood, your potential buyers might want very different things out of a home. Consider who your likely buyer will be and what they might need out of their house. For example, if you are looking at flipping a home in a neighborhood with a great school district, you might consider a remodel that has young children in mind. A specific buyer. In some cases, you might be able to line up a buyer before you flip the house. In this case, your risks are much lower as are your overhead costs. A plan for how to repay your loan if something goes wrong. Do not flip a house unless you can meet your expenses, even if something were to go wrong with your sale. For example, you might have a buyer fall through, or you might discover a problem with the foundation of the home. Build in a margin for error in your business plan, and brainstorm possible ways to weather a delay in the sale of the home or unexpected expenses."

If you have good credit and a solid business plan, your bank might be able to provide you with a loan to purchase a house to flip. These interest rates will likely be higher than a typical mortgage with a 20% down payment, but they will likely be lower than many hard money loans. A bank is more likely to lend construction funds if you can provide a clear lien on the property. Discuss your business plan with your bank. If you have any hope of securing a bank loan, you will require a rock-solid business plan. Be sure to discuss your research with your bank to see if they consider you a worthwhile investment. Using Your Own Assets Evaluate your current assets. Even if you do not have a lot of liquid cash to flip a house, you might still have assets that can help you get lines of credit to purchase a low-cost home to flip. Examine your own home, your retirement accounts, and your credit lines to see if any of these can be tapped for a down payment. Tap your IRA. An IRA (Independent Retirement Account) is a retirement vehicle. There are serious tax penalties for withdrawing money before the age of 59.5. However, there are exceptions for first-time homebuyers. You can use up to $10,000 of your IRA to purchase a home. Discuss this option with your financial advisor to make sure that you are using the money properly and that you will not incur penalties. Keep in mind that withdrawing money from your IRA might hurt the long-term growth potential of this retirement account. Beware of the risks involved in diminishing your retirement accounts too early. Consider a Home Equity Line of Credit. A home equity line of credit (or HELOC) is a potential option for you if you already own a piece of property. A HELOC provides you with a fast source of cash, and you only have to pay interest on the money that you borrow from the HELOC. For example, you might have a HELOC that is worth $75,000. But if you borrow $10,000 of that amount, you only pay interest on the $10,000 amount. Be very careful with your HELOC: if you do not repay your loan in a timely way, you are in danger of losing your home. Be aware that HELOC interest rates might be higher than loans from private lenders. Consider using credit cards. Credit cards are another source of quick cash, as long as you plan on paying them off very quickly. The interest rates on credit cards can be very high at 18-20%. However, you are not placing any of your other assets at risk, as you would with a HELOC. You might consider using credit cards for lower-stake purchases during the flipping of a home, such as to purchase building materials from a home goods store.",
