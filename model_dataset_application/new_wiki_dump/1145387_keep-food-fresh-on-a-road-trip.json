          "description":"Things like deli meats, cheeses, pre-cooked hot dogs or sausages, fruits and vegetables, potato salad or pasta salad, and other premade and precooked items are good choices. Plan out easy-to-make breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals for each day of your trip and bring the necessary ingredients. Limit the amount of raw meats and other highly-perishable items to just what you plan on making in the first 1-2 days, since these foods will go bad the fastest. Things like sandwiches and wraps are easy to throw together on the road, and their ingredients will last a long time in your cooler."

          "description":"Chop things like fruits and vegetables so they are ready-to-eat and take up less space. Take things like raw meat out of its store packaging and separate it into portions to repackage in smaller containers or bags.Tip: In order to keep food fresh on a road trip, you will need a high-quality cooler. Choose one that is at least 2 in (5.1 cm) thick and made of molded plastic. It's also best to use 2 coolers, 1 for food and 1 for drinks. You can pre-make things like pasta salad, potato salad, baked beans, and other side dishes. You can also precook some chicken or other meat to use for sandwiches or wraps on the first day or two. If you are bringing condiments, put smaller amounts of them into smaller containers rather than bringing the whole bottle or other container."

Try to be as space-conscious as possible and pack things in bags and containers just big enough to hold them. This will save space and let you pack foods more tightly in your cooler to keep them colder. Don't put wet raw foods like fruits and vegetables in sealed packaging or they won't stay fresh. Either don't wash them before packing them, or let them air dry completely before you pack them up."

Leave just enough food unfrozen for the first day of meals of your road trip. You can also freeze things like fruits and vegetables that you won't eat right away to keep them fresh longer. It's ok to leave things like sealed deli meats and dairy products in the fridge instead of the freezer, as these items won't go bad as quickly."

You can do this with several personal-sized water bottles or fill a couple of larger bottles with water and freeze them to make bigger ice blocks. For example, 2-liter soda bottles or gallon milk jugs work well as ice blocks for large coolers. If you don't have or don't want to use water bottles, you can also use commercial ice packs or freeze some water in ziploc bags to make ice blocks."
