  "text":" Steps Gather your supplies, listed in the \"Things You'll Need\" section below.  Cut an 8-inch length of steel wire. Be careful when cutting the wire. It can fly up into your face. Wear eye protection. Measure 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) in from each end (leaving a one-inch segment in the center).  Bend the 3.5 inch (8.9 cm) segments at a 90 degree angle.  Measure 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the 90 degree bends.  Bend the wire around to the inside into a U shape.  Measure about a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) along the remaining ends.  Bend the remaining ends up at a 90-degree angle to form two \"prongs\".  Trim the vertical prongs to about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm).  Cut two pieces of cardboard 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 2 inches (5.1 cm) by \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) thick.  Insert the prongs in the cardboard so that they hold the cardboard strips vertically.  Cut a piece of aluminum foil twice as wide and 3 times as long as the tray.  Fold the foil over to form a 2-ply sheet.  Carefully push the foil into the tray to form a liner. Do not let the foil rip, as molten wax may escape. Fueling Method 1 (Wax Pieces) Put the wick assembly in the tray towards one end. Trim the wicks to just above the height of the tray rim.
