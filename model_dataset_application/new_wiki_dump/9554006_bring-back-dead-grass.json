          "description":"If smaller patches of your lawn are affected, use a trowel to dig up grass and soil at the patch\u2019s perimeter. Lift up 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil, and look for white, C-shaped grubs. If you see more than 5 grubs in a 1 square foot (0.093 m) area, apply an insecticide labelled for grubs.

          "description":"If you have circular patches of thin, brown grass and don\u2019t spot grubs beneath the surface, the issue is likely an infection. Clipping the affected area down to the soil will help prevent it from spreading. Water it less and only in the morning, since moisture that lingers overnight can encourage fungal growth. Collect clippings when you mow if you\u2019re dealing with a fungal infection. If the problem persists, apply a liquid fungicide. Read your product\u2019s instructions and apply the specified amount to affected areas. Depending on the product you use, you might need to use it again 2 to 4 weeks after the first application."

If you don\u2019t have water restrictions and are allowed to water your lawn, do so every 4 weeks at most. Hand or power rake to remove thatch, which is a layer of dead and decomposing grass that can block moisture. Mow regularly to keep grass blades between 2.5 and 3.5 inches (6.4 and 8.9 cm) tall. Sharpen your mower blades, as dull blades can leave jagged grass that\u2019s prone to browning. Don\u2019t collect clippings when you mow, since they\u2019ll help your lawn retain moisture. Once the drought passes and temperatures cool, brown grass will start to regenerate. Soak your lawn every few days in the morning, and apply fertilizer before the end of fall."

Once new grass has matured, water it with the same frequency as the rest of your lawn. The right watering schedule depends on your location. If you get a lot of rain, your lawn might not need any additional water. If conditions are dry, soak your lawn every 4 weeks.

Unroll the sod and cover the tilled patch completely. Soak fresh sod with water immediately and, for the first 2 weeks, water it thoroughly each morning to keep it moist. Sod is a good choice if it\u2019s later in the summer or early fall. Depending on your area, seeds won\u2019t germinate that late in the season, so you\u2019d have to deal with the dead patches for several months."
