The Common Furniture Beetle, which attacks the sapwood of hardwoods and softwoods, as well as plywood, is the most likely culprit. Evidence of Common Furniture Beetle woodworm includes exit holes in wood that are 1.5 to 2 mm (1/16 inch) in size, short tunnels than run along the grain of the wood, and lemon shaped pellets present in gritty bore dust.
