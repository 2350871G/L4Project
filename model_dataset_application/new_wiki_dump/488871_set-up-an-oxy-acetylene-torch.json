          "description":"If you have a cylinder cart, place both the oxygen and acetylene cylinders into it. If not, they should be securely fastened with a chain to a workbench, a wall, or a post. Cylinders should not be able to be knocked or pulled over. Cylinders should only be used and stored in the vertical position."

This will clear out any dust or dirt that may have settled in the valve. It needs to be cleaned out otherwise the debris might get into other parts of the torch and cause it to malfunction.

If the regulator and cylinder have different threads (meaning they don\u2019t fit into each other), you will need to use an adaptor, which can be purchased at any local hardware store."

          "description":"Don\u2019t assume because you have turned the nut as far as you can with your hand that it is tight enough. Use a wrench with a fixed opening (rather than an adjustable wrench) that is designed specifically for welding tools. You can buy these from a hardware store or a specific apparatus supplier. If you ever need to make an adjustment after the cylinder has been opened and used, make sure to close the cylinder valve before tightening the nut again."

          "headline":"Rotate the pressure-adjusting screw to the left until it turns freely.",
          "description":"Do this for each regulator. The valve in the regulator needs to be closed before cylinder pressure is admitted. Turning the pressure-adjusting screw counter-clockwise removes the pressure from the spring in the regulator. When the screw turns freely, you should be able to just tap it with your finger and see it move, rather than having to apply pressure."

          "headline":"Open the oxygen and the acetylene valves very slowly.",
          "description":"Make sure you can see the cylinder-pressure gauges, but don\u2019t stand directly in front of the valves. Open the valves slowly to protect yourself and your machine from any potential combustion. Open the oxygen valve very slightly at first and pause until the pressure gauge hand isn\u2019t moving any more before moving on to open the valve fully. The acetylene valve should never be opened more than 1 and 1/2 turns."

If it\u2019s on there, you\u2019ll be able to close the cylinder valve right away. In general, it\u2019s smart to work in an area where you can reach all your tools without having to search for them.

Most torches have 2 oxygen connections because 1 is used for the cutting jet and 1 is used for the preheat flames. If there isn\u2019t an adaptor on the torch that unites these 2 connections, you will need to use 2 oxygen hoses, 2 regulators, and 2 oxygen tanks.
