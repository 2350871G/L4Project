Refer to the list below to start eliminating tastes that are not of interest to you:\nChardonnay \u2013 Fruity and smooth-tasting. Chardonnay often features flavors of green apple, citrus, pineapple, and papaya. Pinot Grigio \u2013 Lighter and more dry than Chardonnay. Pinot Grigio is flavored with the taste of citrus, fresh pear, and melon. Riesling \u2013 Usually sweet, with fruity flavors. It is typically more bitter than Moscato. Moscato \u2013 Arguably the sweetest white wine, being a lighter-bodied white. It can act as a great accompaniment to brunch or to fruit-themed desserts. Fresh floral, ripe stone fruit, and exotic spice stand out as flavors in this wine. Sauvignon blanc \u2013 More dry than Chardonnay and very acidic. It includes tropical flavors."

'Body' refers to the perceived \u201cweight\u201d and viscosity of the sweet white wine. A full-bodied wine feels thick, coating the sides of a glass as you swirl it, while a light-bodied wine will behave almost like water."

If you're having strong goat cheese, pair with Sancerre, Sauvignon Blanc, or Pouilly-Fume. Smoked cheese is best paired with Gewurztraminer, Sauternes, or Shiraz. For blue cheese, try Sauternes, Banyuls, Port, Late harvest wines, Madeira, or Amarone."

Varietal wines are named after the primary grape variety that the wine was made from. Merlot, for instance, contains mostly Merlot grapes. Chardonnay uses chardonnay grapes from Burgundy. The grape flavor is similar to that of a green apple and makes for a crisp tasting wine. The Riesling grape can produce such a wide range of aromas, and is grown in northern Europe, and in parts of Australia and New Zealand. They have a sweet, sugary taste to them.

Wines that are associated with high levels of acidity include New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, Champagne, Loire Valley wines, such as Sancerre and Vouvray. White wines tend to be more acidic than reds. Cooler growing climates produce wines higher in tartaric and malic acid. A wine high in acidity that also emphasizes its flavor of sweetness will seem less acidic. A sweet white wine could thus be high in acidity without tasting sour."
