Pay attention to its flavor while it is in your mouth instead of quickly swallowing it. Calvados is typically served in a traditional balloon glass. Try to drink it in tulip shaped glassware that curves slightly inward at the top. When tasting Calvados, try to notice how the fruit forward, sweet flavors balance mellower flavors. See if you can taste bright, acidic flavors like fresh pears or subtle, smooth flavors like cinnamon, vanilla, or oak. Try and describe the flavors that you can identify."
