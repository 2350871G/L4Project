Caramelised onion adds a sweet nuttiness that can be overpowered by the capsicums / peppers so its more desirable to have the pungency of the onions stand out. Alternatively, you may add 1 generous teaspoon of curry powder (or more if desired to your tastes), which should be added when frying the onions and cooked until fragrant before the next stage. Ideally do not add the nutmeg as per the later stages, as the flavours don't match well."

Season well with nutmeg, salt and pepper and stir in the cream. You may also add some chopped Swiss chard or kale into the soup at the last minute to just cook the leaves which adds more flavour as well as boosts the nutrient content."
