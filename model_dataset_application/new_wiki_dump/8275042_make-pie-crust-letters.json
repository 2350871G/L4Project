To make about one pie\u2019s worth of dough, gather 2\u00bd  cups of all purpose flour, \u00bc teaspoon salt, 3 tablespoons white sugar, \u00bc cup vegetable shortening, 12 tablespoons cold, cubed butter, and \u00bc cup of ice water. Use a food processor to pulse the flour, salt, and sugar until mixed. Add the shortening and butter incrementally, until the mixture is crumbly. With the processor running, add the ice water one tablespoon at a time until a firm, consistent dough is produced. Press the dough into a ball or hockey puck shape. If you\u2019re preparing the dough ahead of time, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate."

Draw all of the letters you\u2019ll need on the paper to make sure you\u2019ll have enough room. Once finished, place the parchment paper on top of the dough with your markings facing up. Use an item with a thin point, like a skewer or toothpick, to gently trace the letters into the dough beneath the paper. Remove the paper and use a knife to carefully cut out each letter. You can also print a sheet of paper with whatever letters you wish and trace them onto the parchment paper. Always use parchment paper for tracing letters onto the dough, as it will stick to the dough much less than other types of paper.

Cut the strips into smaller pieces and attach them to one another to form letters, or simply twist and bend the strips. Store letters on parchment paper until you\u2019ve got as many as you need. For instance, to make a capital \u201cT\u201d, cut off two short pieces of the strip, one a bit longer than the other. Use the shorter piece to cross the top of the longer piece, and viola. When making letters with multiple small pieces of dough, brushing the letters with beaten eggs is especially important."
