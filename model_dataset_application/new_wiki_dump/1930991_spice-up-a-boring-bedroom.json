Eliminating excess is an essential component of making your space feel peaceful. Look to the cultural phenomenon, Marie Kondo, for her famous de-cluttering practices. Ask yourself what items in your bedroom truly give you joy. Put these items in a definitely keep pile. Make other piles to donate, to recycle, and to throw away. Make an immediate trip to the donation center so that you don\u2019t put it off. If there are any items you\u2019re unsure about giving up, box them up, date the box, and put them away in a closet. If you don\u2019t reach for any of them within six months, give the box away without even opening it. Include furniture. Does your furniture add to the space? If not, do you need it, and if so, do you have funds to find something else? If you have furniture you don't need, can you use it somewhere else in your home so you don't have to get rid of it?"

          "description":"After you\u2019ve de-cluttered, this is a guaranteed way to make your space feel fresh. Get to all the tasks you don\u2019t think about in your normal cleaning routine. Dust your baseboards, molding, and ceiling fans, and clean the glass of mirrors and windows. If you have curtains, take them down and wash them. Sweep and mop hardwood floors, and thoroughly vacuum carpet. Make sure to also clean under your bed. If you have furniture against your walls, move it a few inches so you can clean behind it. Use a magic eraser, like Mr. Clean\u2019s, to get any scuff marks off your walls. Wipe down all your furniture to remove any dust."

          "description":"If you compare effect to price, painting your room is an inexpensive way to make a drastic update to your space. Stick to more neutral colors that you won\u2019t grow to dislike over time. Shades of white work well in any space. White paint will make your room feel brighter and more open. It\u2019s a calming color and good backdrop to make decorations pop. If you want a little more drama in your space, try painting your walls a velvety black or navy blue. A darker room done right can feel cozy and timeless. Be wary of these colors, however, if your space already feels a little cramped. If you don\u2019t want to paint your entire room, paint an accent wall on the wall behind your bed. If you like your current paint color, just do a few touch-ups with a paintbrush or paint the trim white to help make the walls pop."

Choose a color scheme. Pick a neutral base and a few coordinating accent colors for decorations like coral, teal, and mustard yellow. When you are choosing items to bring to your room, refer back to see if they loosely fit this scheme. Think about how you want your space to feel. Do you want it to be minimalist, crisp, and bright, or cozily full of sweet, quirky items and various patterns? Do you want wood in your room or accents of metal? As you begin to update your space, think about whether the changes fit into your vision for the space. You can make a mood board using cut-out pictures from furniture and design magazines, or you can make one on the computer using images you find online."

Try to move your bed against a different wall, and reorganize your other furniture based on the placement of your bed. You don\u2019t have to place your bed against the wall.

Your headboard doesn\u2019t have to be a standard frame or hard headboard because it isn\u2019t structurally important to your bed. Consider hanging a piece of art: an oversized poster or a woven tapestry work well. You can even hang a woven rug on your wall as a tapestry. If you have a plush headboard, recover it. New fabric will give an instant face lift to your bed. Paint a mural above your bed or adorn it with wall decals. This will give you a more intricate image than you\u2019d get with a traditional headboard."

The more sources of lower wattage light you have in a room, the better. If you are able, install dimmers on your lights, so you can change the brightness of your lights. Keep practicality in mind. You\u2019ll need a lamp by your bedside, and you might want a stylish nightlight near your bathroom.

Feel free to mix a patterned quilt with different patterned pillows for a more textural look. Get new sheets. This is a small luxury that can make you more comfortable.

Choose a bright patterned rug if the rest of your space is fairly minimal. This is a great way to add art and whimsy without cluttering your walls. Add a soft, shag rug. These are great to put around your bed so that your feet will sink into them each morning as you get up."

Use large baskets and beautiful ceramic pots as decorative holders for your plants. If you have pets, make sure the plants you're using aren't poisonous to animals.

Try a plug-in scent diffuser and hide it behind a piece of furniture so it's not visible."
