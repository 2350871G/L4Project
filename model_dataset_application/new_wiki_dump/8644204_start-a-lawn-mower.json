          "description":"This step is especially important if this is your first time using a new lawn mower: check the oil and gas tanks and make sure that both have been filled properly, in accordance with the guidelines set out in the owner\u2019s manual. Lawn mowers run best off of fresh, clean unleaded gasoline. This can be the same as the type that you put in your vehicle. The gas should be at least 87 octane, and should not contain higher than 10% ethanol. Gasoline with higher ethanol levels is corrosive, attracts water, and can damage the interior of the lawn mower\u2019s gas tank."

This will channel gasoline into the mower\u2019s engine. If you\u2019re not sure which is the primer button, check for a diagram or schematic in the owner\u2019s manual.

Grasp this lever and pull it towards you, holding it against the top bar of the mower. You should be able to hold the lever and bar together in one hand. This lever needs to be in \u201cstarting\u201d position before you pull the starting cord. Also, in order for the lawn mower\u2019s motor to keep running, you\u2019ll need to keep holding this lever while you use the mower."

Hold onto this firmly, and give the starting cord a single smooth, long pull upward. Do not jerk or yank on the cord. Pull quickly until the cord has fully extended. If the mower has not started, repeat the process several times. Some models of lawn mower will have more than one handle attached to the starting cord. If this is the case with your model, hold both handles in one hand and use them both to pull forcefully on the starting cord."

Old gas which has been sitting in the gas tank for more than a couple of months can attract moisture and potentially corrode the gas tank.

When starting the engine, adjust the choke to restrict air from entering the engine. If the choke is manual, this setting should be clearly marked.
