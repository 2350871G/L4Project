Modern coins will include a date of issue printed on the front or back of the coin itself. They will probably also name the country of origin. If the information printed on the coin is printed in a language you can\u2019t read, consult a world coin reference book or website. These will include images that will help you match your coin. These guides can also be used to help you determine how old coins without a printed date are. If you cannot find the coin in a book due to lack of identifiers, try to determine general area (i.e. Sinosphere, Islamic Countries, Core African).
