You can always buy a few items that can work in several places around your home, and you can play around with them. Look for pieces that can work in your bedroom or your living room, or the bathroom or the kitchen. You can move things around and experiment. A metallic picture frame is a small touch that can add a lot to a space, but can also work in virtually any space. The same goes for metallic lamps, trays, bowls, and so on."

For example, consider using fun golds and silvers in your holiday or seasonal d\u00e9cor. You can find festive throw pillows, table settings, display trinkets, and so on. If you still love the metallic trend when the season or holiday ends, you can get some d\u00e9cor that is more permanent."

Whether it's a metallic tea tray on your coffee table or one metallic piece of art on your mantle, one statement piece will draw the eye immediately. You don't need to add metallics to every corner of the room to embrace this trend in your home."

Any metallic with an antiqued finish will look darker and older, and a metallic with a brushed finish will be more matte. If you\u2019re not interested in traditional gold or silver, don\u2019t overlook copper and bronze d\u00e9cor! Also, don\u2019t be afraid to mix and match metallics to create a lot of interest. Again, if you aren\u2019t sure which one you\u2019ll prefer over time in your home, try out a few smaller, temporary pieces! You can get an idea for your personal preference without committing to anything or shelling out a lot of cash. Don\u2019t buy a certain type of metallic simply because it\u2019s recommended with your color palette or someone suggested it. Choose a metallic that you personally love, and you won\u2019t get sick of it."

Instead of tossing that plain wooden dresser you\u2019re sick of, give it a makeover. A coat of black or white paint with some metallic knobs or accents will make it look like a whole new piece. The same goes for old chairs, tables, desks, and so on. You can find metallic spray paints in every hue at a home improvement store."

A vibrant gold bowl placed on a faux fur place mat creates a beautiful contrast. Adding a metallic throw pillow to a soft velvet armchair strikes that same balance. Not only do these pairings create balance, but they also allow the metallic element to really stand out."
