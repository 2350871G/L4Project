There are a few suggested upgrades that you should pick to make this game easier:\nDNA Gene - ATP Boost. This will give you extra DNA points at the beginning, which is essential for slowing down the cure. Travel Gene - Aquacyte. Basically required to infect difficult islands like Greenland, Iceland, and New Zealand. Evolution Gene - Sympto-Stasis. This will keep symptom costs low. Mutation Gene - Genetic Mimic. This slows the cure progression, which is important because the search for the cure starts immediately. Environment Gene - Extremophile. This boosts the infection rate in every environmental condition."
