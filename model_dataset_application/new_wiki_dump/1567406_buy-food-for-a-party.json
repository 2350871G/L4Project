If a guest\u2019s allergy is severe, you may not be able to serve certain foods at all. For less intense allergies, you can simply tell them what dishes have their allergen present.

Specify on the invitation that only appetizers will be served, so guests aren\u2019t thrown off when no main course is served. Estimate that guests will eat about 10 appetizers each.

Set out some chips and dip and a veggie platter and save your time for the main course. Plan for your guests to eat just a few handfuls of chips or a couple veggies each if you\u2019re serving a main course afterwards."

A fruit tray or veggie platter with carrots, cucumbers, and broccoli is an easy and colorful addition to your appetizer spread. For your fruit tray, aim for a mix of melons, like watermelon and cantaloupe, and berries, such as strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. Look for ripe fruit that\u2019s in season for the best tasting ingredients. Vegetable platters often include carrots, cucumbers, broccoli, jicama and cauliflower, and are typically paired with a ranch dip."

Choose a simpler, universally-appealing meal if there will be lots of kids in attendance. You can expect a small group of adults to be more flexible and willing to try new dishes. If there\u2019s just one or two kids in attendance, consider cooking them a separate, simpler dish, such as a grilled cheese or hot dog. This will give you more freedom to choose a main course just for the adults."

Consider the atmosphere you want at your dinner party to choose what kind of beef to serve. Each guest\u2019s portion size will depend on the amount of bones in the meat. For a boneless cut of meat, buy 4-5oz (115-140 g) per guest. For a cut with bones, such as steak or pork chop, estimate 5-8 oz (115-226 g) per person. And for meat with lots of bones, like ribs, buy 12-16 oz (340-454 g) per person. Mashed potatoes are a traditional favorite side for steak. For a healthier option, try roasted broccoli or brussel sprouts."

It\u2019s a great option for a party with lots of pescatarians, but make sure to serve with side dishes to make a more filling meal. Buy locally-caught fish for a cheaper, fresher option. You can get creative with fish side dishes, depending on the fish. Potatoes, salad, pasta or even bean salsa can pair very well many different kinds of fish."
