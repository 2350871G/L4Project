If an egg falls off of a spoon, that player needs to return to the start line and start over again. It\u2019s best to start out walking instead of running to ensure you keep your egg balanced. If you\u2019re playing with super young children, you can alter the rules so each player doesn\u2019t have to go all the way back to the start line if their egg falls."

Hard-boiled eggs are good for older kids and adults, and if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you could even use raw eggs.

This will take extra balancing skills and more focus! Use plastic spoons for easy cleanup, or regular metal kitchen spoons to make balancing the egg easier."

These new movements will make the race more difficult while also making it even more entertaining. Have each player walk backwards for an even trickier egg race. If your movements require moving on the ground or walking without being able to see where you\u2019re going, it\u2019s important to make sure the path is clear so there aren\u2019t any injuries."
