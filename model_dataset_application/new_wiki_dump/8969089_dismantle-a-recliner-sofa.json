  "text":" Releasing Locking Levers Tilt the sofa forward and lift the rear upholstery strip. Lift the sofa forward so the back faces straight up into the air. Many upholstered sofas have a detachable back panel that you can lift to expose the inner frame. Locate and unfasten the velcro strips or snaps that secure the fabric to the frame\u2019s base, then lift up the upholstered panel. Locate the rear locking levers. Check the frames on each side of the sofa\u2019s seats for the locking levers. At each side of the sofa\u2019s main body, around where the top of the arm and back join, you should see a metal lever pointing in a downward position. If your sofa has a center console, you should see levers on the frames between it and the seats. Feel for the locking levers between the rear seams. If your sofa doesn\u2019t have detachable strips of fabric that expose the frame, stick your hands into the rear seams on the sofa\u2019s left and right sides. Check the seams between the center console and seats, if any are present. Feel within the seams for the locking lever pointed in a down position. Lift the locking levers to release the seat backs. Use a flat head screwdriver or, in a pinch, your fingertips to loosen and raise each lever and release the seat backs. After unlocking the levers, return the sofa to its normal position and carefully lift the back out of its frame. If your sofa has a pair of seats divided by a center console, lift each individual seat and console back out of its housing. Removing Bolted Bars Turn the sofa over to locate the base bars. Lift the sofa onto its front side so its back faces straight up toward the ceiling. Look under the sofa to see if it has base bars.
