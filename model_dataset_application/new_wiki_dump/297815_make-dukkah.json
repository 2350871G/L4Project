The idea is to use the bread to dip in the olive oil of choice, then dip in the dukkah for additional flavour. This has become a popular choice at wine tasting events where olive oil is also on offer for tasting. Use to season. Dukkah makes an excellent seasoning for meats or fish fillets - apply to oiled meat prior to roasting, baking or frying or mix with flour for coating fish fillets."
