The simplest method for large items such as cucumber is cut them in half lengthwise, then making even cuts also lengthwise (not across the vegetable like normal slices), almost to the end, but leaving the product whole. Then using a flat knife, press gently on the sliced product applying pressure at an angle to fan out the slices. Gelatin products also make a fine basis or garnish. By mixing a heated flavoured liquid such as a savoury clear beef stock, herb infusion (much like making a tea) or sweet syrups, with ordinary gelatin (the pack would give a ratio of how much to add as the products do vary). They can be clear, coloured or opaque (with adding cream), poured onto a plate and chilled on the fridge to look like a clear mirror like lake, set in a mould or cut into cubes, diamonds etc to look like jewels. Bread makes a wide variety of garnishes, cubed, cut in diamonds or triangles (etc), shredded and these then fried or toasted in a low oven for colour, flavour and crispness. They can also be seasoned with cheese, spices, and over flavourings."
