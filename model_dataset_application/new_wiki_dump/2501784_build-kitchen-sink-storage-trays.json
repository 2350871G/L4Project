  "text":" Gather Supplies Take measurements before purchasing supplies. Measure the width of your kitchen base cabinet inside the frame. Also, take into consideration plumbing obstructions when taking measurements. Visit the hardware store to purchase supplies needed to create the drawers: A few sheets of 2 x 4 ft. pieces of plywood. You can also consider using softwood plywood too if necessary. Purchase ball-bearing side-mount drawer glides. Pick up two glides per drawer. Match your glides to tray sizes.

Pick up a hand saw, a few \u00be inch spacers, wood glue, electric drill and/or a nail gun to help you pull your project together. Create Tray Sections Create the side partitions by marking the base. Use a framing square to achieve the most accurate measurement. Also, when marking the plywood, look for the center of the sheet and mark down the middle so you have enough wood for two trays that are the same size. Cut the partitions using the hand saw and put aside. Attach partitions to the base. One of the easiest ways to join the two is to drill pilot holes into the wood before driving the screws.

Cut the parts for the trays and then glue and screw or nail them together. Careful measurements are vital during this step to ensure a symmetrical, even tray. Attach glides to partitions and side trays by aligning the glide edges to with the front of the partition. Use \u00be inch spacers to hold the drawer glides in place while you screw the glides to the partitions. Install Drawers Place the base assembly underneath cabinet and center carefully. Align the base flush with the back of the cabinet and screw to the floor of the cabinet. Create and then install the upper trays.
