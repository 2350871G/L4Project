      "headline":"Understand what headdresses are worth.",
      "description":"Decide which one you want before you begin trading for black longs so you know what your goal is. Keep in mind these rarities may change, so be sure you know exactly what each headdress is worth so that you don't overtrade. Go into lands like Brady's Lab in Temple of Zios, the Temple of Zios, etc. and see what the majority of people are accepting for their headdresses. Be sure to check the Animal Jam Worth Wiki to confirm what they are really worth however, as most people will ask for unfair overtrades. Below are the maximum worths of each headdress:\nRIM Headdress - 1 black long collar, 2 good long collars\nDark Pink Headdress - 4 black long collars, 2 good long collars\nTan Headdress - 5 black long collars\nOrange Headdress - 6 black long collars\nSilver and Green Headdress - 6 black long collars, 2 good long collars\nMagenta and Green Headdress - 7 black long collars\nBlack and Green Headdress - 8 black long collars\nBlue Headdress - 9 black long collars\nLight Pink Headdress - 14 black long collars"

      "headline":"Collect small but decent rares.",
      "description":"Continuously do adventures such as Return of the Phantoms and The Phantom Portal hard mode and collect decent rares such as worns, rare bows, and rare fox hats. These items can be obtained from both the animal passages and the actual prize chests. Be sure to choose the correct chests and not just chests with gems; the animal jam wiki can provide you with more information about these adventures so that you can choose the correct chests with possible items. Another technique to this is to have 2 friends join you in the hard mode of The Search for Greely and grind the adventure's 3 animal passages only over and over to get decent items quickly. You can also do this with backup accounts to get more items at once. If you're doing non member adventures, create 3 backup accounts which can join you in Return of the Phantoms Hard Mode, and when you pick a chest and get a good item from it, you can open that same chest on each of those accounts and get 4 of a good item at a time. If you get a bad item from one chest, try the next clothing chest on another account, and so forth until you get a good item. This way, you can get at most 2 to 4 of a good item from Return of the Phantoms Hard Mode through this technique."

      "headline":"Build up a beta den.",
      "description":"Save up your den betas and trade none. Use small items you have collected from various adventures to trade for den betas. Usually, 2 to 3 clothing betas, as they are called, can be traded for one den beta. Avoid den betas which are no longer rare or popular, such as walls and floors, sewing machines, and computers, or fakes such as non member nature items or giant plushies. Avoid trading your den betas and avoid overtrading. Trade for a variety of den betas since most people would rather accept a variety rather than a lot of the same den beta. Optionally, you may place these den betas inside of your den to keep organized and keep a count of each type of den beta you have."

      "headline":"Grind the Forgotten Desert if you are member.",
      "description":"The Forgotten Desert is a perfect way to begin gaining rarity on Animal Jam. Not only can you get small clothing betas, but you can also collect den betas, spikes, and other rares from the Forgotten Desert. Add these den betas to your beta collection and use extra rares earned to trade for more. However, if you get a few wrists, neon bows, black worns, or small spikes, keep those as they can enhance your trade since most Jammers enjoy variety in the trades they accept. Additionally, the Forgotten Desert can reward you spiked collars. Open ground chests. Do not believe myths about methods to get better prizes. They don't work. They are entirely coincidental. In fact, ground chests can reward you with spiked collars as well as worns, rare bows, etc. If you desire proof, you can find it on this page in the Other Prizes section. One way to get spikes quickly on the Forgotten Desert is to join adventures hosted by multiple different people instead of joining the adventures one person hosting multiple times in a row. This is because the system is unlikely to reward good items to the same person who hosts multiple times in a row. However, joining two adventures hosted by two different people can actually reward you with 2 long collars in a row, despite it being a rarity. Through this method, though, it is more common to be rewarded good items rather than from adventures hosted by the same person over and over. If you want to collect spikes quickly, do white and blue shards only and grind it. Keep in mind however it is possible for yellow to reward spikes, though it is very rare. That doesn't mean yellow doesn't reward longs however. If you're okay with missing out on spikes (i.e. you already have a decent amount of spikes), you can grind green and yellow and collect den betas easily."

    {
      "headline":"Trade for non member den betas.",
      "description":"A non member den beta is worth a member den beta and a clothing beta (rare bow, worn, etc). Not 2 member den betas as frequently believed. Non member den betas are preferable to member ones since they are of more valuable and they can be placed in the dens of both members and non members. Do not trade two member den betas for a non member one. This is a frequently believed myth and you can get scammed out of a lot of rarity by doing this. Aim to collect more non member den betas for member ones."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Trade for spikes with your den betas.",
      "description":"Spikes are a base item in the game and they can be used to trade for other rares such as headdresses. Be sure you have a large amount of den betas, preferably 20 or more, and try to have as many non member den betas as possible. Avoid any spikes smaller than purple or red longs. Go for red longs as they are normally preferable to blue or purple longs. Avoid trading for any longs lower than a red long and then trading those longs for higher longs. The reason for this is because if you trade 16 den betas for a pink long, which is its worth, and another 16 den betas for a second pink long, and then you trade those two longs for a red one, you're basically trading 32 den betas, which is trading way more than you need to. Instead, directly trade for a red long with just 20 den betas or a little bit over if need be. Keep in mind the worth of one non member den beta is 1.5 member den betas. This means that if you wanted to get a blue long, which is 20 member den betas, you would only have to trade 14 non member den betas to get it. However, rarely do people accept trades like these as most people just want overtrades for their items. If you're unable to negotiate with a person like this, have a backup of extra den betas or other good items that you set aside for over trades. Unfortunately, the game's rare system is not very stable, and unlike how it used to be, most people just want over trades rather than fair ones. This is why you should set aside extra items in case you need to overtrade for an important item. In the end, a blue long will bring you closer to a headdress than 20 non member den betas, since most people won't accept small base items like den betas and clothing betas for large-rarity items such as headdresses."

      "headline":"Trade for black long collars.",
      "description":"Once you have 3 red long collars, trade those and a bad to decent long collar's worth for a black long. Repeat this process until you have 2 or more black longs. If you're non member, continue to do adventures with backup accounts and stock up on small clothing betas while trading for den betas and spikes at the same time. If you're member, continue grinding the Forgotten Desert and trading for den betas and spikes."

      "headline":"Keep at least 3 black long collars in your inventory and begin trading for other items.",
      "description":"A lot of people want black longs only for their headdresses, but some do enjoy variety as well. Trade for items such as party hats, glossy cupid wings, founders' hats, or RIM headdresses, the least rare headdress. Keep in mind that many of these items are low demand. This means people aren't looking for these items as much as they used to, especially items like beta elf tails, tiki masks, and glossy cupid wings, and as a result, the established rarity for these items is actually false and they aren't of as much value because of low demand. They may be rare, but it's difficult to find someone who's looking for these items, let alone willing to accept them for their headdresses. It's best to stick with black longs only and trade them for headdresses, and if you find someone who is looking for variety, ask them what types of items they want and use some of your black longs to trade for those items. Then trade them for their headdress. To play it safe, wait till you have 3 black longs to keep in your inventory and then trade for variety if need be."

    {
      "headline":"Trade for your desired headdress.",
      "description":"Refer to the rarities of headdresses listed in the first step if need be. Once you've saved up the worth of the headdress you want, offer for it until your trade gets accepted. Don't undertrade - headdresses are going down, but it's rare to find someone who is willing to accept an undertrade unless they're desperate to get rid of their item. In a case like this, you can undertrade if the other person is fine with it, and profit. You may need to overtrade, but at most, 1 good long more than what the headdress is really worth is good enough. Don't overtrade by black longs - remember, headdresses are going down in rarity and their demand is lowering, so you may end up losing more rarity than you need to. Avoid overtrading for items, especially if the item is lowering in rarity or losing demand."
