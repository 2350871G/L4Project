          "description":"Gas grills are pretty easy to turn on and they take 10 minutes or so to heat up. Charcoal grills take about 20 minutes. It's best to use a chimney starter when lighting a charcoal grill as opposed to lighter fluid, since lighter fluid can impart a chemical flavor. Make sure the lid is open and when you're lighting the grill. Clean ashes from your charcoal grill before using it."

          "description":"When you've heated the grill, thoroughly scrub the grate with a brass-wire brush. Next, dip a paper towel in some canola or macadamia oil. Using a pair of tongs, grab the paper towel and rub it across the grate of the grill. You don't need to use a lot of oil. A small dab should do."

          "headline":"Sprinkle salt and pepper on your fillets.",
          "description":"It's all about personal preference when it comes to how much salt and pepper to season your fillets with. If you're unsure, 2 to 3 pinches of salt and 1 pinch of black pepper should do."
        },

          "headline":"Coat the fillets with a tablespoon of olive oil.",
          "description":"You can either use a spoon to drizzle the oil over the fillets or you can use a pastry brush to gently smear the oil across the surface of the fillets. No matter which method you use, try to make sure the whole fish is evenly coated with the oil."

          "headline":"Drizzle some lemon juice on a plate.",
          "description":"When the fish is finished on the grill, you'll be placing it on a plate. By putting some lemon juice on the plate, you'll add flavor to your bluefish. The lemon will easily soak into the cooked bluefish. There's no need to soak the plate in lemon juice. All you need is a small drizzle across the plate. You don't want your fish to taste completely like citrus."

        {
          "headline":"Place the fish on the grill skin side down and close the lid.",
          "description":"Cook the fish in the grill for 3 minutes without touching the lid. After 3 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, open the lid, and flip the fillets onto the flesh side. Close the lid again and cook the fillets for another 3 minutes for every inch of thickness in the fillets."

If the flakes don't separate, cook the fillets for another couple of minutes. Don't worry if the fillet breaks. The skin will hold it together so the fillet will still look intact when you serve it."

          "headline":"Season the fillets with herbs and serve.",

They will allow you to properly coat your bluefish. Containers like the ones you get from Chinese restaurants are perfect for this. They're very useful for a lot of other things too, so keep them around the next time you get Chinese takeout."

          "headline":"Place the fillets into the container with flour.",

Then flip each fillet over and cover the other side in flour too. Make sure both sides of each fillet are well covered before moving onto the next step. You can also use self-rising flour.

Some seafood restaurants will use evaporated milk to soak their seafood before they fry it. Evaporated milk is a bit thicker than other types of milk so it holds the breading in place better. You can just use any milk you have in the house."

It's up to you how much of the other seasonings you use. It's a good idea to use black pepper even if you decide to not use any of the other seasonings. If you want to add some spice to the bluefish, sprinkle some of your cayenne pepper on the fillets. You can use paprika as well to help add more flavor to the fillets and enhance their taste."

          "description":"Once you've added all of your seasonings to the fillets, place them into your container full of cornmeal. Make sure you have coated both sides of the fillets in cornmeal before moving onto the next step. Shake off any excess cornmeal when finished. Excess cornmeal will burn in the pan and ruin the taste of the cooking oil. This will ruin the taste of your bluefish fillets. You can also add your seasonings into the cornmeal container and season your fillets by rolling them around in the cornmeal."

Don't add all of your fillets at once. They need space to properly cook so don't crowd the pan. Fry 2 or 3 fillets at a time."
