Then, cut off the hard or \u201cwoody\u201d stems at the bottom. This part of the stem will be darker brown in color than the rest of the cream/white mushroom. Don\u2019t rinse the mushrooms until you are ready to cook them. When you store enoki mushrooms in the fridge, keep them away from water or other liquids as they will get slimy."

After the hour has passed, remove the kelp and discard it. Try to not brush off the white powder on the kelp as this is what adds flavor."

          "headline":"Add the miso paste, sriracha, garlic, oil, maple syrup, and salt.",
          "description":"You\u2019ll need \u20444  c (59 mL) of brown miso paste, \u20442 US tbsp (7.4 mL) of sriracha hot sauce, 1 chopped clove of garlic, 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of coconut oil, and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of maple syrup. Stir for 4-5 minutes to dissolve all the ingredients. If you don\u2019t have maple syrup, you can substitute \u20442 US tbsp (7.4 mL) of brown sugar. Sriracha can be substituted with \u20442 US tbsp (7.4 mL) of gochujang (Korean red paste). Sriracha generally has a little bit more heat than gochujang, but the gochujang has a deeper and more savory flavor to it. You can use 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of sesame oil instead of coconut oil. Sesame oil has a more distinct smell and flavor and generally gives a more \u201ctoasted\u201d flavor, whereas the coconut oil often isn\u2019t discernible in a dish."

This step softens the mushrooms and cabbage while giving all the flavors a chance to incorporate into each other. Cooking the mushrooms and cabbage for too long will eventually cause them to get rubbery, so don\u2019t leave the pot on the stove for too long!"

Turn off the burner unless you want to keep the soup heated for a while. If you do want to keep the soup warm, turn the burner down to low, and set a timer for 1 hour. Turn off the burner after the hour has passed and store the leftovers. This soup pairs well with sticky rice or tofu, too! Store leftover soup in the fridge for 1 week. Put leftovers into a glass dish or tupperware with a lid. Let the soup cool before transferring it to the fridge."

You may need to do this in 2 separate batches, depending on the size of your pan. Blanching stops enzyme actions that cause vegetables (or in this case, your mushrooms) from losing flavor, color, and texture.

You just want to heat the garlic enough to help it release its flavor, but you don\u2019t want to brown or burn it. Use a cooking spoon to stir the garlic and keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Burnt garlic really changes the flavor of a dish and makes it bitter. If you accidentally burn yours, rinse out your pan and start over."

This process marries the flavors of the soy sauce, sugar, and green onions. If you want, you can let the sauce sit for 2-3 minutes to thicken a little bit, or pour it immediately over your dish. If you aren\u2019t going to eat all of the mushrooms, set aside the ones you aren\u2019t going to eat and store them in an airtight container in the fridge before adding the sauce to the dish."

Feel free to top with extra green onion for a stronger flavor. For a brighter, fresher option, serve a simple salad on the side. You can save leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge, but keep in mind that they might get slimy from the sauce.
