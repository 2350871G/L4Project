Shift your fists (left towards your face, right away) so the dough rotates while stretching. When the dough has reached about 8 inches (20cm) in diameter, you can quickly move your left fist in an arc that goes backwards towards your face. Do this while twisting your right fist forward away from your face. If you give a a little push upwards with your right fist the dough will spin like a Frisbee. Practice how it feels to balance the force of the twists equally. Be sure to catch the falling, dough as gently as you can by lowering your fists as the pizza falls. If you notice that the dough is tearing, combine, kneed it again for 30 seconds, and start over."

Making Your Pizza Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).  Line an oven tray or sheet with oil, flour, or cornmeal. This will prevent the pizza from sticking to the tray when it is done. cornmeal, which is found at most supermarkets, is the classic \"restaurant style\" ingredient. If you are using a pizza stone, apply the cornmeal and then put the stone in the oven to pre-heat. Prepare your dough on a non-stick surface. If your pizza stone is pre-heating, put a little flour on the countertop and lay out your dough. If you are using a regular tray simply put your dough right on the surface. Spread a thin layer of sauce across your dough. Leave an inch of dough around the edge of the crust uncovered. Top the sauce with your cheese. Sprinkle your cheese blend evenly across the sauce. While mozzarella is the most frequent pizza cheese, try mixing in shredded Romano, Parmesan, provolone, Asiago, or a few dollops of Ricotta. Bake the pizza in the oven for 15 minutes.
