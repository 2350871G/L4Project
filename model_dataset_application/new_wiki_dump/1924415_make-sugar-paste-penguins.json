Beat the eggs in the stand mixer or with electric beaters on medium speed for about 10 seconds, or long enough to break up the egg whites. If you're using a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment to make the sugar paste. When you're making sugar paste, the dough will have to sit for 24 hours, so start this one to two days before you want to make your sugar paste penguins."

When you\u2019ve added the 6 cups of sugar, continue beating until it takes on the consistency of icing. Increase the speed of the mixer to medium and beat the mixture for two minutes, until the mixture starts to form soft peaks. The soft peak stage means the mixture will form peaks, but they\u2019ll melt back into the mixture within a couple seconds."

As the tylose is incorporated, it will thicken everything to a dough. Tylose powder is a food additive that\u2019s also called carboxymethylcellulose. It\u2019s used to make thick pastes that harden when they dry, which is why it\u2019s great for making sugar paste."

Transfer the mixture to the fridge and let it set overnight, about 12 hours. As the mixture sets, it will become thick and syrupy. This mixture will form an edible glue that you can use to attach different parts of the penguin to the body."

To make the penguins, you'll need black dough for the bodies, white dough for the stomachs and face, and orange dough for the beaks and feet. To divide the dough:\nCut the dough in half and set one half aside for the bodies. With the remaining dough, use your eye to divide the dough into thirds. Use a knife to notch the one-third divisions into the dough. Cut off one-third of the dough, and leave the remaining two-thirds intact.

When the dough has had 24 hours to relax, remove it from the fridge and let it warm up to room temperature.

Take the large half of dough and turn it out onto the oiled surface. Add about 10 drops of black food coloring, and gently knead the color into the dough. Knead in more food coloring in 10-drop increments until you achieve the desired intensity of black for the bodies. Color the orange dough. Clean off your work surface so there's no leftover sugar, oil, or coloring. Drizzle fresh oil on the surface. Turn out the small one-third section of dough, and knead five drops of orange food coloring into the dough. Knead in more color until you achieve the desired intensity for the beaks and feet. Assembling the Penguins Make the body. Remove enough sugar paste from the black dough to form a sphere with a one-inch (2.5-cm) diameter. Roll the dough into a ball, and then roll it into an oval to create the body of the penguin. Press the top and bottom of the oval to flatten them out. Flattening the top and bottom of the oval will give you a platform for the head and allow the penguin to stand. To make a larger penguin, increase the amount of dough you use to create the body, and use proportionally more dough to create the other body parts as well. Add the belly. Roll out the white sugar paste into a circle that\u2019s one-sixteenth inch (1.6 mm) thick. Use the cookie cutter to cut out an oval. Dip the decorating brush into the edible glue and coat one side of the oval with a thin layer of glue. Press the white oval onto the center of the black body and apply delicate pressure to secure the belly. If you don\u2019t have small cookie cutters, use a knife to cut out the oval. Shape the head and face. Remove some sugar paste from the black dough and roll it into a sphere with a half-inch (1.3-cm) diameter. To make the face, use the round cookie cutter and punch out a white circle from the white sugar paste. Use the brush to apply some edible glue to the face, and gently press the face onto the head. To make the eyes, apply two dots of edible marker to the penguin\u2019s head. If you don\u2019t have an edible marker, you can use two black sprinkles, sesame seeds, or tiny balls of black sugar paste instead. Make and attach the beak. Break off a pea-sized piece of orange dough. With your fingers, roll it into a teardrop shape. Gently flatten the teardrop between your fingers. At the wider end, flatten the curve a little so it will conform to the shape of the penguin\u2019s head. Dip the brush in the glue and apply a thin layer to the beak before pressing the beak gently onto the head. Center the beak below and between the two eyes. With your knife, cut a slit on either side of the beak to make it look like and upper and lower half. Attach the head. Apply a layer of glue to the bottom of the penguin\u2019s head. Gently press the head into the body, being careful not to squish the beak or alter the shape of the head or body. Shape and attach the wings. For the first wing, break off a piece of dough that\u2019s about the size of two peas. Roll the dough between your fingers to form it into a teardrop shape. Flatten the teardrop between your fingers. The rounded half will be the top of the wing. Apply some glue to the rounded half of the teardrop. Attach this end to the left side of the penguin\u2019s body where the head and body meet. Repeat for the right wing. Mold the feet and attach them to the body. Break off a piece of orange sugar paste that\u2019s about the size of two peas. Roll the ball into a teardrop shape, then flatten it with your finger. Apply some glue to the pointed end of the teardrop, and attach it to the body. Attach the foot to the front of the body, slightly left of center. Repeat with the right foot.",
