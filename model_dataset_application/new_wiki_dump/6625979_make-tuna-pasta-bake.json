Ideally, you should begin preheating the oven before poaching the tuna, boiling the pasta, or preparing the sauce. Doing so will ensure that the oven is ready for the tuna pasta bake by the time your other ingredients are finished."

Once bubbles and steam begin to appear, you can continue to the next step. You do not need to wait for the water to reach a full boil. Note that the poaching step is only necessary if you decide to work with fresh tuna steaks. If you use canned tuna, simply open the cans, drain the water or oil, and set the tuna aside until needed."

You can cook the tuna without the addition of lemon and thyme, but these seasonings will give the tuna more flavor and add more dimension to the finished tuna noodle bake."

Since the pasta will continue to cook while the dish bakes, you should not boil it to completion during this step. You can use nearly any type of short pasta for this recipe, but cooking times will vary depending on the type you choose. While you should always follow the package guidelines, the following cook times are typically accurate:Egg noodles, regular: 8 minutes\nEgg noodles, extra-wide: 10 minutes\nElbow macaroni: 8 minutes\nFarfalle: 13 minutes\nPenne: 9 minutes\nRigatoni: 12 minutes\nRotini: 8 minutes\nShells, medium: 9 minutes\nWagon wheels: 10 minutes\nZiti: 14 minutes"

Continue cooking the flour for an additional 1 minute, whisking constantly. This additional cook time is necessary to destroy the bitter taste of raw flour."
