Many Kitchenaid dishwashers have a separate button labeled \u201cControl Lock.\u201d If yours doesn\u2019t have this button, check the 4 Hour Delay button for the words \u201cControl Lock\u201d printed underneath it. These buttons will either be above or on top of the door, depending on the dishwasher model. Some other buttons to try include \u201cProscrub Upper\u201d and \u201cBottle Wash\u201d if your dishwasher has them. Mostly, though, Kitchenaid dishwashers use a control or delay button. If you\u2019re not sure what button controls the lock, refer to the owner\u2019s manual if you still have it. You could also search your dishwasher\u2019s model number online for more information."

Once the light turns off, you can set the dishwasher for a new wash cycle like you normally would. If you aren\u2019t sure which button controls the lock, try them all in succession. Hold each one down for at least 3 seconds to see if the control light responds. If one button doesn\u2019t work, try the next one. If you\u2019re certain you pressed the correct button but the lock still doesn\u2019t disengage, you may need to reset the control panel or call a technician to repair your dishwasher."

This means that the controls are locked, so you won\u2019t be able to change wash cycle settings while the dishwasher is operational. The control lock is useful for preventing anyone from changing the dishwasher settings during a wash cycle. However, it can also be easy to engage by accident. When you\u2019re ready to disengage the lock again, hold down the corresponding control lock button."

Flip the switch controlling power to your kitchen and dishwasher. After 1 minute passes, reactivate the power and try to run your dishwasher again. The fuse box or circuit breaker is often in the basement or garage. It could also be hidden in a closet or another out of the way spot. The fuse box and circuit breaker switches are usually labeled. If they aren\u2019t labeled, you could flip different switches until you find the one controlling your kitchen. Otherwise, use the big, main switch to shut off your home\u2019s electricity.
