      "headline":"Determine the Path of the Water Feature.",
      "description":"When mapping out the path of your water feature, consider bends in the stream and waterfall drops. A natural looking stream channel should appear \u201cageless,\u201d as if it has always been there. To best accomplish this, choose a location with a slope. If you don\u2019t have much of a slope to work with, as an alternative you can choose to create water flowing from a boulder or rock grouping. You can also create a subtle rise in elevation with a well planted landscape berm or rock out-croppings that blur the transition from flat to slope.Note: Make sure that the water feature is following the appropriate length and width determined by the selected system. It is crucial to follow the size restraints for sufficient water storage. To ensure accurate length and width during excavation you can use tools such as marking paint to mark the determined path. Select a Spot for the Filter Tank. In this installation the Filter Tank can be located remotely from the end of the water feature. In relation to the end, the top of the Filter Tank can be placed even with the ground level around the water feature (at grade) or it can be placed downhill from the water feature (below grade)\nChoose the Intake Route. The Filter Tank can be positioned as needed to avoid an obstacle, keep it out of the lawn, or be best aligned with additional water storage tanks. The intake route is that of the pipe between the Fixed Skimmer and the Filter Tank. With this type of system you can place the Filter Tank away from the water feature enabling you to customize your intake route to best fit your landscape.Common Intake Positioning: Intake routes for 4\u201d IPS pipe (up to 80 GPM) and 6\u201d IPS pipe (up to 200 GPM) can have the intake pipe run straight and level up to 50 feet (10ft less per bend)."

      "description":"Option 1: End in a stream. To end your water feature as shown below to the left, excavate 6\u201d deep at the same width as the stream. Option 2: End in a Vanishing pool. Excavate 9\u201d deep to allow a 3\u201d deep vanishing pool. If there is a waterfall above this, the length of this area should be at least 1-1/2 times the drop of the waterfall to contain the waterfall splash. For installations using the T390F Filter Tank, excavate 10\u201d deep to allow a 4\u201d deep vanishing pool."

Avoid a \u201cflying stream look\u201d where water runs over the surface or appears elevated without any aging or character. The following instruction is a general reference to keep the water flow within the stream channel and help you build a natural looking water feature. While excavated depths will vary with each installation, the excavated stream depth should never be less than 6\u201d deep. The excavated depth should increase where the stream drops. This will not only keep the flow of water within the stream, but also create the illusion that the water feature is a natural part of the landscape, not an addition to it."

Center the liner from top to bottom and from side to side. Don\u2019t be in a hurry to cut off the excess liner, as it can be trimmed later. Always allow a little extra liner to overhang the sides. Up to 6\u201d of excess liner can easily be folded under as the final rocks are being placed. Avoid making lateral folds that can traverse water over the side wall. Keep in mind that all water that laps or splashes against a sidewall must be able to flow back into the channel. Be very attentive to this when placing the rocks. Waterfall drops bunch and gather liner from the sides, so give yourself plenty of liner to work with in these areas."
