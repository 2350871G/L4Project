          "description":"Place your sprouts in a colander and clean them with cold water. Use a sharp knife to cut away the bottom of each sprout and peel away any hard or dry leaves on the outside. Finally, cut the brussels sprouts in half. The part of the sprouts that you are cutting away is the point where they would attach to the stem. Once removed from the stem, they tend to dry out and become quite bitter. You should only need to cut away around 1/2 centimeter (0.2in) to remove this unsavory part of the sprouts. When stripping away the hard or dry exterior leaves, you only need to remove enough to reveal a tight head of leaves on the inside. As with the base, these exterior leaves are more tough and bitter, so you should remove them to reveal the fresher leaves beneath. Cutting the sprouts in half reveals a larger surface area, giving more room for caramelization and extra flavor to be imparted."

          "description":"Bring a pot of salted water to the boil and add your brussels sprouts. Let them cook for around 3 minutes, just enough to make them tender without removing all of their natural flavors. Pour the sprouts through the colander and submerge them in cold water to stop the cooking process. Blanching any sort of vegetable is a great way to cook them without removing too much of the color and crispness of a fresh vegetable."

          "description":"While your sprouts cool down in the cold water, preheat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon (15g) of butter to the frying pan and let it melt and sizzle slightly. For extra flavor, you can use 1 tablespoon of bacon or duck fat instead of the butter. You could also use 1 tablespoon (15ml) of olive oil instead."

          "headline":"Dice 2 shallots and cook them for 4 to 5 minutes.",
          "description":"Cut your shallots in half and place them on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to dice the shallots finely into small pieces, discarding the root end and adding the diced shallots into the frying pan. Let the shallots cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until soft. If you don\u2019t have 2 shallots on hand, you can use 1 red onion instead as a substitute. Alternately, if you don\u2019t like onion or shallots, you can leave them out and cook your sprouts by themselves. The shallots add flavor but aren\u2019t an integral part of caramelizing your brussels sprouts. Red onions and shallots will be sweeter and milder than brown or white onions. Anything other"

          "description":"Strain your brussels sprouts from the cold water and add them directly to the frying pan. Use a wooden spoon to stir them around slightly so they are coated in the butter and shallot before turning the temperature up to high. Keep your sprouts moving as they cook for around 5 minutes, or until they begin to caramelize. By turning the heat to high, you are essentially stir-frying the brussels sprouts. This will keep them fresh and crisp while adding some color and flavor to them. For extra caramelization, try adding 1 tablespoon (12g) of brown sugar to the pan just before adding the sprouts."

          "headline":"Season your brussels sprouts.",
          "description":"Once the sprouts are caramelized and cooked, take them off the heat. Pour over 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of lemon juice and toss the sprouts around to coat them. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. As with the shallots, this isn\u2019t an essential part of caramelizing but will make your caramelized sprouts taste even better. 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of lemon juice is approximately the juice of half a lemon. Serve your caramelized sprouts immediately. Brussels sprouts are best eaten fresh from the stove while they are still hot. Transfer the sprouts to a serving dish and enjoy them as soon as possible. For extra flavor and a hint of extra freshness and color, sprinkle some freshly chopped parsley over the sprouts just before serving."
