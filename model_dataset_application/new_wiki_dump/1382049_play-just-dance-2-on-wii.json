      "description":"Pick a song you like, or one that looks cool. There are many songs to choose from. If you are playing with more than one person, press A on a remote to add you. You'll start to play. All you have to do is copy the person dancing. It's not difficult at all. Many times the moves are simple hand motions, or spinning, or something like that. Also, the moves repeat themselves many times. To know when to change moves, a small person will appear at the bottom of the screen showing you the next move. Leg and foot motions are not required, because the Wii Remote can only sense your hand.

      "description":"The goal is to get the most points. At each move, you can get an \"X\", an \"OK\", a \"Good\", or a \"Perfect\". An X means you didn't really get the move. OK means you're not quite there, but you tried. Good means almost there! And perfect means you did an awesome job on the move. Some moves, represented with golden pictograms at the bottom, are called \"Gold Moves\". Every song has at least one, and many songs have several gold moves. A gold move is a special dance move, and it may or may not be harder than a regular move. Gold Moves only have two scorings, depending on whether or not you perform the move properly: \"YEAH!\" and \"X\". If you get a \"YEAH! \", you'll get lots of points, so pay attention when they come up!"
