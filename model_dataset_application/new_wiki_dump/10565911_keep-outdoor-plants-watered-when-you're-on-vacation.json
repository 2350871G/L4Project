You can find plant fertilizer at your local gardening supply store. Use a granular fertilizer for your garden and a liquid fertilizer for potted plants. You can also use organic matter to fertilize your plants, like manure or compost."

Next, cut out older growth and trim the plant into a particular shape if you prefer. Do this about a week or so before you leave. Be sure to trim only the very well-established plants in your garden."

          "description":"Purchase organic mulch online or in a gardening store for best results. Apply the mulch to your garden by layering about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of mulch around the plants to help them retain more water while you are gone. Use this technique in conjunction with another watering method. Don\u2019t leave the mulch in your garden untouched for more than a couple of weeks or it will introduce rot. Adding mulch in this way is a temporary measure for when you are on vacation only. Make your own mulch by shredding leaves, twigs, and other organic matter from your yard. Don\u2019t forget to mulch your potted plants, too. Simply add layers of heavily watered peat moss to the pot. A moist rag wrapped loosely around the base of your plant also works."

You can also find a plant-savvy friend or neighbor. Consider offering to water their plants when they are on vacation in exchange. Even a conscientious friend or neighbor who doesn\u2019t have plant experience can help water your plants.

          "description":"If you\u2019ll only be gone a few days or a week, move your plants into a cool place away from the sun, such as a shady area of your deck or your garage. Place drip pans under the plants and water them extra well. Unless there is a heat wave while you are gone, they should be fine. Insulate the plants even more by double potting them. Place each pot into a larger pot, then fill the space between them with soil or fine mulch."

          "description":"Buy a ready-to-use terrarium for your plants, or make your own. To do this, place a clear plastic bag in a cool area out of direct sunlight. Lay a moist towel along the bottom of the bag. Place as many potted plants inside as you can fit. Then, pull the sides of the bags up and over the top of the plants. Blow some air into the bag so it puffs up. Finally, twist the top of the bag shut and secure it with a rubber band. Because the plants will release water and the excess will drip back down to feed their roots, your plants can live happily in their greenhouse for months. Remember to keep your mini-greenhouse out of direct sunlight or it will heat up your plants too much and could kill them."

Insert the neck of the bottle into the soil next to your plant. Fill the bottle with water the day before you leave and top it up once again on your way out. The plant will take in water from the bottle as needed while you\u2019re away. Depending on how much water the plant consumes, you can use this method for up to 1 week. For smaller pots, use smaller plastic bottles or cough syrup bottles."

The water flows down from the bulb when the soil becomes dry. They are not only quite effective, but they also come in lots of different colors and shapes, so you can use them as permanent decoration in your garden. You can find watering bulbs at your local gardening store or online. They can provide water to small plants for up to 2 weeks. To prevent the watering bulb from getting clogged with dirt, secure some cheesecloth on the tip with a small rubber band before you insert it into the soil."

You can use a large basin or other container, or move your plants into your bathtub. Be sure that your container is in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Standing water can attract various insects. If you will be gone for more than a week, spray the container with a plant-friendly mold and bug deterrent. Make your own by mixing 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of 3% hydrogen peroxide with 1 cup (240 ml) of water and 3 drops of dish soap.

To find the right schedule, first monitor exactly how much water you give each area of your garden in one week. Then, place small cans in different parts of your garden and run the sprinklers for 10 minutes. Measure how much water was collected in each can. The individual sprinkler heads can be programmed on different schedules to accommodate the different watering needs of your plants. If your sprinkler system does not have a rain sensor, you may want to entrust a friend or neighbor to manually turn off the sprinkler system in case it rains while you are away. Otherwise, the sprinkler will still run when it\u2019s raining and will overwater your plants."

Place 1 end of your wicking material in the water, making sure it reaches all the way to the bottom of the container. Put the other end about 3 inches (7.6 cm) into the plant\u2019s soil. When the soil gets dry, the water will travel up the wicking material to replenish the moisture. Large bottles, bowls, or pails work well as containers. Insert 1 wick into every plant. You can use the same container of water for several nearby plants. Be sure your wicking system is working before you leave. Sometimes the wicks don\u2019t work effectively and you\u2019ll have to switch them out for new ones. Put the wicking system together and test it for at least a week before you leave. If you are having trouble getting the water to wick properly, try positioning the container of water higher than the plant and use a shorter wick. Some plants, such as cactus or succulents, grow best when their soil dries out completely between waterings. Watering these plants with a wicking system is not recommended."
