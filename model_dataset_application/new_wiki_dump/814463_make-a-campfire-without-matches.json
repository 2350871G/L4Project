  "text":" Steps Understand the value of tinder. When you don't have matches or a reliable source of flame, tinder is essential for starting a fire with one of the suggested methods below. Tinder consists of very fine, very dry plant material, piled into a loose heap in the fire pit. Tinder must be very dry\u2013\u2013there is no way of getting around this. Suitable types of tinder include:\nBark, coniferous pitch, lint, punk (the insides of rotting tree trunks), shaved resin, dead and dry leaves, crushed dead and dry leaves, bird's nests, dry grasses, etc. If you have alcohol or fuel, these can be used to saturate the tinder and make it more susceptible to burning. Once tinder catches and begins to smolder, help it along. Blow on it gently or fan it until it turns into a strong flame. Once this happens, you can slowly start to feed the kindling onto the fire, followed by the wood fuel last. Steel wool and battery firestarter Find some twigs and dried leaves to put in fire pit. The tinder should be prepare before starting, along with having a healthy pile of kindling and wood fuel ready. Take a large D battery. Strike it against some steel wool. When steel wool is ignited, gently put it into fire pit with the twigs and leaves. Once the tinder and kindling takes, you can add larger logs to the fire. Tend to the fire. Now you will be warm and safe, and able to cook that delicious campfire meal. Using a fire plow Prepare the tinder. Find some and set it up in the fire pit, in readiness for burning. Also have a pile of kindling and wood fuel ready to throw on the fire progressively, as the fire takes hold properly. Cut a groove into a soft piece of wood. This wood serves as the base board. Find a piece of hardwood to use as a shaft. It might be a strong stick or whittled down branch; old fence posts, chair legs, etc. might work too. Push the hardwood shaft up and down the groove. Do this faster and faster; eventually the friction will produce a fire, and this will ignite your pre-made pile of tinder. Using a fire saw Prepare the tinder. Find some and set it up in the fire pit, in readiness for burning. Also have a pile of kindling and wood fuel ready to throw on the fire progressively, as the fire takes hold properly. Find two pieces of very dry wood. Anchor one piece of wood on the ground so that it cannot move; perhaps push it up against a rock or a log. The rubbing stick is best softer than the piece used as an anchor. Rub the other piece of wood vigorously against the anchored piece of wood.  Continue rubbing until a spark is produced. Light the tinder immediately. Using the matches case Prepare the tinder. Find some and set it up in the fire pit, in readiness for burning. Also have a pile of kindling and wood fuel ready to throw on the fire progressively, as the fire takes hold properly. Find a carbon steel knife. Or, if you have some other carbon steel, that will work too. Locate the flint on the base of the waterproof matchbox. Hold this end right down near the tinder pile. Strike the flint section with the back of the knife. Do not strike with the blade. Strike down in the direction of the tinder; that way, the sparks will go straight down into the tinder and, with any luck, catch.",
