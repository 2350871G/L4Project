Sweet snacks cause blood sugar levels to rise and fall, which could cause your child to wake up hungry a couple hours after bedtime. Other protein-carb combo snacks include hummus and crackers, peanut butter toast, and cheese and fruit slices."

Go for unsalted nuts to avoid adding too much sodium to your child's diet. Cashews contain lots of magnesium, which makes them an even more appealing bedtime snack. Magnesium deficiency is linked to sleep disorders like restless leg syndrome and muscle cramps."

Heat milk in the microwave or in a double broiler until it begins to steam but not scald or boil. Your child might also find warm milk soothing, so it could help them relax before at bedtime. Make sure they brush their teeth before going to sleep, even if they\u2019ve just had a glass of milk. Going to sleep after drinking anything except water can result in tooth decay."
