If the house catches fire in the middle of the night you will need to escape quickly and may have to walk over broken glass. Keep a loaded firearm within a reasonable distance of your bed or any place you spend the greatest amount of time. If the gun is not near you 90% of the time you are home, make sure it is locked up. There are a number of easily accessible lockable safes on the market."

Hold the flashlight as far away from you in your left hand as is comfortable. Make sure you hold it away from you because statistically shots are fired at flashlights in low light situations."

      "headline":"Invest your time in securing your home and making your home less of a target.",
      "description":"Set up motion sensor lights on your front porch, side yards, back yards etc. The bad guy doesn\u2019t want to be seen. The light also allows you to identify where the bad is or has recently been. A dog would be another good investment. Locks: a solid deadbolt is not a foolproof lock mechanism, but they are very worthwhile and helpful. Doors: Solid core wood doors are a minimum and a very poor one at that. Metal doors with insulated inserts are best for the average home perimeter doors. If I can take a hole saw and cut out the lock on your wooden door in the time it takes Fido to bark and your wife to wake you I am coming in and having my way. Get the picture? Windows: They break! Windows will be the weakest point on your perimeter. You can invest in better stronger windows that are a little more durable and won\u2019t come out of the track from the outside. Find ones that you cannot manipulate from the outside. Security Doors: Along with not being cosmetically appealing they are also not full proof. A pry bar near the locking mechanism will allow for easy access to your front door. Alarm Systems: Again they are nice but not foolproof. A power outage will revert your alarm to battery back up. If the cable from your panel to the service center is cut and the audible function is cut and now you have an alarm that is going off an no one knows. Private Security: Probably worth the cost when it comes to one house. Now if you and the neighborhood want to go in on this together then it might work. You have to think of the intricacies of a piece of property. Trees, shrubs, rocks, telephone poles, fences, cars etc. are all going to block the line of sight from the rent-a-cop to your bad guy. Besides the point If the bad guy is walking down the street and hasn't committed a crime yet the only thing the security guard can do is call the real police, that being said the rent-a-cop is pretty much not worth having at your home. Ultimate Security System: Buy a dog, preferably a German Sheppard or another large breed known for being fiercely loyal. Dogs do not fail during power outages, cannot be deactivated by experienced crooks, generally provide advanced warning of thieves, and don't have a 10 minute response time. You'll never regret that particular investment. Neighborhood Watch: this is probably the best advancement in home security in a long time. A strong bond with your neighbors will have a detrimental effect on burglaries/robberies in your area. Jim and Sandy go out and walk the dog at 830 and everything is fine and on their way home at 9:00 they notice a van with two adult males in your driveway is a great advantage to you. Yard Care: Keep your home free from shrubs and trees that block the view of windows. You don\u2019t want to have a broken window that the neighbor or passing police officer can\u2019t see. Keep the shrubbery away from the house by about 2 feet (0.6 m). You want to be able to see the perimeter of your home very clearly. Keep shrubbery under two feet in height and tree limbs above 7 feet (2.1 m). this will allow for a \"window\" of your home to be seen from the street. The same for your back yard only a little different with your fence. A lot of people like shrubbery around the fence. I don\u2019t agree with this. You need to keep shrubbery at a minimum height of 18in off of the ground to allow you to see the fence behind it clearly. Try to keep shrubbery off of the fence the same way as the house. Housekeeping: Some people are filthy. Don\u2019t be one of them. Keeping your home tidy and clean may prove more useful than not. If you have kid\u2019s toys and shoes and clutter all over your floor and you are trying to move your family to safety in the dark everyone will trip and fall. Eliminate this by keeping the house tidy. Safe Room: These aren\u2019t just in the movies. You can make your own very easily. Pick a room that has no obstructions like alternate entry exits. Make sure you can fit your family in it. Your master bedroom walk-in closet will be more practical than the coat closet in the hallway. Invest the money in a solid core door and a deadbolt. Make sure the light switch is on the inside. Make sure you have furniture such as dressers, bureaus, chests that are made of a hardwood that can shield your family from an attack. Also, keep your cell phone near your bed so you can grab it and have it readily available. The safe room in my home is the master bedroom itself. I have a dresser and a chest near the bed that will provide adequate support to any engagement in the home. Your safe room doesn\u2019t have to be like the movie Panic Room. You can have a designated room in the home that your family knows to go to."
