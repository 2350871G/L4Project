This area is generally the coldest, keeping these products freshest for the longest. This also helps juices from meat from contaminating the entire fridge in the event they drip. You should also wrap meat products carefully, especially raw meat, in plastic wrap to prevent contamination. Placed wrapped raw meat in a bowl, dish, tray, etc., to catch any leaking juices."

Even if your fridge does not have an adjustable humidity level for the crisper drawer, you should still store produce here. Items that thrive at lower humidity include many fruits, such as apples, avocados, peaches, plums, and pears. Vegetables, like green onions, broccoli, and cauliflower, do well at higher humidity levels."

Snack foods and spreads, like hummus, jam, and jelly, can be stored in the upper level of the fridge. While yogurt is a dairy product, it is fermented so it can safely be stored in the upper shelf.
