If you'd like to flavor the beans as they cook, add 2 to 3 cloves of peeled garlic and 1 bay leaf.

A natural pressure release will take about 20 to 30 minutes before you can open the pressure cooker. If you're doing a quick pressure release, keep your hands and face away from the steam as it escapes."
