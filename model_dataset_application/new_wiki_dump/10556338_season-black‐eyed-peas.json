Place the bacon into a large saucepan with a dash of oil and fry it on a medium heat. Use a spatula to move the bacon around to stop it from sticking to the pan. Rice bran oil or olive oil are good frying options for this recipe. Place the bacon into a small bowl once it is cooked. Any sized bacon pieces will work fine for this recipe. Try cutting the slices into thin strips or into 0.5 in (1.3 cm) squares. It will take about 5 minutes to fry the bacon."
