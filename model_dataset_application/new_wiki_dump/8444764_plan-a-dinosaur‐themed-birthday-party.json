You can try dinosaur-shaped cards, or cards that are embellished with drawings of dinosaurs. If you want to make the cards yourself, or if your child does, buy some blank cards. Handwrite information on the front like the date, time, and so on. You can cut out cardboard shapes of dinosaurs using stencils and paste them on the inside of the invitations.

However, you can also use plain green or gray tablecloths and decorate from there. For example, lay down a gray tablecloth and scatter fake leaves over it. You can make the leaves yourself using stencils and cardboard or purchase fake leaves. Then, you can place plastic dinosaur toys running down the center of the table. This creates a fun, prehistoric theme."

Serve drinks of this color, and call them things like \"Lava Juice\" and \"Swamp Punch.\" A fun thing to do with swamp drinks is to place gummy fish and worms in them. For example, use a green drink, like Mountain Dew, and have a few Swedish fish placed at the bottom of the cup. Go for fizzy red drinks, such as red sodas, to give them a lava-like appearance. You can also add a scoop of sherbet on top of the glass to create an extra fizzy appearance."
