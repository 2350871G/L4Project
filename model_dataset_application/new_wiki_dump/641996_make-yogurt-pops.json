          "description":"You can use any kind of yogurt you like to make yogurt pops, including Greek, plain, flavored, coconut, soy, whipped, or non-fat yogurt. You can even try making the pops with yogurt drinks like kefir and lassi. Transfer the yogurt to a medium mixing bowl. Greek yogurt is quite thick, so if you do use this to make your pops, you'll have to thin it out with the \u00bd cup (118 ml) of milk. Add the milk to the bowl with the yogurt and whisk to combine."

You can use any type of sweetener you like for this recipe, but liquid ones will incorporate better into the yogurt.

Transfer the berries to a blender or food processor and blend until the berries reduce to a syrup or paste. Pour the berry paste into the yogurt and stir to combine. Fruit you can add to your pops include:\nStrawberries\nRaspberries\nBlueberries\nBlackberries\nBanana\nPineapple\nKiwi\nPeaches"

          "description":"Jam is a great fruit alternative if you're making yogurt pops in winter when there are no berries in season. You can also substitute frozen berries for fresh ones if those are all that\u2019s available. Use the same quantity of frozen berries in place of fresh ones. Use 1 cup (325 g) of jam or preserves in place of fresh or frozen berries."

Add the granola to the bowl and fold it into the yogurt with the rubber spatula. You can use any type of granola you like in your pops, including cereal, trail mix, nut mix, granola clusters, or any other similar mix."

Fold the coconut in with the yogurt and pineapple until it\u2019s evenly distributed throughout the yogurt. If you use sweetened coconut to make these pops, add less sugar to avoid making them overly sweet."

Leave out the granola and the coconut shreds, and use unsweetened chocolate to avoid pops that are overly sugary. If you use plain or vanilla yogurt and want chocolate-colored pops, whisk 1 tablespoon (7 g) of cocoa powder into the yogurt before adding the banana and coconut."
