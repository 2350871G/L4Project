          "description":"Good steaks should be very pink in color and fresh-looking, with little to no odor about the meat. Any off-smell or gray color on the meat is a bad sign. Good steaks will be streaky with white fat. That's a good sign that means flavor. Very lean meat can also be cooked to taste delicious, but sometimes you'll need to add some fat to make up for the leanness. If you're grilling, strip steak or rib eye are great choices. If you're cooking in a pan, go for a sirloin, New York strip, or a porterhouse. Most steak cuts can be cooked in basically the same way. Don't be too intimidated by the different varieties. Experiment with different cuts and see what you like best."

          "headline":"Salt the steak about an hour before cooking.",
          "description":"Season both sides of a steak with coarse salt, black pepper, and other seasonings or spice rubs you like to use. Read the last section for some specific ideas about seasonings and marinades. There's some debate about when to season steak. Some people think that you shouldn't salt steak until it's about to go on the heat, because it draws out the water on the meat and makes it dry. Others think the earlier you salt the meat (up to 24 hours before cooking) the more flavor and juiciness in the meat. Both methods are common. Put salt on the steak ahead of time, but wait on pepper and other spices. These will burn and taste bitter if you put them into the high-heat skillet. Don't completely smother the steak in salt, as it can just make the steak super salty. A light coating on each side (enough for the steak juices to rinse off while cooking) is ideal. Avoid making it like a sugared donut."

        {
          "headline":"Bring the meat up to room temperature before cooking.",
          "description":"Take your steak out of the refrigerator at least an hour or two before you cook it, giving it time to gently come up to room temperature. If you throw a cold steak on the grill or stove, the inside will be very cold while the outside gets cooked. It's very difficult to cook a cold steak properly."

          "headline":"Cook steaks over high heat.",
          "description":"Good flavor comes from the golden-brown crust on the outside of steak. The only way to do this is to cook it over fairly high heat, then reduce the heat to finish the inside, or finish the steak in the oven, depending on how done you want it. Cooking steak at a lower temperature will take longer and make the stake quite a bit tougher. If you have a tough cut you want to tenderize, consider braising or otherwise tenderizing the meat before you cook it."

        {
          "headline":"Take the meat off the heat before it's done.",
          "description":"Meat will continue cooking while it rests, which means you should take it off direct heat when it's just under (within 15 degrees or so) of the doneness you're looking for. Use a meat thermometer, or the finger test. Beef steaks are done at the following temperatures:\nBlue-Rare or Very Rare: 110\u00b0 F (43.3\u00b0 C)\nRare: 120\u00b0 F (48.8\u00b0 C)\nMedium-rare: 130\u00b0 F (54.4\u00b0 C)\nMedium: 140\u00b0 F (60\u00b0 C)\nMedium-well: 150\u00b0 F (65.5\u00b0 C)\nWell Done: 160\u00b0 F (71.1\u00b0 C)"

          "headline":"Test for done-ness with your finger, if you don't have a thermometer.",
          "description":"Sometimes called the \"thumb method,\" you can test to see how done your steak is by pushing on the meat gently with your finger and seeing how much it gives. Then, touch your forefinger to the thumb of one hand, and press into the underside of your thumb, the fleshiest part, with your other hand. This is what a rare steak feels like. Continue with each of the fingers for progressive levels of doneness:\nRare: Forefinger\nMedium-Rare: Middle Finger\nMedium: Ring Finger\nWell Done: Little finger"

          "description":"Lots of people get worried that their meat is underdone or overdone. Some people love a rare steak, while others won't touch meat with any pink in the center. If you're cooking for a picky eater, or just want to make sure your steak is right, just cut into it and check. You're not cooking at a restaurant. It'll still taste great."

          "headline":"Always cover the meat and let it rest.",
          "description":"Remove the meat to a plate, cover with aluminum foil, and let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting into the meat. This allows the meat fibers, which contract during cooking, to relax and redistribute the juice throughout the meat. Steak will be juicier and tastier if you let it rest."

        {
          "headline":"Use a high-heat oil to coat the skillet.",
          "description":"Olive oil has a low smoke point, and will smoke very quickly and taste somewhat bitter. You want an oil that will get hotter without smoking too much. Grapeseed, gram, or canola are all ideal. Some people like to add a little butter to the skillet as well, for an added nutty flavor. You can add it at the beginning, or wait until you flip the steak."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cook one steak at a time.",
          "description":"Don't crowd the skillet with too many steaks, or the temperature will lower in the pan and the steaks will cook unevenly. Steaks don't take long to cook, so take your time and do them one at a time. When the skillet it hot, lay in the seasoned steak, dropping it into the skillet away from you to avoid splatter. If the skillet isn't hot and the meat doesn't sizzle, take the meat out and wait. Putting a piece of steak into a cold pan will make a tough steak."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cook 4-6 minutes on each side.",
          "description":"Put the meat in the skillet and leave it alone for about five minutes. Let it caramelize on that side. You don't need to prod at it, check on it, or do anything. Just let the meat cook. Don't push on the steak or press it into the skillet. There's no need to do this. Cook thinner steaks for no more than four minutes and thicker steaks for up to six, depending on how done you like your steak. Flip the steak to the other side when it's ready."

          "headline":"Flip the steak with tongs or a fork.",
          "description":"If you have them, tongs are great for cooking a steak, because you don't have to pierce the meat. Forks are also fine, though some people prefer not to pierce the meat before slicing it. It's not a huge deal, either way, and some people swear by either method."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Lower the heat and finish the steak, if necessary.",
          "description":"If you like a steak on the rare side, it should be done with a few minutes on each side, and 10-15 minutes of resting while covered. But if your steaks are very thick, or you like them a little more done, the best way to cook them is by finishing them in the oven. Spoon extra butter over the steak and plate in the center of the oven at 275 degrees F. Finish it for 5-10 minutes, until the temperature shows where you want it on the thermometer, or it feels the firmness you're looking for."

          "description":"Sometimes called \"lump charcoal,\" hardwood burns at high temperature for a short amount of time, making it ideal for cooking steaks. It's easy to light without lighter fluid, so just use a charcoal chimney and some newspaper to get it started. Arrange a sear-side and a warm side by putting the coals to one side of the grill. This means you can cook steaks to a variety of levels of done-ness if necessary, giving you more control. If you use a gas grill, turn the flame on medium-high. You'll probably end up having to cook the steaks a little longer on gas, but it'll still be great."

          "headline":"Brush oil and seasoning on both sides of the steaks.",
          "description":"Prepare the steaks as if you were cooking them in any other way, bringing them to room temperature and seasoning them a bit ahead of time. Instead of greasing the skillet or the grate, though, you'll brush some cooking oil onto the meat itself. Some people will skip this step, but it's a nice way to get a crust on your meat. Alternatively, some people like to put a dab of butter on the meat, after flipping it."

          "headline":"Let the grate heat up and put the steaks on.",
          "description":"Once the coals are ready, replace the grill grate and the lid of the grill, to give it enough time to come up to heat. The coals cook the grill, but the grate gives it it's tasty crust and grill-marks. When the grill gets hot and the coals are ready, put the steaks over the hot part of the grill, so they sizzle. Some people prefer cooking the steaks over the cold part of the grill first, then searing at the end. This works fine for cold steaks. If your steak is room temperature, like it should be, sear it first."

          "description":"Put the steak on the grill, put the lid on the grill and let the hardwood smoke flavor the meat and cook it. Wait for about 4-5 minutes until you do anything. Nothing bad is going to happen to the steak. Just keep an eye on the timer and let the grill cook the steak. Flip the steak to the other side and let it sear and cook for another five minutes. Depending on your cuts and the temperature of your steak, it should be done after about 10 minutes total. Lot of people like to be hands-on with a nice piece of steak. Some people swear by the \"don't touch it\" method, while others prefer flipping regularly to cook the steak evenly. The truth is that neither method is wrong and they're both great ways to cook steak done properly. Flip it early and often, if you want. You're not at a restaurant and you don't need to rush."

          "headline":"Move the steak to the cooler part of the grill.",
          "description":"After searing the steak, it should be just about done, if it's not done already. Use your thermometer or your finger to check for doneness and move the steak to a cooler part of the grill if you want to cook it longer. When the steak is done, remove from the heat, put it on a plate, and rest it covered for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving."

Mix the marinade up in a plastic Ziplock bag, add the steaks, and marinade overnight in the refrigerator. Don't forget to let the meat get back to room temperature before grilling.

Green herbs like rosemary, thyme, and oregano can be great on steak, while red pepper flakes, black pepper, coriander, and mustard seed can be surprising additions. Use flavors you like. For something surprising and unusual, try mixing up a tablespoon each of fresh-ground or crushed fennel seed, anise, cinnamon, peppercorn, and clove, along with salt to taste.
