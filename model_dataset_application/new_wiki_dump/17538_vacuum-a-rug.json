  "text":" Vacuuming a Woven Rug Find the pile direction of your rug. Woven rugs can either have heavy pile, thin pile, or no pile at all - it\u2019s just the density of the vertical fibers protruding from the rug.

If you are brushing against the pile, you will feel resistance. Always dust or brush woven rugs in the direction of the pile. Stroking against the pile can cause softer wools to break. Vacuum perpendicularly to the pile direction. If you vacuum with the pile direction, the fibers will cover and protect the dirt you are trying to remove. If you vacuum against the pile direction, this can provide unnecessary wear on the rug and can cause shedding and damage. Avoid vacuuming the fringe. While vacuuming along the edges, use a hand or foot to hold down the fringe. Vacuuming the fringe can cause damage to both the vacuum and the rug. Vacuums without beater bars are best for this task because the fringe cannot get tangled inside the vacuum. Vacuuming a Tufted Rug Check the underside for peeling. Tufted rugs are held together by a layer of latex glue that secures the tufts and prevents them from falling out. If your rug is particularly old, this layer of glue will show signs of cracking and crumbling, meaning that the tufts are no longer secure. If you notice patches on the underside of your rug that are missing glue, be extra careful when cleaning that portion of the rug.

Flat weave rugs have no pile and are made from durable materials.

Although excessive vacuuming can sometimes cause the rug to shed, the durable materials can endure quite a lot before this occurs. Be careful with the fringe.

For this reason, either temporarily turn off the beater bar when vacuuming the edges, or use a canister vacuum that relies only on suction. If you only have access to a beater bar vacuum, manually hold down the fringe as you vacuum past it. Vacuum both sides. Flat weave rugs are reversible and both sides are susceptible to becoming dirty. By vacuuming both sides you are removing grit that may wear your rug out early. Flip these rugs occasionally to distribute wear evenly to both sides. This will increase their lifespan and decrease shedding. Vacuuming a Shag Rug Flip the rug and vacuum the underside. By doing this first, you will be able to dislodge dirt and dust that is clinging deep within the rug. This should be done using a vacuum with a beater bar. Stand on top of the rug and use your feet to prevent the edges from flipping up as you vacuum along them. Alternatively, you and a friend can flip the shag rug upside down and shake it vigorously to shake off dirt and dust. Shag rugs are abnormally heavy, however, so this will be difficult for you to do alone. Vacuum the floor underneath the rug. Roll the shag rug up and set it aside for a moment. There should be dirt and dust on the floor that you dislodged earlier. Vacuum these up then place your rug back where it was, this time face up. Vacuum the topside with light suction. Unlike the underside, vacuums with beater bars are not recommended for use on the topside, as the long fibers will wrap around them and cause damage to the vacuum. Using a vacuum with high suction can also cause damage by pulling the tufts out of the carpet. Instead, use a smaller vacuum with low suction or use the crevice tool to gently clean the topside.",
