          "description":"Start by drawing out the shape of your plot and any features that are already present, such as trees, a pool, or a gazebo. Then, sketch out where you plan to add furniture or structures. Next, draw a pathway that is wide enough for you to pass through the garden that allows you to access each feature. Measure each feature of the garden so that your sketch will roughly be to scale. This will ensure that everything will fit once you start implementing your garden plans. If necessary, rearrange or eliminate features to ensure that everything will fit. The width of your pathway will vary, but they're commonly 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.22 m) wide. Although you don\u2019t need to draw the plants you want to add, you can if you\u2019d like. It's a good idea to group plants that have similar light, soil, and water requirements, so you may want to plan their location. Additionally, you could plan out where you want to place plants that require extra space, such as a palm tree."

          "description":"It\u2019s best to install the biggest features of your garden first. This way, you can add your furniture, plants, and accents around the larger pieces. It will be easier to choose the plants you want to include after you can see the bare bones of your garden in place. For example, you might want to install a tiki bar, gazebo, or covered area. Installing the larger structures last could damage parts of your garden."

          "description":"This could include patio sets, benches, chairs, or similar furniture. What you include will depend on the space you have available. If you\u2019re buying furniture, choose items that have an exotic or tropical feel. For example, you could include a bamboo lounge chair. You might also include a meditation bench that will stand in front of a reflecting pool. If you choose a patio set, look for a bamboo base or a fabric that features large, tropical flowers."

          "headline":"Set up a water feature that gives a tropical vibe.",
          "description":"Since exotic gardens often have a tropical feel, a water feature helps evoke the look you want. Great options for an exotic garden include a bird bath, a waterfall, a swimming pool, a reflecting pool, or a koi pond. Choose the option(s) that work for your space. If you can, include more than one. Consider the size of your space, as well as your budget. There are options for everyone! For example, a small garden may fit just a birdbath or a small reflecting pool. Alternatively, you could include a small tabletop waterfall on your porch, which is very budget friendly! A larger space might include a pool with a waterfall."

You can mark off these areas any way you\u2019d like, as you just need a visual reminder of where the bed will be. This will allow you to install your walkways. If you want the outline to be permanent, you might place lava stones. If you just need a temporary barrier, you could stick popsicle sticks into the ground."

To play up the tropical look, choose natural stones or rocks. Stones with irregular edges look more exotic than stones that are perfectly square. However, you should also choose what looks good to you."

Not only will the luscious leaves bring a tropical look, their rustle will add to the tropical feel. In colder areas, you might choose potted palms that can be moved inside during the winter. Your area is considered to be \"colder\" if it has a hardiness zone lower than 9. You can find your hardiness zone here: http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/. Larger palms, such as palm trees, grow best in warm, moist regions."

It thrives best in areas that have a mild winter, but it can be grown as an accent in most areas. You can use bamboo to line the borders of your garden by planting several stalks in a row. Alternatively, you could accent areas of your garden with a few stalks of bamboo. If winters in your area are very cold, your bamboo may die. Hardy bamboo can survive temperatures as low as 10 to 20 \u00b0F (\u221212 to \u22127 \u00b0C), and tropical bamboo can survive temperatures as low as 30 to 40 \u00b0F (\u22121 to 4 \u00b0C). You can replant a new crop after the weather warms up again."

You can choose to focus on 1 or 2 colors to fit your style, or you can incorporate many colors. When choosing your plants, remember to check the soil, light, and climate needs for them. The best tropical flowers to look for include:\nFrangipani\nHibiscus\nGinger\nCanna lilies\nVireya rhododendron\nFijian fire plant\nImpatiens\nBegonias\nLobelias\nEucomis\nOrchids"

You can also find large tropical plants that have irregularly shaped leaves or patterned leaves, which add visual interest to your garden. When selecting your plants, consider the climate, soil and light requirements to make sure they'll thrive. Some great options include:\nGiant elephant\u2019s ears\nElephant\u2019s ears\nPrayer plant (also called maranta)\nZebra plant\nAbyssinian banana\nCrotons\nAgave"

Make sure that you choose plants that grow well in your climate. You should also check their light and soil requirements. Vining plants like bougainvillea or passion flower can adorn your walls, fence, or wooden structure. Orchids make a great hanging accent. Lobelias and impatiens are also beautiful options."

You may want to place big plants next to smaller plants, or you could add pops of color to areas that have a lot of green. For example, you could place colorful canna lilies among a series of big, leafy palms. You could also pair a lush palm shrub with a few stalks of bamboo and bright hibiscus."

Plant ground cover in the foreground of your garden. For example, place palm trees, palm shrubs, and bamboo along the boundaries of your garden. Incorporate medium-sized plants like elephant\u2019s ears, zebra plants, canna lilies, and hibiscus in the mid-ground of your garden.

Colored containers add more pops of color to your garden, especially in areas where you\u2019ve planted a lot of greenery. For example, you could mix square and round pots, as well as large, medium, and small pots. Great color options include bright colors like orange, red, yellow, pink, purple, or blue.

Additionally, you may consider installing a mesh screen in pools or ponds, which will protect children if they do fall in. If you have small children, make sure that your water features are secure at all times. It's a good idea to use a pool cover if you have a pool and to install a mesh screen over a pond.
