Add \u00be cup (95 g) of the flour. Stir the mixture into a paste. Place it on top of the refrigerator for 30 minutes. You want to put the yeast somewhere warm to rise, which is why the top of the refrigerator is a good choice. Reserve the remaining quantities of these ingredients for later."

Use the paddle attachment and mix the ingredients on low speed for 30 seconds to create a smooth dough. Turn off the mixer. If you don\u2019t have a stand mixer, combine all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to mix the batter."

It\u2019s important to turn the mixer off between additions because you don\u2019t want to overmix the batter.

After 30 minutes, remove the plastic wrap. Press gently on the dough to push out air and gasses. Recover the bowl and transfer the dough to the refrigerator for at least one hour. You can leave the dough to chill for up to 12 hours before making the donuts."

Use a 3-inch (7.6-cm) diameter cookie or donut cutter to punch out as many donuts as possible. When you\u2019ve punched out all the donuts you can, collect the dough scraps. Roll them into a ball, and roll the dough out again into a circle with the same thickness as the original. Punch out as many donuts as you can. With any leftover dough, roll the dough into half-inch (1.3-cm) balls to make donut holes."

Transfer the donuts to the baking sheet, leaving an inch (2.5 cm) of space between each donut. Lay a sheet of plastic loosely over the donuts and transfer them to a warm place to rise for an hour. A good warm place to proof the donuts is an oven that\u2019s turned off but with the light on."

Heat the oil over medium heat until it reaches 360 F (182 C). Transfer as many donuts to the oil as you can fit into the fryer or pan. Fry the donuts for one to two minutes. Flip the donuts and cook for another one to two minutes. The donuts are ready when they're golden brown on both sides. You may need to work in batches to fry all the donuts and the donut holes."

Let the donuts cool for at least 20 minutes before glazing, adding your favorite toppings, or eating plain. To add an extra bit of sweetness to the donuts without glazing them, dust them with confectioner\u2019s sugar after about 30 minutes."
