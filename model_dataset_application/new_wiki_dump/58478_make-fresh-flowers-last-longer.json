Wait for 1 day. Repeat; add another tablet. Leave the flowers be after this. The aspirin will help the flowers to stay fresh for around five to nine days without putting in new aspirin pieces. Using Homemade Plant Food Make homemade plant food. Flowers need food, water, and a clean environment. As such, their water should have a little food, like sugar, and some bleach to slow fungi and bacteria growth. Here's a basic home recipe:\nMix together 1 quart water + 2 tablespoons lemon juice + 1 tablespoon sugar + 1/2 teaspoon bleach. Pour into the vase. Trim the flower stems. This is to open the stems up to the water. Cut off the dried bottoms at an angle, the angle allowing them to take up as much water as possible. Trim the ends, which tend to get gummy and closed, every three or four days to keep them fresh longer. Remove leaves.
