          "description":"Villagers (or Settlers, depending on which version of AoE you are playing) are required to gather Wood for constructing houses, and they are also the units that do the actual construction of buildings. To create, or train, villagers, select the Town Center by left-clicking it. A panel will be displayed in the bottom-left or right corner of the screen containing buttons for all the functions that the Town Center can perform. The first button on the panel is always the \u201cCreate Villager\u201d button, and will usually have a picture of a worker on it. Click this button as many times as the number of villagers you want to create. Villagers cost resources to create, the amount and type of which depends on the version of AoE you are playing. For instance, in AoE 3, a villager usually costs 100 Food to create. If your colony is already at its population limit, you cannot create additional villagers. In this case, use the villagers you already have by taking them off other tasks. If you don\u2019t have any villagers at all, you can lower your population by sending your military to war so that some of them get killed off."
