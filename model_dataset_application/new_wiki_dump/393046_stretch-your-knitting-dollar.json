This cost-saving measure is best used for practice projects. Slippers are an exception where acrylic yarn can work well. The acrylic keeps them warm, and they are expected to scuff anyway."

However, keep in mind that if you're going to change the weight of yarn, you may need considerably more to make the project the right size and buying more yarn may eliminate any savings from buying a thinner yarn. If you're going to make this sort of change, buy the yarn based on yardage rather than how many grams you're getting in a skein."
