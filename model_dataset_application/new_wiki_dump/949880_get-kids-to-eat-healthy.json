          "description":"Find ways to break down nutritional concepts so that kids can see why healthy food is so important. You'll be surprised at how quickly kids pick up on certain concepts, especially if you can relate it to their interests:\n\nProteins found in chicken, fish, and beans make up your muscles and organs, and are essential for growing strong. Carbohydrates found in whole-grain bread, pasta, and rice provide you with the energy needed to move and be active, and whole grains have much more energy than white bread and processed (factory-made) sugars. Fruits and Vegetables contain vitamins and minerals that help your eyes, ears, and brain work to the best of their ability, and keep you from getting sick."

          "description":"Depending on their age, different children will need different amounts of food. The following rough guidelines are for young children age 9-13, provided by the Mayo Clinic. Girls are on the lower end while boys are generally on the higher end of the estimates:\n\nCalories: 1,400 - 2,600\n\nProtein: 4-6 ounces\n\nFruits: 1.5 - 2 cups\n\nVegetables: 1.5 - 3.5 cups\n\nGrains: 5-9 ounces\n\nDairy: 2.5 - 3 cups\nThese are estimates meant to help you gauge relative amounts of food. While you don't have to measure out each ounce, you do want roughly 50% more grain than protein, for example."

          "description":"A good, healthy meal for your child doesn't need to be complicated. Instead, you should aim for balance in a meal -- two or three simple dishes are perfect for a good dinner, for example. A balanced meal needs to include:\nA whole-grain carbohydrate, such as bread, pasta, or rice. A protein source like beans, chicken, or fish. A fruit or vegetable."

          "description":"Start the day off well with a good breakfast, and give your child healthy snacks every 1-2 hours. Hungry kids are cranky kids, and a cranky kid is more likely to put up a stink when faced with a new or \"gross\" food. Keep them well fed throughout the day and they will be more likely to try something new when it is put in front of them. Make sure a child always eats breakfast to start their metabolism and get the necessary fuel to do well in school."

For example, you might notice that you child loves tomatoes. To convince them to eat healthier, you might start with tomato salads, introducing a few cucumbers or carrots as well to get them slowly eating better food. Note foods you child can't stand as well and keep them off the table to start -- seeing one food they detest may make a kid turn their nose up at the rest of the meal too."

Substitute healthier snacks for treats and candy, like fruits, pretzels, and hummus. While you don't have to completely cut out junk food, removing the temptation will make kids less likely to clamor for junk. Make desserts together at home, like a simple cake or chocolate cookies, to get kids more interested in their food and turn junk food into an activity, not an everyday occurrence. Studies show that making some foods \"off-limits\" makes them more desirable to kids. Don't eliminate junk food, just make it a \"sometimes food.\""

The more often you give a child choices the more excited they will be to eat something you put in front of them."

Have them choose one part of the meal each night, make your grocery list with you, or prepare simple parts of the meal, like mixing or stirring things. See what foods your child gravitates towards in the store and reward them for their help. If they seem interested, challenge the kid to balance the meal themselves. Make a chart for each day of the week with space for a protein, carb, and fruit/vegetable and let them choose something for each category. Offer to let teens and older children take charge of one meal a night. Let them know that you'll eat whatever they make, as long as they do too."

Kids will feel more comfortable trying new things if their friends are doing it, and they can feel proud bringing recipes or nutrition facts back home to you.

While you don't need to go overboard, healthy food is a lot easier to get on the table if it is hidden behind something fun. Let them know fun or exotic names of things, like Papaya, Mango, Zucchini, or Bok Choi. Cut up vegetables into fun shapes.

Kids love to feel like they are in charge of their own decisions, and will likely model their behavior after you. It also lets them put as much of a new food on their plate as they want to sample before coming back for seconds.

Put the food in front of them and ask them to give it a try, but don't get upset if they won't finish it. Thank them for trying and move on to another food.

Roast your vegetables for a french-fry like texture. Roast veggies are often the easiest for kids to stomach. Try roasting parsnips, sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, squash, and brussel sprouts in a high-heat oven with a little olive oil and salt for a crispy, crunchy side dish. Bake chicken tenders instead of frying them. This actually applies to a wide variety of food. Frying requires a lot of oil, which adds fat and cholesterol to the meal. If you bake the meal, however, you can still provide some of your child's favorite foods with a healthier twist. If you can bake a food instead of frying it, it will almost always be healthier. Bring your child in on the spicing. Spicing is a great way to get kids involved with making dinner their own. Right before adding spices, call your child over and ask them to smell different scents. Which ones do they like? Which ones do you normally mix together? The child can then feel free to make their own \"special blend,\" customizing the flavor of chicken or fish to their liking. Remind them, however, that you only need a small pinch of spices to get a lot of flavor. Try making trail mix. Trail mix, customizable and naturally sweet, is a great on-the-go snack for picky children. It is usually a mixture of:\nCereal\nGranola\nDried Fruit\nNuts\nA touch of chocolate. Make your own hummus. This is a great source of protein, and you can often puree vegetables in as well. All you need are chickpeas, oil, and a food processor. Add salt, pepper, and herbs & spices to make the dip your own. Make a bean dip instead of cheesy or salty salsa. Beans have protein in them that will make the snack more filling and less salty, and kids will love having baked tortilla chips, which feel like junk food. Get individual yogurt cups just for them. Let them pick their favorite flavors and assure them that those are their personal yogurt cups. They'll be excited to have their own food and more likely to reach for it in the fridge. Whenever you can get \"individual\" healthy options, it lets them feel in control and happier to eat healthily. Match up fruits and vegetables with healthy dips. Apples and celery go fantastic with peanut butter, for example. Raw Carrots, peppers, and cucumbers match well with hummus. Kids will be more likely to eat healthy food if they can dip them in something delicious at the same time.",
