          "description":"Pick a mirror that\u2019s big enough to fit as much of you in the shot as you want. For instance, a small wall mirror works if you just want a selfie of your face, whereas you need a taller mirror if you want a picture of your whole body. Keep in mind that you can crop your selfies, too. If you just want your face in the picture, but you only have a giant wall mirror, crop the rest of your body out of the photo after you take it."

For example, put away any dirty clothes on the floor, make your bed, and check that anything potentially embarrassing, like your life-sized celebrity crush poster, is hidden.Tip: Don\u2019t forget to clean your mirror, too! Wipe it down with a cloth and glass cleaner to get rid of any smudges or spots."

To take advantage of this, open the blinds or curtains on windows to allow more light in and try to take your picture during the day when it\u2019s sunny outside. If it\u2019s nighttime, recreate natural lighting by turning on soft, warm lamps instead of bright overhead lights. Avoid fluorescent or harsh white lights which dull your skin. Make sure that the light isn\u2019t directly at your back. Otherwise, you\u2019ll just be a silhouette. Adjust the light if possible so that it hits you in the front."

This will ensure you have at least one that you like and gives you plenty of options to choose from. To automatically take more than one picture at a time, use the burst mode by holding down the shutter button or the volume button when you're ready for your selfie. If you have one pose that you like, take multiple pictures in it, making slight tweaks each time. For instance, if you like your legs crossed, take one shot with your hand on your hip and another with your hand in your pocket."
