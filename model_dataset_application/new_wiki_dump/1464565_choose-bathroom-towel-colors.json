          "headline":"Choose colored towels for a bold style.",
          "description":"If your bathroom is currently neutral, colored towels are the easiest way to add visual interest. And because there are so many shades available, you don't have to tie yourself down to just one color. You can match your towels to your shower curtain for a cohesive look, or pick towels in a contrasting color. Create an ombre effect with your bathroom towels by buying different sized towels in various shades of the same color. Buy your largest towels in the darkest shade and lighten the shade as the size of your towels decrease. If your bathroom is already brightly colored, gravitate towards more neutral towel colors."

          "headline":"Look for patterns to add fun and whimsy.",
          "description":"Patterned towels show a great deal of color interest and are a great way to tie the different shades of your bathroom together. Look for tones that already exist in your bathroom and try to find a towel that infuses those color tones into the towel\u2019s pattern. Patterned towels work especially well in kids\u2019 bathrooms and small powder rooms. If you have a tile floor, look to mirror the tile\u2019s color in your patterned towels. If you already have a heavily patterned shower curtain, steer away from using additional patterns in your towels."

          "headline":"Mix patterns within your towels to add texture.",
          "description":"Layering patterns within your towels is a cool and easy way to make your towel display look more textured. Start off with a basic white bath towel with a colored accent, like stripes. Add an accent hand towel and top the whole thing off with a monogrammed washcloth. Or, mix solid towels with ones that have a complementary pattern so the colors don\u2019t clash. Monograms are an easy and classy way to lend some sophistication to a bathroom. The more high quality your towels are, the more impressive your pattern mixing will look. Mix polka dots with stripes for a preppy vibe. Alternate chevron with stripes for a more modern look."

Set floral towels against solid towels to give your bathroom a vintage throwback feel. Do not mix floral patterns, as this will prove visually overwhelming. Buy floral hand towels and set them against larger bathroom linens in a pale pink or ivory tone."

If your bathroom is painted gray, try adding canary yellow bath towels. If your bathroom is black and white, add pink towels for a feminine flair.

If you have a small bathroom, stick with neutral shades for your towels; they\u2019ll make your bathroom appear bigger and more open. If you have a smaller bathroom, you may need smaller towels. Bath sheets (oversized bath towels) typically won\u2019t fit on the hooks in small bathrooms, so buy bath towels instead."

If you\u2019re unsure whether a pattern will go with your already existing d\u00e9cor, it\u2019s better to be too subtle than too bold.
