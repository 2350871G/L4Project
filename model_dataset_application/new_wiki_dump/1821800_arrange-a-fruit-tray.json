  "text":" Slice the Melon Cut the melon in half and scoop out the seeds with a spoon.  Place the melon halves on a cutting board and cut each into 6 lengthwise slices.  Cut the lengthwise slices into 4 equal parts to create bite-sized pieces.  Slice the Pineapple Place the pineapple on your cutting board and slice off the top and bottom of the pineapple.  Stand the pineapple on its bottom and use a very sharp knife to peel it. Slice straight down, making sure to remove the \u201ceyes\u201d. Slice the pineapple in half lengthwise and remove the core by cutting a \u201cV\u201d shape down the center of each half.  Place both cored halves, cut side down, on a cutting board and slice each half into 8 lengthwise pieces.  Cut the lengthwise pieces into quarters to create bite-sized chunks.  Prepare the Strawberries Remove the stems from strawberries by inserting the tip of a paring knife at the edge of the stem and cut around it until you get back to the beginning and then lift the stem out.  Large strawberries may be sliced in half for easier eating; otherwise, leave the strawberries whole.  Slice the Apple and Pear Cut both the apple and pear lengthwise into quarters and remove their stems. If you\u2019re not using an apple corer to remove the seeds, remove the wedges that contain seeds after you quarter the fruit. Rub the cut surfaces of the apple and pear segments with lemon juice, or add lemon juice to a bowl of cold water and immerse the slices.  Arrange the Fruits on Your Tray Place your melon around the perimeter of your platter.  Arrange the pineapple next, with the pineapple just slightly overlapping the melon, making sure that there is no space between the two fruit sections.  Align the strawberries along the inner rim of the pineapple.  Add the apple slices, making sure they slightly overlap the strawberries.  Place a bunch of grapes in the center of the platter.  Garish the outer rim of the platter with flat leaves, such as grape or lemon leaves, or consider adding mint leaves as a finishing touch and place small containers of toothpicks near the platter. ",
