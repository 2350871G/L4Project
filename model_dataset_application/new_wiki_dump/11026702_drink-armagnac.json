Armagnac is exclusively distilled in the Gascony area of southwest France, and you will want to make sure that any bottle you choose has this on the label. Some other names to look for are Bas-Armagnac, Armagnac-T\u00e9nar\u00e8ze, and Haut-Armagnac. Haut-Armagnac and Armagnac-T\u00e9nar\u00e8ze produce well admired, high quality brandies, but Bas-Armagnac is known for producing the highest quality Armagnacs."

These bottles will be priced at hundreds or even thousands of dollars but would definitely be special to experience. Keep in mind that non-vintage-dated Armagnac can be just as good and you in no way have to buy the most expensive kind!"

It will have a fruity flavor, and you might taste notes of prune, apricot, or quince. Choose a darker Armagnac for richer flavors. Older Armagnac is darker in color and will taste more of toffee, chocolate, or caramel. The oldest Armagnacs will have notes of spices like cinnamon and pepper."
