One way to get a jump-start on this information is by browsing the game's community forums or by observing other players' gameplay.

If you're not prepared to \"play the objective\", consider playing a game type that doesn't emphasize teamwork. An example of this concept might be leaving powerful equipment, weapons, or vehicles for another team mate if you know you aren't well-equipped to handle them. If you're playing a game without a team dynamic, ignore this step."
