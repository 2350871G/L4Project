Then add the vanilla and the milk to the butter, while you continue to mix. Gradually add the powdered sugar, while continuing to use the mixer. Add it bit by bit, over the course of about 15-20 seconds. That way it doesn\u2019t clump as you try to stir it."

          "description":"If you want to use several different colors with your decorations, spread your icing out in several different bowls. You can keep one batch plain white, and add colors to the other batches. To make sure you get the color you want, add the food coloring gradually. Remember that the icing will often dry darker than it looks when it is wet. Start with a few drops of color then stir to see the new color of the icing. Continue to add the food coloring, a few drops at a time, until the shade is what you want. Darker, bolder colors will require more food coloring. In some cases, you may need as much as half a bottle of food coloring."

You can purchase bags and metal piping tips, or you can just make your own using a plastic sandwich bag. Spoon the icing into the sandwich bag, and cut a small hole in the corner of the sandwich bag. Cut a very small piece of the corner to start, because you can always expand it if you need to. If you cut too much, the icing will pour out too quickly. Use one bag for each color, including the plain white icing."

One is a bit thicker, while the other is a bit runnier, almost like the consistency of syrup. The thicker icing is the one you already created. It can be used for detailing, or drawing lines with frosting on your cookies. You can make the thinner icing by adding water to your icing, a little bit at a time. This runnier version can be used in a \"flooding\" technique, where you cover the entire surface of your cookie with a smooth, flat icing."

This can add a little pop of chocolate flavor to your cookies as well as a contrasting color. To do this, you'll have to:\nGet a bowl of melted chocolate. Holding the edge of the cookie, turn it upside down so just the top dips into the melted chocolate. Twist the cookie a bit, left to right, to make sure that the entire top is covered in a thin layer of chocolate. Let the chocolate dry completely, it will take about an hour."

One easy design is to paint polka dots. You just squeeze small drops of icing out of your piping bags and drop them across the top of your cookie. The polka dots could easily be turned into hearts. With a toothpick, just shape the polka dots into the shape of hearts while they\u2019re still wet. You can make stripes on the cookies that could easily be converted to zig zags.
