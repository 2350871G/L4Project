  "text":" Preparing to Install Make sure that you have the correct equipment. You'll need the following items for this task:\n\nSDHC card - A large SD card of up to 8 gigabytes is needed to install Homebrew and perform other file-based tasks. USB flash drive - This is the drive on which you'll install the games. Wii remote - If you have a newer (black) model of Wii, you'll need a generic Wii remote to help with the installation. Format your flash drive for FAT32. To do so, select FAT32 (or MS-DOS (FAT) on a Mac) in the \"File System\" section of the format menu. Keep in mind that formatting a flash drive will erase its contents, so back up the contents to your computer or another flash drive if necessary. Empty the Wii's disc drive. If there is currently a disc in the Wii, remove it before proceeding. Connect your Wii to the Internet. Your Wii will need a network connection in order to install the bulk of the USB tool's files. Install Homebrew on your Wii. If you haven't yet installed the Homebrew channel for your Wii, you'll need to do so before proceeding. The Homebrew channel allows you to install custom modifications, one of which will let you play games off of a USB drive. Format your SD card. Once you've installed Homebrew with the SD card, you'll need to wipe it clean so that you can use it for the USB installation files. The easiest way to do this is by formatting the SD card. As with the flash drive, choose FAT32 (or MS-DOS (FAT) on a Mac) as the file system. Creating a Wii Flash Drive Use a Windows computer for this part. Unfortunately, you cannot format correctly your flash drive for Wii use on a Mac. If you don't have access to a Windows computer, try using a library PC or borrowing a friend's. Determine your Windows bit version. You'll need to know whether your version of Windows is a 64-bit system or a 32-bit system in order to know which file to download in a minute. Open the WBFS Manager website. Go to https://wbfsmanager.codeplex.com/ in your preferred browser. Click the DOWNLOADS tab. It's near the top of the page. Click a download link. Depending on your computer's bit number, this step will vary:\n\n64-bit - Click WBFSManager 3.0 RTW x64 under the \"OTHER AVAILABLE DOWNLOADS\" heading. 32-bit - Click WBFSManager 3.0.1 RTW x86 under the \"RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD\" heading. Open the ZIP folder. Double-click the downloaded ZIP folder to open it. Double-click setup. It's in the ZIP folder. Doing so will open the setup window. Install the program. To do so:\nCheck the \"I agree\" box and click Next\n\nClick Next twice more. Click Install\n\nUncheck the \"Show Readme\" box. Click Finish Plug your flash drive into your computer. The flash drive should fit into one of the rectangular USB ports on your computer. Open WBFS Manager. Double-click the WBFS Manager app icon, which resembles a Wii on a blue background, to do so. This should be on your computer's desktop. Click OK when prompted. This will bring you to the WBFS Manager main window. Select your flash drive. Click the \"Drive\" drop-down box in the upper-left corner of the window, then click your drive's letter (usually F:). If you don't know the flash drive's letter, look for it in the \"Devices and drives\" section of the This PC app. Format the flash drive. Click Format at the top of the window, click Yes when prompted, and then click OK when prompted. Eject the flash drive. Click on the flash drive's icon in the lower-right side of the screen, then click Eject in the pop-up menu and remove the drive from your computer. You may have to click ^ here to see the flash drive's icon. Downloading the Installation Files Plug your SD card into your computer. The SD card should fit into your computer's SD card slot angled-side-in, logo-side-up. If your computer doesn't have an SD card slot, you'll need to use a USB adapter for your SD card as well. Open the file download site. Go to https://app.box.com/s/ztl5x4vlw56thgk1n4wlx147v8rsz6vt in your browser. Click Download. It's a blue button in the middle of the page. The files' ZIP folder will download onto your computer. Extract the files.
