The best way to cook goat meat is to cook it slowly, preferably in a slow cooker, at a low temperature, and with plenty of moisture. Moreover, goat meat should never be served rare; it must be thoroughly and well cooked in order for it to be appealing. Flavorful additions tend to make goat meat delicious. Goat meat is ideal for eating with Middle Eastern, Mexican and Indian dishes that use a slow cooking method. The meat gets infused with spices as it becomes tender."
