          "description":"After about 1-2 years of growth, your walnut tree should have its basic form. It should have several moderately thick branches and be roughly 4\u20136 ft (1.2\u20131.8 m) tall. At this point, you can begin shaping the tree into the central leader position. The central leader position typically has 1 main trunk with about 5 branches on the side. The central leader position is based off the natural growth of the tree, focusing on a main leader branch that keeps the canopy of the tree open to light and air circulation. The central leader helps supply nutrients to the large, fruit bearing branches so the tree grows as many walnuts as possible."

          "description":"The branch at the very top is your \u201ccentral leader,\u201d which keeps the top of your tree open and airy. If you see additional branches growing towards the top, snip them off with garden shears or saw them away using a hand saw. This way, your tree can direct all its nutrients to this topmost branch."

          "description":"When pruning walnut trees, observe the \"3-to-1 rule.\" Examine the thickness of your trunk, and use this as a guide when deciding which branches to keep and which to remove. If you find a branch larger than \u2153 of the trunk's diameter, cut it off at a 45-degree angle. This way, your branches will all receive a balanced amount of nutrients and grow healthy and strong. If your tree has more than 1 thick branch, then it will be harder for the other branches to grow and develop walnuts. If you keep branches that are on the thicker side, they can unevenly drain the nutrients from the tree and grow too thick."

          "description":"A forked branch is a shoot with a split in the branch, causing 2 branches to grow from the main branch. These branches require more nutrients from the tree, and they often act as leeches from the other branches receiving vital nutrients. To prevent this, you can either cut off 1 side of the branch to make a single shoot, or you can cut off the branch entirely. Both options will help your tree better conserve nutrients. If you already have many adequate branches, you may want to simply remove the branch completely. If you have a few sparse branches, trim off the smaller of the forked sides."

These branches are cosmetically unattractive, and they often make the inner skeleton of your tree bulky and hard to access. As a result, your tree may not grow as many walnuts. To prevent this, cut off these branches where they meet the trunk of the tree. This way, your tree only grows outward-facing, healthy branches. This keeps the tree invigorated, so it can put more energy into fewer branches."

In addition, get rid of any discolored or thin branches. Small and damaged branches drain nutrients from your tree. Cut your branches at a 45-degree angle so you minimally damage the tree. These branches take away from the overall look and shape of the tree, and since they are not very strong, they likely will not grow walnuts."
