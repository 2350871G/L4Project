Take a screwdriver and turn the screw counterclockwise to loosen it. Then do the same thing on the other side of the door. Repeat this on both doors to loosen them.

Then lift up so the door comes off its track. Pull outward from the bottom to remove it from the frame. Use the same procedure to remove the other door. Glass doors can weight over 50 pounds (23 kg) each, so lift with your legs and keep the stress off your back. If you have trouble lifting the doors, have a partner help. Put the doors away in a safe place so you won\u2019t trip on them while you work."

Store it away in a safe place so you won\u2019t trip on any pieces. If you want to keep and reinstall the molding, then remove it gently.

French doors can come in a variety of sizes. Measure the height and width of your existing door frame. Then, look for a door set that matches that size. Leave \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) to \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) between the frame and the doors so there\u2019s room for them to fit. You can fill that space with caulk later on.

Then measure that length on the provided sill pan and make a line. Use a saw to cut along that line. Double check that your cut was correct before placing the pan down. Apply 3 rows of adhesive caulk along the floor of the door frame. This adhesive holds the sill pan in place without the need for screws. Squeeze 3 rows out from one end of the frame to the other. Some kits also instruct you to place the adhesive around the perimeter of the door instead of in 3 rows. Follow whichever directions you\u2019re given. Check that the caulk you use is labeled \"adhesive,\" or it won't bond well. Press the sill pan onto the caulk. Take the pan sill and place it on the adhesive. Press it down hard and work out any air bubbles or uneven spots. Use a roller or similar round object to roll across the pan and flatten it out further. Don't delay in pressing the pan down as soon as you squeeze out the adhesive. It may start drying quickly. Installing the French Door Frame Apply adhesive caulk along the perimeter of the sill pan. Use the same caulk that you used to glue down the sill pan. Squeeze more out around the perimeter of the sill. Seat the door frame into the sill pan. Tilt the door frame into the opening starting from the bottom. Press the bottom into the caulk on the sill and then straighten the frame out so it\u2019s fully in the opening. Hold it in place for a minute to let the adhesive bond to it. This will be difficult if you\u2019re alone. Have a partner help you carry and place the door.
