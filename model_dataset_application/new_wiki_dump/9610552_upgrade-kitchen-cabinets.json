          "description":"To create a more open, spacious feel, look for paints in paler shades. Avoid glossy paints, as these will show any painting imperfections more visibly. Acrylic, or water-based, paints typically create fewer fumes and are easier to clean up than oil-based paints. Make your upper cabinets a lighter color and the bottom cabinets darker to make your space look more trendy. Make sure the 2 colors are complementary to one another."

          "description":"To make painting easier, remove your cabinet doors and lay them on a flat surface, like a worktable or sawhorses. You can remove the doors by using a drill or screwdriver to take out the screws that hold the hinges in place. Make sure the area underneath them is protected with paper or cloth. Label your cabinet doors so you know where they go when you put them back. Remove the hinges before you paint your cabinets if you plan on upgrading them as well. If you are painting the shelves or exterior of the cabinet as well as the doors, you may want to cover your countertops with paper to protect them from paint drips."

          "headline":"Sand the cabinets by hand with 100-grit sandpaper.",
          "description":"Roughing up the surface of the cabinets will give the new paint something to hold onto. Sand the doors and any other surfaces you plan to paint by hand, and clear away the dust with a vacuum. It\u2019s a good idea to wear a dust mask or respirator while you work, to prevent sawdust from entering your lungs. If your cabinets are already painted and they\u2019re in good condition, you don\u2019t need to sand them."

        {
          "headline":"Apply 1-2 coats of paint.",
          "description":"Once the primer has dried completely, use a mini-roller or paintbrush to cover the surface with paint. Work slowly, go with the grain of the wood, and avoid piling paint at corners and edges. When painting the doors, let one side dry completely before flipping them and painting the opposite side. It can be helpful to have a smaller paintbrush on hand to even out piled-up paint or to reach small corners. Use a 2-in-1 paint and primer if you don\u2019t want to wait for primer to dry. Use a satin or semi-gloss paint for your cabinets so they\u2019re easier to clean once they dry."

This works best for cabinets that have some wood between the top of the doors and the ceiling. It\u2019s better to install crown molding when you\u2019re repainting your cabinets to ensure that the colors match. It\u2019s important to measure the angles of your cabinets accurately, so that you can cut the molding to fit correctly.

Look for new knobs or handles in your local hardware store and use them to replace your old ones. Buy a set or mix and match. Your old knobs or handles should be easy to remove with a screwdriver or drill. The screws should be visible on either the face or the inside of the cabinet door. If your knobs are in good condition, you can remove and spray paint them to update how they look."

It can also hide any nicks, dings or stains that have accumulated over the years. Use spray adhesive to stick the wallpaper on, and coat the whole door with a thin layer of decoupage after it dries. While you can use any kind of paper, wallpaper is ideal because it tends to be thicker and more moisture-resistant than regular paper, and can usually be cleaned. Use a contact paper with an adhesive back if you want a design you can easily remove."

You can choose from a variety of styles at your local home renovation store, including light bars and small, round \u201cpuck\u201d lights. Some lighting products also feature dimmer switches, which can make the lights softer and more attractive. Use battery-powered LED strips under your cabinets if you don\u2019t want to hardwire lights."
