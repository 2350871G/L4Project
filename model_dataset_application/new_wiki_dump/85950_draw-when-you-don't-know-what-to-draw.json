  "text":" Steps If you would like to, you can set your timer for 10 minutes.  Take a pencil and place it in the center of your paper.  Start the timer and look away so you can't see the paper.  Start drawing. Do not draw anything specific. Just move the pencil around on paper. Try not to take the pencil off the paper at all, so you get one big, curvy line. After ten minutes are up, stop drawing and look at your image. You will probably like what you see. It looks very artistic and yet you can't tell what it is. Although, you are not done yet... Try to find some real-life shapes in your drawing (they are in there, you just have to look for them). Shapes do not have to look real as long as you can tell what it is because you are making an abstract drawing. Once you find some objects, take a pencil and make them stand out by outlining them so you can see them clearly. Find several shapes to make an image. Take some colored pencils, or paints, or anything that can bring color to your image and start coloring the background around your shapes. Once you have a good background, color in the shapes. Colors can be realistic, although your image will look a lot more abstract and interesting if you make colors different then they are supposed to be. You are done! Scribble Method Take a piece of paper and Scribble until you find a shape or something.  When you find a shape or something draw it more together and as a real drawing.  Crumpling Up Method Take a piece of paper and crumple it up. Crumple it up well. Do not rip it, though... Now, take the crumpled piece of paper and open it. Take a pencil and outline all of the folds on the paper (this might take a while.) Try to look for new shapes so viewers actually know what the image is. Once you have an outline, again, take coloring instruments and color it in if you wish.  Random-dot\\/3D method Take a pencil and plot random points on a paper. Do not make the space between points too big. With a pencil, connect all of the lines. Lines have to be connected in special pattern. First you connect all of the dots with lines without intersecting them, thus creating rectangular shapes. In your \"weird rectangles\", connect two points to create a triangle. Do not connect other lines (if you do, instead of triangle you will have an \"X\"). Do this until your image looks like a 3D structure and is filled with triangles.
