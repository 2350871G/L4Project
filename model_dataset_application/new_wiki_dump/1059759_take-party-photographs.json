      "description":"Plan the album cover: If the party is to honor a friend or colleague for their birthday you might want to have a close up picture of the honoree (perhaps holding a sign or wearing a ribbon or hat announcing their birthday) as well as a group picture of everyone attending the party surrounding the honoree. Organize your photo album as a book with many chapters. You might, for example, have chapters for food preparation, the food buffet, the guest of honor arriving, opening gifts, the cake, telling stories, a chapter for each game, and a chapter for the cleanup crew. For the first page of each chapter you might want to get a photograph of the people involved in that activity holding a sign announcing the activity. For the food preparation chapter you might want to have a full page for each person who made a special dish holding their specialty dish with, possibly the recipe for that dish in a text box on the page."
