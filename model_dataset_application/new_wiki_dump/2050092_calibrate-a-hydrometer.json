          "description":"A hydrometer is a glass device that has a bulbous, weighted end designed to float in a liquid and a narrow, long stem with a graduated scale on the other end. It is used to measure the specific gravity of a liquid. Specific gravity is the density of a liquid compared to water. The bulbous end is placed into the liquid in question while the narrow stem will stick out of the liquid. When placed in a liquid, the hydrometer will sink and the reading is taken based on how far it sinks."
