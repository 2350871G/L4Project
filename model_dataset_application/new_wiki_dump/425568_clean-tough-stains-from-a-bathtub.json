          "description":"When cleaning an acrylic bathtub, stay away from harsh astringent powders such as Comet and Ajax, as well as harsh chemicals like bleach. Acrylic is a soft material and is therefore easily damaged. These types of products are almost guaranteed to ruin your tub's finish. It's generally a good idea to start with the gentlest cleaning solution available to you and work your way up to more powerful options if that doesn't work."

          "headline":"Spray the stains with vinegar.",
          "description":"Distilled white vinegar makes an excellent natural cleaning solution, especially on smooth surfaces like acrylic that release stains easily. Fill a spray bottle with vinegar and keep it on hand for routine bathroom cleaning tasks. Apply the vinegar liberally to completely cover the affected area. Lemon juice makes a fine alternative to vinegar if you happen to have some in the refrigerator."

          "headline":"Allow the vinegar to sit for 10-20 minutes.",
          "description":"As it sits, the acidity in the vinegar will break down mold, grime and discoloration so that they can wiped away with ease. You may even see stains begin to dissolve and run off on their own, before you even begin scrubbing. Make sure you give the vinegar ample time to begin working. For especially troublesome spots, sprinkle a little baking soda onto the vinegar as it soaks."

          "headline":"Wipe away the stains with a soft sponge.",
          "description":"The yellow side of a normal dish sponge will do the trick. After being soaked with vinegar, dirt and grime should simply lift off with little difficulty. Use a quick back and forth scrubbing motion, and continue treating the stains until they vanish. You can also use specialty scrubbing tools, like the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, which are made from porous melamine foam for added stain-fighting power."

          "headline":"Rinse out the inside of the tub.",
          "description":"Run the faucet for a few minutes to wash away every last trace of dissolved grime and dirty vinegar solution. If you\u2019re cleaning a bathtub with an adjustable shower head, turn it on and direct the stream over the areas you just treated. Once it\u2019s clean, the tub will need to dry so that stain-causing bacteria doesn\u2019t return. Most bathtub stains are the result of germs that create a filmy residue as they accumulate. Leave the shower curtain drawn and switch on the overhead fan so that the tub receives steady airflow."

Spray the tub down thoroughly, let the vinegar sit for a few minutes, then scrub away the stains using a sponge or stiff-bristled brush. If you discover that vinegar isn't having the desired effect, you can move on to more intensive methods. There will come a point when simply adding more and more vinegar won\u2019t suffice."

Since most of these products contain a similar combination of ingredients, any of them will work as well as another. Just make sure whatever product you choose doesn\u2019t contain bleach, as this can severely weaken the outer enamel layer of the tub. Only buy cleaners that have been approved for use on enamel-coated bathroom surfaces. Be sure to check the label carefully before buying a particular cleaning product so you'll know you\u2019re getting what you need. If possible, open a nearby window, open the door, and turn on a fan to ventilate the bathroom while you clean with any of these products."

All of these ingredients are readily available and safe to use but are quite potent when brought together. Once they're combined, spray the mixture onto the stained surface and give it a few minutes to take effect before wiping it away. If you're having trouble tracking down Castile soap, hydrogen peroxide will make an acceptable substitute. Essential oils like tea tree and peppermint can also act as natural disinfectants."

Wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated area when handling chemical cleaning solutions."

When you\u2019re finished, rinse away any remaining dirt and cleaning solution and let the tub dry completely. If necessary, apply another burst of cleaning solution. Wipe and repeat until the stains come out of the enamel finish. Using anything more abrasive than a sponge to scrub enamel may wear down the finish."

The small particles will be able to penetrate deeper into stains that have set up on the surface of the tub to remove them. Powdered cleansers contain chemicals known as surfactants which have mild abrasive properties. This makes them much more effective for addressing hardened, stuck-on residue. Apply abrasive cleansers sparingly. For most jobs, a single canister be enough for a single thorough cleaning."

Blend the two ingredients together until they're about the same consistency as cake frosting and spread them directly over the stains. After 10 minutes, buff the stains with a nylon brush or pumice stone until they're erased completely. Homemade concoctions like hydrogen peroxide and cream of tartar will be preferable for those who are wary of the health and environmental effects of chemical cleaning products.

Another option is to wet the tub before you apply the cleanser. Spray the tub with the shower head or fill a cup with water and pour it around the inside of the tub.

Work on the stains until they\u2019re completely erased, then rinse the tub with clean water and let it dry before using it again. If you don\u2019t own a dedicated scrubbing brush, you can use the rough green side of a kitchen sponge. Never use steel wool or any similar material to scour a porcelain tub.
