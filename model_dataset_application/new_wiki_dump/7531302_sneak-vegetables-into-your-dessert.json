          "description":"Swap out packaged chocolate mousse or pudding for homemade avocado mousse. Avocado is a heart healthy-vegetables and this recipe will give you a serving of vegetables, making it a great alternative. Melt 1/2 cup of dark or semi sweet chocolate chips in the microwave for 30-60 seconds. Stir until they are all melted and smooth. Scrape down the melted chocolate into a bowl of a food processor. Then add:  four ripe avocados (chopped), 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1/2 cup of honey (more or less to your tastes), 1/2 cup of cocoa powder, a pinch of salt and 1/3 cup of low-fat milk. Process the ingredients until they become smooth and creamy. Taste your mousse and adjust with seasonings if needed. Spoon the avocado mousse equally between four small bowls. Refrigerate for at least three hours or overnight. Serve with a garnish of fresh fruit or mint leaves. If you are preparing this for a child under 12 months, do not add honey.

          "description":"Instead of making a more traditional dessert \u2014 like pie \u2014 try making an easy and quick butternut squash pudding. Roast an entire butternut squash in the oven. Allow the squash to cool, then scoop out the contents and puree until it reaches a smooth and creamy consistency. You can also use 100% pure canned butternut squash if you'd like. In the bowl of a food processor, combine 3/4 cup of your butternut squash puree with 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of maple syrup, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1 tsp of cinnamon, a pinch of salt and 1/4 cup of low-fat milk. Scrape down the sides of the processor bowl and blend again. Then taste your pudding. Adjust for seasonings as needed. Refrigerate your pudding for at least two hours before serving."

Drain two 16 oz cans of canned beets in water. Chop beets roughly so they can be pureed in a food processor. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the chopped beats, 1/3 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of apple juice and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of lemon juice.

They'll be totally concealed by the dark color of the brownies but not affect the delicious chocolate flavor. To start, preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease an 8\"x8\" baking dish with butter or cooking spray. In the bowl of a food processor blender, combine the following ingredients:  three eggs, 1 can of black beans (rinsed and drained), 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup of cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) agave  a pinch of salt, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of instant coffee powder. Blend until completely smooth and combined. Pour brownie batter into the greased baking dish. Sprinkle over 1/2 cup of chocolate chips evenly over the top. Bake about 30 minutes or until the sides of the brownies began to pull away from the sides of the baking dish. Allow to cool for 10 \u2013 15 minutes before slicing and eating. You can add 1/3 cup quick-cooking oats to this recipe for some additional fiber."

Beans work great in desserts because they can be pureed or mashed into a creamy and smooth consistency.

Avocado is a very nutrient-dense vegetable. It's known for being very high in many heart-healthy fats. It's also high in Vitamins E, C, K and the antioxidants lutein and beta carotene. It is also high in calories, however, so keep in mind it will make your dessert more nutritious, but not necessarily low-calorie. Like beans, avocados can be pureed into a smooth and creamy dessert ingredient. Their healthy fats make them very rich and almost decadent which helps make any dessert feel a little more indulgent. Avocados can be added to many desserts; however, their green color might show, so you may want to pick recipes that are chocolate based or are dark colored after they're baked or cooked. You can add avocados to homemade puddings, mousses and ice cream (especially chocolate) and they can even be added to baked goods like chocolate or red velvet cupcakes."

Neither zucchini and yellow squash are overly nutrient-dense; however, they're low in calories and contain a moderate amount of fiber and Vitamin C.\nIf you want to use either zucchini or yellow squash, make sure to shred them finely and squeeze out any liquid before using. They're great used in quick breads, muffins or cakes. You may want to consider peeling them to avoid seeing any flecks of green or yellow in your foods; however, adding chocolate to these dishes can hide any colors (like chocolate zucchini bread)."

Beets are particularly high in some minerals like iron, zinc, copper and selenium. Both carrots and sweet potatoes are also quite nutrient dense. Both of these orange vegetables are high in beta carotene, Vitamin A, potassium, folate and Vitamin E.\nFor any of these vegetables, they'll need to be boiled or roasted and then pureed in order to be used in desserts.

This helps boost the nutrition and helps you meet your daily vegetable needs. Many recipes that use pureed vegetables use the same ratio requirements that are recommended when using applesauce in recipes. It's a 1:1 ratio pureed vegetable to oil. For example, if your recipe calls for 1/4 cup of oil, you'll want to replace that with 1/4 cup of a pureed vegetable (like pumpkin). Although this type of substitution does help improve the nutrition of a dessert, it will change the texture and flavor slightly. It's recommended to let baked goods sit to cool for a minimum of 10 \u2013 15 minutes to prevent crumbling when they're sliced or cut."

Many vegetable dessert recipes call for just a small amount of pureed vegetables. For example, a recipe may only call for 2/3 of a cup of pureed butternut squash. Compared to an entire butternut squash, this is just a small amount and you'll have a lot of leftovers. To help you cut down on unnecessary leftovers, try using canned pureed vegetables. You can generally find items like sweet potatoes, pumpkin and butternut squash in canned form. Make sure you buy 100% pure canned vegetables \u2014 not a mix that has added ingredients.

Vegetables that can be shredded and used in many dessert recipes \u2014 especially baked goods \u2014 include:  zucchini, summer squash, carrots and beets. These can be a great source of extra nutrition in baked goods, but also add a little moisture to your dessert items. Some vegetables, like zucchini, need to be drained so you don't add too much extra liquid to your recipe. This is especially important for baked goods. Most recipes suggest squeezing fresh shredded vegetables in a clean dish towel until all the water is squeezed out."
