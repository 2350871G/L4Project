  "text":" Selecting the items Find a wooden footstool. You'll need to know the dimensions of the footstool before choosing a blanket but in most cases, a single bed blanket will be more than enough for a small stool. Clean it up if needed. Find the blanket. Look for a blanket that has plenty of life left in it and looks hard-wearing. Old military blankets are a good choice (they were usually made of quality wool), as are well woven tartan blankets and blankets from renowned mills. Many vintage blankets can be found online, through auction sites selling collectibles or vintage linens. If the blanket smells of mothballs, hang it outdoors on the clothesline for a few sunny days. The air and sun will fix things for you. Painting the footstool Select a suitable paint color for the footstool's legs and base. It should match the blanket and your home d\u00e9cor. While any color is suitable, don't be afraid to choose metallic colors like silver or gold, as these can look fantastic against the right colored blanket (in fact, metallic colors will suit most other color combinations). If the stool looks lovely enough without painting, you can skip this section. Sand the legs and sides of the footstool. This will remove old paint or varnish and makes the surface nicely smooth for the new paint. Cover the cushion section of the stool in plastic. Tape to the edges to prevent the paint going onto it. While you won't see this cushion anymore, you'll avoid stiffening parts of the cushion where the paint sets if you do this (plus, it wastes paint to have it bleed into the cushion area). Paint the stool. Either paint with a brush or using spray paint. Ensure that the work surface is well covered and that the area is well ventilated. Allow to dry before proceeding. Making the stool cover Measure the footstool top. Cut the blanket to fit the top, taking into account the sides of the cushion as well as the surface measurement. Leave a two inch (5cm) seam. Drape the blanket top over the footstool cushion. Align it to sit evenly all the way around the cushion top. Attach the blanket top. Where possible, push the blanket top into any edgings around the cushion where it attaches to the base of the footstool. This is why you leave the seam. At the corners, neatly fold the blanket fabric and tuck into place. Each corner should look neatly finished off. Wrap grosgrain ribbon around the entire base of the blanket top (where it meets the wood). Pin the ribbon into place before wrapping around, then where the ribbon end meets the beginning again, once more attach with sewing pins. It's likely you'll need to tap in a few sewing pins all the way around, to ensure that the ribbon remains in place until the next step is completed. Hammer in the upholstery tacks. Follow the line of the grosgrain ribbon and evenly space the tacks as you go. Watch for fingers and remove any sewing pins as you head around the stool. Adding a bow Make a large bow from the grosgrain or velvet ribbon. Add a dab of glue where it joins, to dissuade it from unraveling. Where the ribbon joins on the footstool, tack the ribbon bow right over it. This can be either the front or the back of the stool, as wished. In fact, you can place a ribbon on the other side in the same spot if you'd like to even it up and make it impossible to guess where the join is (and save people from having to guess which is the front and which is the back). Done. You can now rest your weary feet on a designer style footstool, made by yours truly.",
