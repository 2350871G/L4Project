This will get rid of some of the chlorine in the tap water. This isn't essential however, and your cuttings may be fine in tap water. After you see roots of about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) length, plant them into moist compost. Again, keep them out of direct sun for a few months until the roots are a bit more established."
