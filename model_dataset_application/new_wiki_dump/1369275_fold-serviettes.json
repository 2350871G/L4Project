Cocktail napkins are generally too small to fold, but most other napkins will be large enough for most fancy serviette folds. Cocktail napkins are usually six to 9 inches square (15 to 23 cm). Tea, luncheon, and hors d\u2019oeuvre napkins are between 12 and 16 inches square (30 to 41 cm). Lunch, buffet, and informal dinner napkins range from 18 to 24 inches square (46 to 61 cm). Serviettes for formal or multiple course meals generally range between 22 and 26 inches square (56 to 66 cm)."

Fold the next two layers down in a staggered fashion like you did with the diamond fold. Leave the last layer unfolded. Fold the sides of the diamond in to the center. Flip the serviette over.
