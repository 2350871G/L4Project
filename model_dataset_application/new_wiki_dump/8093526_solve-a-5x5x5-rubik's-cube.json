If you see x\u2019 or y\u2019 in the algorithm, perform these actions in reverse. Finding the Centers Form a small cross with the F R\u2019 D\u2019 R F2 algorithm. To make the puzzle-solving process less overwhelming, start solving the centers of the large Rubik\u2019s cube. In this case, pretend that you\u2019re tinkering with a generic, 3x3x3 cube instead of the more complex puzzle. To start, try using the F R\u2019 D\u2019 R F2 algorithm to get a cross on the upper layer of the cube. This algorithm is most commonly used on 3x3x3 cubes. For more information on algorithms specific to 5x5x5 cubes, check out this resource: https://protofusion.org/idiots_guide_to_rubiks_cube/oldsite/5x5x5.html. Make sure that you have a center cross/plus sign in the middle of each cube face before continuing. Find the centers using U\u2019 R\u2019 U R\u2019 U\u2019 2R U. Begin filling in a solid 3x3x3 center on each cube face by rotating the upper layer of the cube in a counter-clockwise \u00bc turn. Next, turn the right face of the cube in a counter-clockwise \u00bc turn. Take the algorithm one step at a time. If you think you\u2019ve made a mistake, try turning the cube in the opposite direction that you just rotated it in. Follow the U R\u2019 U\u2019 portion of the center algorithm. After completing the first 2 steps of the puzzle, continue by rotating the upper face of the cube in a clockwise \u00bc turn. Next, turn the right face of the cube in a counter-clockwise \u00bc turn. Finally, rotate the upper face again, but in a counter-clockwise \u00bc turn. Pay close attention to the apostrophes in any Rubik\u2019s cube algorithm. The can be easy to miss! Finish finding the centers with 2R U. Proceed by rotating the right face of the cube in a clockwise \u00bd turn. Next, complete the algorithm by turning the upper face in a clockwise \u00bc turn. This is the only portion of the algorithm that involves a \u00bd turn. Aligning the Edges of the Cube Use the R U\u2019 R\u2019 and F R\u2019 F\u2019 R algorithms first. Choose a method to begin adjusting the edges on your 5x5x5 Rubik\u2019s cube. For the first algorithm, rotate the right face clockwise, the upper face counter-clockwise, and the right face counter-clockwise. To solve the second algorithm, turn the front face clockwise, the right face counter-clockwise, the front face counter-clockwise, and the right face clockwise. Choose 1 or the other to start aligning the edges, as you don\u2019t need to use both. Keep in mind that all of these rotations will be \u00bc turns. Flip the edge with the R U R\u2019 F R\u2019 F\u2019 R algorithm. Adjust the front-right edge by turning the right cube face clockwise, then rotating the upper face in a clockwise direction as well. Continue by turning the right face counter-clockwise, the front face clockwise, the right face counter-clockwise again, and the front face counter-clockwise. Finish by rotating the right face clockwise. All of these cube rotations are still going to be \u00bc turns. Solve the edges with Uw\u2019 (R U R\u2019 F R\u2019 F\u2019 R) Uw. Once you\u2019ve assembled most of the edges together, use a \u201cslice-flip-slice\u201d technique to complete the last few edges without messing up the center colors. All of these rotations will be \u00bc turns. First, rotate the top 2 layers of the cube in a counter-clockwise direction. Next, \u201cflip\u201d the colors of the cube by rotating the right face clockwise, the upper clockwise, the right face counter-clockwise, the front face clockwise, the right face counter-clockwise, the front face counter-clockwise, and the right face clockwise. Finally, finish off the algorithm by rotating the top 2 layers of the cube clockwise. Use a special algorithm to get rid of the parities. Follow the Rw U2 x Rw U2 Rw U2 Rw\u2019 U2 Lw U2 3Rw\u2019 U2 Rw U2 Rw\u2019 U2 Rw\u2019 algorithm when you go to remove the parities, or mismatched cubes. First, rotate 2 of the rightmost layers in a clockwise \u00bc turn, then turn the upper face in a clockwise \u00bd turn. Physically roll the entire cube backward before proceeding. Next, turn 2 right layers clockwise in a \u00bc turn, 1 upper layer clockwise in a \u00bd turn, 2 right layers clockwise in a \u00bc turn again, and 1 upper layer clockwise in a \u00bd turn again. Continue following this algorithm until there are no more parities leftover on the cube. This algorithm repeats itself a lot, so do your best to keep track of how many steps you\u2019ve completed.
