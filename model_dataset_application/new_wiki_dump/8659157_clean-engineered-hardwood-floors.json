          "description":"Loose pieces of dirt and small stones may be tracked into your house on a daily basis. Use a soft-bristled broom to sweep up all of the dirt in your house. Pay special attention to areas that are more likely to have collected dirt or rocks, such as the entryway. Sweep the dirt and dust into a dustpan, and dispose of it outside. If left on the engineered hardwood floor, these will be ground into its surface and can scuff or damage the top layer of hardwood. If left on the floor, dirt and rocks can also scratch the veneer on top of the hardwood flooring. To keep your engineered hardwood in good shape, clean them frequently. To maximize the floor\u2019s durability, aim to sweep or vacuum the floors daily."

          "description":"If you\u2019d prefer not to use a broom\u2014or want to make doubly sure that you\u2019ve cleaned up all dirt from the hardwood\u2014you can use a vacuum cleaner on the floor. Make sure to set the cleaner on the \u201chard floor\u201d mode. This will disable the rotating bristle bar. If left engaged, the rotating bristle bar will scratch and scuff the veneer surface of your floor. If you scratch your engineered hardwood floor with a bristle bar, the damage may be irreversible."

          "description":"Use a microfiber mop to clean the floor and ensure that you\u2019ve cleaned up all dust that\u2019s been tracked or blown into your house. A dry microfiber mop head will effectively pick up any dirt and debris on the floor\u2014including some that your broom may have missed\u2014and you won\u2019t risk damaging your floor with water. Mop your hardwood flooring at least once a week. Plan to only mop your engineered hardwood with a microfiber mop. This material will be less abrasive on the veneer and top layer of your hardwood floor than the head of a regular mop would be, and you won\u2019t need to use any water."

          "description":"You may not have, or prefer not to use, a microfiber mop. In this case, you can use a traditional yarn mop to clean your floor. Wring out water from your mop thoroughly before you apply the mop to the hardwood. Make sure that your mop is slightly damp; you don\u2019t need much liquid to effectively clean a hardwood floor. If excess water remains on the hardwood flooring after you\u2019ve mopped, clean this up with a towel. A slightly damp yarn mop can also remove any light stains from liquids that may have spilled on the floor."

A rug will catch much of the dirt, dust, and grime that would otherwise be tracked on your hardwood flooring. Try placing one rug outside each entrance, for visitors to wipe any dirt or mud off of their feet. Then, another rug placed inside the doorway will let visitors wipe their feet again, this time removing finer dirt or dust. Shake your rug outside weekly, to prevent dust from the rug itself being tracked through the rest of the house."
