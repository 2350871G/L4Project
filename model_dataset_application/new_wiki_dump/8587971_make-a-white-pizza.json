It should be approximately 12 inches (30-cm) in diameter and \u00bc-inch (6-mm) thick. You can use homemade pizza dough or purchase dough from the grocery store or local pizzeria. If you\u2019re having trouble stretching out the dough, you may want to use a rolling pin to help roll it out. It\u2019s okay if the dough is slightly thicker than \u00bc-inch (6-mm) along the edge of the circle. That will form a nice crust."

Next, carefully transfer the stretched out dough to the peel.
