Brush softer vegetables, like peppers and tomatoes, with a cloth or your hand. You don\u2019t need to use soaps, detergents, or special cleaners to wash produce."

For vegetables like carrots, potatoes, and cucumbers, the skins are edible and you can leave them on if you wish. Fruit and vegetable skins contain lots of nutrients, so if you aren't worried about aesthetics, leave the skins on instead of peeling them."

Trim off the tapered tops and bottoms so you have a 2-inch (5-cm) long rectangular piece of vegetable to work with, which will make it easier to cut the vegetables into uniform pieces.>\nInstead of throwing out the excess that you\u2019ve cut off, consider saving it for soups, juices, or other dishes. Cylindrical vegetables that need to be squared include carrots, potatoes, zucchini, eggplant, and cucumbers."

Cut the fruit in half through the middle, rather than in half from stem to bottom. For tomatoes, use your finger to pick out the seeds and juice from the middle if you're making a salsa or other dish that you don\u2019t want to be runny."
