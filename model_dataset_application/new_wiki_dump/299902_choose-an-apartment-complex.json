If the apartment is not what you're looking for, jot down why (e.g. \"no pets\" or \"no apartments available\"). Give the person the information they need: When you want to move (e.g. \"between March 1st and 15th\"), what you're looking for (how many bedrooms? ), and your price range (e.g. less than $800). If you have a pet, include this information early on. If they have anything available that meets your needs, ask if you can make an appointment to visit and see the apartments they have available. Sometimes, the unit that meets your needs will not be available for showing until close to your move-in date. If this is inconvenient, ask if they can show you an apartment like it, and request a floor plan of the unit in question. You can also ask to see the outside of the unit, which will give you an idea of the kind of view you'll have and what your neighbors might be like. Try to schedule apartments that are in the same area at around the same time. If you're not careful when planning this, you might end up going back and forth from one end of town to the other between appointments."
