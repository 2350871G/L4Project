      "description":"In theory, placing a sheet of aluminum behind your router will help focus your Wi-Fi toward your preferred source with increased power, thus increasing the range. This can help you stay connected to the Internet on items like consoles or desktop computers that are just outside of your Wi-Fi's range. This is unlikely to work if your preferred item is more than a few feet outside of your router's Wi-Fi range."
