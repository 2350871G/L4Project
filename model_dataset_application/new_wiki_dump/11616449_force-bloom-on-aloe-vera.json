          "description":"Different areas of your home may experience changes in light as the sun moves. Keep note of the sunniest spots and move your aloe vera plant accordingly to give it at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight per day. For instance, place it on your kitchen windowsill so it gets 3 or 4 hours of morning light. Then, move it to a table in your dining or living room for 3 or 4 more hours of midday and afternoon sunshine. Do this every day during the winter and spring months to increase the chances that your aloe vera plant will bloom. The aloe plant will not bloom in any season other than spring, so don\u2019t try to force it to bloom during the summer, fall, or winter."

          "description":"Sudden temperature changes can cause the leaves to turn brown. Keep the plant in an environment with a stable temperature between 55\u00b0F and 80\u00b0F (13\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C). Placing the plant in direct sunlight in a room that\u2019s already relatively warm could be too much heat for the plant, so be mindful and check the leaves for signs of burning. Don\u2019t put the plant in a place where its leaves are touching a window. The excess heat or cold coming from the window could burn the leaves and cause browning. If you see any brown sunspots appear on the leaves, move the plant to a cooler room and only give it indirect sunlight for 4 to 5 days until the sunspots go away. Avoid placing the plant next to a heater, A/C unit, fan, television, or any other source of heat or drafts."

          "description":"The easiest way to make your aloe vera plant bloom is to give it more direct sunlight. The ideal temperature for aloe vera plants to bloom is 70\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F (21\u00b0C to 29\u00b0C), so if you live in an area with a mild climate, move your plant outside. If it gets colder than 60\u00b0F at night where you live, you\u2019ll need to bring your plant inside. Choose a spot that gets at least 8 hours of direct sunlight."

          "description":"An indoor grow lamp is the perfect solution to make up for cloudy days. Choose a white fluorescent or a red or blue LED grow lamp and position it next to your aloe vera plant. Adjust the head so the light shines directly on the leaves from above. The distance from the bulb to the leaves depends on the size of your plant. For example, if your plant is 10 inches (25 cm) to 18 inches (46 cm) wide, position the bulb 10 inches (25 cm) to 18 inches (46 cm) away from the top of the plant. A white fluorescent LED lamp will give you a soft, white light that will complement any room, but a red or blue LED lamp might be better able to give your plant the right kind of photosynthetic light it needs. If you notice the leaves start to turn brown after using a grow lamp, decrease the power of the lamp if you can or, decrease the amount of time you use the lamp. If you have 2 plants that are each 6 inches (15 cm) across, place them side by side and adjust the bulb so it\u2019s 12 inches (30 cm) away from the tops of the plants."

          "description":"Wait until the top 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) of soil is dry before watering the plant. It\u2019s important to let it dry out a little between waterings because too much moisture can cause root rot, bruises on the leaves, and attract diseases. If you\u2019re not sure, stick your finger into the top 3 inches (7.6 cm) of soil to feel for moisture. Exposing the plant to more light will make it dry out faster, so stick to a regular schedule so your plant doesn\u2019t get too dry if you forget to do it on the 7th day. If the soil is slightly damp near the tip of your finger, don\u2019t water it for another 1 or 2 days. If it\u2019s sopping wet, leave it alone for 1 week. Slowly pour water onto the soil until you notice water draining from the pot\u2019s drainage hole. If you\u2019ve placed your aloe vera plant outside, bring it inside or cover it when it rains so it doesn\u2019t take in too much water."

Use the same amount of water suggested on the package so the fertilizer is half as strong. For instance, if the directions on the package say to mix 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of fertilizer with 128 fluid ounces (3,800 mL), use 1/4 teaspoon (1 to 1.3 g) instead."
