          "description":"Since agave is derived from a plant, it is considered vegan, unlike honey which comes from bees. Agave is deemed a viable, natural sweetener for those following a vegan diet. Agave does not crystallize as honey sometimes does because it is high in fructose. While honey has a unique taste and imparts its flavor to the food that is being sweetened, agave has a subtler flavor and lends little or no taste to a dish or beverage. Agave tastes sweeter than honey because of higher fructose content. Honey is not recommended for children under the age of 1 due to the presence of a few botulism spores. Agave may be consumed by people of all ages. Agave has a thinner consistency than honey. Agave is great for adding body fat because of the high fructose content."
