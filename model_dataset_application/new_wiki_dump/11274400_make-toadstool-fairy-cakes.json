  "text":" Making the Cakes Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C (356\u00b0F or 4 on a gas oven). If you preheat the oven beforehand the oven will be ready when you need to put the cakes in. Soften the butter in a microwave. Put the butter in a microwavable bowl and put it in the microwave on a low power level for a minute. The butter should be soft but not melted. Combine the butter with the sugar. Whisk them together or use an electrical mixer until the mixture is light, pale and creamy. Sieve in the flour and add in the eggs and vanilla extract. Mix everything together well. Add in some white chocolate drops into the mixture if you desire. Mix well. This step is optional but it works well for these cakes. Line a cupcake tin with 12 fairy cake or cupcake cases and spoon the mixture equally into the cases. The cakes will rise so don't fill the cases to the top. Bake the cakes in the oven for 15-20 minutes. Put a skewer into the largest cake if it comes out clean they are done, if it comes out with some batter leave them in the oven for a few minutes longer. Leave to cool at room temperature on a wire rack.  Decorating the Cakes Combine the icing sugar with the food colouring in a measuring jug. If the icing is too powdery add a tablespoon of warm water add more water until the consistency isn't too runny or too powdery. Spoon some icing onto each fairy cake. Spread the icing with the back of the spoon or a flat knife. The whole top of the cake should ideally be covered in icing. Add the white chocolate drops onto the cakes. Put them on so the pointy end of the drops are in the icing and the flat side of the drop is facing up. There should be about 5-6 chocolate drops on each cake",
