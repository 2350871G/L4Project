  "text":" Preparing the Onions Heat the oil. Place the olive oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Let the oil heat up in preparation for sauteing the onions. Add the onions. Place all the onions in the hot oil. Use a spatula to stir them around and distribute them evenly across the bottom of the skillet. Let the onions caramelize. Cook the onions until they become soft and brown, but not burned. The caramelization process usually takes about 35 minutes. Stir the onions occasionally to keep them from burning. Some cooks add a teaspoon of sugar to the onions to bring out their sweet flavor and help with caramelization. Don't rush the caramelization step; it's what lends French onion soup its deep, rich flavor. You may need to turn down the heat if the onions are cooking too quickly. If they begin to smoke, turn it down to medium low. Making the Soup Base Add the garlic to the onions. Once the onions are caramelized, add the minced garlic. Stir the garlic to distribute it evenly and let it cook for one minute. Add the stock and wine. Pour in the stock first, using a spatula to loosen the onions and garlic from the bottom of the pan and stir them into the stock. Pour in the wine and give it another stir. Season the soup. Add the bay leaf and thyme to the soup. Taste the soup and add salt and pepper. Cover the saucepan and let the soup simmer so the flavors meld for about half an hour. Check the seasonings once more. After the soup has simmered, remove the lid and taste it again. Add more salt and pepper to taste. Find the bay leaf and throw it away. Finishing the Soup Turn on the broiler. If your oven doesn't have a broiler, turn the oven to 400 degrees. Ladle the soup into bowls. Use oven-safe bowls or ramekins, since the final step is to place the bowls in the oven. If you don't have oven-safe bowls or ramekins, ladle the soup into a casserole dish. Cover the soup with toasted bread. Slice the French or Italian bread and toast it in the toaster until it is well done. Distribute toast slices across the surface of the soup. Sprinkle the cheese on the toasted bread. Put an equal amount of cheese on each piece of bread. Add more or less cheese depending on your tastes. Melt the cheese. Place the bowls, ramekins or casserole dish in the oven. Broil the soup until the cheese on the bread has melted and started to bubble and brown. Remove the soup from the oven and serve hot. Finished. ",
