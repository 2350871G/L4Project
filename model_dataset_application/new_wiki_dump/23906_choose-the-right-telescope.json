      "description":"Larger diameter lenses or mirrors allow higher resolution (ability to separate closely spaced objects) and will gather more light from faint astronomical objects. They also cost more. A good size for a first telescope is roughly four inches (100mm). Bigger tends to be considerably more expensive and more inconvenient. Bigger works better, of course, though not shockingly so."

      "headline":"Too much magnification just gives you a useless blur.",
      "description":"A good rule of thumb to determine the maximum usable magnification is to multiply the diameter of the objective in millimeters by 2.5 (which means that the typical department store 60mm scope is only usable to 150x). In actual practice, on nights of extremely unusual atmospheric stability, you -may- be able to use a somewhat higher power, but don't count on it."
