Next, mix in 1 teaspoon (3 g) cornstarch to thicken up the sauce and set aside. If you want a thinner sauce, you can omit the cornstarch."

Let the oil heat for another 1 to 2 minutes. If you don\u2019t have vegetable oil in your pantry, you can substitute olive oil."

          "description":"Once the oil is heated, turn the heat up to medium high and place 1 pound (450 g) ground chicken in the skillet. Use a wooden spoon to break up the chicken, and allow it to cook until it is no longer pink, which usually takes 4 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a dish, and set aside. Make sure to drain the excess fat from the ground chicken before transferring it to a dish. You may want to cover the ground chicken with foil after you remove it from the heat to keep it somewhat warm. If you prefer, you can substitute ground turkey for the ground chicken. You can also swap the ground chicken for sliced or chopped grilled chicken. If you\u2019re in a hurry, you can even purchase a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, cut the meat off of it, and mix it in with the vegetables and sauce."
