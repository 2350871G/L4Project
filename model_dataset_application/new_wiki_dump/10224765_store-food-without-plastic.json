A cloth bag will allow the vegetables to breathe, keeping them fresher when you decide to use them. There are no special cloth bags for food, so using any cloth bag at a local supermarket will work."

The water will keep the vegetables fresh and crispy for when you need to use them again. This technique is great for carrots, parsnips, spring onions or even potatoes. Root vegetables are fine to be openly exposed in a fridge as they rarely have a strong smell."
