          "description":"Add about 2 cups (470 ml) of oil to a large skillet or frying pan. Heat the oil over medium-high heat for 5-10 minutes, until it reaches 350 F (177 C). If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, you can tell the oil is ready when it\u2019s shimmering but not smoking. Ideal oils for frying tortilla chips are vegetable and canola."

          "headline":"Stack and cut the tortillas.",
          "description":"Arrange your tortillas into four neat piles. This will make the tortillas easier to cut into wedges for chips. Use a sharp knife to cut the tortillas in half, and then cut each half into three even wedges. Repeat until all the tortillas have been cut. For smaller chips, cut each tortilla half into four wedges. You can either use store-bought or homemade tortillas to make these chips."

          "headline":"Fry the chips in small batches.",
          "description":"When the oil is ready and the chips have been cut, add 10 to 20 chips to the oil. Make sure the chips aren't crowding each other, or they won\u2019t cook evenly. Cook the chips for about two minutes, until golden brown. Flip the chips and cook them for another two minutes."

          "description":"When the chips are golden brown on both sides, carefully remove them from the hot oil. Hold the slotted spoon over the skillet for a minute to allow excess oil to drain off. Transfer the chips to a towel-lined baking sheet. Line a baking sheet with a layer of paper towel. Transfer the cooked chips to the baking sheet and set them aside to cool. As they cool, the paper towel will absorb more of the excess oil. Repeat until all the chips have been fried, removed from the oil, and transferred to the baking sheet."

          "headline":"Sprinkle with salt and serve warm or cold.",

As soon as the chips are cool to the touch, they're ready to be enjoyed with your favorite dips, or as part of other dishes. You can also season the chips with pepper, garlic powder, herbs, and other spices and seasonings."
