          "description":"Lines can help her get her proportion correct, which in turn makes her handwriting more readable. If she's having trouble with it, show her the best way to do it. Use primary handwriting sheets that have colored lines as guides for each letter. Capital letters should go from the top line to the bottom line, and they should be twice the size of a lowercase letter. Also, help her make sure her letters don't float or sink by always positioning the bottom of the letter (with the exception of tails) on the line. One way to help her get this right is to highlight the bottom half of the space. Tell her the small letters need to stay within the color and that only capital letters can extend above it."

          "description":"That is, letters should be made from the top down, for the most part. Also, your kid should work from left to right. Try watching how your kid writes. How she writes may surprise you. If you notice your kid making letters abnormally, take her hand and help her make the correct motion. Practice making letters with the correct motions regularly. Make practice fun so the activity stays desirable."

          "headline":"Work on spacing words.",
          "description":"Have your kid place her finger on the paper after the word. Tell her to start the next word on the other side of her finger. This process will help her space out her words properly, which can make her handwriting look better overall. If she's left-handed, try a popsicle stick instead. You can also have her make a small dot after each word so she knows to leave a space."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Work on tracing.",
          "description":"One way you can show her how handwriting should look is to have her trace handwriting. You can buy handwriting books for tracing, or you can simply write on a piece of paper. Make sure to make your handwriting as standard as possible if you are doing it yourself. Also, make sure to not write too small, as that will make it harder for your child. Have your child trace over the letters first with her pencil. Next, have her write the letters again underneath the traced letters."

        {
          "headline":"Help your child distinguish similar letters.",
          "description":"Some letters are commonly confused or put backward. For instance, the lowercase \"b\" and \"d\" are often confused. One way to help your child is to tell them to \"make their bed\" by making two thumbs up symbols and bumping them together, forming a \"bed.\" The left side looks like a lowercase \"b\" and the right side looks like a lowercase \"d.\"\nAnother commonly confused pair is Ws and Ms. One trick you can use is to mix up a bunch of Ms and Ws on a page and have your child circle all the Ms or all the Ws."

          "headline":"Teach her how to form letters.",
          "description":"If your child has trouble remembering how letters are formed, you may need to go over them again with her. Making up little stories as you go along can help, such as \"T is a single line that likes to wear a hat across the top.\" One option for helping them to remember how to form letters is to make a box with landmarks. For instance, make a box with a star in the upper left hand corner. For an \"H,\" you could say, \"Start at the star, go all the way down the side to make a wall. Make a wall on the other side, then connect them across the middle.\" Repeat practicing each letter so your child can master them."

        {
          "headline":"Get in as much practice as you can.",
          "description":"One of the best ways to help a child is to get her to practice as much as she can. Try to sneak writing in throughout the day so your child is constantly practicing. For instance, have her take down a grocery list for you. Another good way to practice is to have her write letters to friends or relatives. Another way is to pass notes. That is, leave her notes, and in them, ask her to write back. It can be a fun little game you play together. Alternatively, make a book together. Tape, staple, or glue a few pages together, and have her write a story."

Plus, it makes the whole process a lot more enjoyable for your child, who will see it as a game rather than work. For example, try putting shaving cream on the table, and have her write letters in it. You can also use sand or rice. Another option is finger painting letters."

Some people also swear by vibrating pens, saying that they can help solidify letter shapes in your child's mind. If her writing instruments are colorful or sparkly, your child will be more inclined to want to use them. Crayons are also a good option."

Kids should sit up straight, with their back all the way to the back of the chair. Feet should be flat on the floor with knees at a 90-degree angle.

Your child may not realize he needs to tilt his paper before he writes to accommodate the angle of his wrist. The angle can help improve his handwriting, as it makes it easier to form letters. Show him how to tilt the paper 45 degrees to the right if he's right-handed. If he's left-handed, tilt it to the left 45 degrees."
