These two fruits have different bagging requirements, so keep them in mind as you store them. Lemons belong in plastic bags. Make sure the plastic bag is closed tightly so the lemons are safe from any exposed air. This will keep them from losing their moisture and turning hard and dry. You may either leave your grapes in the bag you bought them in or transfer them to a new one. Paper sacks provide the best storage due to their absorbing properties."

If you plan to eat them soon, it\u2019s fine to refrigerate them. However, if you aren\u2019t planning on using them right away, go ahead and store them in your freezer.
