So run around your town, and every time you see a villager stop and talk to them by pressing A. When talking to the villagers, make sure you don\u2019t pick the bottom option, which is always some version of \u201cNevermind.\u201d Choosing this option will end the conversation. Instead, pick the options that are long the lines of \u201cHow are you?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Those options will prompt the villagers to ask you for a favor if they currently have one.

If you really want to get a large number of favors to complete, you need to talk to villagers often. If you talk to them too much in abort space of time they will become overwhelmed and suggest you leave them alone for a while."

Once you have a favor to do, do it on the same day that they are accepted. If one of your villagers asks you to catch him a shark, for example, but you can\u2019t catch a shark until the next day, then there is no point in accepting the request.

Afterwards, you can successfully leave and they will say it was nice to have you over.
