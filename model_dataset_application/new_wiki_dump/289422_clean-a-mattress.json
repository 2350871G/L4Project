Start by removing the top layer of items, including pillows, decorative pillows, blankets, toys, and other objects. When you remove your pillows for sleeping, take the pillow cases off and throw them in the laundry basket. Fold up blankets and move items from the bed to a different part of the room so they're out of the way when you clean."

Wash the sheets, linens, and pillow cases in the washing machine while the mattress is being cleaned. That way, you'll start with a completely fresh bed. Read and follow care labels when washing any fabrics. Use the hottest water and dryer settings possible to kill any bacteria or dust mites that may be hiding in your linens. If you use a duvet, remove the cover and wash it with the linens as well."

For a memory foam mattress, use only the smallest amount of cleaner possible, because memory foam should never get wet. This solution will be effective to treat stains from dirt, food, drinks.

During the warmer seasons, open a window in the room to let in fresh air and dry out the mattress faster.
