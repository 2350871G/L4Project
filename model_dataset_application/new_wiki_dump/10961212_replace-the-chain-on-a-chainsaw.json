Also, consult the safety manual that came with your chainsaw for any other recommended safety equipment to wear or safety tips to follow. While you won\u2019t need to turn your chainsaw on while you replace the chain, you may want to test it afterward.

If it moves, the brake has been disengaged.

Place the drive socket around one of the nuts and twist in a counter-clockwise motion until the nut comes loose. Place the nut on a workbench or table, and repeat with the second nut.

After you pull the guide bar off of it, grip the guide bar between your thumb and forefinger, and pull it away from the handle until you see the chain has become slack. Detaching the bar from the rest of the chainsaw is the easiest way to replace a chain, although you can pull the chain off by pulling the nose forward on some models. Use this opportunity to determine if you should sharpen or polish the blade as well."
