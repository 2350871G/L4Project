Adding too much water will not allow enough room for it to move back down to the bottom of the bottle during your flip.

Sit cross-legged on a hard, non-carpeted floor and place the bottle on the floor in front of you."

If you want to use the floor instead, you can do so. Sit cross-legged on a hard, non-carpeted floor and place the bottle on the floor in front of you. Flipping Your Water Bottle Grip the bottle between your fingertips and thumb on its neck near the cap. Place your fingertips and thumb around the top of the neck of the bottle so that your hand is hovering over, but not touching, the cap. Grip it tightly so when you flip it, the bottom of the bottle goes up into the air. Your hand will look a bit like a claw if it\u2019s in the right holding position.

Troubleshooting Your Technique Be sure your water level is correct.
