Then rinse it off with a clean sponge or damp rag. This will help sanitize your wood countertops. Use hot water to rinse the vinegar off the countertop, as this will help clean and maintain your countertops even more effectively. Don\u2019t let the vinegar sit for more than a few minutes, as the acidic properties can make the wood glue deteriorate over time.

Claudia & Angelo Zimmermann\t\t\tCleaning Gurus & Founders, Cleaning Studio\t\t\t\tTry using microfiber cloths and a pH neutral wood cleaner for an even gentler clean. First, fold a clean, dry microfiber cloth in quarters and dust your wooden countertop, changing sides as needed. Then, fold a second microfiber in quarters and spray your wood cleaner onto the cloth\u2014not directly onto the wood\u2014and wipe the surface. You can then add a few drops of lemon or orange essential oil to add more shine to your countertops."

If you have any residue that is particularly difficult to remove, consider using a spatula or metal pastry scraper to remove any additional buildup. Be sure to use these tools gently to avoid scraping the wood and leaving a permanent mark."

Apply the iron to the area of the cloth covering the stain and leave it there for a very brief moment.

After giving it a good once over with the 120-grit paper, switch to a piece of 180-grit sandpaper and sand the countertops, again keeping with the natural grain of the wood. This should help remove any tough stains on the surface of the wood. Once you finish sanding, you\u2019ll need to apply mineral oil and rub it into the wood grain with a clean rag. Let it soak into the wood for about 30 minutes, and then wipe away any excess mineral oil residue with a paper towel. Be sure to choose a food-safe mineral oil. You can also use walnut oil for the same effect. Avoid using culinary oils because they can oxidize and become rancid over time."

Take care when using liquids in your kitchen and try to soak up any spills on the countertops as soon as they occur. This means you should also avoid leaving your wet dishes to dry directly on the wood countertop. Even with a dishtowel underneath them, this could potentially damage your countertops over time.

If you clean your counters regularly, they will be less likely to stain and will require sanding/re-oiling less frequently. This is especially true for any liquid spills or if there are lots of food scraps left on the countertops. Consider using a plastic mat when completing messy tasks in the kitchen.
