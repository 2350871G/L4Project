Some herbs that work well with steamed oysters include parsley and cilantro, while spices such as cloves and paprika can also be found in these dishes. Steamed oysters can be cooked with either white wine or olive oil. They can also be made with both! Use 2-3 tablespoons of either wine or olive oil. If you are cooking with both, use a combined total of 2-3 tablespoons."
