      "description":"Inside, draw a pretty big black circle inside it. Those will be the pupils. You can make the pupils any color, but you can also make no pupil at all. If you decide to make it without any pupil, your dragon will get a more scarier, fierce look."

      "headline":"Draw the nose of the dragon by drawing a sort of four-leaf clover then draw the snout - making it like a trunk of a palm tree.",
      "description":"If you are already in the mouth part, erase a bit of the snout and make a line that leads onto the mouth. If you want to, you can make the mouth of your dragon open and also add a tongue like in the picture. Don't forget to add the sharp teeth! The dragon is nothing with out sharp and menacing teeth."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Draw the neck and scales.",
      "description":"Do you notice the orange things coming out of the back of the dragon? This is what separates the Chinese dragons from the fairytale dragons. When you draw the neck, make sure it looks elegant yet chunky and ugly. On the front of the neck, make sure you draw a patch of color on it. Remember to add scales in the back."

    {
      "headline":"Draw the body.",
      "description":"Make sure to make the body all tangled together like a spaghetti noodle. Or you can make the body all in a swaying way. Remember to draw the scales and the almost flaming things in the back."

      "headline":"Color it.",
      "description":"Chinese dragons can be bright colors, like red and orange, or dark colors like purple and blue. Color your dragon for a realistic affect."
