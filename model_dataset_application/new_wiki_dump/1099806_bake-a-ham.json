A standard kitchen knife is about 8 inches (20 cm) long, so you only need to push the very top of it into the ham to get the right cuts. Make about 18-20 cuts and set them 0.25 in (0.64 cm) apart. Do not use a butter knife to do this. Otherwise, the meat won\u2019t get proper exposure to the oven\u2019s heat.Did you know?
