          "description":"To make your potato cage, you'll need flexible but sturdy wire mesh that\u2019s 5 feet (1.5 m) (152 cm) long and 3 feet (0.91 m) (91 cm) tall. Take the length of wire mesh and wrap the ends toward each other to form a cylindrical cage with two open ends. Starting with a piece of wire mesh this size will produce a circular cage with a 2-foot (61-cm) diameter. You can also use premade tomato cages instead of making your own."

          "description":"When you\u2019ve folded the ends of the cage together, overlap them by about an inch (2.5 cm). Secure the ends together by tying them with twine or fastening them with zip ties. This will prevent the cage from opening up."

          "headline":"Find a sunny location for the cage.",

          "description":"When you\u2019ve found the ideal spot for your potatoes, dig a hole in the ground that\u2019s about 6 inches (15 cm) deep and about the same diameter as your cage. Place the cage in the hole and pack the exterior base with extra soil. Along with removing weeds and other competition from the area, embedding the cage in the ground will also help to secure it and prevent it from blowing over in the wind. Use wire stakes to secure the cage to the ground if you think blowing over will be an issue."

This isn't strictly necessary, but the newspaper will keep the soil inside the cage if the openings in the wire mesh are too large. You can also use straw to line the cage if you prefer."

          "description":"Potatoes prefer cooler weather, so it\u2019s important to plant them in late winter or early spring. The ideal time is two weeks after the last frost. In warmer areas where the ground doesn\u2019t freeze during winter, you can actually plant your potatoes in the late fall."

For seed potatoes that don\u2019t yet have any sprouts, lay them out in a bright room for two weeks prior to planting to encourage sprouting. Make sure the light in the room is indirect to prevent solanine production. Seed potatoes are sprouted potatoes that haven't been treated with a sprout inhibitor. Because many eating potatoes from the grocery store have been treated, you won\u2019t be able to grow a new plant from them. Solanine is a toxic chemical that potatoes produce when they're exposed to the sun. It appears as a layer of green under the skin."

          "description":"Larger seed potatoes with lots of sprouts can be cut into smaller portions to maximize plant growth. Make sure each piece has at least two sprouts. After cutting, let the potatoes rest for two days in a dry and well-ventilated location. This will give the skins time to heal, and prevent the potatoes from rotting in the ground."

To enhance the nutrients and acidity of your soil, mix it with equal parts mature compost or aged manure. Mixing the soil like this will also loosen it up, which is ideal for potatoes."

Potatoes in cages can dry out more quickly than those in the ground, so check the soil regularly for moisture."
