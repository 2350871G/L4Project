Place the tubers on a tray where they will receive direct sunlight and the temperature is somewhere between 60 and 70 \u00b0F (16 and 21 \u00b0C). Leave tubers on the sprouting tray 1 to 2 weeks. Sprouts should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) or longer after 2 weeks on the tray. Choose tubers that have at least 2 eyes and are no larger than a chicken egg."

Place the starts in a sunny windowsill or greenhouse.Keep them inside until after the last frost of the season. Oca is a frost sensitive plant. If you live in a temperate climate, starting oca inside will give them a head start and will increase the chances of large, healthy tubers. You will want to start oca at least 10 weeks before the last frost of the season. Oca can also be started from seed but the germination rate is lower. The seeds can also result in less uniform growth and can be hard to find."
