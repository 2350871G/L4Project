          "description":"You can find moss liners at most craft stores. Throw it over your table for an instant fairy transformation. It's the perfect base for little fairy hideouts and other decorations. If that's out of your budget, try lining the table with a green tablecloth or green paper."

Just use a doily big enough to act as a place mat for each setting, or use a series of doilies or a lace runner in the middle of the table."

          "headline":"Create a woodland wonderland.",
          "description":"Once you've created the base, add woodland touches here and there. Butterflies, ladybugs, flowers, toadstools, tiny fairy houses, and even gnomes make great decorations for a fairy party. Of course, don't forget to add some fairies!"

You can use simple cotton fabric from your local craft store. Next, add white felt dots with a glue gun. Cut the fabric into appropriate sizes, and pull it tight over the seat of the chair, stapling it underneath the seat of the chair. You can also use white fabric paint to add white dots, but you should do that before you put the fabric on your chair, as you could damage the fabric underneath if you don't."

You can even serve hot appetizers in them, such as little bowls of mac and cheese or spaghetti and meatballs. If your dish is messy, though, try serving them in foil liners and then placing them in paper liners. That will help make them sturdy and decorative."

You can use cookie cutters to cut out flower-shaped pieces of watermelon, then skewer them with green grapes or kiwi to create the leaves. You can also use edible flowers in your food. For instance, freeze edible flowers (like rose petals) in ice cubes to add whimsy to drinks."

Once melted, mix in a 12-ounce bag of chow mein noodles. Spray down a muffin pan, then drop the mixture into the pan in spoonfuls, shaping them into nests as you go. Let them set up in the fridge, then add in small, egg-shaped candies, such as jelly beans."

For something a little more sophisticated, try an orange smoothie. Mix a can of frozen orange juice (thawed out), 1 cup of water, 1 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and about 10 ice cubes in a blender, which makes 4-5 servings.

Twist the wire around itself, making a circle the size of the person's head. Glue some felt or fabric around the ends of the wire to keep it from scratching the person. Hot glue flowers on the front or use florist's tape to wrap them on. You can also use ivy instead of flowers for a green crown.
