The easiest way to make sure they have this is by inoculating the beans with nitrogen-fixing bacteria before planting. Be aware that inoculation is an optional step for growing pole beans \u2013 it\u2019s not absolutely necessary. To do it, soak the beans in warm water for five minutes.

          "description":"You can plant and grow pole beans in either hills or rows. The method you choose will depend largely on the layout of your garden, the type of support you created, and personal preference. Hills typically work better with poles and teepees, while rows are better suited for trellises. To plant in hills, use gloved hands or a spade to make small mounds of soil around the base of the teepees or poles. Make each mound about 6 inches (15 cm) around and at least 2 inches (5 cm) high. Space the hills 30 inches (76 cm) apart. Poke four 1-inch (2.5-cm) deep holes in each hill, and place one bean in each hole. Cover the beans loosely with soil. To plant in rows, use your hands or a spade to build up the soil into long rows that are 30 inches (76 cm) apart. Poke a 1-inch (2.5-cm) deep hole for each bean, and space the beans 4 inches (10 cm) apart. Place a bean in each hole and cover it loosely with soil."

Keep the soil evenly moist when you first plant the beans and when they start developing pods. Make sure they get about an inch (2.5 cm) of water per week. When the beans have sprouted but aren't yet developing pods, you can let the soil dry out between waterings."

When the seedlings develop their second set of leaves, add a 3-inch (8-cm) layer of mulch to the top of the garden bed. Mulch will also help prevent weeds from growing in the garden. This is important because pole beans have shallow roots, and don\u2019t do well when competing with weeds."

Beans should not be planted in the same place (or a place where any legume was planted) 2 years in a row, because they deplete the soil of certain nutrients. Diseases can also linger. Beans deplete certain nutrients but also add nitrogen to the soil as they grow. Following beans with a plant that thrives in nitrogen-rich soil, like a member of the cabbage family (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and others), is a good idea."

If you harvest the pods every couple days as they mature, the plants will continue producing pods for several days or even weeks. Pods are ready for harvest when they are long, crisp, and firm.
