          "description":"An initial cleaning with a rag dipped in fresh water will remove any dirt or streaks on your galvanized steel. Regular maintenance will reduce the amount of dirt and chemical buildup that forms on your steel over time and will make cleaning easier in the future."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Scrub your steel with a brush and a detergent solution.",
          "description":"Use a tablespoon (14.79 milliliters) of laundry detergent and mix it into a bucket of water. Make sure to do a thorough scrubbing over the surface of your steel and pay particular attention to problem areas where dirt or mud has built up. Use a nylon or plastic brush because other brushes can interact with the steel and alter its color. Do not use harsh cleaners. A cleaner with a pH of more than 12 to 13 can begin to dissolve the zinc in your galvanized steel. Washing steel in this way may make areas that you clean look uneven compared to the areas that you don't. Abrasive overwashing of your galvanized steel will reduce the steel's lifecycle and wear out the zinc coating. Scrub your galvanized steel sparingly."

        {
          "headline":"Use a car wash or truck wash to clean your steel.",
          "description":"Truck and car washes are made to reduce the potential for corrosion, and will typically also be well-suited to clean your galvanized steel. Remember to rinse your steel thoroughly with cold water after using the cleaner. Make sure to read the back of the car wash for directions and warnings. You can pick up car wash at an automotive store, department store, or online. Most contemporary cars use galvanized steel to prevent rusting."

          "description":"If you have a large area of galvanized steel to clean, like a roof or the siding on a building, using a pressure washer will save you time and effort. This is also a way to quickly rinse off any chemicals or cleaners you may have used to clean your steel. Make sure that your pressure washer is lower than 1450 psi, or it may remove the coating on your steel."

Mix the ammonia cleaner and the water into a bucket and use the solution to clean your galvanized steel. Wear gloves or the ammonia can cause irritation and chemical burns on exposed skin. You can also use CLR, lime juice, Rust Dissolver, 10G or white vinegar as an alternative to ammonia to remove wet storage stains from your galvanized steel."

Chemical passivating reduces the likelihood of wet storage spots or \"white rust\" from appearing on your steel. The process covers the steel with a thin layer of water-based chromate coating, which can further protect it from being affected by the environment. Spending the extra money passivating your steel may save you money in the long run because you won't have to pay for replacement steel."

Work your way around and remove the paint in large chunks, then concentrate on the smaller pieces next. Don't worry about getting it all, because you will be using a chemical process to eliminate the rest of the paint. If the paint is fresh and wet, skip this step and go to step two in this method.
