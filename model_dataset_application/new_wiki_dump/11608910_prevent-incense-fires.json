While small, flat stick incense holders, as well as glass holders, are quite popular, these lightweight, delicate options tend to be flimsy and are more prone to falling over. Metal, ceramic, and concrete holders that are large, heavy, and encase the incense are generally safer options."

In addition, keep your incense away from houseplants when it\u2019s burning, as these can also ignite if they come into contact with burning incense. While there are no hard and fast rules or recommendations about exactly how far away you should place your incense from potentially flammable liquids and materials, use your best judgement to place the holder far enough away so that it wouldn\u2019t ignite anything if it fell or blew over. Curtains, clothing, books, and newspapers, for example, are highly flammable and should be kept far away from burning incense."

These surfaces can withstand the heat from the holder and won\u2019t ignite if your incense holder happens to fall over. Surfaces like concrete and brick are also sturdy and heavy, making it less likely that they will fall over and spill the incense on wood flooring, rug, or carpet."
