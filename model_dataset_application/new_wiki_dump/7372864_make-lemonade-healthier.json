Raw and unprocessed honey may have antibacterial and antifungal properties, and it contains some minerals like iron and calcium. Boil half a cup of honey with a cup of water to make a syrup. Then, mix your syrup with lemon juice and four additional cups of cold water. Boil the honey/water mixture in a saucepan. Add the mixture to a pitcher. Add the lemon juice and remaining water. Refrigerate your mixture for two to three hours before drinking."

To make lemonade with coconut sugar, boil a cup of water and 3/4 cup of coconut sugar on low heat until the sugar dissolves. Place this mixture in a pitcher with three more cups of water and a cup of lemon juice. Mix everything together and then let the mixture cool until you have cold, refreshing lemon juice."

Strain out the rosemary and add three medium-sized lemons, cut into slices, into the water as well as a quarter cup of honey or maple syrup. Add a cup of raspberries. Then, chill the mixture in the refrigerator. The water should be flavored naturally by the fruit. If the mixture does not have enough of a lemonade taste, try adding some lemon juice to the water."

Blend everything together until you have a smooth, even consistency. For added sweetness, you can add one to two teaspoons of honey. However, this is not usually necessary as mangoes are a very sweet fruit. If the water, mangoes, and lemon juice are cold enough, it is not necessary to chill this mixture.
