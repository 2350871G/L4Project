This way, the new growth will make your plant look full and healthy. If you like, you can prune your plant after it finishes blooming, instead, but since the pruning will cause the plant to grow, it's best to do at the start of the growing season.

Older plumeria especially can get very woody, so a sharp tool is necessary to get a clean cut. Wear gardening gloves to protect your hands and improve your grip. For most plumeria plants, pruning shears are ideal. However, a pruning saw is a good option if you'll be cutting thicker plumeria branches, while a sharp knife would be ideal if you're pruning a younger, smaller plumeria plant. You can prevent the spread of harmful bacteria into the cuts by wiping the blade with rubbing alcohol before you start cutting as well as in between cuts."

Feel free to cut off any limbs or branches that are in your way or that you don\u2019t think look very good. The only way you can over-prune your plant is to cut it all the way to the ground."

In addition to protecting the original plumeria plant, cutting the limbs at an angle will give them more surface area to grow roots if you're planning on propagating them. If you do notice water collecting on the tips, treat them with a fungicide."

At 12\u201318 in (30\u201346 cm), your plant will be most likely to stay upright in the pot long enough to take root. If your limb tip has 2 or more growing points, you'll likely get a more compact plant that's more suited for a container, but you can also grow a new plumeria from a branch with one growing point. This will likely result in a taller plant that's more suited for outdoor growth."
