If you do not have a colander, you can rinse the beans in a bowl, draining the water from the bowl after you wash them. If you have nothing else that will work, you can hold the beans in your hands as you wash them. Keep a tight grasp so that they do not fall."

If using a bowl or colander, move the beans around with your hands to make sure that they are evenly washed. As you run water over the beans, remove visible dirt with your fingers. The water you use to clean the beans should be water that is safe to drink. If it is not safe, use distilled or bottled water instead."
