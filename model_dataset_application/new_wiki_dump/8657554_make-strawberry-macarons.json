You may find it easier to measure your ingredients by weight (digitally if possible), instead of with cups (as is standard in North America). For this recipe, you will need a measuring tool that can calculate grams. Macarons utilize egg whites, which can be one of the most difficult ingredients to master and use both safely and effectively. Separating egg whites is quite difficult. It is very important that none of the egg yolk is mixed in with the whites; otherwise, the meringue will not whip and the cookie shell will not properly form. Specific tools made to separate egg yolks and whites are often readily available. If it is not possible for you to obtain a specific separating utensil, then read How to separate an egg for instructions on how to properly procure the egg whites from your eggs."

Strawberry Macarons with White Chocolate Ganache Prepare the baking sheets (trays). Line one to two baking sheets with parchment or baking paper. This recipe makes 15 to 20 small macarons, so the amount of baking sheets needed will depend on their size. Place the icing (powdered) sugar into the flour sifter. Add the almond flour. Sift into the mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, prepare the egg whites. Whisk the egg whites and salt together until the mixture forms firm peaks. Add the caster (superfine) sugar and powdered pink food colouring. Whisk until the meringue mixture turns glossy and shiny. Add the almond flour to the meringue mixture. Use a spatula to stir the almond flour with the egg whites, lifting the mixture upward as you stir. Do not overwork the mixture; it should appear somewhat lighter but not too bright. Transfer the meringue and almond mixture to the baking sheet. Use a piping bag to pipe small, neat and evenly sized rounds onto the prepared baking sheet(s). Keep them as much the same size as possible and space them evenly. Set aside to stand for 1 hour at room temperature. Preheat the oven 10 minutes before baking. Preheat to 150\u00baF (300\u00baF) fan-forced, 170\u00baC (375\u00baF) conventional. Place the rested macarons into the preheated oven. Bake for 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely before handling. Pur\u00e9e the strawberries. See How to Pur\u00e9e Strawberries for information on doing this if you're unsure what to do. Add the white chocolate to a small saucepan with a heavy base. Melt over a low heat. A double boiler can be used if preferred. Pour the strawberry pur\u00e9e into the melted white chocolate mixture. Stir to combine. Remove from the heat and allow to cool down to room temperature before using. Spread the ganache on one half of a macaron. Gently press down another half onto the ganache to sandwich the two halves together. This forms the first macaron. Repeat with the remaining macaron halves until all have been created. Serve. The macarons can be served after making or stored chilled in an airtight container for two to three days. They are best consumed within 12 to 24 hours.",
