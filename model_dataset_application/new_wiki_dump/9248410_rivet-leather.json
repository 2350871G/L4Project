You should have at least 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) of rivet post above the surface of your leather. Push the rivet up from the bottom of the leather. Set the washer. Flip your leather over so you can see where the post sticks up through the leather. Set the washer over the post so that it\u2019s flat against the leather. Set the leather and rivet on an anvil. The anvil should be big enough to accommodate the piece of leather you\u2019re working on. You should be able to work on the rivet on a flat surface. Set up a copper rivet setter. A copper rivet setter is silver, and is almost shaped like a lighter. On one end, you\u2019ll see a concave circle, with a smaller, hollow circle next to it.
