          "description":"If you\u2019re not sure about the conditions in your garden, spend a sunny day watching the way the shadows fall throughout the day, then pick the sunniest spot for your dill. Dill is self-sowing, which means it produces seeds which will grow new plants, so choose a spot where you\u2019ll want to grow dill for the next several years. If you don\u2019t have a spot that gets 6-8 hours of sun each day, plant it in the sunniest spot you have available. Dill can tolerate some shade but it won\u2019t be as bushy."

          "headline":"Use pH strips to determine the acidity in your soil.",
          "description":"Place the pH strip into the soil, then compare it to a color chart to determine the pH level of your soil. Dill grows best in soil that is slightly acidic, so look for a pH that is about 5.8-6.5. Adjust the pH of the soil if you need to. If your soil is too acidic, you can raise the pH by adding powdered limestone. If your soil is too alkaline, you can add aluminum sulfate to your garden."

          "headline":"Add aged compost to the garden before you plant your dill.",
          "description":"Dill grows best in well-drained soil, and adding compost to your garden can help prevent standing water. If your soil isn\u2019t the best quality, though, don\u2019t worry; dill prefers somewhat poor, sandy conditions. You can make your own compost from the food scraps your family uses, or you can purchase compost from a co-op or garden shop."

          "headline":"Sow the seeds directly in the ground from April through May.",
          "description":"It\u2019s best to sow plant your dill after all danger of frost has passed. Plant the seeds so that they\u2019re about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) deep and 18 in (46 cm) apart, then rake the soil over the seeds. When you plant your dill may need to be adjusted based on your climate and the time of your last spring frost dates. Since dill does not transplant well, it\u2019s best to plant the seeds directly into the soil where you want them to grow. If you don't have a lot of space, or if you prefer to grow your dill indoors, sow your dill seeds directly into a container that's at least 12 in (30 cm). Place the container where the dill seeds will get 5-6 hours of direct sunlight each day."

          "headline":"Sow additional crops every 3-4 weeks for a continuous fresh harvest.",
          "description":"If you want to continue to enjoy fresh dill all through the summer and fall, you can continue planting new crops every few weeks until about 90 days before the first frost. If you don't expect to use a lot of dill at one time, only plant a few seeds at first, then a few more seeds a few weeks later, and so on. This will help ensure you don't end up with a huge crop all at once."

Check the soil each day by rubbing a little between your fingers, and add water when it starts to feel dry. If you over-water the dill plant, it may turn yellow."

Another 10-14 days after that, go through the rows of dill and thin out the seedlings so that you only have 1 plant every 12\u201318 in (30\u201346 cm). Select the strongest-looking seedlings to keep, and pull up any which seem weak or damaged. Thinning out your dill seedlings will ensure that the plants have plenty of room to grow.

This will help direct the plant's nutrients outwards, rather than upwards, which will encourage the dill to become bushier and to develop more leaves. Trimming the top of the plant can help keep the dill from becoming so top-heavy that it can't support its own weight."

If you see one of these on your dill plants, just remove it by hand. These bugs don\u2019t bite, but if you don\u2019t like the idea of touching insects with your bare hands, you may want to wear a pair of gardening gloves. Parsley caterpillars are black, yellow, and white, with a combination of spots and stripes, and they may appear to have yellow or orange horns.

Use twine to tie the stems to a stake if they don\u2019t seem sturdy or if you\u2019re expecting bad weather. If you don't have any garden stakes, you can tie the dill to a small twig or stick. You may need to add additional ties to the top of the plant as it grows. Due to lower levels of light, a container-grown dill plant tends to be taller and more spindly than one grown outdoors, so you may need to support it with a stake."
