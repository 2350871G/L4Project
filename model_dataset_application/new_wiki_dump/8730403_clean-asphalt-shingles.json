Wear long sleeves and pants to avoid getting the cleaning agent on your skin. Before venturing out onto the roof, let someone know you\u2019ll be doing so. That way, if you suffer an accident or injury on the roof, they\u2019ll be able to find you."

          "description":"Before using a cleaning agent to clean your asphalt shingles use a leaf blower or broom to sweep the shingles clean. Get rid of leaves, branches, and other debris that that may be on the shingles. This will make your efforts more effective and prevent you from dangerous situations like tripping on branches. When using the leaf blower to clear debris, blow from the ridge toward the edge of the roof. This will prevent branches and other debris from lodging beneath the shingles\u2019 edges. There\u2019s no need to wash the shingles before using the chemical cleaner."

          "description":"If you clean your roof on a day that is too hot or sunny, the cleaner will not have much time to work before it evaporates. Plus, it is easier to work outdoors on days that are less hot and humid. Therefore, clean asphalt shingles on cloudy days. Additionally, don\u2019t clean your asphalt tiles on days when the cleaning agent could freeze. In other words, only clean your asphalt shingles on days when the temperature will remain above 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees Celsius). Stay off the roof during very windy days."

For more information regarding how to pour your cleaning agent into the spraying device, consult manufacturer directions. Generally, you\u2019ll need to unscrew the tops of the spraying device and the cleaning agent, fill the spraying device, then screw the tops of the cleaning agent and the spraying device back on. Don\u2019t use a pressure washer to apply the cleaning agent. Doing so can damage your asphalt shingles. Use a low-pressure sprayer rated about 30 PSI."

After applying the cleaning agent, allow it to work its magic for about 20 minutes. The exact method by which you can spray the asphalt shingles varies slightly depending on the type of spraying device you\u2019ve decided to use. Consult manufacturer directions for more information. The amount of cleaning agent you\u2019ll need to use depends on the number and size of the asphalt shingles you wish to clean. Generally, the more shingles you want to clean, the more cleaning agent you\u2019ll need. You can identify asphalt shingles that need to be cleaned by looking for black, green, or blue stains. This indicates the presence of algae or moss."

If you\u2019re having a hard time getting your asphalt shingles clean, let the roof dry, then spray it with the cleaning agent and rinse it with water again."
