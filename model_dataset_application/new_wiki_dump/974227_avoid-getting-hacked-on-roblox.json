However some websites, often ask for your login information; this is an obvious sign that it is a scam. You may see comments of people that it works, but don't believe them. They're either fake comments that the creator put up, or they're people who say that just to make other people believe that it's real. They might even get paid to say stuff like that. Or just scammers that think it is funny to scam others. For some websites you even have to pay just to get hacked!"
