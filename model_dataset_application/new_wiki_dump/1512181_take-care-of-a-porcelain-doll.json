However, when a doll is a collectible or a decoration you should always wear white cotton gloves when you handle it. The oils on your skin can stain the doll's porcelain and clothing, as well as attract dust."

You can purchase doll display cases online that work well for this. However, if you smoke, store your doll in an airtight container to prevent stains. The doll should always be out of direct sunlight and be in room temperature, not extreme temperatures.

This will help keep your doll clean and might mean you never have to give it a deep cleaning. If there is stubborn dust you can put your doll in a nylon sock and carefully vacuum the doll over the stocking or use an air compressor on the lowest setting. If you don't use the stocking your doll's hair can get frizzy, tangled, and ruined. If you don't have a stocking you can cover your doll's hair with your hands."

Rub the cloth or sponge on the doll. Make sure to wipe, not to scrub, otherwise the paint (especially the makeup on the face), might come off. You can clean crevices and hard to reach places (such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears) with a Q-tip or toothbrush. Make sure to be very gentle, especially around the eyelashes."

If that does not get the stain off, you can try a little bit of baking soda and water. Always test on a hidden part of the doll first because using soap or baking soda can cause the paint to possibly come off."
