To use an electric hygrometer, place it 1 metre (3.3 ft) off the ground for at least 3 minutes and read the humidity output. If humidity levels are above 60%, you should use a dehumidifier. Some dehumidifiers will have a hygrometer built-in. You can purchase an electric hygrometer online or at certain department stores. A moderately-damp room will have 45%-50% humidity."

A dehumidifier that has 10 US pints (4.7 l; 8.3 imp pt) of removal capacity is able to dehumidify a moderately damp 500 square feet (46 m) room. From there, add 4 US pints (1.9 l; 3.3 imp pt) of capacity for every additional 500 square feet (46 m) of space. For example, if your space is a moderately damp 1,500 square feet (140 m) room, you'd want to get a dehumidifier with a pint removal capacity of at least 18 US pints (8.5 l; 15 imp pt). The pint removal capacity represents the amount of water that a dehumidifier is able to gather in a 24-hour period. If your ceiling is unusually high, you may want a higher capacity machine."
