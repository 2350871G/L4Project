Dover sole skin is slightly thick and rubbery, so it will take a small amount of pressure to make the cut. Don\u2019t cut entirely through the tail since this will make it more difficult to peel the skin off."

Place the heel of your non-dominant hand on the tail and use your dominant hand to pull the skin towards the head. As you approach the head of the fish, slow down so you don\u2019t damage it.

Take the fish out of the flour and shake off the excess so it\u2019s barely coated. Slap the sole once or twice to remove any extra flour that may not fall off on its own.

The oil prevents the butter from burning and the addition of butter will help add more flavor to your Dover sole. You can use salted butter if you\u2019d like, but it may affect the overall saltiness of your fish. Sprinkle less salt in the beginning if you use unsalted butter."

The fish should be flaky and have a golden-brown color once it\u2019s finished. Remove the fish from heat once it\u2019s finished cooking.
