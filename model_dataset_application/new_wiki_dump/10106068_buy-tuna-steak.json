Unlike its overfished cousins the Bluefin and Albacore, the Skipjack is a relatively small tuna that is known as one of the more ecologically sustainable tuna species. Skipjack tuna has a bold flavor, so its steak suits robust sauces and garnishes."

If you are lucky, your town may have a specialized fishmonger store or seafood market that will sell fresh tuna. If possible, locate a store that has a reputable fish counter. Stores with an in-house fish counter tend to have a higher turnover of seafood, which means you will be able to purchase fresher tuna. Since tuna (especially high-quality tuna) can be expensive, visit your local store\u2019s website to look at their tuna price range. If the tuna is too expensive, you could consider alternatives such as purchasing a frozen tuna steak."

The best type of seafood seller will display tuna as a whole loin, and you can ask the butcher to cut steaks from the loin. If your store displays steaks that are already sliced, look for the ones that are moist, about one-inch thick, shiny, and almost translucent. Tuna will taste best (and be less expensive) when they are in season, which is from May through to early September."

Fresh tuna will look moist but not wet, and it will have a fresh sea-air smell rather than a strong fishy odor. Tuna that looks dull, dry, flaky or is brown on the edges will most likely not be fresh. All tuna steaks have a middle strip of darker meat running through them that should look moist, rather than flaky or dry. This meat has a strong flavor that some people may not like, but it is edible and nutritious."

          "description":"Tuna dries out quickly, so place your steak on a covered tray or in a lidded container and store it in the bottom shelf of your refrigerator. Your tuna should be stored at a temperature of 40 Fahrenheit or below and should be eaten within 2 days. Alternatively, you can freeze the steak until you are ready to cook it. Due to the possible presence of parasites, all tuna should be cooked prior to eating. If you are going to eat raw tuna, freeze it first, as freezing will kill the parasites. To be safe, freeze tuna for at least 15 hours at -35 Fahrenheit."
