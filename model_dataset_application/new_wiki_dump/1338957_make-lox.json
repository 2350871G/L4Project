          "description":"To prepare homemade lox, you\u2019ll need 1 \u00bd to 2 pounds (680 to 907 g) of boneless salmon fillet with the skin on. Run some cold water in the sink and rinse the fillet well. Next, examine the fillet to make sure that all of the bones have been removed. You can purchase either \"belly lox\" or regular \"lox\" fillets. Both are salmon, but belly lox comes from the stomach region of the fish. The graining of fat in the stomach region makes belly lox the better option to use when you make lox because it is more widely spaced. This results in a final product that is more desirable and less salty. If there are any pin bones left in the salmon fillet, use a small pair of tweezers or pliers to pull them out in the same direction that they\u2019re facing. Pin bones are more likely to occur in wild salmon than farmed salmon."
