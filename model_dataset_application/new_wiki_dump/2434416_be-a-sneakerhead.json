          "description":"Buying shoes is an expensive hobby. Before you jump right in, you should be certain that you can afford to start amassing a footwear collection. Develop a budget that will allow you to set aside a certain amount of money every month or couple of months to spend on new shoes. If need be, find a second job and use the extra income to support your hobby. Name brand sneakers often run for as much as a few hundred dollars per pair. If you\u2019re serious about the lifestyle, consider getting a job at a sneaker store. Not only will you be surrounded by the thing you love most, you\u2019ll also be earning extra money and be eligible for employee discounts."

          "description":"Snatch up as many eye-catching pairs of sneakers as you can. Be on the lookout constantly for new brands, styles and colorways. Buy the latest models when they premier to stay current and show people that you have style. Buying and showing off new shoes is what being a sneakerhead is all about, so the more pairs you buy, the more impressive your stockpile will be. Shopping malls usually have at least one or two stores that carry the latest fashions in athletic and streetwear. Look for deals online through websites like Zappos and 6pm, where you can buy shoes for discounted rates and save on shipping."

          "description":"Every sneakerhead's collection is going to contain a few staples. Browse thrift shops and other discount clothing retailers to track down timeless models like Jordans, Reebok Classics or Air Force 1s for unbeatable prices. Since these vintage sneakers are older, they're more likely to turn up in places that most sneakerheads wouldn't think to go looking. See if your area has any consignment stores that deal specifically with footwear. The sneakers you find in these places may not be brand new, but after a thorough restoration job no one will be likely to tell the difference."

          "headline":"Decide on a favorite brand or style.",
          "description":"After they\u2019ve been collecting for a while, most sneakerheads develop a preference for a particular brand or type of shoe. Certain designers and models are fashionable among shoe collectors, but there are no \u201cbest\u201d brands. If you like it and it looks good on you, buy it. No two sneakerheads\u2019 closets are identical. Once you start to refine your tastes, your collection will start to take on its own unique personality. Your collection might be made up mostly of hi-top basketball shoes, for instance, or you might gravitate toward lower profile designs like skate shoes. There is a lot of territorial competition between fans of Nike, Adidas, Reebok, etc., but it\u2019s all in good fun. Any model could have a potential place in your collection.

Tannya Bernadette\t\t\tFounder, The Closet Edit\t\t\t\tYou'll have plenty of options when you're looking for sneakers. Master stylist Tannya Bernadette says: \"There are so many cool sneakers to choose from. You can wear slip-on sneakers, or you can find part-sneakers, part slip-on loafers that are really comfortable. Some sneakers have big bows, or plaid. You can even wear sneakers with rose gold or silver to dress up your outfit.\""

Be sure to take your new kicks out for a spin every so often to give them a little play. Match up the day\u2019s outfit with a killer pair of sneakers and let the people around you see what style is all about. You might never wear the same pair two days in a row!

By taking good care of your sneakers and keeping them clean, you can ensure that they stay fresh and vibrant for as long as possible.

Select a different pair every couple of days to minimize stress, foot contact and exposure to the elements. When you\u2019re not wearing a pair, give it a gentle wipe down and store it somewhere cool and dry. Store your sneakers in their original boxes, or stash them somewhere that\u2019s climate-controlled and away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Too much sunlight can cause colors to fade, while especially hot or cold temperatures can degrade the materials that the shoes are made from. Choose your footwear carefully for a given day. It might not be a good idea to wear a pair of leather or suede sneakers if the forecast is calling for rain, and black hi-tops will be less comfortable on hotter days than low cut, breathable shoes of a lighter shade."

Consider buying two pairs of your favorite shoes\u2014one to wear around and another to put on display.

If you\u2019re going to own them, you might as well put them on display proudly.
