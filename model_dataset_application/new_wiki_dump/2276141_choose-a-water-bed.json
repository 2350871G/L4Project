          "description":"Probably the most essential aspect of choosing the best water bed for your needs is finding one with the right amount of movement. The wave effect is what sets the water bed apart from a traditional mattress. However, too much movement can be uncomfortable or keep you up at night. The waveless rating indicates how quickly the mattress returns to stability after movement. Most water beds come with a waveless rating between 100 and 85%. 100% waveless mattresses return to stability almost immediately after movement. These typically utilize pockets of air, water, and fiber layers within the mattress to achieve maximum stability. 100-95% waveless mattresses move for a few seconds before calming. These are the most common type of water bed mattress. They make entering and exiting the bed comfortable, and feel very much like a non-water mattress. 90-85% waveless mattresses can move for several seconds each time you shift positions. If you are looking for a water bed that offers a rocking, cradling movement to help you sleep, this range may be ideal. 85% or less waveless mattress are what you would call full-motion water beds. Typically, these are hard sided water beds with one, large water bladder inside them. This is what most people think of when they think of water beds. However, for most people, these mattresses will not likely offer adequate support."

Hard sided water beds are the traditional type where a water mattress is held in shape by a specially crafted bed frame. Soft sided water beds are more like traditional mattresses. A foundation and edges are crafted from soft foam, and the water mattress fits into these softer materials. Hard sided mattresses offer greater motion, but are often large. You\u2019ll need to adjust the rest of your furnishing to match the specially crafted bed frame, and you will also need special bedding to fit the mattress.

Factoring in Your Partner when Picking a Water bed Bring your partner along to try out beds. If you are sharing your bed prior to purchasing a water mattress, make sure to include your bed partner in the purchase process. You both need to be comfortable with the amount of support, movement, and temperature associated with the water bed. Try out mattresses together, and choose one that best meets both of your needs.

These mattresses are typically thinner than other water beds, and while they have higher waveless ratings, they do not offer the same level of support available from traditional water beds with fiber layers.
