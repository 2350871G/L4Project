Be warned that salt will also kill other vegetation in the area, so make sure to use it only in spots that are weed prone. Amine salt is a good solution for killing weeds and can be combined with water in a spray bottle for easier application. Borax is another, more caustic solution to killing weeds in small cracks. Make sure to use gloves when handling it."

          "description":"Weeds like to grow in open areas that are abundant in nutrients and minerals. You can prevent them by maintaining a thick and healthy lawn that has grass and other lawn plants to compete with weeds that may want to grow in the area. Keeping your lawn fertilized will promote healthy growth for all plants on your lawn or garden bed. Reseeding lawns in the fall will promote healthy grass growth next season because many weeds die late in the fall, and the grass seeds will have less to compete with."

          "description":"Smothering weed seeds with mulch will hinder their germination and could prevent them from growing all together. Keep your garden or lawn area well mulched in order to prevent weed growth. Spread the mulch 2 to 4 inches deep to retain moisture and to stop weed growth. Organic mulches like hardwood mulch, shredded bark, pine needles and straw degrade over a couple of months and can provide additional nutrition to your soil. Another mulching technique is to turn the soil, water it, allow weeds to spout, then stake down a heavy black tarpaulin over the area. The black color of the tarp causes the ground beneath to heat up in the sun and kills the weeds. After a couple of weeks the ground will be sterilized."

You can also opt to sever the roots of the weeds with a knife by stabbing the dirt under the weed where the roots are. Weeds are easier to pull when the soil is moist. A single dandelion can create 15,000 seeds in a single year, which may lead to additional weeds in your garden. Pull or sever the weeds when they\u2019re young before they can create more seeds."
