To remove the panel, use a screwdriver and loosen the screws attaching the panel to the unit. Turn the screws to the left (counter-clockwise) to loosen them. Removing the panel will help you find the source of the leak, which may be coming from underneath the dishwasher."

Check for cracks in the pump or housing, and inspect the seal or gasket for damage. When there's a problem with the pump or pump components, water will leak from below the dishwasher."

Determining the source of the water can help you narrow down the possible causes. Run the dishwasher through a normal cycle and watch closely to see where the water is coming from. Water leaking around or under the door could indicate a problem with the gasket, spray arm, or float. Water leaking from under the unit could indicate a problem with the pump, hoses, or water inlet."

The gasket will either be on the door itself (around the sides and top), or on the tub opening. Check this for breaks, cracks, brittleness, or other signs of damage. Water leaking from the sides of the dishwasher doors usually means there's a problem with the gasket. The tub is the interior basin of the dishwasher unit."

When the dishwasher is in mid-cycle and full, turn it off, open the door, and check the water level. The water shouldn\u2019t be any higher than the heating element in the bottom of the tub. If the water is higher than the heating element, there may be a problem with the float or float switch. When the float is the problem, water will often leak from the bottom front of the dishwasher."

It may be a rubber hose, a braided hose, or a copper pipe. When the dishwasher is filling up, check the valve and the connections for leaks, which could indicate a crack or tear. Leaks or tears in the water inlet valve will come from below the dishwasher."
