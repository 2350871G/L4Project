Consider serving light cheeses like fresh mozzarella and goat cheese. You might also consider a light cheese that pairs well with the main meal that you are serving. For example, goat cheese is a great compliment to Mediterranean or Middle Eastern dishes."

Serve soft and hard cheeses with distinctly varied flavors. Mix in cheeses from different animals and from multiple geographic locations. Ideally, you will want to serve three to five cheeses. More than that can get a little overwhelming and crowd your serving area. For example, you may want to offer your guests a plate that includes Comte, camembert, Manchego, and gorgonzola."

Focus on cheese from a certain country or a specific cheese-producing region. For example, you might decide that you want to serve Italian cheeses or choose serve cheeses exclusive to the Loire Valley of France. You can also do the opposite of this and serve a variety of cheese from around the world."
