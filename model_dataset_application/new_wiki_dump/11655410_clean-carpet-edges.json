          "description":"Pushing your stand-up vacuum cleaner back and forth over your carpet isn\u2019t enough to keep your edges clean. To get into the cracks along your skirting boards, use the crevice attachment that came with your vacuum cleaner. Press the tip of the attachment down into the carpet to suck up any dust, dirt, and debris. For instance, you might vacuum the edges once a week with your crevice attachment. The crevice attachment looks like a thin rectangular slit, which might be cut at an angle.Variation: If your vacuum cleaner didn\u2019t come with a crevice attachment, use a handheld vacuum to clean your carpet edges. If you don't have either a crevice attachment or a handheld vacuum, try detaching the hose from your vacuum. Hold the open end of the hose over your carpet edges and drag it along the skirting board."

Slowly pull the crevice attachment along the skirting board, then reverse directions. Make 2 or 3 passes in each direction to get the carpet as clean as possible.

However, it\u2019s harder to clean your carpet edges when they have a build-up of dirt and dust. Stick to your weekly vacuuming schedule so your carpet edges stay clean.

Spray a carpet cleaner onto the stain, then dab the area with a clean, white cloth until the stain comes up. Follow all of the directions on your carpet cleaner to maximize your results. For a stubborn stain, apply more cleaner as needed to remove the stain. Use a white cloth because dyes from paper towels or rags can bleed into the carpet.Variation: If you prefer a natural cleaner, make a 1 part vinegar and 1 part water solution. Spray or blot the stain with the vinegar-water solution, then dab it with a clean white rag until the stain is gone."
