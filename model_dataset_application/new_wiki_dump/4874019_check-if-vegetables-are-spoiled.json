          "description":"Green vegetables will wilt after a couple days, especially if they're unpackaged. That is okay and doesn\u2019t mean they are spoiled. Greens that are close to spoiling will start turning a yellowish color, become slimy, and have a foul odor. You can revitalize leafy greens by soaking their stems in warm water for 10 to 15 minutes. This does not always work, however, so if your leafy greens still look droopy after soaking, go ahead and toss them."

It will turn dark green or black, and it will become mushy or slimy. If this happens, you can still eat the asparagus if you cut off the tips and just cook the stems. If the whole asparagus has turned dark green or black, throw it out and don\u2019t eat it."

Carrots that are bad will be mushy and slimy. If they are slightly limp or still hard, you can still eat them. Carrots will get white dots on them when they are dehydrated.
