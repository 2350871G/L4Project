Look for hoses that are detached on one end and hoses that are shredded or clearly cracked. If you spot a problem like this than that is likely the cause of your engine problems. The number of hoses your engine has and their locations vary widely depending on your specific engine. Use a flashlight while you are looking at your engine so that you can see as many areas as possible. Small cracks in a hose can cause a vacuum leak. A visual inspection may not be able to find this type of small leak."

          "description":"Vacuum leaks often occur at the point where a hose attaches to a solid piece of the engine. Make sure the clamps that hold the hoses onto the engine are tight. You can do this by gently moving the hose and the clamp. The clamp should not move when you pull on the hose or on it. Be sure that your engine is off and that it is cool to the touch when you do this. If a hose clamp moves, you should try to tighten it. Most hose clamps have a screw on them that tightens the clamp when you turn it. Even if you don't find a loose or damaged hose, you could still have a vacuum leak. You will just have to look further for the source of the leak."

Once the car is warmed up, you can get an accurate reading on the guage. A typical care has 17 to 20 inches (43.2 to 50.8 cm) of vacuum. If your hose is reading under that, it may have a leak."

You simply let the car idle and then spray a very small amount of the cleaner or fluid on the area where you suspect a leak. If there is a leak, the engine will run quicker for just a moment. This is because the fluid or cleaner that was sucked in has added to the fuel burning in the engine. This is a relatively dangerous method to use for finding a vacuum leak. You are spraying a combustible material into your engine while it is running. In most cases, it will work fine and will not burn outside the engine. However, if there is a stray spark or overheated area, you could cause a fire on the engine or an explosion."
