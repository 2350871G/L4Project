  "text":" Preparing the Vodka Mixture Sterilize a glass jar by running it through the dishwasher or by filling it with boiling water before you add the vodka and lemon peels.  Peel the zest from a lemon by inserting the blade of a paring knife between the zest and the pith. Try to remove the yellow peel without removing the bitter white pith beneath the peel. Place the peels inside a 1 gallon (3.8 L) airtight glass jar with a lid, such as a pickle jar. Save the peeled lemons for another use. Repeat the steps until you have peeled approximately 15 lemons.  Pour 1 bottle of vodka over the lemon peels and then seal the jar.  Place the jar in a cool, dry place, such as a closet, and allow the mixture to steep for approximately 2 to 3 weeks.  Storing and Serving the Finished Product Retrieve your jar of lemon vodka from its storage location and open it.  Place a clean tea towel, a piece of cheesecloth or a sieve over the opening of the jar.  Pour the vodka into sterile bottles or jars, allowing the cheesecloth or towel to strain out the lemon zest.  Discard the lemon peels in your compost pile or garbage can.  Seal your bottles or jars of lemon vodka and place them in your freezer until you are ready to either serve them or to give them as gifts. ",
