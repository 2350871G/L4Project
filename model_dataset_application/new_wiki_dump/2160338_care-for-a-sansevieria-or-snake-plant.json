Choose a pot that has good drainage, like a terra cotta pot or a pot made with another porous material so your snake plant isn\u2019t at risk of rotting. Porous materials include terra cotta, clay, timber, paper pulp, and other natural materials that allow moisture to move through them.Tip: If you plan to keep your snake plant outside, choose a darker color pot to attract more heat, especially if you live in an area that freezes."

To allow for good drainage and a healthy root system, choose a free-draining soil mix or even a soilless potting mixture. Place your sansevieria into the potting mixture and cover it with enough to hold it secure in the pot. Many potting mixes that you can purchase from gardening stores are designed to help control moisture and improve drainage. Check the packaging for information on the potting mix.
