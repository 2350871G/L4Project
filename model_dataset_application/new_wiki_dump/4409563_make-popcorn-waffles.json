  "text":" Popping the Popcorn Drizzle the oil over a 3-quart deep saucepan. Set the temperature on the stovetop to medium-high heat. Allow the oil to heat up. If coconut oil is being used, wait for the solid oil to fully melt. Place 3-4 popcorn kernels in the oil. Let the kernels heat up until they pop. Pour the rest of the kernels in and remove from heat. Add in the rest of the popcorn kernels in an even layer. Immediately cover the saucepan and remove it from the stovetop for 30 seconds. The reason why this is done is to help bring the oil at a correct temperature. When the kernels are placed back onto the heat, they can all pop at the same time. Bring the saucepan back on the heat. The kernels will begin popping and turning into popcorn. Allow it to pop until the popping sounds start to slow down. Shake the pan back and forth to avoid the popcorn from burning. You may want to leave the lid on the pan a little ajar to help steam release from the popcorn. This keeps the popcorn being deliciously crispy and dry for the waffles. Pour the popcorn in a large bowl. Drizzle the butter over, if desired, and add a desired amount of salt. Set aside. Making the Waffles and Serving Preheat the waffle iron and spread melted butter over it.  Whisk the dry ingredients. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder. Mix until well-combined. Beat the wet ingredients. In a separate medium-sized bowl, whisk the butter, vanilla, eggs, and milk. Beat until properly combined. Fold in the wet ingredients mixture with the dry. Beat with a whisk until properly mixed. There will be some lumps. Cook the waffles. Scoop the waffle batter in the waffle iron. Cook according to your waffle iron's instructions, cooking until each side of the waffle is golden brown. Repeat until there is no more waffle batter.  Serve. Place a few waffles on a serving plate.
