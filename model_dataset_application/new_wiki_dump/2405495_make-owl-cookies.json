You can even cut the top off a metal can and clean it thoroughly. Once you\u2019ve picked the tool of your choice, make two owls at once as follows:Press one oval or circle onto the rolled-out dough. Press a second oval or circle overlapping the first by a small amount. If using an oval or egg-shaped cutter, overlap both smaller ends. Remove the small piece of dough caused by the overlap. You now have two owls, each with two pointy ears."
