      "description":"Once the solvent has dissolved the remaining resin, it will be likely to spread and go deeper into the nylon fibers. The following solvents may remove a significant amount of the tree sap, and if you are careful not to use too much, it shouldn't damage the nylon, or the down inside it. Grease cutting dish detergent like Dawn. Dab a drop on, full strength, then dab off with a paper towel. Gojo or a similar mechanic's hand cleaner. These products use lanolin, orange oil, and mild degreasers, which should break down the sap. Denatured alcohol. This will break down the sap, but you will have to allow it to soak, keeping just the area that is affected damp, but not wet."
