Prickly pear fruit is a red, egg-shaped fruit that grows off the top of the prickly pear plant. To remove the seeds from a fruit:\nPut on gloves to protect your hands from the thorns. Slice the ends off the fruit. Stand the fruit up on one end. Make a thin, vertical slice down one side of the skin, and carefully stick a finger underneath. Peel away the skin by unwrapping the fruit like an orange. Use your fingers to break apart the flesh to find the seeds, which are studded throughout the fruit."

Fill the pot with soil that contains about half soil and half sand, rough pumice, or loam. These soils drain better than ones with a high clay content, and are more similar to the natural desert soils a cactus prefers. You can also purchase a pre-mixed cactus or succulent potting mix. If you don\u2019t have any garden pots, you can use a plastic cup. Poke several holes in the bottom to allow water to drain out. To grow multiple prickly pears, prepare several garden pots in this way."

As the seeds grow, keep the soil moist until they germinate. Water the soil when it starts to become dry to the touch. Prickly pears grown from seeds tend to take longer to grow than propagated plants, and the resulting cacti could take three to four years to produce flowers and fruit. However, growing plants from seeds is important for ensuring genetic diversity."

To avoid having to move the prickly pear constantly, you can position the plant so the broad sides of the pad are facing east and west, so the thinner sides of the pad are facing the sun when it\u2019s at its hottest. This will protect it from sunburn so that you don\u2019t have to move it out of the sun every afternoon. Once the cutting has established roots it will be ready for full sun exposure."
