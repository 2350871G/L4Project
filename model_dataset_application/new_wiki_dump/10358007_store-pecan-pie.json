          "description":"If you have cooked a pecan pie yourself, it\u2019s important to let it cool before covering it and storing it. Make sure it is room temperature by touching the underside of the pan. If there is any heat given off, it needs to cool longer. In most cases, it will take several hours for a freshly baked pie to cool to room temperature. If you have baked the pie late in the day, you will likely need to let it cool at room temperature overnight before refrigerating it. Having your pie be completely cool will help ensure that it is set when you store it. A set pie will hold up better to the jostling and movement you will put it through while storing it."

          "description":"Plastic wrap will keep air off the pie, which will help extend its freshness. In order to get a tight wrap, make sure that the surface is completely covered and wrap the plastic wrap around the whole pan. If you are storing a store-bought pie that came in a container, determine if the package is air tight. If there is a lot of space between the pie and the packaging, consider adding a layer of plastic wrap to the surface of the pie inside the package. If the pie is still warm when you wrap it, the heat will steam the crust, making it weaker and potentially soggy."

          "description":"A pecan pie that will be used the same day as it was baked, or even the next day, can safely be left at room temperature. Just keep it covered and place in an out of the way place on your counter. Store bought pies are likely to contain preservatives, so consult the packaging to determine if it can be kept at room temperature or if it needs to be refrigerated. The amount of sugar in a pecan pie will make it very difficult for it to spoil quickly. However, if you are nervous about spoilage, err on the side of caution and choose to refrigerate the pie."

Try to keep it in an area of the fridge with a steady temperature, as this will help keep it fresh longer. By putting the pie in the fridge you do risk losing the crispness of the crust and the pecans on top. However, if you keep it tightly covered and at a steady temperature, this risk is minimized."

Simply take the pie out of the fridge and let it come to room temperature or heat it up before serving. If you want to reheat the pie, try putting it in a 275 \u00b0F (135 \u00b0C) oven for 15 minutes before serving it. You can usually tell that a pie has gone bad by inspecting the crust. If it looks soggy or moldy, the pie has gone bad and you need to dispose of it."

Try to use the pie within 2 months, as after that it may develop freezer burn. To reheat a frozen pie, let it thaw overnight in the refrigerator. Then warm it in a 275 \u00b0F (135 \u00b0C) oven for 15 to 20 minutes. The pie will do better if it is kept at a constant temperature in the freezer. If you have a deep freeze, keep it in that.
