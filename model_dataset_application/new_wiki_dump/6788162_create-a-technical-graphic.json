For example, you can use graphics to show trends and relationships, explain processes, or show readers how something looks.

          "description":"Your graph will be much more effective if you think about what you want your audience to learn from the graphic. For example, let's say you want to compare the profits of three different companies over a set amount of time, where one company has a large volume of sales compared to the other two, which have a lower, and also similar amount of sales A line chart works best to show trends in continuous data. In other words, a line chart would effectively show the trend of increasing sales of the company with large profits, because our time variable is at a constant, fixed increase, and we can accurately determine the amount of increase from month to month. If you wanted to categorize the companies, and compare elements of the categories, a bar graph would work best, but is less effective  in showing the difference in sales between the two companies with similar volumes of profit than a line chart. Using another example in the graphic above, the line  shows a trend in batting average effectively, whereas the bars of the graphic don't really illustrate an up and down trend in innings played clearly. Rather, the bars do a better job in categorizing two different factors in innings played. In addition, if you wanted to find and use data or facts, you would use a table, whereas if you wanted to see the relative size comparison of different variables, you would use a pie chart."
