You should get 12 circles once you've cut both of the puff pastry sheets. If you'd like to make smaller cases, use a 2 \u20444 inches (5.7 cm) round cutter."

  "text":" Puff Pastry Cases Preheat the oven to 425 \u00b0F (218 \u00b0C) and unroll the puff pastry. Take the thawed puff pastry out of the package and unroll 2 sheets. Lay both sheets flat on your work surface so you can cut the cases out. If you prefer, make your own puff pastry instead of buying it. Cut at least 6 circles out of each pastry sheet.

Avoid storing leftover vol-au-vent since the pastry will become soggy as the cream cheese mixture sits in it. Mushroom and Thyme Filling Mince the wild mushrooms and smash the garlic clove. Get out 1 cup (75 g) of wild mixed mushrooms and finely chop them so they're uniform in size. Peel 1 garlic clove and push down on it until it's smashed. You can use the flat blade of a chef's knife or the bottom of a glass to smash the garlic clove. Saut\u00e9 the mushrooms, garlic, and time for 4 minutes.

Serve the vol-au-vent immediately. Since the puff pastry will become soggy as it sits, don't store leftover vol-au-vent. Creamy Chicken and Leek Filling Chop the bacon and heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cut 6 slices of bacon into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) pieces and set a skillet on the stove. Turn the burner to medium-high and let the skillet heat for a few minutes. Fry the bacon for 7 to 10 minutes and drain it. Add the bacon to the skillet and cook it until the bacon becomes crispy and fully cooked. Stir frequently to prevent the bacon from sticking.

The amount of time it takes to fry the bacon will vary depending on what type of bacon you're using, how fatty it is, how thick it is, and the type of skillet you're using. Saut\u00e9 the leeks and pepper for 5 to 7 minutes. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the bacon grease in the skillet and keep the burner turned to medium-high. Add 2 sliced leeks and 1 diced yellow bell pepper. Stir and cook the vegetables until they soften.Did You Know? Although you can use orange or red bell peppers, the yellow bell peppers will have the mildest flavor. For a sweeter flavor, use red bell peppers.
