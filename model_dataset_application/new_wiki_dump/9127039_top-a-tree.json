Place your left hand on the handlebar and your right hand on the starter-rope handle. Pull the starter rope gently until you feel resistance. Then pull the rope toward you several times until the engine starts. (Consult the manufacturer's instructions for advice on using the choke mechanism.) Once the engine is running, briefly pull the throttle trigger to rev the engine (to make sure it will successfully accelerate). Then carefully lift up the chainsaw. Make sure you have secure footing when starting a chainsaw. If you need to use something like a ladder to top a tree, it's not recommended you do so alone unless you have extensive experience operating a chainsaw. Stick to topping shorter trees where the branches can be reached when standing on the ground."

Place the chainsaw against the side of the tree toward which you want the top to fall. Make a horizontal cut into the tree. Stop cutting when you're about 1/4 to 1/3 of the way through the tree's diameter. (In other words, stop cutting well before the chain reaches the center of the trunk.)"
