          "description":"Old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs waste up to 90% of their energy as heat. New types of light bulbs, such as compact fluorescent (CFL) and LED bulbs, can dramatically slash your house\u2019s energy consumption for light. In most cases, you don\u2019t have to do a thing to your existing light fixtures. Just buy different bulbs and swap them out! CFLs are like the fluorescent bulbs in supermarkets, but they\u2019re shaped in a small coil and are about the same shape and size as incandescent bulbs. They last about ten times as long as an incandescent bulb. They\u2019re usually a little bit more expensive, but they pay for themselves within a year. CFLs are a good choice for most home lighting situations. However, they usually cannot be dimmed, and they waste a lot of their energy when used in recessed or \u201ccan\u201d lights. Because CFLs contain a small (but rarely dangerous) amount of mercury, they must be disposed of carefully. The Environmental Protection Agency has full instructions on their website. LEDs last up to 35 times longer than an incandescent bulb, and between 2-4 times longer than CFLs. LEDs are cool to the touch, so they don\u2019t use much energy at all. However, they are usually still more expensive than either incandescent or CFL bulbs. LEDs are a good choice for most home lighting situations. Unlike incandescent and CFL bulbs, LEDs emit \u201cdirectional\u201d light, meaning the light is focused in a specific direction (like a spotlight). They are a great choice for recessed lighting. Only Energy Star-certified LED bulbs are specifically designed to replicate the omnidirectional light of a traditional light bulb. Look for the Energy Star label to make sure that the LED bulbs you buy give you the look you want. Even better, open curtains and windows during daylight hours to use natural light. This can really cut power costs and also save loads of energy."

Coffee grounds, fruit and vegetable peels, eggshells, even napkins and paper towels can be recycled to produce compost, which is great for gardens. Keeping food scraps out of landfills is good for the environment! It keeps them from building up methane gas (which is a major part of global warming) as they decompose in plastic trash bags, and it helps reduce the amount of waste in landfills. Even if you live in an urban area, you can keep a compost bin on a balcony or porch. Many online retailers sell ready-to-go compost kits.

She's the author of 101 Ways to Go Zero Waste and spokesperson for plastic-free living for National Geographic. Kathryn Kellogg\t\t\tAuthor, 101 Ways to Go Zero Waste\t\t\t\tComposting is one of the best ways that you can help the environment. On average, 60% of all of the waste thrown away in the household is organic matter that could be composted. That organic matter won't break down in a landfill, and it emits methane, which is a greenhouse gas that's 30 times more powerful than carbon. Luckily, composting is easy. You can even use a small tumble bin or an under-the-sink bokashi bin even if you don't have a lot of space at home."

In addition to providing shade, trees absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide and release oxygen. A single tree can produce enough oxygen for four people in a single day. If you\u2019re building a new construction home, try to work around existing trees. You could even incorporate them into your house design, such as building a deck under a huge shady oak.

These coatings are like extremely thick paint and can be applied fairly easily. They are usually white or very light-colored with reflective pigments that reflect, rather than absorb, sunlight. (It is not recommended to apply cool roof coatings to shingle roofs.) If you have a steep-sloped shingled roof, consider replacing your current shingles with cool asphalt shingles. These shingles have specially fabricated granules that reflect sunlight. If you have a metal roof, it already reflects a lot of sunlight.

In the U.S., several tax credits are available for replacing old windows with energy-efficient models. The US Department of Energy has a full list of these credits here. Install a skylight. When chosen wisely, a skylight can provide beautiful natural light to your home while reducing your energy consumption. It\u2019s important to consider your home\u2019s position in order to maximize your skylight\u2019s benefits. Consult a designer or architect. An eco-friendly skylight is more than a hole cut in the roof with some glass in it. Many energy-efficient skylights exist on the market, but they should always be professionally installed to make sure that they are safe and efficient. Use sustainable flooring. Hardwood floors add value and beauty to a home, but many of the trees used in hardwood flooring take years to grow. If your house is up for a new floor, consider using sustainable materials such as bamboo instead. Bamboo grows very quickly and takes less land to produce, but it\u2019s still attractive and durable. Cork is another sustainable wood flooring option. Cork is softer than bamboo, so it absorbs noise and feels cushiony underfoot. It is sometimes less durable than bamboo. Plant trees. Shade trees can reduce the amount of energy you spend to cool your house on hot summer days. If your property doesn\u2019t already have shade trees, this is a step that will take some time before you see the full benefit. In addition to providing shade, trees absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide and release oxygen. A single tree can produce enough oxygen for four people in a single day. If you\u2019re building a new construction home, try to work around existing trees. You could even incorporate them into your house design, such as building a deck under a huge shady oak. Place deciduous trees (trees that shed their leaves annually) near the south and west sides of your home. This will help them block harsh afternoon sunlight in the summer, but let sunlight reach your home during the winter. Install a \u201ccool roof.\u201d Cool roofs reflect sunlight rather than absorbing it. This helps reduce your home\u2019s energy consumption. It can also extend the life of your roof. These roofs are especially good for people who live in hot climates, since they reduce the need for air conditioning. Cool roof coatings are available at many home supply stores and warehouses. These coatings are like extremely thick paint and can be applied fairly easily. They are usually white or very light-colored with reflective pigments that reflect, rather than absorb, sunlight. (It is not recommended to apply cool roof coatings to shingle roofs.) If you have a steep-sloped shingled roof, consider replacing your current shingles with cool asphalt shingles. These shingles have specially fabricated granules that reflect sunlight. If you have a metal roof, it already reflects a lot of sunlight. However, these roofs absorb a lot of heat, which can increase your energy consumption in the summer. Painting your metal roof with a light color or using a cool roof coating can increase its energy efficiency. Consider installing a composting toilet. Composting toilets usually do not use water to \u201cflush\u201d like traditional toilets. They can also recycle many types of human waste into fertilizer that can be used in agriculture. While they are initially more expensive to install than traditional toilets, they are far more eco-friendly and will eventually pay for themselves. Composting toilets are usually easiest to install and maintain in a rural or suburban setting. If you live in an apartment or urban high-rise, it may more difficult to install and maintain a composting toilet. Use durable siding. Materials such as cedar naturally repel pests and water. They are also durable and low-maintenance. Replace old aluminum siding with a more sustainable option. There are other eco-friendly siding options, such as fiber cement board and particle board. These are durable and sustainable. Look for products that have been manufactured without formaldehyde. Talk with a design team about a \u201cwhole-house systems approach.\u201d If you are designing a new home or doing extensive renovations on an older home, consider talking with a design team about a \u201cwhole-house systems approach.\u201d This extensive approach considers many factors about your home, including local climate, your site\u2019s specific conditions, your appliance needs, etc. Because it takes all these factors into account, a whole-house systems approach can drastically reduce your energy consumption. Many designers and architects have experience in whole-house systems approach construction. Visit the National Association of Home Builders for more advice on finding a design team.",
