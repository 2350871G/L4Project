Then muddle the chopped celery in the tin. Finally, pour 1/2 oz. (15 mL) of blood orange olive oil over top. Blood orange olive oil is a unique blend of extra virgin olive oil and blood oranges, and you can find it at most grocery stores. If you're having trouble finding it, you can order it online. Muddling is a process of pressing ingredients in a cocktail shaker to release their flavors into the cocktail. If you don't have a muddling tool, you can use the back of a spoon."

Simple syrup is available at most grocery and liquor stores, but it\u2019s also very simple to make.
