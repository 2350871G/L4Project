Make the rice flour batter. Add two cups of water to one cup of rice flour and mix together. You want there to be no visible lumps and for the mixture to be a liquid, batter-like consistency. Mix in \u00bc teaspoon cumin seeds and \u00bd teaspoon salt to the batter. Cook the batter over boiling water. Boil two cups of water. Grease a metal plate with oil. Pour batter on the plate, covering the entirety of it. Put the metal plate on top of the boiling water then put a lid over it. Cook for 2-3 minutes on medium heat. Take the papad off of the plate. When the papad is finished cooking, take it off of the metal plate carefully with a knife. The papads will change color from white to light brown when they are finished cooking. Lay the papad on a cotton cloth. Make the rest of the papads. Continue to put the papad batter on the metal plate. Make one papad at a time. Spread the papads evenly on a cotton cloth.
