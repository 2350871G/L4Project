      "description":"With this party it's a great excuse for fancy dress, it will add to the theme and help to create a great atmosphere. Pirate costumes are so easy to put together, here's a few ideas for you:\nOld pairs of trousers can be tucked into wellies / boots or into long socks. Or you can cut them off at the knees and make them ragged or tie them around the leg just under the knee. An old shirt or t-shirt can be used and if you don't mind then again a few well placed tears help with the look. If you have an old waistcoat then these look great over the shirts. I have even used an old striped pillowcase:\nCut across the bottom of the open end and remove the flap. Cut up the centre of one side and then near the top of the closed end cut outwards to the left and right creating a V shape for the neck. Cut out sleeve holes on both sides. It doesn't have to be perfect, once all the other elements are added you'll be surprised just how great it will look. Next a couple of belts are needed, these can be fastened on the last holes and then placed over the shoulders, one left one right so that they cross over the chest. If there are no hats available then a bandannas create a classic pirate look. A bright piece of material or scarf can be tied around the waist and fastened to the side like a sash, the pirates sword can be secured here. A bit of costume junk Jewellery looks good hanging out of pockets or just placed around the neck, the pirate's ill gotten gains...\n\nPirate party ideas for those nice little touches that turn a good costume into great:\na rolled up map\na parrot\na sword\na small treasure chest\nan eye patch\nFace paint can add a great touch, scars and battle wounds, black marks, black eyes and teeth."

      "description":"Not everyone lives where the weather will allow outside parties but a pirate party can easily be transferred inside. I find here that having your party inside, lends itself to the theme of a 'Secret Pirates Cave.' Here are a few pirate party ideas for indoors...\nUse coloured lighting - remove the usual light bulbs and replace with red and green light bulbs these seem to work the best. If you can place some in lamps too, that helps. Make some rooms green and some red, when you mix two colours in one room they seem to lose their effect a little. Use bright, silky and sparkly material to drape over doorways so that other rooms remain hidden until you go through. Drape sheets and materials over tables and chairs and then pile on top your treasure chests and pirate loot. Loosely spread around odd bits, metallic cups, vases, costume jewellery, beads that look like jewels. Place signs on doors either inviting them in or barring the way...\n\"Dead man's chest\"\n\"Tricky man's tavern\"\n\"Only the foolhardy enter\"\nA skull and crossbones\n\nPlace a couple of palm trees painted on large sections of cardboard around the garden. Again you can get these from local super markets. Paint and cut out simple shapes of barrels that would be found around a harbour. Print pictures of brightly coloured parrots out and glue on the cardboard and place these around the garden, maybe perch them up in trees. Draw an old looking treasure map maybe base it on the garden, later it can be used in a treasure hunt game. You could use a tent and decorate the inside as a cave and place the treasure inside. If you're indoors maybe you could select one room for this purpose, keeping the lighting low to add mystery."
