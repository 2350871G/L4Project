A \u00be in (2 cm) thickness is ideal, especially if you live in an apartment and there are folks who live beneath you. If noise is not an issue, \u00bd in (1.3 cm) thick plywood will work. Plywood usually comes in 4x8 ft (1.2x2.4 m) boards. Two of these boards positioned side-by-side is usually ideal for a home dance floor."

Be sure to follow the directions of your sealant closely, as they will help ensure a good, smooth seal. Apply three or four coats and sand the surface before each coat. Once a coat has dried, walk around the board and look at from several angles. Pay extra attention to any patches that aren\u2019t shiny when applying the next layer."

If you\u2019re using \u00bd in (1.3 cm) plywood and \u00bd in (1.3 cm) rounded trim, the outside edge of the trim (which will include the angled portion) will be 8 ft (2.4 m) and 1 in (2.5 cm) long.
