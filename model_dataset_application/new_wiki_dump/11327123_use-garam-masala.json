You can use it by itself or combine it with other spices like onion powder, pepper, salt, and coriander. Mix the spices together in a bowl and apply a layer to the entire surface of any meat you're cooking. Coat the meat in olive oil to help the dry rub stick. Make sure to cover the top and bottom of the meat. If you\u2019re cooking a whole chicken, coat the inside of the chicken as well. Use the \u201cwet hand-dry hand\u201d method of dry rub application. Take a handful of rub in one hand and sprinkle it on the meat, then use the other hand to rub the spices around. Continue this method until you\u2019ve covered every surface of the meat. Let the meat sit for 30 minutes to absorb the dry rub."
