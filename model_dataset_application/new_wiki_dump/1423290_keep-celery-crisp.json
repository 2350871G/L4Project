          "description":"Celery often goes bad fast because it releases ethylene, a ripening hormone. When wrapped in foil, foil allow the ethylene to escape. If celery is stored in a loose plastic bag, ethylene is trapped, which will cause the celery to get limp. Aluminum foil prevents celery from becoming overripe and losing crispness. Ethylene is a hormone plants give off naturally. It's an aging and ripening hormone, which causes plants to ripen and then decompose. While ethylene is necessary to get plants ripe, it can cause decay and overripe plants after a certain point. Storing celery in a plastic bag traps ethylene, causing celery to go bad quicker."
