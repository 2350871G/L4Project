  "text":" Marking a Line with a Pencil Lay the piece of paper on a clean, flat surface. Clear a table, desk, or workstation so it\u2019s clean and free of dirt, debris, or obstructions. Place the paper on the surface so it lies completely flat and there aren\u2019t any bumps or raised sections. An uneven surface will affect your ability to draw a straight line. Place a ruler where you want to cut a straight line on the paper. Choose where you want to cut a straight line on the piece of paper. Take a wooden or metal ruler and place it on the paper so it lies flat where you want to cut it. Line up the back of the ruler with the edge of the paper so you can make a line across it. Mark a light line along the ruler with a pencil. Apply pressure to the ruler with your non-dominant hand so it doesn\u2019t wiggle or slide on the paper. Take a pencil mark along the side of the ruler, tracing a faint line onto the paper. Follow the entire length of the ruler to form a long, straight line. Make a light marking so the line won\u2019t be visible after you cut the paper.Tip: If the ruler isn\u2019t long enough to go all the way across the piece of paper, mark a line, then move the ruler and line it up with the line that you made so you can mark another one. Remove the ruler and pick up the piece of paper. Once you\u2019ve made a line on the paper, take off the ruler and set it aside so it\u2019s out of the way. Pick up the piece of paper in your non-dominant hand so the line is facing up toward you. Holding the paper upright will make it easier for you to cut along the marked line. Cut along the marked line with a pair of scissors. Hold the piece of paper against the edge of the scissors and make your cuts along the straight line on the paper. Open the scissors all the way and cut the paper carefully so it doesn\u2019t move around. Once you make 1 cut, move the scissors deeper into the drawn line and make another cut. Continue cutting until you reach the other side of the piece of paper. Avoid dragging the scissors through the paper or you may not cut a straight line. Making a Crease Fold the paper where you want to make a straight cut and crease it. Take 1 end of the paper and fold it over to connect it with the other side of the paper. Make sure the fold is where you want to cut your line. Use your fingers to squeeze the fold to form a crease. Adjust the fold before you crease the paper so you don\u2019t leave an indentation in it. Run your fingers up and down the crease to make it more visible. Smooth out the paper by folding it the opposite way. Once you\u2019ve made a straight crease, take the piece of paper and fold it the opposite way along the crease. Use your fingers to gently form another crease at the fold. Then, open the paper back up and smooth it out on a flat surface. You should still be able to slightly see the crease on the paper. Cut along the center of the crease to make a straight line. Take a pair of scissors and line up the blade with the center of the crease at the edge of the paper. Cut across the paper, following the center of the crease as a guide. Continue cutting until you reach the other side of the paper. Holding Scissors Correctly Use a pair of scissors made for your dominant hand. Select the correct pair of scissors to make straighter cuts on paper. Choose a pair of right-handed scissors if you\u2019re right-handed and left-handed scissors if you\u2019re left-handed. Left-handed scissors are designed so the top blade is on the left, which allows you to see your cutting line better.Did You Know? Some scissors are labeled as ambidextrous with handles that are designed to fit into either hand. But the positioning of the blades are often on the right side, making them more effective for right-handed users. Place your thumb through the smaller hole on the scissor handles. Hold the pair of scissors so the smaller hole is on top. Fit your thumb through the hole from the right side if you\u2019re right-handed or the left side if you\u2019re left-handed. Allow the bottom handle of the scissors to rest in your hand. If the scissors have 2 of the same size holes, hold the scissors so the top blade is on the same side as your dominant hand. Insert your index and middle fingers into the larger hole on the handles. Once you\u2019ve fit your thumb into the top hole, slide the index and middle fingers of the same hand into the larger bottom hole. Keep a gentle squeeze on the handles so the scissors remain closed until you\u2019re ready to use them. Curl your ring and pinkie fingers into your hand so they\u2019re out of the way.

Open and close the scissors with your thumb for stability. Line up your scissors with the paper you want to cut. Keep your index and middle fingers still so they don\u2019t move.
