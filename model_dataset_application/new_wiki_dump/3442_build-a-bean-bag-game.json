If you want, have the local hardware store cut it for you if you don't feel confident enough to do it yourself. Sand the edges down. This is to smooth out the ends to prevent anything from catching on them. Paint the board background a solid color.  Cup targets Cut the bottoms off five or six plastic cups about two inches (5 cm) high. Staple or nail the bottoms to the board in whatever arrangement you want. It is recommended to put one in each corner and one in the middle. Paint a numerical value above the cup. Paint a \"5\" for each corner cup and a \"10\" for the middle cup. Beanbags Use a strong cloth for the beanbags. Cut the cloth into squares or rectangular shapes\u2013\u2013probably 2 1/2\" (6.35 cm) will be big enough for a square shape. Sew around the square or rectangle, leaving enough room to pour in the beans. Pour the beans into each beanbag. Use a funnel to help if needed. Then close the bag up with a few outside stitches. Ensure that it is tied off securely. Making rules for playing the game Assign your own values to the cups and make your own rules for winning the game. You can make it short or long, depending on the number of \"rounds\" players want to toss through. Finished. ",
