Fill the water reservoir with 2 cups (470 ml) of water. Place the coffee pot below the drip spout and turn the coffee maker on. Allow the coffee to brew, which will take about 5 minutes. For coffee ice cubes that aren't as strong, use 5 tablespoons (26 g) of coffee instead. You can also brew the coffee using the pour over method or cowboy style if you don\u2019t have any coffee making equipment."

It\u2019s important to remove the pot from the coffee maker, otherwise the hot plate on the bottom will extend the cooling time."

Because a standard ice cube tray has 16 wells, your pot of coffee will fit perfectly into a standard ice cube tray. Depending on the size of your ice cube tray, you may have to use 2 trays to make the coffee cubes. You can use either plastic or silicone trays for coffee ice cubes.
