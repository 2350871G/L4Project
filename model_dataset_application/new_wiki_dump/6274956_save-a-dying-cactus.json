          "description":"If parts of the cactus appear shrunken, wrinkled, or wilting (drooping or appearing limp), it probably needs more water. If the soil is fully dry, water it thoroughly, allowing excess water to drain out the bottom of the pot. If the soil is not dry, the problem could be a condition called etiolation, where the rounded or stem-shaped parts of the cactus become narrower. This tells you that the cactus needs more sunlight, so move the pot to a southern- or western-facing window."

If the soil is soaked throughout, remove the plant and repot in a measured soil blend. If it is not entirely soaked, let the soil dry completely before watering again. A standard mixture of soil for cacti of desert origin consists of two parts garden soil, two parts coarse sand, and one part peat."
