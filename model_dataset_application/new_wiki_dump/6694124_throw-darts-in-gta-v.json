If you want to win the game as quickly as possible, aim for the middle ring in the section marked \u201c20.\u201d Landing all three darts there will reduce your score by 180 points. The numbers around the dartboard represent the point value for each section. Throwing a dart onto the white or black areas will reduce your score by that point value. If a dart lands on the outermost ring, you\u2019ll reduce your score by double the point value. If it lands on the middle ring, your score will be reduced by triple the point value. Throwing a dart onto the ring around the bullseye will reduce your score by 25 points, while landing it on the bullseye will reduce your score by 50 points. You can steady your aim once per leg, but it only lasts a moment. To steady your aim, either hold down the right trigger (on Xbox and Playstation consoles) or the right mouse button if you\u2019re playing on a PC."

This will set you up for a win with a bullseye. Alternatively, you can aim for a triple 20, then a triple 7. Doing this will set you up for a win with with a double 40, which is easier to hit than a bullseye."

If you missed any of the previous points, you will need to do the math to figure out the most efficient way to get to 0 with a bullseye or double. If you are on your last dart of your second turn and need an odd point value to win, this will require another turn. For instance, if you have 17 points to go, it will take another turn, since you cannot score 17 points with a bullseye or double. If your score dips below 0, your score will stay the same as before that turn. It will then be your opponent\u2019s turn to throw a dart."
