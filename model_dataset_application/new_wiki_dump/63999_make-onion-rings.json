  "text":" Place  some aluminum foil on your counter close to your stove and put two large mixing bowls on top. Meanwhile, put some paper towels onto a plate, or bowl. This will be used to drain the cooked onion rings. Fill one of the bowls about halfway to two thirds full with milk. Add the eggs and some of the seasonings. Mix ingredients well. Fill the other bowl with flour and the remaining seasonings, then mix.  Cut medium or large onion into rings, according to how many onion rings you want, and place them to the side.  Put fresh vegetable oil in a large frying pan around half an inch deep. Use moderate heat. Dip one of the onion slices that you set aside into the milk, and then into the flour. Repeat until it the slice is thoroughly covered in the batter (about 3 times). Carefully lower the slice into the pan. Use a fork or metal tongs to get the slices into the pan. Repeat the above dipping process until there is no more room in the frying pan.  When the onion rings are golden brown, carefully turn them over. Watch out; the oil is hot. Once both sides are golden brown , remove them from the pan and place them onto the paper towel- covered plate or bowl. Continue to make onion rings, repeating steps six through eight.
