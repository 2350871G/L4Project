For instance, if you have a family of three people or less, and have only one or two bathrooms in your home, a small to midsize water softener will be adequate. If you're a family of four or more people, and you have more than three bathrooms, you will need a mid to large sized softener."

Renting may be a more cost effective solution, at least temporarily, and it will allow you to test a system to see if it is right for you. It will also give you the benefit of soft water and less damage to your appliances, home, and hair and skin."

These scale-control devices can reduce scaling in pipes but they are not proven to remove calcium. Salt-free conditioners require much less maintenance than regular water softeners, cost less to run, and often yield a better return on investment."

These shower heads use replaceable filters to soften water as soon as you install them, and cost very little in comparison to larger water softeners. Read reviews online and be sure to choose a model that comes with a warranty."

To prepare soft water to wash with, add one tablespoon (0.5 oz.) of aluminum sulfate to a small bucket of water. Once the minerals have settled to the bottom, skim water off of the top with a small cup or bowl. Use it to wash your face, take a sponge bath, or rinse your hair."
