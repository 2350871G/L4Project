The leather will look considerably darker after doing this, but don\u2019t panic, it will soon start lightening. If you\u2019re worried about damaging your Louis Vuitton leather, or you have a stain that just won\u2019t budge, consider paying for a professional clean. Getting a technician to clean your leather can really help remove anxiety about the process and even save you from making any costly mistakes."
