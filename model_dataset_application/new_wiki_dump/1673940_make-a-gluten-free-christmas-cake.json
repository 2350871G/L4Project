If you prefer, substitute whiskey or use orange juice for a non-alcoholic option. It's important to use an alcohol that has a rich, warm taste so it adds to the flavor of the fruit. Avoid substituting bitter or flavorless alcohol, such as gin or vodka."

Some gluten-free flour mixes also contain fine polenta, chestnut flour, sorghum flour, and additional starches. Corn flour is also called cornstarch. If you prefer, purchase a gluten-free flour to use instead of the ground almonds, rice flour, and corn flour. Use a total of 1 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (230 g) of the gluten-free flour mix."

Use a stand or hand mixer to beat the mixture on medium speed for 3 to 5 minutes or until the butter is pale and fluffy. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally.
