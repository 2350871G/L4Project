They might trip and they can't move around well, and they might lose their favorite stuffed animals under a pile of other stuff. Tell them that giving away toys that are \"too young\" for them or toys they just don't play with will make room for newer, more interesting toys they might get for their birthday or Christmas. Tell them that giving things up is a part of growing up and being a big kid. Stay side-by-side with them the whole time to keep their spirits up and encourage them. Try to make it as pleasant an experience as you can. Start small; ask them to find five or ten toys (depending on how many they have) that they would be okay with giving up."

Making a pile of your child's absolute favorite toys may be a good idea, too. Get containers and shelving. Square or cubby shelving could work well, and clear plastic bins allow the child(ren) to see the contents of a particular container.

Keeping it Organized Avoid showering your kid(s) in toys. Your organizational efforts will go to waste if your child's toy collection outgrows them. Balance toys the child receives with toys he/she gives away. Establish rules about cleaning up. For instance, a playroom rule could be that only five toys can be out at a time, or that the room must be cleaned up before bedtime or leaving the house. Hold your child accountable for this; you have set up a simple system for them to follow, so they should follow it. Enjoy seeing your child's free, organized play space. ",
