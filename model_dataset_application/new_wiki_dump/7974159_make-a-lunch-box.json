          "description":"Before you touch scissors to fabric, you'll first have to choose the kind of fabric you'll be using. The printed fabric will make up the most visible part of your lunch box, and the accent fabric will be used for a pocket. Sturdy fabrics, like linen or some kind of cotton blend, should be prioritized, as these will hold up better to wear and tear. In all, for the printed fabric and vinyl, you'll need about 15\" by 50\" (38.1 by 127 cm) of material. For the accent fabric, you'll only need about 5\" by 5\" (12.7 by 12.7 cm) of material. Your imagination is the limit when you're choosing fabrics. For kids, you might want to choose themed fabrics, such as dinosaur or princess prints. You should be able to purchase themed or patterned fabrics at your local craft or hobby store. Avoid vinyl with cloth backing. The vinyl will line the inside of your lunch box to protect the fabric if something spills."

          "description":"Your lunch box will be made of a single piece of fabric that has been lined with vinyl on the inside. Two smaller pieces will close off the sides of your lunch box. To make these pieces, you'll need to:\nMeasure 25\u00bd\" by 7\" (64.87 cm by 17.8 cm) on the vinyl and fabric with a ruler, then cut these free with scissors. Use a ruler to measure and use the scissors to cut two pieces that are 8\u00bc\" by 4\" (21 cm by 10.2 cm) from both the fabric and vinyl. You can ensure straighter cuts by using chalk to mark out the dimensions of the fabric pieces."

          "description":"For each fabric piece you have, you should also have a vinyl piece. Attach the cloth and vinyl pieces together by laying the vinyl on a clean drop cloth, spraying it with adhesive, then pressing the fabric into place atop the vinyl. Spray adhesive can create a big mess if you're not careful. A clean drop cloth will protect your work surface and prevent glue from spreading around your work area. The fumes that come off some spray adhesives can be harmful to your health. Make sure the area you do your gluing is well ventilated to prevent the build up of dangerous fumes. Smooth the fabric with your fingers so it lies flat against the vinyl. To prevent bunching, you may want to smooth it starting from one side to the opposite. Longer pieces can be difficult to glue while keeping the fabric and vinyl in alignment. Try rolling up longer fabric pieces and unrolling them onto the vinyl. In this way, you can glue long pieces a little bit at a time."

Different brands of glue will have different recommended dry times. Follow the glue manufacturer's instructions for best results. If you're unsure about how long you should allow the glue to dry, you may want to allow it to dry overnight, as many glues set within 8 to 10 hours."

Use a ruler to measure 7\" (17.8 cm) inward from one of the short edges of the fabric. Then:\nUse a chalk to mark this 7\"-mark close to the middle of the fabric. This mark will be where the top of the pocket is. Use a ruler to center the pocket so that it has an equal amount of free space on either end of the short side of the fabric.
