Paint over clashing or lifeless shades on solid items for a piece that\u2019s totally your own. This can be done in a matter of hours, but you\u2019ll enjoy the rebirth of your favorite book shelf or end table for years. Best of all, you can strip and repaint a piece as often as you like, which means the possibilities are nearly endless. Sand wooden surfaces to remove the old paint and help the new paint hold better. Prep your surface with a primer, use 2 coats of paint for a smooth, even finish, and seal the paint  with a lacquer when you\u2019re finished to preserve it. Use painter\u2019s tape to layer paint with multiple colors and create dazzling designs. Note that if the furniture has laminate or acrylic surfaces, it will take specialized preparation and materials to paint over."

          "description":"IKEA specializes in sleek, contemporary designs, but what if you want to impart a more quaint, time-worn look to your home or apartment? Put aging furniture through the ringer by distressing it yourself at home. Sand down an unremarkable wood surface, then stain it for a rich antique finish. Adorn ordinary fixtures with rustic materials like burlap, leather, and wicker. Suddenly, your home will go from sterile to tastefully rugged. Try wet-sanding painted surfaces to make them look faded. Distressing IKEA furniture the right way can give it that aesthetic of age and coziness that it\u2019s sometimes lacking. For a rustic or shabby chic look, you can use chalk paint, which can be found at most craft and hardware stores."

Be on the lookout for unconventional materials you could use to create custom pieces that really make a statement. For instance, those with an interest in nautical imagery could embellish wall hangings with ropes tied into sailor\u2019s knots, or you could resurface your MALM desk with a mosaic of paint spatters if you\u2019re an artist. Have fun and let your creativity take over! Personalizing your IKEA purchases doesn\u2019t have to be an elaborate process. It could be as straightforward as adding a border, sewing on fabric accents or changing out small details like buttons, cushions or trim. If you\u2019re looking to upgrade a bookcase, add wallpaper or contact paper on the back support for a fun twist. Websites like Pinterest contain a wealth of ideas for how to customize furniture and craft new features."

A classic BILLY bookcase turned on its side becomes a convenient cubby nook for stashing personal belongings. A BEKVAM spice rack mounted on the wall turns into an unobtrusive place to hang winter coats. Get inventive and consider what functions your existing furniture could serve beyond its intended purpose. You could also add a cushion to a simple bench with a solid seat. Repurpose old pieces that you no longer have any use for rather than just throwing them away."

New companies are popping up that specialize in designing high-quality furniture covers that fit like a glove over popular IKEA models. A drab white EKTORP sofa could be totally transformed with a tasteful floral print, or dazzling mint green criss-crossed with Chevron. Slip covers can be found for many of the best-selling IKEA pieces. With these, you can enjoy the comfort and longevity of your furniture without being locked into the look.

Certain businesses now specialize in designing eye-catching furniture legs that can lend a little character to your tired pieces without the need to completely redecorate.

These ornate touches will lend a bit of bling without distracting from the main focus of the piece. Sometimes, little changes can make a big difference. Pick out hardware that will provide a pleasant contrast to the rest of the piece, like gold knobs and hinges on a black BRIMNES cabinet or leather loop handles on an old-fashioned GALANT drawer unit. For lavish original accessories, give modern furniture pioneers like Superfront a shot. IKEA\u2019s wooden furniture has paintable knobs.

Simply smooth the vinyl sticker onto your bureau or tabletop and watch it go from boring wood grain to any of hundreds of full-color art prints. If you\u2019re the kind of person that likes to alter the look of your furniture often, these could be just what you need. These stick-on accents can easily be applied and removed, and won\u2019t leave behind any sticky, damaging residue.
