This position is also best for people with deep-set eyes, as it lets you place the retracted cups onto your pronounced brows. Keep an eye out for grit and dust, as this position is more exposed to the elements. Use the retracted position if you wear eyeglasses."

Extend them by pulling them as far away from the barrels as possible. Although it limits your field of view, it's the best choice for getting a close look at a specific object in the center of your view. Be wary of fogging during cold weather when your eyecups are extended. If you don't wear eyeglasses, use the extended position."
