If the kiwi is rock hard, it isn't quite ripe. You should be able to press it in slightly. If the kiwi gives too much, it is overripe. The kiwi should not feel mushy."

Simply place the kiwi fruit in a paper bag and leave it out at room temperature. In a day or two, it should be ready to eat. Kiwi fruit releases an enzyme that causes it to ripen. Storing it at room temperature in a paper bag speeds up the process. You can add a ripe apple or banana to make it go even faster. Don't try it with a plastic bag. It's important to have a little air circulation in the bag so that the kiwi doesn't end up tasting bad or rotting."
