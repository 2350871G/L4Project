  "text":" Prepare the Greens Fill a large bowl with cold water.  Place greens in the bowl. Some water may overflow if you overfilled the bowl, so it\u2019s a good idea to place the bowl in the sink before submerging the greens.

To start to devein the leaves, take one collard green leaf and bend it in half along the vein.  Rip the leaves from the vein. Discard the vein and place the torn leaves in a separate bowl.

Allow it to heat without burning, turning the pan frequently to distribute the oil or vegan butter over the bottom of it. Place the garlic into the hot oil or butter. Reduce the heat to medium. Stir the garlic frequently to prevent burning. Place one batch of collard greens into the skillet. Allow the greens to wilt completely before adding another batch.
