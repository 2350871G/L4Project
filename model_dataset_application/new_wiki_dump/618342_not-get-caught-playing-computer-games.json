          "description":"While a computer game\u2019s sound is often an important part of the playing experience, you\u2019ll want to turn the sound off completely if you want to avoid getting caught playing a game. The sounds of your game will tip off anyone in earshot, and you won\u2019t be able to hear anyone approaching from other parts of the house or office. While it\u2019s a little riskier, you can always choose to play with headphones on and just leave one of the earbuds or headphones in. Try to avoid playing games that require sound if you\u2019re trying to play a game undetected."

Windowed mode will make your game show up on a portion of your screen, and you\u2019ll see the border around the game with the three buttons at the top of the window. You want quick access to those buttons, since they allow you to minimize and exit the game immediately. Borderless is not the same as windowed mode. Borderless means that you can move your mouse off of the game when it\u2019s in fullscreen mode and on to a second monitor if you have one."
