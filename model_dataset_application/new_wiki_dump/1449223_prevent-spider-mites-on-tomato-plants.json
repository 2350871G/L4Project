          "description":"Tomato plants need at least 7 hours of sunlight every day to grow successfully. Plant your tomatoes outside in a location that gets enough sunlight, but isn\u2019t in the direct path of the afternoon sun. Tomato plants that are in the perfect environment, with sufficient sunlight and moisture, will be much less likely to develop a spider mite infestation. Also consider planting your tomatoes in a location where they can take advantage of radiant heat, such as next to large boulders or a building. If planting your tomatoes in a pot, take advantage of the fact that you can move those pots if required. Move the pots into the morning sun each day, then move them out of the direct afternoon sun to prevent them from drying out."

          "description":"In general, tomato plants aren\u2019t overly fussy when it comes to the soil, however, the proper soil conditions will help ensure the soil stays moist and will not create conditions where spider mites may thrive. Plant your tomato plants in soil that is loamy, with lots of organic matter (compost, peat moss, or manure). The pH level of the soil for tomato plants should be between 6.0 and 7.0. If you\u2019re planting your tomatoes in pots, use high-quality vegetable potting soil to preserve soil moisture. Also, use vegetable fertilizer in your pots to provide your tomato plants with sufficient nutrients."

When planting your tomatoes (either in your garden or in a pot/container), spray the soil under the plants with homemade hot pepper or garlic spray to keep spider mites away and prevent them from harming your tomato plants. For the hot pepper spray, add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of cayenne pepper flakes to 1 cup (240 mL) of water in a spray bottle. Shake the bottle to mix the ingredients and allow them to sit for at least 24 hours before using it. For the garlic spray, add 2 mashed garlic cloves to 1 litre (4.2  c) of water in a bowl or jug. Allow the mixture to sit for 24 hours and then strain out the garlic pieces. Put the mixture into a spray bottle to use."

          "description":"Purchase food-grade diatomaceous earth (D.E.) from a garden centre, hardware store, or online. Sprinkle the D.E. on the soil, in unbroken rings, around your tomato plants. You can also sprinkle or dust the D.E. directly onto the leaves of your tomato plants. Spider mites will not attempt to cross the D.E. barrier around the plants, but you do need to reapply D.E. after it\u2019s rained or you\u2019ve soaked the plants. D.E. is the powdered fossilized skeletons of microscopic organisms called diatoms. It is a mined substance that is found in areas where lakes were present millions of years ago. Do not apply any D.E. to the flowers on your tomato plants. D.E. doesn\u2019t distinguish between good and bad insects and may harm pollinators if applied to the tomato plant flowers."

First, it will be easier to control the humidity around your plants when they\u2019re indoors. Second, having your tomato plants indoors may help you prevent and/or control spider mites. If only some of your tomato plants are infested with spider mites, keep them outside and move the uninfested plants indoors to protect them. If all of your tomato plants are infested with spider mites, spray down the plants with a hose before moving them inside.

The mulch will keep the soil moist, but will also help control weeds and prevent ground rot. You can use commercial mulch that comes in plastic bags from a garden centre, or you can use straw. When laying the mulch on the ground, keep a 1 in (2.5 cm) space around the stem of your tomato plants to prevent fungal problems."

          "description":"Watering your tomato plants frequently and lightly can cause tomatoes to crack or the blossoms of the plants to rot. It can also allow the development of foliage disease. Soak the soil around your tomato plants every 7 to 10 days instead. When soaking your tomatoes, spray the undersides of the leaves with your hose to remove any initial spider mites that may have started to make a home. If the soil around your tomato plants is drying out before your next watering day, increase the frequency of the soaking. Tomatoes planted in pots may need to be soaked more frequently, as pots tend to dry out faster."

Spray your tomato plants with a hose, especially on the undersides of the leaves, on a weekly basis. This spray will help keep spider mites away and will also water your tomato plants. This method can be used on tomatoes planted in a garden and planted in pots. Be careful that the spray of water isn\u2019t too strong that it damages the tomato plants. You may want to use the nozzle and spray upwards on the plants to get the undersides of the leaves. Or, hold the leaves with your hands and turn them over before spraying them."

This water will keep the soil moist, which in turn, should help keep spider mites away. This method will only work for tomato plants in pots. However, if you put your tomato plants in a garden, you can leave buckets or pots of water in and around your plants to increase the general moisture around your tomatoes. This is especially important when the conditions are hot and dry. Tomato plants that are water-stressed are more susceptible to spider mite infestations."
