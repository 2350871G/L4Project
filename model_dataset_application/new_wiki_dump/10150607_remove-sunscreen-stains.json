Sprinkle a generous amount of it on the stain and double check to make sure you've got the area covered completely. Apart from baking soda, you can use talcum powder and cornstarch as well. They also serve as absorbents. If you're dealing with a stain that's turning brown, soak it in lemon juice and cover with salt instead.
