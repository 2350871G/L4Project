          "description":"Cook White Rice the day before you want to make kimchi fried rice. Use short grain Korean rice if possible, also called sticky rice or Japanese rice. Short grain rice is more authentic and has a different texture than regular long grain rice. You can find short grain rice at most Asian markets and some grocery stores. If you can't find short grain rice, use Jasmine rice or regular white rice. If you are cooking short grain rice, soak the rice for 30 minutes before cooking it. Soaking the rice helps it to cook evenly and have a better texture. After you've soaked your short grain rice, use a 1:1 ratio of rice to water instead of the usual 1:2 ratio. The rice already absorbed some water from soaking, so the normal 1:2 ratio would be using too much water."
