  "text":" Preparing the Croutons Slice your baguette diagonally for a rustic look. After you remove the croutons from the oven, they will continue to grow more crisp as they cool. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180\u00b0C). Spray a flat sheet with nonstick spray. Brush both sides of each slice with oil.  Place the slices on a sheet. Bake them for a minute, flip them over, and bake them an additional minute. Set the croutons to the side and allow them to cool.  Preparing the Soup Heat a saucepan. Add the oil and heat it until the oil is shimmering. Place the slices in the saucepan and cook them, stirring them constantly, until they are soft and brown. This should take approximately 20 minutes. Pour the water into the saucepan over the onions and bring the water to a boil.  Mix in the miso and the thyme with a spoon until the ingredients are well combined. Lower the heat until the soup is simmering. Taste the soup and add salt and pepper until the seasonings are to your liking. Continue to simmer the ingredients for minutes. Broiling the Topping Place your rack about 12\" (35 centimeters) from the broiler. When you add the sheet with the bowls, the top of your soup should be about 6\" to 8\" (15 to 20 centimeters) from the broiler itself. Preheat your broiler.  Place 4 small bowls or crocks on a sheet or pan. You may want to cover the sheet or pan with foil so that cleanup is easy in case the soup or cheese dribbles out of the bowls. Divide the soup among the bowls.  Place croutons on top of each bowl of soup.  Top each cup of soup with Gruyere.  Put the sheet or pan and the bowls into the oven under the broiler.  Broil the soup until the cheese starts to brown and the soup begins to bubble.  Remove the bowls of soup from the oven and serve them immediately.  Finished. ",
