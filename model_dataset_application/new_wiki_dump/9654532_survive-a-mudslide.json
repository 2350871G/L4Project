          "description":"If your area has been recently hit by a fire and heavy rain is predicted, start watching the news a day or 2 before the storm is predicted. Listen for evacuation orders, which should be broadcast as soon as they\u2019re put in place. You should plan to leave even when evacuation is voluntary. Voluntary evacuation can quickly become mandatory, and leaving earlier will give you more time to prepare and safer roads to drive on. You can evacuate to a friend or close family member\u2019s home, or a hotel if you can afford it. If money is tight, head to an evacuation center, which could be at a sports stadium or local school. If you have pets, make sure you can bring them along to your destination. Most evacuation centers will allow them, and hotels often make exceptions to pet policies in emergency situations. If you choose not to evacuate, or if a mudslide was not predicted or expected, it\u2019s essential that you\u2019re able to identify mudslide warning signs. Read on to know what to look for and how to ride out the mudslide."

          "description":"When you see warning signs of a mudslide or hear of them on the news, begin evacuating. Listen carefully to reports so you can avoid driving through other areas at risk. Drive carefully and avoid flooded roads, which may occur if the mudslides are caused by heavy rain. If you see a flooded street, turn around and find an alternate route. Never drive through water of an unknown depth. Even 6 inches (15 cm) of water can cause cars to stall; 1 foot (30 cm) will make most cars float, while 2 feet (61 cm) moving water can carry away even large cars. Look out for and avoid downed power lines. If you have time, warn neighbors of the danger. If the mudslide is not yet in the news, call your fire or police department."
