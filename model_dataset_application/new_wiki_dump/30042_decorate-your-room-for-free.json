          "description":"Use a tape measure to measure the dimensions of your room (length and width). On a piece of graphing paper, draw a scale image of room where 3 grid squares = 4 inches or 1/3rd of a foot. Include in your floor plan the location and size of doors, windows, closets, fireplaces, etc. Make scale drawings of furniture on a separate piece of paper. Measure the length and width of any large pieces of furniture (e.g. bed, dresser, couch). Cut these out and rearrange them in your drawing to see how much space you have to work with. Carry this plan and furniture cut-outs with you if go shopping or \"dumpster diving\", so you know if you have enough space for something before bringing it home."

You want everything currently in your bedroom to fit comfortably before adding anything new, especially if you have a small bedroom. Add a bed skirt so you can store things under your bed without them being seen. Switch-out a bedside table with one that has drawers for storage or several shelves to hold books."

Decide what you want to place in each storage bin and label it. Use these labels to avoid throwing anything in a bin that does not belong. This will help you stay organized. Arrange storage bins on a shelf or the bottom shelf of a bookcase for easy access. If the bin is in a visible location, use a decorative canvas bin or wicker basket."

Look through your house for lamps that have LED soft white bulbs and swap them with bulbs from your bedroom. Most interior lamps use 40- or 60-watt bulbs, but check first before exchanging a light bulb from another lamp. Incorporate warm, bright colors as accessories (lamps, vases, pillows, etc. ), but do not make them the dominate color in your bedroom."

Tie the strips together around an insert pillow or cotton batting. Use two t-shirts that hold sentimental value, but don't fit anymore to make a pillow. Cut-out a square or rectangular piece (depending on what shape and size you want your pillow) from each shirt. Place the two pieces together and sew together three of the four sides. Stuff with cotton batting or even other t-shirts before sewing the final edge. You can also stuff a pillow with fabric scraps or use an old pillow as an insert pillow."

Too much light exposure at dusk or at night can disrupt your body's natural sleep-wake cycle, known as its circadian rhythm. Make your own curtain rings. Attach your curtains to the rod by tying hooks with fabric, rope, or ribbon. You can also dress-up cheap curtain wrings by wrapping them in different colored fabric.
