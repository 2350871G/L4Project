  "text":" Preparing Fennel for Use Cut the stalks off of the fennel bulb. Rinse the entire fennel plant under cool water before cutting. When you cut off the fennel\u2019s stalks, hold the knife near the bulb. You don\u2019t have to throw the stalks away once they\u2019re removed. They can still be used in a variety of recipes. Cut off the bulb\u2019s roots. The roots of a fennel bulb are entirely inedible, so they should be thrown out. Cut them off in a straight line, so you can stand the bulb up as you cut it down the middle. Slice the bulb down the middle. Make sure to guide your knife all the way through the bulb. Then slice the 2 pieces of bulb exactly the way you did the intact bulb. Position your knife right in the middle of both halves and cut. Throw out the wilted parts of the bulb. You can discern the wilted parts of the bulb from its fresh parts by their texture and coloring. The outside of the bulb will be thicker to the touch and darker than the rest of the bulb. Slice the bulb into thin pieces. Lay the fennel pieces onto their flat sides. Position your knife at the very top of the piece you\u2019re slicing and sink the blade all the way to the bottom, where the root would be. Slice the fennel as thinly as you want. If you want your fennel to be extremely thin, use a mandoline for slicing.

Take 2 bulbs (preferably on the smaller side) and fry them on the stove with salt, onion, chili flakes, and a lemon peel for flavor. Once the ingredients have reached a softer texture, add 12 ounces (340 g) of water to the pan and simmer for a half hour covered, then 15 minutes uncovered until the chutney reduces.

Using Fennel Stalks Brown fennel stalks as a vegetable base. Fennel can make an excellent base to all sorts of dishes, including pastas, soups, stir fries, and stews. Mix the stalks with onions, celery, and herbs to enhance your food\u2019s flavor. Use raw stalks as a salad ingredient. Raw stalks are just as edible as the rest of the fennel. Toss them with baby spinach, sliced onions, and your dressing of choice for an excellent salad with a bit of a kick from the fennel. Use the amount of stalks produced from one bulb. Make vegetable stock out of fennel stalks. Add fennel stalks to boiling water (along with other veggies, like onions, carrots, and celery) to create a tasty vegetable stock. This is a great way to make use of leftover fennel stalks when you aren\u2019t sure what else to do with them. Add fennel stalks to fish before roasting. When you put fresh, seasoned fish into a roasting pan, arrange a few stalks of fennel either on top of or on either side of the fish. The fish will absorb the flavor of the fennel as it cooks. Add fennel stalks to your pesto mixture. You can easily make pesto with pine nuts, basil, olive oil, and a food processor, but fennel can give it a bit more flavor. Throw them into your ingredient mixture before processing the pesto. Use the fennel pesto as a marinade or pasta sauce. The amount of stalks you get from a single fennel bulb should be enough to flavor the pesto. Making Use of Fennel Fronds Turn the fronds into juice or smoothies. You won\u2019t be able to make a full-sized drink using fennel fronds alone; they aren\u2019t big enough. Instead, combine the fennel with other juicing ingredients, such as spinach, carrots, or apples to add some extra sweetness. Chop the fennel fronds and use them as seasoning. Fennel fronds can make for excellent herbs, especially in place of other common herbs, such as fresh parsley. Sprinkle diced fennel leaves on top of your pasta or into your soup or sauces and mix the fennel in until blended. Add chopped fronds as a garnish. Instead of stirring fresh fennel fronds into your pasta sauce, sprinkle it on top of freshly served pasta or along the sides of the plate to beautify it. Spread a large amount of fronds onto a plate and lay roasted fish or chicken on top.",
