          "description":"This quick recipe adds rich flavors to any white fish while in reality is very light and butter-free. Pour 1 \u00bd tbsp lemon juice and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) extra virgin olive oil, rub 2 cloves of garlic (crushed and minced), and sprinkle 1 tsp fresh thyme, sea salt, pepper, and paprika as per your preference all over your fish. Although this recipe gives justice to any white fish, it is ideal for cod. When sprinkling the herbs on the fish, divide them equally along its surface. For whole fish, you can make three diagonal small cuts into the side of the fish, so that the flavors also get into the flesh."

In a bowl add \u00be cup of sour cream, \u00bd tsp salt, \u00bd tsp ground black pepper, \u00bd tsp lemon zest, 1 tsp fresh dill, 3 cloves of garlic, 3 green onions, \u00bd tsp red pepper flakes, lemon juice from \u00bd lemon, and \u2153 cup of grated parmesan cheese.Mix the ingredients together and set aside the bowl. To balance the different flavors in your plate, serve with a simple side dish of fresh vegetables such as green beans, or with orzo, rice, or pasta."

          "description":"This unusual topping is very friendly to most types of white fish, as it keeps the meat moist and tender. In a small bowl add 3 tsp fresh lemon juice, \u00bc cup mayonnaise, 4 mashed anchovy fillets or 1 \u00bd anchovy paste, 1 clove of garlic (minced), 1 tsp Dijon mustard, \u00bd tsp Worcestershire sauce, salt, black pepper, and paprika. Whisk the mixture until is creamy. Then, add \u00bd cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese. Be cautious when seasoning with salt, as the anchovies are already salty. It is advisable to rinse and pat the anchovy fillets dry before mashing. However, for convenience and practicality, you can use anchovy paste."

          "headline":"Use crumbs for a crunchy topping.",
          "description":"Children are especially keen on this recipe, as it reminisces the classic fish fingers. In a pan heat 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) olive oil and saut\u00e9 1 diced onion and 1 clove of garlic (minced). Add 6 tablespoon (88.7 ml) of breadcrumbs and stir for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in 1 \u00bd tsp of fresh minced thyme or dill, 3 tablespoon (44.4 ml) of fresh minced parsley, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Try this recipe especially with frozen fish fillets. You can play around with the quantity of breadcrumbs depending on how thick you like your crunchy layer. Also, instead of using any variety of breadcrumbs, look for panko breadcrumbs, which are made from white bread, are delicate, and have almost no flavor."

Avoid poking the fish with utensils or flipping it during the preparation and baking, as unnecessary and hasty movements will break the fish to pieces. Typically, the fish will already be clean when you purchase it. If not, you can just ask the fishmonger to clean and gut the fish for you."

          "headline":"Coat the fish with fat and season with salt.",
          "description":"First, sprinkle the fish with salt and then rub it, inside and out, with a thin film of extra-virgin oil. Extra-virgin oil is the best option for baking fish thanks to its clean taste and health benefits. However, you could use other cooking oils such as sesame oil or butter. Fish has natural fish oils, so you only need to add very little fat for flavor and to prevent the fish from sticking to your baking pan. If you opt for butter, brush a small amount on the fish. Even though salt is essential for flavor, it draws out the moisture and dries out the fish. For a moist and firm fish, add a pinch of salt, but if you want to top up, do so just before you put it in the oven."

          "description":"Lay your fish on top of a sheet of foil, which is large enough to wrap the fish. Wrap the foil around the fish by crimping the edges of the foil together. The foil reduces oven and utensil cleaning time, but most importantly it seals the aromas. It also ensures that your fish doesn\u2019t dry out, as the moisture stays within the packet and doesn\u2019t spread into the oven."

          "description":"Depending on the size of your fish, whether it is stuffed or not, and whether it is in foil or not, cooking temperature and cooking time may vary. For example, 35 ounces (0.99 kg) of whole fish, wrapped in foil with light stuffing should cook for about 1 hour in 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C). Use the conventional heating function of your oven, which you will recognize as the symbol with two lines; one at the top and one at the bottom of a square. This setting distributes heat evenly throughout the oven. The fish can go in the tray horizontally, or if too long, place it diagonally. If you are baking fish fillets and one end is skinnier, fold it to create even thickness, so that all parts are equally cooked."

Remove the fish from the oven, if the thermometer shows anything between 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C) to 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C), depending on how well-done you prefer your fish. However, if this tool isn\u2019t available in your kitchen, press the fish with your fingertip or a utensil, and if it flakes easily, it is ready. Alternatively, you can use a toothpick to help you check for doneness. Stick the toothpick into the fish\u2019s thickest part, and if the meat is a bit firm and the toothpick comes out clean, your fish is ready. Baked white fish is very delicate and tender, and it can fall apart easily. Don\u2019t turn the fish unless you judge that you absolutely must do so. If you decide to turn the fish, use two spatulas instead of one for more support."
