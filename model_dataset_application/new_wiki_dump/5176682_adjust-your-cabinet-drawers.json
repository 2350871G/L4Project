NOTE: Because of the way the glides are designed and mounted, it is very unlikely that a drawer would bind at the bottom. Fixing a Drawer Glide Wheel That Derails Identify a drawer with wheels that drop off the track as the drawer is closed. Typical drawer glide designs consist of a pair of rails that are mounted to the drawer and a pair of rails that are mounted to the cabinet. The drawer rails have a small wheel located at the end near the back of the drawer and the cabinet rails have a small wheel located near the face frame of the cabinet. The drawer wheel travels along the track of the cabinet rail, while the wheel on the cabinet rail supports the track of the drawer rail. Either the right or left cabinet rail has a \u201chooked\u201d channel along the top edge to keep the drawer wheel securely in the track. The corresponding drawer rail has a slightly \u201chooked\u201d edge along the bottom to keep the drawer from slipping off the cabinet rail. The rails along the opposite side of the drawer and cabinet do not have these \u201chooked\u201d edges. If the right and left rails are not parallel, then this is when the drawer is likely to drop off the track along that edge. You can usually feel this occur as you close the drawer. You are also likely to feel a temporary bind and a \u201cpop\u201d of the wheel back onto the track as you open the drawer. Check the position of your rails and wheels. With the drawer fully closed, use a flashlight to look at the drawer rails and cabinet rails from inside the cabinet and below the drawers. If the drawer has jumped the track, the drawer glide wheel along the \u201cnon-hooked\u201d edge will be off or nearly off the track. Adjust a minor derailment. You can make the adjustment by loosening the mounting screws along on the cabinet rail mounting bracket at the inside rear of the cabinet. Nudge the bracket inward until the glide wheel on the drawer is properly traveling along cabinet rail. Then, secure it in place by tightening the bracket screws. Fix a drawer rail that jumps off as the drawer is closed. If the drawer rail jumps off the guide wheel at the face frame as the drawer is closed, then you have to use the following trick to realign the rail. Remove the mounting screw that holds the rail to the face frame of the cabinet. Take one or more of the \u00be\u201d washers and use as spacers between the face frame and the rail. You can gage the number of washers you will need by comparing the thickness of a number of washers \twith how much the rail needs to be moved. Align the washers with the hole where the screw will be replaced. Since \t\t\tyou have now increased the space between the rail and the face frame, you \t\twill need to use one of the longer screws described at the beginning of the \t\t\ttutorial. Your drawer should now open and close without jumping the track! Use this same trick if the cabinet glides are mounted to wood rails that run from front to back. You may use washers to adjust the back end of the glide as you did the face frame end of the glide. Fixing a Glide Wheel That Lifts Off The Rail Fix a wheel that lifts off. Fixing a glide wheel that lifts of the rail when the drawer is closed requires a different solution than fixing a wheel that \u201cjumps\u201d the track. This scenario is when the wheel lifts straight up off the track surface at either the front or back of the drawer. This, too, is an easy adjustment. Loosen the mounting screw. If the wheel lifts off the track at the back of the drawer, simply loosen the mounting screw on the rail or the mounting bracket. Then, slightly raise the rail until the wheel rides properly on the track. Be sure not to raise it too much, or the opposite wheel will lift off its track. Make any necessary small adjustments to align support wheel. If the drawer glide lifts from the support wheel on the rail at the face frame, this will require a small adjustment. However, the adjustment will be made at the rear end of the rail and not at the face frame. Raise the right cabinet glide rail if the left drawer glide is lifted off the support wheel. Raising the cabinet glide at the opposite corner will lower the drawer glide back onto the support wheel at the face frame. Here is the \u201cformula\u201d to keep in mind: Raising right rear lowers left front; raising left rear lowers right front! Think in opposites! When using washers or any other material for spacers, either run the mounting screws through the spacers or have two equal-size spacers \u201cstraddle\u201d the mounting screws to avoid distorting the shape of the glide rail. Distortion and twisting can cause binding\u2014and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to adjust!",
