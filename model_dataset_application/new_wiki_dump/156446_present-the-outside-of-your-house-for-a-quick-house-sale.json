Jobs to consider if needed:\nRepaint in a conservative colour (black, blue, white, red or green). Polish all knobs and knockers or replace if dated. Make sure your doorbell works and doesn\u2019t look like it could give an electric shock."

Scrub away any build-up of moss around drains (a sure sign to surveyors that there is a drainage problem to tell the buyer\u2019s mortgage lender about).
