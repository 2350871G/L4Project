When the milk gets warm, add the grated cheese and salt. Stir the mixture until the cheese has melted, then remove it from heat. The mixture should be thick and viscous. If it seems too runny, add another tablespoon of flour. You can add 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper to take the spice level up another notch."
