  "text":" Make the Stuffing Fry the hamburger, drain it, and set it aside. Also, set aside the grease. You will be using some of it in the sauce. Quickly fry the onions and garlic. If you want, you can cook them with the hamburger. Steam the cabbage (or at least slightly boil).  Make the rice. Here, beef bouillon is being used in the water for extra flavor. If you want a little flavor, add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of salsa to the water for the rice. Dress the rice anyway you like. After the cabbage is partially cooked, remove it from the water. This is what you will roll the rolls in. Set aside the water. Mix the hamburger, onions, and two cups of the rice together. If you have any left over, you can use it for a side. Stir in a couple of eggs. If you are trying to reduce your egg intake, feel free to reduce it by one. Add about 2 tablespoons of the 'sour cream'. Feel free to add more (or less) depending on how much you like it. Add 2 tablespoons of the salsa to this mixture as well.  Be sure to mix everything thoroughly.  Start rolling the meat mixture into the cabbage leaves. Use toothpicks and 'baste' them together so they will stay closed. Continue to do this until you have finished with the meat mixture. If you run out of cabbage leaves, use corn tortillas. Make the Sauce Turn your heat to about 3/4 strength. Have a medium sized saucepan (use the one that you cooked the cabbage in and save yourself dishes). Heat 1/4 cup of the water that you used for the cabbage. You could use fresh water, but this is healthier because there are nutrients in the water from the cabbage. If you cooked a purple cabbage, it will be a beautiful shade of purple! Add 1 cup of sour cream to the water and mix. With the whisk, start stirring it until it is hot. Stir until well blended and hot, but not at a simmer yet.  Whisk in the egg. Do this quickly or it will be scrambled egg in sour cream. Add the spices. This is purely a matter of taste. Read the tips below for some information about adding the spices. Add about 3 tablespoons of the leftover grease, and add it to the sauce.  Still keeping it hot and stirring together, add the salsa.
