Raymond Chiu\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Director of Operations, Maid Sailors\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: You can also use baking soda to clean the dishwasher by hand. Remove any parts of the interior that will come out easily, such as the rack and the filter. Create a paste of baking soda and water, then apply it to a microfiber rag or a soft-bristled brush. Scrub the interior of the dishwasher gently in a circular motion, then clean all of the parts you took out. Rinse the parts in warm water, then run a short hot-water cycle to rinse the inside of the machine."
