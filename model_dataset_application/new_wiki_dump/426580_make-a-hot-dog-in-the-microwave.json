If you're cooking multiple hot dogs, line them up in a row on the towel, leaving a little space between each. This allows them to cook evenly. Be sure to use a microwave-safe plate.

This allows steam from inside the hot dog to escape rather than building up and causing it to explode. However, some sources (like Oscar Mayer) claim that there is no danger of explosion and that piercing the hot dogs will let the juices run out while they cook, leaving you with a dry frank. The choice here is yours \u2014 if you're only microwaving one or two hot dogs, they'll be in the microwave for such little time that you're unlikely to run into problems either way."

Wrap the bun in the paper towel or place a second on top. Microwave on high for 10-15 seconds. Check for a warm, soft texture. If it's not quite warm yet, go an additional 10 seconds.
