Sweet corn is most commonly used in home gardens. Standard sweet corn (labeled as 'su' on seed packets) is the most mild of the sweet corns. Over 50% of the sugar contained in standard sweet corn is converted to starch within 24 hours of being picked, so it must be consumed or canned soon after being harvested. Sugar enhanced sweet corn (labeled as 'se' on seed packets) is genetically modified to slow the sugar to starch conversion rate, increasing the sweetness and tenderness of the kernels. Super sweet corn (labeled as 'sh2' on seed packets) is the sweetest variety available. It's kernels are slightly smaller than other sweet corn varieties, and shrivel when dried."
