          "description":"Transfer the milk to a large Dutch oven that can hold at least 3 quarts (2.8 L). Heat the milk over medium-high heat, stirring regularly to prevent the bottom from burning. Insert a candy thermometer into the milk and bring the milk to a full simmer, which is around 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C). Heating the milk to an almost boil will help the yogurt set, rather than form separated curds and whey. You can use any milk you like for this recipe, including non-dairy milks such as soy or coconut. You can also use dairy milk. Whole milk or 2 percent will produce a creamier yogurt, but you can use skim or 1 percent as well."

          "description":"Once the milk reaches 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C), remove it from the heat and set it aside to cool to between 112 and 115 \u00b0F (44 and 46 \u00b0C). This is the ideal temperature for adding and growing the bacterial cultures that will convert the milk into yogurt. Stir regularly as the milk cools to help it cool faster and prevent a skin from forming. Cooling the milk to this temperature may take up to an hour."

          "headline":"Turn on the light in your oven.",
          "description":"To make yogurt, you have to keep the milk and bacterial cultures that you\u2019ll add later at around 110 \u00b0F (43 \u00b0C) for several hours. This is around the temperature your oven gets when you turn the light on but leave the heat off, so you can incubate the yogurt in the oven. Remove the middle rack to make room for the Dutch oven. Instead of incubating the yogurt in the oven, you can also use a yogurt maker or dehydrator to incubate the yogurt. If you don\u2019t have either of these appliances, you can transfer the yogurt to a thermos to keep it warm."

          "description":"When the milk reaches the right temperature, remove a cup (235 ml) from the Dutch oven and transfer it to a small bowl. Add the commercial yogurt and whisk the mixture to fully incorporate the milk and yogurt. Use a commercial yogurt that contains active cultures, because the cultures in the yogurt will start your new batch. The yogurt container label will specify if it contains active cultures. Instead of commercial yogurt, you can also use freeze-dried yogurt starter. Read the instructions on the package for the exact measurements and directions. Typically, you'll stir \u215b teaspoon of yogurt starter powder it into the warm milk. Reseal the yogurt starter and return it to the freezer."

The bacteria need to remain between 110 and 115 \u00b0F (43 and 46 \u00b0C) in order to turn the milk into yogurt, and wrapping the Dutch oven with a towel will help keep them warm and at a constant temperature. If you're using a yogurt maker or dehydrator instead, transfer the milk to individual yogurt or mason jars."

After 4 hours, carefully remove the Dutch oven and check the yogurt to see if it has set. If the yogurt hasn\u2019t thickened to your liking, place it back in the oven for another 1 to 4 hours, until it reaches your desired consistency. Typically, the yogurt should have the consistency of custard. As the yogurt incubates, it will continue to become thicker and tarter."
