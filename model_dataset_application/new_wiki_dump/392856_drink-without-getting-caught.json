If the coffee cup is Styrofoam or unclear plastic, you can use it to conceal virtually any type of alcohol as the liquid will not be visible through the cup. A clear plastic cup can still be useful. Red wine looks like coffee and you can also mix a dark liquid, like soda or pomegranate juice, with a liquor of your choice. You can also simply spike your coffee."

Coffee has a strong scent that covers the smell of most alcohol. Adding a dash of liquor to a cup of a coffee is unlikely to cause too much smell. Choose a peppermint flavored drink, like peppermint hot cocoa or tea. Peppermint gives off a strong scent that usually overpowers alcohol. Around the holiday season, non-alcoholic drinks made with flavors like cinnamon, nutmeg, and other strong, earthy scents are easy to spike without getting caught. Much like peppermint, these smells are hard to detect."

If you're using a flask to conceal alcohol, drink when others are not around. Sneak off to a private location to steal a drink. If you're hiding alcohol in something like a coffee container, drink as you normally would. Keep the container in which you're hiding alcohol away from others. If they take a sip or smell the alcohol, you'll end up getting caught. If someone asks to try your drink, make up an excuse. Claim you have a cold or flu and do not want to infect them."
