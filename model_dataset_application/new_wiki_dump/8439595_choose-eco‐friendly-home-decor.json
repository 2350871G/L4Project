          "description":"If you\u2019re concerned about the environment, treat plastic as your #1 enemy. Whether you\u2019re looking for a new lamp, flooring, or furniture, scratch any products made from this material off your list. Expect plastic to have wide-ranging consequences on the environment. For instance:\nThe chemicals in plastic are poisonous to wildlife. This is a particular threat to marine life, which are more likely to ingest plastic. Plastic debris in oceans and waterways provides transport for both plants and animals. This can introduce invasive species to new environments with devastating results. Plastic can endure for centuries or even millennia with prolonged negative effects on the environment. Nearly 10% of all oil production is devoted to the manufacturing of plastics."

          "description":"Any time that you use fabric to touch up your home decor (such as with curtains, bedding, throw pillows, or rugs), check which materials are used. Expect some fabrics to be non-biodegradable. Additionally, be aware that some are highly consumptive of energy during production and/or otherwise harmful to the environment in less obvious ways (such as utilizing pesticides during production). Fabrics with negative impacts on the environment include non-organic cotton, nylon, polyester, rayon, and non-organic wool. Sustainable fabrics include bamboo, organic cotton, hemp, linen, and organic wool. Also be aware that dyes, bleach, and formaldehyde are often used in the production of fabrics, which should also be avoided."

          "description":"Whenever you purchase new home decor, consider both the before and after for each product. Choose materials that cause minimal negative impact on the environment both in terms of production and future impact, like wood, metal, and glass. Whether you\u2019re looking to paint a room, carpet a floor, or just buy a picture frame, research your options and become an informed consumer. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provides an extensive guide to eco-friendly choices for your home at https://www.epa.gov/greenerproducts/identify-greener-products-and-services. Recycled materials (such as plastic lumber) are also a popular choice, since they often use relatively little energy to make without bringing any new harmful materials into existence."

          "headline":"Shop for durability.",
          "description":"Whether you\u2019re picking out new furniture, redoing your floors, or painting your bedroom room a new color, think long-term. Recognize that constantly updating or replacing your decor will have negative consequences on the environment, even if you\u2019re using eco-friendly materials. Avoid impulse shopping or immediately going with what seems like the cheapest option. Instead, make choices that will satisfy your tastes for years to come and invest in decor that will last a long time. For example:\nSay you want a new armchair, but your current budget is limited. Although you may be tempted to go with the cheapest option available, wait it out and save more money for a future purchase, since a cheaply constructed chair will likely break down in a shorter amount of time. This will increase your footprint with physical waste plus more energy consumption through production and transportation."

          "headline":"Shop locally.",
          "description":"Between globalization and online shopping, the marketplace for decor is as wide as the world. However, keep in mind that the farther a product has to travel, the larger your footprint is due to the energy consumed during transportation. Although there may be great deals out there from far-flung sources, prioritize local ones to minimize the amount of pollution and lost resources that transportation causes. Apply this mindset not only to local vendors, but their sources as well. For instance:\nIf you\u2019re buying new wooden flooring from a store just down the street, the amount of distance your flooring has to travel from store to home is next to nil. However, if the store gets their timber from half a world away, shopping at a store one town over may be preferable if they get their timber from sources closer to home."

          "headline":"Favor used products.",
          "description":"Remember that even with sustainable materials, the act of production creates pollution and uses up finite resources. Reduce your contribution to this unfortunate effect by using secondhand items to furnish and decorate your home. Visit thrift stores, yard sales, and flea markets. Utilize the internet to find items for sale (or even freebies) through social media and online classifieds. Ask friends, family, and neighbors to let you know when they plan on getting rid of any items that you might want or need. Don\u2019t let pride get in the way. Keep your eyes peeled for items being tossed out with other people\u2019s garbage. Find out your sanitation department\u2019s schedules for bulk pick-up in your area and go cruising. If you live near a college town, take advantage of the fact that many rental leases expire at the same time of year, which means the streets may be lined with discarded furniture and items."

There is no limit to the DIY projects that can transform one object into another. You can do anything from:\nMake a new ottoman out of a plastic milk crate. Transform empty tea, cookie, or popcorn tins as flower pots, pencil jars, candleholders, or umbrella stands. Use an old door as a tabletop for a new coffee table."

Use these to combat toxic pollutants like formaldehyde that items like cleaning products and furniture components can introduce to your home. In addition to live plants, consider other natural materials that can be incorporated into eye-catching decorations, like:\nPinecones\nStones\nAntlers\nDriftwood"

Remember that even your toxic-free paint will still create pollution and use up resources through production and transportation. So, when deciding which color to paint a room, consider how much sunlight that rooms receive. Even if you have your heart set on a dark color, go with a lighter shade if it receives a lot. This way any fading will be less noticeable, which means each paint job will last longer."

If privacy is a concern, use other home decor to maximize the natural light while partially blocking the sun with sheer or wooden blinds.

With fixtures, install or keep as many as you need in order to see comfortably, but seek out ways to avoid excessive lighting. For example:\nIf your ceiling fan holds four or five light bulbs, but only two or three are needed to light the space, remove the unnecessary ones. Give yourself some options by, say, providing a table- or standing lamp in a room with track lighting so you can alternate between the two depending on your needs.

If this isn\u2019t possible, caulk your windows and add weather-stripping to reduce leakage. Add storm windows for additional insulation. Keep the temperature inside your home as consistent as possible to minimize active use of your heating and a/c units. Give your windows extra help by choosing thermal-backed curtains and blinds. Although this may contradict the tip about keeping curtains open for sunlight, keep them closed for more insulation during extreme temperatures, since your heating and cooling units use more energy than a couple light bulbs."
