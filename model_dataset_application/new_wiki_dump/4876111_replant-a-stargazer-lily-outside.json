          "description":"If you've moved your Stargazer lily indoors to protect it over the winter months, you should think about replanting it outside once the frosts and heavy rainfall are over. This is likely to be in mid-spring. Try to prepare the ground well ahead of time by applying plenty of organic matter (such as manure) to the soil in order to improve drainage. You should start doing this over the winter, well before you replant your Stargazer lilies in the spring. If you apply fresh manure too close to planting there\u2019s always a risk of \u2018scorching\u2019 the plant tissue, so avoid this if possible."

Cover the bulbs with soil, water well and apply a layer of mulch to a depth of about 2 inches (5.1 cm). Stargazer lilies should be spaced about 10 inches (25.4 cm) apart."

Lift the bulbs without damaging them and try to keep as much of the root intact as possible. Wash the bulb off under lukewarm water. It\u2019s also a good idea to apply a fungicidal powder (available at any garden supply store). Apply the fungicidal powder according the the instructions on the packaging."
