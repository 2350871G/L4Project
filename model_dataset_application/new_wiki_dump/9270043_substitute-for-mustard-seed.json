  "text":" Substituting with Other Ingredients Use prepared horseradish to add spice. Prepared horseradish is made by combining ground horseradish with vinegar, and sometimes other spices, to form a sauce. You can get it from your local supermarket. In place of mustard seed, use the same amount of prepared horseradish to add spice and complexity to your recipe. Add mayonnaise to achieve the same consistency. Mustard seeds are often used to thicken soups or other dishes. If you need mustard seeds to change the consistency of a dish, substitute the seeds for the same amount of mayonnaise. Substitute wasabi to increase the heat. Wasabi is a spicy green paste used in many Asian dishes. If you don\u2019t have mustard seed, substitute it with a smaller amount of wasabi to add heat to your dish. Use caraway seeds for a similar flavor. Substitute the same quantity of caraway seeds for mustard seeds in your recipe.

Using Different Kinds of Mustard Substitute the same amount of dry mustard for mustard seeds. If your recipe calls for 1 Tbsp (14.3 g) of mustard seeds, simply substitute it for 1 Tbsp (14.3 g) of dry mustard. Use 1 tsp of prepared mustard instead of 1 Tbsp of mustard seeds. If possible, decrease the amount of liquid in the recipe by 1 tsp (5 mL) to compensate for this substitution. For other quantities, use one-third of the amount of prepared mustard in place of mustard seed. Replace white mustard seeds with fewer brown or black mustard seeds. Brown and black mustard seeds are more potent than white (also called yellow) mustard seeds.
