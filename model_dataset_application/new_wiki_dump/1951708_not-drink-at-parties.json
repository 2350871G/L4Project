However, it can be helpful to remind those who care about you that this is your preference and that you'd appreciate both their support and their respect for your decision.

Tell a friend at the party or before you are not going to drink and make it clear why and get their moral support. It is good to discuss before a party with good friends why you cannot drink so they understand and appreciate your point of view. It's also helpful to let the host know ahead of time too. This allows for understanding and also gives the host a chance to get more non-alcoholic drinks (or you can offer to bring them)."
