The first player to 15 points and has at least a 2 point lead is declared the winner. In the event that the first player to reach 15 points does not have at least a 2 point lead, the winner is determined by the same tie-breaking method in Tennis of \"Deuce\". During this tie-breaker, the same rules of game-play are still in effect. Both players begin at Deuce. If a player scores a point, they move to the status of \"Advantage\". If they score once more they will be declared the winner. However, if the other player scores, both scores return to Deuce. This method is followed until a player is effectively determined as having scored twice on the opponent with no opposing points being scored."

  "text":" Setting Up the Game Go to a local restaurant that serves food in a basket (the Pan) (preferably not plastic, but it is still usable), with paper and foil linings. Each player needs his or her own Pan. Eat your food, leaving no remnants in the paper or foil.  Make a Ball out of either the foil or the paper, depending on preference. Wrap the other sheet of material around the Ball. The Foil is intended to give weight to the ball while the paper is intended to cushion the rough surface of the aluminum foil. Sit across the table from your opponent, preferably two to three feet apart.  The Face-Off Lay both Pans flat face-up on the table, with the ball equidistant between the two Pans.  Each player grasps their Pan based completely on player preference.  An observer yells \"Go\" and the two players both flip their Pans as fast as possible, trying to cover the Ball first.  The player who covers the Ball fastest gains possession of the Ball and takes the Ball into his/her Pan.  If the Ball is pushed off the table while the players try to cover the Ball, then the face-off is replayed.
