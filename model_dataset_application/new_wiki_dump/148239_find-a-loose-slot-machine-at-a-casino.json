The payout table is a small printed sticker displaying the percentages of likelihood for the winning combinations. If you don\u2019t want to pay the maximum, consider finding a less expensive slot machine. For example, if you play on a machine with a 25 cent minimum but a one dollar maximum, you should play with one dollar to see the best results. This technique is best for machines with a jackpot. However, this is a good method for regular slot machines as well."

          "description":"Whenever you sit down to a new machine you need to test the payout percentage. Put in a few dollars and see how much you get back. After some time has passed, figure out whether or not you\u2019re breaking even. If you are, stay put! It could be a loose slot machine! If not, move to another machine. For example, if you spend about twenty dollars at a machine over half an hour and only get about ten dollars back, that\u2019s probably not a loose machine. Leave and find a better one. Avoid choosing a \u201cfavorite machine.\u201d If you devote a lot of attention to one particular machine, you won\u2019t be as likely to leave it when it stops paying out."

This is based off of the belief that loose machines are situated right next to tight machines. These gamblers believe that increasing the number of machines they use increases their chance to find a loose slot. Don\u2019t spread yourself too thin. If you use machines that are too far away from one another, you may lose track of which machines you\u2019re gambling with.
