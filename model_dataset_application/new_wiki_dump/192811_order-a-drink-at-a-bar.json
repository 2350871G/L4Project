Beer bars can also be called taverns, breweries, and craft beer bars. If you\u2019re not sure what kind of beer you like, talk to the bartender for a recommendation or ask for a beer sample. Lagers are the most common beers. They are generally a golden color. Wheat beers are lighter colored beers with a crisp yeast flavor. Ales range in color from light brown to black. These beers have a deep, mellow flavor. IPAs (India Pale Ales) are golden beers with a hoppy, floral flavor. Porters are dark, foamy beers with a roasted malty flavor."

Sauvignon Blanc is a mid-bodied white wine, often with tart citrus notes. Chardonnay is a somewhat denser white wine with apple, light citrus, often creamy/buttery notes. Pinot Noir is a red wine with complex red fruit flavors and often an earthy undertone. Merlot is a red wine with jammy fruit and baking spice notes. Cabernet Sauvignon is a denser, often tannic, red wine with dark fruit notes."

Martinis are a classic choice. These strongly flavored drinks can be ordered with or without olives, shaken over ice, or stirred. A Jack Rose is a mellow, pink drink made with sweet apple brandy. Order a Bourbon Sweet Tea for a refreshing, boozy drink. If you want a sweet drink, order a velvety Chocolate Martini."
