It is not possible to find areas where you can save if you do not have a clear picture of exactly what you are spending your money on. Carry a little ledger or notebook around with you and jot down every penny that you spend. While it is obvious to include expenses such as rent, utilities, groceries and gasoline, you must also include all small amounts such as morning coffee, lunch take-out, snacks or lottery tickets."

      "description":"Here is the part where you need to identify your \u201cneeds\u201d vs your \u201cwants\u201d. Are all of those coffees from the vending machine at work really a \u201cneed\u201d? Do you need to get a take-out lunch every day or can you really bring lunch from home at a fraction of the cost? You may think that these are simply small amounts, but if you keep in mind that pennies count too, you will actually see that these small expenses add up quite fast and quite significantly by the end of the month. Saving yourself only $5 each work day in unnecessary snacks will add up to $110 a month or $1,300 a year!"

      "description":"Many people spend much more than they plan to on their grocery bill. In many instances you will find it difficult to understand just how you managed to spend so much. It is important to become a wise shopper. There are a number of points you should follow:\nPlan a weekly menu so you know what ingredients you need. Make a shopping list. Avoid impulse buys and stick to your list. Do not be tempted by specials on food items that are not necessary. Buy fewer processed foods and more whole foods, as healthy foods are better for you."

Electricity \u2013 use it only when you need it.
