Put it in a container that is at least 1 foot (0.3 m) in diameter and 1 \u00bd to 2 feet (0.6 m) deep to give the peony plenty of room to grow. Larger varieties will require an even larger pot. The container must also have several drain holes in the bottom. Gardeners should also note that these plants respond badly to being transplanted and should start out their lives in large containers. Therefore, a 5 gallon (18.9 L) size pot is ideal for peonies."
