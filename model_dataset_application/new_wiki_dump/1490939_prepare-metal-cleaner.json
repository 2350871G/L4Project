  "text":" Steps Mix a bucket full of neutral cleaner. These are available in most supermarket aisles. Look for a cleaner that says it has a PH-balanced cleanser, meaning it is not alkaline or acidic and will not damage what it cleans. These cleansers should be mixed in cold or lukewarm water, as hot water can disperse the chemical agents. When you clean some types of metal, you will need to finish by cleaning it with a neutral cleanser that will wipe away chemicals. Clean your silver with your mild PH balanced cleanser. This will rid it of any dust or grime before removing the tarnish made up of silver sulfide. Rinse the silver with water. Cover the inside of a pot with aluminum foil. The size of the pot depends upon the size of the silver you are cleaning. Use a small saucepan for jewelry or a large pot for silverware or larger fittings. Pour enough water in to cover your piece of silver. Pour in 1 to 2 cups (205 to 411 g) of baking soda for each gallon of water you use. If you are using a small saucepan, 1 to 2 tbsp. (13 to 26 g) should suffice. Bring the water to a boil. Remove the pot from the heat. Add the tarnished silver with tongs. Wait 3 to 5 minutes. You should see the aluminum foil start to turn black. Sulfide is more attracted to the foil and will transfer with the help of baking soda. Move the silver piece around with your tongs to ensure as much as possible has touched the aluminum foil. Remove the silver, rinse with water and polish with a soft cloth. Aluminum Cleaner Scrub the aluminum with your PH-balanced cleanser to remove food, dust, dirt and grime. Most aluminum is actually aluminum alloy because aluminum itself is very soft. Keep this in mind when cleaning and avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive sponges, since you don't know which alloy is used. Mix a solution of water and 2 tbsp. (29 ml) of vinegar, lemon juice or cream of tartar for small pieces of aluminum or aluminum cookware. For larger pieces, double or triple the amount and place aluminum inside a large pot. Bring to a boil and let it boil for 15 minutes. You can place many aluminum pieces inside the pot at the same time. Wash with your neutral cleanser, rinse well and dry.  Stainless Steel Cleaner Clean stainless steel once a week, if possible. Stainless steel does stain and spot so it is good to keep on top of it. There are a few different methods to cleaning stainless steel. Pour warm water over a soft cloth and rub the surface of the steel. Use a small amount of neutral cleaner if you feel it requires more. Rinse and dry by hand to avoid spots. Remove grease with rubbing alcohol on a soft cloth. Remove burnt stains with a paste of baking soda and water. Always rinse and dry by hand. Grease Remover Remove grease with a butyl-based cleaner. These cleaners often have the word \"purple\" in them because of the cleaner's color. Buy a bottle that has a trigger, rather than an aerosol can. It will be safer and easier to control. Wear thick protective gloves and glasses. Work in a ventilated area. Butyl is a harsh chemical derived from butane. Use a solution of 10 percent butyl to 90 percent water for light cleaning jobs. Use a solution of 50 percent butyl and 50 percent water for heavy degreasing. Pour the solution into a spray bottle if it isn't in a bottle already. Spray the solution into a cloth and rub it on the grease. If it's a very difficult job, spray the butyl solution directly on the metal. Rub the grease away. Clean immediately after the grease is removed with your PH-balanced cleanser.  Call your local waste disposal company to see where you can safely dispose of butyl product. ",
