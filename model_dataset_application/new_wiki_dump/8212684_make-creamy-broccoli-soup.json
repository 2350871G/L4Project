Chop the broccoli florets and the tender, small stalks. Set the chopped broccoli aside. You should end up with about 4 cups (700 g) of chopped broccoli."

The onion should become translucent. Avoid overcooking the onion to the point that it becomes caramelized or crispy."

They should be soft enough to puree in a blender or with a handheld blender until the soup becomes smooth. If you want to puree the soup in the blender, carefully ladle the hot soup into the blender and puree it in batches."

Ensure that the soup doesn't return to a boil since this will make the heavy cream separate. Add salt and pepper to taste. To make this recipe vegan, leave out the cream and use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock."

Add these to the pot of melted butter. Saute the onion and garlic for 3 to 5 minutes. The onion should be tender and almost translucent. The garlic should be fragrant."

Slowly whisk in 1 cup (240 ml) of half-and-half until the mixture is smooth. You'll need to stir or whisk the roux constantly to avoid lumps. If you do end up with a few lumps, don't worry since you'll be pureeing the soup."

Once the soup begins to bubble, reduce the heat to medium-low so that it's simmering. Simmer the soup for about 10 minutes. Keep the soup uncovered as it cooks and stir it occasionally to keep the soup from sticking to the pot."

You'll also need to peel and dice 1 large carrot or two carrots, if they're small. Add the chopped vegetables to the soup and simmer the soup for 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the soup at this point and add salt and pepper. You can also take out the bay leaf."

          "headline":"Puree the soup and add the cheese.",
          "description":"Puree the soup using a blender or handheld immersion blender. Make the soup as smooth as you like. Pour the soup back into the pot on the stove and add 8 ounces (about 2 1/2 cups) of coarsely grated sharp cheddar cheese. Whisk the cheese in till it melts. Since the broccoli should be completely tender, you can leave some chunks for a more textured soup."
