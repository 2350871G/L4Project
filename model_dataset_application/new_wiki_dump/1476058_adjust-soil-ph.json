This will give you some clues about what altering the soil may entail. Because of this, you should understand your soil type early. Well-drained and loose soil will be more easily altered. On the other hand, compacted soil that has a lot of clay in it will be difficult to change. Determining your soil type will help you figure out the best method for applying any materials to it."

Soil pH is determined on a scale from zero to 14, with seven being a neutral pH that is neither acidic nor alkaline. Anything over seven is alkaline and anything below seven is acidic. Most plants prefer a pH between six and seven and a half, as do earthworms and microorganisms, which help your plants."

Many plants prefer a more acidic soil, particularly flowers and some fruit plants like blueberries. Research what the recommended pH levels are for the plants you want to grow. Azaleas, rhododendrons, blueberries and conifers like acidic soils (pH 5.0 to 5.5)\nVegetables, grasses and most ornamentals prefer slightly acidic soils (pH 5.8 to 6.5)"

You can buy a commercial test at a local home and garden store or send a sample to a company that will test it for you. The easiest way to test your soil is to dig a hole, fill it with water and then insert a test probe into muddy water. However, sending a soil sample to be tested will give you a more accurate indication of your soil\u2019s pH\nThere are also some DIY methods that include making your own pH test strips."

If you mostly water your garden or yard with water from a faucet, your soil may be more alkaline. You can use commercial pH test strips or an electronic pH meter."

          "description":"If you have tested your soil and found that it is too acidic, you can raise the pH by adding a base. The most common materials used to increase the pH of soil are compounds made from powdered limestone, or lime, which you can find at most home and garden store. Standard lime comes in four types: pulverized, hydrated, granules and pellets. Depending on your soil type and the amount of moisture in the ground, one of these compounds may be a good option. Pulverized lime is finely ground and more easily absorbed by the soil. However, it is more difficult to spread because it can clog the applicator. Granular and pelletized lime are easier to spread. However, it is not as effective at altering the soil pH. Hydrated lime should only be used with extremely acidic soils since it is more water-soluble and can quickly increase a soil\u2019s pH. Some lime sources contain micronutrients like dolomite, which is a mixture of calcium and magnesium carbonates. However, you should only use dolomitic lime if your soil is magnesium deficient. Do not add more magnesium to soils that are already high in it."

However, it can dramatically increase a soil\u2019s pH over time. Because of this, you should monitor the soil closely as you apply wood ash. Keep the ash from coming into contact with any plant roots or germinating seedlings because it may damage them. Wood ash works well in sandy soil."

The lime should be tilled into the soil\u2019s the root zone or the top 7 inches (18 cm) of soil. You can apply the lime by hand if you have a small enough piece of land. You can also use a spreader to apply liming material to a yard. You can use a rake or a rototiller to work the liming material into the soil. Because lime is not very water-soluble, tilling it into the soil will maximize its effect."

Use a garden hose or sprinkler to apply water. How often you water the soil depends on the size of the plot of land and the amount of moisture already in the soil. Too much watering can leech other minerals out of the soil."
