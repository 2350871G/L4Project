If you are planning to move your furniture over carpet or grass you should buy sliders that specialize in that movement. If you don\u2019t have any sliders you can also try using Frisbees."

          "headline":"Push the furniture.",
          "description":"Once you have the sliders under the corners of the furniture you can begin to push it. Having another person would be helpful to ensure that the furniture does not tip. Push the furniture from a lower section rather than the top to minimize the risk of tipping. The friction is almost eliminated with sliders and the furniture should move very easily."

They help you utilize your stronger muscle groups while also giving you added leverage. You can buy a shoulder dolly online. Shoulder dollies are not recommended for moving furniture up or down stairs \u2013 the weight will shift almost completely to the person on the bottom."

          "headline":"Use moving blankets.",
          "description":"Instead of sliders, you can also use the moving blankets that are generally used to keep furniture safe during a move. Moving blankets work in a similar way to sliders, although you will put the entire blanket under the piece of furniture. Once the entire blanket is under the furniture you can start pulling the blanket in the direction you want to move. The furniture should slide along with it. This is much easier than trying to lift the whole thing. If you need to move heavy furniture upstairs you can fold up a bunch of moving blankets and place them on each step to turn your stairs into a makeshift ramp. Once you\u2019ve done that you can place another blanket under the piece of furniture and pull the edge to move the furniture up the steps. If your steps are particularly steep it would be a good idea to have a friend steady the back of the furniture."

          "headline":"Use a moving dolly.",
          "description":"A hand truck or a square moving dolly could be good options depending on the type of furniture you\u2019re moving. A hand truck is a piece of metal moving equipment that stands upright with wheels on the bottom. The handle is at the top and a platform to hold the furniture is at the bottom by the wheels. Moving dollies are small square platforms with four wheels. You can find moving dolly\u2019s of all different sizes. Use a hand truck to move furniture by wheeling the platform under the piece of furniture you\u2019re trying to move. A hand truck will work well for smaller bookcases, tables, and dressers. Lean the furniture against the hand truck and tilt the handle toward you. The furniture will lean with the hand truck and you\u2019ll be able to wheel it around. This is much easier than pushing it. Be very careful with hand trucks. If you try to move a piece of furniture that is too large it could fall and crush you. Your strength will be keeping the furniture upright. Moving dollies are very easy to use. All you need to do is place the furniture on top of them and then you\u2019ll be able to use the dolly's wheels to push it around. Make sure you find a dolly that is large enough for the piece of furniture you plan to move. Having a friend to help you pick up the furniture would make the process of getting it on the dolly easier."

          "headline":"Place a glossy magazine under the corners.",
          "description":"Glossy magazines can help reduce friction with the floor and allow you to drag the entire piece of furniture. You won\u2019t damage the floor and you won\u2019t feel the weight of the furniture nearly as much. However, you will probably destroy the magazine. Having someone to help you lift up each corner of the furniture while you place the magazines would make the process much easier. You can also try placing the magazines on the floor, lifting the corners by yourself, and then pushing the magazine under the corner using your foot."

Tilt the furniture backward so that one person carries the top of it while the other side stays low and the second person carries the bottom. Maintain this angle as you move. This way you don\u2019t have to lift the furniture all the way back up when you are ready to set it upright. It will also fit the angle of stairs more easily."

Moving heavy furniture is difficult enough as it is without having to maneuver your way through doors with trial and error. Move the back of the chair through the doorway or corner first and then curl around the door frame to get it through easily. If you\u2019re confused about how to bend from your hips, start by squatting. Pick up the furniture from the squatting position using your legs to propel you upward."

If the table can be broken up into separate sections then move each section one by one. Separating a piece of furniture into component parts is always a good tactic. Remove each drawer from your dresser prior to moving it. That way you can transport the drawers individually and then come back for the dresser itself."
