Stay away from more slow, dreary music, as this can make you feel tired and bored.Tip: If you don\u2019t know what to listen to, search for an upbeat playlist online. Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora have a range of great cleaning and motivational playlists."

Maybe you will go hang out with your friends, watch a movie with your family, eat a big bowl of ice cream, or read your favorite book. Make sure not to rush your cleaning in order to get your reward!"

See how many things you can put away during 10 minutes and then try to beat your high score. Alternatively, pretend that you are a robot while you are cleaning and only make robot movements and noises. Another option is to set a timer and see how fast you can clean your room. Tip: Start the dusting from top surfaces to the bottom so that this sequence will help you get the job done in less time and without repeating the same job. Be creative and create your own games!"

Using your space as a display area will help you keep the room tidier since objects that don\u2019t belong will look out of place and you\u2019ll be encouraged to put them away.

Always start high and work your way down, so that you don\u2019t knock dust and dirt onto surfaces you\u2019ve already cleaned. Dust before you vacuum or sweep because dust will often become displaced and then settle back on your floor. If you don\u2019t have a duster, use a microfiber cloth to remove the dust.

Microfiber cloths are a great option, as they easily remove a variety of different marks.
