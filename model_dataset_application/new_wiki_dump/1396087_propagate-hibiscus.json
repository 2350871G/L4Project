          "description":"Take cuttings in the middle of summer when hibiscuses experience the most growth. This will give you a better chance of successfully propagating all of the cuttings. If you wait until the late summer, the stems will be more mature and woody, and they might take longer to root."

          "description":"At the ends of the branches, look for stems that are smooth and dark green with plenty of leaves. A healthy hibiscus will have plenty of new growth to choose from. It's okay to take cuttings from stems that are slightly brown or darker green, but they must be rooted in topsoil to be successful."

          "description":"Using sharp, clean pruning shears, cut the green branches away from the plant at lengths of 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm). Carefully collect them in a box or bag for safekeeping while you work. Avoid taking too many cuttings from one plant, as this can cause the parent plant to look bare or stop growing altogether. Aim to take no more than 5-6 cuttings at one time. After taking the cuttings, wipe the pruning shears with a clean, damp cloth to remove any bacteria and prevent rusting."

          "description":"Removing leaves from the cuttings helps to improve oxygen levels as the plants are growing. Gently snip all of the leaves off with the pruning shears, leaving only 2-3 leaves at the very top of the stem. If the remaining leaves are very large, cut them in half horizontally to avoid wilting. You should never pull leaves off of the cuttings, as this can cause damage to the fibers in the stem, making growth more difficult."

If possible, make the cut through an area where a leaf was growing from the stem. These spots, called \u201ceyes\u201d contain natural growth hormones."

There are a plethora of different kinds of rooting hormones available, but many gardeners like to use honey. Carefully coat the end of the stem and transfer the stem to the rooting medium. Try to avoid touching the end of the cutting with your hands, as they can transfer oils onto the stem that prevent the rooting hormone from working."

Fill a clear bottle with 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of warm water, and add a drop of hydrogen peroxide. Carefully place the cuttings into the bottle, making sure that the leaves don't touch the water. Remember to change the water out once per week. Simply remove the cutting from the water, pour out the water, and replace it with new water to prevent microbes from forming. Using this method, you'll be able to monitor the growth of the plant. After about a week, you will see white bumps, and after about 4 weeks, you should see roots forming. You can use tap water as long as you don't have a water softener. Softened water has too much sodium for hibiscus to propagate successfully."

          "description":"If you took your cuttings later in the season, they might be a darker green color and have some bark growing on them, which can make rooting more difficult. Prepare a container with 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of topsoil, and use a pencil to make holes for the cuttings. Gently place the cuttings into the holes and press the soil around them. Don't push the stems into the soil without making a hole first because the grittiness of the dirt can damage the stem and remove the rooting hormone."

Leave the plastic slightly open at the bottom or cut vents into the top to allow for airflow over the cuttings as they grow."

If you notice that the soil is wet, remove the plastic bag and reduce watering to every other day. Overwatering can cause root rot. If the soil dries out quickly, give the cuttings more water during the day. If the problem persists, move the container to an area that is slightly cooler or receives less sunlight."
