If you\u2019re in a hurry, thaw the puff pastry dough by setting it on the countertop at room temperature for 30-40 minutes. If you\u2019re thawing it on the countertop, keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn\u2019t become too warm and limp. Once the puff pastry has thawed, use it within 24 hours. The pastry box should have thawing instructions specific to the brand of puff pastry."

Leave it for a few minutes and try again once it\u2019s more thawed. Go slowly as you unroll it to prevent cracks from forming. Peel off any liners that you find in the packaging of the puff pastry dough. If the dough does crack, wet your fingers and press the seams together gently to rejoin them."

This will keep the puff pastry from sticking to you as you work with it. Sprinkle flour, sugar, or cheese on your work surface as well to keep the puff pastry from sticking to it. If you\u2019re making a sweet recipe, sprinkle cinnamon sugar on the puff pastry. A recipe calling for cheese should have a puff pastry sprinkled with grated cheese."

For example, you might cut it into small triangles or squares for small appetizers, or leave the puff pastry in one large circle for a crust. Keep the puff pastry chilled when you\u2019re working with it to make cutting it easier. If there are pieces that are thawed but you aren\u2019t ready to use them yet, keep them in the fridge."

Try not to weigh the pastry down with an excessive amount of fillings or toppings so it\u2019s still easy to eat.
