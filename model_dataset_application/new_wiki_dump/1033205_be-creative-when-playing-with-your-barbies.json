You can fill it with furniture and have Barbie decorate her home, use her kitchen, lounge in her bedroom, or chat with friends in her living room. Have Barbie throw a dinner party in her home, inviting other dolls and eating great food. Barbie could host a sleepover at her house and watch a funny movie."

Use other dolls or toys to be the sick patients, and have Barbie check their throat, ears, nose, temperature, and breathing to see if she can help them get better. Pretend Barbie is a surgeon and is operating on another doll to save its life, or have Barbie fix up another doll\u2019s broken arm or ankle."

Let Barbie relax on a towel under a beach umbrella in the sand while she reads a book or talks to a friend. Use a piece of fabric or a washcloth as Barbie\u2019s beach towel. Put Barbie in her bathing suit so she can soak up some sun. Create a beach umbrella using a decorative drink umbrella, or by cutting an umbrella shape out of paper and sticking a toothpick or pencil through the middle. Add a small tub of water next to the sand to create an \u201cocean.\u201d"

Curl Barbie\u2019s hair using pipe cleaners and hot water, or dye her hair with food coloring mixed with water. To curl Barbie\u2019s hair, take small sections of her hair and roll each section up on a small piece of pipe cleaner, just as you would real hair curlers. Dip her hair in hot water and let it dry. Mix a drop or 2 of food coloring in a bowl of water before dipping Barbie\u2019s hair into the colored water. This works best if Barbie has blonde hair."

You can even create small books for everyone to read and learn from! Barbie doesn\u2019t just have to be a school teacher - have her teach other dolls how to ride a horse, how to make a cake, or how to swim. Tape a piece of paper up on the wall to use as the chalkboard. Make books by cutting paper into sections that are roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) wide and 2 in (5.1 cm) long. Fold these sections in half and add a staple right on the folded line."

Use a phone or video camera to film each scene so you can watch it later on. Plan out each scene before filming, such as which props you\u2019ll need and what Barbie will say. Ask friends or family members to help you shoot the movie so that you can have more characters in it. For example, you could film the movie outside and pretend that Barbie is stuck on an island and needs to be rescued."

Have Barbie travel from room to room, meeting new people and trying new things. Barbie could also travel by plane, bus, boat, bicycle, or train. For example, you could pretend that each room in your house is a different country, and Barbie takes a plane to France, Greece, and Japan to try out their food. Take Barbie on a road trip to go shopping, hear music, or experience a festival."

Slide the dress over Barbie\u2019s head and use a ribbon or piece of string to tie it at the waist. Make sure the main hole in Barbie\u2019s dress is big enough for her head to fit through.

You can either sew the fabric to create a cover for the sponge, or you can glue the fabric onto the sponge. Do this with at least 2 sponges and then place one flat on the ground with the other up against a wall as a backrest. For a super comfy couch, make the seat of the couch out of 2 sponges stacked on top of one another. To create a long sectional, use 4-6 sponges to form the couch."

Do this all the way around the hair tie to create a fun tutu. Use different colored or patterned ribbon to make the tutu super colorful.

Making Clothing and Furniture for Barbie Cut up balloons to make clothing for Barbie.

Slide the balloon up over Barbie\u2019s body starting at her feet once you\u2019re done. The balloon should be deflated to use it as clothing. Create a dress out of a piece of fabric.

Find pieces of fabric for sewing or crafts around the house and cut them into squares large enough to fit over the sponge, leaving 1 in (2.5 cm) of extra fabric on each side. You can either sew the fabric to create a cover for the sponge, or you can glue the fabric onto the sponge.

For a super comfy couch, make the seat of the couch out of 2 sponges stacked on top of one another. To create a long sectional, use 4-6 sponges to form the couch. Stack empty matchboxes on top of one another to form drawers. You can color, paint, or cover the outside of the matchboxes with paper beforehand, if desired. Place the matchboxes on top of one another, adding drops of glue in between each layer to keep them all in place. Place Barbie\u2019s things, such as her hairbrush, phone, mirror, or books, in the drawers. If you only have one matchbox, prop the matchbox up on something like a piece of cardboard or paper clips and turn it into a one-drawer nightstand. Cover the new drawers with stickers, glitter, or pictures. Turn a shoebox into a bed for Barbie. Find an old shoebox from your closet, garage, or other storage spot and empty it out. Place a washcloth or small blanket inside, as well as something that will be used as a pillow. Now Barbie has a bed ready for sleeping! Create a pillow by stuffing a piece of fabric or a cloth bag with tissues or stuffing. Decorate the sides of the bed using markers, pencils, or paint. Tie ribbon onto a small hair band to make a tutu for Barbie. Find an extra hair tie and ribbon that you like. Cut the ribbon into 6 in (15 cm) sections, and then tie the ribbon onto the hair tie so that the middle of the ribbon is where the knot is. Do this all the way around the hair tie to create a fun tutu. Use different colored or patterned ribbon to make the tutu super colorful. If your hair tie is too big and won\u2019t fit Barbie, find a rubber band and cut it before tying a new knot to make it the perfect size. Design chairs using cardboard and paper clips. Use scissors to cut cardboard into strips that are at least 3 in (7.6 cm) wide. By bending these strips of cardboard, you can create simple chairs or chaise lounges. If you want the chair to stand up off the ground, bend paper clips to form chair ends and use glue or tape to attach them to the bottom of the chairs.
