  "text":" Creating the shape Make dough. You can use a brioche recipe, canned dough, or a pizza mix. Follow the directions on the package or the recipe. Sprinkle out flour on the surface you are working on. This will keep the dough from sticking, and make your job much easier. Be careful to not get flour everywhere! Take your lump of dough and cut in half, then in half again. Separate these pieces, and place three off to the side, leaving one in front of you. Roll one piece out until it is flat, then take a plate and cut around it to make a circular piece of dough. Use a medium sized plate, unless you are making a GIANT star bread. Do the same with the other pieces. Use the same plate. Warm up your Nutella or other spread by placing it in a bowl of hot water. You can also take some out into a bowl and microwave it in a safe bowl for 10 seconds (depending on your microwave). Take one of the circular pieces and spread Nutella all over it. Of course, you could use the commercially available Nutella spoon,  but a knife will work just as well, if not better. Place another circular piece on top, and spread more Nutella on top of it. Repeat this process until you have used all your pieces. You can try to have more layers, but four work the best. Carefully transfer it to a baking sheet. Take a cup, place it in the middle of the layers, and divide the parts not covered by the cup into sixteenths. First, divide it into fourths (1/4), then divide each of those in half (1/8), then divide each of those in half (1/16). Remove the glass, take each piece and twist it once all the way around. Pair each piece with another, and twist one clockwise, and the other counterclockwise. Flatten out the edges slightly. You can see it's starting to take shape now. Pinch the ends of the pairs together. Going around, take the pairs that are twisted the opposite way and stick the ends together. Finished creating the shape.  Cooking and Eating Preheat your oven at 360\u00b0 F (180\u00b0 C). Following the directions on your oven, heat it until it is warm enough. Brush a light coat of egg-whites. Using a brush, sponge or other spreader, put a very thin coat of the egg whites. Put it in the oven for about 15 minutes. When it is nice and golden, take it out. Break off pieces of the star.
