You can leave 1 sink on to help equalize the pressure; any sink will work. Turn it on all the way. Otherwise, every other faucet must be turned off all the way in your home. Locate your shut-off valve. In most areas, the valve is located outside. Check outside near the street. You may notice a grate in the ground.

Turning Well Water Back On Turn the upper valve at the water pump. You may notice a pipe coming up and over the water pump. It may have a ball valve (which will look like a lever). Turn this so that it is parallel with the pipe. If you have a wheel-shaped gate valve at the bottom of your water pump, do not turn this to the on position. Leave it closed. Locate the electrical switches. In most cases, the electrical power for the well pump will be shut off at the same time as the water itself. You may have 2 switches: one near the pump and one at the main electrical breaker. Check both to see if they have been switched off. Flip the switch on. If you have 2 switches that are turned off, turn on the main electrical switch on first and then turn on the switch next to the pump. Make sure that there is no standing water under or around you.

It will take a few minutes before you can use water. You may hear water in the pipes. As it fills, you can turn on a sink to see if it is working. The sink should sputter and spit for several minutes. If the water doesn't start running, call a plumber. Dewinterizing a House Turn off all faucets. If you winterized the house, you may have left all of the faucets open. Go through the building and turn all of these faucets off for any showers, sinks, or baths you have. If you would like, you can remove the aerators from your sinks to prevent mineral build-up when the water starts. Turn on supply valves.
