You can find dedicated caulk removal tools in home improvement stores. Run this tool along the joint between the toilet and the floor to scrape out any old caulk. If you don\u2019t have a caulk removal tool handy, you can also use a utility or razor knife to loosen the caulk at one end. Aim to pull it up in 1 long strip. You can make an old caulking job easier to clean up by applying commercial caulk removers before scraping. If you do, make sure to check the product\u2019s label to prevent any possible damage to your floors or toilet."

          "description":"After clearing the joint of any caulk, you\u2019ll want to get the area as clean as possible. Scoop out any debris, such as paint chips, dirt or rust. Use a general purpose bathroom cleaner and a rag to clean in and around the joint. The cleaner you can get the area, the better of a seal you\u2019ll be able to apply. After cleaning, you can wipe the area with rubbing alcohol to disinfect it. Press a tissue around the base of the toilet to check for moisture. If you find a leak, remove the toilet and replace the wax ring before continuing. If any water or other liquid gets in the joint, do your best to dry it. If you can\u2019t quite reach it, make sure to allow enough time for it to dry properly. Overnight should be sufficient. Caulking over liquid will trap it, which can cause damage to your flooring. Ensure the toilet is even and tight to the floor. If it moves, tighten the bolts or use a shim to straighten it out. Don\u2019t use the caulk to secure the toilet to the floor if it\u2019s loose or uneven."

          "headline":"Apply masking tape to the floor.",
          "description":"Not only will this help you get a straighter, smoother seal, but it will prevent any caulk from getting on your floors. Put masking tape on either side of the joint, one following the toilet\u2019s base and the other along the floor. If you\u2019re particularly worried about your caulking abilities, you can use a second strip on either side to double the width of masking tape and protect more of your floors. Since most toilets have a round base, you\u2019ll probably have to use several strips of tape to properly follow the curve. Tear up pieces a few inches long, and apply them to the floor, following the curve of the toilet\u2019s base. Alternatively, you can also buy masking tape that comes curved and is more flexible than typical tape. This will save you some time in taping up your floor."

Silicone caulk is typically a bit more expensive than other types, but that extra money will save you the problems that come with an improper seal. It\u2019s important to match the color of your caulk to your bathroom. White usually fits most styles, but you\u2019ll still want to give this some thought."

The main part of the gun is the plastic body, which holds the tube. The plunger is a metal pole with a flat end that runs the length of the body. At the back of the body, you\u2019ll find a metal release, usually shaped like a trigger. Push this forward and you\u2019ll be able to pull back the plunger. You can then insert the caulk tube and push the plunger into the back of the tube."

          "description":"Pull on the trigger and keep the caulk gun at a 45-degree angle. Keep your pressure on the trigger consistent and the movement of the caulk gun slow and smooth to ensure a better seal. Use the hand not holding the gun to press the tip of the caulk tube against the joint to ensure that the caulk is pushed into the joint. Pushing the caulk rather than pulling it along will make it more difficult to create a consistent seal. You may want to have a folded up piece of cardboard available nearby to lay the caulk gun onto if you need to stop for any reason. This will prevent caulk from dribbling onto your floors. If you\u2019re having trouble getting your caulk gun behind the toilet, try using caulk in a squeeze tube, which should allow you more flexibility."

You can discard any caulk buildup directly in the garbage. If you placed a piece of cardboard down to hold your caulk gun, you can simply collect the caulk there for disposal later.
