          "description":"The best means to remove spider webs is by simply using a vacuum. A handheld vacuum would be easiest to maneuver. However, if you don't have a handheld vacuum you can also use a vacuum with an extension nozzle. Simply use the nozzle or handheld vacuum to suck up any webs you see. If webs are stuck in, you may have to go over the area quite a few times. If you notice any cobwebs on furniture or curtains, vacuum over them. Then, use a lint roller to remove any leftover bits of web. Be sure to check under furniture. Some types of spiders may make webs in dark areas. Once a week, flip over your couches, chairs, tables, and other items of furniture to check for webs. If you notice any webs, vacuum them up."

Using duct tape can be a good trick. Take a regular paint roller and wrap duct tape around it, with the sticky side of the tape facing outward.

If you want to remove spider webs from these places, follow guidelines often used for cleaning older windows. Spray down the window and screen with water. You can use either a hose or a spray bottle. If you're spraying from outside, a garden hose with a spray nozzle attached can be sprayed onto the window. You can spray into the screen, aiming at the unwanted spider webs. If you're spraying inside, just use a standard spray bottle. Remove the screen and use a smaller spray bottle to dislodge any remaining spider webs. From there, clean the windows with your chosen cleaning supplies. You can use window sprays you would buy at a local department store or simply use soap and water. Clean the window thoroughly, making sure to remove any remaining residue from the spider webs. To prevent reoccurrence, replace screens that have cracks and tears in them. This will stop spiders from getting into your home to begin with."

This will get rid of spider eggs and kill any spiders still living in them. You can buy bleach at a local department store or online. Make sure to read any instructions provided before use. Always dilute bleach with water to the levels recommended on the container. For most homes, one gallon of bleach is all you'll need. If you're spraying bleach outside, you'll need to purchase some kind of bleach sprayer. You can do so online or at a local department store. You also may need a garden hose or adjustable spray nozzle. If you're bleaching in your home, a big sprayer might have too much force. You can simply mix bleach and water in a small handheld spray bottle. Make sure to wear protective gloves when handling bleach. It can be corrosive to skin. Always mix bleach with lukewarm or cold water, not hot water, which can cause the release of harmful chlorine gas. Never mix bleach with other household chemicals."

Mix about two tablespoons of dish soap into warm water. Then, add 5 drops of tea tree oil and an ounce of neem oil. Sprinkle this mixture around your home in areas where you've noticed spiders.

If you've only seen spiders in a few spots in your home, consider a powder insecticide. If you're trying to create a boundary around your home, look into a liquid insecticide.
