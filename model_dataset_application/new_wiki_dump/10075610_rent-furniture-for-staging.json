Furniture rental businesses are more common than you might expect, as they cater to businesses, realtors, individual homeowners, and even members of the entertainment industry. This means you\u2019re likely to find one near you. Many furniture rental companies are chains, with multiple stores located throughout a particular region. Some furniture stores allow customers to lease pieces temporarily. Try asking around at conventional retailers if your search doesn\u2019t turn up any dedicated rental centers."

Viewing a company\u2019s website will give you a better idea of the exact services they provide, as well as their signature decorating style and general price range. Compare several different rental companies (assuming you have more than a couple to choose from) to find one that best suits your sensibilities and budget.

Some good questions to ask include \"Where do you source your furniture? \", \"Is it possible to pick out pieces individually?\" and \"How long does a standard rental agreement last?\" You can usually find a company\u2019s contact information in the upper or lower part of their website. If you don\u2019t see it there, look for a \u201cContact Us\u201d tab on their homepage.

          "description":"If you're staging your whole house for walkthroughs, you'll want to have enough pieces on display to tie each room together. This will call for large, coordinated items like beds, armoires, tables, and seating areas. If you're only planning on listing 1 or 2 rooms, you can probably get away with renting a single set of furnishings in your preferred theme. There's no need to fill out every room from wall to wall\u2014the idea is simply to give interested parties a sense of what a particular room would look like once it's furnished. When staging an office, focus on attention-grabbing pieces that will expect to see, such as desks, filing cabinets, client seating, and display cases for awards and distinctions."

          "headline":"Pick out furniture by style.",
          "description":"The pieces leased by furniture rental companies are typically grouped together as packages based on popular decorating themes such as modern, rustic, urban, and townhouse. Browsing by style is probably the easiest way to find furniture that complements your living space without having to select each item individually. When you shop by style, you\u2019ll receive a complete set of furnishings that have been curated based on a common look. Furniture packages are often categorized by room, which makes it possible to mix-and-match different styles between rooms. For example, you might fill your living room with contemporary minimalist pieces and select a rustic French chateau motif for the master bedroom."

          "description":"If you\u2019re working on a budget, see if you can filter your search results by price. You\u2019ll then be shown only the items that are priced at or below the maximum amount you\u2019re willing to pay. This will help keep the final cost of your staging project as low as possible. Complete furniture packages typically range in price from $150-400 per month, while individual pieces may be listed for as low as $15-30. Keep in mind that staging your home is intended to raise its perceived value. By sticking to a predetermined price point, you can avoid overspending and ultimately walk away with more to show for your efforts."

There, you\u2019ll find items separated by type, such as beds, sofas, tables, chairs, and lighting fixtures. Some companies even stock functional appliances and other accessories like wall art and miscellaneous decorations. Be sure to write down the name or item number of each piece along with its price to keep track of how much you can expect to spend. Picking out furniture individually can be useful when you\u2019re sprucing up a room that doesn\u2019t fall into one of the usual categories, or you want to put your own personal touch on your living space. In some cases, it may be possible to add individual items to a pre-curated package for an additional charge."

These items are perfect for giving homes a lived-in quality, especially in cozy, intimate quarters like bedrooms and bathrooms. Consider spending a little extra on a few wall hangings, sculptures, and other pieces of artwork. The right selections can make any home feel more cultured. Depending on how extensive a company's inventory is, you might even be able to find small accessories like woven baskets, candles, and flower arrangements for as little as a few dollars apiece."

They\u2019ll be able to make recommendations based on your home\u2019s unique features and walk you through the process of getting it show-ready from beginning to end. Many furniture rental companies employ their own designers to help customers stage their homes more effectively. Their services can usually be secured with an additional consulting fee. Not all companies have consultants on staff. If the one you\u2019re leasing from doesn\u2019t, it may be necessary to hire an outside staging expert.

This contract simply states that you\u2019re paying to lease the items mentioned for an agreed-upon time. Leases are typically offered for 6, 12, 18, or 24 month periods. As a general rule, the longer your lease, the better deal you\u2019ll get. Review the rental agreement closely before you put your name on it.

You may have to set up an online account through the rental company\u2019s website in order to manage your monthly payments. See about setting up automatic recurring payments, if possible.

Ultimately, you have the final say when it comes to how your home is presented.

With some companies, you might also be able to return rented items as soon as you're done staging your home, usually after it's sold or you've taken photos.
