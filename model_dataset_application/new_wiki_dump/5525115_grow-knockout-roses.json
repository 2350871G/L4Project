          "description":"Knock Out roses grow best in soil with a pH of 6 to 6.5. Soil test kits are generally available at garden centers. Take the soil test sample from 4 inches deep and do not touch it with your hands. If you do touch it, your skin could change the pH of the sample. Let the sample dry, break it up into fine pieces, place it in the pH test chamber and add distilled water along with the test chemical. Shake it up and check the color of the water against the color chart provided with the kit."

          "description":"The amount of lime or aluminum sulfate required depends on the soil type. Sandy soil will require about 12 ounces of lime to raise the pH of 25 square feet of soil from 5.5 to 6 or about 2 ounces of aluminum sulfate to change the pH from 7 to 6.5. More lime or aluminum sulfate must be used to change the pH of loamy or clay soil. Sprinkle the aluminum sulfate or lime evenly over the soil and mix it in thoroughly with a tiller before planting the rose."

Spread it all the way around the rose in an area that extends 3 feet away from the base of the shrub. If the soil pH is too high, the rose may develop chlorosis which causes the leaves to turn yellow."
