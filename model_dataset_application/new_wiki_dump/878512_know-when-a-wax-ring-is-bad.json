Sometimes they can just be removed with a deep well socket, but many times they are corroded and have to be cut or broken off. There are many ways to cut these bolts, but the best way I have found is with a rotary tool or one of the new vibrating tools. Cut next to the base of the toilet, not underneath. There is a flange that the toilet bolts to underneath of the toilet. If you mess this up it has to be replaced and the part can be expensive and is a pain to change."

Wax rings are a pain if you do not do this every day. With a wax ring, when it comes time to set the toilet to the floor, you have one chance to get it right. If everything is not lined up perfectly, you have ruined the ring and now have to go get another. The rubber gasket allows you to adjust the toilet into place until everything lines up. Make sure you don't put the gasket in upside down. It will fit the flange very well one way, and not well at all the other."
