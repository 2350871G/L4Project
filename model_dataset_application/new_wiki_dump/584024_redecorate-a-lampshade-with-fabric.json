  "text":" Protect a table with layers of newspaper.  Gather your lamp and supplies.  Place the lamp in an upright position on the table, leaving the shade on the lamp.  Using a fabric tape measure, measure the diameter of the lower rim, as well as the height of the shade.  Cut fabric to this exact diameter and height, allowing for a half-inch seam allowance on all sides. This should result in a rectangular piece of fabric. With right sides together, stitch the two shorter sides of the rectangle together, leaving a half-inch seam allowance. This should result in a tube-shaped piece of fabric. Turn the tube right side out.  Slide the tube over the top of the shade. It should fit snugly around the lower rim. Align, glue and pin the lower edge of the tube to the lower rim of the shade.  Allow the glue to dry to prevent the fabric from moving.  Neatly pleat and fold the fabric around the upper rim of the shade. Align, glue and pin it in place. Allow the glue to dry. Remove all common pins. Using scissors, carefully trim away any excess fabric that protrudes beyond the upper or lower rims.  Align, glue and pin a row of dangling, sparkling beads to the lower edge of the shade.  Allow the glue to dry. Remove all common pins.
