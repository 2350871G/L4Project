Indian Pale Ales (IPAs) have more hops and are generally bitter. This category includes pale ales, wheat beers, bitters, porters, stouts, barley wines, brown ales and tripels. Watch out for tripels \u2013 they've been fermented several times and can knock you off your feet. Lagers. These ferment slowly and tend to have a \"crisper\" flavor than ales and are, in general, less \"hoppy.\" Think of  Heineken, Bud Light, Natural Light, Harp, Corona, Miller Genuine Draft \u2013 these are all light lagers. This category also includes pilsners, Vienna lagers, bocks and marzens. Stouts. These really fall under the \"ale\" umbrella, but they are their own beast. A stout is dark and often creamy, with tastes of chocolate and coffee undertones. There's also oatmeal and oyster stouts, too. For these, think Guinness, Beamish, and Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stouts. Bitters. These are English ales that have a deep bronze look and a well-hopped flavor (in other words, bitter). In general, they have greater depth than IPAs. It's hard to qualify their taste beyond that as there are several categories: session or ordinary bitter, best or regular bitter and premium or strong bitter (often called Extra Special Bitters (ESB)). Wheat Beer (or Hefeweizen). This is an ale with a light yet hazy appearance. It often has a slight banana or clove flavor. Sometimes it's spicy or apple-y, too. It's not bitter and it's often served with a wedge of lemon."

Ideally, most beers should be kept around 50\u201355 \u00b0F (10\u201313 \u00b0C). Anything higher and the lifespan of your beer will be shortened; anything lower and you'll make it hazy or cloudy. Wanna get technical? Strong beers (like barleywines, tripels, dark ales) will be best enjoyed when kept just below room temperature, around 55-60F. Standard ales (like bitters, IPAs, dobbelbocks, lambics, stouts, etc) should be at \"cellar temperature, 50-55F. Lighter beers (think lagers, pilsners, wheat beers, milds, etc) should be around refrigerated temperature, or 45-50F.
