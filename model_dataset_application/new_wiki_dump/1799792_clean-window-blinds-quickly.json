  "text":" Dusting Get your duster. This is an essential tool. Position the blinds so they are all the way open and are perfectly horizontal. Make sure every piece is accessible. Insert the duster into each space in between the blinds. Start at the top first, so that if any dust falls, it will fall onto the blind spaces you haven't cleaned yet. Swipe side to side, swiping the whole blind. If the duster is thick enough it should clean the top of a blind and the bottom of one. Repeat for each blind.  Vinegar scrub Bang two nails into a tall wooden fence, or inside the shower stall.  Hang blinds from the nails.  Open one way.  Using vinegar, warm water, and a scrubbing brush or a magic sponge, clean one side. Open the other way, and repeat. Let soak for about 20 minutes. Hose off with an outdoor hose or shower hose. Repeat if needed. ",
