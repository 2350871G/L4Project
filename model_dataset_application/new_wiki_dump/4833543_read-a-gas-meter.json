          "description":"Your analog meter should have 4 or 5 dials in a row along the top of its face. Together, they produce a 4- or 5- digit reading. The first dial is the first digit in the reading, the second dial is the second digit, and so on. Most analog gas meters have 4 dials, but yours may have 5. The number of dials depends on the type of meter used by your gas company, as well as when it was manufactured. When a smaller dial makes a revolution, the next-higher dial goes up 1 point. Keep in mind that dials rotate in the opposite direction of the 1 next to them. For example, the first and third dials might turn counter clockwise, while the second and fourth dials turn clockwise."

This means the dial still represents the smaller number until the needle reaches the next highest digit. For example, if the needle is pointing between 4 and 5, you\u2019d write down 4. This is true even if the needle is closer to the 5. If the needle is pointing between 0 and 9, you\u2019d choose 9 even though it\u2019s a higher number, since it comes before 0 on the dial."

However, you shouldn't use the number the needle is pointing at until the dial to its right has fully completed its revolution. Check that the dial to the right has passed 0, which means the revolution is complete. If the dial to its right has passed 0, then use the number the needle is hovering over.

If you want to estimate your bill or compare readings, it\u2019s important to know how they take this reading. You can call and talk to customer service, or you can check their website.
