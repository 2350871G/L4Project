          "description":"The cocoa butter in chocolate can absorb odors from other items in your fridge like cheese, meats, or cooked dishes. Refrigerators are also very humid and that moisture can cause the sugars to redistribute, causing condensation to form on the surface of the chocolate, which changes its texture. However, if the chocolate has a creamy filling (like truffles or specialty chocolate bars), it's best to refrigerate it to prevent the filling from going bad. If you do end up putting chocolate truffles or cream-filled bars into the refrigerator, let it come to room temperature before you unwrap it. This will prevent \"sugar bloom,\" which is when surface-level condensation dissolves some of the sugars and recrystallizes, resulting in a white coating and grainy texture."
