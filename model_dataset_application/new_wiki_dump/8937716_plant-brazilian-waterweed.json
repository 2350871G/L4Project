This pH range will facilitate the growth of the Brazilian Waterweed. You can buy pH testing kits at your local pet store as well as online. Controlling your aquarium\u2019s pH level is done with two products: acid and alkaline buffers. The former lowers the water\u2019s pH level, while the latter will increase it.

A good rule of thumb to ensure you give your plant the right amount of light is to use a lighting system that\u2019s 2-4 watts per gallon (3.8 liters) of water."

Any closer together and the plants won\u2019t have enough room to grow. Note that many people prefer to have their plants in gravel or sand for aesthetics. Floating plants will survive and grow just fine; it\u2019s more about how you want your tank to look."

You should avoid spurring its growth further, or you can expect to do a lot of trimming. If you have other plants in your aquarium, you may not have a choice but to use nutrient-rich soil. Be ready to trim your Brazilian Waterweed if this is the case."

Depending on your tank, you might be able to simply let the plant float for a different look, especially in larger tanks. However, the plant might grow to obscure your tank\u2019s light source and crowd other plants in your aquarium. You\u2019ll likely need to trim it often to avoid this."
