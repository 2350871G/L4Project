If you find your firebox needs repair, it is best to consult a professional for a fireplace and chimney inspection. Inspecting the flue and damper Understand the terms used. The flue allows smoke to move through the chimney and the damper is the opening you can adjust to control the intact of air and temperature of your fire. Make sure that the damper opens, closes and seals properly. It should move quite easily and should be free of ash and debris. If the damper seems blocked, try cleaning it. Open it as widely as possible and get in there with a stiff bristle brush, focusing on the edges. It might be hard to see, so have someone hold a flashlight up for you and put a mirror on the bottom of the firebox to help you see the hard-to-reach places. Checking the chimney Get the chimney swept annually. If you use your wood burning fireplace often, it is recommended that you have it swept out at least once a year at the beginning of winter. Hiring a chimney sweep is the easiest and safest way to remove soot and debris from inside the chimney that could potentially cause a fire. Sweeping the chimney should be left to a professional, as having the appropriate tools and knowledge is necessary. Check the chimney's exterior. Go outside and give your chimney an exterior inspection. Make sure that the chimney cap is in good shape. Check the following:\nThere's no bird nest or debris buildup on the cap.

Gas fireplaces are less maintenance, but they still need an annual inspection to ensure they're running safely and efficiently. Look over the glass plate and make sure there are no cracks. If you have a glass door, make sure it latches and seals properly. Turn off the gas at the shut-off valve and test the pilot light and igniter. Fire it up and check for any clogged log holes. You can clean those out with a needle. If your gas fireplace vents outside, look around the vent for black marks or scorching. If you find them, it might mean the ceramic logs will have to be cleaned.",
