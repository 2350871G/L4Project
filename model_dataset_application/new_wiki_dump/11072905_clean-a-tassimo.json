It's often hidden in a slot at the back near the bottom, but it could be in another area of your machine, based on what type you have. Look for a hidden slot that has a yellow or orange disc sticking out. Pull the disc out. If you can't find where the disc is located, check the instruction manual that came with your machine. You'll need this disc to clean your machine. If you lost it, you can buy a replacement part online."

If you prefer, you can just use a cup or other container to fill the tank while it's still in the machine. You'll be running water through the machine, so it needs to have enough for the process. Half a tank is more than enough for a quick cleaning, as you'll only be running the water through once. If you want to run the water through more than once, you may need to fill it up a bit more."

Remove the tank so that you can add water to it from the sink. If you prefer, you can just use a cup or other container to add water to the tank instead of taking it out of the machine. Try to descale the machine about every 400 cups you make. You can estimate when to do it based on how many cups you drink a day. Add 2 descaling tablets to the tank. Just drop them into the water.

Slip it back into its holding spot for next time. Refill the tank so you're ready to make coffee! Cleaning the Parts Pull out the drip catch at the bottom for cleaning. Simply grab a hold of the drip catch and pull it gently out. Then, it will usually come apart into 2 sections, the lid and the basin. Scrub it with soap, water, and a sponge or simply place it in the dishwasher for cleaning. Make sure to turn your machine off before taking parts off. If you're not sure how your machine comes apart, check your manual or look online for your particular machine. Remove the backing to the cup holder if yours comes off. This part is the one that forms the curve behind your cup when you set it in place. It can get dirty from coffee splashes, so in some machines, this just pulls out. Brace your hand against the machine and use your other hand to pop it out. Scrub it down in the sink with soap and water or place it in the dishwasher for cleaning. If it doesn't seem to want to come out, simply wipe this area down with a damp rag and a bit of dishwashing soap. Unhook the pod holder in the brew head. Open the brew head at the front, and you should see a clip that holds pods in place. It may raise up when you lift the brew head. Pull on it gently and lift up to unhook the clips at the back. You can scrub this down or put it in the dishwasher. Always check your manual to see which parts come out and which ones are dishwasher safe. Pop out the nozzle/piercing unit to clean it.
