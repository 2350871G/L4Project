  "text":" Making the Dough Pour the water into a bowl. It's important that you use water that's very warm, but not too hot! Hot water could kill the yeast. Warm water will wake it up without killing it, which is what you want - that way the yeast will help the bread rise. Add the yeast and sugar. Use a spoon to stir it all together. The yeast will begin to react with the sugar, and the mixture will become bubbly and foamy. This should happen within just a few minutes. If 3 minutes have passed and nothing has happened, your yeast might be stale, and you may need to use another batch. You could also try again using water that's a little warmer or cooler, depending on what temperature you initially tried. Pour the flour into a big mixing bowl. Five cups will yield two loaves of bread. You can use either all-purpose flour or bread flour. The bread flour might have a bit more height, but all-purpose flour works just fine, too. Add the oil, salt and yeast mixture. Pour them one at a time over the flour. Mix the dough. Use either a mixture with a dough hook attachment, a hand mixer or a wooden spoon to mix all the ingredients until they come together in a big, sticky ball of dough. Rising and Kneading Put the ball of dough in an oiled bowl. You can wash out the mixing bowl and oil that one, or use a separate oiled bowl. It should be at least twice the size as the ball of dough, so the dough has room to rise. Cover the dough and put it in a warm place. Cover it loosely with plastic wrap - it shouldn't be airtight - or place a clean dishcloth over the bowl. Put it in a warm area in your kitchen. If your kitchen tends to be drafty, preheat your oven to 200 degrees, turn it off, and put the bowl in there. It'll be just the right temperature for the dough to rise.

Dividing and Baking Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180\u00b0C).  Divide the dough. Roll it out or press it into a circular shape, like a pizza crust.
