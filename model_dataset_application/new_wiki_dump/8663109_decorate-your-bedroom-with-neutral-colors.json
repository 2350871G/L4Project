By tinting a bright color with white or black and combining it with another color, you can create a new hue. For example, you can turn red into a neutral color by tinting it with white and mixing it with brown. Using a variety of shades will help your bedroom feel balanced, as well as unified. Make sure that the neutral colors you choose are cohesive and go well together."

          "description":"Use both cool and warm neutrals to balance your room. Warm neutrals will brighten up a cool bedroom, while cool neutrals will tone down a bright room. For example, if your bedroom walls are painted a cool neutral color like navy blue, then brighten up the room with warm pieces of furniture like a white chaise lounge and gold bedside tables. Warm colors like brass and gold pair well with cool colors like gray and navy."

          "headline":"Incorporate 1 or 2 accent colors.",
          "description":"Accent colors are a great way to prevent a room from having a washed out look. When choosing accent colors, use colors with brown or gray undertones. For example, if your color palette is cream, gray, and beige, include an indigo throw blanket, pillows, or rug to add color to your bedroom. Muted colors, like pastel green or yellow, accent a neutral space nicely. You can add dimension with metallics like silver, gold, and bronze."
