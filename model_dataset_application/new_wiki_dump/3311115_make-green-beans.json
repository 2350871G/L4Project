  "text":" Boiling Fresh Green Beans Bring a pot of water to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add salt to the water once it begins to boil.  Trim the stems of the green beans and place them into the pot of gently boiling water.  Leave the green beans in the pot for 4 or 5 minutes, until they are cooked but still crisp.  Drain the green beans and cover them in ice water to stop the cooking process.  Serve with salt, pepper and any other seasonings or herbs and spices that you like. Green beans will be bright green and crunchy. Steaming Fresh Green Beans Place whole green beans that have been rinsed and trimmed of their stems into a steamer.  Cover the green beans and steam for about 20 minutes.  Remove the green beans from the heat. They should be tender but still maintain some crispness. Sautee Green Beans Heat olive oil in a sautee pan over medium heat. Add a little butter to the oil for extra flavor and if you do not mind the additional fat and calories. Add green beans to the pan. You can use fresh, frozen or canned green beans when saut\u00e8ing them, but you may find best results with fresh green beans. Toss the beans in the oil as they cook.  Season beans with salt, pepper and anything else you like such as garlic or red pepper flakes.  Remove from heat after about 5 minutes and serve while hot.  Stewing Green Beans Place fresh, frozen or canned green beans in a pot over low heat.  Add your favorite liquid to the pot. You can use water, wine, broth or something like stewed tomatoes to provide the necessary liquid and additional flavor to the beans. Allow the beans to cook over low heat for 30 to 40 minutes. They will be soft and ready to serve right from the pot. Making Green Beans in the Microwave Start with frozen or canned green beans. Fresh green beans are better prepared using one of the other methods, and they will take longer to cook in the microwave. Place the green beans in a microwave safe bowl. Follow the instructions on the package or the can. Microwave on high for as long as the package recommends, usually between 2 and 5 minutes. You may need to let them sit in the microwave for 1 minute before serving.",
