Bell peppers, also called sweet peppers, are the most mild of all the pepper varieties. They come in shades of red, orange, yellow, and green and tend to be about the size of a fist. Grow these to eat raw or add to many dishes. Hot peppers come in many different varieties. The most mild of all the hot peppers is the anaheim pepper, but other popular varieties include the jalapeno and the serrano pepper."

Avoid planting peppers in an area in complete shade. If your soil is very rocky or tends to flood in the rain, consider using pots or building a raised bed for your peppers."

This step isn\u2019t mandatory, but could help you determine the most effective strategy for keeping your soil and plants healthy."

If your soil is typically acidic, consider working some lime into it a few months before planting, then conducting a second pH test to ensure you\u2019re in the desired range. If your soil is too alkaline, use peat moss or garden sulfur."

Hot peppers take the longest - about 12 weeks until maturity - while bell peppers take about 8 weeks to reach maturity. Peppers don\u2019t grow in cold or frosty soil, so wait to plant them until the weather has warmed enough. Plant peppers outside at least one month after your last day of frost for the best temperature of soil. You can look up the last frost date in your area on the Internet or in a farmers\u2019 almanac\nChoose a date that you feel matches the temperature requirements of outdoor soil for you peppers, and count back 8-10 weeks from that date; this is when you will start your seedlings.

Place the seeds in a cup of water and leave them for 2-8 hours, or until the sink to the bottom of the cup. Make a cup of weak chamomile tea to disinfect the seeds and break down the seed coats.

Use a store-bought seed tray for the easiest place to sow your seeds, or make your own using an old plastic or cardboard milk jug with holes poked in the bottom.

About two weeks before you plan to transfer your plants outdoors, you need to gradually expose the plants to the outdoor climate. Start by placing your seedlings outdoors for a few hours each day, in an area protected from direct sunlight and wind. Slowly extend the number of hours the plants stay outside as they continue to grow. Avoid leaving the peppers outside overnight until you\u2019re almost done hardening them off."
