          "description":"After planting echinacea, it can take a couple of years for the flowers to bloom. It is important that you do not harvest anything from your plant until after the flowers have bloomed at least 1 time, and then wait for them to bloom again to harvest them. This will help to ensure that the plant is tough enough to withstand harvesting and has an established root system. Harvest the flower while it's in bloom and before it starts to fade. Keep in mind that echinacea is a valuable garden addition even before you harvest it. It attracts butterflies, provides seed for birds, and repels deer from your garden."

Use a sharp pair of garden shears or scissors to cut the stem of your echinacea right above a node. This method of harvesting is ideal when you want to collect a single stem or just a few stems. Repeat this for each of the stems you want to harvest."

It is best to wait until a plant is mature so that the roots will be as big as possible. This will also provide enough time for some other crowns of echinacea to develop from the original plant. It is also best to dig up echinacea by the roots and divide the clumps once every 3 or 4 years. Time your root harvests in the spring or fall when the weather is cool. You may only get a few clumps from smaller plants or you may get several clumps from larger ones."

Then, use your foot to press down on the spade and lift the plant out by the roots. This will help to ensure that you do not dig into the roots. You may also dig a trench around the plant to loosen it up. Just be careful not to dig too close to it so that you do not damage the roots. Echinacea has wide and deep roots."

Be careful not to break off stems or pieces of the roots as you pull them apart. Separate the larger, older clumps from the smaller, younger clumps and divide them into piles. If a clump is too tough to break apart with your fingers, use a pair of garden shears to cut them apart. You may also want to shake away the excess dirt to make it easier to see the individual crowns."

They will continue growing and you can harvest the roots from these plants in another 1 to 2 years. Make sure that you plant the echinacea in an area of the ground or in a pot with soil that drains well. Avoid tightly packed or clay-type soils. Choose an area with full sun or place potted echinacea in a sunny window. Water the plant deeply after replanting it."
