Jowar flour is very fine, like talc, even while kneading. It's not like all purpose or wheat flour, which require great effort to make a soft dough. Your kneading could be done in about 5-10 minutes. You may add tap water as you knead it, a little at a time. This way you avoid adding too much water. A perfect, finished dough leaves no flour residue on your palms when you're done kneading it."
