If the chicken has been sitting in blood or a commercial brine for several days, though, you can wash it by carefully soaking it in cold water. Cover the chicken in cold water and leave it in the refrigerator for no more than two hours. After two or fewer hours, remove the chicken from the water, carefully pat it dry with clean paper towels, and cook it immediately. Be sure to clean the soaking basin and all surrounding surfaces with hot, soapy water."

  "text":" Preparing the Chicken Soak the chicken in cold water only if necessary. Rinsing chicken is not recommended; doing so won't remove all bacteria and can actually increase the risk of spreading bacteria if the water splashes onto other surfaces.

If you'd prefer, you can also remove the skin, though this isn't essential. Brewing the Soup Add water to cover, salt, and bay leaf. Add enough water to cover all of your chicken, but don't feel the need to over-do it - if your soup is too thick, you can always add more water later, while waiting for a watery soup to reduce is time-consuming. For added flavor, you may optionally add the chicken bouillon at this point as well. Cover the pot and bring to boil. Over medium-high heat, this should take about 8-10 minutes, but may take more or less time depending on how much water you use. Uncover and skim off the top froth. When your water starts boiling, remove the lid and remove the froth at the top with a wooden spoon. This prevents the water from boiling over. Allow to simmer about 2 1/4 hours. Your goal is to make the chicken meat so soft that it falls off the bone.
