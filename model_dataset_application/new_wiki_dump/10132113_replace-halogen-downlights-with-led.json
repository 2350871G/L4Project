Check the bottom of the existing bulb to see how the connectors should look, then use a ruler to check the size of the fitting as well as the size of the cut-out for the bulb. Be sure to reference this information as you\u2019re shopping for LED bulbs. You may be able to find the size of the fitting printed somewhere on the socket. If your bulb has a twist-and-lock fitting with two prongs on the bottom, it\u2019s most likely a 240-volt GU10 bulb, and generally has a 50mm fitting. These can usually be switched for LED bulbs without replacing any parts. If the bulb has 2 sharp pins and pushes into the fitting, it is likely a low-voltage MR11 or MR16 bulb. These 12-volt bulbs require a transformer if you\u2019re using them in place of a halogen bulb."

Since LED bulbs use far less power than halogen bulbs, they will not use the same wattage. However, most LED bulbs list their equivalent wattage on the packaging. If you can\u2019t find the information on the packaging, you can estimate the equivalent wattage. LED bulbs generally use about 10% less power than their halogen counterparts, so a 10-watt bulb would be roughly equivalent to a 100-watt halogen bulb."

Average halogen bulbs are between 650-700 lumens, but you may have different needs for customized lighting effects. If your downlights are used to light a workspace area, you will probably need higher lumens. If your downlights create soft ambient lighting in a gallery space, you might prefer lower lumens."

Most LED bulbs will work with your existing dimmer. However, in some cases, you may have to change the dimmer to a low-voltage version. To replace the dimmer switch, turn off the power to the switch, then unscrew the switch plate and remove it. Pull the switch out of the electrical box and remove the wires, then reattach the wires to the new dimmer switch. Push the new switch into the electrical box and replace the switch plate."

Although some types of bulbs require a short amount of time to warm up, LED bulbs work instantly, just like halogen bulbs. Switching out MR11 or MR16 Lights Turn off the power to the lights before you do anything else. Since you\u2019ll be working with wiring as you replace the transformer, it\u2019s extremely important to follow all electrical safety guidelines. Turn the power off to the lights at your home\u2019s breaker box to ensure you don\u2019t get hurt. If you\u2019re not sure which breaker switch controls the light, try turning them off at the box one by one until the light in the room goes off. Pull out the existing halogen light. MR11 and MR16 lights have pins that push straight into the fitting, so you should be able to pull it straight out of the socket. Dispose of the old bulb by throwing it into the trash. While it\u2019s safe to throw halogen bulbs in with your regular garbage, compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) and fluorescent tubes contain mercury and should be treated like hazardous waste. If you have any of these you need to dispose of, check to see if there is a drop-off location in your area where you can take light bulbs that contain mercury. Remove the fitting and locate the transformer in your MR16 circuit. Use a screwdriver to loosen any screws that are holding the fitting into place and carefully remove it. Follow the wires until you find the transformer, which is usually located just above the light fitting. You may need to go into your attic to access the transformer. Find the transformer's maximum load, or the VA number. This information should be printed somewhere on the body of the transformer, and it may be either a fixed number or a range. If the transformer lists a range, the bottom number is the minimum voltage required for the transformer to function, and the top number is the maximum. If there is only one number, the voltage of your bulbs should match the VA number. If your LED bulbs fall within the transformer\u2019s voltage range, you do not need to replace the transformer.

MR11 and MR16 bulbs use 12 volts of power, so in most cases, they fall below the minimum load for a transformer. If this is the case, unscrew the posts holding the black wires in place to disconnect the transformer, then unscrew the wires that attach the bulb fitting to the transformer. Snip off the ends of the wire and strip 1 in (2.5 cm) of new wire. Using wire strippers, cut off the ends of the wire that were previously attached to the old transformer, then strip off a piece of insulation about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the end of the wire. This will ensure that you are working with fresh, unfrayed wire. Connect the 2 wires to the LED transformer. You will probably need to remove the cover from the LED transformer to expose the posts where the wires attach. Make sure you connect the live wire to the live input and the neutral wire to the neutral side. If you\u2019re not sure which wire is live and which one is neutral, use a voltage tester to test each side. The neutral wire will not have a reading, and the live one will have one. Attach the bulb fitting to the new transformer. Wrap the two wires around the posts on the new transformer, just as they were on the halogen transformer. Attach each fitting separately if you plan on running more than one bulb on the circuit. Make sure if you have more than one bulb on the circuit that you do not exceed the maximum volt load for the new transformer. Install the LED downlight bulb into the fitting and turn it on. The pins on the new bulb should easily snap into the fitting, and your new energy-efficient light is ready to go! Turn the power back on at the circuit box, then flip on the light switch to see your LED light at work.",
