However, instead of joining the two sides together, as you would with a normal heart, leave a tiny bit of space. In other words, you should have a small gap between the two semi circles forming the top curves of your heart, and there should be another small gap where the point would normally form."

Then, create a jagged edge that extends downwards towards the tail of that half, where it normally would meet in a point. This should create a separate half, complete with a jagged edge. This is why you left the two gaps when you drew the outline of your heart. It will allow you to have a bit of space between the two broken pieces. If you didn't leave a gap, you can always draw your jagged line anyways. The heart will still look broken, just not in two pieces."

In other words, where the first half juts in, the second half should poke out. It should appear that, if you were able to bring the two pieces back together, they would fit. This doesn't have to be perfect. You can just eyeball it, and use your first half as a general reference for how the second half should look."

This will walk you through drawing the full outline of a heart, and then you'll simply need to use your eraser to create tiny gaps at the top and bottom of your finished heart. Drawing the Crack Create a jagged edge down one half of your heart. Start at top of one of your heart halves, where you left a small gap. Then, create a jagged edge that extends downwards towards the tail of that half, where it normally would meet in a point. This should create a separate half, complete with a jagged edge.
