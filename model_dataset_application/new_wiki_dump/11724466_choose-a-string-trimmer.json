          "description":"If you live on a large piece of property, then a corded trimmer won't reach as far as you need it to. A cordless trimmer, either gas or battery-powered, is better in this case. Both are mobile and ideal for trimming large properties. If you have a larger property, you can still use a corded trimmer. Just get an extension cord. A cordless trimmer is also helpful if you have a lot of obstructions in your yard like flower beds or furniture. Maneuvering the cord around will be difficult. Battery-powered trimmers usually only hold about 30 minutes of power before needing a recharge. If your property is large enough that you\u2019ll be trimming for longer than that, then a gas-powered model is best. You can get a higher-voltage battery that will make a battery-powered trimmer last longer. Keep in mind that this battery will be more expensive to buy and replace."

          "headline":"Choose a gas or battery trimmer if you have thick foliage in your yard.",
          "description":"Some trimmer types are more powerful than others, making them more suited to some jobs. Battery and gas-powered models are much stronger. They can handle cutting thick grass, weeds, and shrubs. If you have this type of foliage in your yard, then use a battery or gas model. Corded electric trimmers are the weakest, and work best for edging lawns and cutting grass. If this is all you'll be using your trimmer for, then it's the best option. Gas and battery-powered models are similar in strength, so consider other features to decide between the two. Black & Decker and Toro produce quality electric trimmers, both corded and battery-powered. For good gas-powered brands, look for Stihl, Craftsman, and Echo."

          "headline":"Go with a corded electric trimmer for the cheapest option.",
          "description":"Trimmers can range from under $100 to several hundred, so budgeting is important. Corded electric trimmers are the cheapest option, ranging from about $50-120. If you have a small property, then there\u2019s no need to spend more than this for a more powerful model. Black & Decker produces quality, affordable corded trimmers. This is a good brand to start with. Gas-powered trimmers range from $100-300 or more, depending on the engine type. You also need to spend money on gas and oil for it. Battery-powered trimmers are similar in price to gas-powered ones, about $100-300. Also remember that replacement batteries can cost over $100."

          "headline":"Get a corded-electric trimmer for the lowest-maintenance option.",
          "description":"Each trimmer type has different maintenance needs, which affect the effort and cost of owning them. Corded electric trimmers are the lowest-maintenance. They require basically no other upkeep besides replacing the string when it runs out. If you don't want to spend a lot of time and money maintaining your trimmer, then go with a corded electric. These trimmers are also less durable than the other ones, so they may not last as long. However, if you only trim short grass and edge lawns, you're not putting much stress on the trimmer."

If you're planning on making a long-term investment or use your trimmer for commercial landscaping, then one of these options is the best choice. Weigh the maintenance costs associated with each type to decide which is best for you. Battery-powered trimmers require regular battery charging, which can take over an hour. Further, batteries need replacement every 5 years or so, and new batteries can cost $100. Gas-powered trimmers need the most maintenance. They need new oil every 6 months, plus refueling when they\u2019re empty. You also need to keep the engine and motor clean to prevent grease buildup. These trimmers also last the longest, however, and should still be working in 10 years."

          "description":"Some gas trimmer brands make models with 2 or 4-stroke engines. The major difference between these is that a 4-stroke engine has greater fuel efficiency and produces less emissions. It also runs more quietly so you can avoid disturbing your neighbors. On the other hand, 2-stroke models are lighter and easier to handle. They also require less maintenance because the engine is less complex. If you want to try different types, look for a Husqvarna, Stihl, MTD, or Craftsman. These brands produce quality products with either engine variety, so you can try out different types to make your decision."

Some local governments have laws against noise and emissions, so check if your town has any limitations like these. If so, use a battery or corded trimmer to avoid breaking laws. Many towns have laws about using loud power tools early in the morning or late at night. As long as you trim during the day, you shouldn\u2019t be violating any laws."

With a tap-release, you\u2019d bump the trimmer head on the ground to release more string. This gives you more control over how much string you\u2019re using, but also requires more skill to operate. An automatic-release lets out more string whenever it needs to, meaning you don\u2019t have to do it manually. This lets you focus only on trimming. The release mechanism, however, requires more maintenance and might need periodic tune-ups."

You can also edge with a trimmer that doesn\u2019t have an adjustable head. It\u2019ll just take more practice to master the motion. If you\u2019re only edging your lawn, then an edging tool would be better than a string trimmer. These make straighter lines and require less skill to operate."

To avoid this inconvenience, get a model where the shaft connects directly to the head without any gap. If you\u2019re on a budget and don\u2019t have a large property, then getting a model with a gap should work fine. Just be prepared to pull debris out of the gap periodically. Turn the trimmer off before doing this."

For the safest options, look for a trimmer with a large shield that will block any kickback. This is especially important if you have gravel or a lot of small debris on your property. Even small rocks can do a lot of damage if the trimmer kicks them up. Remember that even with a large shield, you could still get hit with debris. Always wear goggles when operating the trimmer."

If it feels too heavy to operate properly, then look for another model. Corded trimmers are the lightest options. If you don\u2019t have enough strength to maneuver a heavy trimmer, then this is probably the best option. Remember that you\u2019ll be holding the trimmer for 10-20 minutes if you\u2019re working in a normal yard. It might not feel heavy initially, but after some time your muscles will get tired."

Hold the trimmer the way you would if you were using it, and make sure you can comfortably touch the ground with it. If you have to bend down to touch the ground, or lean back to prevent it from hitting the ground, then look for a model that fits you better. If you\u2019re taller, a straight shaft will help you reach the ground better. If you\u2019re shorter, than a curved shaft is probably easier to handle. Some trimmers have an adjustable height.
