      "description":"Hold the S key (S for \"start\") to start the engine. Like turning a key in a car, it takes a few seconds for it to \"catch\", and once the engine starts purring, you can safely let go of the key. FlightGear offers in-game flight tutorials, but for quick reference, the most basic controls are as follows \u2014 \nThe space bar starts the engine on a prop engine aircraft (it's usually on when FlightGear starts), Page Up increases throttle, Page Down decreases throttle, the up and down arrows control the elevator, the left and right arrows control the ailerons, and 0 and Enter (on NumPad) control the rudder. If you have difficulty, click Help, then Basic aircraft controls. Note that, again, FlightGear is designed for realism, and the controls are highly responsive, but also highly sensitive, which can prove quite daunting for the inexperienced flyer. It'll take a while to get the hang of flying, or even just taxiing around the airport, but the views are worth it."
