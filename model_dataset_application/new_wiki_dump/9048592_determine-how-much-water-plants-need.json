For example, if a plant is native to a tropical region and you live in a semi-arid environment, you\u2019ll need to provide a lot more water to it than to plants that are native to your region. If you're in a dry location (like the desert Southwest), provide more water to fruit and vegetable bearing plants than you would native plants. In addition, give more water to ferns and non-native flowering plants. If you're in a tropical environment, you may not need to provide any extra water to fruit and vegetable bearing plants. If you're in a temperate environment, research the specific plant (especially if it is fruit or vegetable bearing) to verify it gets enough water."

For the first week, provide water every other day. After the first week, monitor the plant closely to make sure the soil stays damp. Provide extra water if the soil is dry. at all times.

Maggie Moran\t\t\tHorticulturist\t\t\t\tDid You Know? Potted plants often require more frequent watering since the soil in pots tends to dry out faster. Ideally, you want the soil to be moist to a depth of about 1 inch (2.5 cm) at all times, which might require watering once or twice a day in drier climates."
