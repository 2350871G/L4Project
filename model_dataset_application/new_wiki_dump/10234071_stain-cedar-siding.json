Check the cedar\u2019s moisture content even if it has been protected from the weather. It shouldn\u2019t need extensive surface examination if it was well sheltered, but it never hurts to look for moisture before staining. The moisture content should not reach above 20%. Any contaminants must be removed in the event that the cedar was affected. You may want to do some surface preparation with smooth-planed, flat-grained cedar. A flat-grained wood surface should be scuffed-sanded with 50-60 grit sandpaper in order to increase the coating\u2019s performance while still maintaining a smooth appearance. Clean-textured cedar does not require surface preparation."

Moisture in the wood could make the staining less affective. Limit sun exposure and work in the shade when you\u2019re staining your cedar. The sun heats up the surface of the wood and dries the stain too quickly. This means that the stains won\u2019t penetrate the wood, and it will form a film on the surface and then peel.

Paint and stain brushes are made with acrylic or natural bristles. Use a wide brush for covering larger areas at once, but it won\u2019t allow for as much control as a smaller brush does.
