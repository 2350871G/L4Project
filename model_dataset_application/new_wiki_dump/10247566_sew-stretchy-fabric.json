If you are worried about damaging the stretch fabric you are using, then choose a ballpoint needle. Choose a fine (thin) needle for tightly woven knits and a thick needle for loosely woven knits. Ballpoint needles come in sizes 10 US (70 European) through 16 US (100 European). A smaller number indicates a finer needle, while a larger number indicates a thicker needle."

This type of needle helps to avoid skipped stitches on more delicate stretchy fabrics. Select a fine (thin) needle for tightly-woven fabrics and a thick needle for loosely-woven fabrics.

If you need a sewing machine needle that is extra fine (lower number needle size) or a needle that is extra thick (higher number needle size) and it is not available in a specialty needle, then you may have to get a universal needle. Universal needles range in size from US size 8 (European 60) to US size 19 (European 120). Choose a mid-range sized needle, such as a 14 US (90 European), if you are unsure of what size you need for your fabric."

Select your sewing machine\u2019s baste stitch setting or set the straight stitch to the longest length, and then sew the areas of the stretch fabric you want to secure. If they do not look right to you, then you can simply pull the end of the baste stitch thread to remove it from the fabric and try again.

Check to see if your machine does and follow your machine\u2019s instructions for how to set it to the stretch stitch. Most modern sewing machines have a stretch stitch setting, but your machine may not have this setting if it is an older model. Keep in mind that the stretch stitch setting creates stitches that are very difficult to remove if you make a mistake, so baste first and sew carefully!"

The straight stitch may also work for some stretch fabrics, but you might want to test it on a scrap of your stretchy fabric first to be sure. Check your sewing machine\u2019s instruction manual for how to set it to the zigzag or straight stitch setting."

This type of stitching is known as an overedge stitch and it is a great way to keep your hems and seams stretchy. Some more advanced sewing machines might include an overedge stitch setting, so check your sewing machine\u2019s instruction manual if you\u2019d like to try this stitch without a serger."

If you have a machine with a digital interface and a stretch stitch setting, then it should automatically adjust the stitch length. If you have a machine with dials that requires you to adjust the stitch length manually, then you will need to do this no matter what type of stitch you use."

This will make it easier to remove the pins before you sew over each section."

To avoid this, you can sew a non-stretchy stabilizing fabric into the shoulder seams. Use a 0.75 in (1.9 cm) piece of lightweight, non-stretch fabric, such as silk organza or cotton, cut to the length you need to cover the seam. The stabilizing fabric should be even with the edge of the stretch fabric so that you sew through the stabilizing fabric and stretch fabric at the same time.
