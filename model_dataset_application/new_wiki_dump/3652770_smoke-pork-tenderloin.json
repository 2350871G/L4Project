          "description":"For the best flavor, you want to season the pork tenderloin prior to smoking it. Depending on your preference, you can use a dry rub or a marinade to help make the pork more flavorful. Prepared rubs or marinades are a good option if you\u2019re in a hurry, but you can also create your own with your favorite spices and ingredients to pair with pork tenderloin. For a tasty dry rub for your pork tenderloin, mix together 1 \u00bc cup brown sugar, \u2154 cup sugar, 3 tablespoons black pepper, 2 tablespoons kosher salt, 2 tablespoons ground ginger, 4 \u00bd teaspoons garlic powder, 4 \u00bd teaspoons onion salt, 1 tablespoon dry mustard, 1 \u00bd teaspoons cayenne pepper, 1 \u00bd teaspoons crushed red pepper, 1 \u00bd teaspoons ground cumin, 1 \u00bd teaspoons paprika, and \u00be teaspoon dried thyme. To make a good basic marinade for a pork tenderloin, combine a \u00bd teaspoon of minced garlic, \u00bc cup of cola, \u00bc cup of dark brown sugar, \u00bc cup of soy sauce, \u00bd teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of ground pepper, 1 teaspoon minced onion, and 3 tablespoons of olive oil."

          "description":"Before applying the rub or marinade to the tenderloin, you may want to cut it to ensure that the pieces will fit on the grill. If you\u2019re dealing with a tenderloin that\u2019s between 1 \u00bd and 3 pounds, cutting it in half is usually sufficient. For larger pieces of pork, you may need to cut into additional pieces. Pork tenderloins usually have a silvery-looking membrane known as the silverskin on the top of it. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut off the silverskin before applying the rub or marinade. You can also trim away any fat as desired."

          "headline":"Season the tenderloin.",
          "description":"Once the pork is properly cut, it\u2019s time to season the meat. You can apply a dry rub with your fingers, making sure to apply a generous amount and cover all sides of the tenderloin. For a marinade, you can use a pastry brush to cover the entire tenderloin with the mixture. Lightly scoring the tenderloin before you apply a dry rub can help the spices better penetrate the pork. When using a marinade, you can also place it in a plastic zipper bag, add the pork to it, and move the meat around inside to ensure that it is completely covered with the mixture."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Let the rub or marinade sit.",
          "description":"To ensure that the flavors really have time to penetrate the pork, allow the tenderloin to sit with the rub or marinade on it for some time before smoking it. You can wrap the pork in plastic wrap or place it inside a plastic bag and store it in the refrigerator until you\u2019re ready to cook it. With a rub, you can allow it to sit on the meat for 15 minutes to several hours. You may want to let a pork tenderloin in a marinade sit in the refrigerator overnight, but a few hours is usually sufficient. Make sure to keep the seasoned tenderloin refrigerated until it\u2019s time to smoke it. If you marinade has citrus in it, don\u2019t let it sit on the pork for more than two to three hours. Make sure to throw away any excess marinade that\u2019s still in the bag or dish after you remove the pork. It can contaminate other food if you reuse it."

          "description":"For the best smoking results, the wood that you use makes a big difference. Hickory, apple, cherry, and oak are all effective in helping give your pork a delicious smoky taste. You\u2019re also better off using wood chunks instead of chips because chunks are less likely to cause fire flare-ups. If you are using wood chips, soak them in water for at least an hour before putting them on the grill. Never use sap woods, such as pine for smoking.

Start by removing the grate and opening the grill\u2019s bottom damper. Place coals lit by chimney starter on top of it, making sure that they\u2019re all piled on one side of the grill. If you\u2019re using a gas grill, start the smoking process by preheating it to medium."

          "description":"It\u2019s important to add the wood chunks or chips to the grill when it\u2019s reached a temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 degrees Celsius). You can get the grill to the right temperature by gradually adding coals to continue to build up the heat. Once the grill is at the right temperature, place the wood directly on top of the coals. If your grill doesn\u2019t have a temperature gauge, you can test the temperature by holding your hand over the charcoal. If you can do it for three seconds or more, the grill needs additional coals. If it\u2019s too hot to keep your hand over the charcoal for more than two seconds, it\u2019s hot enough\nIf you\u2019re using a gas grill, put the wood in a smoker pouch or box inside the grill, set it to high until you see smoke, and then reduce the grill heat to medium."

It usually takes two and a half to three hours to smoke tenderloins that are approximately 1 \u00bd to 2 pounds. Make sure that the internal temperature of the pork is at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius) before you remove it from the grill. As a rule of thumb, it takes approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes per pound to smoke a pork tenderloin. Because you\u2019re cooking with indirect heat, there\u2019s no need to touch or move the meat during the heating process. With a charcoal grill, you will need to open the lid to add fresh lit coals during the smoking process to ensure that the temperature stays at 250 degrees. Use oven mitts to remove the tenderloin and the grate, add more hot charcoal, and then replace the grate and pork so you can close the lid as quickly as possible. A digital meat thermometer makes it easy to figure out if the pork is fully cooked."

If you want to give your tenderloin extra flavor, you can apply barbecue sauce or more of the marinade that you used right after it comes off the grill and it\u2019s still hot.
