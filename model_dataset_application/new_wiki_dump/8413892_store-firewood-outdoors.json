Avoid covering both kinds with a tarp. The more air exposure wood has, the faster it will dry. Covering wood with a tarp may prolong the time it takes to dry and could cause mold to grow. \"Green wood\" means it has been freshly cut and still has green sap in it. This wood can take from several months to a year to dry. For the best and quickest results, cut the wood and store it where it will be protected from wetness. \"Seasoned wood\" means the green sap in the wood has already dried.
