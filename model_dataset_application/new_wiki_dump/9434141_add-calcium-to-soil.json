The amount of additive you need to apply will depend largely on your needs and your soil pH level. Research your needs before determining the amount you want to use. If you are using lime, till it into the soil so that it mixes in thoroughly. If you are using gypsum, spread it over the surface of the soil and then water it in until the soil absorbs it."
