Here's how:\nRow 1: Loosely cast on 16 stitches, place marker, cast on a further 16 stitches (32 stitches in total). Row 2: Knit on the wrong side (WS). Row 3: Decrease row. Knit until you are 2 stitches before the marker. Knit the next two stitches together through the back of the loop, move marker, knit two stitches together and then knit to the end of the row (RS). Row 4: Knit WS. Repeat rows 3 and 4 until you are left with just 2 stitches on the needle (WS), pass the left stitch over the right stitch so you have just one stitch left and then fasten off."

Look at your square as a diamond with the top point being where you finished knitting and fastened off.
