  "text":" Preparation Fill in the gasoline tank with ordinary gasoline.  Select a torch  and cutting nozzle according to your cutting task.  Fasten the nozzle with a pair of wrenches.  Connect the fuel hose (gasoline hose) properly with a pair of wrenches.  Connect the oxygen hose properly with a pair of wrenches.  Open the valve of oxygen cylinder. Adjust the oxygen pressure regulator, set the secondary gauge to the required oxygen pressure according to the task. Open the gasoline outlet valve on the gasoline tank slowly.  Purge the preheat oxygen line and the cutting oxygen line.  Ignition Open the preheat oxygen valve on the torch, oxygen should flow out from the cutting tip.  Open the gasoline valve on the torch. Increase the gasoline flow gradually until a mist sprays out from the cutting nozzle and light it. Heat the nozzle:  in a cold environment, it is advised to heat the cutting tip for a few seconds to obtain a stable working flame.  Adjust the flame until it is balanced by tuning the torch gasoline valve and preheat oxygen valve.  Cutting Hold the flame near the steel (keep the nozzle 3-5mm away from the steel surface) and preheat the steel for 3-5 seconds.  Open the cutting oxygen valve and start cutting.  Shut down Shut the cutting oxygen valve, then the torch gasoline valve. Make sure the flame dies out. Close preheat oxygen valve on the torch.  Check to make sure the gasoline outlet valve on the tank and the master valve on the oxygen bottle are closed. ",
