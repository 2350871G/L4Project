Cut it out. You can use your cutting tool that you will use later, or scissors. Creating the Lens Cap Apply the tape that you are using. Stick it to the inside of the circle that you cut out earlier. Stick a piece of tape across the other side of the circle that you just taped. You want it to stick out on either side of the circle about an inch and a half (2.5-3cm) or so. Start attaching the already taped scored piece of foamcore, as shown in the image, gently curving it around to fit on the circle piece. Cut the piece of tape that is still jutting out along its center. Cut right to where it joins the foamcore.
