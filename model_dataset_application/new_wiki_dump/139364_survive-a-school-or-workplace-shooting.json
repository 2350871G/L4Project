          "description":"Prepare in advance by identifying all exits from the rooms where you spend the most time. This includes emergency exits, fire escapes, and windows. Ideally, plan at least two escape routes out of the school or workplace, in case the shooter is blocking one of them. Don't rule out second-story windows, or windows that you would have to break. You can survive cuts from broken glass or a broken leg from a fall. 98% of shooters act alone. If you can avoid the area where you hear gunfire, you are usually safe.Warning: Do not pull the fire alarm, even as an attempt to evacuate others. The evacuation procedures for a fire and an active shooter are completely different, and pulling the fire alarm can increase the risk of casualties as a result."

These tactics only matter if the shooter is aiming directly at you, and using a weapon with a low rate of fire. Getting away fast is usually the better option. The one exception is a situation where you are forced to run within sight of the shooter, in an area with plenty of cover between you and the exit.

The shooter will pull the trigger and the gun will fire, but only once because the hand covering the ejection port will cause a malfunction and the weapon will not cycle another round. That weapon is now a useless hunk of metal until the shooter can clear and cycle another round in manually (perfect opportunity for you to take the weapon away and subdue the shooter)."

Lock the door, place a doorstop on it, and place all heavy furniture like desks and chairs in front of the door immediately to deter the shooter. If the shooter is approaching, get away from the door as soon as you can. Stay away from all doors and windows. If the door opens to the outside, a barricade will only delay the shooter for a moment.
