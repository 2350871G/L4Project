          "description":"Tiebacks come in a nearly endless variety of styles. If your curtains are a solid color, you can choose tiebacks that are the same color or a complimentary shade. If you have patterned curtains, try choosing tiebacks that have one or more colors that are present in the patterns. You can purchase tiebacks anywhere home furnishings are sold. They can range anywhere from $3.00-$25.00 USD apiece, depending on the style you choose."

If you're using your curtains as decorative panels, it's okay if they don't cover the entire window. Create a look that you like! Just make sure your curtains have enough fabric that they don't look too bare when you tie them back."

          "description":"Most curtain tiebacks are located between halfway and 2/3rds of the way down a curtain, and about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the edge of the window. For very tall windows, such as two-story windows, you may need to place your tiebacks based on how the curtains look as well as where you can reach to adjust them. You may need to lower the tiebacks to make them more accessible."

Simple hooks usually cost around $0.50 and can be purchased at any hardware store. For heavy tiebacks or tassels with 2 loops, you may need a larger hook. The hook should be hidden by the curtain."
