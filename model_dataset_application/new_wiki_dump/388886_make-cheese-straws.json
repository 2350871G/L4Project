          "description":"Leave your butter and cheese on the counter for a few hours to soften them. Once they are softened, put them in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and cheese together until they look like cream cheese. This should take about 15-30 minutes. This is easiest if you have a standing mixer. This allows you to leave the mixture to beat instead of holding a hand mixer."

Beat every time you add more flour. Add the remaining flour to the mixture until it is somewhat stiff but still pliable. You may not need to use all of the flour. If the mixture gets to this point before you use the whole cup, stop adding the flour."

Flatten them into the shape of a straw with a fork, making long stripes down the side of them with the fork. Place them on the baking sheets until you have used all the dough. If you have a cookie press, attach the star tip. Put part of the dough into the cookie press. Push out long strips of the dough onto each of the baking sheets until they are filled and the dough is gone. This recipe yields 4 dozen. If you want to make less, cut the recipe in half to make 2 dozen."
