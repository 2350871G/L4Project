  "text":" Steps Identify the cheater. Someone who chips the ball is not a cheater. Chipping the ball behind/around the goal to confuse the goalkeeper is a move tricksters will frequently use, but it is not cheating. The move is not \"cheap\" either because it usually takes a decent amount of skill to score a goal using chip-tricks. A cheater is a player who takes advantage of glitches in the game, the most common being the Boo-Goalie glitch where Boo disappears into the goalie and the team that made the Boo disappear into the goalie skips the charging phase and can score incredibly cheap goals. Learn the most common cheat, that being the one described above. It is good for fighting back against a cheater. To use this cheat you must have a Boo on your team. Cheat #1 Gain possession of the ball. First, with possession of the ball, move Boo next to your own goalkeeper. Charge the ball to its maximum before it must be released.  Then, before it is shot/passed, use Boo's deke to disappear into the goalie's arms. He will take the ball from your Boo. Throw the ball to a good passer, maybe even the same Boo.  Pass the ball down field without charging it to a powerful player.  Shoot the ball, and if done correctly, the ball (even if completely uncharged) will pass right through the opposing goalie. This can be done with a balanced player or even a weak shooter as well, but it does not work correctly as often. Cheat #2 With Boo, take the ball to the opposing goalie. Charging the ball has no effect on the outcome of this move. When you get close enough, the goalie will attempt to lunge at or hit you in an effort to take the ball. Just before he does this, use Boo's deke to disappear. You have a tiny window of opportunity to score just after doing this because (with good timing) you will have passed right through the goalie. If you wait more than a split second to shoot, the goalie will recover and take the ball. Alternatively, as opposed to shooting the ball just after disappearing you can also chip it in. Chipping makes it harder for the goalie to take, but if done at an odd angle (such as from the side) it won't work since chips are not guided automatically towards the goal like shots are. This move is used frequently on Wi-Fi as well. It is best to just let the goalie handle it, he can stop it sometimes. Or you may have a player just behind the goalie hit the Boo passing through him, thus stopping the ball. (If done from a bad angle, you may actually end up knocking the ball into your own goal!) Defending Against Cheaters Learn that there are ways to combat the cheats. If you are unwilling to cheat to beat a cheater, you must be aware that there are ways to stop cheats from working. For the first cheat, the most obvious thing to do it hit the Boo or steal the ball as soon as you see it make a move towards its own goalie.  You can also attack all the power players downfield to minimize the chance of scoring even if the cheat works (weaker characters shots are much slower and the cheat sometimes wears off before the ball reaches the goalie).  There is no real way to stop the second cheat other than to just let the goalie handle it.  If the third move is used against you, have a player behind the goalie and press A to deflect the chip shot. Players use this move extremely often and the goalie cannot block the very high shots about half the time, so it is a good idea to always have at least one fast/good passing player deep in your own territory solely for this purpose.",
