If you are working with a delicate fabric such as chiffon, lace, or silk, choose a thin needle and correspondingly thin thread. If you are working with a heavier fabric, such as denim or canvas, you will need a thick needle and thick thread. If the seam will be visible, be sure to choose a color corresponding to the surrounding fabric."

If necessary, wet the end of the thread before passing through the head of the needle. You can either loop a single piece of thread through the eye of the needle, or two ends of the thread to create a thicker sewing tool. As can be expected, a thicker gathering of thread will be better for heavy-duty fabrics."

          "description":"Different stitches work well for different fabrics and problems. A simple whip stitch is wonderful for delicate fabric, while a running stitch will do well with a sturdy fabric. If you are dealing with an exposed seam, a backstitch will provide a discreet means of repair. If you are a beginner, a running stitch is likely to be the easiest option, as it involves going in a single, straight line. A backstitch is another good beginner option. To backstitch, push your needle through the fabric, pull your thread all the way through, and push your needle up through the bottom of the fabric \u00bc an inch (.635 cm), before placing your needle at your starting point and pulling the thread all the way through again. Continue this process to create a clean backstitch."

Try to keep your stitches as even and uniform as possible, favoring a tighter stitch rather than a loose one. While a loose stitch will be faster and easier, you run the risk of the repaired seam weakening and reopening quickly."

If your knot is too loose, your newly-repaired seam may begin to unravel, while a tight knot may cause snagging. Smooth the fabric to make sure there are no wrinkles or problems, then tie a knot to lie flush against the fabric. Tying the knot will be easier if you keep the needle intact and pull the needle through the loop you\u2019ve made for your knot. This is especially true if you have only an inch or so of extra thread."

If you do find a snag, use a seam-ripper to remove your thread, and start again. While you do want to check to make sure your seam is solid, avoid yanking on the seam, as this can damage even the most well-constructed item of clothing."
