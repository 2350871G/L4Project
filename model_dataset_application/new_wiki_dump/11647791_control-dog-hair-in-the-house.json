          "description":"Use your grooming brush to groom your dog regularly. Starting at their neck, gently brush away from their head and towards their tail. Cover each area 3-4 times to ensure that you lift out any loose furs. Gently brush the top of their head and around their hindquarters. If your dog has a thick coat on their belly, gently brush from the base of the neck towards the back of their underbelly. Keep a garbage can or plastic bag nearby so that you can empty your brush once it accumulates a large amount of fur. If you have a long-haired breed, brush your dog\u2019s coat once every 4-7 days. Short-haired breeds tend to do just fine with a biweekly grooming. It may seem like you\u2019re making the shedding problem worse if you brush your dog\u2019s coat and haven\u2019t done it for a while. Stick with it. Over time, you\u2019ll notice less hair floating around in your home."

          "description":"The type of brush you use is essential to achieving positive results when you brush your pup. A bristle brush works best to remove thinner hair without sending it flying all over the place. As you brush, the stiff bristles with pick up loose hairs and smaller clumps of hair. Use a bristle brush designed specifically for dogs. A human hair brush tends to be too stiff and the bristles tend to be too short for most dogs."

          "description":"A slicker brush has thin, flexible bristles with beads at the end for collecting large clumps of hair. This makes it ideal for breeds with longer hair since the beads at the bottom of each bristle massage the roots of the hair as you brush your dog. A slicker brush is also ideal for breeds with wiry or soft hair. For mixed-breed dogs and mutts, assess the hair on your own by running your fingers through it. The length will tell you if your dog has long or short hair. The texture will let you know if it\u2019s wiry, silky, or standard. If your wrist gets tired by all of the brushing, get a handheld dog comb with the same type of bristles as your normal brush. These combs wrap around your hand with a strap and make it easier to maintain control while you comb."

          "description":"A periodic puppy bath does wonders for shedding, since the water and shampoo strengthen the dog\u2019s hair while washing out dead strands. Take your dog to the tub once every 2-4 months and use a dog shampoo to lather their body\u2019s fur. Use warm water to wash your dog by hand or use a sponge. Rinse and dry your dog thoroughly. Once dry, brush their hair to remove any remaining strands of loose fur.Warning: Do not use human shampoo on a dog. Human shampoo has the wrong pH balance and uses scented chemicals that aren\u2019t safe for dogs. Human shampoo is more likely to cause an allergic reaction or dry your dog\u2019s skin out. Stick with shampoos that are specifically designed for dogs. Keep water off of the dog\u2019s face and out of their eyes. Not only will water in the face fail to help clean them, it can irritate the most sensitive features on their body. If your dog hates baths, reward them with treats for getting into the tub, sitting still, and drying off. Over time, as they get used to baths, slowly taper off your treats until they\u2019re comfortable with baths. If you notice your dog\u2019s skin start to dry out, see them scratching more frequently than they normally do, or it feels like their fur is thinner than it should be, cut back on the baths. Excessive bathing can dry a dog\u2019s skin out."

          "description":"If you can afford regular trips to the groomer, taking your dog to get cleaned up, trimmed, and bathed is a great way to ensure that they aren\u2019t shedding a lot at home. A professional groomer will do a phenomenal job of getting rid of excess fur and prevent long hairs from falling out in the near future by trimming them back. The price of a dog groomer\u2019s services varies based on their status and the services you request. Larger dogs with thicker hair also cost more to groom than smaller dogs with thinner coats. If money is not an issue, taking your dog to get groomed once every 4-6 weeks is the ideal way to avoid shedding in the house."

Then, roll the cylinder at the end of the handle into the dirty surface by dragging it back and forth like you\u2019re vacuuming.Tip: Lint rollers aren\u2019t particularly expensive. Buy them in bulk and store them in your entryway or closet so that you always have a spare ready to go.

If your food is higher or lower than that in protein and fat, try changing your brand of dog food to see if your dog stops shedding as much. For breeds that naturally shed a lot, changing the diet won\u2019t really help, but if your dog is shedding more than they should be, this is a great solution.
