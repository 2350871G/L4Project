          "description":"If this is your first time attempting to create an ambigram then choosing a word on the shorter side is a good idea. If you want to try something more advanced, pick a longer word. Longer words pose more challenges as there are simply more letters that need to be made to look like each other. For example, a nice simple word to choose might be \"BOOK\" as it is only 4 letters. A more difficult word might be \"TELEVISION\" as it has 10 letters. Often, people will choose their name if they\u2019re designing an ambigram for personal reasons so this is also an option."

          "description":"Just do this on a piece of paper with a pencil. Write it so that the one spelling of the word is directly above the other spelling of the word. This will make it easier to analyze the word later on. For example, if your word was \u2018great\u2019, write it out on a piece of paper and then directly below it write \u2018taerg\u2019 lined up letter-for-letter with the forward spelling. It\u2019s also a good idea to write your word out upside down and in lower and upper case. This lets you look at what letters may transform well into other letters. This process is the same regardless of whether you are creating a reversal ambigram or an upside-down ambigram as at the moment, you are just getting clear on which letters must transform into each other."

          "headline":"Line up the two spellings of the word and connect the letters with lines.",
          "description":"One spelling of the word (forward or backward) should be on top of the other to make this much easier. Make sure you are drawing lines down connecting letters from the regularly spelled word to the backward spelled word. For example, for the word \u201cgreat\u201d you would connect \u2018g\u2019 with \u2018t\u2019 with a straight line, then \u2018r\u2019 with \u2018a\u2019, then \u2018e\u2019 with \u2018e\u2019. Another example might be with the word \u201csunflower\u201d. You would connect the \u2018s\u2019 to the \u2018r\u2019 and then the \u2018u\u2019 to the \u2018e\u2019 then the \u2018n\u2019 to the \u2018w\u2019 and so forth.

Stick with just pairing individual letters up together if you want to keep it simple. An example of how this works is that in the word \u2018great\u2019 the letter \u2018g\u2019 pairs up with \u2018t\u2019 (as these are the first and last letters). However, if you wanted to combine the letters, you might make it so the letter \u2018g\u2019 pairs up with the letters \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018t\u2019. This would mean that the letter \u2018g\u2019 will turn into \u2018at\u2019 when viewed from the alternative angle because you have combined the 'a' and the 't'. Combining letters is a bit more complicated so if you're just starting out, stick to just transforming 1 letter at a time."
