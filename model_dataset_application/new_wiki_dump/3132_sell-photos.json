          "description":"Pull together a few of your very best shots for your portfolio. Make sure to select images that you\u2019re happy with and that you feel are representative of the work you do. Whether you\u2019re offering your services as a professional photographer or just trying to sell photos you\u2019ve snapped on your own, a portfolio is a great way to show off your work. If you\u2019re not comfortable making your own website, use a portfolio website like PhotoShelter, Squarespace, or SmugMug. You may need to pay a monthly fee to use these services. Building a portfolio is also a good way to define your niche as a photographer. For example, you might focus on beefing up your reputation as someone who takes breathtaking nature photos or mouthwatering food pictures."

          "description":"You can use a service like Facebook or start a dedicated blog to post pictures and talk about your photography. Once you start building a following, you can use your social media platform to let people know where they can purchase your photos. Many social media sites will promote your content for a fee. For example, you can use the \u201cSponsored Posts\u201d feature on LinkedIn or click \u201cBoost Post\u201d on Facebook to advertise your work to a larger audience. Reach out to friends and family and ask them to spread the word about your work through their own social media accounts. Try making chatty posts that give your followers an idea of who you are as a person as well as an artist. For example, \u201cI had a wonderful time connecting with the ancient past\u2014and with myself\u2014during my recent trip to Egypt! Check out these images I captured of Hatshepsut\u2019s temple at Deir el-Bahri, available for sale on my website now.\u201d"

Setting an appropriate price for your photos depends on a lot of factors, including the quality of the photo, the uniqueness of the composition and subject matter, and who is buying the picture. Consider the audience for your photos. If you\u2019re selling to individuals, you\u2019ll probably make a lot less than you would selling your photos to a big-budget magazine or website. You can use online tools like Getty Image\u2019s price calculator to help you find a reasonable price range for your image based on factors like how the photo will be used and the nature of your target market. Apps like price-a-photo by Pixel Cents can also simplify the pricing process."

Making your own store will give you complete control over how you price, license, and deliver your photos to customers. Services like Shopify and Yahoo! Stores offer easy ways to set up your own storefront with lots of convenient built-in features (such as customer mailing lists and secure payment systems).

Each vendor has different pricing and licensing policies, so shop around to find the one that fits your needs. Many of these services require a monthly subscription fee for hosting and selling your photos, so you will probably need to post a lot of photos in order to make a profit. Most stock photo agencies offer either a percentage or a flat fee for the sale of each photo. Fees may vary depending on the size or resolution of the photo and how the buyer plans to use it. While smaller agencies may let you start submitting photos right away, some of the larger ones (like Getty) have a more selective and complicated review process."

You can sell high-quality prints through websites like Fine Art America, or put your designs on merchandise like shirts and buttons using custom vendors like CafePress or Zazzle. If you make your own prints or other products featuring your photographs, Etsy is a good option that allows you to keep a generous percentage of the profits."
