Alternatively, pour sangria into individual glasses and top them off with seltzer or sparkling water. You can choose from flavored or plain sparkling water or seltzer. Making Hot Sangria Pour a bottle of red wine in a pot of slow cooker. Red wine is best for making hot sangria, so avoid using a white wine for this recipe. Choose a bottle with fruity undertones to complement the fruit you\u2019ll add. Pour the entire bottle into a large pot or saucepan or into a slow cooker or crock pot. This recipe serves 8. Add 3 cups (710 mL) of cider or juice and 0.5 cups (120 mL) of liquor. You can use apple cider and rum, or cranberry juice or orange juice and brandy. Adjust the amounts of cider or juice and liquor based on how strong or weak you like your sangria. Pour the cider or juice and liquor into the pot to meld with the wine.

Mix and match the spices to your liking, or add 2-3 tablespoons (1-1.5 g) of mulling spices, instead. Give everything a good stir after adding the spices to the pot. Put chopped fruit in the pot. Pick at least 1 citrus fruit (like orange or lemon) and 1 non-citrus fruit (like cranberries or apples). Add 1 cup (128 g) of chopped fruit to the pot. Heat the mixture for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Turn on the burner or slow cooker to low heat and allow the mixture to simmer. Stir it occasionally to help all the flavors blend together. To keep it warm throughout the evening, let it continue to simmer on low, stirring occasionally. Take care not to let the mixture boil, or you could end up with a sticky mess. Pairing Sangria with Food Serve red wine sangria with spicy dishes. The rich, fruitiness of red wine sangria perfectly balances spicy dishes. Serve sangria with chorizo, albondigas, or chilaquiles. The sweetness of the sangria will balance out the spiciness of the dish. Pair white wine sangria with seafood. Seafood wonderfully complements the cool sweetness of white wine sangria. Serve it with calamari, scallops, or mussels. Enjoy ros\u00e9 sangria with a fruit and cheese plate. Select fruits that will match or complement the ones you put in your sangria, such as pears, figs, apples, or strawberries. Choose cheeses like brie, Roquefort, gorgonzola, and goat cheese. Don\u2019t forget to add some crackers, too! Try hot sangria with mole. The spices and complex flavors in hot sangria pair well with rich and spicy foods like mole. A pepper and chocolate mole would be a great complement to hot sangria made with red wine and oranges. Eat dessert with your sangria. The sweetness of sangria makes it a great drink to have with dessert. A fruity dessert, such as a fresh berry tart, baked apples, or poached pears in wine are perfect pairings.",
