  "text":" Positioning the Tie Choose a plain tie for an Eldredge knot. A striped or high-contrast, patterned tie won\u2019t look good with an Eldredge knot. Because there are so many folds in the knot, a striped or patterned tie will just look like a jumbled mess. Solid colored ties are the best option for an Eldredge knot. Drape the tie around your open collar. Make sure you have your collar raised when you drape the tie around your neck. Let the tie hang so that the wide end is on your right and the narrow end is on your left. Make sure the seams are facing inward. Adjust the tie so that the wide end is hanging down where you want it when you finish. Most people prefer the tip of the tie to hang just above the waistline. Cross the narrow end over the front of the wide end. Start by pinching the wide end with your left hand to make a dimple. Then, when pulling the narrow end across, try to make it as perpendicular to the wide end as you can, so that you end up with a cross shape. You don\u2019t need to move the wide end of the tie when tying an Eldredge Knot. Wrap the narrow end around the back of the wide end. When wrapping the narrow end behind the wide end from right to left, make it as perpendicular to the wide end as you can. Pinching the spot where the narrow end crossed over the front of the wide end will help you keep the crossing tight. Practice in front of a mirror so you can see your progress from another angle. Tying the Knot Raise the narrow end of the tie over the collar loop on your left side. The collar loop is the part of the tie that wraps around your collar. Raise the narrow end up so that is in front of the collar loop and pointing toward your face. Thread the narrow end behind the collar loop on the tie\u2019s right side. Make it so the narrow end of the tie is on your right side when you finish this step. Position the narrow end so that it is facing outward. Cross the narrow end over the wide end. Make the narrow end as horizontal as possible when crossing. Double check to make sure there is no slack in tie at this point. Push the narrow end up and behind the loop around your neck. Squeeze the narrow end behind your collar loop. As you pull it through the loop, make it so that the inside of the tie is facing outward. Tighten the tie to get rid of any slack. Bring the narrow end of the tie down over the right side of the knot. Pull the narrow end of the tie down so that it is snug against the knot. Make it form a diagonal band running from the left down to the right over the knot. Loop the narrow end around the knot and through the diagonal band. Guide the narrow end behind the knot to the left. Then bring it back across toward the right side and over the knot. When crossing over the knot, weave the narrow end through the diagonal band. Pull the knot tight to create a diagonal band on the left side. Coil the narrow end around the right side of your collar loop. From the knot, raise the narrow end straight upward. Then, thread it down between your neck and the right side of your collar loop. The narrow end of your tie should end up on the right side of the tie with its inside facing outward. Bring the narrow end across the knot and through the collar loop. Aim the narrow end of the tie straight upwards. Then guide it between your neck and your collar loop down to the left side of your knot. The narrow end of your tie should be on your left side with its inside facing outward. Keep some slack in your tie at this stage. Take the narrow end through the loop you just made. Bring the narrow end toward your right, across the front of the knot. After going through the loop, tighten the knot. Adjust it so that the diagonal folds are even. Hide the remainder of the narrow end. Fold the rest of the narrow end over your collar loop. Then you can either tuck it behind the wide end of your tie or put it underneath the loop around your neck. You can tighten your tie by pulling on the wide end.",
