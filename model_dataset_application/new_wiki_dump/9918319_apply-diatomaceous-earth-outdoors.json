Wear a face mask to avoid inhaling the powder, and wear gloves on your hands so that the powder won\u2019t dry out your skin. If you don\u2019t have a face mask, you can also wear a bandana or towel over your mouth to keep out the dust."

This will help protect beneficial insects that you might have in your yard, such as bees. Apply it close to the ground, and avoid spreading it over flowers that are in bloom so that you don\u2019t harm bees."

To prevent your application from blowing around your yard, or out of your yard completely, wait until it\u2019s a calm day outside to spread it. If you have to spread it in light wind, opt for using a wet application to help keep the diatomaceous earth in place."

If it rains or is windy, wait until the weather dies down a bit and reapply just as you did the first time. It's okay to apply diatomaceous earth when the ground is wet after a rain shower, just make sure it's not going to rain heavily afterwards."
