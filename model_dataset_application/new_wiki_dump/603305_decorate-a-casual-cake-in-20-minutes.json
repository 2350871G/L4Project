      "headline":"Ice your cake.",
      "description":"Choose a type of icing which is suitable for your design. You can either ice the whole cake (top and sides) or just the top, either method can look good if done tidily. Add food dye or cocoa to your icing before putting it on your cake if you wish to change the colour. Adding lemon juice or flavouring to your icing won't change how it looks, but can make the cake taste much nicer."

Try to keep your message fairly sure, as writing on cake will be much larger than normal handwriting and is time consuming. You can use either writing icing or cake markers to write your message on the cake."
