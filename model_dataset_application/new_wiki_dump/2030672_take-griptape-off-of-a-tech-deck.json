  "text":" With a Blow Dryer Grab the tech deck.  Turn on the blow dryer. Put it on \"high\" and wait about five seconds for it to heat up. Point the blow dryer at the tech deck. Keep it here for about twenty seconds. This will melt the glue making the grip looser and easier to remove. Slowly, begin to peel off the griptape. Don't rip it off, just gently peel it back. The slower you do this, and the more care you take, the less griptape and glue will be left behind. If the griptape gets stuck, heat it again for about ten seconds and then try peeling it. Remove any excess glue or grip with a nail file or your fingers.  With Water Get a small tub.  Fill it with warm water. You want the water to be quite hot, but not boiling. Run the hot tap until it heats up then fill your container. Remove the trucks and wheels from your tech deck. These parts will rust in water so avoid putting these parts in. Soak the tech deck for about twenty to thirty seconds.  Remove the tech deck and peel the grip off. Again, very slowly. Remove any excess glue or grip with a nail file or your fingers. ",
