      "description":"You've probably seen them, the whole picture's black and white but certain things like a dress, or a rose or whatever. Take a picture that would be interesting to hand tint, get it printed on matte photo paper in black and white, then buy a cheap watercolor set (from dollar tree or somewhere) and pick parts out to paint. The more water you use the more see through the paint on the pictures will be, the less water the more the paint will be darker. You can even get a dual tone effect by picking one color to paint over the whole pick, but make sure its watery."
