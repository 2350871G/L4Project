Light squeezing or pinching of arms or legs. Taking hair accessories out of the hair. Tweaking a mustache or beard gently. Very gently pulling or twisting a nose. Making a funny face at the player, sticking fingers in your own ears and waggling your tongue, and so forth. Pounding your chest like a gorilla. Making bunny's ears over the player's head, etc."
