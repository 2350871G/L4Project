The purpose of this is to convert the measured interval length between spiral arms along the major axis of the galaxy into arc minutes. It is important to measure, or determine, this interval in arc minutes. And with a little algebra, this is very easy to do. You do not have to be a geek to do it."

      "description":"Luckily, a vast number of galaxies have had their rotation speeds measured and these can be found online. Look for galactic rotation profiles or rotation curves and find one for your galaxy. There is a way to find out how fast a galaxy is spinning using line widths, but that is not covered here. When and if you find your galaxy's rotation profile, it will be a graph of rotation velocity vs radial distance from the centre of the galaxy. The velocity of rotation will flatten out to some maximum velocity, almost always given in Kilometers per second (kps). You will need to measure this maximum rotational velocity as best you can in kps. Ignore every thing about dark matter; it is completely irrelevant."
