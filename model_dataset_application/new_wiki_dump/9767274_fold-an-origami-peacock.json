Fold the bottom half upwards so the bottom point meets the top point.  Take the top point and fold down and to the right, making a new triangle.  Fold the back right half of the paper back and to the left. As you fold the back portion to the back left, pull the tip of the far right triangle and flatten it out along the back side.
