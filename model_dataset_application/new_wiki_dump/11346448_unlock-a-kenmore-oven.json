          "description":"Many modern ovens, including Kenmore ovens, have a self-clean button on the display panel. Check it to see if it is lit up. When your oven is in this mode, it gets very hot and you won\u2019t be able to open the door. To deactivate it, hold the stop button down for at least 3 seconds. During self-cleaning, the oven heats to a high temperature to incinerate any debris inside of it. The door cannot be opened until the oven cools. You could choose to wait for the self-cleaning cycle to end on its own. The shortest cycle takes 1 to 2 hours, so check the display panel to see how much time is left."

          "headline":"Wait for the oven to cool before attempting to open the door.",
          "description":"The time you need to wait depends on how warm the oven got. If you shut it off at the beginning of the self-cleaning cycle, it didn\u2019t have time to get very warm. You may be able to open it within 10 to 20 minutes. If it was in the middle of the cycle, expect it to take anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes to cool. The lock stays engaged for safety reasons. Forcing the oven door open at this point could break the motorized lock, so wait for the lock light on the display to turn off. The amount of time you need to wait varies depending on your oven. A newer oven with a strong heater and plenty of insulation takes longer to cool down than a less efficient model."

Then, wait no more than 2 minutes for the oven to begin warming up. Afterward, press the stop button to cancel self-cleaning. The oven\u2019s control system sometimes fails to reset properly, causing the lock to stay engaged. The control detects that the oven is still hot even when it isn\u2019t."

Look to see if the lock light on the display has shut off. Make sure your home has power and that the circuit breaker hasn\u2019t tripped. Find the breaker box in your kitchen or basement and flip the breaker if it is in the off position. Remember to avoid forcing the door if it won\u2019t open. Try pressing the lock button for as long as 30 seconds. Sometimes that helps complete the reset."

You could also pull the oven out to remove the back panel. The motorized lock will be sticking out the back, so unscrew, pull it out, then press the metal bar hanging in the opening. The locking mechanism is very easy to spot behind the oven. It is a small device attached to a metal bar controlling the lock and held in place by a metal plate. It usually has a few small wires attached to it. Refer to your owner\u2019s manual for more information about reaching the lock or removing the locking mechanism. If you\u2019re worried about damaging it or unable to get to it yourself, contact a Kenmore repair technician."
