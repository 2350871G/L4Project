You can cut letters out of colorful paper and glue them down using a glue stick. You can also paint the letters on using a stencil and some acrylic paint. Making a Paper Tassel Garland Cut three 18 inch (45.72 centimeters) long strips of crepe paper. You can use all one color, or different colors. This will be enough to make one tassel. If you can't find crepe paper streamers, use tissue paper instead. Cut the tissue paper into 18 by 2 inch (45.72 by 5.08 centimeters) rectangles. Fold all three strips in half lengthwise. Place the strips one on top of each other in a stack. Then, fold all three in half at the same time. You'll end up with a thick, 9 inch (22.86 centimeters) long strip of crepe paper. Cut three vertical slits into the bottom, narrow edge of the streamer. Stop about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) away from the top fold. Try to keep the space between each slit the same. Unfold your streamer. Keep the edges aligned. You should end up with something that looks like a giant pair of whiskers. Roll the center part into a tube. Take your giant whiskers and start rolling the center un-cut part into a tight tube. This will make it easier to twist later. Twist the center part into a tight rope. You are only twisting those 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) of un-cut paper. Keep twisting until you have a 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) long rope. Leave the tassels/whiskers un-twisted. Fold the twisted part over a pen or pencil. This will help create a loop shape so that you can thread your tassel onto a piece of twine. Wrap the two ends of the rope together with a piece of tape.
