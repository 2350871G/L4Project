          "description":"One way to achieve the bohemian look in your home is to mix patterns. It\u2019s okay that it doesn\u2019t match. Choose patterns that you like and put them together with no care to having them match perfectly. You may want to choose a color base, like red or blue, and only choose patterns that have that base color. Choosing different kinds of patterns may help reduce any clashing. Two mismatched florals may look worse than a floral placed next to a southwest pattern."

          "headline":"Choose a variety of textures.",
          "description":"Another way to achieve the bohemian style is to have cotton alongside satin, faux fur, corduroy, and flannel. Try different textures on different items, or try mixing textures on the same item. For example, you may have a cotton comforter, satin pillows, and a faux fur throw blanket. You may also use pillows and blankets made from satin, corduroy, faux fur, and cotton. Choose chairs, sofas, and ottomans with different textured materials. Consider mixing textures on rugs, wall tapestries, and curtains."

Common colors are rusted red, deep orange, gold, brown, electric blue, deep purples, and pinks. You can choose one base color, or a few complimentary colors to start with. With bohemian decor, you can really choose any colors you want."

Cover your entire floor with rugs or place house plants on every surface. The options are unlimited, and you can have fun with your choices. Drape tapestries from the ceiling or around your bed to make a canopy or place them over chairs and dresses. You can even choose to repurpose pieces as accents. For example, you may use a window pane or a rug as a wall decoration. Stack your jewelry on your dresser for a bohemian decorative flair."

Use ottomans with interesting fabrics, like velvet, satin, or corduroy. You can look for pieces at antique shops, thrift stores, and garage sales.

Don't worry about cluttered walls or matching the decor. The bohemian ideal is to express your artistic side. For example, you may hang up a wall tapestry with a teal background with pink and yellow geometric patterns, prints of famous artworks, framed album covers, wooden wall art bought at local art fairs, and interesting wall hangings found at a thrift store. You may consider doing a collage on a wall of postcards, magazine cutouts, art prints, posters, and anything else you enjoy looking at."
