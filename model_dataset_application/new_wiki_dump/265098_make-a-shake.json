          "description":"There are three good ways to soften up ice cream for use in a shake. You can transfer the tub of ice cream from the freezer to the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes. Another option would be to take the ice cream out and let it sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes. If your ice cream is very hard, put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds, setting the power to 30%. You want the ice cream to be softened but not runny. As you\u2019re softening the ice cream, place your shake glass into the freezer to get it cold and frosty. Low-fat ice cream and frozen yogurt can be substituted for the ice cream."

Popular choices for flavorings are crushed cookies, chocolate syrup, shredded coconut and crushed candy pieces. You can use as much or as little of your chosen add-ins that you want. Refrain from adding ice to thin out your shake. If you want it to be thinner, add a little more milk until you reach the desired consistency."

The low speed mixes the ingredients into the ice cream effectively without changing the consistency too much, keeping it nice and thick. For a lighter, fluffy shake, blend the ingredients on high speed until mixed well. When using a low speed, you may need to stop once or twice to push your flavorings to the bottom of the blender with a spatula. If you don\u2019t have a regular blender, you can also use a stick-blender (also known as an immersion hand blender)."

The second way is using natural sources of protein, such as chia seeds, peanut butter and milk. Supplements deliver an extremely large amount of protein and are usually favored by body builders and workout enthusiasts. Natural protein sources offer a high amount of protein for the average person who isn\u2019t weight training."

          "description":"Whey protein is one of the two proteins found naturally in milk. The body absorbs this type of protein faster than other protein sources, which results in increased muscle protein synthesis. Whey protein also provides a large amount of the amino acid L-cysteine, which can improve deficiencies caused by many conditions, most notably aging and diabetes. It can also be beneficial for those with depression, blood pressure, blood sugar and can also help to treat symptoms of HIV and cancer. Whey protein supplements aren\u2019t known to cause liver or kidney damage. However, if you have pre-existing liver or kidney damage, whey protein supplements may worsen it. Consult your doctor before proceeding."

Unless you have a specific reason for doing so, the average person should not use these supplements, since they may put a strain on the kidneys and liver. Furthermore, protein from food sources is more nutritionally beneficial than supplements. Protein shakes, made with natural sources, benefit most adults. Most people don\u2019t get the recommended amount of protein, 45 to 50 grams, in their daily diet. The minimum recommended daily amount (RDA) is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. To calculate your RDA, multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36. Keep in mind that the RDA is the bare minimum you should take in each day. Experts say that you should get at least twice your RDA in protein for best results."
