The stain will be easiest to treat if you get to it right away, but even if it dries before you notice it, start treating it as soon as you're able to. The more hot sauce that's present, the more likely the stain will be to spread once you start trying to clean it, which is why scraping off the excess is important. Warning: If your garment is dry-clean only, scrape off the excess, then take it to a professional to have it cleaned."

          "description":"To absorb some of the oil from the stain, sprinkle a generous layer of baking powder over the entire surface of the stain. Leave it in place for at least 15 minutes, then turn the garment inside-out and rinse the back of the stain with cold running water. While this isn't likely to take the stain out of the garment, it can make it easier to clean, since it helps remove some of the oil. You can also use cornstarch if you don't have any baking powder on hand. Rinsing the stain from the back will help flush the oil out of the fabric without spreading the stain."

          "description":"Pour a small amount of liquid laundry detergent onto the garment, then gently rub the detergent onto the surface of the stain. Wait for about 3-5 minutes, then turn the garment inside-out and rinse the spot under cold running water. When you're finished, launder the garment as usual. Do not use bar soap or powder detergent. You'll likely have to scrub to get these to cover the spot, which could set the stain deeper into the fabric. This is especially useful for cleaning a stain that's dried, although it will work on fresh hot sauce stains, as well."

Your garment should dry quickly once you're finished! You can also use hand sanitizer or white vinegar if you don't have rubbing alcohol available. Just make sure the hand sanitizer is clear and fragrance-free so it won't stain your clothes."

Examine the garment closely once you finish washing it. If the hot sauce is completely gone, put the clothing in the dryer or hang it up to dry. If there's still a faint stain, continue treating the garment until it's gone. Washing the garment in cool water will prevent the stain from setting into the fabric if it isn't completely gone. If you prefer, you can hand wash the garment instead. Drying the clothing can set in the stain, which is why it's important to check before you put it in the dryer."
