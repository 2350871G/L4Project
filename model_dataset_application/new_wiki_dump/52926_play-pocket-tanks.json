If you choose to use burying weapons such as Mud Pie and Dirtball, be sure to grab any weapons they could use to counteract it such as Mountain Mover or Dirt Mover. They will then be forced to get negative points by hurting themselves to dig out. Try to use these weapons near your 8th to 9th volley."
