To be sure you won\u2019t damage your Saffiano leather, test your cleaning method of choice by applying it to a section of leather that won\u2019t be visible. For instance, if you\u2019re cleaning a Saffiano leather passport jacket, test your cleaning method on the inside of the jacket rather than the outside, where the area you really want to clean is. When testing, check the surface of your cleaning cloth, sponge, or cotton swab regularly to see if you\u2019re removing any color from the leather. If you are, find an alternate cleaning method."

Mix them together with a few gentle stirs and dip a sponge or soft hand towel into the water. With your sponge or towel damp (but not soaking wet), gently wipe the leather\u2019s surface. Use a dry sponge or hand towel to remove any excess liquid once you\u2019ve cleaned the leather to your satisfaction. Do not use tap water. The chlorine content could damage your Saffiano leather."

Do not rub or wipe the cotton all across the leather\u2019s surface or you might cause the color to rub off. After about 15 minutes, when the leather is dry, soak the cotton ball again and gently wipe the spot you previously dabbed. Add a small amount of hand cream to a cotton ball. Rub the cotton ball into the spot you\u2019ve been cleaning. Use a dry cotton ball to remove excess hand cream. You can use this method to effectively remove ink from Saffiano leather, but instead of applying hand cream at the end, turn your blow dryer on the lowest setting and use it to dry the spot where you applied the alcohol."
