This means you can get fourth or fifth place on one or two tracks, and still succeed if you do very well on the others. You get 15 points for winning a track, 12 points for second place, 10 points for third, and 8 points for fourth. After that, the points go down by 1 for each position. You'll usually need roughly 40 points to get 3rd place."

At the beach, drive onto the sand strip to the left to skip the water and duck monsters completely. There's another ramp at the end of this. The first shortcut leads you straight to this area. If you have a speed boost item, use it to go straight through the water! Just avoid the dark water, which is out of bounds."

The best way to reduce your time is to pick up as many items as you can, and use the speed boosts to cut across grassy and sandy areas. Speed items can also let you shoot up seemingly impossible slopes. This can take some practice to avoid going out of bounds, so don't try it if you're already going to get a good enough score."
