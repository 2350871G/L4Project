          "description":"If you use hand-held pruning shears and long lopping shears, you can cut branches and stems selectively. That way, you\u2019ll be able to manage your shrubs\u2019 growth strategically. Because they cut indiscriminately, hedge shears create multiple growing points. This results in top-heavy shrubs with dense outer growth, which kills the foliage in the interior of the plant. Use loppers to cut canes, or the larger branches that grow from the ground. Clip branches that are thinner than 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) with hand-held pruners. Wear gardening gloves to protect your hands and get a better grip on your cutting tools."

          "description":"Clean shears will promote healing and minimize the risk of spreading disease. Wipe down the blades with a clean cloth or paper towel dipped in rubbing alcohol that\u2019s at least 70% pure. The shears will quickly dry, so there\u2019s no need to wipe them again with another cloth. Sanitizing your tools is especially important if you've just taken them out of winter storage. Clean your tools after pruning a diseased tree and when you\u2019re finished pruning everything."

On the other hand, if you leave too long of a stub, the cut will heal slowly. Aim for a sweet spot between \u20444 and \u20442 in (0.64 and 1.27 cm) from the main branch."

The 45-degree angle will make it easier to cut cleanly, promote healing, and minimize the risk of rot. Additionally, cut at an angle away from the crotch, or where a stem meets the main branch. That way, if you slip, you won\u2019t drive the blade into the main branch and injure it."

Pruning your shrubs immediately after their flowers fade will maximize their growing time, resulting in more blooms next growing season. Mock orange shrubs finish blooming by late spring. If you prune in the early spring before your shrubs bloom, you'll cut off the buds that will grow into flowers. There\u2019s usually no need to prune mock orange shrubs until their third or fourth year."

Trim dead or twiggy shoots that sprout from the ground to the crown, or just above ground level. If they grow from another branch, clip them to their point of origin on the main branch. Remember to clip stems at a 45-degree angle about \u20444 to \u20442 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) from the main branch. For dead or twiggy shoots that sprout from the ground, trim them about \u20444 to \u20442 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) from where they emerge from the ground. Dead or damaged stems might harbor disease, so sanitize your shears after clipping them."

          "description":"Find the tallest canes, or the main branches that grow from the ground. Trace the tallest one down to the crown, then use your loppers to cut it back to ground level. Pull the pruned cane out from the shrub, then cut it up so it fits in a lawn bag or in your compost heap. Prune around 20 to 30% of the canes to control the shrub\u2019s growth and to give the interior leaves access to sunlight. Tying ribbons around the canes you want to cut can help you prune the shrub evenly."

          "description":"After removing the tallest canes, check the top of the shrub for uneven shoots, or stems that are taller than the surrounding foliage. Shape the shrub by clipping the tallest remaining stems just above the point where another shoot sprouts from the branch. This will encourage horizontal growth and result in a fuller, more attractive shrub. For instance, suppose you want to remove about 6 in (15 cm) of growth at the top of a branch. Trace the cane you want to clip down to a point where a stem emerges from the main branch. Clip the main branch \u20444 to \u20442 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) above the point where the stem emerges. Clip taller stems until the shrub\u2019s height is roughly even. The shrub should still look natural, so don\u2019t try to make the top perfectly flat like a formally manicured hedge."

For example, suppose your soil has lots of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), but is low in nitrogen (N). You\u2019d check the N-P-K ratios on fertilizer labels, and go with a product with a higher N value, such as 14-7-7. If you don't need to correct a nutrient deficiency, choose a fertilizer labeled for shrubs and trees with an N-P-K ratio of 3-1-2 or 3-1-1, such as 15-5-10 or 15-5-5. Apply fertilizer at the start of the growing season according to your product\u2019s instructions. As a rule of thumb, apply about 4  fl oz (120 mL) of liquid fertilizer diluted in 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water.
