          "description":"Most people have heard of the George Foreman electric grills and similar brands, which come in many sizes and grill both sides of the food at one time. However, you should shop around to find the one that suits your needs and kitchen space best. For example, there are three main types of indoor grills; a countertop model with one-sided grilling, a countertop model with dual-sided grilling, and a range top that sits on a stove burner and mimics an outdoor grill. Countertop models, like the Hamilton Beach or DeLonghi, are often electric, smokeless, and easy to clean due to their non-stick surfaces. A range top or stovetop grill, like the Staub Rectangular Grill Pan, can create a lot of smoke if you cook a lot at once. However, they are better for mimicking the look and feel of an outdoor grill, because you can get the same kind of char marks."

These are similar to any normal pan, except they have grooves that mimic the grate of a grill, which allows you to get the same kind of char marks you'd find on an outdoor setup. Most grill pans are cast iron or stainless steel, like the Anolon Tri-Ply Clad Deep Round Grill. They are also usually non-stick and small enough to be stored in a cupboard with other pans."

          "description":"Some grills come with only one setting, while other grills allow you to raise or lower the heat throughout the cooking process. Being able to adjust the temperature of your grill while cooking will help make sure you cook your food all the way through without burning it. Most if not all range top grills will adjust the temperature with your stove, however, depending on the width and length, they may heat sections differently. An electric grill like the Cuisinart Griddler will allow you to change the temperature separately on each plate, which is great if you want to cook two different foods at one time."

          "description":"Most contact or countertop grills come with a slanted surface that allows the fat to drip off or drain through the center. They may also even come with a built-in plate or tray to collect it. However, for range top models like grill pans, there is usually no method for draining excess oils, so cleaning is more difficult. Countertop grills are usually non-stick and contained, which means you won\u2019t have a lot of oil or fat splattering all over your counter. They are also relatively easy to clean with just hot water and paper towels. Rangetop grills or grill pans, on the other hand, can be a bit messier. Depending on the size or how much food you are cooking, they can cause a lot of smoke - and can spray a lot of kitchen area with oil. However, the cleaning is about the same as a countertop grill."

You can use it on anything, too; steaks, burgers, pork chops, chicken, even on vegetables. You can find liquid smoke in most grocery stores, just look in the sections for marinades and barbecue sauces. When using liquid smoke, simply pour a small amount of it over your food. Be careful of using too much, though, as it may add a chemical taste to your food when overused.

          "description":"Some indoor grills might require you to cook your food a little longer than outdoor grills. This is especially true when it comes to electric grills, as the heating method requires the coils to heat up first. On the other hand, with a range top that uses your stove, the heat source is stronger and more direct. Just keep in mind that if you are using a grill pan over two burners, you are going to have areas that don\u2019t heat as quickly. Use a meat thermometer to ensure your food is cooking long enough. The cook time for your food will depend on the cut of meat and what type of indoor grill you're using, however, expect anywhere between 4-10 minutes for beef in a double-sided grill, 4-6 minutes for poultry, and 6-10 minutes for pork. If you are using a one-sided grill, you can expect the time to double."

          "description":"Do not use metal utensils on nonstick surfaces and avoid harsh cleaning ingredients on your iron grill pans. For example, try sticking with just hot water and a light dish soap, as using a harsh scrub brush or steel wool on your indoor grills will wear down the surface and lead to uneven heating in the future. Even if you feel you have an excess of charred residue, simply run your grill under hot water and scrub lightly with a sponge. The nonstick surface will ensure any leftovers come off easily."

Try grilling corn, asparagus, zucchini, or squash. You can even cut up a mix of these and put them together in foil with some oil and spices like rosemary or thyme before putting them on the grill.
