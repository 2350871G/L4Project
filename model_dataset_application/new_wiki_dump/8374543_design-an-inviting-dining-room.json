Decide whether you\u2019ll be doing the work yourself or if you\u2019ll hire professionals. Start with savings or other money you've set aside for your dining room. Allocate money for painting, flooring, and other structural elements. It might be best to get estimates from several contractors for these costs. Determine how much money you have for major pieces of furniture. This includes your table, chairs, and buffet. Consider if you can use anything you already own or if you need to replace them. Figure out how much money you want to reserve for accessories like artwork, plants, or rugs."

Without looking at how others have designed inviting dining rooms, you won't be equipped to prepare your own. Consult:\nFurniture catalogs. Home improvement magazines. Consider magazines like \"Better Homes and Gardens,\" \"Martha Stewart Living,\" or \"Good Housekeeping.\" Websites. Try websites associated with popular magazines or TV channels like HGTV. Contact an interior designer for a consultation if you don\u2019t know where to start."

Thus, you need to make sure you are conscious of the style you are choosing when you design your dining room. If you\u2019re not, your room may clash or send mixed signals to guests. Consider styles such as neoclassical, Tudor, art deco, French countryside, or shabby sheik. Your style may or may not reflect the overall style of your home\u2014just make sure you won\u2019t grow sick of it over time. If you choose a clashing style, make sure to clash responsibly and do so deliberately. For instance, you may choose to stick an art deco serving table into a room decorated with a Tudor style."

          "description":"As the centerpiece of your dining room, your table will set the tone for the whole room. If you choose an inappropriate table, you\u2019ll inadvertently set a tone that you don\u2019t want. Your table should be an appropriate size for your room. You should have at least 36 inches (91 cm) between your table and the wall (or furniture). Ideally, you should have 48 inches (123 cm) between the two so you can pull out chairs comfortably. Think about whether you want an expandable table with leaves. Ask yourself if you\u2019ll be hosting gatherings a lot and if you\u2019ll need the extra space. Consider the style of your table and whether it will match other accent furniture. Major styles include traditional (with many ornate details), contemporary style (relatively simple), transitional (some ornate details but relatively simple), and the country style (these might appear shabby chic or distressed). Determine the material you want your table made from. While some people prefer a traditional wood, others might want a upscale mahogany, and some people may want a modern-looking glass or metal table. Take the maintenance involved into consideration as you pick a material. Think about whether the table will age well. Ultimately, a cheap table that looks good today might look horrible in 5 years \u2013 forcing you to redesign your whole dining room."

          "headline":"Add seating.",
          "description":"Seating is an essential element in any dining room. Thus, you need to put a lot of thought into the types of seating and number of options you\u2019ll include. When picking seating, consider:\nProvide seating for your average dining party. For most people, this ranges from 8 to 12. Pick chairs based on style and comfort. The style should match or compliment the overall style of the room. In addition, chairs should be comfortable so people can relax and enjoy their meal. Think about using benches or even stools as an alternative to table chairs. Consider adding couches, loveseats, or extra chairs throughout the space. Couches and loveseats, in particular, can create a more intimate setting in a large dining room. Mix the styles of chairs for a stylish option. Incorporate 2 chairs and a bench, or place 2 grand chairs at the ends of the table."

          "headline":"Pick serving tables and side tables.",
          "description":"After your table and chairs, you need to think about serving tables and side tables when designing your inviting dining room. These tables are important, as they\u2019ll likely make your serving experience easy and more user-friendly. Consider a buffet. A buffet is a long table or piece of furniture where you can store dishes (underneath or in cabinets) and place food before it is served. Think about adding a simple serving table. Like buffets, simple serving tables are a place to stage food before it is served or a place to sit food and allow people to serve themselves. Use a hutch to display dishes or decor. Add side tables. Side tables are important if you have informal seating areas in your dining room. They may be a place for company to set drinks or appetizer plates while they chat."

Accent pieces will tie everything together, add your personal touch, and impress guests with your thoughtfulness. Lighting fixtures. Mirrors. Artwork. Artwork could include paintings, pieces of pottery, glasswork, or more. Plants. Rugs. Remember to not add too many accent pieces, as you don\u2019t want the room to feel crowded.

On the other hand, a poor choice of drapery can send negative messages to your guests. Choose your drapery after you\u2019ve chosen other major elements of your dining room, like the main pieces of furniture (seats, the table, and serving tables). Depending on your taste and style, you may want to match your drapery to rugs or other accent pieces. Your drapery should always be chosen when considering the color of your wall and floor."

Thus, you need to make sure the color scheme is appropriate, planned, and inviting. Don\u2019t mix warm and cool undertones. For instance, don\u2019t choose a warm wall paint (tan) and cool drapes (light blue). Consider this when matching the floor, wall paint, and furniture. Avoid mixing smoky or muted colors with bright colors. For instance, don\u2019t choose a washed-out red for drapes and a bright lime for the wall paint. Think about this when you are creating a plan for the whole room. Paint small rooms cool colors. Cool colors, like grey, white, or light blues, will make a smaller space seem larger. Use neutral colors on the walls and floor if you have colorful art to display. Use warm colors in large spaces. Warm colors, like browns, tans, or reds, will make large spaces seem more intimate."

To create an inviting dining space, you need to make sure that the view from your entryway is truly inviting. Avoid blocking the entryway with tables or chairs. Make sure the space of the entryway transitions into the space of the dining room. For example, if you can balance the walkway space from the entryway and the space between your table and a side table or buffet, do so. Create balance and symmetry with your design to make a central focal point. Pick a couple pieces of artwork or furniture that will capture your guests\u2019 attention as they enter the dining room."

Without ample space to move, your room won\u2019t be inviting. Space chairs so people can easily leave the table. Don\u2019t situate a table to close to a wall or piece of furniture. Take out any pieces of furniture that inhibit the movement of people. For example, while you want to add a cute coffee table to your informal sitting area, it may hinder the movement of people through that corner of your dining room."

          "headline":"Avoid cluttering your dining room.",
          "description":"The easiest way to turn an inviting space into an uninviting space is to clutter it up. By cluttering a space, you send the message that items are more important than people. You also distract people from all the planning you\u2019ve done on your color scheme and furniture. Don\u2019t view wall space as something to fill or conquer. Position painting and furniture a couple feet apart. Never try to cover table, curio, or china cabinet space completely. Focus on an elegant and balanced look rather than a full look. For instance, you don\u2019t need to display all your rare salt and pepper shakers. Display your most cherished ones, and store the rest. Ask friends and family if they think your dining room has a bare or cluttered look. Let them know that you just want their honest opinion. For instance, say \u201cJohn, can you honestly tell me whether this room looks bare or cluttered? I\u2019m trying to create an inviting dining space and I think I\u2019m not there yet.\u201d"
