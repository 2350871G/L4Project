Every time you try a new set of needles, knit a new gauge swatch to test them.

Some patterns require that you wash and block (or shape while damp) your swatch before measuring--this is important because some yarns will change gauge after washing and blocking. Wash the swatch the same way you plan to wash the finished item. Measure the gauge swatch with a ruler. Hold or pin it down flat--don't stretch it or scrunch it. If you cast on the number of stitches specified in the pattern, it should be 4 inches (10.2 cm) on each side, forming an even square (the corners should make right angles, the square shouldn't be crooked). If you cast on a different number of stitches than the number recommended for your pattern gauge, you will need to count your stitches. Count the stitches and rows per inch.

You can also adjust your gauge by changing the type of yarn you use (thinner yarn if you need more stitches or rows, thicker yarn if you need less) but this is usually inconvenient and should not be necessary if you purchased yarn similar to what was recommended. Gauge swatch #2 Check the pattern for the sts. per inch. If possible, also use the rows per inch. Cast on 4 times the sts. per inch for a 4\" swatch plus 10 sts. It is more accurate to measure over 4\" than only measuring over a 1\" piece. Start knitting for five rows of garter stitch. Knit every row. Begin the actual measured swatch knitting keeping the 5 sts. at beg and end of row in garter stitch. On the first right side row, knit the 5 edge stitches and then *k2tog, yo*. Repeat this to denote the size needles you are knitting the swatch with. If the rows per inch is noted knit in pattern for 4 times the count. Namely, 6 rows per inch = 24 rows per 4\". Return to garter stitch and knit another 5 rows. Bind off. You now have a completed swatch with garter stitch on all sides to keep it laying flat. Place your flat ruler on the swatch and measure the inside st st. area.",
