  "text":" Marking the Area Check for utilities under the area you want to add pavers to. Before breaking any ground, make sure to contact your local utility organizations to see if there are any pipes or wires below the area you want to dig. In the United States, this can be done by calling 811. Other country-specific Dial Before You Dig hotlines and websites include:\nAustralia: Call 1100. Canada: Visit Enbridge.com.

Make sure to take measurements from multiple areas, including the center and corners, to ensure that the entire pit is even. If necessary, keep digging or fill in low spots. If you removed them while digging, reattach your strings before taking measurements. Adding Gravel, Edge Restraints, and Sand Add a base layer of gravel. Pour your gravel or other crushed rock into the excavated pit. After every 2 inches (5.1 cm), use a hand tamper or mechanical plate compactor to compress the layer into a fine, solid base. Add gravel until you are about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the slope line, or the depth of one paver added to the 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) of space necessary to accommodate your sand. Install edge restraints around the perimeter.

If your stones are irregularly shaped, you may need to cut the edges first using a jigsaw. Keep in mind that you may need to adjust the edge restraints after you install the pavers. Put down a layer of landscape fabric (optional). For an extra defense against weeds, put down a layer of landscape fabric between the gravel and sand. This fabric prevents light from reaching the bottom layer of soil, making it harder for weeds to grow. Though it can be placed before the layer of gravel instead, laying it down after prevents sand from sifting into the cracks. Add a layer of bedding sand.
