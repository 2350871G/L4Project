Dig out the soil around and under the root first, then cut with a root saw or loppers. Cutting roots aggressively can put the tree in a long decline, potentially killing it over many years. Follow these rules of thumb to prevent this:\nMultiply the diameter of the tree by eight. That's the minimum distance from the trunk you can cut with low risk of serious harm.

          "description":"Some trees respond to cut roots or other damage by sending up new suckers from the root system. To kill these selectively, sever the root so the herbicide does not travel to the main tree. Apply an herbicide that contains glyphosate or triclopyr amine carefully to the sucker so it does not spray to nearby plants. Many suckering plants grow aggressively. If you are not willing to kill the main tree, you will need to repeat this treatment or periodically dig up the suckers by hand. If you've cut down the main tree but suckers are still appearing in your yard, your only option may be to apply a broadleaf herbicide. This will kill all vegetation in the area. Repeat each time suckers appear until the roots run out of nutrients."

Since this does not kill the roots, it will not protect garden areas or sewage pipes. Carefully remove any damaged concrete with minimal damage to roots. Cover the area with geotextile fabric. Leave 6\" (15 cm) of clear ground around the trunk, or 12\" (30 cm) for large trees.
