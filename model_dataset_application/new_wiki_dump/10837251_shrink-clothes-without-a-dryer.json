Always wash only the garment that you want to shrink, as otherwise, the other items might shrink too! This also stops the color of bright or vivid garments from bleeding into other clothing. You can shrink multiple items together if they are all a similar color and the same type of fabric. Cotton, denim, polyester, and wool can all shrink well in the washing machine."

This means that the machine will use very hot water to wash the garment, which gives it the best possible chance of shrinking. Clothing fibers are stretched during manufacturing due to stress. Hot water releases the stress and the fibers spring down to a smaller size."

Pick the longest cycle length and then press the start button once the settings are correct. You don\u2019t need to add any laundry detergent to the machine unless you want to wash the garment at the same time. It will shrink regardless."

Use cooking tongs to remove the garment once the time is up and place it in a laundry bucket to prevent water from dripping everywhere. The amount of time that you need to leave the garment in the boiling water for depends on how much you want it to shrink and the type of fabric. Silk tends to shrink very fast, so simply immerse the silk in the boiling water and then remove it again to shrink it. Cotton also tends to shrink relatively fast. It usually takes 5-10 minutes. Polyester and denim garments take the longest to shrink, so it\u2019s likely that you will need to soak them for 20-30 minutes."

The garment will probably take longer to dry than usual because of the excess water. If the garment is made of wool, lay it flat to dry to prevent the fibers from stretching back out. Avoid wringing out the garment, as this can cause the fabric fibers to stretch."
