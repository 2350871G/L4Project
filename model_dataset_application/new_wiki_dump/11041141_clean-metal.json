          "description":"Wash the pot or pan with warm, soapy water. Rinse it out, then fill it up with clean water, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of lemon juice or white vinegar, and boil the water for 15 minutes. Carefully dump out the water after 15 minutes and dry the item off thoroughly. To clean off burned-on food, pour some water into the soiled pot or pan and boil it on a burner for 5 minutes; after that, you can scrape away the burnt-on food with a rubber spatula. To clean an aluminum surface with acid, cut a lemon in half, dip the exposed end in salt, then rub it over the aluminum surface. Wipe the surface down afterward with a damp cloth and then dry it off thoroughly. Avoid using steel wool or anything similar on your aluminum goods\u2014you may be tempted to scour stuck on food, but doing so could permanently damage the item."

Blot it dry with paper towel, then pour a little bit of olive oil onto a dry paper towel and lightly coat the interior of the pot or pan with cooking oil. Store your cast iron items in a cool place that doesn\u2019t come into contact with any moisture. Never put your cast iron into the dishwasher or soak it in water for a long time (it\u2019ll rust really quickly)."

          "description":"Wipe down the brass item with a wet, soapy cloth. Squeeze the juice out of a cut lemon into a small bowl. Mix in about 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 grams) of baking soda until it combines with the juice to make a paste. Buff the brass with the paste using a clean, lint-free towel, rinse away the residue with warm water, and dry the item off. Test your item to make sure it really is made of brass by trying to stick a magnet on it. If the magnet sticks, you probably have something that is brass-plated. If it doesn\u2019t stick, you\u2019re working with pure brass. Use a little bit of olive oil to shine your brass item after you\u2019ve cleaned and polished it. Just dab some onto a cloth and lightly rub it all over the brass.
