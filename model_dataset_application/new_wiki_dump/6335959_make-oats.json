          "description":"Attach the bottom of the roller to the edge of a kitchen counter or table using an appropriately sized vise clamp. Many oat rollers are sold with a matching clamp for this purpose. The clamp should hold the machine down as you grind the oats, making it easier to operate as a result. This step is especially important when using a manual oat roller, but many electric versions are heavy enough to remain steady even if you do not clamp them down."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Load the machine with oats.",
          "description":"Place the oats directly into the hopper at the top of the machine. Fill the hopper to the top edge, but avoid overfilling it beyond that point. If the hopper is too small to fit the entire portion of oats, work the oats through in separate batches."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose the setting.",
          "description":"Many oat rollers have three settings. Switch settings as desired by turning the regulating knob on the side or back of the machine. Turning the knob changes the distance between the machine's roller bars, thereby allowing the machine to crush the oats into different sizes. Generally, the three settings include coarse grind, coarse flakes, and thinly rolled flakes. Use the \"rolled flake\" setting for rolled oats that resemble modern store-bought varieties. If you would prefer larger, old-fashioned rolled oats, use the \"coarse flakes\" setting. Choosing the \"coarse grind\" setting will crush the grains instead of flaking them. The resulting meal will be smaller than the flakes and will generally cook faster, but it should not be used as flour."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Turn the crank.",
          "description":"Insert the handle into the side of the machine, if necessary, then turn it clockwise to pass the loaded oats through the rollers and into the collection basin. Whole oats are easy to crush, so turning the handle shouldn't require much strength. If you use an electric version instead of a manual one, press the \"On\" button (or its equivalent) to pass the oats through the machine."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Collect the oats.",
          "description":"Pull the collection basin out from the bottom of the machine. Turn it upside-down into a bowl or other container to collect the newly rolled oats. Use clean hands to quickly sift through the rolled oats. Most moderate to high quality rollers will crush the oats evenly, but damaged or poor quality machines may produce inconsistent results. If most or all of the oats are not ground as finely as you would like, you may wish to pass them through the machine again. If only a few grains appear unbroken or too large, however, it might be easiest to simply pick them out and discard them."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use the rolled oats as desired.",
          "description":"To enjoy the full benefits of freshly rolled oats, use them immediately or within several days. You can use them to make oatmeal or any other recipe calling for rolled oats. Freshly rolled oats retain more of their nutrients and natural flavor. The nutritional benefits and taste will gradually decline in quality as the rolled oats remain in storage, though. If you cannot use the rolled oats immediately, place them into an airtight, freezer-safe container or plastic freezer bag and store them in your freezer for several days to two weeks. Thaw the frozen grains before use."

          "description":"Pour the rolled oats into the bowl of a food processor. Gently shift the machine from side to side, distributing the oats into an even layer. Use either freshly rolled oats or store-bought rolled oats for this process. Keeping the oats in an even layer will make it easier for the blades to reach the separate oats at a consistent pace. If you do not have a food processor, you could use a blender, instead."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pulse well.",
          "description":"Quickly pulse the oats four or five times, or until they appear coarsely chopped. Do not wait until the oats turn into powder. Operate the machine in short bursts. Each burst should last no longer than one or two seconds. You can still use the oats for oatmeal if you accidentally grind them down into powder, but the resulting consistency will be mushy instead of chunky."
        },

          "headline":"Sift through the oats.",
          "description":"Gently stir the oats with a spoon. If there are still large, pieces of oats in the bowl of the machine, pulse the batch again. Before pulsing the oats again, make sure that the larger pieces are positioned directly next to the blades. Try to stir the smaller pieces further away from the blades to prevent them from breaking down into powder. If you work in small batches, you may not need a second round of pulsing."

If you're starting with freshly rolled oats, try to use these quick-cooking oats immediately since they will retain more flavor and nutrients. If you're starting with store-bought rolled oats, you should be able to store these quick-cooking oats in an airtight container at room temperature or in your refrigerator.

To make oat flour, use rolled oats or quick-cooking oats. To make coarse oat bran, opt for whole oat groats. Note that you should only use whole oats if you have a durable, high-powered blender. Only use hulled oat groats; do not use raw grains. Whole oat groats can be used to create flour, as well, but they will be much more difficult to work with and will need a longer processing time.

When starting with store-bought rolled oats or quick oats, keep the finished product until the expiration date marked on the original container of oats. Method Four: Thick and Enhanced Instant Oatmeal Combine the dry ingredients. Place the oats, oat flour, salt, sugar, powdered creamer, and dried fruit into a plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake it well to combine the ingredients. If desired, you could prepare the dry mix ahead of time. Keep the oatmeal mixture in its sealed bag and store it at room temperature.
