Once you've added the dumplings, stir them quickly so they don't stick to each other. If you don't want your dumplings to be mushy, make sure to partially thaw them before boiling. Letting them sit at room temperature for 15 minutes should be enough."

          "description":"Do this right after you've added and stirred the dumplings. If you've filled two-thirds of a large pot, you should add another 1.5 cups (350 mL) of water. Once you've done this, the water in the pot will stop boiling. Make sure you've brought it to a boil again before continuing. Adding more water is done to prevent you from undercooking the filling. The filling and the dough in a frozen dumpling usually don't take the same amount of time to cook. By adding cold water, you slow down the cooking process and make sure both parts of the dumpling are cooked perfectly."

If you want to be sure the dumplings are cooked through, take one out of the pot, cut it in half, and try it."

Use a large pan since you'll need to arrange the dumplings neatly. Adding 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of vegetable oil to the pan should be enough to keep the dumplings from sticking. Heat the oil over moderate heat to avoid burning the dumplings. When steam-frying the dumplings, you don't need to limit yourself to vegetable oil.

Swirl the pan while the water is evaporating to give the dumplings a nice crust. The dumplings should now be ready to eat. Microwaving and Pan-Frying the Dumplings Put water and the dumplings in a microwave-safe bowl. Add the dumplings first so you'll know how much water to use. Pour just enough so they're half covered in water. It's best to use cold water with this method. Cover the bowl and cook the dumplings in the microwave. Make sure to use a microwave-safe plate or lid as a cover. Set the microwave to the highest power and place the covered bowl in it. Cook the dumplings in the microwave for 3 minutes. Make sure to partially thaw the dumplings before you put them in the microwave or they might burn. Drain the dumplings and heat oil in a nonstick pan. Once they're out of the microwave, the dumplings should be thoroughly drained. You should also oil a nonstick pan and place it over medium heat. It should be hot when you start frying the dumplings.
