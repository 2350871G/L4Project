Since it folds so easily and stays in place, your food will remain secure in the foil and keep its shape. While foil is best for wrapping things like sandwiches or burritos, it can also be used to create a little pouch for foods like cereal, popcorn, or candies."

Place the lid on tightly to keep the food fresh and choose a container that fits your food snugly. It\u2019s best not to have lots of open space in your container between the food and the lid, as this can cause the food to spoil faster and not stay as fresh. Check to be sure your plastic container is labeled as BPA-free so chemicals won't accidentally be leaking into your foods from the plastic."

          "description":"Rip off a rectangular piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil and place your sandwich in the middle. Pull the top and bottom edges up together and create a fold with them that's roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Continue refolding the fold until it's flush against the sandwich. Form triangle creases with the 2 loose ends before tucking the ends under the sandwich to keep the wrapping in place. Use aluminum foil to help keep hot sandwiches, like grilled cheese, warm. If you used parchment paper or wax paper, consider cutting through the paper to slice your sandwich in half for easy eating."

Set the food down diagonally on the paper near a corner and bring this corner up over the food. Holding the corner in place, begin rolling the food toward the other end of the paper, stopping to fold in the edges before you get to the very end. Use a piece of tape to keep the edge of the paper in place. This is also a great way to wrap burritos. Avoid heating up wax paper."

Fold the right corner two-thirds of the way across to the left side before tucking this corner into the flap you\u2019ve created.

Place your food in the center of the piece of foil and pull the 2 longest edges up together. Fold these edges to create a crease, and continue folding over the crease until it's flat against the food.
