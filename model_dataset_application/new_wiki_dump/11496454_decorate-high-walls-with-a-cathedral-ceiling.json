Use white paint on the whole room to make it look even more open and bring more light in. Go for white paint for a clean, simple design choice. A white wall is a blank canvas and can make any artwork or decor stand out more."

          "headline":"Make the wall pop by painting it a signature color.",
          "description":"A color that fits in with your general decor theme is a great way to make a statement with your high walls. Try painting just one tall wall to make the accent color stand out. If you want a more understated look, try a neutral color like beige, grey, or even a light blue. To make more of an impact, try red or navy. Think about the furniture and decor in the room when deciding on an accent color for the wall. For example, if you are going for a beachy decor, try a light, neutral color. If you are using warm, natural textures like wood, go for a deep red or blue. In general, cool colors like blue will make your wall look even taller, while warm colors like red will make the wall look smaller."

          "description":"You can make a statement without much decoration just by painting your high walls a dark color. Try navy, charcoal, or even black for your high wall for an unexpected look. This can be overwhelming if you use the same dark color on all the walls, so consider painting an accent wall instead. If you don't want your whole wall to be dark, consider a 2-tone solution with the lower half painted white and the upper half of the wall painted in a dark color. Use wooden trim to separate the 2 colors."

Or, if you feel confident in your painting skills, you can paint an abstract mural on one wall to have your own art installation at home. If you go for this option, make the paint or wallpaper the central focus of the wall, and don't add anything on top of it."

Look for a striking piece of art that takes up most of the wall to draw attention to the high ceilings. When choosing artwork for your home, first and foremost look for pieces that speak to you.

If you have a large piece of horizontal artwork that fits well on the wall, use it as the focal point of the wall. A large piece of horizontal art will balance out the emptiness of a room without being too overwhelming. Hang paintings at eye level, if possible.

You can look for an abstract wall sculpture for a contemporary look, or a sculpture of something like tree branches or antlers to bring a bit of the natural world inside. Alternatively, you can display a collection of something on the wall. Antique plates or masks make a striking display."
