To just use the freezer, pour the mixture into a covered container and place it into the freezer. After it turns into a slush, mash it with a fork before returning it to the freezer. Once it's completely frozen, transfer it to a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Pour it back to the covered container and replace in the freezer until you are ready to serve it."
