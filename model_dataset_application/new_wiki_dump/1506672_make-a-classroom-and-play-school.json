      "description":"First, find out the number of students coming to your classroom. A student desk can be a chair, a seat on the floor, or, a real student desk. You can also seat your students around a table. If the students are in the floor or a chair, give them a large hard cover book so they can have a surface to write on."

      "headline":"Have something to watch.",
      "description":"If you or your family has a laptop, you can move it into the room. A phone is also good for fake calls to different rooms. A TV might be a good idea, along with a DVD player so you can watch a movie for recess or if you have movies about anything educational, you can watch that. You may want to ask your parents before you do this and about the movies to watch. Any movie is fine for recess, as long as you don't spend too much time on it. Twenty minutes is a good time limit. You might also want a bookshelf or something so you can put your friends coat (if they have one) lunch, backpack, graded papers, notebook, pens, pencils, and everything else they might have brought. You need to ask them to bring these things."
