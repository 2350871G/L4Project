Though they are not fully understood, earthquake lights may be emitted from rocks that are under extreme stress. Earthquake lights have not been reported before all earthquakes, nor has the timing been consistent, but if you hear about strange lights or talk of UFO in your area, you may want to go over your earthquake preparedness plan and make sure your emergency survival kit is stocked. Earthquake lights have been observed as short, blue flames coming up from the ground, as orbs of light that float in the air, or as huge forks of light that look like lightening shooting up from the ground."

          "description":"There are reports of animals, from toads to bees to birds and bears, abandoning their homes or breeding grounds just before an earthquake. It is not understood why animals may sense an oncoming event, possibly because of changes in the electric field or responding to the P-wave, but noticing strange behavior in your pet may give you a heads up that something is about to happen. Chickens may stop laying eggs before an earthquake. If you notice your hens stop laying eggs for no reason, make sure you and your family know what to do in case of an earthquake. Catfish respond violently to changes in electric fields, which may occur before an earthquake. If you are fishing and see a ton of catfish suddenly thrashing around, it is possible an earthquake is on the way. Look around for a safe place away from trees or bridges that might fall on you. Dogs, cats, and other animals can feel an earthquake seconds before it can be detected by humans. If your pet begins acting nervous and erratic, becomes frightened of seemingly nothing and runs to hide, or if your normally calm dog begins to bite and bark, you may want to look around for a place to take cover.Dogs will also howl a lot and loud if there is an earthquake."

If you experience one or more small earthquakes, there may be another, bigger earthquake on the way. Because it is impossible to predict how long an earthquake will last or its magnitude, when you feel the ground begin to roll, take the appropriate actions to protect yourself from falling debris, depending on where you are (indoors, outdoors, in your car)."

These alert messages can provide you with instructions in an emergency, including evacuation routes and available emergency shelters.

Make sure you know if your town or city has such a warning system.One misconception about warning systems is that they predict earthquakes. Currently, earthquake early warning systems only warn about earthquakes in progress and when tremors are imminent. They do not predict earthquakes, and they do not serve as a replacement for earthquake preparedness."

Vehicle survival kits should include maps, jumper cables, enough water for at least 3 days (1 gallon per person per day), non-perishable foods, blankets, flashlights. Don't forget your pets!
