          "description":"Tablets are the most popular way to chlorinate a pool. They\u2019re easier to use, last longer, and are gentler on pool liners than liquid options, which are best used as shock treatments. Unlike granulated options, tablets dissolve slowly, which ensures even distribution. Purchase chlorine tablets online or at a pool supply store. Tablets come in 1 inch (2.5 cm) and 3 inches (7.6 cm) sizes. The larger tablets are the preferred option. They\u2019re easier to handle, last longer, and are generally less expensive than 1 inch (2.5 cm) tablets."

          "description":"You\u2019ll need to know how much water your pool holds in order to determine the right amount of chlorine to add. For a quick estimate, measure your pool\u2019s length and width, find the average depth, then multiply length by width by the average depth. If your pool is circular, measure the diameter, divide that value by 2 to find the radius, then use the formula \u03c0rh, where r is the radius and h is the average depth. Suppose you have a 50 ft \u00d7 20 ft (15.2 m \u00d7 6.1 m) pool. If the shallow end is 3 ft (0.91 m) deep and the deep end is 6 ft (1.8 m) deep, the average depth is 4.5 ft (1.4 m). After finding the average depth, you'd multiply 50 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 4.5 ft (15.2 \u00d7 6.1 \u00d7 1.4 m) to find a volume of 4500 cubic feet (127 m). Since 1 cubic foot (0.028 m) contains 7.48 gallons (28.3 L) of water, your pool holds 33,760 gallons (127,800 L) of water. You can also download an app or use an online calculator to find your pool\u2019s volume."

          "headline":"Test your pool water to determine how much chlorine to add.",
          "description":"Before chlorinating your pool, test the pH and chemical levels using a pool water test kit. Read your product\u2019s instructions; the label will let you know how much to add based on your pool\u2019s volume to reach the target chlorine level in ppm. Your test kit will show multiple chlorine readings. Free available chlorine is active and kills germs, while combined chlorine is the amount that\u2019s been used up killing germs. Test your pool water daily if it gets regular use, and maintain a free available chlorine level between 1 and 3 ppm. If you\u2019re maintaining a spa or hot tub, keep the free available chlorine level around 4 ppm. Always round up to the nearest 5,000 gallons (19,000 L). For instance, suppose you have a 33,760 gallons (127,800 L) pool, your current chlorine level is around 0 ppm, and your product directs you to add 1 tablet per 5,000 gallons (19,000 L) to increase chlorine levels by 1 ppm. You\u2019d need 14 tablets to achieve a reading of 2 ppm."

          "description":"Simply tossing tablets into the pool won\u2019t do the trick. Instead, it\u2019s best to use a floating chlorine feeder, chlorinating skimmer, or other automatic dispensing device. All you need to do is place the tablets in the feeder\u2019s cartridge and allow them to dissolve, which usually takes a few days. Unless your pool\u2019s chlorine level is below 1 ppm or above 5 ppm, it\u2019s fine to go swimming while the tablets dissolve. They\u2019re designed for routine, continuous use. You can find chlorine dispensers online and at pool supply stores. Simple floaters are inexpensive, while skimmers that clean debris and dispense chemicals can cost hundreds of dollars (U.S.)."

If your chlorine is labeled \u201cstabilized,\u201d \u201ctrichlor,\u201d or \u201cdichlor,\u201d it already contains cyuranic acid, and there\u2019s no need to take any further action. If not, purchase liquid or granulated cyuranic acid, dilute it according to the package\u2019s instructions, then add it to the pool. The right amount to add varies by product. In general, you\u2019ll need to add about 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of cyuranic acid per 10,000 gallons (38,000 L) of water to reach a level of 10 ppm. It\u2019s recommended to maintain a cyuranic acid level around 50 ppm. Remember to wear goggles and gloves when you mix and apply pool chemicals. Do not add cyuranic acid to a spa or hot tub."

Required amounts and application methods vary, so consult an employee at the pool supply store and read your product\u2019s instructions carefully. In general, you\u2019ll need 3.5 US quarts (3.3 L) of liquid shock treatment or 1 pound (0.45 kg) of a granular product per 10,000 gallons (38,000 L) of water.

Once you\u2019ve measured and, if necessary, diluted the right amount of chemical, add it gradually to the pool. Pour it slowly as you walk around the pool\u2019s perimeter to ensure even distribution. Do not add an undiluted shock treatment directly to the water unless the product\u2019s instructions specifically call for it.Tip: You\u2019ll get more bang for your buck if you add the shock treatment at night. Ultraviolet rays break down chlorine, so the shock treatment will be less effective if you add it during the day."

If necessary, your product\u2019s instructions will direct you to add an acidic pool water amendment to counteract the shock treatment\u2019s high pH. Ask an employee at the pool supply store or consult your pool\u2019s installer about the right combination of shock treatments and pH amendments. Use products as directed, and apply them in the order advised in the instructions. It\u2019s essential to keep the pH between 7.2 and 7.8. Ideally, try to keep it right around 7.5. If it\u2019s too high, chlorine sanitizes less effectively. If the pH is too low, chlorine can corrode pipes, damage pool lining, and irritate skin."

Some shock treatments work quickly, and swimming is safe after just 15 to 20 minutes. For other products, you\u2019ll need to wait 4 to 24 hours. Always test your chlorine levels after amending the pool water before you allow anyone to go swimming. Read your product\u2019s instructions for specific wait times. Bear in mind a free available chlorine level over 10 ppm may burn the test strip and yield a false reading of 0 ppm. If that happens, retest the water after a few hours."

The combined chlorine level, or the amount of used up chlorine, should remain under 0.2 ppm. If it exceeds 0.2 ppm, it\u2019s time to shock your pool."
