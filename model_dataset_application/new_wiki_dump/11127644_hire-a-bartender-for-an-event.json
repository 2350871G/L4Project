They\u2019ll provide bartenders, mixing and serving equipment, ice, coolers, glasses, and drink mixers. You will need to provide the beer, wine, and liquor, but they will handle everything else. They will also hold any required alcohol licenses that your area or venue may require. Bartender services also often clean up afterwards. A full-service bartending service will be able to handle everyone\u2019s drink requests, will use your alcohol more efficiently than allowing people to pour their own drinks, and they\u2019re less likely to over-serve guests."
