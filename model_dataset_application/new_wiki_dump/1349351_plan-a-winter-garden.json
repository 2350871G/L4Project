          "description":"As unpleasant as it may seem to think about cold winter temperatures and snowy days in the middle of the summer, you need to start planning the garden early. This will give you enough time to have your plants in the ground before the first frost, and will prevent you from having to scramble to assemble your garden in September. If you live in the northern hemisphere, start planning in July. If you live in the southern hemisphere, start your winter garden plans in January. If you live in the American Deep South, or other regions that stay warm well into winter, you may be able to wait until August to plan your garden."

          "description":"The first frost will kill most plants, but hardy winter crops will survive the first frost if they\u2019re planted early enough. Time your plants to fully mature before that date by planting them 6-8 weeks in advance. Speak to your local garden authorities (such as the 4H extension office or master gardener club) to help you time your winter garden precisely. You can also look up the approximate first frost date online. Input your ZIP code at: https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates/states. Note that this site is specific to the U.S."

Use the blade of your spade to loosen the ground at least to a depth of 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm). Reworking the soil will make it easier for your winter plants to extend their roots into the ground and to absorb necessary nutrients."

Select a location that is blocked from the wind and receives as much sun as possible. A south-facing slope works best for a winter garden. If you don\u2019t have access to an area of soil with good water drainage, you can install a raised bed. Avoid planting outdoor winter plants in individual containers or plastic planters. Plants\u2019 roots can easily freeze in these containers, and this effectively kills the plant."

        {
          "headline":"Add compost to your soil before planting.",
          "description":"The majority of soil nutrients will have been used up by the crops and flora you planted during the spring and summer months. Add about 5 inches (13 cm) of compost or other fertile natural material to your garden. The compost will replenish nutrients and help your winter plants grow. Composted manure, alfalfa meal, or a balanced organic fertilizer are all appropriate choices. Adding compost initially will also keep you from having to fertilize crops during the winter growing season."

To avoid the monotony of only having 1 plant type, and to enrich your winter meals, plant a variety of winter crops. These include many leafy greens like:\nFrise\u00e9 (mature in 90-95 days). Arugula (mature when 4 inches (10 cm) tall). Swiss chard (mature in 60 days). Giant red mustard and Southern giant mustard (mature in 30 days). Curly leafed kale. Pick kale leaves whenever you like.

Although root crops are typically less showy on the surface, they provide substantial additions to meals made from winter-garden harvests. To keep your garden active all winter long, plant a variety of root crops that will be ready to harvest during the late, middle, and early parts of the season. Beets and carrots (mature in 90 days). Rutabaga and parsnip (mature in 90 days). Early carrots and turnips (mature in 60 days). Leeks and kohlrabi (mature in 60 days). Chives and radishes (mature in 30 days)."
