          "description":"This is especially important if you\u2019ve been touching dirty or greasy objects. Even your fingers have natural oils on them, which will leave streaks and smudges on your lenses. Only touch your glasses and lenses when you need to, and always wash your hands first. Common sources of dirt and oils that get on eyeglasses include:\nThe fur and skin of household pets\nFood products that include flour, oil, grease, or spices\nWorkplace objects, including stair railings and elevator buttons"

          "description":"If your glasses have slipped down your nose and you need to push them back up, grip the frames to do this. Never push directly on the lenses, as this will transfer grease and oils from your hands onto the lenses. Adjusting your glasses by gripping the frames will become a habit over time if you do it consistently and never adjust your glasses by pressing on the lenses."

          "description":"If you are cooking greasy foods on high heat, the hot oils will spray out of the pan, and can splatter high enough to smudge your glasses. If you need to wear your glasses while cooking, put a lid over the pot to protect yourself and your glasses from being sprayed with hot oil. If your glasses have been smudged by grease, clean them as soon as possible. Foods that are likely to splatter grease and oil while being cooked include:\nBacon or other pan-fried meats\nEggs\nAnything saut\u00e9ed, especially onions"

          "description":"The skin on your face will naturally build up oils during the day, and these can transfer to your lenses if you push your glasses up high on your face. Similarly, natural oils from your hair can leave streaks or smudges on your glasses. Wash your face regularly\u2014at least once a day\u2014to prevent oils from building up and smudging your lenses. If you have long bangs, these can carry oils as well, and potentially transfer that oil to your lenses. Pin your bangs back to prevent them from smudging your glasses."

          "description":"Windy, rainy, and dusty weather all present unique challenges for individuals who wear glasses. Be aware that your glasses will be smudged and speckled with dirt after being in a dusty or dirty environment, and will be streaked with water after a rainstorm. Take your glasses off in these environments, or avoid spending much time outdoors when the weather is windy or rainy. Although rainwater will evaporate from your glasses, it will leave behind a residue which smears the lenses. If small dust particles get stuck to your glasses, do not try to rub them off without first rinsing the lenses. Dust can permanently scratch your lenses if rubbed or pressed farther into the glass."

They can easily become smudged by oils from your face and pillow. Worse, you\u2019re at risk of breaking the frame if you roll over while wearing glasses. Even if you\u2019re only lying down to rest, take off your glasses. It\u2019s not worth the risk of rolling over and snapping the frames."

Otherwise, the makeup on the bridge of your nose is likely to smudge your glasses. Once you\u2019ve cleaned off the makeup from the spots of contact on the bridge of your nose, clean your glasses and gently scrub your nose pads.
