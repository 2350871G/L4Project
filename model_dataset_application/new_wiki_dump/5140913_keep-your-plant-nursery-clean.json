However, all materials that need to be sterilized should be cleaned before they are placed in the solution because dirt destroys the working potential of the bleach mixture (see the previous step). Bleach should only be used in areas that are well-ventilated because heavy concentrations of the substance can cause illness or even death. A solution of 1 part hydrogen peroxide to 100 parts water can also be used for sterilization purposes; this is a less toxic alternative to the bleach mixture. Imported water can be treated with chlorine at a rate of 1 ppm to render it usable for disinfecting your nursery. This treatment reduces the risk of damping off (a disease that can kill seeds before they germinate) and also keeps other harmful water borne substances from infecting nursery stock."

Leave a broom and dustpan or shop vac in the greenhouse and clean up small messes from repotting or pruning as soon as they occur. Never leave debris around the plants or on the floor. A good, thorough weekly clean-up of all surfaces and floors should keep your nursery looking neat and tidy. Do not use more water or fertilizer than is absolutely necessary.

Keeping Diseases and Pests Out of Your Nursery Cover your nursery floors in concrete or gravel.
