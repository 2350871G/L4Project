To pause an active download, press R2 on the home screen, press A to open the My Games and Apps submenu, select Queue, select the download you want to pause, and press the controller's Menu button. Select Pause Installation from the submenu."

      "headline":"Use a wired rather than wireless internet connection.",
      "description":"Connecting an Ethernet cord directly from your wireless router to your Xbox One can avoid problems related to signal strength. The Xbox One automatically recognizes the wired connection, so there's no need to update any settings when switching from wireless to wired networking. The Ethernet port on the Xbox One is on the back of the console. It's the second port from the left side, on the opposite end from the power port. Check the documentation for your wireless router to find the location of its Ethernet port. Make sure all wired connections are tight and secure. Loose connections can also have a negative effect on ping."
