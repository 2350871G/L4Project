          "description":"Decide whether you want to host the party at your home or at a different venue. Ideally, you should pick a location that fits with the luau theme. Pools, plentiful outdoor space, and BBQ areas help create a breezy luau vibe. If you want to host your party at a pool but don\u2019t have one at home, community clubhouses and parks often have pools, and can usually be reserved for a reasonable fee. If your child is under five, it may be better to hold the party at home. New environments can easily overwhelm younger children."

          "headline":"Prepare for the weather.",
          "description":"If you are hosting the party outside, take weather into account. The party date will probably be too far in advance to check the forecast, but consider the time of day. If you live in an area where it rains every afternoon in the summer, host the party in the evening. If you are afraid a rain shower might spoil your outdoor luau, it\u2019s a good idea to plan some indoor-friendly party activities just in case."

          "headline":"Go for a tropical color scheme.",
          "description":"Pick bright, tropical colors to play into the luau theme! Lime green, turquoise, bright orange, and hot pink are all great options. You can go for a rainbow scheme, or opt for more specific tropical colors. Your color scheme will help you select decorations that match. For example, you might want to focus on pinks and oranges, or greens and blues. When selecting a color scheme, consult your child or think about their favorite colors."

Spread the luau spirit by purchasing plastic or fabric leis in bulk from you local party supply store. Leis can double as a decoration and a party favor! Hang leis on tables and chairs for an instant luau feel, and give leis to kids as they arrive so everyone looks festive!"

Roasting an entire pig is probably a little ambitious for a children\u2019s party, especially since kids are picky eaters, but you can opt for easier, party-friendly pork dishes inspired by the traditional Hawaiian dish. Serve a ham baked with pineapple rings, or pulled pork sandwiches on Hawaiian sweet buns. You could even order a Hawaiian pizza for extra picky eaters! If you feel up to the challenge you can even roast a whole pig if you really want to impress."

Garnish your beverages with slices of oranges, paper umbrellas, and colorful straws. Look online for tons of fun non-alcoholic drink recipes. You might even want to serve some tropical cocktails for your fellow parents. You may want to set up a \u201cbar,\u201d where kids and adults alike can go to get fruity drinks!"
