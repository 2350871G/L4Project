          "description":"With your shirt buttoned-up, hold the gaping area together using 1 hand. Hold an open safety pin and insert your arm through the top of your shirt. Use the hand that's inside the shirt to push the pin through the inside of both shirt panels, then push it back through both panels. Secure the safety pin on the inside of your shirt to keep your shirt together. It\u2019s unlikely that people will notice the safety pin. If it's super noticeable, take it out and try inserting it again so that there's less pin visible."

Pull off a strip of fashion tape that's the length of the shirt section that gapes. Stick 1 side of the fashion tape on the inside of the panel with the buttonholes. Then, apply the other side of the fashion tape to the front side of the panel that has the buttons. Press the 2 pieces of tape together to close the gape. The fashion tape should hold for the rest of the day. However, it\u2019s not a long-term fix.Tip: Any strong double-stick tape will work!"

          "description":"The easiest way to fix a gaping shirt is to embrace the gape. Instead of trying to stop your shirt from gaping, leave the buttons open. Wear a camisole under your button-up shirt to cover up your chest or cleavage. Then, unbutton the top 1-3 buttons of your shirt if the gape is over your chest. If the shirt gapes lower down on your torso, leave it completely unbuttoned. For instance, you might wear a lace-top camisole for a feminine look. Alternatively, wear a muscle tank in place of a camisole."

Use your fabric pencil to mark the inside of the button hole panel so you know where you want to add a snap or hook-and-eye closure. Use a measuring tape to find how far from the upper button hole your mark is, then measure from the top button on the button panel to find the same spot on the other panel. Mark the front facing side of the button panel where you\u2019ll attach the other end of your snap or closure. A snap is typically easier to close, but it may pop open more easily. You might prefer a hook-and-eye enclosure if you have a very large chest."
