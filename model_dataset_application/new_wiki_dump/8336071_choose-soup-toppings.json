          "description":"Granola is a great, and often gluten-free, grain-based topping for soups. While you might not think this breakfast superstar is a good fit for your steaming mug of soup, granola adds crunch, flavor, and even a bit of protein to your otherwise run of the mill meal. Try adding a sprinkle to a wintry soup that has at least a hint of nutty flavor, like pumpkin or squash. Top spiced cauliflower soup with a nutty granola. Add some crunch to a creamy carrot soup with a handful of delicately spiced granola."

You can add a piece of your favorite toasted bread, or try prepared toasts that you can purchase at your local market or grocery store. Try toasted whole grain toast on a bowl of French onion soup. Add chunks of toasted sourdough to a cup of creamy tomato soup."

You can crumble everyday tortilla chips onto a frothy bowl of soup, or top a cup of your favorite soup with crispy tortilla strips. For those who don\u2019t want the added sodium, try topping your soup with unsalted tortilla chips or strips. Make your Mexican chicken soup crunchy with a handful of tortilla strips. Up the ante on your tomato soup with a sprinkling of crumbled tortilla chips."
