  "text":" Making the Bread Dough Dissolve yeast in a large bowl of warm water.  Stir in 4 eggs, cardamom, milk, sugar, salt and 2 cups of flour. Continue to stir until the dough is smooth. Add 3 cups of flour and continue mixing.  Add the melted butter.  Add 2-3 more cups of flour until the dough is stiff.  Take the dough out and place it on a floured bread board. Cover it with a bowl. Let it rest for 15 minutes. Knead (massage the dough with your hands) dough for about 8-10 minutes until it is smooth. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover it with a plastic wrap. Allow it to rise for 1-2 hours (until it has doubled in size). Take the dough out and punch it down. Leave the dough to rise again until it has doubled in size (30 minutes to 1 hour). Braiding the Bread Dough Place the dough out on a floured board. Divide it into 3 parts. Roll each part into 18 inch (45.7 cm)-long strands.  Braid the 3 strands together to form 1 braid. Each part should make one braid so you should end up with 3 braids. Let the braids rest for 20-30 minutes until they are puffy.  Baking the Bread Braids Brush the braids with beaten egg. Sprinkle them with sugar for flavoring and garnish. Bake for 20-30 minutes until the braids are a golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before serving.",
