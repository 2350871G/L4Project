          "description":"Wash the lemons and oranges under running water, and scrub the peels with a vegetable brush. Pat the fruits dry, and set one orange and one lemon aside. With the other lemon and orange, use a zester, vegetable peeler, or sharp knife to carefully remove the outer zest from the fruit. Place the zest into a small metal or heavy ceramic bowl. The zest pieces shouldn\u2019t be more than an inch (2.5 cm) wide if you're using a knife to zest the citrus. Avoid peeling the pith with the zest. The pith is the white part under the zest, and it can be quite bitter."

          "description":"Sprinkle the sugar over the lemon and orange zest and toss the mixture with a spoon to coat the zest with the sugar. Use a muddler, pestle, or heavy wooden spoon to gently pound the mixture. Continue pounding for a few minutes, until the citrus starts to release its oils and the mixture becomes slightly wet. Set the mixture aside for an hour. Oleo-saccharum is a nineteenth century cocktail ingredient made by combining citrus oil and sugar."

Transfer the oil and zest to a large punch bowl that will hold about 3 quarts (3 L). Pour the mandarin vodka over the oleo-saccharum and leave it for about five minutes. This will give the sugar mixture time to dissolve into the vodka."

Add 15 to 20 ice cubes, and then slowly pour the sparkling wine into the mixture. Stir the mixture gently to combine all the ingredients. Adding the sparkling wine last will help to preserve the carbonation, and make the punch light and refreshing."
