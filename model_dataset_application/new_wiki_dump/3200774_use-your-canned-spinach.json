      "description":"Warmed-up canned spinach has a wonderfully simple, refreshing taste that is complemented well with one to two tablespoons of lemon juice or red wine vinegar per can and a sprinkling of bacon (or bacon bits, for the less culinarily-inclined). Top with a little melted butter if you would like."

      "headline":"Add seasoning.",
      "description":"Canned spinach on its own is quite yummy, but can easily be enhanced using basic spices and toppings. Popular toppings include garlic powder, dry mustard, chopped tomatoes, olives, feta cheese, crushed red pepper, and bacon bits."

      "headline":"Cook it in butter with onions.",
      "description":"Although it is little more decadent than your standard heart-healthy dish, it is still highly nutritious. Saut\u00e9 a chopped onion with two tablespoons of butter until browned, then add spinach and cook through."
