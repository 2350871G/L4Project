You can check the ripeness of your pears yourself by applying gentle pressure at the top near the stem. The color of your pears alone is not a good indicator for how ripe or not ripe they are. If the flesh is hard when you press down, your pears are not ripe. If you plan to eat them a few days from now, purchasing unripe pears is perfectly fine. If the flesh slightly gives when you press down, your pears are ripe and can be eaten right away. Softness or bruising anywhere else on a pear could indicate it is overripe and will impact the taste and texture."

Fruits like pears produce a natural hormone known as ethylene during the ripening process. Placing your pears in a brown paper bag traps the hormone, allowing them to ripen at a faster rate. Placing your pears in a fruit bowl with other ethylene-producing fruits, like bananas, apples and avocados, will also speed up the ripening process."
