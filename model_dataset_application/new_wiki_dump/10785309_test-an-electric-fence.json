If you have an electric fence, it's definitely worth the $30-$50 USD investment. Most models include a handheld meter with a digital readout and a metal prong on the top, and an attached metal probe at the end of a wire."

By checking the voltage at the furthest point from it, you can be confident that the proper voltage is coursing through the fence. Refer to the owner's manual or signage on the charger to determine the correct voltage range for your fence. Depending on the type of animals they are meant to control, electric fence voltages typically range from 2,000 to 10,000 volts."

          "headline":"Touch the meter's probe to the ground wire, if there is one.",
          "description":"If the fence has 2 or more wires, one of them is probably a ground wire. Use your owner's manual to identify it. If you're not sure, or if there is no ground wire on your type of fence, skip this step and move on to the step that describes sticking the probe into the ground. Keep your hand on the plastic or rubber section of the probe, not the metal tip. Otherwise, your body (instead of the meter) will test the electric fence when you touch the other probe end to it! Some types of fencing ground directly into the earth instead of using a ground wire. If necessary, contact the fence manufacturer or an electrician so you can identify the ground wire properly in the future. It's also good to have an expert make sure your ground wire is connected properly, as poor grounding is a major cause of electric fence malfunctions."

          "description":"If your fence model doesn't use a ground wire, just stick the metal end of the probe several inches/centimeters deep into the soil. You can also do this if you're not sure which wire on the fence is the ground wire. Stick as much of the metal tip of the probe into the ground as you can. Make sure you're not touching the metal tip with your fingers when you do the test, though! All single wire fences ground directly into the soil, but some multi-wire fences also lack a grounding wire."

          "description":"With the probe still touching the ground wire or stuck in the soil, touch the metal prong on the tester to one of the charged wires. The digital readout should give you a voltage reading. Compare this reading to the recommended voltage for your fence model. Repeat the test on each fence wire. The readouts are often in thousands, in which case a reading of 5.0 indicates 5000 volts. If the reading is above or below the recommended range for your fence, there is a problem with it and it should be serviced. If you don't get any reading, make sure you turned the voltmeter on! If the meter is on, that means the fence has no charge."

And, even if the voltage reading is good on your first test, repeating the test in other locations will confirm the result. Just walk along the fence and, every 100 ft (30 m) or so, quickly repeat the test again."

If you get within a few inches/centimeters of the fence wire(s) and the meter still doesn't light up and beep, you can be confident that there isn't voltage in the area. Keep in mind that non-contact voltmeters don't give you any information about the amount of voltage, they only reveal if there is or isn't any voltage coursing through the fence. Use an electric fence voltmeter if you want specific voltage readings."

Walk the length of the fence while remaining within about 3\u20135 ft (0.91\u20131.52 m) of it. Either point the meter at it constantly, or at intervals of around 50\u2013100 feet (15\u201330 m). If you get the \"on\" indicator (lights and beeping) in some sections of fence and \"off\" in other sections, follow up with an electric fence voltmeter (if you have one) to see if you get variable voltage readings along the fence.

If the wire is charged, the magnetic field created by the charge should cause the compass arrow to vibrate. For the best results, hold the compass near each wire for 10-30 seconds.

If you can, you'll know the fence is electrified. Not hearing anything, however, doesn't guarantee that the fence is off. You may simply be unable to hear any sounds caused by the pulses. A fence that buzzes, hums, or crackles noticeably likely has a short somewhere in the system. Have a qualified repair person inspect the fence."

Touch the screwdriver to each wire on the fence and watch for an electric arc that will leap from the wire to the screwdriver. If you don't notice any arcing immediately, run the screwdriver back and forth over the wire for 10-30 seconds. If there's still no arcing, the wire most likely has no charge.
