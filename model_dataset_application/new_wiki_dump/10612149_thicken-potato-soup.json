          "headline":"Add a roux to add the most thickness to your soup.",
          "description":"A roux is made by heating up equal parts flour and fat to add body and flavor to a dish. To thicken about 1  qt (0.95 L), melt 2 tbsp (28 g) of butter in a skillet, then whisk in 2 tbsp (30 g) of flour. Continue cooking the mixture, stirring constantly, until it's a blond color, or just starting to darken. Then, stir the roux into your soup just before it's finished cooking. If you want to add a nutty flavor to your soup, cook the roux until it's about the color of peanut butter. However, a lighter roux will thicken your soup more effectively. Since you're not baking with it, you can use either self-rising or all-purpose flour to thicken your soup."

          "headline":"Make a slurry with cornstarch or flour for a very thin soup.",
          "description":"Whisk 2 tbsp (25 g) of cornstarch or 2 tbsp (30 g) of flour with \u20444 cup (59 mL) of cool water. Once the starch is completely dissolved, pour the slurry into the main pot. Heat the soup to boiling for 1 minute, then reduce the heat and simmer until the soup is as thick as you\u2019d like it. By mixing the flour or cornstarch with cool water before adding it to the soup, you\u2019ll keep it from clumping up when it hits the hot liquid. This will thicken about 1  qt (0.95 L) of soup. Tip: Cornstarch will thicken your soup more than flour, but both are a good option if you need to thicken a very thin soup."

        {
          "headline":"Pour in 1 cup (60 g) of instant potato flakes for a quick fix.",
          "description":"This will add extra potato flavor to your soup, so you don't have to worry about changing the taste. Add the instant potatoes to your soup at the end while it's simmering, then cover the pot and wait about 5 minutes. This will thicken about 2  qt (1.9 L) of soup, and these potato flakes will add a lot of body. Adjust the proportion as you need to."

        {
          "headline":"Make a beurre manie from butter and flour to thicken the soup at the end.",
          "description":"To thicken about 1  qt (0.95 L) of soup, take 2 tbsp (28 g) of softened butter and 2 tbsp (30 g) of flour and place them in a bowl, then knead them together with your hands. When the mixture is completely combined, it should be crumbly. Add in the crumbles a little at a time to your hot soup, right before it\u2019s finished cooking, until it reaches the desired consistency. Beurre manie is a French technique that\u2019s similar to making a roux. The butter coats the individual grains of flour, which is why they won't lump up when you add them to hot soup. This will add a moderate amount of thickness to your soup."

          "description":"Tear up 3-4 slices of bread into large chunks. Then, use a ladle to spoon some of the soup into a bowl. Add in the chunks of bread and let them dissolve, then puree them in a blender or a food processor. Pour the mixture back into the soup and stir it well. You should see the effect right away. You may want to remove the crusts if you're using French bread or another bread with a flaky crust, as it may not completely dissolve. However, since you're pureeing it, you may choose to leave the crusts on if you prefer. Stale bread will thicken the soup more than fresh loaves. This should give you about 2 cups (75-100 g) of bread crumbs, which will thicken 1  qt (0.95 L) of soup."

          "description":"Adding cream to your soup will help thicken it, and it will give the potato soup a creamy, silky texture. In addition, the cream adds a rich flavor that goes perfectly with potato soup. Measure the cream into a bowl, then add a little of the hot soup to the bowl to temper it, or to bring it gently up to temperature. Then, pour the mixture back into the soup and stir well. The amount you add will depend on how much soup you made and how much you need to thicken it. Start with 1\u20132 US tbsp (15\u201330 mL), then add more if you need to. If your soup is very watery, adding another liquid will only help so much. You may want to consider adding a roux or another starch instead. Tip: Do not boil the soup after you add dairy, or it may curdle."

Temper the yogurt by mixing it with a little of the hot soup before you pour it in, which should keep it from curdling. The taste of the yogurt especially suits potato soups containing a sharp cheese like cheddar. Since yogurt affects the taste of the soup, this approach may be best for thickening individual servings."
