      "description":"Beaches are not the best place to be setting up a barbecue, so the best option is to make sure that you select food that tastes wonderful when it is cold and to make sure that the flavours across the meal complement each other well. Some great choices for a beach picnic include:\nSpreads and dips with crusty bread\nMarinated vegetables\nQuiche\nPasta and rice salads\nFruit salad or whole fruit\nSlices of cake, cookies or brownies"
