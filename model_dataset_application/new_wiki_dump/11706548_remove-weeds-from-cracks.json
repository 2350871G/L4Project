          "description":"Bring a large pot of water to a boil on the stove. Then, carefully pour the boiling water over the leaves and stems of the weeds, as well as in the cracks surrounding the base of the plants.The heat from the water will cause the plants to start to wilt immediately, and will kill the roots over the following days or weeks. Boiling water is a great option because it easily gets into the cracks and doesn\u2019t leave harmful residue in the soil. This method is generally most effective on young weeds."

          "headline":"Spray a salt and dish soap solution on the weeds to kill them.",
          "description":"Dissolve 1 part table salt or rock salt to 8 parts of hot water. Then, stir in a quarter-sized squirt of dish soap and pour the solution into a spray bottle. Spray the solution over the weeds carefully and try to avoid getting any on nearby soil, plants, or pavement to prevent damage.Repeat this process every few weeks as needed until the weeds have died and stopped sprouting. The salt and dish soap solution can discolor and erode cement and kill the surrounding plants. For a quick and easy option, sprinkle rock salt or table salt on the weeds to kill them. This is less effective for stubborn weeds, though."

          "description":"Pour white vinegar into a spray bottle and douse the weeds with it. You can also simply pour the vinegar directly from the bottle onto the weeds.Most regular white vinegar is about 5% acetic acid and will get the job done. However, for stubborn weeds, you may need to get horticultural vinegar that's 20% acetic acid. Horticultural vinegar is available at most gardening stores. Adding a quarter-sized squirt of dish soap to the vinegar may make it more effective."

Then, apply the solution directly to the unwanted weeds and into the cracks around the weeds. You can use a spray bottle to apply the solution or pour it directly onto the plants from the bowl.Borax can irritate your skin, so you may want to wear gloves when handling the solution."

If you spilled any baking soda around the cracks, use your hands or a brush to sweep it into the cracks so that none is wasted. Repeat this process every 4 to 6 weeks until the weeds are gone.Apply baking soda in the spring and fall to new, young weeds for the best results."

Follow the instructions on the label to apply the liquid over the weeds. For easier application, you can dilute some concentrated herbicides with water in a spray bottle. Check the instructions to see how to dilute the liquid and how much to spray on the weeds.If the weed killer you\u2019re using contains chemicals that are harmful to humans, wear protective glasses, long-sleeves, and gloves to protect your skin and eyes from exposure. It takes about 2 weeks for commercial liquid weed killers to kill off the weeds."
