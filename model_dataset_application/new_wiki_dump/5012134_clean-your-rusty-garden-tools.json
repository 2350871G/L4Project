It also helps to keep them rust-free, as clean tools tend to be exposed to less moisture. It may seem fussy, but wiping your pruning blade with a full-strength household cleaner (such as Pine-Sol or Lysol) between cutting each piece of plant matter will help  to prevent the spread of infection. It\u2019s especially important to clean your tools if they have been in contact with setting agents such as concrete that will dull the edge of spades and blades if left to harden."

          "description":"Keeping garden tools sharp will make them safer easier to use. Although it seems counterintuitive, a sharper blade can be safer as it requires less force and is less likely to slip. Additionally, when cutting through the cells on your plant with something like a pair of secateurs, a sharp blade will cause less cell damage and won\u2019t crush as many cells as a blunt blade. This will help the plant heal faster, which lessens the risk of infection setting in from fungi or the weather."

Don\u2019t delay if you've been using the tool for any setting or drying agents such as cement, sealant or paint. If your tool has any setting agents on it then it will need to be cleaned quickly before these have a chance to dry. After using the brush to get the dirt off, rinse in running water and leave to dry. This can take as long as overnight if the tool has complicated surfaces which retain moisture. Afterwards you can wipe a light coating of mineral or motor oil over your tools."

Be sure to clean the residue away with plenty of clean water after soaking. Citric acid is available in small quantities in the grocery or winemaking store or try your local agricultural store as it\u2019s used by pig keepers (and may be cheaper to buy in quantity there).

If you are using a whetstone, start by wetting it thoroughly. You can use mineral/motor oil if you prefer instead of water. Without pressing especially hard, stroke the whetstone in one direction along the side of the edge. Replenish either oil or water as required if the stone surface dries out.
