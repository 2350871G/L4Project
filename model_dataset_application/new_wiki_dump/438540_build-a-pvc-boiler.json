Aluminium pipe is a good choice, but again the cost is just too much for this project. Conduct is another possible pipe and cheaper, but it will rust if you just talk about water in front of it."

          "headline":"Look at PVC, it's cheap in cost and light in weight, but will it hold up to the task at hand, this was a big part of the research and reasoning for deciding which pipe would do the job and be at a reasonable low cost.",
          "description":"This white pipe just doesn't look like it would do the job at first glance, but with a bit of the proper drawings and instructions as offered here, you will find it to be a good choice for this project. Most of the info on PVC pipe and its properties comes from the \"AWWA Research Foundation\" in Denver, Colorado, 1994. This info will lead you to more info and you will began to see how diverse this stuff (PVC) really is. If your first thoughts on the use of PVC are of schedule 80, than take a good look at the cost of schedule 80 pvc and the fitting that must be used with it, oh, don't forget that schedule 80 has to have it's own type of cleaner and cement also. So it's on to the next, schedule 40 and its fittings which work very well for this project and at a cost you can live with. It should be noted here that when your using PVC that you should use the proper PVC fittings of the same schedule and the proper cleaners and cement for that type of pvc. The clear cleaner that goes with the schedule 40 works very well and without the mess of the purple stuff, it just leaves you with a much better looking project. Keep in mind that learning about PVC and finding it has everything you need and works much better than you might expect. A few large white sticky balls were produced while trying different methods of building this boiler, but experimenting proved that the proper placement and type of fittings along with the lengths and the type of heating element made the system work very well and not turn into that white sticky ball. The trick here is to make something that works not just once, but time after time, safely and without any problems."

  "text":" Getting Started Know the things when looking for the material to build this boiler. You will find the cost of steel pipe, copper or schedule 80 PVC and their fittings are not in the \"cost\" ball park for this project. Aluminium pipe is a good choice, but again the cost is just too much for this project. Conduct is another possible pipe and cheaper, but it will rust if you just talk about water in front of it. Look at PVC, it's cheap in cost and light in weight, but will it hold up to the task at hand, this was a big part of the research and reasoning for deciding which pipe would do the job and be at a reasonable low cost. This white pipe just doesn't look like it would do the job at first glance, but with a bit of the proper drawings and instructions as offered here, you will find it to be a good choice for this project. Most of the info on PVC pipe and its properties comes from the \"AWWA Research Foundation\" in Denver, Colorado, 1994. This info will lead you to more info and you will began to see how diverse this stuff (PVC) really is. If your first thoughts on the use of PVC are of schedule 80, than take a good look at the cost of schedule 80 pvc and the fitting that must be used with it, oh, don't forget that schedule 80 has to have it's own type of cleaner and cement also. So it's on to the next, schedule 40 and its fittings which work very well for this project and at a cost you can live with. It should be noted here that when your using PVC that you should use the proper PVC fittings of the same schedule and the proper cleaners and cement for that type of pvc. The clear cleaner that goes with the schedule 40 works very well and without the mess of the purple stuff, it just leaves you with a much better looking project. Keep in mind that learning about PVC and finding it has everything you need and works much better than you might expect. A few large white sticky balls were produced while trying different methods of building this boiler, but experimenting proved that the proper placement and type of fittings along with the lengths and the type of heating element made the system work very well and not turn into that white sticky ball. The trick here is to make something that works not just once, but time after time, safely and without any problems. Always be aware of safety issues. The utmost issue here is safety. This system has been in use for about 1-1/2 years now (at the time of writing this article)and without any problems, when testing the boiler during the construction of this system the results need to show no leaks. (After construction is complete and cement has cured for 24hrs.) Be sure that there is no over heating of the boiler at any point and do all this with complete safety. And no interruption of the steaming when water is added during the steaming process. Here is where one must be ones own keeper, think before you act, if you don't know about something or are unsure, ask questions and get answers! Note: The PVC boiler is built in three stages, first is the 90 degree inlet and its fittings, second, the santee and its fittings, along with the heating element and third, the riser with its clear PVC braided hose and all of its fittings.  Attach the system to the platform which is a 2'x4' sheet of 3/4\" plywood or OSB. Building a 2x4\" frame under the platform with locking wheels to make it both portable and keep it in place when in use. Note: Never move the platform and system when in use, as this is unsafe for you and the system! Start with the 3\" PVC pipe and fittings, stage one, the 3\" 90 degree inlet, this is the bottom end of the boiler, this is where the water supply first enters the boiler through reducer fittings and a 3/4\" PVC hose.  A short 3\" PVC nipple (3\" pvc pipe cut to about 2\" long) is used at the lower end of the 90 degree fitting and between the 3\" to 2\" hub reducer by using of the cleaner and cement for the schedule 40 PVC. Now add the 2\" to 3/4\" PVC reducer into the 3\" to 2\" hub reducer, the 2\" to 3/4\" reducer has a 3/4\" threaded hole to except the 3/4\" hose barb, this hose barb can be steel, brass or nylon. Note: Do not use the cleaner or cement on the hose barb, Use only the teflon tape on the threads of the hose barb. Add the short PVC nipple at the top end of the 90 degree fitting, this is where the 8 long 3 pvc pipe is set and the santee will be fitted to the top of the 8' long pvc pipe. Santee stands for sanitary fitting. The santee is a 3 pvc pipe with a Tee fitting built into the middle of it. Note: More info and drawings show this arrangement in more detail on the plans sheet. Assemble the santee fitting,(the santee is a 3\"pvc pipe with a 90 degree opening in the middle of it) this is done in two stages, one adding the 3 to 2\" hub reducer to the santee, the 90 degree opening  with the short nipple (as used above) between the 90 degree opening and the hub reducer. Add a threaded 2\" to 1-1/4\" PVC reducer, with the 1-1/4\" hole threaded, in the hub reducer. Insert the 1500 watt 120VAC short water heating element into a hole made in the weatherproof electrical box. Be sure to put the rubber o-ring/gasket on the element before installing it. The electrical box, use a good weatherproof box that has a gasket around the lid or cover, this box should be of metal with ground screw. Cut a hole in the back side of the weatherproof electrical box for the heating element with the o-ring/gasket to pass through. Note: the connection end of the heating element goes inside of the electrical box. The hole in the electric box should be just large enough for the element to fit into and let the o-ring seat against the inside of the electrical box. Add the teflon tape to the threads of the heating element and set it into the weatherproof electrical box.  Screw the 1-1/4\"-1\" steel reducer that is threaded inside and out onto the heating element. #Apply the teflon tape to the outside threads of this reducer. With the element, gasket, weatherproof box and steel reducer fully assembled, screw this assembly into the 1-1/4\" PVC reducer in the hub reducer on the santee. When adding the 12/3 electrical cord Be sure the weatherproof electrical box has a ground screw connection in it, connect the ground wire on the 12/3 electrical cord to this ground screw in the box. This is a must, it will help insure a safe system! Add the 1/2\" cord grip connector to the bottom of the electrical box. This connection at the bottom of the electrical box helps keep water from entering. Connection of the 12/3 cord is done after the boiler is complete to prevent damaging the cord while you build the system. Again, think about safety. Add the riser to the top opening of the santee. The riser is just a 14\" long 3\" PVC pipe with a 3\" to 2\" hub reducer and a 2 hose barb that the steam hose attaches to. Add the clear braided PVC hose to the hose barb to complete the riser assembly, don't cut the hose to length until the steam box is in place.  When installing the hose, use no smaller than a  2 hose at the top of the riser for the best steam flow to the steam box.  The Clear PVC braided hose attaches to this hose barb and will go up and into the bottom of the steam box, don't cut this hose to length until the steam box has been finished and installed on the platform.  All these parts for this boiler, except for the steel fittings are bonded with the PVC cleaner and cement. Use this cleaner and cement as directed by the instructions on the cans. The steel reducers all use Teflon tape on the threaded areas, no cleaner or cement on the steel fittings.This method makes for a very leak proof system. The 90 degree inlet fitting at the bottom of this boiler has a 3/4\" hose that is attached to it and runs out and up to the through the tank connector on the supply thank. This hose should be about 16-18\" long. One of the things that makes this boiler more efficient than a can on a gas burner, is that you can add water to the supply tank and not interrupt the steaming process. You can get a constant steam flow for as long as you want. Hold the finished PVC boiler in place ( on the 2'x4' plywood platform) with the use of an upright 2x4  and steel pipe clamps attaching the boiler to the 2x4 upright and attaching the 2x4 upright to the platform with 2x4 bracing.  This PVC boiler works very well, but before using this system, ensure that there will be no pressure build up, no water leaks and the electrical connections are correct and the ground wire connected.  It's a good idea to leak test the boiler by plugging the 3/4\" inlet hole (at the bottom end of the boiler) and filling the boiler with water and standing it upright, then let it set for 24 hours, if there are no leaks, proceed with the construction of the system. A complete drawing of the finished boiler with bracing is shown on the plans The Supply Tank The Supply Tank is a plastic container of about 5 US gallons with a smooth bottom.  Use a 3/4\" Through the Tank Connector with its seals on the inside and outside. This connector is at tractor supply. Do not glue or screw the supply tank to the supply stand. It is kept in place by the weight of the water in the tank. Set the supply tank on the supply stand, the supply stand is a 2x4 box frame with a 18\" square piece of plywood on top of this 2x4 frame and a 3\" hole in the center of the plywood  for the  Through the tank connector to pass through. Keep the top of the supply stand about 14\" ABOVE the platform or high enough that when the supply tank is set in place the supply tank full level line, lines up with the full level point on the boiler when it is standing in place alongside the supply stand and supply tank. This will ensure a proper water level in the boiler at all times. To ensure the proper water level, put a full line on the supply tank down about 3\" from the top of the supply tank and level with the full point of the boiler, this point on the boiler is about 3\" below the inside top of the hub reducer on top of the boiler. Now add a fill level line on the supply tank, down about 3\" from the full line. This makes it possible to steam wood for up to 3-4 hours without having to add water to the supply thank. Room temp. water is added to the supply tank when the supply tank level is at the refill line. Again, check to ensure that the supply tank full line is about 3\" below the hub reducer at the top of the boiler. This helps keep the water level inside the boiler at a safe level and gives max steam. Add water to the supply tank by pouring room temp water into the supply tank slowly, not to over disturb the flow of water to the boiler. This lets you add water and not interrupt the steaming. Produce enough steam for a steam box up to 10 ft long. Your projects may need a longer or larger inside area steam box. It is possible to use up to a 20 ft steam box, this is done by using 4\" PVC for the boiler, same method, just larger PVC fittings and pipe along with a longer heating element of the same wattage. Building the Steam Box Do a bit of reading and research on steam boxes; it will lead you to find that you can build most any type steam box you need. Building the steam box is a matter of what you need and what your building. This method below is just one idea, build what fits your needs best. One method is to Use 1x8 cedar boards for the sides, the using 1/2\" marine plywood for the top and bottom makes a nice box. The door on the box should not have any latches or locks, a loose fit here is important. Foam/glass insulation can be used to cover the outside of the box. Keep the wood up off the bottom of the steam box by using 3/4\"  dowel rods through 3/4\" holes through the upper sides of the box and about 2\" or so down from the top of the box. This gives you a place to lay your wood to be steamed and keeps it up close to the top of the box where the most steam and heat exist. A hole or two in the back bottom of the box is needed to let the condensate drain as your steaming wood, just make these holes small about 1/4\" dia. Set the steam box at a slight upward angle upward at the front (about 1\") to induce a good steam flow from back to front.Make the door and leave a 1/4\" gap at the top of the door on the steam box. This gap ensures good steam flow from back to front and no pressure build up. Do not add any locks or latches to the door, it should have a loose fit. A loose fit ensures no pressure build up. Pressure inside the steam box is dangerous, don't let this happen. There are many methods to generate steam and make steam boxes and most work fine, this is just one method that is safe, easy, and reliable to use and will last a long time. Check out PVC and build a great PVC steam boiler and complete wood-steaming system. The steam box can also be built of PVC but you must support the long PVC pipe along it's length to prevent sagging. Remember keep safety as your most important part of the project.",
