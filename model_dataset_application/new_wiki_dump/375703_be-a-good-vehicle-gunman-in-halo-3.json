Sometimes the prompt doesn't appear, but you can still enter."

This is particularly helpful in hectic situations where you are under fire and need to move."

      "description":"In most cases, the driver's word is final - if they say to shoot left or right, then they probably have spotted a serious threat that needs eliminating so unless you're shooting at a guy with a laser or missile pod, turn where ever the driver says. Try not to tell him to back around if you've missed an opponent as they'll most likely be expecting that, so let the driver do what they have to. Over time, you'll create a code or understanding between you and your vehicle co-occupants."

This can be hard if the driver is moving erratically, but it should get easier over time. Different guns have different powers and firing rates, so learn how to use each one."
