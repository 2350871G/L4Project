Review the possible shapes available on the market, and choose the one you like best. If buying a diamond for someone else, ask his/her opinion before selecting a shape, or bring a trusted friend/family member. Select a popular, classic shape if you have no one to ask. The most popular shapes are round brilliant, princess, and cushion cut. Consider a non-traditional shape if the receiver has a non-traditional personality. Also, note that less common shapes can be 30%, for the same karat weight and quality! Less common shapes that are still fairly popular include marquise, oval, pear, and heart."

Ask the jeweler to see the Gemological Institute of America's (GIA\u2019s) diamond grading report for any diamond you consider purchasing. This report will give you a rough grade on cut:\nSelect an \"Ideal Cut\" diamond for the highest level of perfection. Choose a \"Very Good\" or \"Excellent\" grade diamond for a slightly less expensive yet high-quality stone. Consider a \"Good\" grade if you want to balance the other C's and still stick to a budget. Never purchase a fair to poor quality diamond, especially for engagement rings and other gifts. Diamonds at these levels severely lack brilliance."

Chevrons are of particular importance when considering the princess cut diamonds. These are the facets at the pavilion side of the diamond surrounding the main pavilion. Most princess cuts have two, three or four chevrons. The more the chevrons, the more the light gets reflected upon. There is no \"right\" number of chevrons, just personal preference. More chevrons lead to a more multifaceted look, whereas less has a smoother look."

          "description":"Since most tints are extremely difficult to see, a higher grade for color does not make much difference in quality. It can, however, make a huge difference in price. Select a D grade (blue white) for an absolutely colorless diamond only if the price is of no concern. Look E or F diamonds (\"ice white\" or \"fine white,\" respectively) if you cannot afford a D grade diamond but still want a stone that is colorless with any band, on any skin tone. Diamonds rated H, I, and G are considered white, with H representing the top quality white. Note that, while these diamonds appear completely colorless, they do have a light yellow tint against a bright white background. That said, this tint disappears when set into a metal band, as no metal is solid white. Though still white or colorless against most backgrounds, J - M diamonds run from \"top silver\" (J) to \"light cape\" (M), a cheaper silver coloring. When set on a colored band like gold, they appear colorless, though they may have a tint on whiter metals like platinum."

On rare occasions, strong fluorescence can alter the appearance of a diamond's color, sometimes causing it to look milky or oily. Consider a diamond with medium fluorescence or strong fluorescence if on a tight budget, since these diamonds are often discounted."

People often choose common karat weights, which are known in the industry as \u2018magic weights\u2019. Because they are common, the price of diamonds at these weights is usually disproportionately higher than diamonds just below the magic weight e.g. a 0.98 karat diamond may be significantly less expensive than a 1 karat diamond, with no visible difference in size."

Metals like gold, silver and platinum are not only beautiful but last long for years. Choosing among them is usually a balance of beauty and budget. Gold is perhaps the most common band, as it looks great with any stone or skin tone. Look for gold and its variants like yellow, rose and white gold to further customize the ring to your hand. Silver is yet another metal that is affordable and suits almost every skin tone. Out of the various variants of silver, sterling silver is the best comprising of 92.5 percent pure silver, and 7.5 percent mixed alloys. As such, it is the most affordable and a durable ring band option. You can go for platinum bands if budget is not a problem for them.
