If the temperatures in your area fall below 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C), then it might be best to plant the cinnamon indoors. You don't have to keep a potted cinnamon indoors year-round. You can keep it outside and bring it in only when the temperatures drop below 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C)."

If this is an indoor tree, a south-facing window would be ideal because the sunlight would be stronger. If you are keeping the tree indoors and live in the southern hemisphere, a north-facing window would be better."

If the soil isn't labeled as \"well-draining,\" ensure that it contains soil, sand, and perlite. This particular combination will allow the soil to drain well. For an outdoor tree, you need enough soil to fill a 4 ft (1.2 m) square area. For an indoor tree, you need enough to fill a 24 by 20 in (61 by 51 cm) pot."

Purchase a pH testing kit from a nursery, then use it to test the soil's pH\nIf the pH is too high, cover the soil with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of sphagnum peat, then work the peat into the first 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) of soil. It is unlikely that the pH will be lower than 4.5, but if it is, mix some limestone into the soil."
