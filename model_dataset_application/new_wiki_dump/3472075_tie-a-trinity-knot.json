  "text":" Tying the Trinity Knot Raise your shirt collar and drape the tie around your neck. Position the wide end at the length you'd like it ultimately to be, as you will primarily use the narrow end for tying. The narrow end will be lower than the wide end because this knot uses a significant amount of fabric. One inch (2.5 centimeters) above your waistline is a great spot for the wide end. Pinch the wide side of the tie to form a dimple. While pinching is not essential, it does make working with the narrow end easier without the fabric bunching up. The area you should pinch is somewhere between your shirt's first and second buttons. Cross the narrow end over the wide end. Make the cross distinct so you don't accidentally mistake one end for the other. Then, bring the thin end up through the neck opening and down toward the right side. Cross the thin end under the wide end and bring it to the other side of your tie. Then, bring the narrow end up through the necktie and pull it down, to the right. At this point, there should be a v- or heart-shaped loop around your neck. Move the narrow end across the v-shaped loop. Bring the narrow end up through the neck loop and pull it through the loop. Keep this top loop of the knot loose, and move the narrow end behind the thick end to the other side of your shirt. Lift the narrow end up through the loop one more time. Adjust the loose loop for tightness until it is secure. Once the loop looks symmetric, tuck the end under the neckline to finish the trinity knot. Fold your shirt collar down to complete the look. Styling with a Trinity Knot Wear a trinity knot at lighthearted occasions. Trinity knots are not the best idea if you're making an important impression, like at a job interview or court hearing.
