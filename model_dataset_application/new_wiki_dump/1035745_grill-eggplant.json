          "description":"Large globe eggplants (with a deep purple color) are the most common variety, and are what you will find in most supermarkets. You should select an eggplant that is firm and glossy and which also has a nice heft to it. You should also examine the stem of an eggplant before selecting it: choose those which have bright green, fresh looking stems and caps. In the past, eggplants had a bit of bad reputation as being a bitter vegetable, but most varieties available now have been bred to be much more mild. Even so, many chefs recommend that you select smaller, younger eggplants to ensure that your final dish will not be bitter."

          "description":"Other varieties you might want to experiment with include Italian eggplants, which are quite similar to the large purple globes, but which tend to be smaller and slimmer. You can also find Japanese eggplants (a small purple variety) or Chinese eggplants (also small, but which are a paler violet color) at specialty markets or farmer's markets. If you can find them, try the very small Thai eggplants, which are green, round, and well-suited to being cooked whole."

Once you bring them home, you should store them whole in the refrigerator and use within two days.Eggplant will become more bitter the longer you wait between picking/selecting it and cooking it."

Peel with a paring knife or a sharp vegetable peeler, and be prepared to cook the eggplant fairly soon after (the flesh will quickly discolor once peeled). If you've chosen a smaller, younger eggplant, then toughness and bitterness should not be a problem. The skin lends a heartiness to the dish as well as a pleasing color contrast."

Experiment with different slicing techniques: the easiest preparation is to cut the eggplant into rounds. You can also cut the eggplant in half length-wise and grill the two halves (or planks). This will work best on eggplants that are not too large and thick. Once halved, you should make shallow cuts with your knife on the flesh side of the eggplant. This will help ensure that the eggplant halves cook evenly throughout."

For a gas grill, preheat the grill and once hot, reduce the heat to medium. Place the eggplant slices directly on the grill, cover, and cook for 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally until the center is soft and the skin is crisp.

Turn the eggplant occasionally and leave it on the grill until the skin has blackened and collapsed.This should take about 20-30 minutes, but will vary depending upon the size of your eggplant and the heat of your grill. Once cooled, cut the eggplant in half and drain any liquid. Remove the peel and mash the flesh of the eggplant (or use a food processor to get a smooth consistency).

After you've washed and cut your eggplant slices, prepare a garlic-infused olive oil mix by blending 1/3 cup of olive oil with 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of finely minced fresh herbs to this olive oil mixture. You can use whatever you have on hand, but good options are parsley, rosemary, thyme, or basil (or any combination).

Consider adding an additional topping of fresh diced tomatoes and basil after you've removed the eggplant from the grill. You could also place slices of fresh mozzarella on the eggplant in the final few minutes of grilling. Cover with a lid to ensure that the mozzarella melts completely.
