          "description":"Talk to the grad about what they enjoy, their dreams or aspirations, their school\u2019s mascot--anything having to do with graduation and your grad in particular! If coming up with a theme and decorating for one feels too complicated, just come up with a simple color scheme instead. If you want to try for a more focused theme, consider ideas like:\nNautical or All Around the World, for a grad who\u2019s looking forward to traveling. You could include sailboats, fish, and other nautical decorations. Oh, the Places You\u2019ll Go!, for a cute, general graduation theme centered around the popular Dr. Seuss book. Decorate with bright, pastel colors and pictures of characters from the book. Safari Adventure, especially if the grad\u2019s school has an animal mascot. You could decorate with stuffed animals and safari accessories, like hats and sunglasses. Something to do with the city or school they\u2019re going to next--Hollywood Glam if they\u2019re moving to California, for example, with glittery stars and film reels. A theme centered around their high school life. For example, a baseball theme for a baseball player, or a music theme for a grad that was in band."

          "headline":"Choose a color scheme based on the grad\u2019s school.",
          "description":"If the grad is in high school, you might choose to decorate in their high school colors, but you could also deck the party out in the colors of their new college. Choose whichever one the grad likes most, or do a mix of them both! You can also go with something even simpler, like the grad\u2019s favorite colors. To combine both color schemes without clashing, use them on separate tables, or use one scheme indoors and the other outdoors. Try to get a mix of 3 colors per color scheme so you have a few shades to work with. If the school only uses 1-2 colors, use white or black as the third."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use tissue paper numbers to highlight their grad year.",
          "description":"Cut big block numbers out of foam board with sharp scissors. Cut your tissue paper into squares of 2 inches (5.1 cm). Pinch one square of tissue paper, and dip the middle, folded part into a small pool of liquid glue, then stick it on a foam number. Repeat until the numbers are totally covered, then let dry for an hour. You can hang your tissue paper numbers on a wall or prop them up on a table. You can also push sticks into the bottom of the foam board and stand them up in tall glasses side-by-side. Fill the glasses halfway with sand for extra stability. Get 2-3 different tissue paper colors and dot them randomly over the board for a fun, textured look."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use tassel garlands as bunting on the walls.",
          "description":"Fold 1-2 sheets of tissue paper lengthwise, then twice widthwise. Cut long strips from the bottom of the paper up towards the fold, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space before the fold. Unfold the paper once, cut it down the middle widthwise, and open up the sheets. Roll up the paper so that the tassels are sticking out on both sides, twist it in the middle, and make a loop. String it up on a cord and repeat until the cord has 6-7 tassels on it. One sheet of tissue paper will turn into 4 tassels, so you won\u2019t need to buy a ton of tissue paper. When you\u2019re done, your bunting will look like the tassels that attach to a graduation cap. Hang it up on a wall or table as a festive decoration."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Blow up balloons in school colors.",
          "description":"Head to your local party supply store and buy a pack of balloons in each of the colors in your color scheme. Get help from family and neighbors to blow them up, then attach a long ribbon to each and tie them together in big bunches. You can also tie them onto the ends of tables, chairs, or trees. You can also buy clear balloons and sprinkle a couple pinches of glitter into each before blowing them up. Shake the balloon a bit to distribute the glitter for a sparkly addition to your balloon bouquet! Make sure that none of your guests have latex allergies before buying your balloons. If they do, you can buy shiny, crinkly latex-free balloons instead. Some colleges sell balloons with their logo on them. Check online to see if your grad\u2019s college does!"

Set them up on tables or walls around the party to inspire the grad and their guests! You could choose bright, catchy quotes, like from Dr. Seuss\u2019 \u201cOh, the Places You\u2019ll Go!\u201d: \u201cYou\u2019re off to Great Places! Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting. So\u2026 get on your way!\u201d\nYou could also choose more serious quotes, such as this one from Henry David Thoreau: \u201cGo confidently in the direction of your dreams. Live the life you have imagined.\u201d\nYou can find chalk and chalkboards at craft stores and online. Look for chalkboards outlined in a matching color and choose simple white chalk for a clean look."

Set out funny props, like graduation caps, big sunglasses, and fake mustaches, for guests to wear in their pictures. You can set up a timed camera on a tripod, or you can let guests use their own cameras and phones to take pictures. For added entertainment, print out yearbook superlatives (like Most Likely to Achieve and Class Clown) in bright colors and glue them onto sticks for guests to pose with in their pictures."

Prop up the collage on the table for guests to enjoy. Besides yearbook pictures, you can use any photos you like of the grad playing sports, hanging out with friends, smiling with family, or studying. Fun photos will add a bit more personality to the table, which would otherwise be just awards and a diploma."

Decorate it with paper, ribbons, and other decorations in your color scheme, then tack up a few pictures, pins, or paper certificates. Prop it up on the table or hang it on the wall behind. You can add pictures of the grad to the bulletin board, or even use it to hang up a picture collage. Some grads receive pins from sports, classes, or national achievement organizations.

Place the basket on a nearby table, or on the same one if you have room, for guests to drop off cards or other gifts for the grad. Set the folded label in front. For a unique, creative alternative, lay open an old-fashioned suitcase and string the word \u201cCards\u201d across the top. This is especially great if the grad is planning on travelling or heading away for school!"

Go with plastic ones to save money, or choose linen for a more upscale look. Choose colors in your color scheme for the most put-together look.

Dip the top of the marshmallow in the chocolate, then place a small square of graham cracker on top and let it dry for a few minutes. Cut a Twizzler string to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) long and stick it to the top with melted chocolate, then place an M&M on top to hold it in place. When you\u2019re done, your s\u2019more pop will look like a head with a graduation cap on it!
