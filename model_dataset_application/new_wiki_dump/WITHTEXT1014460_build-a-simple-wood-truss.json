          "description":"Trusses can be built in many different shapes and sizes to accommodate the dimensions of various structures. Before you can begin plotting the exact specifications of your truss, find the overall length and height of the structure being reinforced. A truss for a gable roof on one side of your home, for example, might need to be 15 feet (4.6 m) long and 4\u20136 feet (1.2\u20131.8 m) tall. The dimensions of your structure will determine the angles formed by the truss\u2019s top and bottom beams, or \u201cchords.\u201d On a relatively shallow roof, for instance, the upper and lower chords may meet at a 30-degree angle on each side. In some cases, building codes may dictate the size requirements of a truss for a certain type of structure. Be sure to consult your local building codes before you begin drawing up plans for your truss."

Fink trusses were originally invented for the purpose of beefing up bridges, but many contractors now use them to increase the strength of interior structures. When fashioning a Fink truss, the middle of the \"W\" will be at the center line of the triangle. Similarly, the points formed by the internal joists will connect at the midpoints on either side of the center line.

They are often built onto the underside of the structure they're intended for. The internal angles in a Howe truss are repeated at regular intervals. Both sides of a standard Howe truss, for example, might consist of joists forming opposing 90 and 60-degree angles. Because of their complex configuration, Howe trusses tend to be difficult to plan and assemble, and are most often reserved very large load-bearing structures. A Howe-style design will offer maximum reinforcement for multi-level structures, as well as those built from especially heavy materials."

You can order steel gusset plates from companies that specialize in construction timber or steel-working supplies.

The criteria used by your licensing department may differ depending on factors like zoning laws, geographical features, and weather patterns. For example, if you live in an area with heavy snowfall, your city will likely have strict requirements about the bearing strength of your new structure.

Keep in mind that the angles formed by the internal joists will remain the same despite differences in the frame's height or width.

For ease of application, look for glues that come in tubes similar to caulk guns. Take your time to make sure everything is where it needs to be.
