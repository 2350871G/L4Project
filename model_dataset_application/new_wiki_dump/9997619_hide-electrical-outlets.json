If you need to temporarily use the outlet, you can always rearrange the furniture or thread the cord underneath the furniture. Choose lightweight furniture so you can easily move it toward and away from the wall. Keep the furniture at least several inches or centimeters away from the wall for easier access to the outlet."

Hang the picture over the outlet for easy access in case you need to use it while effectively hiding it. Avoid taping posters over the outlet, as these can be harder to remove if you need to use it."

          "description":"If you're using the outlet for a device, position the device directly in front of it. Roll up the cord as much as possible and set it behind the device to keep it from drawing attention to the outlet. If you have stereo speakers, for example, position them directly in front of the outlet so they hide it while you're using them."

          "description":"Hollow boxes hide your entire outlet at once, and they usually have a discreet hole in the side for cables in case you need to use it. Use a hollow box if you want to cover the entire outlet while preventing others from touching it. If you're hiding an outdoor outlet, you can also buy hollow boxes that look like rocks. You can buy hollow boxes from most hardware or home improvement stores."

Purchase a hinged cover from a hardware store or online and snap it over the outlet panel. To further hide the outlet, purchase a decorative hinged cover. Some hinged covers look like small paintings or have an artistic design."

Contact an electrician to determine which type is best for your wall and replace your old outlet with one that's easier to hide. Pop-out outlets, as the name suggests, are hidden in the wall until you press the cover to reveal the outlet. Hinged outlets have a built-in cover that, when touched, pops up and exposes the outlet. Pop-out outlets are most common for kitchen islands."

If you want to hide an outlet near an oven or stove with a metallic finish, for example, a mirrored outlet cover may be the best option.
