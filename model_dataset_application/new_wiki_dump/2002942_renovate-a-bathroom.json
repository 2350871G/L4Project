          "description":"Think about what mood, theme, and color scheme you want. This is also a good time to think about new faucets, towel rods, door knobs, tiles, and so forth. Great places to get ideas include websites such as Pinterest and home design magazines. Be sure to save pictures of bathrooms you like. Here are some other design ideas to get you started:\nGo with a theme, such as country or ocean. Write down things that might go with that theme, such as rustic wood, lavender, lighthouses, or starfish. Go with a color scheme, such as all blues or all greens. Go with a limited, modern look or an ornate, old-fashioned look."

Something as simple as changing out a light bulb or faucet probably won't be very expensive. Things such as adding a shower, or removing a wall, however, may require a higher budget. Just because something is out of your budget does not mean that you should abandon your design. You could always go for a cheaper item that looks similar or buy the item when it goes on sale. Many hardware stores also offer promotions and coupons. Prioritize your money when you budget. If you want a new vanity but flooring is more important, make that your priority when shopping."

          "description":"There are different types of renovations, and each requires a different amount of work, time, and money. Some renovations may also require the aid of a trained professional, for which you will need to hire a contractor. Simple renovations include things like painting the walls, adding faucets, or changing the towel rack and lights. This sort of work can be done by anyone, and won't take very long. Complex renovations include things like removing or adding walls, replacing bathtubs, adding a shower, or moving a toilet to another spot. These sorts of renovations require a contractor to do the work for you and may require some time to complete. If there\u2019s something you can do by yourself, start whenever you have extra time. Otherwise, you need to schedule for contractors and others to help you."

Changing a bathtub or moving a toilet also won't take much work from you, because they will be completed by a trained professional instead. Painting and adding new tiles, however, may take a lot of time and effort, especially if you choose to do the work yourself. For example, paint needs time to dry, and tiles need to be laid out in grout. This may also affect your budget. You can do most of the work yourself, but it will take a lot of time and effort. It will, however, be much cheaper than hiring someone to do it for you. You can also hire a professional instead. This may cost you more money, but you won't have to lift a finger or get dirty. Most professionals get their work completed quickly because they have done it many times before. Just because a bathroom is small does not mean that it will be finished sooner. If you need to order supplies, such as tiles, a small bathroom can take just as much time as a large bathroom. If you want your bathroom finished quickly, try giving it a cosmetic facelift instead of a full renovation."

Here are some ideas to get you started:\nConsider adding in a separate toilet room with a door; this will give you and your partner more privacy. Having both a shower stall and a bathtub will allow two people to get clean at the same time. If you choose to have two sinks, make sure that they are at least 36 inches (91.44 centimeters) apart. This will give both people enough space to spread out and not worry about bumping elbows. Be sure to include pathways. If two people are going to be using the bathroom at the same time, they will need enough space to pass by each other.

Textured paint is also a great option if you are re-painting an old surface; the texture will conceal any bumps and imperfections. Whatever paint you decide to use, make sure that it is intended for bathrooms, and is both moisture and mildew proof. Use light colors, such as sky blue, seafoam green, or lavender, if you have a small bathroom. They will make your bathroom appear bigger than it actually is.

Get a noisier one for powder rooms; the noise will give the guest more privacy, especially if the bathroom is close to a living room. Pick out some new accessories to match your new bathroom. This will include things such as towels, washcloths, and bath mats. It will also include things like soap dispensers, mirrors, and towel racks. Try buying these items when they go on sale. They can be inexpensive, but the price will add up. Renovating Your Bathroom Switch off all water valves if you are going to do anything to the sink, bathtub, shower, or toilet. You can find them behind toilets and under sinks. If you don't do this, you might end up with a flood. Cover anything that isn't getting renovated with plastic or paper to protect it. If you are painting your bathroom, you will want to cover the floors, sinks, counters, toilets, and light switches so that they don't get dirty. You can use paper, cardboard, or plastic sheeting. Be sure to tape the edges down so that the paint or dust doesn't get underneath is. If you are removing any knobs, faucets, light switches, or towel rods, be sure to put them into a box so that they stay together. This is especially important if you plan on using these items again. Shut the door when you\u2019re finished working for the day so pets or children don\u2019t get inside while the bathroom is still under renovation. Get rid of anything that you will be replacing. This includes faucets, towel rods, and toilets. The less clutter you have in your bathroom, the easier your renovation will be. You can either donate the items you won't be using anymore, sell them online, or dispose of them according to your city's requirements. Some places will ask you to leave the item outside your home so that it can be picked up and disposed of, while others will require you to take it to a facility. Start by painting your bathroom. Use a paint roller, and be sure to let each layer dry completely before adding another. Most paints will dry between two to four hours, but you might want to refer to the label on your can of paint for more specific drying times. If you don't do this, the paint may not cure properly and become sticky or bumpy. Leave the last coat of paint until after you have installed all cabinets, shelves, sinks, and tubs. Add tile or new flooring once the paint has dried. This also includes the backsplash tile behind the sink. If you are not changing the floors, then you can remove any protective coverings off the floor at this time. Install any toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers. You will most likely need to hire a plumber to do this step for you, especially if you are going to move a toilet, sink, tub, or shower from one side of the bathroom to the other. After you have installed the toilet, sink, tub, or shower, be sure to caulk around the edges so that moisture doesn't seep through. If you don't caulk, water will get into the floor and cause mildew. Install any new cabinets, shelves, cabinets, and towel rods. You can place these wherever you want in your bathroom, but keep in mind that you will need to reach these items easily. Here are some guidelines for to get you started:\nTowel rods should be placed about 4 feet (1.22 meters) above the floor. The top of a cabinet should be about 6 feet (1.83 meters) above the floor. Place the toilet paper roll holder 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) in front of the toilet. Install new lights and faucets. Be sure to properly caulk around the faucets after you install them. When buying caulk, try to get an acrylic or hybrid formula. They don't need chemicals to remove. This will make any future re-caulking easier. Clean any dust, paint, or debris. When you are done renovating your bathroom, peel off any leftover painter's tape and discard any sheets of plastic or paper. Be sure to wipe down the counters and sinks, and to vacuum or mop the floors. This will make your bathroom look better and give it that nice, finishing touch.",
