The chicken must be completely cooked though by the end of this step. Check for doneness by cutting the thickest piece open. If you see any pink, cook the chicken longer. If no traces of pink remain, you can stop cooking the chicken."

You will use some of it later on in the recipe. You may, however, wish to strain the onion and garlic from the liquid by pouring the contents of the saucepan through a colander. You only need the liquid broth, not the solid ingredients."

You could use a food processor instead of a blender, if desired. If the sauce is too thick for your liking, you can add another 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) of the reserved chicken broth or water to help thin it out.
