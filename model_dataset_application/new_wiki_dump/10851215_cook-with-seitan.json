Then, add in the seasonings that will give your steak a smoky, umami taste:\n2 tablespoons (30 mL) tomato paste\n2 tablespoons (30 mL) soy sauce\n1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) garlic powder\n1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) chili powder\n\n\u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) liquid smoke\n\n\u20444 teaspoon (1.2 mL) black pepper"

Use a rolling pin to flatten each section into steaks that are \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick. Seitan dough can be tough and quite stretchy, so it may take some time to mold it the way you want it."

Take the seitan steaks out of the steamer and place them in the container with the marinade. Marinate for a minimum of 30 minutes or a maximum of several days in the refrigerator. You can also freeze the steaks in the marinade, to defrost and grill at a later date."

Use a brush to coat the seitan steaks with any leftover marinade while on the grill to keep them moist. Brush them again immediately before serving. Seitan steaks can be served with greens and a potato. They\u2019re also tasty when sliced and incorporated into a salad."
