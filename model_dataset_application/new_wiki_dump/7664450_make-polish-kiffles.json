Each time you separate an egg, place the egg yolks in a small mixing bowl. If you do not have an egg separator, the eggs can still be separated by gently tossing the egg back and forth between the two halves of eggshell until the entire egg white is on one side. It is suggested that an egg separator be used to avoid accidentally cracking the yolk and wasting eggs that can no longer be used for the recipe. Egg separators are fairly inexpensive (To purchase an egg separator, visit amazon.com)."
