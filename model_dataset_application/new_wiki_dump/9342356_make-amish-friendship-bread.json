  "text":" Making Starter Place warm water in bowl. Be careful that the temperature is comfortable and not hot; too hot and the water will kill the yeast, too cold and it will not activate at all. Dissolve yeast in warm water, and let activate for 10 minutes. The yeast should become foamy and rise slightly. Do not worry if there are a few lumps of yeast, but break up any very large ones that haven\u2019t dissolved. Place 1 cup of flour in a separate mixing bowl.  Add 1 cup of sugar to the flour.  Mix flour and sugar.  Add 1 cup of milk.  Add the yeast once foamy.  Stir slowly. If this is done too quickly, your mixture may lump all of the dry ingredients, not adequately feeding the yeast. It should come out thin and soupy like pancake batter. Place Ziploc bag in a bowl or cup for stability while pouring starter.  Pour into a Ziploc bag and let rest for a day. This is your day one. Preparing and Feeding Starter Receive an Amish bread starter or continue with starter from previous steps.  Leave alone for day 1 and place in secure location. The ideal environment for yeast is room temperature and without much exposure to light, so do not choose somewhere in direct, constant sunlight. Your yeast may have more trouble growing normally in cold environments. Try to avoid chilly rooms to store your starter in, but also do not place in an overly heated room, as this may cook the yeast cells. Aim for the comfortable center. You may have trouble remembering which days you have or have not completed, so as a simple reminder, write either tally marks to symbolize how many times you\u2019ve helped the yeast. Or write the actual dates, showing what day you began and which you should finish on, then check off each one you complete. Mash bag thoroughly for 1-2 minutes for days 2-5. Do not mix vigorously or you may risk spilling the bag, as contents are very fluid and squeezing the bag with too much force may result in a leak. If you notice air bubbles forming, that is normal, as the yeast ferments and grows, it releases gas; simply open the bag carefully and release as much air as possible before resealing the bag, making sure it is tightly sealed. Feed your starter mixture on day 6. Gather the ingredients indicated under For Feeding Starter. You may want to place starter bag inside of a bowl, just to make sure it does not fall over and spill when you add the ingredients. Add 1 cup of flour to the Ziploc bag.  Add 1 cup of sugar to the Ziploc bag.  Add 1 cup of milk to the Ziploc bag.  Massage the ingredients lightly until they are thoroughly incorporated. Close the bag tightly, making sure no liquid can escape, or the process will be very messy. Mash bag thoroughly for 1-2 minutes for days 7-9; the same tips from day 2-5 apply here.  Making Batter Place all starter from the bag in a mixing bowl on day 10. NOTE: using a metal mixing bowl may ruin the process of the starter, and negate all of the work; it is best to use a glass or plastic mixing bowl. Add 1 cup of milk to the batter.  Add 1 cup of sugar to the bowl.  Add 1 cup of flour to the bowl.  Mix batter slowly. Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are incorporated into the batter. Try to avoid mixing too quickly, as that can result in flour pockets. Be sure to scrape the sides and bottoms of the bowl with a spatula to be sure there is not rogue flour or sugar remaining there. Place one cup of the batter in each of the 3 remaining Ziploc bags.  Set aside the bags in a container.  Add 2 cups of flour to the bowl.  Add 1/2 cup of sugar.  Add 1/2 cup of  milk.  Add 1 cup of vegetable oil.  Add 3 eggs.  Add 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  Add 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  Add 1 5.1 oz box of instant pudding. This will add a flavor to your bread, so if you want something other than vanilla, go for a different flavor of pudding mix. NOTE: using a different color of pudding will change the color of the batter and the final color of the bread, so if you change the flavor of pudding, do not be surprised if it does not look like the photos. Add 1 tsp vanilla.  Add 1/2 tsp salt.  Mix until all ingredients are incorporated. The batter will not become a dough like bread, it will be thick like cake batter. Slightly lumpy batter is normal, but do not let clumps of dry ingredients larger than a dime remain without breaking them up and mixing them in, as this can create unpleasant flour pockets in the bread. Baking Amish Friendship Bread Preheat the oven to 325 F.  Combine 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup of sugar in a small bowl.  Spray 2 bread pans with nonstick spray, coating all sides.  Coat the sides of the pans with the cinnamon and sugar mix. Try to spread it as evenly and uniformly as possible. Pour batter into pans, splitting the batter evenly between the 2 pans.  Place pans carefully in preheated oven.  Bake for 45-60 minutes. NOTE: If pans are not bread pans (say, an 8 x 8) adjust the cooking time lower accordingly.

Slice and enjoy.  Pass on or keep the remaining bags of starter. You can pass them on to friends, along with instructions, and be sure to keep 1 bag for yourself if you want to make the bread again. You can freeze the bags in order to slow the growth of the yeast, so you can have for baking this bread on a later date without having to feed it.
