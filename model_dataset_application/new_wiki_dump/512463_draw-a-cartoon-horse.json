  "text":" Rough Outline Start out your drawing by marking out a half moon shaped body. Draw lightly at first so you can erase later. Steadily draw the neck and head. Also draw this lightly. Next comes the four long legs. Horses don't stand completely straight so the legs should angle out or in slightly (depending on preference). Details To make your sketch look a little more horse like, first add the ears and then his long head and face. This can be drawn darker as it is the actual horse shape. Mark out the details of his face and then his long neck. Draw these darker as they are the actual horse details. Give him a lustrous, silky mane. You can color this in if you want to. If done, draw strong thoroughbred legs, and block-like hooves at the bottom. The horse's hooves aren't completely lined up with the horses legs, they are slightly forward. Put a saddle on him.
