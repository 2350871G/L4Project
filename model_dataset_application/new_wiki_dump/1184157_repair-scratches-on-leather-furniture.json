          "description":"You can do this with a close inspection of the furniture piece. Since different types of leather are repaired differently, it\u2019s important to begin by identifying your furniture\u2019s leather type. The three types of leather used to make furniture are: \u201cpigmented\u201d (or \u201cfinished\u201d) leather, \u201caniline\u201d leather, and \u201cbicast\u201d leather. Most leather furniture (about 85%) is made from finished leather. This leather has a durable surface that resists scratching, and does not absorb liquids. Aniline leather is made from very high-quality leather, and so aniline furniture is rare. Aniline leather does not have a surface coating, so the texture of the leather can be seen. Companies also produce semi-aniline leather, which is still made of high-quality leather, but are covered in a thin layer of coating. Bicast leather is technically a leather byproduct, although furniture made with bicast is still considered leather furniture. Bicast leather is made from inferior-quality leather, which is split into a thin layer, and then laminated to a polyurethane top layer."

If you do not have any luck with this step, proceed on to the next step. The repair procedure that the manufacturer may recommend will be directly related to the leather type."

          "description":"Leather furniture can be scratched with different levels of severity. While a minor scratch will be easy to fix, a deeper tear in the leather is more serious and will require different procedures. You can determine how seriously your furniture has been scratched with a quick visual assessment. If the scratch is minor, only the coating of the leather will have been scratched, and the underlying leather itself will be intact. Deeper scratches mean that the leather itself has been cut. You may be able to see leather fibers around the fringe of the cut. If the leather has been completely cut through, you may even be able to see the inner stuffing of the furniture. At this point, you will not be able to fully patch the scratch on your own, and you\u2019ll need to take the furniture to a professional."

After applying the oil directly to the scratch, rub it into the surrounding leather with a circular motion. Allow the oil to dry for an hour, then wipe it off with a clean cloth. If the scratch has not repaired itself after the first application of oil, try applying more oil, and let it sit for several hours. As with all steps, test this in an inconspicuous area first as oil may absorb into the leather causing it to stain/darken."

This will smooth and repair the scratch, although it may take several re-applications before the scratch becomes invisible. Test the lanolin oil on a seldom-seen section of leather, as the oil may darken the color of the material."

          "description":"Before proceeding with this step, it is critical to be aware of your leather type. This process will only work on aniline leather types, as well as on bicast leather. To heat the leather, hold a hair dryer very close to the cloth, or press a warm iron against a damp cloth laid over the scratch. If you\u2019re applying heat from a hair dryer, use your hands to massage the leather around the scratch. The heat should bring out the natural oil and dyes in the leather. If it does, the scratch may heal itself as a result. If you\u2019re using an iron and damp cloth, hold the iron on for 10 seconds. Remove it, and look at the scratch. If it seems to have disappeared, dry off the leather and prepare to use as normal. If the scratch is still there, repeat the step with the iron once more. Avoid burning the leather. If it is uncomfortably hot to the touch, let the leather cool off before you re-apply any heat."

          "description":"Find a shade of shoe polish that matches your furniture. First, apply the shoe polish to the scratches with a clean cloth or a cotton-swab applicator. Then rub the shoe polish into the leather and, with a clean cloth, rub the scratch quickly to buff it. This process will not heal the scratches, but it may help to disguise them. If the color needs to be darker, repeat with another coat. If the color does not match your furniture once you have applied it, use a damp rag to wash it off immediately. This process will be successful with more heavily pigmented leather (and also bicast leather), since shoe polish is not generally designed for use on furniture-grade leather."
