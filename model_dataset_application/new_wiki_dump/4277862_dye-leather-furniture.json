      "headline":"Prepare the leather for the dye.",
      "description":"Use leather prep that you can get from a leather furniture dye distributor. Mist a sponge or paper towels and wipe down the leather, massaging the prep on to the surface but not spraying directly on the leather because you do not want to saturate it. Prep removes the protective silicon top coat of the leather, and using too much can damage the leather. You may use other products such as acetone but these are extremely erosive and too much can actually cause a chemical burn and severely weaken the leather!"

When applying dye, be sure not to put it on too thick, thicker areas may result in a drip or thickness that will not cure totally and could later peel away if it does not bond to the leather's surface."
