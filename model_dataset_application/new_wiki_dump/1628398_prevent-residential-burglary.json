          "description":"Install motion-sensing lights by your driveway, garage, back door, and/or your front door. These lights will turn on when motion is detected, helping to deter approaching criminals. When choosing your lights, read the outside of the box to see what is involved in installing the lights. Install them per the instructions. It is recommended that you install passive infrared lights, low pressure sodium-vapor lights, or floodlights to deter criminals. You can purchase these at your local hardware store.

Saul has over 17 years of experience as a patrol officer, field training officer, traffic officer, detective, hostage negotiator, and as the traffic unit\u2019s sergeant and Public Information Officer for the MVPD. At the MVPD, in addition to commanding the Field Operations Division, Saul has also led the Communications Center (dispatch) and the Crisis Negotiation Team. He earned an MS in Emergency Services Management from the California State University, Long Beach in 2008 and a BS in Administration of Justice from the University of Phoenix in 2006. He also earned a Corporate Innovation LEAD Certificate from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business in 2018. Saul Jaeger, MS\t\t\tPolice Captain, Mountain View Police Department\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Criminals don't want to work any harder than they have to, so make it as difficult as possible for them to break into your home. For instance, just keeping your outside lights on will sometimes deter a criminal, because they don't want to be seen. Having a dog that barks can also be a deterrant, as well as having proximity alarms and visible cameras around the outside of your home."

If you do not have an alarm decal, then display a \u201cbeware of dog\u201d or community watch decal in your front yard instead. Even if you do not have a real alarm system, just the sight of stickers or signs authorizing the presence of an alarm can keep unwanted visitors away."
