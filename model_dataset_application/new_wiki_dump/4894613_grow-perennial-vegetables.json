          "description":"Globe artichokes are grown for their edible flowers and make a striking visual addition to any garden. They are available in perennial or annual varieties:\nYou can harvest from annual plants int the first year, but a perennial will not produce edible crop the first year. However, once the perennial variety does start producing, it will regrow year after year in warmer climates (zone 7 or above). Another advantage of the perennial variety is that it offers bigger crops than annuals when they do eventually flower. These types of artichokes favor a sunny spot and regular watering."

They grow easily from seed, favor a sunny spot, and grow to huge but attractive garden plants which provide an unusual vegetable dish over winter months. You\u2019ll need to blanch the stems before eating them. This is done by wrapping the plants into bundles, surrounding with straw and then piling up the earth around the plant."

If you are growing this root crop as a perennial, leave some of the root behind and it will regrow. Horseradish will grow best in zones 3 to 9 in either sun or partial shade. Grown as a perennial be prepared for it to spread \u2013 so consider planting it in a deep container if you want to restrict it. For more information on growing horseradish, see this article. The zones refer to the average annual minimum winter temperature in your area. North America is split into 11 zones, each one 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) warmer or colder than the one adjacent to it.

Generally this is frowned upon, because the tubers can carry diseases from one year to the next and the naturally-occurring spacing isn't optimal for a good crop.
