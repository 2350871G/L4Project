The marinade can burn easily, so make sure to keep your eye on it. You can pour any left over marinade into the pan when it runs out. If you are cooking beef, then cook it until it is well done and has started to caramelize. If you are cooking pork, then cut it up into thin strips before cooking. Cook it for around five minutes on each side, until it is thoroughly cooked."
