Dirt, grease, oil, or paint markings require the use of a mild acid, a hot alkali, or a biological cleaning agent. Asphalt, epoxy, vinyl, or the slag from welding need to be cleaned by sandblasting or with other abrasives."

In some cases, abrasive cleaning may be enough to remove the rust, or it may be necessary to use both a pickling solution and abrasives. In some cases, larger abrasives such as buckshot are air-blasted onto the steel."
