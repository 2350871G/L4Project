The traditional set-up features two end supports with slots for hooks on each side of the grid to snap into. Once the end supports are attached, place the board on a flat surface, and close the sliding lever at the bottom of the grid so that there are bars to prevent the checkers from falling through. When attaching the end supports to the the grid, make sure that the notched edge of the end support is facing the grid. Some versions of Connect Four, such as the Pop Out Connect Four and Connect Four On the Run travel game, feature a round game base with slots on each side for tabs on the bottom of the grid to snap into. When you\u2019re ready to play, place the board between you and your opponent so you\u2019re each on one side of it."

Next, you must decide who will play each color. Whatever color you choose, take that pile of checkers. Your opponent takes the other pile. If you and your opponent both can\u2019t agree on who should play which color, you may want to put a checker in each color in a hat, bag, or other container that you can\u2019t see into.

You want to choose each move carefully because your opponent will have a turn after you.
