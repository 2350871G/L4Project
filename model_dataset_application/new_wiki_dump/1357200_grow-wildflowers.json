You\u2019ll need to begin by factoring in your particular region and the sun exposure of your plot. Then you can decide what colors or types you want. Many wildflower gardens combine flowers with native grasses. If you choose to add a native grass to your seeding, ensure that it\u2019s not an aggressive type that will choke out your flowers."

Once you have your number, divide that by the amount of square area one packet can cover. For rectangular plots, measure the length and width of your space and multiply the two numbers. For example, if you have a plot with a length of 15 feet (4.6 m). (4.572 m) and a width of 10 feet (3 m). (3.048 m), your calculation will be: 15 feet (4.6 m). x 10 ft. = 150 sq. ft. (13.93 sq. m)\nFor circular plots, measure half the length of the circle (the radius) and multiply that number by itself and by 3.14 (pi). For example, if you have a plot with a radius of 15 ft., your calculation will be: 15 feet (4.6 m). (4.572 m) x 15 feet (4.6 m). x 3.14 = 706.5 sq. ft. (65.55 sq. m)"

Begin rototilling 6 weeks before you want to plant, and then allow the weeds to grow. 3 weeks ahead of planting, spray the weeds with herbicide.

Use a ratio of one part seed to ten parts sand or sawdust. You can either use a seed or fertilizer spreader with an automatic crank or hand seed the plot. For larger areas, the spreader may be a better option. If you want instant wildflowers and you\u2019re not worried about your budget, you can lay down pre-sown sod of wildflowers and grasses.
