You can use a chess or checkers board if you do not have an Othello board.Tip: If you do not have an Othello board and pieces, then draw one on a piece of paper. Get a piece of 8 by 8 in (20 by 20 cm) paper or cardstock, and draw lines to create a grid of 64 spaces. Use coins in place of pieces and have each player choose heads or tails to represent them on the board."

The less experienced player should play the black pieces because black goes first and this provides an advantage. However, if you are both at the same level, then flip a coin to see who will play black. Place 4 discs in the center of the board so that 2 are black side up and 2 are white side up. Arrange the discs with the matching colors diagonal to each other. Distribute the remaining discs evenly between you and your opponent. Each player should have 30 of the remaining discs."

However, to level the playing field between an experienced and inexperienced player, start with more discs turned in the inexperienced player\u2019s favor that cannot be flipped over, such as in the corners of the board. In other words, set up the board as usual, but place 1 of the inexperienced player\u2019s discs into each corner of the board to give them a 4 point lead. These discs cannot be flipped over, so it will make for a fairer game. Do not place any additional pieces on the board beyond the ones you add to give the inexperienced player an advantage."

If the second player plays the white discs, they would place 1 of their discs at the end of a row. Your opponent should place their white disc so that a black disc is framed by 2 white discs on each side (or vice versa if you are playing white). Then, make sure your opponent flips the outflanked black disks to white. Remember that the row can be horizontal, diagonal or vertical.Tip: If desired, try placing a marker, such as a penny or chess piece, on the last disc you played to keep track of your moves. This may help make it easier for you to remember what you were working towards when it is your turn again."

The edges of the board and the corners are the most stable positions. Discs in the corners cannot be outflanked and discs along the edges are harder to outflank, so work towards getting discs in the edges and corners of the board. Avoid playing discs in the spaces immediately next to the extreme corners or next to the edge rows whenever possible, as this gives your opponent the chance to outflank you and gain the corner position."

For example, if you can place a disc in a corner, but your opponent is unable to do so, then hang onto this move and do something else with your turn instead."

Instead, make moves that only flip over 1 or 2 discs until you have played about half or more of your discs. By waiting to make big moves, your opponent will be more limited in what they can do. For example, if there is a move available to you that would allow you to flip 4 discs and a move that would allow you to flip 2 discs, take the 2 disc move."

Ensure that you are placing discs in a variety of locations around the board. Otherwise, your opponent may see an opportunity to block your other moves and you will lose the game. For example, instead of only placing discs along an open edge, place discs on the edge, on the inside of the board, and in corners when possible."

          "description":"You may set a specific time limit for each player's total moves if you want to play a fast, intense game of Othello. This means the game may end before you and your opponent run out of legal moves. Keep the clock running while each player takes their turn and pause the clock when they pass the turn to their opponent. Each player will need their own timer to stop and start for this option. You may choose a time limit that appeals to you and your opponent. For example, World championship rules typically give each player a total of 30 minutes to make all of their moves. This time is reduced after each turn until a player runs out of time or the game is over. However, you can set a time limit as low as 5 minutes per player if you prefer faster games."
