Sites like Wino on a Budget and Vino 100 post ratings and reviews on bottles under $20 and $25, respectively.

Keep an eye out for sales on wine at your local grocery store and buy your wine when it\u2019s at a lower price. Choose the wine with the largest discount over the cheapest wine. Many supermarkets display both wine that's always inexpensive and wine that's been marked down. If you are buying budget wine that you are not familiar with, it is best to aim for something you may not have a chance to try if it were full price."

They also often list reviews on bottles of wine that can help you make a more informed decision if you\u2019re inexperienced with buying wine. These warehouse clubs may also have larger quantities of wine on sale for an even cheaper price than individual bottles. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll need a membership to gain entry into most warehouse clubs. The price of membership varies from club to club, but is often worth it if you buy all of your groceries from the club instead of other stores."

Ask the supermarket or wine store if you can buy the wine by the case to receive a deeper discount, or mix and match a case of wine. Note that this method will be most successful if you tend to drink wine a lot and only if you won\u2019t get sick of drinking the same type of wine.

Avoid buying your wine based on myths that have wide traction but aren\u2019t factually accurate.

Other common myths surrounding wine include the idea that a bottle needs to be consumed within 1 day after it\u2019s been opened and the idea that screw cap wines are of a lesser quality. In reality, recorked bottles of wine can be refrigerated for up to 5 days, while many wineries simply use screw caps instead of cork to make opening bottles easier for consumers."

For example, connoisseurs will use words like \u201cbalance,\u201d \u201cblended,\u201d and \u201clength\u201d to describe the sensations involved in drinking wine. Refer to a \u201cwine glossary\u201d website like WineMag or Vinology to understand what these words mean in the specific context of drinking wine.

          "description":"A wine\u2019s regional provenance factors a lot into its quality as well as its price. It's often possible to get better deals on wine by picking a lesser-known appellation or an up-and-coming wine region. Up-and-coming wine regions include Clare Valley, Australia; Hill Country, Texas; La Mancha, Spain; Mendoza, Argentina; Douro, Portugal; Central Valley, Chile; and Sicily, Italy. Some wines can be from a well-known region but are cheaper because they have a less well-known name. For example, in Southwestern France, Bordeaux and Cotes-du-Rhone are well-known and expensive appellations, while wines from nearby Languedoc and Pic St. Loup offer a similar taste at a portion of the price. Similarly, if you like Pacific American wines, Washington's Columbia Valley outscores Napa in many wine tasting tests but it is consistently sold for less."

The 2 main styles of wine are red wine and white wine, which can each either be full-bodied or light-bodied. There are also sparkling wines, which are carbonated, and dessert wines, which are sweeter and tend to be served with desserts.
