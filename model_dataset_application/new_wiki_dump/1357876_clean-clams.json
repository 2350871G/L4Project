Saltwater is often considered to be the more effective method as it mimics the clams\u2019 natural habitat for cleaning. To soak the clams in saltwater, mix 1/3-cup salt (100 grams) with 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Soak the clams for 30 minutes. Take the clams out by hand. Make another bowl of the saltwater mixture and soak the clams again. This process should be repeated 1-2 more times. For freshwater, submerge the clams in a bowl of cool water. It is fine to use tap water. Let the clams soak for 20 minutes to an hour. The clams will purge any salt, sand, or other grit naturally during this time."
