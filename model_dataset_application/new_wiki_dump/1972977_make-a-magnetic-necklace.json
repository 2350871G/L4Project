  "text":" Acquiring the necessary items Visit a bead store or supplier stocking beads. Even some dollar stores carry magnetic beads. Ask to see the magnetic beads and select the size, shape and shade/color of beads you'd like for your necklace. Purchase necklace string. It must be strong and long enough to go around your neck. Always purchase extra string to cover errors. Purchase a clasp. Choose a clasp that is suited to the size of the beads and in a color you prefer (usually silver or gold, but can be other colors too). Assembling the necklace Place the beads on a bead board or in a dish to keep track of them. If you purchased beads of varying sizes and shapes, use the bead board to arrange a suitable design for the necklace. Bead boards often have an indented circle or oval allowing you to arrange the beads without them rolling off anywhere. Lay the string out on a flat work surface. It's a good idea to put down a non-slip surface, such as a non-slip mat or a silicone sheet. Knot one end of the necklace string. This will prevent the first bead from slipping off. Be sure to leave sufficient string end for adding the clasp. Begin threading on the magnetic beads. Follow the pattern you've chosen, if relevant.
