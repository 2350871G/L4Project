          "description":"Using your own breath or a hair dryer, blow the dust and dirt off the plexiglass. If using a hair dryer, be sure it is set to its coolest setting. Hot air will damage the plexiglass. Position the hair dryer at a 45 degree angle several inches away from the plexiglass, running the air side-to-side down the surface. Take the time to thoroughly remove the dust by air before moving on, and keep blowing if you see or feel any large particles on the plexiglass. Avoid using a microfiber cloth, because although microfiber is non abrasive, scrubbing dirt or dust with the cloth before blowing larger particles off will still scratch the glass.

Claudia & Angelo Zimmermann\t\t\tCleaning Gurus & Founders, Cleaning Studio\t\t\t\tTry using a microfiber duster to remove dust and dirt. Plexiglass is delicate and very easy to scratch, so it's important to remove any particles from the surface before you clean it. Try wiping it down with a dry suede microfiber cloth to dust the surface very gently. You can even try glass cloths since they're woven compactly so particles don't get easily trapped between the fibers."

          "description":"Mix 1 teaspoon (5 millimeters) of soap into 1 US-quart (950 ml) (0.95 liters) of water. Angle the plexiglass at 45 degrees and gently pour the solution over the plexiglass. Be sure to do this in a sink or someplace that will not be damaged by running water. You can also pour the solution into a spray bottle, and gently spray the plexiglass. Keep the plexiglass at a 45 degree angle and allow the mixture to run down the plexiglass slowly. Gently running this mixture over the plexiglass will remove the smaller particles of dust and dirt, preparing the glass for wiping."

Do not press the sander onto the plexiglass with any force; be gentle and keep the sander moving at all times. This will decrease heat buildup, which damages plexiglass. For deep scratches, begin with a 220 grit or 320 grit piece of sandpaper and move up to a 600 grit or 800 grit sandpaper later on. Always wear a mask when sanding to avoid dust inhalation."

Clamp the plexiglass in place so that it doesn\u2019t move while buffing. Use a medium cutting compound for a glossy finish or a fast cutting compound for a higher luster finish."
