Pat the potatoes dry with a clean towel and transfer them to a cutting board. The best potatoes for roasting are small, all-purpose potatoes that are both waxy and starchy. Good roasting varieties include purple, Yukon Gold, and blue potatoes. If you have purple potatoes, see How to Cook Purple Potatoes for roasting this variety."

For larger potatoes, cut the quarters into eighths. Transfer the potatoes to a large mixing bowl. Instead of cutting the potatoes into quarters, you can also cut them into lengthwise strips to make oven-roasted French fries. Alternatively, you can also cut the potatoes into wedges to make roasted potato wedges."

Season the potatoes with the salt and pepper, and toss them again to distribute the seasoning evenly. For garlicky roasted potatoes, toss the potatoes with 6 cloves of minced garlic as well. You can add any other herbs or seasonings to the potatoes you like, including a teaspoon (2 g) of dried rosemary or oregano."

The oil will protect the potato from burning, and help the skin to crisp up. The best potatoes for baking in the oven are russets, because they have a thicker skin that will become crispy when baked, and their starchy flesh will become soft and fluffy."

You can also cook the potato on a foil-lined baking sheet if you prefer. Bake the potato for 50 to 60 minutes, turning it over every 20 minutes. The potato is done when the skin is dry and a fork can easily be inserted into the tender flesh. For a baked potato with skin that\u2019s soft instead of crispy, wrap the potato in aluminum foil before baking it in the oven. Aluminum-wrapped potatoes will cook faster, and could be done in 30 to 40 minutes."
