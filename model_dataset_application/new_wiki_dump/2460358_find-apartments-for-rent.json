Because renters typically have to give a couple months\u2019 notice before leaving a rental, the building manager may know of upcoming vacancies even if they aren't being advertised yet.

Rental agents are quite familiar with the area. If you're looking for specific amenities, a particular location, or certain features, an agent can help you find them. An agent may also have a good idea of which landlords to use and which to avoid. They may even be able to get you a better deal on the rent if they have landlords they work with frequently. Be prepared to pay a fee to an agent. It would be about 15 percent of the annual rent. Don't agree to pay the agent until you\u2019ve actually signed the lease, and don't pay a fee higher than 15 percent."

          "description":"One of the most important considerations when choosing an apartment is the cost of the rental. You shouldn\u2019t spend more than 30 percent of your income on living costs (rent and utilities). For instance, if you make $30,000 a year or $2,500 per month, your total monthly living expenses shouldn\u2019t exceed $750. Ask the landlord exactly what's included in the rent. When you set aside 30 percent of your income for living expenses, make sure that will cover everything, including rent, parking, and utilities such as heat and power. Some landlords require a security or damage deposit from renters at the beginning of the rental term. Other landlords may require that you pay rent for the first and last months when you start renting. Make sure you have money set aside for this."

Parking: if you have your own car, it\u2019s important that the apartment have a parking spot available. Is there a place for visitors to park when you have friends and family over? If not, where is the closest public parking? Pool and fitness facilities: this is a higher-end amenity that comes with a larger price tag. Many apartments have such facilities, and the extra money you'll pay in rent could be offset by the gym membership you no longer need. Communal spaces: if community and neighbors are important to you, does the apartment you're looking at have any shared spaces where you can go to meet with other people who live in the building? Storage: most apartment buildings have storage units available, but not everybody will get a spot. You may need a building with an available storage locker if you have lots of furniture or belongings and not enough room in the apartment.
