          "description":"Finely chop a variety of fresh green herbs, including parsley, cilantro, dill and spinach, then add crushed barberries and walnuts and season to taste. Beat the herb mixture together with whole eggs and bake. The result is an immensely flavorful frittata that can be sliced and savored hot or cold. Make sure you bake on a low heat (around 350\u00b0F, or 176\u00b0C)) so that you don\u2019t dry out the herbs. Kookoo sabzi is a popular dish that is almost always eaten on the first day of Nowruz."

          "description":"This recipe is known as dolmeh in most countries of the Middle East. Fill tender grape leaves with small handfuls of ground beef and rice and roll them up and drop them in a pot of shallow olive oil, water, sugar and lemon juice. Cook for an additional half hour at a low temperature, then serve as an satisfying snack or side dish. Wrapping dolmeh by hand can be time-consuming, but it\u2019s guaranteed to please once it comes out of the oven. It can also be a fun way to get your other family, friends and guests involved in the cooking process. The traditional way to roll Persian dolmeh is into small squared bundles."

Chill for one hour to let the ingredients thicken and the flavors mingle. Spread maast-o khiar over warm flatbread, spoon it onto a plate of meat and rice or eat it by itself like a salad."

Use the tip of your finger to trace deep grooves into the top of the bread and brush with a thin mixture of plain yogurt and water. Sprinkle with salt and sesame seeds and bake until golden brown. Use nan-e barbari to scoop up maast-o khiar, or devour it alongside sabzi khordan, a sampling of savory vegetables, herbs, nuts and feta cheese. To save time, many Persian chefs use store bought pizza dough to make nan-e barbari."

Asheh reshteh is heavy enough to work as a filling companion to other entrees or as a meal of its own. If you\u2019re unable to find or make reshteh, linguini makes an acceptable substitute.

This is an excellent meal to fix if you\u2019re expecting a lot of guests, as you can prepare a large quantity of each of the major components at once and dish them up after everyone has arrived.

Roll the mounds into softball-sized discs and bake them to a light brown color. Koloocheh dough is not finished until the top has been decorated with a series of circles. These are representative of good fortune in the new year and are also a practical measure, allowing the dense dough to ventilate as it bakes. Add a few extra ounces of ice cold water to your koloocheh dough for a light, airy consistency similar to brioche."

This particular frozen treat (like all the most delicious Persian confections) is infused with rosewater for a hint of floral flavor. On the stop top, slowly simmer whole milk with whipped eggs, sugar, vanilla extract and ground saffron. This will produce a luscious custard that can then be finished in an ice cream maker. Garnish bastani Irani with pistachios or plucked rose petals. If you don\u2019t have an ice cream maker, you can freeze the custard for 4-5 hours, whisking intermittently to smooth and break up icy chunks."
