To test when the potatoes are done, poke them gently with a fork. They should give slightly. Toss in the capers, then add other ingredients and rewarm. Once the potatoes are done, add the capers to the same pan and let them crisp for about a minute. Now combine all the ingredients--the onions, mushrooms, and bacon--in the pan. Warm it up over low heat until it\u2019s hot. Once the dish is hot, take it off the burner and sprinkle on your fresh tarragon. Boiling with Olives and Rosemary Put your potatoes in a big saucepan, fill with water, and boil. Add enough water to cover your potatoes by 2 inches (5.1 cm) and season it with salt. Turn the burner to high and bring it to a boil, then lower the heat and let simmer until a knife can just cut the potatoes. This should take 20-25 minutes. Sizzle rosemary and oil in a skillet. While you\u2019re boiling the potatoes, combine the oil and rosemary and heat on medium until the rosemary sizzles. Lower the heat and cook for another minute or so, until you can smell the rosemary. Take it off the stove and set it aside for now. Drain the potatoes and cut them into quarters. You can use a colander to drain, or simply pour out the water while holding the potatoes back with the pan lid. Wait until the potatoes have cooled down before you begin cutting. Toss the potatoes with the rosemary and olives to serve. Combine the potatoes and the rosemary oil in the saucepan, then add the olives. Toss with a spoon and add salt and pepper to taste.
