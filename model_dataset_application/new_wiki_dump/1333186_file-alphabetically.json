          "description":"Even something as seemingly straightforward as alphabetical filing offers several options to choose from. It is important that you choose one system and use it consistently. Letter-by-letter filing considers each letter in each word in the order of appearance, ignoring any spaces between words. Word-by-word filing orders items based on the first letter of each word in succession. Unit-by-unit filing takes into account each word, abbreviation, and initial, ordering items according to these. The unit-by-unit system is generally recommended."

You can choose the dictionary format, in which all files are put in one alphabetical order, regardless of the type of file or the items it contains. You can also use the encyclopedia format, in which items are grouped by type or subject, and then each group is alphabetically arranged. If you have lots of different types of items to file (recipes, tax receipts, letters, etc. ), then it can be helpful to use the encyclopedia format. Group the items by type first, then alphabetically order the items in each group. Keep the groups separated using dividers or color coding."

For example:\nSuppose you have the following items to index and file: an article on aardvarks titled \u201cNocturnal Feeding of Aardvarks,\u201d a biography of noted aardvark expert Jane A. Doe, and a promotional brochure for a Detroit Zoo aardvark exhibit. The biography of Jane A. Doe would be indexed as \u201cDoe, Jane A.,\" since last names come first in filing. It would be filed under the letter \u201cD.\u201d\nThe article \u201cNocturnal Feeding of Aardvarks\u201d could be indexed as-is, if you choose dictionary-style grouping. It could be filed under the letter \u201cN\u201d (for \u201cNocturnal\u201d), using this grouping. Alternatively, you could index \u201cNocturnal Feeding of Aardvarks\u201d as \u201cAardvarks, Nocturnal Feeding of.\u201d This would make sense if you were using an encyclopedia-style grouping, and not just filing items related to aardvarks. The item would then be filed under \u201cA.\u201d\nThe promotional brochure could be indexed as \u201cAardvarks, exhibits (Detroit Zoo).\" This would make sense if you expect to have several materials on aardvark exhibits\u2014for example, you might have another item to be indexed as \u201cAardvarks, exhibits (Toledo Zoo).\u201d\nAlternatively, the promotional brochure could be indexed as \u201cDetroit Zoo (Aardvark Exhibit).\" This might make sense if you expect to have several items related to the Detroit Zoo, or if you want to use an encyclopedia-style grouping to file items by geographic location."

However, in cases where you have items that begin the same way, use a space or the rule \"nothing before something\" to determine the filing order. For instance, file \u201cNorth East Bank,\u201d \u201cNorth East Manufacturing\u201d and \u201cNortheast Bank,\u201d in that order. Likewise, \"Doe, Jane A.\" would be filed before \"Doe, Jane A., Dr.\" Distinguish files by more detailed information, when necessary. In rarer cases, alphabetic information is not enough to determine the order of files. In these cases, you must utilize further information to index and order items. Mark this additional information on the respective files to help you distinguish them. For instance:\nIf you had items for two different individuals named Jane A. Doe, you could order them by birthdate. File \u201cDoe, Jane A. (b. 1853)\u201d would thus come before file \u201cDoe, Jane A. (b. 1967). You could also order items according to geography when you need to make distinctions. If you have files for three different banks in three different locations, and each bank is called \u201cFirst United Bank and Trust,\u201d you could order them alphabetically in the order \u201cFirst United Bank and Trust (Georgia)\u201d, \u201cFirst United Bank and Trust (Oklahoma),\u201d and \u201cFirst United Bank and Trust (South Dakota).\u201d\nLikewise, if you had items for two different bears or types of bears, you would distinguish them further, based on species, geographic location, etc. For instance, you might have files on \u201cBear, Brown\u201d and \u201cBear, Grizzly\u201d (in that order), or files on \"Bears (European)\" and \u201cBears (North American)\u201d (in that order). Publicize exceptions and special rules. Make sure that everyone who uses your files knows about any exceptions to standard guidelines that are factored into your filing system. This will help ensure that everyone can use the filing system properly and efficiently.",
