Also, use cards that prevent your opponent from attacking, like Swords of Revealing Light, Level Limit - Area B, Gravity Bind or Ordeal of a Traveler. Hand traps like Battle Fader, Swift Scarecrow, or Speedroid Menko and cards that end the battle phase are also good. You can also decrease their monsters' ATKs with effects like Burden of the Mighty or Half Shut."
