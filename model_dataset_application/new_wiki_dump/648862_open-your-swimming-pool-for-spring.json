Remove cover quickly by fan-folding it into 3\u20135 feet (0.9\u20131.5 m) folds on one end of the pool. Take cover to open area where it can be unfolded and hosed clean. A sloping yard or driveway makes this easier. When cover is cleaned, allow to dry or use blower to hasten drying. Fan fold (accordion-style) cover to facilitate its installation in the fall. Roll tightly and wrap with rope or twine to prevent it from unrolling during storage. Place in a dry, rodent free location for its summer storage.

Restarting the Filter\\/Pump System Remove expansion plugs (Freeze Plugs) from skimmers and wall returns  Put plugs in Ziploc bag and place near cover for use. Discard any that are dry-rotted and/or cracked. Replace any wall fittings. Reassemble filter, pump, heater, etc.  Replace drain plugs into pump, filter, heater, chlorinator, etc. If above-ground pool, reattach hoses removed at closing. Replace pump and skimmer baskets, pressure gauges, pool ladders, diving boards etc.  Use thread sealant such as Teflon tape on all threaded plugs, connections. Do not over-tighten!
