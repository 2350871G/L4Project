  "text":" Carving Tri Tip Find the grain before you season and cook the steak. It\u2019s easier to determine the grain pattern when the steak is raw and unseasoned. Inspect the meat before you cook it to easily find the grain, which is the direction the fat and muscle fibers run through the meat. For a tri tip, there will be 2 different grain patterns due to the shape of the steak. The grain pattern on the smaller side of the steak will run vertically, while the grain pattern on the larger side of the steak will run diagonally. Let the steak rest for 10-15 minutes after cooking. It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t skip this step! Allowing the meat to rest ensures that the juices will be absorbed back into the steak, rather than spilling out over your cutting board. Cut the meat into 2 pieces along the seam or curved portion. Use a sharp knife and a sturdy cutting board. Your 2 pieces will be different sizes, but it\u2019s important to make the cut at the seam or curved portion so that you can carve each of the 2 pieces against the  grain. Slice the meat against the grain into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) pieces. Angle your knife slightly to cut the meat on the bias. Make sure you are cutting against the grain, which means you\u2019ll be cutting each of the 2 pieces differently due to the orientation of the grain. Cutting the meat against the grain makes it easier to chew. Grilling Tri Tip Season the steak then let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Mix 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (28.6 g) of granulated garlic, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (14.3 g) of kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon (4.7 g) of freshly ground black pepper together in a small bowl. Rub the seasoning blend all over and into the steak, then let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Don\u2019t forget to determine the grain of the meat before seasoning and cooking it! Sear each side of the steak for 10 minutes at medium-high heat. Place the tri tip on the grill over direct heat and sear it until it\u2019s nicely browned. Then, flip the steak over and sear the other side for another 10 minutes or so. Allow the steak to cook over indirect heat until it reaches 130 \u00b0F (54 \u00b0C). Transfer the steak to a part of the grill that provides indirect heat. Close the lid on the grill and allow it to cook for about 20 to 30 minutes. Use an instant-read thermometer to take the temperature of the fattest part of the steak. It\u2019s ready when the temperature reads 130 \u00b0F (54 \u00b0C). Roasting Tri Tip Marinate the steak for 6 to 12 hours in the fridge prior to cooking. Combine \u20442 cup (120 ml) of lemon juice, \u20442 cup (120 ml) of soybean oil, \u20444 cup (59 ml) of soy sauce, \u00bc cup (32 g) of white sugar, \u00bc cup (32 g) of black pepper, \u00bc cup (32 g) of garlic salt, \u00bc cup (32 g) of chopped garlic, and \u00bc cup (32 g) of chopped dried onions in large mixing bowl.
