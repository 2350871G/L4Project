  "text":" Making a Tambourine Using a nail and hammer, carefully put a hole through the center of 10 metal bottle caps.  Cut five 3-inch lengths of wire. Using or finger or pliers bend a half-inch hook at one end. Thread through two bottle caps. (Put the tops of the caps together for best sound.) Separate you embroidery hoop into 2 pieces and screw the outer piece closed.  Cut a 1-inch square out of cardboard. These are your spacers. Cut a length of tape, about 5 inches long. Laying it sticky-side up, place a spacer in the center of the type. Line the edges up carefully. Put the embroidery hoop edges against the bottom and top edges of the cardboard spacer. Wrap the tape firmly around the hoops and cardboard, securing it tightly. Reinforce the spacer with more tape. Repeat the previous steps four more times, evenly spacing the 5 spacers around the hoop.  Between the spacers, hook the bent end of a wire over one hoop. Bend the other other end around the other hoop. Secure with tap or hot glue. Repeat this 4 more times.  Finished! Now go make some music! Weaving a Basket Use the embroidery hoop as your \"loom\". This works best with a round one. Any size will do. Just remember: the larger the hoop, the larger the finished project. Cut the sleeves of an old T-shirt into half-inch to one-inch-wide loops. These will be your warps and wefts. Warp - the material you string on the hoop. Weft - the material you weave with. Stretch the loop one by one over the embroidery hoop, spacing them evenly. (These are the warps.) Use as many as needed to fill the hoop without crowding it. Smaller projects may use as few as 4, whereas larger projects may use more than 12. It is ideal that the warps be the same color. Attach the first weft by looping it over a warp and then through itself. Pull it snug, but be careful not to tear your material. Don't fret if you do. It happens. Connect another weft or two using the same method - looping them through the previous weft and through themselves.  Begin weaving the weft over and under, forming a tight spiral. Keep the material snug, but not tight. Push together two loops at the top and treat them as one warp. This creates an odd number of warps. As you go around, be sure to go under the warp that you went over last time. Continue this method until your spiral is about the size of the bottom of your basket. Continue weaving and adding wefts. Begin pulling the material tighter, making it pull on the weaving. By doing this, you make the sides pull up, little by little, into a basket shape. As you work, the sides should start to bend up. When the basket is the desired size, cut you last weft loop. Wrap it around a nearby warp and tie it firmly. Tuck the ends in. Cut the warps one at a time. Tie the ends in pairs. Trim to make a fringe or tuck in. Weaving a Mini Rug Use the embroidery hoop for your loom. If you would like a full-size rug, a hula-hoop works the best. Cut an old T-shirt into one-inch-wide loops. These will be your warps and wefts. Stretch the loop one by one over the embroidery hoop, spacing them evenly. (These are the warps)  Use as many as needed to fill the hoop without crowding it. You will probably only use 4 if you are making a mini rug. A large rug can take as many as 12. It is best if the warps are the same color. Attach the first weft by looping it over a warp and then through itself. Pull it snug, but be careful not to tear your material. Don't fret if you do - it happens.

With a hula hoop, continue until 8\" across. Begin treating each warp as 2 separate ones, dividing each individual loop. Maintain your odd number of warps by keeping one warp together. Continue weaving and adding warps. Be careful not to pull the weave any tighter as you go, or you'll end up with a basket, rather than a rug; just stay consistent. When the rug is the desired size, cut you last weft loop. Wrap it around a nearby warp and tie it firmly. Tuck the ends in. Cut the warps one at a time. Tie the ends in pairs. Trim to make a fringe or tuck into the rug. Weaving a Chair Mat Use the embroidery hoop as your \"loom\". Use a round one for best results. Any size will do. Just remember: the larger the hoop, the larger the finished project, and you want the mat to fit on the seat of your chair, so size it accordingly. You can also use a hula hoop to make an even larger mat. A hula hoop also gives you more space to work with. Cut an old T-shirt into one-inch-wide loops. These will be your warps and wefts.
