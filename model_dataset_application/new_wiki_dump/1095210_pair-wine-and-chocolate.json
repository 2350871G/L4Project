The intensity of dark chocolate can be overwhelming when combined with wine, especially if the wine is dry or bitter. If you\u2019re interested in getting the maximum health benefits out of your chocolate, dark chocolate is the way to go. It contains the highest concentrations of anti-oxidant flavanols. The percentage of cocoa in the chocolate is usually listed on the label."

          "description":"Milk chocolate usually contains a lower percentage of liquor than dark chocolate. However, the primary difference is that milk chocolate contains at least 12% milk solids, which are absent from dark chocolate. The milk powder gives milk chocolate its classic creamy taste and texture, along with a lighter color. If you crave the more bitter taste of dark chocolate along with the creamy goodness of milk chocolate, consider a \u201cdark milk chocolate,\u201d which can contain up to 42% chocolate liquor."

Your wine should be at least as sweet as the chocolate you plan to pair with it. Look for a wine that is fruity and sweet rather than bitter and dry. For example, if you\u2019re eating sweet chocolate, opt for a dessert wine like port, Madeira, or sweet sherry rather than a drier Pinot Noir.

For example, a simple, bittersweet chocolate bar might go well with a light, sparkling, fruity wine, like a Brachetto d\u2019Acqui. A rich and creamy piece of fudge or chocolate cake will pair well with a heavier, more syrupy fortified wine, like Banyuls or Maury."

Banyuls also goes well with desserts that include berries. Chocolate with caramel and sea salt pairs well with red wines that have berry, chocolate, or spicy notes.
