  "text":" Cooking in a Pot Prep the chicken. Wash the chicken in water and drain well. Leave the skin on and bones in. Mix the ingredients the day before. Ideally, your ingredients will marinate for a day before cooking. Use a large glass or stainless steel bowl and combine the soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, pepper, and tomatoes.

Move the chicken to a plate, using tongs. Reduce the sauce. Skim as much fat as possible from the liquid as it cooks and increase heat. Boil the water down by half. Brown the chicken. As the sauce reduces, grease a 12-inch (30.5 cm) saut\u00e9 pan with olive oil. Heat the pan to medium-high or 375 to 450 degrees F (190-230 degrees C). Add the chicken, skin down, to brown for up to 8 minutes. Keep the pieces skin down, but move if necessary to keep the chicken from sticking to the pan. Adjust heat so the chicken doesn\u2019t burn.
