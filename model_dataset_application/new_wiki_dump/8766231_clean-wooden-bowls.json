          "description":"Grab a soft washcloth or a soft sponge and put a few drops of mild dish soap on it. Soak the cloth or sponge with hot water and wipe the bowl down thoroughly inside and outside. In the process, don\u2019t submerge or soak the bowl in the water. Wooden bowls absorb water easily, which is why you shouldn\u2019t soak or submerge them. It\u2019s important, for the same reason, that you never put wooden bowls in the dishwasher. Don\u2019t use a scrubbing pad or steel wool unless your bowl has a tough buildup. Soft cloths and sponges are enough for basic cleaning."

It\u2019s important to get all of the soap off of the bowl so it doesn\u2019t get scummy. Try to rinse the bowl in about five seconds rather than letting it linger in the running water."

          "headline":"Dry the wooden bowl with a clean towel.",
          "description":"Wipe the entire bowl down with a clean, dry towel to remove as much of the moisture as you can. Because wood retains water easily, you will not be able to get it completely dry with a towel. Just make sure that it is only slightly damp when you finish. It may help to press the towel into the bowls more than you would when drying other materials. The pressure will draw some of the moisture out."

          "headline":"Set the bowl in a drying rack to finish drying.",
          "description":"After drying the bowl with a towel, put the bowl in a drying rack and allow it to sit until it is completely dry. You may need to let the bowl sit overnight to dry completely. Check the bowl after a few hours if you don\u2019t want to leave it overnight. Don\u2019t put a wooden bowl that is still wet into the cabinet, as this might keep it from drying completely and can ruin the bowl or cause mildew."

          "description":"Every so often, your wooden bowls can use a deeper clean than soap and water. Pour some coarse (large grain) salt into the bowl. Cut a lemon in half, and rub the juicy pulp over the surface of the bowl. Briefly wash with hot water and mild dish soap after scrubbing. Lemon juice is commonly used as a disinfectant and the salt provides a slight abrasion to the bowl\u2019s surface. A lime can be used, also, and regular table salt will have a similar effect. Scrub the outside of the bowl, too."

Dip a washcloth into the mixture and rub the entire surface of the bowls with the solution. Let the vinegar sit for five minutes, then follow the standard washing procedure afterward.

          "description":"If you have been using your bowls for years, they may develop stuck-on residue. Take fine-grit sandpaper and gently rub it with the grain of the wood. This will remove a thin layer of buildup. Sand a little bit out from the bad spot to blend it in with the rest of the bowl. You only need to sand the area that has a lot of buildup, not the entire bowl, but if the entire bowl has buildup, it\u2019s okay to lightly sand the whole thing. Remember, you only want to buff away the extra, non-wood layer that has developed. Don\u2019t apply so much pressure that you start taking off wood."

When you\u2019re looking for oil at the store, make sure it is labeled as food grade.

If you are in a hurry, try to let the oil sit for at least 30 minutes. Allowing the mineral oil to sit for a short time will still help the bowls last, but not as well as letting the oil soak in for longer."
