To assess if they\u2019re fresh, first look over the outside to see if the skin is bright and lively in color. Then, gently squeeze or press on the skin to ensure the vegetable is firm. Finally, smell the vegetables to make sure they smell as expected and don\u2019t have any odd or pungent odors. For example, when you\u2019re looking for Brussels sprouts or cabbage to freeze, choose options that are brighter green, free of blemishes, and have tighter, more compact leaves. Freezing vegetables at peak freshness will also help them maintain their texture and more flavor. For best results, freeze the vegetables within a few hours of harvesting or purchasing them to ensure you freeze them at peak freshness."

Here are a few preparation tips for commonly frozen vegetables:\nFor broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collard greens, and kale, trim off any stem ends with a sharp knife and remove course or undesirable outer leaves. For large carrots, potatoes, eggplant, pimento peppers, and turnips, peel the outer layer of skin off using a vegetable peeler or knife, or, if possible, by rubbing the skin off with your hands. For pumpkin, as well as different types of squash, cut the vegetable in half with a sharp knife, remove the stem and any undesirable innards, and cut the remaining part into chunks at your desired size."

In addition, if you plan to cook the vegetables without thawing them first, it may be helpful to have them pre-chopped. For example, if you\u2019re planning to make French fries out of frozen potatoes, you may want to chop the potatoes into long, skinny chunks so they\u2019re already in the French fry shape when you freeze them. If you want to freeze the vegetables whole, you can skip this step."

Blanch the vegetables for 3 to 5 minutes, depending on the type of vegetable. This will slow or stop the growth of the vegetable\u2019s enzymes, which can cause loss of flavor, nutrients, and freshness. For thicker and larger vegetables, such as potatoes and Brussels sprouts, blanching takes about 5 minutes. For thinner and softer vegetables, such as carrots, broccoli, and squash, blanching takes about 3 minutes. Blanching will also help preserve your vegetable\u2019s texture and color, and destroy the microorganisms on the surface of the vegetables that can cause it to deteriorate."

Make sure all of the vegetables are fully submerged for a few seconds (about 5 to 10 seconds) before removing them and drying them with a paper towel. While you want blanching to stop enzyme growth, it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t allow the vegetables to start cooking during or after blanching."
