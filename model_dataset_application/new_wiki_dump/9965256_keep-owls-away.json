          "description":"Owls typically try to avoid human contact and noises. If you see an owl lurking around your property, be as loud as you can to chase it off. Sometimes simply increasing human activity in an area, like setting up and using a fire pit and chairs in your yard, can deter an owl from trying to hunt near your home. The only type of owl known to attack people is the great horned owl, and it only does this if its nest and young are threatened. Great horned owl nests are typically only found high in trees of a forest habitat. Avoid going near a great horned owl nest, or take precautions like wearing a helmet or using an umbrella if you must walk near one."

          "description":"Owls generally don\u2019t like loud noises while they are hunting. Try tying up aluminum cans close together on a string and hanging them from your chicken coop or porch to keep an owl away. Or construct a wooden clapper by hinging together 2 pieces of wood about 2 ft (0.61 m) in length that will make a loud noise when clapped together. Use the wooden clapper manually to make a loud banging noise if you see an owl in your yard. Owls may become used to some noises, so always using the same noise can be less effective over time. Try to use various noise methods for the best results.

Roosting spikes can be purchased online and at home improvement stores, and are often called \u201cpigeon spikes\u201d because they are also used to deter pigeons from perching. These spikes can be especially helpful to place near your gutters, as owls will also sometimes use a roof ledge as their place to spy on smaller animals. Because the spikes don\u2019t harm birds, and simply prevent them from gathering in a favorite location, they are a favorite legal means of getting wild birds to move to a different location."
