  "text":" Freezing Unblanched Corn Shuck the corn to remove the husk. Use your hands to peel back the layers until the whole husk is off the ear of corn. Place the shucked ear of corn in a freezer bag. You can use a plastic container if you don\u2019t have a freezer bag, but the corn may not keep as long because of the excess air in the container. Press out excess air from the bag with your hands before you zip it shut. You want there to be as little air as possible in the bag so the corn stays fresh longer. Place the corn in a freezer for up to 2 months. When you\u2019re ready to cook the corn, remove it from the freezer bag and boil it for around 3-5 minutes. Blanching and Freezing Corn Remove the husk from the corn. Use your hands to peel off each layer of the husk, pulling off any silks on the corn as you go. Set the shucked corn aside. Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water. Use a bowl that\u2019s large enough to hold the corn you\u2019ll be blanching. You want there to be a lot of ice in the bowl; at least 2 ice trays full. Fill the bowl with cold water until the water line is about three quarters of the way up the side bowl. Don't put the corn into the ice water yet. Fill a pot halfway with water and add 2 tablespoons (14.8 mL) of sugar. Make sure the pot is large enough to hold the corn. Set the pot on a stove top. Bring the pot of water to a boil and set the ear of corn in the pot. The water may stop boiling when you set the corn in the pot. Wait a couple minutes for the water to re-boil before you start timing how long the corn's been blanching for. Let the corn blanch in the boiling water for several minutes. The exact amount of time you should blanch the corn depends on its size:\nSmall ears of corn that are 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) long should be blanched for 7 minutes. Medium-size ears of corn that are 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) long should be blanched for 9 minutes. Large ears of corn that are 8-12 inches (20-30 cm) long should be blanched for 11 minutes. Remove the corn with tongs and place it in the bowl of ice water. Let the corn completely cool in the ice water. After a few minutes, feel the corn with your hand; if it still feels warm, let it cool longer. Remove the corn from the ice water and set it on a cloth napkin. Use the napkin to slightly dry off the corn; it's OK if the corn is still a little wet after. Wrap the ear of corn in aluminum foil. Twist off the foil at the ends so the corn is tightly sealed in the foil. Put the corn in a freezer bag and press out any excess air. The less air that\u2019s in the freezer bag, the longer the corn will stay fresh. Store the corn in a freezer for 6-12 months. To eat the corn, remove it from the freezer bag and tin foil and boil it for a few minutes until it\u2019s warm enough to eat. You can also let the corn thaw and then microwave it for 3-4 minutes.",
