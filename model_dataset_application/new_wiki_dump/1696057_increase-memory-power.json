          "description":"Meditating for at least 15 to 30 minutes each day physically changes your brain, making you less anxious, and more rational and empathetic. In addition, research has shown that meditation enhances concentration and improves sleep. The four best times of day to meditate are first thing in the morning, whenever you\u2019re stressed out, on your lunch break, or at the end of your workday. Meditating right before bedtime is not recommended, as you are more likely to relax into sleep. With meditation, you want to ensure that you remain fully awake."

Research suggests that in addition to reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, yoga protects the brain from shrinking with age. Interestingly, yoga prevents shrinking mainly in the left hemisphere of the brain, which is associated with positive emotions such as joy and happiness. Along with meditating, yoga will also help you be more present \u2014 or \u201cmindful\u201d \u2014 in your everyday life."

It\u2019s also an effective stress reducer that helps improve your mood and boost your self-confidence. Studies recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity such as brisk walking, or 75 minutes each week of vigorous activity such as jogging. Choose something you enjoy \u2014 if you hate running, don\u2019t force yourself to run three times a week; swim or join an exercise class or sports club instead. Be realistic about how often you can exercise. If you know you can\u2019t do 30 minutes of walking each day, 5 days a week, break it into smaller increments of 10 minutes here and there."

          "description":"On average, adults need between 7.5 and 9 hours of sleep each night; children and teenagers need even more (between 8.5 and 18 hours, depending on their age). When we consistently sleep poorly, we are more likely to suffer from stress, anxiety, poor memory, and many other undesirable conditions. If you are meditating daily, doing yoga, and exercising regularly, you should find it less difficult to sleep at night. Give yourself at least 30 minutes at the end of the day to wind down before sleeping. Lie in bed and spend 20 minutes on progressive muscle relaxation, or read a book. Avoid looking at screens (computer, TV, phone, tablet) before bed. When you sleep, your brain consolidates information into your long-term memory bank. When you aren\u2019t getting enough sleep, it affects your brain\u2019s ability to do this, and your memory suffers."

Choosing specific places for everything and then consistently putting them away will help reduce the stress in your life, and will keep your mind free to focus on other things (like increasing your memory!). You don\u2019t have to do everything at once. Start with small things like keeping your keys in a tray or hook by the door, or making a commitment to always putting away your coat, shoes, and bag the moment you get home.
