Remember that you can choose different shades of your complimentary colors. Orange and blue is the most common complementary color pairing. Red and green are opposites on the color wheel.

Cool neutrals are in the grey family with undertones of blue and green. Neutrals can include natural fiber pillows, like jute, and navy blue."

The rug under the coffee table has a deep color of plum that you've always wanted to bring out. Choose pillows in shades of that same plum to give your rug its due.
