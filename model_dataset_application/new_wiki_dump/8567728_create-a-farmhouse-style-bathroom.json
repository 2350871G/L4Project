          "description":"There are a range of acceptable options for farmhouse style bathroom lighting. The most common option is a downward-curving sconce in a vintage style of silver or copper. Use bare bulbs or a simple glass covering over your bulbs. Alternately, antique hanging light fixtures might work, or light fixtures that resemble a candelabra with candle-style bulbs. Avoid fixtures that look contemporary or modern, such as stainless steel, chrome, or polished nickel."

          "headline":"Use round hanging mirrors.",
          "description":"Instead of the traditional wide, rectangular, across-the-wall mirror that you find in most modern bathrooms, choose a round hanging mirror. Alternately, use boxy mirrors with a square or rectangular shape instead of round hanging mirrors. If your existing mirror is unframed, frame each side with rustic wood for a quick fix."

          "headline":"Install a tub.",
          "description":"Tubs, not showers, are the preferred bathing technology in the farmhouse-style bathroom. A simple white tub elevated on four legs (known as a clawfoot tub) is the best option. Avoid installing a plastic shell-style tub. They are inappropriate for a farmhouse-style bathroom. If you can\u2019t do without a shower, choose one with simple subway tile or vintage wood-plank-style tile. Choose a stationary glass shower door with a dark frame, such as one made from wood or bronzed metal, instead of a shower curtain."

          "headline":"Add some foliage.",
          "description":"A small glass vase of lilacs will look great on a shelf in your farmhouse-style bathroom. Alternately, place a tin or copper bucket with wild flowers or ferns on your counter. Opt for silk or fake flowers instead of real ones, as they will last longer. You might also like white flowers like daisies to match your white d\u00e9cor. Avoid bold colors like bright red or orange. Stick to a single color or species when selecting foliage for your farmhouse style bathroom."

          "description":"Imagery will help emphasize your bathroom\u2019s farmhouse theme. Pictures of farm animals like chickens, cows, or horses are good options, as are scenes depicting crops and fields. Choose art that evokes farm life to put the finishing touch on your farmhouse style bathroom. You might also choose to incorporate antique signs that gesture toward small-town life of a previous era. Metal signs with words like \u201cSoap\u201d or \u201cWash Up\u201d on them would look great in a farmhouse-style bathroom."

For instance, you might have light flooring of wood or tile, a green plant or two, and dark wicker furniture. When placing shelves and furniture, line everything up at right angles.

However, you could also choose to frame your mirror with a rustic, unvarnished wood frame. Wooden picture frames and furniture would also look perfect in your farmhouse style bathroom. Choose wooden furniture or wooden flooring, but not both. Contrasting materials will make your farmhouse style bathroom more stylish. Traditional farmhouses made use of dark, rugged wood rather than light wood colors or stains."

For instance, an antique wooden picture frame, towel ring, light fixture, or mirror will give your farmhouse style bathroom that timeworn look that makes the farmhouse style bathroom so attractive. You can get antiques at your local antique shop or flea market, or online."
