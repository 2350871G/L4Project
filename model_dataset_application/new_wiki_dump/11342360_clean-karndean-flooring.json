A soft sweeping brush will be gentler on the floor than a hard-bristled one. You may need to sweep more often than once a week if you have some messy spillers in the house."

Although it\u2019s possible to use other cleaning solutions, it\u2019s safest to use Karndean to avoid accidentally damaging your floor."

Simply pour a thin drizzle of Remove onto the entire surface of your floor and then wipe it up with a mop. Let the floor dry for at least 5 minutes before moving on. If you don\u2019t have the Karndean brand products, some WD-40 lubricant will do the trick. Just pour some WD-40 onto a towel and use it to scrub the scuff mark. If you have a big floor, you might need to use the whole bottle of Remove. If you have a smaller floor, you\u2019ll need less. Make sure to mop after you apply the WD-40 so that it doesn\u2019t stay on the floor."

You should use up about half a bottle, though it depends on the size of your floor. Mop the floor in one direction, and then wait 30 minutes for the floor to dry. Then pour the rest of the bottle of Karndean Refresh onto your floor and mop the floor in the other direction. Let your floor dry for 6 hours before walking on it. Mopping in both directions will make sure that the floor gets completely coated and glossy. It might be easiest to refresh your floor right before night-time, so that nobody walks on it for 6 hours."
