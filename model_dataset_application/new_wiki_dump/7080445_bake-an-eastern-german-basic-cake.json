A flavourless icing can be made by using vodka instead; after the mixture hardens (15 minutes), the alcohol will be gone, and the resulting icing will be a thick cream-white coating, providing a good surface for an additional layer of chocolate, if desired. For a chocolate coating, melt about 125 g of chocolate and spread onto the cake. For a fat-free version with the taste of chocolate, use the flavor-free product and add a heaping tablespoon of cocoa powder. It will look as if covered in chocolate, but with less calories."
