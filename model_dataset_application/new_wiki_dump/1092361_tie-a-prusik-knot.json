          "description":"The standing line needs to be about twice diameter of the loop. For example, if your loop is 6mm (about a quarter of an inch) thick, the standing line should be at least 12mm (about half an inch) thick. The standing line will support the knot and the loop will form the knot around the standing line. You can buy a standing line and a Prusik loop at a local sporting goods store or on Amazon. You can also form your own loop with a cord that is about 5ft (about 1.5m) long and 5-6mm (or .2in) thick. To join the ends, tie a double  fisherman\u2019s knot. The standing line can be a simple climbing rope. Climbing ropes come in all different lengths, depending on what you will use it for. If you wish to cover significant distance, get one that is at least 100ft (about 30m) long. For shorter distances, a 25ft (about 7.5m) rope would work well."

The long end will be looped and the short end will stay in place, so it is important to distinguish between the two."

Each time, you will wrap the long end of the loop over the standing line, then through the small end of the loop on the inside of your previous coil, then underneath the standing line over to the other side. Your wrap will get narrower each time, so make sure to start with enough space for at least three inward coils. The windings will never overlap but will coil inwardly instead. A three-wrap Prusik is standard, but a Prusik can be formed with only two wraps or up to five. If there is not a large difference between the diameter of the loop and the standing line, you will need to wrap the loop more times, up to five. But if there is a good difference in diameter between the two, the standing line being at least twice as thick, a three-wrap Prusik will suffice."

The long end will be looped and the short end will stay in place, so it is important to distinguish between the two. Tying the Knot Fold the long end on top of the standing line. At this point, you can slightly widen your oval so that there is sufficient space for the loops to move inwardly. Simply fold the long end over the standing line. The fold should be very close to the standing line, wrapping above it. Let the loop rest on top of the standing line. Make sure to keep the short end in place. Loop the long end beneath the standing line inside of the loop\u2019s short end. Take the long end and place it inside of the short end of the loop. Pull the long end underneath the standing line over to the opposite side. This is the first coil of your knot. The coil should have formed inwardly towards the center, as this knot is made from the outside in. Keep the short end in place. It will never move; only the long end will wrap.
