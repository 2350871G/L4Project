          "description":"Ombre painting simply means painting in a gradient, employing different shades of the same color to create the effect of fading. Before painting your dresser, decide if you want to create an ombre effect from top to bottom or from left to right. If your dresser has drawers stacked vertically, you can paint each drawer face a different color. This will make top-to-bottom ombre much easier."
        },

          "headline":"Choose the direction and severity of your gradient.",
          "description":"When painting, decide whether you\u2019d like to start with a lighter color and gradually move to a darker shade, or start with dark and move to light. You can use paint swatches to play around with direction before beginning. If you choose a vertical gradient and only paint your drawer faces instead of the entire dresser, you can mix and match light to dark and dark to light as the mood strikes you by switching the drawers around."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose a background color.",
          "description":"You can either paint the entire dresser ombre, or you can choose a solid background color and paint the dresser drawers different shades. Although the choice is yours, the gradient will be cleaner if you paint different shades on drawers alone and having a single background color, such as white or gray. Although using a single background color is the most popular way to paint a dresser, you can mix paint colors to create a gradual color shift in the background, then have a more dramatic ombre effect using the drawers."

          "headline":"Purchase your paint shades.",
          "description":"Once you have decided on your preferred color and direction, purchase different shades of a single color of paint to correspond to your dresser. If you have five drawers, purchase five colors, etc. You could also create a few different shades by purchasing your preferred color and white and mixing the two in different ratios."

Even if you are painting in your backyard, you\u2019ll want to have a piece of fabric to catch any stray paint droplets. If you opt for spray paint, you may also want to place drop cloths upright behind the dresser, or stand cardboard behind the surface."

          "description":"Most dresser drawers have at least one drawer pull, so be sure you remove all of these before you paint. Although you could paint around the pulls, you run the risk of spilling paint on them and ruining them. Removing the pulls will also help you get an even coat over the entire surface of the drawer or cabinet. This would be an excellent time to paint your drawer pulls if you\u2019d like to alter them to better match your ombre colors."

          "description":"Even if your dresser has not been stained or painted previously, sand the area you are planning to paint. Paint cannot adhere to slick, smooth surfaces, so sanding will help toughen the surface a bit to help paint stick. If the surface of the dresser has not been painted or stained, this need not be a long process. Instead of using an electric sander, run a single piece of sandpaper over the dresser\u2019s surface by hand once or twice."

Sawdust is infamous for getting caught in unwanted spaces and could easily make the paint clump as you go, resulting in an uneven finish. A damp cloth is enough to wipe everything down."

The more layers you paint, the darker your shade will be, so keep this in mind before you paint multiple coats. If you are painting the base white, you can begin there and move on to mixing colors next."

Although this will require more time to complete, you will save money on brushes and will avoid having to go back over any areas after you\u2019ve finished. This technique is particularly wise if you choose to mix white and one other color, as you could easily mix up your color shades. Make sure you wash and dry your brushes thoroughly between colors to prevent running and splotchy color."

Make sure the paint has dried completely before you sand. Using a damp cloth, wipe the sanded area down again, touching up any areas rendered uneven by the sandpaper."

There are some sealants specifically designed for furniture, if you\u2019d like, but if your dresser will not be coming into contact with young children or animals, a simple coat of polyurethane will do. Sealing will help prevent fading, scratching, and scuffing, and will help your colors last longer."
