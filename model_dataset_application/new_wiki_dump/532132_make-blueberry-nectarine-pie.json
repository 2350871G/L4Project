  "text":" Flaky Pie Dough With a pastry blender, cut chilled butter into the flour and salt until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Cut in the chilled shortening until it forms curds. Add the ice water gradually and toss to blend. (Your hands work great for this.) When the dough is sufficiently moist, pinch it - it will stick together  Lightly gather the dough into a round and chill before rolling.  After the dough has chilled for an hour, cut the ball into equal halves. Chill one half, and roll the second into a round about 10\" in diameter and 1/8\" thin. When you lay it into the pie dish, it should come up the sides and hang over the edge. Trim the excess, and chill for 1/2 hour.  The Filling While your dough is chilling before you roll it out, start your filling.  Put half of the fruit in a medium saucepan, keeping the remaining fruit close at hand.  Add the sugar, flour, and lemon zest and stir to mix. Bring the mixture to a soft boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. The fruits will release their juices and the liquid will thicken. Turn the mixture into a bowl and stir in the uncooked fruit.  Cool the filling to room temperature. Taste, and add lemon juice as needed. Spoon the cooled filling into the pie shell and dot the tip with butter.  Putting the Pie Together Roll out your second ball of dough.  Transfer it to the top of the pie, aligning the edges of the top crust with the bottom crust. Trim any ragged edges. Fold both layers of overhanging dough under to create a thick edge around the rim of the pan. Crimp the edges by pushing the thumb of one hand against the thumb and index finger of your other hand, creating scallops every 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) around the rim. Using a sharp paring knife, cut 4 - 6 slits in the top of the crust, brush egg wash over the top, and chill for 20 minutes.  Bake. Placing the pie on a jelly roll pan in the center of the oven, bake at 375\u00baF for about 40 - 50 minutes. Let the pie cool for 30 minutes before serving. ",
