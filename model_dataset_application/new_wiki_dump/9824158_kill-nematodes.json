          "description":"Before solarizing the soil in your vegetable garden, use a rake or a hoe to turn over and break up clumps in the top 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) of soil. Turning up the soil will allow the heat from the sun to penetrate deeper into the dirt. Turning up the soil will also bring many nematodes to the surface, leaving them exposed and vulnerable. Solarizing is the process of using heat from the sun to raise the temperature of soil in a garden. The sharp temperature increase will kill nematodes in the worked-through portion of the soil."

This will increase the heat of the solarized soil and consequently increase the number of nematodes killed by the sun. If the soil is dusty or dry, solarization will have little effect. Alternately, wait to solarize until the day after your garden has received some rain."

This process will work either on raised-bed gardens or on gardens in the ground. Clear plastic can be purchased at a local hardware store. Home-supply stores, gardening stores, or hardware stores may also stock large sheets of plastic."

Depending on the size of the garden plot, use your hands or a trowel to pile soil and dirt on top of the plastic edges. Cover the edges all the way around the garden plot. Sealing the edges of the plastic will keep the moisture inside of the plastic and focus the sun's heat on the soil, killing the nematodes."

It takes at least 6 weeks for the temperature in the garden to raise enough to kill all nematodes in the top 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) of soil. Since you want as much sun and heat on the solarizing garden as possible, it's best to solarize the garden during hot summer months. Periodically take a walk around the garden to ensure that the edges have not been uncovered by an animal or blown loose in the wind."

Do not re-till the soil after solarization. Re-tilling may bring up nematodes from deeper than 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm), which will not have been killed by solarization."
