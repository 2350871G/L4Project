A chair, stool, or table does not have to be wooden or colored a neutral shade. You can buy furniture in bright colors to lighten up a dim kitchen. For example, add a red table and chairs to an otherwise white kitchen. This will add a nice, bold touch of color. You can also paint furniture yourself. If you have some old white stools with peeling paint, buy some bright colored paint at a local hardware store and give the chairs a makeover."

Instead of placing your pastel coffee mug in the cupboard after your morning cup of coffee, keep it out on a mantel or shadowbox in your kitchen. Place your pastel colored plates on an open kitchen shelf instead of hiding them in a drawer. Make sure to keep breakable items out of reach of children and pets if you're putting them on display."

Using the naturally bright shades of fruit can add color to your kitchen in a practical way. To add even more color, opt for a brightly colored fruit bowl or basket to display your produce. Some fruits, like grapes and berries, need to be refrigerated. Refrain from putting those types of fruits in a fruit bowl."
