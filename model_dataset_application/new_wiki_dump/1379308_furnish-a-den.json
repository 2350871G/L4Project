A large den, on the other hand, might benefit from the coziness of dark wall paint. If you're not sure what to choose, go with a neutral color for the wall paint. Cream, light gray, or light brown are unobjectionable and work with most furniture. If the walls are already painted and you're not sure which colors they go with, get white or light-colored furniture. You can easily add color later with cushions and throws. Bright, fluorescent colors are harsh on the eye, especially reds, oranges, and yellows. Even in a bright, high-energy den, keep these to pillows and throw rugs, not entire walls and couches."

For instance, lay down one rug where couches will surround it, and another where the game table will go. Thick, plush rugs make the den more comfortable and luxurious."
