          "description":"Think about a time or memory you shared with that person that really captures who they were, what they loved, or what their best qualities were. Recount that story at the end of your eulogy to convey how incredible the deceased person was. For example, if your grandmother was known for her love of baking, tell the story of how she stayed up all night baking your favorite pie the day your dog died just to make you feel better. Avoid telling any embarrassing stories or ones that might offend someone in the audience."

          "headline":"Ask others to share their best memories if you can't think of one.",
          "description":"Talk to the friends and family members of the person who passed away to get ideas for a good story to use as your eulogy ending. As they recount their memories, jot down highlights you think you might want to use. Record your notes on a piece of paper or in the notes app on your phone. For example, say something like, \u201cWhat was your favorite memory of Grandma Jane? It could be something you two did together that you\u2019ll never forget or something she taught you. I want to help share some of her best moments in my eulogy.\u201d"

          "headline":"Include how the deceased person left their mark on you or other people.",
          "description":"To tie the memory into the eulogy, share the impact that the deceased person had on either your life or the lives of the people around them. Relate your story back to the impact that person had on the world, whether it's something sentimental, like inspiring you to be a better friend, or something more concrete, like donating to a charity. This part is a good way to wrap up your story and the eulogy itself. For example, you could say, \"When Grandma Jane made me that pie, I realized the importance of being there for the people you love. No one did that better than her, and I hope I can be half as selfless as she was and make her proud.\""
        },
        {
          "headline":"Keep your story brief and to the point.",
          "description":"The entire eulogy should take no longer than 5 minutes, so trim down your ending story to 2 minutes or less. Focus on the key details and memories that make the story so special and remove any information that's less important. For instance, in your story about Grandma Jane's pie, keep your description of how you could taste the love in every bite, but get rid of the sentence about what she was wearing (unless it was the sweater she always wore when she baked!). If you can't shorten your story, you can rewrite the rest of the eulogy to give you more time for the ending."
