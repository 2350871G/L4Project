You may notice branches or leaves extending out from the top or sides of the tree, creating an uneven shape. This means it\u2019s time to prune the tree to reshape it and encourage healthy growth. Remove brown or wilted leaves with pruning. If you notice any leaves that are dry, wilting, or have turned brown, you can remove them by pruning the tree. Dry, brown leaves may be an indication that the air is too dry or cold around the tree. The tree may also not be getting enough natural light. Do a regular pruning in the spring. Money trees maintain their shape best if they are pruned at least once in the springtime. Make it a point to prune your tree at least once in the months of March to May so it can flourish for the rest of the year. Pruning the Tree Use sharp gardening shears. Look for gardening shears at your local gardening supply store or online. The shears should be clean and sharp so you can trim the tree properly. Do not use shears that have already been used on plants that have any diseases or pests, as they can then transfer to the tree. Clean the shears with water or use a different pair of shears just for the money tree. Find two branches that form a V-shape off the trunk. Look for two branches that extend out from the trunk of the tree to form a V-shape. Place your finger above the V-shape to mark it so you know where to cut. Pruning the tree at the V-shape will ensure the tree maintains its shape and growth. Cut the trunk \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) above the V-shaped branches. Hold the gardening shears at a 45 degree angle as you cut the trunk. Make a clean cut to remove excess branches and leaves. Remove branches on the top and sides of the tree. Work your way around the tree, cutting branches off the top and sides of the tree that appear overgrown. Make sure you cut \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) above V-shaped branches on the trunk of the tree. Prune off any branches with dry or brown leaves. If you notice the tree has dead, dry, or brown leaves, trim the off by cutting them off at the stem at a 45 degree angle.

Remove a little at a time, rather than a lot of the tree at once. Maintaining the Tree Pinch and trim the tree regularly to prevent overgrowth.
