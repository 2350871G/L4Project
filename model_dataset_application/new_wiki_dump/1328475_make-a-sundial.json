This easy sundial is a great project for kids on a summer day. The tools required are very simple \u2013 you probably already have everything you need at home. The items required are crayons/markers, a paper plate, a sharpened pencil, pushpins, a ruler and a straight plastic straw. Start preparing the plate at around 11:30 a.m on a sunny, cloudless day. Write the number 12 on the very edge of the plate. Use a crayon or marker for this. Take the sharpened pencil and push it through the center of the paper plate. Remove the pencil so that you\u2019re left with a hole in the center. Use a ruler to draw a straight line. Draw it from the 12 to the hole you made in the center of the plate. This number represents 12 o\u2019clock noon. Use a compass to determine the closest celestial pole. Your straw, or gnomon, should point towards the closest celestial pole, which is parallel with the Earth's axis. That's the North Pole for those living in the Northern Hemisphere. If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, it's the South Pole. Bring the plate outside shortly before noon. Place it on the ground in an area that will get full sun exposure all day. Stick the straw through the hole in the center of the plate. Push the straw slightly so. Do this so that it slants in the direction of the closest celestial pole. Rotate the plate at exactly noon. Rotate it so that the straw\u2019s shadow is aligned with the line you drew. Since you are only measuring the hours of daylight, the plate will end up looking kind of like a clock, showing only 12 hours. Secure the plate to the ground. Poke a few pushpins through the plate so that it will stay fixed in the same place on the ground. Return to the plate one hour later. At 1:00 p.m., go back to the plate and check the position of the straw\u2019s shadow. Write the number 1 at the very edge of the plate, where you see the shadow falling. Set an alarm and go back outside at the top of every hour. Continue marking the shadow\u2019s position on the edge of the plate. You will observe that the shadow is moving in a clockwise direction. Talk to your child about the shadow. Ask them why they think the shadow is moving. Explain what is happening as the shadow moves around the dial. Repeat this process until dusk. Keep marking the plate every hour until you run out of daylight. At this point, the sundial will be complete. Check the plate the next day. Have your child return to the plate on the next sunny day and tell you the time based on the shadow\u2019s position. This simple device can be used to tell the time on any sunny day.
