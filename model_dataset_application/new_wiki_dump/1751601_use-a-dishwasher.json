If you're using glass cleaner, do not spray it directly on the dishwasher. Moisture can cause harm to electronic coils.

The filter is found on the bottom rack and can be easily pulled out. For precise instructions on removing your filter, refer to your dishwasher's instruction manual. Clean the filter in your sink. Use a sponge or the spray setting on your faucet to clean out food and debris stuck in the filter. When you're done, put the filter back in place.
