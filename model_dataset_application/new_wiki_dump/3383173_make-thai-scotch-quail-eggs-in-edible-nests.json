  "text":" Cooking the Eggs Add salt to a pot of water and bring to a boil. The water should taste slightly salty - not seawater salty. Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water. Cook for 6 minutes and 20 seconds. Remove the eggs and plunge them into cold water for a few minutes.  Gently peel the eggs by cracking the shells and using the edge of your thumb to flake off the shell. Start at the bottom, and try to get under and remove the thin membrane. Chill the peeled eggs while you work on the rest of the dish.  Preparing the Edible Nest Cook a handful of rice noodles and rinse with cold water.  Grate together carrot, green papaya and cabbage (use a julienne peeler or a fine grater). Add to the noodles.
