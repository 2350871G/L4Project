To make sure you're testing the actual color, wipe the paint down with a damp, soapy sponge, and allow it to dry completely before you try to match the color. In addition to giving you a more accurate color match, cleaning the wall will help the new paint adhere better."

          "description":"If you\u2019re trying to match paint on sheetrock or drywall, the easiest way to get a perfect match is to bring a sample with you to the paint store. Use a utility knife to score a square into the surface of the sheetrock about \u20448 in (0.32 cm) deep, then peel away the paper. Place the sample in a plastic bag or an envelope so it doesn\u2019t get smudged before you get to the paint store. Once the store has analyzed the color, dab a little of the paint onto a corner of the sample and let it dry to ensure it\u2019s a perfect match."

If you\u2019re trying to find a paint that\u2019s the same color as an object, you can bring that object in with you when you go to buy paint. The staff at the paint store will then scan the item and come up with an exact or near-exact digital match to the color of the object. If there\u2019s not an existing color that matches your object, the paint store can mix one up for you."

Visit the app store on your smartphone and choose an app that will scan your wall color and provide you with a color match.

To avoid these inconsistencies, try to test your paint sample in an area with plenty of natural light if you can, like near an open window or door. Since natural light changes throughout the day, it may help to take a color reading in the morning, afternoon, and evening. If your room doesn\u2019t have much natural light, use the room\u2019s primary light source to test the paint. Incandescent lights will make paint seem warmer, while fluorescent lights look cooler. Halogen bulbs more closely resemble daylight."

If you purchase paint based on the results you get from an app, be sure to test it somewhere where the difference won\u2019t be obvious. Let the paint dry completely before you check whether it\u2019s a match, since wet paint can look like a different color at first."

If you\u2019ll be doing a lot of color matching, it can be worth the investment. These color scanners are $65-$100 at most home stores and connect to your phone via Bluetooth."

Pictures won\u2019t give you an exact color match, but they can be helpful if you\u2019re trying to remember the general hue. If you can, try snapping pictures at different times of day, since the changes in lighting will make the paint look different.

Of course, if none of the samples are a match, you will probably be able to tell right away.

Paint a small swatch of each color onto the wall and look at them for a few days before making your final decision. In addition to changes in light throughout the day, changes in weather can also affect your paint color. Your swatches might look different on a sunny day than they do on a day when that\u2019s overcast."
