If you don't have a steaming rack, use a metal cooling rack or an upside down colander. To cook more or larger lobsters, you may have to adjust the cooking time, and you may need a larger pot, more water, and an extra tablespoon of salt. You'll need enough fresh water to fill the bottom of the pot, so the size and shape of the pot will determine the amount of water. To cook up to eight pounds (3.6 kg) of lobster at once, use a five-gallon (19 L) pot."

When the water boils, grab the lobster where the head meets the body. Hold the lobster down and carefully remove the rubber bands on the claws by slipping them off or cutting them with scissors. Watch your hands, or you might get pinched. You can leave the bands on during the cooking process if you're worried about getting pinched. The bands may transfer a bit of a rubbery taste to the claw meat."
