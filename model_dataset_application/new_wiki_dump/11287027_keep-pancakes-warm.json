Instead, you can use it to keep already-cooked pancakes warm. 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C) is an ideal oven temperature for keeping pancakes warm without cooking them further. If you're simultaneously prepping other breakfast foods, i.e., bacon or eggs, fry them on the stove rather than baking them in the oven. This leaves your oven free for warming pancakes."

Ideally both the oven and the rack will be warm by the time you load them up with pancakes, so perform this step before you even begin prepping the batter.
