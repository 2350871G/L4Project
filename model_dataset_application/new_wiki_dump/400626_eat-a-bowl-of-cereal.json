Be careful not to overflow the bowl, because you still need room for your milk. If you are health-conscious or unsure what a proper portion size is, check the nutrition label on the side of the box. The recommended portion size will be listed there. Once you've poured your cereal, make sure you close the bag or the box completely so that your cereal doesn't go stale. You can also place the remaining cereal into a tupperware or cereal keeper to prolong its life."

There's no need to waste this delicious and now cereal-flavored liquid. You have a few options for this. You can pick up your bowl with two hands and drink your milk.

For oatmeal, you can add things like brown sugar, nuts, fruit, or even chocolate chips. Add butter to cream of wheat or grits for a savory breakfast, or even pop an entire egg into it. Adding a dollop of peanut butter onto hot cereal is a great option, as the heat from the hot cereal will warm the peanut butter, allowing it to melt and blend well. Adding cinnamon and sugar to any of your hot cereal options can make a sweet, delicious breakfast."

If you've added yummy mix-ins and toppings, make sure to stir them throughout your hot cereal so that you have some left for your final bites. Hot cereal can stick to the sides of your bowl, so make sure you scrape your spoon along the sides to get every bit."

Some are sweet and packed with sugar, while others are healthier and packed with whole grains and fiber. Not all cereals are created equally, so it's good to explore your options. Colorful, sweet cereal can almost taste like dessert for breakfast. These types of cereal include Fruit Loops, Lucky Charms, Cookie Crisps, Trix, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. While these kid-friendly cereals may certainly taste yummy, they're chock full of sugar and should be eaten in moderation. For a healthier option, look for cereals that are high in fiber and list a whole grain ingredient first. Higher protein content is a plus, because it will keep you full longer. Total, Cheerios, Life, Kix, and Raisin Bran are all great choices. Don't forget to look at hot cereals. These include oatmeal, grits, cream of wheat, rice, quinoa, and more! Most come in various breakfast flavors, but you can also select plain versions and add your own mix-ins and toppings. Granola and muesli are also healthy, filling options.

          "headline":"Select your milk.",
          "description":"Just like cereal, you have a lot of options. Between the different types of cow's milk, lactose-free milk, and nondairy milk, you will likely find something that works perfectly with your cereal of choice. Cow's milk is the standard milk that most people think of when they hear the word. The types you'll see in the normal grocery store are whole milk, 2% milk, 1% milk, and skim milk. Whole milk tastes richer and has 3.25% fat. Both 2% milk and 1% milk have had their fat reduced (to 2% and 1%, respectively). Skim milk is 0% fat, and tastes the least rich, but has the fewest calories as well. You can choose amongst cow's milk depending on your personal taste preference and diet. Lactose-free milk is perfect for anyone who gets stomach discomfort after drinking milk. Many people are lactose intolerant, and cannot break down the lactose in milk. Lactose-free milk is regular milk that has been combined with lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose. This prevents the gastrointestinal problems that arise from a lactose intolerance. Dairy-free milk is another excellent option for anyone who doesn't like the taste of cow's milk, follows a vegan diet, or simply wants something different. Almond milk is the most popular non-dairy milk, and it even comes in different flavors like vanilla and chocolate. Coconut milk, soy milk, flax milk, cashew milk, and several others are also on the market as non-dairy milk alternatives."

          "headline":"Grab some optional add-ons.",
          "description":"One way to add some flavor, texture, or health benefits to your breakfast cereal is to throw in a little something extra. Fruit, like blueberries and bananas, will add various beneficial vitamins and nutrients. Adding nuts can add a nice crunch to your cereal, as well as protein. Adding a dollop of nut butter, like peanut butter or almond butter, can add some healthy fat and protein. Cinnamon can add a big punch of flavor to your morning meal, and it has the added benefit of being virtually calorie-free."

Big mixing bowls can do the trick. If you're not particularly starving, you can use a tinier bowl, such as the ones used for side salads.
