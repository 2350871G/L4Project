          "description":"Many popular brands include unhealthy ingredients and chemicals such as corn syrup, hydrogenated vegetable oil, mono- and di-glycerides, soy protein concentrate, maltodextrin, and soy lecithin. Pure peanut butter is made of roasted peanuts and doesn't require additional ingredients. Look for brands that exclusively use roasted peanuts in the ingredients list. Brands like Skippy, Planters, and Great Value contain additional sugar and additives. Maltodextrin is a caloric sweetener made from rice, potatoes, or cornstarch and can raise blood glucose and insulin levels. Monoglycerides and diglycerides are food additives used to prevent the oil from separating out of peanut butter. This means it is natural and normal to see the oil on top of peanut butter that does not have this additive."
