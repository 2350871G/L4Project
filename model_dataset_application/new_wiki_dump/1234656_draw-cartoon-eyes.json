          "description":"It will be helpful to draw a perfect circle using a compass, if one is available to you. Set the width of your compass to a small or medium-sized circle. Place the point of your compass on the sketch paper, and gently place the pencil tip of the compass down on the paper. Pivot the pencil tip around the stationary point of the compass to draw your circle. It may be helpful to lightly hold onto both \u201clegs\u201d of the compass, as the angle can sometimes widen with the pressure of pivoting and drawing. This will help maintain the size of your circle."

          "headline":"Use a ruler to draw a cross in the middle of the circle.",
          "description":"The cross splits the circle into four quadrants, which will help you position the eyes for the cartoon. Draw the lines as close to the middle from top-to-bottom and side-to-side as you can. This will help ensure that your eyes are placed evenly and at an equal distance from each other."

It will also help you determine whether your character is male or female or maybe even an animal or monster! Drawing the shape of the head will include the chin/jawline, ears, and hairline."

The higher the eyes sit, the smaller they might have to be to account for eyebrow and forehead space. Visa versa, the lower they are set, the larger and more dramatic the eyes can be. You will likely want the eyes to be an equal distance from the vertical line of the cross as well as levelly placed on the horizontal line of the cross."

However, you can get creative with your cartoon and use other colors, such as purple, orange, or red. Depending on the size you made your pupils, you can make the iris thicker or thinner. The size of the pupil indicates the emotion of the character, i.e. if the character is scared, then his/her pupils will be larger, showing less iris."

          "description":"It is up to you how you draw these characteristics, as it will depend on whether your character is male or female. Shade in the top edge of the oval to be a thick line that tapers at either edge to demonstrate more masculine eyelashes. Draw wispy eyelashes from the top of the oval to demonstrate more feminine eyelashes. You might still want to add in the tapered shading mentioned above to give the appearance of makeup. Only add a few thick eyelashes to make the eyes and face look very rudimentary and simple. Shade in the eyebrows to a style of your liking. You can make them thick and bushy for a male or slender and arched for a female. You can also play around with the emotions of the eyebrows, making them angry, surprised, shocked, worried, et cetera."
