To make the scrub, combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid soap and 1 tablespoon (19 g) of salt in a small bowl. You can use any type of liquid soap, including dish soap, laundry detergent, hand and body soap, or shampoo. For the salt, you can use table, Himalayan, sea, kosher, coarse, or any other type of salt. As an alternative to the exfoliating salt, you can also use toothpaste, coffee grounds, or baking soda"
