  "text":" Dip Painting the Walnut Choose walnuts. Find unblemished, clean and large walnuts. In addition, choose ones that can sit upright easily without topping. The walnut needs to be a stable place marker, so it will have to stand upright without support of any kind. Choose a craft paint in a color of choice. The color is best matched to the table setting theme, such as oranges and reds for Thanksgiving or greens and blues for a woodland setting. Paint half of the walnut. This will help to make the walnut appear \"dipped\" into a color, while leaving the lovely natural walnut color and texture on top. Paint half of the walnut, finishing at at an angle, to help make it look \"dipped\" into the color. Imperfection is part of its charm. Allow the paint to dry completely. Repeat for as many place card holders as you need for the event. Making the Place Cards for the Dipped Walnuts Cut cardstock or quality, strong paper into long, thin rectangles for forming the place cards. There should be enough room for writing on the person's name and some extra space for the flag-tip end. Cut the flag-tip end. At one end of the paper piece, cut a small V into the rectangle. This will make the place card appear flagged. Write or paint your guests' names on each card.  Using watercolors, paint just the V tip end of the place card, and a little toward the person's name. Avoid painting on the text; just paint near it, then stop. This paint can match the color that the walnut has been painted, or it can be a contrasting color. Keep the colors within the theme of the table setting or party. Repeat for as many place settings as you're preparing. Set the place cards aside to dry before attaching them to the color dipped walnut place holders. Putting the Walnut Place Card Holder Together Place a dot of hot glue on the bottom edge of each place card, preferably under the text. Attach the place card to the walnut, using a dob of glue. Press firmly until you're sure it has stuck on without any risk of the card sliding down. Repeat for each place card being made. Curve the place card slightly. To make the flag portion of the card curved, run your fingers along the edges. This step is optional; it is only if you should want a \"waving flag\" appearance to the place card. Set your table.
