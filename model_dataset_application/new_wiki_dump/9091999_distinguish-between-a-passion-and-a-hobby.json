          "description":"When you are driving, trying to fall asleep, or exercising, notice what you think about the most. If you find yourself constantly thinking about an activity when you aren\u2019t doing it, that may be a passion. Hobbies generally only occupy your mind when you are doing them, or on occasion otherwise. Passions stick with you all day and you\u2019re always thinking about some aspect of them. If you are always looking for garage sales and thrift shops, checking your online seller accounts, and trying to find buyers, buying and selling used goods is a passion of yours."

          "description":"Pay attention to what you do during a given day or a whole week. Notice what you do most frequently or for the longest amount of time in each session. The activities that you spend the most time on are likely to be passions rather than hobbies. For example, let\u2019s say in the course of a week you play guitar every day, shoot baskets twice, write bits of poetry four or five times and play Xbox once. Guitar and poetry are top contenders to be passions, while basketball and gaming are hobbies."

You\u2019re so engaged that time passes quickly. If you check the time a lot, it\u2019s probably a hobby. For example, a half-hour of basketball is plenty, but two hours of picking guitar strings passes like minutes because it\u2019s a passion."

If you tend to pursue a certain activity over other things that feel like work, it\u2019s because you\u2019d rather do your passion. Say you are working on a research project. Instead of reading up on the topic, you spend an hour taking the perfect picture for the presentation. Photography is your passion. If your dirty dishes pile up for a week because you spend an hour practicing drums, it\u2019s because you\u2019re passionate about playing."

You care a lot about it, so pursuing a passion is not usually a calming experience. Hobbies are enjoyable and pleasant, so you should feel pretty at peace when you\u2019re engaging in a hobby. For example, head out to your woodshop and start building something. If you are in deep concentration and feeling on edge, you\u2019re passionate about woodworking. Otherwise, you\u2019d feel relaxed."
