You may cook the polenta in advance which is recommended, or cook it on the stove top. Polenta is one of the few dishes that cooks well in a microwave and by making it the night before when you are cooking dinner makes the cooking the next day even easier. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/30\\/Make-an-Avocado%2C-Walnut-and-Fried-Polenta-Salad-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Make-an-Avocado%2C-Walnut-and-Fried-Polenta-Salad-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/30\\/Make-an-Avocado%2C-Walnut-and-Fried-Polenta-Salad-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Make-an-Avocado%2C-Walnut-and-Fried-Polenta-Salad-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
