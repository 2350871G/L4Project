If your gravy is particularly runny, let it simmer at medium heat for one hour. This will burn off excess moisture and help the sauce congeal. Be sure to keep an eye on the gravy and stir it regularly. This will keep it from getting too thick or become lumpy."

Once the fat has melted and become hot, add an equal amount of flour and quickly whisk the mixture. Gradually add the roux to the gravy, whisking the mixture as you add it. The amount of gravy you need to thicken will determine how much of each ingredient you need for the roux. As a rule of thumb, one tablespoon (15ml) of fat and flour will thicken one cup (237ml) of stock or runny gravy."

Slurry is a mixture of cornstarch and water that you can use to thicken your gravy quickly. Mix one 1 tablespoon (15ml) of cornstarch with an equal amount of cold water. Then, slowly add the slurry to your gravy while whisking the mixture, letting it boil for a few seconds to thicken. If your gravy is particularly runny, you may need to repeat this step a few times to get the thickness right."
