          "description":"Ideally, a circus theme should use brighter colors. Circuses are often bright, playful environments. When designing a circus-themed nursery, opt for bright colors. Bright pinks, reds, greens, and yellows work great for a nursery color scheme. Feel free to mix and match colors as well, as circuses make use of patterns like stripes and polka dots. For example, use red and yellow polka-dotted wallpaper. As an alternative, use subtle, neutral colors and accent the room with bright, circus-like accessories."

          "description":"Murals can be a great touch for any nursery. Instead of using a solid color or wallpaper for one wall, paint a mural or hire someone to paint one. You can paint scenes from a circus such as clowns, animals doing tricks, tightrope walkers, and more. Be sure to choose a mural that you\u2019ll want to keep for several years, as you\u2019ll have to paint over it if you want to change the look of the room. Keep furniture in mind when painting a mural. Opt to paint a mural on a wall that will not have a lot of furniture surrounding it."

          "description":"Circus themes can be somewhat chaotic. Instead of choosing a single type of pattern to dominate the room, mix and match patterns to add to the spontaneous circus atmosphere. Using patterns that are too uniform or consistent can interfere with the circus theme. For example, add a striped rug to the floor and use polka-dots for the wall paper. You can use patterns for things like furniture. Instead of a solid-colored dresser, get a dresser with vibrant patterns. You could also decide to use solid-colored furniture and paint, then add patterned accents, like lamp shades and blankets. This will keep the room from looking too busy."

For instance, put a large stuffed giraffe standing over the crib and place elephants, lions, and tigers on bookshelves and mantels. As your baby grows, they'll be old enough to play with the stuffed toys. In addition to having decorations, you will have toys for your baby in the future. You can try creating a scene with stuffed animals. For example, you can invest in a circular piece of styrofoam or wood at a craft store and hang it from the ceiling. Place a stuffed tiger through the circle so it looks like it's jumping through a hoop. Always avoid putting stuffed animals in the crib, as this is a safety hazard. There shouldn\u2019t be any items in the crib while the baby is in it."

If you don't want to purchase a circus-themed crib, simply cut out large circles and draw designs on them to look like wheels. Attach them to the bottom of the crib using glue to create the circus train effect. Alternatively, paint an existing crib with red and white stripes, or paint it to look like an animal cage."

To imitate the inside of a circus arena, hang string lights across the ceiling. You could also install vintage light boxes on the walls."
