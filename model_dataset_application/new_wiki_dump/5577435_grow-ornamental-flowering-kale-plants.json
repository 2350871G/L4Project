          "description":"In cooler climates, an area with full sun exposure, where it gets eight to ten hours of direct sunlight is fine. In areas where summer temperatures commonly exceed 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C), plant it in a spot where it will get six hours of sunlight in the morning and shade in the afternoon. Ornamental kale are annuals, so they only last one season or year. They grow best in the cooler weather of spring and fall. If the ornamental kale does not get enough sunlight, it will grow slowly and the center leaves will not develop their bright colors."

In fact, they thrive when temperatures drop to below 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C). When planted in early spring, they might survive the summer to flourish again in the fall in cooler climates or when planted in a garden that is shaded from the afternoon sunlight."

Mix the organic matter into the garden soil with a rototiller. If the organic matter is not thoroughly mixed into the garden soil it could interfere with water movement, creating pockets of wet organic matter and dry soil."

Water them in the morning so that any water that does get on the leaves will dry throughout the day. Give them 1 to 2 inches or 3 to 6 gallons (11.4 to 22.7 L) of water each time. The easiest way to measure how much water is being given with a soaker hose is to place a 1-inch deep can next to the plants. When the can is full, the plants have received about 1 inch of water. Too much water will cause ornamental kale leaves to turn yellow and drop. Not enough water will cause the leaves to wilt."

They also secrete a clear, sticky liquid called honeydew and can often be found on the undersides of the leaves. Be sure to spray the undersides of the leaves to get rid of any hidden aphids.
