          "description":"Avoid single-serve or individually wrapped items. Shop at stores that have bulk dispensers for grains, nuts, dried fruits, and snacks. Bring your own plastic bag or container to put the bulk food in. And try to buy bulk sizes of food or sanitary products, which saves on packaging. When buying produce at the grocery store, avoid packing the product in an extra plastic bag if it isn\u2019t necessary. Vegetables such as potatoes, onions, peppers, tomatoes, beets; and fruits such as bananas, apples, plums, and melons shouldn\u2019t require an extra bag. Instead of buying canned soup or pasta sauce, read up in a cookbook how to prepare them at home. Practice \u201cprecycling\u201d by only buying products whose materials can be recycled."

          "description":"Take durable canvas or synthetic-fiber bags, a backpack, or a basket with you to the store, enough to hold whatever you plan on buying. These can usually be bought at the stores themselves. A heavy-duty plastic bag that you use multiple times can serve the purpose almost as well."

          "description":"Disposables contribute large amounts of waste to our environment. They include things like plastic forks, knives, plates, and cups. They also include things like diapers and razor blades. Instead of buying items that you'll throw away after using them, buy items that you can use again and again. For example:\nInstead of using disposable diapers, try cloth diapers or nappies. You will have to clean them more often, but you'll reduce waste. Get a razor with replaceable blades rather than a disposable razor. You'll still have to throw the old blades away, but you'll save the plastic handle. For picnics, serve with re-usable plastic or wooden plates, cups, and utensils instead of disposable paper or plastic ones."

Try to wash clothes by hand, and dry them outside as much as possible. And if you purchase appliances, such as dishwashers, washing machines, and dryers, choose ones that are rated with the Energy Star classification. Replace all incandescent lightbulbs with Energy-Star-rated compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs), which can save you $6 in energy costs per year. Try towel drying your hair instead of blow-drying it. If it is cold inside your residence, just put on a jacket or sweater instead of turning up the heat."

Request electronic bill instead of paper ones for all your utilities, member dues, and other periodical payments. You can choose this when signing up for an account. If you are already receiving paper bills, it is not too late to change. Access your account online or by phone, and see if you can switch to electronic bills instead."

If possible, invest in an electric or hybrid vehicle--these options are more fuel-efficient and emit less carbon into the atmosphere. Organize carpools with your neighbors or co-workers to reduce fossil fuel use. Choosing a residence as close as possible to your place of work will reduce both your commute time and energy consumption."

Not only will taking the stairs save electricity, but you'll also get some exercise in. You also won't have to wait in line. Escalators and elevators cost money to run. By taking the stairs, you may see lower prices (if you\u2019re at a shopping center) or a higher salary (if you\u2019re at an office building). There are instances where taking escalators or elevators may be necessary, such as if you have an injury, a bad knee, or need to get to the 24th floor."

You can repurpose these when you need a container to put gifts in before wrapping them, when mailing envelopes or boxes, and when you need packing materials, such as styrofoam peanuts, for a shipment.

To support these stores\u2019 operations, get in the habit of regularly clearing out your closet, garage, and basement to find items you\u2019re willing to donate. You can also hand clothing down to your siblings. If you and your wears wear a similar size, consider trading outfits with them. When donating clothes, make sure that everything is in good condition.

Instead of buying bottled water, fill up a reusable plastic bottle or glass jar from the faucet.

Buying a compact, fuel-efficient used car keeps you from contributing to this waste and the pollution it produces. These vehicles also will consume less fuel, while taking up less space on the roads and in parking lots. Look for cars from the 1990s or early 2000s that typically get 30-40 miles per gallon, such as the Geo Metro, Ford Festiva or Aspire, Honda CRX HF, Toyota Tercel or Corolla, Mazda Protege, or Dodge Colt.

They\u2019re also good for storing partially-used produce in the refrigerator, protecting fragile or potentially leaky items in a suitcase, and for general carrying around. Use a plastic shopping bag for small trashcans, instead of buying small garbage bags. Some stores sell nice reusable bags. Consider getting a few of these and keeping them in your car so that you can use them when shopping."
