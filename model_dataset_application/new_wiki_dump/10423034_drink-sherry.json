          "headline":"Pick Amontillado for a darker drink.",
          "description":"When a Fino or Manzanilla is aged for even longer, it becomes Amontillado. This lengthier aging process turns the sherry a darker color and imparts notes of peanut, hazelnut, and a salty-caramel quality."

        {
          "headline":"Try Oloroso for something a little sweeter.",
          "description":"These sherries tend to have a higher alcohol content, as well as being sweeter and more full-bodied than other types. A good Oloroso will be amber-colored, but its flavors can vary from dried fruit to leather to wood."

There are recommended temperatures for each type of sherry, but keeping it chilled to a temperature of your liking is always the best and easiest option. Fino and manzanilla are best served very cold, around 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). Amontillado, Oloroso, and Pedro Xim\u00e9nez are best slightly warmer, closer to 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F). Cream sherries can be served around 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F), or on the rocks. For ease, keep your sherries stored upright in a cool room, or take them out of the refrigerator just before serving."

          "description":"The drier, more savory tones of Fino, Manzanilla, Amontillado, and Oloroso work excellently to complement or cleanse the palate with an equally savory dish. Sip the sherry over the course of the meal to bring out the flavors of both. Fino or manzanilla are both great served with olives, nuts, and cured hams or cheeses. Amontillado and Oloroso are better served with main meals, such as fish or soups with the former and red meat with the latter."

          "headline":"Store sherry upright in a cool place for up to 8 weeks.",
          "description":"The best part of a good sherry is appreciating the different flavors it can hold, so it\u2019s best served very fresh. Try and get sherry as fresh from the source as possible, and finish it quickly once it\u2019s opened to prevent losing flavor. The type of sherry will change how quickly you should consume it after opening the bottle:\nOnce you open a bottle of fino or manzanilla, drink it within 1 week. For a bottle of Amontillado, it is best consumed within 2-3 weeks. Oloroso or Cream sherries will start to lose their flavor after 4-6 weeks. Pedro Xim\u00e9nez can be stored for up to 2 months after the bottle has been opened."
