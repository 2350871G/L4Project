          "description":"This is especially important with the baking soda or baking powder to ensure that it's evenly distributed and make sure that you don't end up with big holes in your cookies. Also, since baking powder is activated by water, you would want to wait until the last minute before mixing the wet ingredients so that the baking powder doesn't \"run out of juice\" too early on in the process. This is why recipes will generally have you mix the ingredients separately in two different bowls first."

          "description":"Adding .25 to .5 ounce (5 to 15 grams) per 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of cookie dough will increase the pH of the dough, which weakens the structure and lets the dough spread more easily while it's baking. But be careful because adding too much baking soda can increase browning, leaving a salty-chemical off flavor, and make the eggs in the mixture turn grayish-green!"

          "headline":"Use coarser sugar for thicker, chewier cookies.",
          "description":"When sugar dissolves, it acts as a tenderizer that interferes with dough structure. This increases spreading in much the same way as baking soda does as described in the previous step because finer sugar dissolves more easily than coarser sugar. So if you want your cookies to remain thick and chewy, use coarse sugar (or use fine sugar for the opposite effect). If you decide to use powdered sugar for extra crispiness, make sure it doesn't have corn starch in it, or you'll get unexpected results. Not pretty!"

          "headline":"Use shortening or corn starch to get a fluffier cookie.",
          "description":"If you want a cookie that's a bit fluffier and cake-like, use one of these two ingredients. Switching the butter out for shortening will give cookies a better texture, and make them a little healthier. You can also add 2 teaspoons of corn starch in place of 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of the flour to get fantastically fluffy cookies."
