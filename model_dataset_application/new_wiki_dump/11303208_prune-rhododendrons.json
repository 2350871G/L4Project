Cutting in the winter is the best way to ensure that your plant will have new growth after you prune it. Try not to prune during a freeze. If you cut your plant and the cut branches get frozen, the severe cold may damage or shock the plant."

This will be in late spring or early summer, or whenever you notice its flowers dying and no new ones starting to grow. You can cut flowers off your rhododendron in the middle of spring when they are at their peak to get a beautiful bouquet of flowers. This will not hurt your plant."

Some healthy rhododendrons can even be cut down to 6 inches (15 cm) above the ground, but it\u2019s recommended that you try 2 feet (0.61 m) first to see if your plant will survive.

You can make your cuts on any part of the branch, unless you are trying to avoid flowers, in which case you only need to look out for buds or flowering parts of your plant.
