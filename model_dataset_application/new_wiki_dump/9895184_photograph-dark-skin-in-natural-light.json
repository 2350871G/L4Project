Ask them to stand close to the soft light source and then turn slightly so that all of the light isn\u2019t cast down on the subject directly. This should create a dynamic photo with slight shadows and curves, illuminating the subject softly."

          "description":"Instead of taking a photo with the light coming in directly behind you, try to position the subject so that the light is coming at them from an angle. This will create much greater depth in your photo, and it will give their facial features more definition."

If your subject is standing next to a strong light source, such as a super sunny window or a bright neon light display, capture a photo of their outline. You can often get a little detail by positioning them at an angle, allowing the bright light to illuminate some of their face."

Try to find backgrounds that are a bit lighter than your subject. If you want to use a darker background, you\u2019ll need to light the background and the person separately."

          "description":"If someone has orange or red undertones in their darker skin, set them up against an orange or red that will complement them and draw them out. You can also create an exciting photo by using colors that would clash with the undertones. This doesn\u2019t mean that you should make the entire background a color that would match the undertones\u2014just a small piece of the background, so that it stands out. For example, if someone has orange undertones in their skin, have them stand beside a store that happens to have an orange-toned sign.

Use your finger to touch the point you'd like to focus on in the picture, and this will adjust the lighting so that the focus point is better lit. For example, if you're taking a picture of dark skin outdoors and are getting bad backlight, touch where the person's face is on the phone screen to make the camera focus on that spot.

So instead of getting a dark-toned silhouette against a detailed lighter background or vice versa, you get details in both the subject and background. The fill flash casts light on the subject, illuminating their details and highlighting their face. This works well if you\u2019re photographing darker skin against a background such as the sky."

By setting your focus somewhere in the middle, you\u2019ll get a much better photo with equal detail. You can sharpen specific colors in the photos in Photoshop later on, if desired.
