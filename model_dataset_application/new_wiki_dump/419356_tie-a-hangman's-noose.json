For this knot, you should know:\n\nBight: Simply a U-shaped bend, where the rope turns back on itself\n\nStanding Line: This is the extra rope at the end of your knot. For example, if you were tying the noose at the end of a roll of rope, the standing line is the part leading back to the roll."

      "headline":"Take the last two feet of rope (from the end) and make a simple S-shape.",

      "headline":"Take the standing line of the rope and pass it under all three sections of the S. Simply take the top end of the rope and bring it under everything so that the S-shape in your rope rests on top of the standing line.",

    },
    {
      "headline":"Continue wrapping the rope around the S-Shape of rope 6 more times.",
      "description":"Traditionally, a hangman's noose has seven wraps, but you can do it as many times as you want. You must, however, wrap it an odd number of times, otherwise you will not be able to finish the knot. You must have at least 2-3 inches of the end of the rope left over when done."

    {
      "headline":"Pass the end of the rope through the bottom loop of the noose.",
      "description":"The bottom loop means the loop next to the standing line of rope, leading away from your knot. Tuck the end of the rope through this bight."

    {
      "headline":"Pull on the noose and standing line to tighten.",
      "description":"This will also expand your noose hole, tightening the entire knot so that you're just left with the rope, the coils, and the noose. Once tightened, this knot is strong and difficult to undo. If the noose isn't big enough, you should start over, making a larger S-shape than before."
