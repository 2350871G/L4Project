Consider placing a low console or desk along the back of the couch to define the other half of the room if you want it to be more of a study space and less of a dining space."

For example, have 2 identical couches that face each other parallel to the long walls, and 2 identical chairs on either side. Round out the arrangement with a coffee table in between. This works best in a large, long space. Filling a small space with too much furniture can obstruct foot traffic and make the room feel claustrophobic."

To keep the room feeling cohesive, use a similar color palette for both. This way, even if you don't have any tall furniture to create a sense of separate spaces, you can still create a visual distinction. For example, you could use a zebra-striped rug on one side of the room and a rug with a black and white floral design on the other side. Alternatively, you can hang artwork to create a sense of 2 different spaces. For example, centering a large piece of artwork above the couch (rather than in the center of the wall) can create a cohesive seating area."
