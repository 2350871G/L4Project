          "headline":"Apply peppermint oil.",
          "description":"Peppermint oil is a natural deterrent. The smell is simply too intense for rodents and they will not try to go near it. It also helps to mask the scent of any tasty morsels that have been missed when cleaning. It also gives the house a lovely smell, and is not toxic, unlike many synthetic chemical treatments. You can get peppermint oil in most health food stores and even some major grocery stores. Place a drop or two on a cotton ball. Place a cotton ball under or near your garbage can to deter mice from getting into it. Place the cotton balls in areas where mice are likely to enter your house, by doorways, or heat vents, etc. Peppermint oil cotton balls need to be replaced after 5-7 days, depending upon the quantity of oil you put on it. Try growing peppermint plants near the entryways. You can use the mint in cooking, as well as it serving a deterrent purpose."

          "description":"A house cat can take care of the problem. Cats that spend time outdoors are more likely to hunt to find their own food and may track down that mouse. Just be aware, not all cats have enough energy, interest or training to hunt mice. Kittens typically have to be taught by the mother to easily become a mouser. Well-fed indoor kitties might just see the mouse as a toy, and grow quickly bored of it after scaring it half witless. Shelters and adoption agencies often do not know if a cat is a good mouse hunter, and generally do not test for this. Sometimes this information is available, but usually not. While many mousers are great pets as well, not all are. \"Barn cats\" may not be socialized well with humans, although used to hunting mice for food. Even if you do not have a cat, you can use used kitty litter to deter mice. Place tubs of used kitty litter around entrances of the house. The mice will sniff the smell of cat urine and clear off in a jiffy. If you have a large infestation, a cat may not be enough to totally get rid of it. However, once you eliminate the infestation, a cat will probably prevent reinfestation."

Use spackle or caulk to seal holes that are relatively small. If you have larger holes that can't be fixed with caulk or spackle, you will need to patch your plaster or drywall. This is a bigger job but important, as a mouse can surely fit through a bigger hole. Make sure baseboards are secured and do not have gaps, so that mice can't squeeze out from behind them. If trapped within the walls, mice may chew new holes. This is why it is important to give them a chance to leave before sealing up the exterior entry point.

Large holes will need to be repaired. Once you are sure that the interior walls are secure, seal any holes on the exterior of your building.

The most common traps catch the mouse in a box that it can get in but not out of. This is a humane way to catch mice. Once you catch them, you will need to release them at least 1 mile (1.6 km) from your home, perhaps in a heavily wooded area to give them somewhere else to go. Killing or removing rodents alone will not typically solve the problem, nor keep mice gone for long. When animals are killed or removed, more will move in to use available resources. In fact, killing or removing mice can actually result in a temporary spike in the food supply, causing remaining rodents to breed. Still, it is better to reduce the population rather than give up."
