  "text":" Cleaning with Alka Seltzer Fill the vase with some hot water. Be sure to fill it up until all the stains are submerged. Before filling, make sure all loose dirt is cleaned out. This can be done by rinsing it in cold or lukewarm water. Toss in two Alka seltzer tablets. This method is great for loosening up any old, hardened bits of residue left in hard to reach places. Rinse out the vase thoroughly. This is in order to keep the lives of your next flowers long. Alka seltzer tablets can easily cause a flower to wilt. Cleaning with Baking Soda and Vinegar Fill the vase with hot water until all stains are submerged. Keep in mind other items will be added, therefore some room should be left at the top of the vase. Pour in a tablespoon of baking soda. Be sure to recognize the size of your vase, and use more if the vase is significantly large. Pour in about five tablespoons of white vinegar. Edit the amount of vinegar according to how fizzy it is. The vase should fizz and eat away at anything left in the vase. Cleaning with Salt and Vinegar Take around 1 tablespoon of salt and add vinegar until a paste forms.  Rub the paste on the residue with a washcloth. The residue should begin to be eaten away at. Try leaving the paste on the spots for ten minutes, and then scrub with an old toothbrush or washcloth if stains are still there.  Using Heated Vinegar Boil, or at least warm an appropriate amount of heated vinegar based on the size of your vase. It should be enough to fill the vase to the top, or at least enough to submerge all stains. Pour the vinegar into the vase and let soak for around 24 hours.  Scrub the stains with warm, soapy water.  Using Crushed Eggshells Try using the method in step four in order to loosen the stains. This step is less likely to work on very hard stains, therefore loosening is very important to do beforehand. Crush eggshells into sizes small enough to fit through the neck of your vase. Crush about four with a spoon or fork in a bowl to sizes slightly smaller than an inch. Add in a bit of water. Add one or two tablespoons depending on size. Cover your hand over the opening and shake well. Check regularly to see if the stains have started to go away. Be sure to dispose of all eggshells before using the vase again. Using Vinegar and Sand Fill the vase with around 1/4 cup vinegar.  Add a couple tablespoons of sand depending on size. Keep in mind that this method doesn't work as well with large vases. Shake the vase thoroughly with your hand over the opening. Rinse well afterwards.",
