To defrost, you can just place the crab legs in the fridge for 24 hours or in a pot of cold water for 4 to 6 hours. You can also grill your legs from frozen, if you prefer. Preheat the grill to medium heat.  Lay several sheets of aluminum foil down on your counter. You\u2019ll need one sheet for each set of king crab legs. Squeeze one lemon wedge on each cluster of legs. Place the squeezed lemon next to the legs. Cut 1/4 cup of butter into small cubes. Dot the crab legs with the butter. Sprinkle the parsley and chopped garlic on the king crab legs. Season with sea salt and black pepper. Cover each crab leg cluster with another foil sheet. Fold over the sides to form a packet. Grilling and Serving Grill the packets until the crab legs are bright pink on the outside. The crab meat should be opaque. This should take about 8-12 minutes for defrosted crab or about 20 minutes if you\u2019re cooking from frozen or if the crab wasn\u2019t cooked to begin with (this is uncommon). Melt the leftover butter. You can use the stove or a microwave. Carefully take the crab legs out of the packets.  Serve with sea salt and melted butter. ",
