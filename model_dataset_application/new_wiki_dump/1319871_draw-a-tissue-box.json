      "headline":"Add extra details.",
      "description":"This step only applies if you wish to do so. Draw the flaps most on the side by drawing overlapping trapezoids. Most modern tissue boxes have an exciting pattern for decoration. Draw your own cool pattern, or use a pattern that's already on a tissue box. Add ruffles to the tissue. To do this, draw lines that emphasize the waves on the tissue. Also, draw pleats at the bottom of the tissue. Add shadow effects. Define the source of light with shadows. The shadow of an object should get darker as you get further away from the light source. Also, you can draw a shadow cast from the object to whatever surface it is place on."
