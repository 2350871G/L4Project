  "text":" Placing the First Ball Enter the puzzle room. You'll notice that the path to the left is barred by a metal gate, so head down the path on the right side. Find a the ledge that's near the wall on the right side. You can climb up through there. Once you've made your way above ground, you'll notice that there are lines on the wall, which means you can run on these walls. Run across the walls. Run towards the wall on the right side and start making your way across the walls until you get to the other side of the room and onto the second platform, where the first ball is. Place the first ball. Grab the ball and throw it down towards the floor, then follow it down and place it on the first slot. Placing the Second Ball Head towards the left side of the entrance, the one blocked by a metal gate. You'll see some wooden parts of the wall that you can climb on. Climb up those wooden parts and onto higher grounds. Make your way to the other side of the metal gate. Use the wooden parts of the walls that you just got up on and drop down on the other side of the gate. Go to the north side of the room and look to your left. You'll see more wooden parts that you can climb on, so make your way up there and grab the shadow bomb. Expose the second ball. Aim the shadow bomb at the corruption crystals that's diagonal from where the shadow bomb spawns. Throw the shadow bomb at the crystals and then shoot it with your pistol to make it explode. Now the ball you need is free. Grab another shadow bomb and jump down from the ledge. Throw the shadow bomb at the ball and start rolling it towards the metal gates. Position the shadow bomb directly behind the ball. The bomb will act as a propeller so that we can \"push\" the ball through the gate without having to touch it. Open the metal door. On the small podium in the middle of the room is a climbable part at the northern side. Climb up and step on the switch. The metal door will come down, but of course, the ball won't roll on its own. That's where the shadow bomb comes in. Aim your pistol at the shadow bomb and shoot to detonate it. The ball will be propelled beyond the gate. Go back to the other room. Climb down from the podium and start making your way back to the other side of the room via the wall that you used to get there. Place the second ball. Start rolling the ball towards the second crater once you get to the other side, and a chime will play signaling that you've solved the puzzle and are now allowed to proceed.",
