A Flush occurs when you have five cards in the same suit. These cards can have any numerical value. You have the best chance of getting this hand if you\u2019re dealt four cards of the same suit on the first deal. Hold these cards and hope for the fifth card of the \u200bsame suit. Look for a Full House. A Full House has three cards of same numerical rank and two cards of a different but matching numerical rank. If you have two pairs on the first deal, hold these and try to get a Full House. Similarly, if you have three of a kind on the first deal, hold these for an even better chance to get a Full House. For example, if you had three jacks, hold these for a chance to get another pair and make a Full House. Try to get a Straight Flush. A Straight Flush has five cards in numerical order from the same suit. This excludes a straight using of all the face cards (a Royal Flush.) If you have three or more cards in the same suit and in numerical sequence, hold them to try to get a straight flush. It\u2019s easier to get an \u201coutside\u201d card than an \u201cinside\u201d card. For example, if you had a 3, 4, and 5, of hearts, you could get a 2 or 6 of hearts.
