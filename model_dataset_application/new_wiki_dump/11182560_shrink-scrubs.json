  "text":" Washing and Drying Check the tag of your scrubs, if they have one, to see what kind of fabric they are made out of. Scrubs are generally made out of cotton, or a cotton and polyester blend. Cotton will be easier to shrink than a blend, and so may require a less hot temperature shrink. Set the washer to the highest temperature setting. There is no need to add soap. If your washing machine has a separate temperature dial for wash and rinse, make sure that both dials are set to the highest temperature. Place only the scrubs in the washer and start the washer. Washing at such a high temperature may cause colors to bleed, so washing only the scrubs will make sure nothing gets discolored. Consider adding a cup of white vinegar to the wash to preserve the color of the scrubs. Turn the scrubs inside out. This will protect the color of the scrubs from fading too much in the washing process. Remove the scrubs from the washing machine and place in the dryer.

You can repeat the process however many times it takes to shrink the scrubs, or, you can switch to trying the washing and ironing method. Washing and Ironing Wash the scrubs on the highest temperature setting of the washing machine. Remove the scrubs once they are done with the cycle. For this method, do not put the scrubs in the dryer after washing. Place the wet scrubs on the ironing board. Do this immediately after you take them out of the washing machine, so that they are still wet when you begin to iron. This will maximize shrinkage. Cover the scrubs with a pressing cloth. This is optional, but will protect the scrubs from damage during ironing. A pressing cloth will make it harder to accidentally scorch or melt your scrubs.
