Keep the mixer running while you add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil. The dough will be sticky at first, but should soon form into a ball. If the dough seems too dry, add 1 teaspoon of water at a time to moisten it until it forms a ball. If the dough seems too sticky, add 1 teaspoon of flour at a time until it holds its shape."

For more calzones, divide the dough into smaller parts. At this point you can place the dough in the refrigerator and use it at a later time, or go ahead and complete the calzone recipe."

If it seems too runny after 20 minutes, continue cooking for another 10 minutes. Add the sausage meat. Stir the meat back into the skillet. Remove the skillet from heat and prepare to fill the calzones. Assembling the Calzones Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.  Roll out the dough. Remove the plastic wrap from the tray of dough pieces. Place the first piece of dough on a floured surface and use a rolling pin to roll it into disc shape. Continue until all the dough pieces are rolled into discs. Add the filling. Spoon filling into the center of each disc of dough. The filling should take up about 1/3 of the dough; don't add so much that it spreads to the edges, as this will prevent the calzones from cooking properly. Fold and pinch the dough.
