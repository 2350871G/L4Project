These feelings are not a sign of weakness or failure, but a human reaction to what you\u2019ve just experienced. Grief is a common reaction to experiencing a disaster. Even if there was no loss of life, it is normal to feel grief after losing your home or possessions, much the way you would after losing a loved one."

As much as possible, try to avoid comparing yourself to others around you, whether they\u2019re your neighbors, friends, or even family. Do what you need to do, at the pace that feels right for you. Pick one task at a time, and focus on that instead of trying to tackle everything at once. Just because those around you don\u2019t seem stressed doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t.
