Next, secure the cheesecloth in place with a rubber band. Cheesecloth can be purchased at gourmet grocery stores, wine and cheesemaking supply depots, and online. You should be able to smell the wine vinegar when you place your face close to the cheesecloth. Otherwise, loosen the cheesecloth to allow air circulation."
