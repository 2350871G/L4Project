Where do the books go? The bookshelf. Where do you keep push-pins? In a container. Where do candy wrappers go? The trashcan. Dirty clothes don't belong on the floor, either! Put these in your laundry bin so your mom can wash them and give them back to you, and the clean versions of the dirty clothes go in your dresser!"
