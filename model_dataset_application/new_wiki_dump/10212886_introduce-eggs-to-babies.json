It\u2019s fine to give your baby the whole egg; there\u2019s no need to separate the yolk from the white. There\u2019s no need to season the eggs before you give them to your baby.

If your baby is ready to eat solids from a spoon, they will take the eggs from the spoon. The first time you give your baby eggs, give them just a few bites. In addition to letting their system adjust to the new food, this will also give you time to see whether they demonstrate any symptoms of an allergic reaction, like swelling, trouble breathing, a rash, or hives."

If your baby doesn\u2019t seem to like the eggs, wait a few days and then try again. Of course, sometimes babies and small children will suddenly decide they don\u2019t like a food that they\u2019ve previously enjoyed, especially during the picky toddler years.

Feeding your baby eggs during the day will give you a chance to watch how they respond, and you\u2019ll be more likely to spot any troubling signs of an allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction include swelling of the face, lips, or eyes, sore throat, vomiting, hives, or respiratory trouble. If you notice any of these signs, stop feeding your baby eggs and call your pediatrician immediately.
