You can use super glue to fix chipped or cracked glass or plastic. Repair torn soles on shoes with super glue. Use super glue instead of duct tape to hold 2 things together."

To make the super glue more effective on smooth surfaces such as plastic or laminated surfaces, take some sandpaper and rub the area you plan to glue. Use gentle, circular motions to create texture for the glue to adhere to. Don\u2019t sand the surface too much or it will become too smooth to create an effective bond.Tip: If you don\u2019t have sandpaper, use steel wool to rough up the surface for better adhesion."

Give the glue a bottle a gentle squeeze until the glue starts to exit the opening to make sure there isn\u2019t any blockage that could prevent you from applying the glue properly. If there is a blockage, use a needle, tack, or the tip of a knife to clear the opening by scraping off any gunk blocking it."
