          "description":"Don\u2019t let your basil plants become so bushy that they begin to entangle with one another. This can cause shaded parts of your plants to wilt. Try to maintain the empty space between the plants to keep them healthy. If needed, prune or replant large, sprawling basil plants to keep them from suffocating any smaller plants around it. This will also help create a healthy, balanced root system underneath the plant. If you notice that your potted basil is no longer growing, this may be because your plant has outgrown its pot. Replant basil plants that have grown too big for their current pot. House starter plants in a pot that is 6\u20138 in (15\u201320 cm) wide. Transfer mature or large basil plants to pots that are approximately, 9\u201312 in (23\u201330 cm) wide."

          "description":"Examine different spots in your house or yard throughout the day to better help you determine the best place for your basil plant. If a certain window in your house receives a lot of sunlight in the morning and very little in the afternoon, then that might not be the best place. If you notice that the leaves on your basil plant look livelier during certain parts of the day than others, then this might be because it is not receiving a sufficient amount of sunlight throughout the day. Similarly, if the basil plant gets constant sunlight and the leaves wilt, consider moving the plant if it is potted, or putting up an umbrella or similar shade structure to keep the basil plant from shriveling and drying out."

          "description":"Water the plant at the beginning or end of the day, and only if the soil seems to be drying out. Use your finger to gently poke the soil around the potted basil plant. If it feels mostly dry, then give the plant enough water to moisten the soil. Disperse the water around the entire soil surface to avoid over-watering it in a single spot. The amount of water you give your basil plant largely depends on the size of the plant. Generally, only give your plant enough water to moisten the soil around the plant. Avoid directly watering the leaves of the basil plant. This can promote mold or fungal growth, and may even wilt the leaves if exposed to hot weather while still wet. Regular bouts of steady rain can easily overwater your basil plant. Consider investing in a protective cover to shield your basil plant from the rain. These can be purchased at your local nursery or hardware store, and online with major retailers."

To create the holes, use a screwdriver and twist it through the bottom of the pot to avoid cracking it, or use a power drill to slowly perforate the outlined areas on the bottom of the pot. If you need to punch holes in a pot that is already filled, enlist someone to help you lift and tip potted plant, so you can easily make the draining holes. Not having holes in the bottom of your pot, may lead your basil plant to develop mold or fungus."

Purchase a pH testing kit in the gardening section of your local department store or online with major retailers. Most testing kits will require you to mix a sample of your soil with distilled water, and then test the solution with a pH strip."

          "description":"Each product will affect the soil differently, so read the back of the packaging carefully. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask a representative at a local gardening store what product will work best for your soil. Typically, dolomite, quicklime, or wood ash will decrease the acidity of your soil. And the organic material, like pine needles, or sulfur will lessen the alkaline levels. After a large harvest of leaves, give your plant a boost by feeding it some liquid fertilizer. This will help stimulate its growth. Additionally, use an organic liquid or slow-release fertilizer to help cycle nutrients back into the depleted potting soil once a month. Follow the manufacturing instructions on the amount of fertilizer to use for your plant."

Secure the sheet to the ground with weighted objects like rocks. This will help sudden drops in temperature from damaging the leaves of your basil. For covering your basil plant long-term, invest in a more structured frost cover. These come in a variety of sizes and can be purchased at your local department store, local nursery, or online with major retailers. If your basil is in a pot outside, consider moving it inside during the winter months to protect it from the cold."

A handful of perforated leaves should not raise concern. If there are large areas of your plant that are affected, then you need to address the problem immediately. This will most likely be more common for basil that is outside, rather than inside, but you should still check periodically."

The water will drown any bugs present on the leaves. If you hose your plant off often, it will most likely deter any more bugs from bothering the plant. Pests like spider mites, aphids, and Japanese beetles can generally be deterred by rising the plant off with water."

If you notice that the surface of the soil around your potted basil is crawling with gnats, you will have to repot your plant. Gnats are common indoor pests for potted plants and have a tendency to lay eggs in moist soil, which will compromise the nutrients the plant receives."

If you are regularly eating the basil, then place the basil stems in a small vase or cup with water. This is a similar process of putting flowers in a vase. Cover the top of the basil with a plastic bag, and leave it on the counter at room temperature for 7-10 days. For long-term storage, rinse the basil leaves under cool water and allow them to dry completely. Then, place the leaves in a freezer bag, and store them in the freezer for 4-6 months. You can also use dried basil to season your food. Place your basil leaves in a food dehydrator to dry them out. Then, store the dried basil in an airtight container until you use it."
