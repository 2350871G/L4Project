      "description":"Most people find that the back or side positions are the most comfortable when lying in a hammock. Stomach sleeping or resting doesn't tend to be as comfortable but you could try it before assuming it won't work for you. Most important of all, unless you're in a taut spreader bar hammock, you should find yourself lying diagonally and not straight. This is important because it lets you lie in the hammock for hours without back discomfort, with plenty of support and space."
