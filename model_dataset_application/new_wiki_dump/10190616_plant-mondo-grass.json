In the early stages of planting, avoid areas that are completely sunny, as this will likely dry out the plant. If you're looking to show off the flowers in this plant, consider replanting every year, keeping the spikes short, and keeping it in a container or raised bed rather than planting it in those hard-to-reach areas."

          "description":"Mondo grass thrives in well-drained, moisture-retaining soil. It can take a few years for mondo grass to completely fill in, and you definitely don't want to slow down the process with poor soil. Test your soil by digging a hole that is at least 12 inches (30 cm) wide by 12 inches (30 cm) deep. Fill the hole with water and let it completely drain. Refill the hole with water, this time keeping an eye on the rate of drainage. Well-drained soil will drain at a rate of about 1 inch (2.5 cm) per hour. If the soil is not well-drained, use compost to improve your soil's drainage, or find another spot to plant the mondo grass."

Compost consists of organic matter and is designed to feed the soil. Coffee grounds, egg shells, leaves, and fruit peels are easy and accessible ingredients to use to start your own compost pile."

Mondo grass is typically transplanted, rather than grown from a seed, so don't waste time looking for a small packet of seeds. You'll be purchasing a plant that is already grown. If you're transplanting grass from one area of your yard to another, be careful to keep the roots of the plant in tact when you remove it from the ground.

Planting the tufts closer together will result in thicker, more bountiful-looking growth. Consider what you want the area to look like as you prepare the holes.

If it feels like you're cramming the tufts into the holes, remove small bunches from the tufts until they can be comfortably placed in the holes. Tamping the soil around the tufts helps remove air pockets and will ensure proper water drainage."

Be careful to not smother your mondo grass with mulch. Shredded bark is the most common type of mulch and a fine choice for your mondo grass. You can purchase it anywhere that sells gardening supplies. Ophiopogon planiscapus, more commonly known as black mondo grass, is also an option to edge the area. However, if you're planting your grass in a heavily shaded area, don't expect the dark leaf color in the black mondo grass. It will likely stay a shade of green."

You can use compost to maintain the color and health of your mondo grass throughout the spring and summer. Be careful to not add too much compost. Add no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) per spring/summer after the first year, especially if you're using manure-based compost.
