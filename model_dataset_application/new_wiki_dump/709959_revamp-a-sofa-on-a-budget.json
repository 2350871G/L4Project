If you can determine the manufacturer and/or specific style of your sofa, you may be able to find a slipcover made especially for it. It can also be helpful to take a photo on your cell phone.

If you have an oddly-shaped or vintage sofa, you may need to order a custom-made slipcover from an upholsterer or designer. Slipcovers vary widely in terms of cost.

First, if you have a large enough flat sheet, you can drape it over your entire sofa and tuck it in all over. You second option is to use an entire set of sheets to cover different parts of your couch. You may need to experiment with different sheet sizes to get the right fit. Choose a sheet with a color or print that the original sofa fabric does not show through. Opt for sheets made of durable fabric. For instance, though silk may look nice, it will slip around. Remove all of the cushions and lay your flat sheet over the base of the sofa. Tuck it in as best as you can. Take your fitted bed sheet and secure it over the cushions of your sofa.

You can purchase commercial upholstery cleaning products at most stores, however, you may already have some great products at home. You will also need a vacuum cleaner, and a steam-cleaning vacuum is optional. Baby wipes are ideal for both spot cleaning and wiping down hard surfaces. White vinegar can help to lift out stains. Laundry detergent can be mixed with warm water to make an effective cleansing solution. If you don\u2019t have laundry detergent, you can substitute a mild dish soap.
