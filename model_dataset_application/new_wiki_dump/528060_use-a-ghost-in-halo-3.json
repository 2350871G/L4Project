The boost however is useful for ramming opponents with your vehicle. If you kill them, this is called a 'Splatter' and counts as a kill towards your character."

Simply ceasing to apply pressure or move the Left Joystick is a much better alternative. However, pressing A can come in handy if you are about to make a large jump or avoid small obstacles, as it raises your vehicle's front allowing for some ground clearance beneath it."
