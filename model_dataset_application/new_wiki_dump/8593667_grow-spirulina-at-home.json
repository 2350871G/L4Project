A tank that size will supply a family of four with plenty of spirulina. You can grow spirulina in larger tanks, or even in a basin or pool outdoors (if you live in a warm climate). However, it will be easier to manage the spirulina culture indoors in a small tank."

For most home growers who will want to use only a small amount of fresh spirulina at a time, a fine cloth or mesh will work just fine. In addition, you'll need a scoop to get the spirulina out of the tank. If you want to harvest larger amounts of spirulina to dry, get a larger supply of fine cloth or mesh to make things easier."

Check with your local or favorite online health food or organic supplies store and ask for a spirulina starter kit. Spirulina starter cultures are usually as simple as a bottle containing spirulina algae in its medium (water). Buy spirulina cultures only from sources you trust. Since spirulina can absorb heavy metals and other toxins, you want to ensure that the starter supply has come from a safe source."
