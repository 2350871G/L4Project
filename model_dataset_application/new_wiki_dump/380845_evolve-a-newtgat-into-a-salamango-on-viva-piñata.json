      "description":"You will have to have 30 pinometers of water. You can make more water by using the shovel. If you don't know how much water you have, check the journal in the garden area section. Now go to Costolot's store and buy 3 watercress seeds for 13 chocolate coins each. Plant them near water. Once the Newtgat comes into your garden, it will eat some of the watercress. It won't eat them all at once, but it will come back and eat the rest later. Once it eats all 3 of the watercress it will become a resident! If you have already had a Newtgat as a resident before, you can buy another one from Gretchen Fetchem."
