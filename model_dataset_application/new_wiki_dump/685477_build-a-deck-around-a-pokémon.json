Many very powerful cards are balanced by retreat cost, weakness and extra effects of its attacks, including discarding energy, coin flips and even damaging itself. If these effects are too much for your deck to handle even with the proper techniques, you should not build a deck around it. It is also a bad idea to base a deck around weaker Pok\u00e9mon. Including a few may be a good idea, but going out of your way to support them in a deck is not."
