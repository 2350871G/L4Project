          "description":"If you have guests over to the house, you don't want them crawling over furniture to get around. There should be enough space between each piece for them to walk through. And your furniture should not block any entrances into or exits out of the room. This might sometimes mean that you have furniture set away from the wall. That's okay!"

          "headline":"Gather your furniture to facilitate conversation.",
          "description":"You should put two to four pieces together in each room so they face each other. This way, if you have guests over, they feel like you want them to talk to you! For example, arrange a couch parallel to a wall, but set away from it, so people can walk behind if necessary. Then set up two arm chairs next to each other, across from the couch."
        },

          "headline":"Use less furniture when in doubt.",
          "description":"If you're not sure if the space looks too cluttered, take out one piece of furniture. You want the space to look cozy and inviting, but not stuffed."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Mix up your textures and fabrics.",
          "description":"Try not to use just one texture or fabric in each room. Using one fabric can make the room all blend together and feel sterile. Using one material for your tables, one for your chairs, and another for throw pillows will help make the room feel cozy. For example, in your living room, you could have a wooden coffee table paired with linen-covered arm chairs and plush, silky throw pillows. You can also break up your kitchen by using different textures for your accessories, storage, and countertop. Try metal shelving, glass storage containers, and a granite or quartz countertop."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use plush or upholstered furniture.",
          "description":"There\u2019s nothing cozier than a comfy piece of furniture that you can sink into. When you\u2019re choosing furniture, choose pieces that are plush or upholstered. If your rooms are small, upholstered is best because it won\u2019t look too big for the room. You can reupholster existing furniture. You'll need to remove the old fabric and batting (the fluffy stuff that makes a chair comfy to sit on). Cut out the furniture patterns, then reattach the new fabric by stapling it on the underside of the furniture. If you really love the pieces of furniture you have, but don't want to reupholster them, you can take them to a specialist and have it done."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Scale your furniture to fit the room you\u2019re in.",
          "description":"If you have a small home, you don\u2019t want to cram your rooms with giant pieces of furniture. It will make your house look small and cramped, as opposed to cozy and inviting. Your furniture doesn\u2019t have to match to have similar scale. Use pieces that have a similar height and weight. This strategy is great for redecorating your home on a budget - look for things in resale shops or discount stores that are similar scale, and they don't have to match! A lot of scale is just using your eye to see if the furniture in the room looks proportionate. Start by placing your largest piece and work from there \u2013 don\u2019t add other pieces that look too large or too small in comparison."

          "headline":"Use distressed furniture.",
          "description":"Furniture that looks well-loved (distressed) can help make your home feel more lived in and cozy. You can achieve the distressed look by buying furniture that already looks this way, or using sandpaper to scrape off some of the paint on new furniture."

Creams, grays, pastel pinks, blues, or greens, and white are all great neutral and pastel colors you can use to make your home look more cozy. If you\u2019re worried about neutral colored furniture getting dirty easily, purchase a slip cover in matching neutral color. When it gets dirty, you can pull it off and put in the washing machine, and it will look good as new!"

You can pick two or three accent colors and work them into your room in different ways. Try warm colored accessories: reds, yellows, blues, and greens. To work with your existing furniture, look at the accessories you already have in your home and consider putting them in a different room. Group your accessories by color, and then use one or two colors in each room."

But if you\u2019re looking to create a cozy atmosphere in your house, also include softer lights. You can use a lower wattage bulb than in your other lighting, or bulbs that are soft white or yellow. Place this lighting near where you relax, but not directly over that spot. Lighting feels much cozier if it\u2019s in your peripheral vision, rather than directly in your line of sight."
