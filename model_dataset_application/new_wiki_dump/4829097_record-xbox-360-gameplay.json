Make sure the recording device supports the output cables for your Xbox 360 (for example, some newer recording devices only support HDMI, while your Xbox may not have an HDMI port). There are a lot of different devices to choose from when it comes to recording gameplay. The most popular brands are Elgato and Hauppauge. These two companies make external devices that connect to your computer and record gameplay from the console. You can also get a PCI capture card for your desktop computer, such as the Black Magic Design Intensity Pro. Cards like this are less user-friendly, as they will need to be installed yourself, but they tend to be a little more powerful (and expensive)."
