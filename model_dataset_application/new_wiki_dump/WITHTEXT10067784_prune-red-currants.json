If they tear through the stems, the wound won't heal as quickly or as neatly. You can use these methods to prune white currants and gooseberries as well. These methods will not work on blackcurrants.

This will allow more air and light to reach the middle of the bush, which means that you'll get more growth and less disease. In most cases, pruning in late winter will be just fine. If you planted the bush in fall, however, you should definitely wait until spring before pruning. Plan on keeping about 10 or so outward growing stems."

Unlike blackcurrants, redcurrants grow best on older stems. Once the stem hits 4 years though, it won\u2019t produce many berries, if at all.

Since berries like to grow on older stems, focus on pruning off the newer ones instead. Keeping the older stems will allow them to continue to grow berries. Trimming the newer stems will help encourage growth and give you a bushier plant. Try to finish on an outward-facing leaf rather than an inward-facing leaf."
