          "description":"Most cameras will have a tab in the menu labeled \"Quality,\" which is where your resolution settings are. Keep in mind that some cameras won't list the resolution in megapixels. Rather, it will show a series of icons indicating different qualities/sizes. For instance, the icons may list \"L,\" \"M,\" \"S1,\" \"S2,\" and \"S3,\" meaning \"large,\" \"medium,\" \"small 1,\" \"small 2, \" and \"small 3.\" However, it may also list megapixels and/or pixels by height and width. Lower-end cameras may not have this option. With these types of point-and-shoot cameras, you usually get a fairly high-resolution image, though. Higher-end cameras are likely to take photos with more resolution than lower-end cameras. However, higher-end cameras may not have lower resolution settings at all. You can't change the resolution on photos in iPhone's native camera app. On an Android phone, you may be able to change the resolution in the camera app's settings. Non-native apps will allow you to do more."

          "description":"In this case, larger means more megapixels, which in turn means higher resolution. Pick the \"large\" icon and click okay to select it. If your camera lists quality in pixels or megapixels, always aim for the largest number. \"Raw\" is the best option if your camera has it. Otherwise, choose the jpeg setting."

The curved icon generally means better quality compression, giving you a better photo overall. For instance, you may have an \"L\" with a curved icon and an \"L\" with a stair-step icon."

          "description":"If you let the camera auto-focus and set the exposure automatically, it will change between shots. That will lead to problems when you try to stitch the images together later. Line up one shot to set the focus and exposure, then keep it the same through all your shots. However, use auto-ISO if you can, as it will adjust for you. Otherwise, pick a low ISO speed. For shutter speed, use one that's 1/(2xthe length of your lens). For 135 millimeter lens, you'd want 1/270. This is more difficult to do on a phone. However, if you use continuous burst mode, the camera will likely keep the same focus and exposure throughout the shots."

          "headline":"Use a longer lens to take a series of smaller shots.",
          "description":"A longer lens, as opposed to a wide lens, limits the scope of the shot. That means you get more resolution for your image, as you're focusing on a smaller area. Aim for a lens that's 135 millimeters or longer. Similarly, turn your camera or phone so you're taking pictures in portrait mode. Width-wise, you're taking in less of the subject at a time, so it leads to higher resolution when you stitch the pictures together. You can take a picture of pretty much anything using this setting, as long as it's fairly still. Since you're taking multiple shots, you can focus on a small area or take a wide landscape shot."
