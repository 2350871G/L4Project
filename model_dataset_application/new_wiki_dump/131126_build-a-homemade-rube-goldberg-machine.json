You can create the building plan by listing these steps or drawing the machine. For example:\nTask: Pop a balloon. Step 3: A tack will pop the balloon. The tack will be attached to the front of a toy car. Link 1: The toy car will slide down a wooden ramp. Step 2: A pendulum will swing into the car and push it down the wooden ramp.
