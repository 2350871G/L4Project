          "description":"The ripeness of your chosen orange will play a major part in how easy it is to peel. When selecting the perfect orange for peeling, look for one with a bright orange color, which is pretty firm and heavy for its size. Try to avoid older fruit with wrinkled or bruised skin, as it will be harder to peel and will not taste as good. Oranges which are still slightly green or light orange in color may be slightly unripe and will be harder to peel as the skin will stick tightly to the fruit."

To roll the orange, rest it on a flat surface and place an open palmed hand on top. Apply a light pressure and roll the orange for 10-15 seconds. Just don't press too hard - you don't want to squish your orange!"

          "headline":"Holding the orange in one hand, puncture the skin with your thumbnail.",
          "description":"Try to make the puncture near the top or bottom of the orange, rather than around the sides. This is because the skin along the sides of the orange is thinner and adheres more tightly to the fruit. The looser and thicker skin at the top of the orange will come away more easily and is less prone to breaking. Some people advocate using your four fingernails to make the initial puncture, but this is more awkward and gets too much skin under your fingernails! Letting the nail of your thumb grow a little longer than the rest of your fingernails may also help with your orange peeling."

Hold the orange over a plate in case you do happen to puncture the skin. This will make cleanup easier after you are finished peeling. Alternatively, a piece of paper towel will do the trick."

Once you become really skilled at orange peeling, you may be able to peel an orange in one peel. This is achieved by tearing the skin off in a circular motion around the circumference of the orange, until you're left with the fruit in one hand and the twisted, snakelike peel in the other!"
