          "description":"To make a cake stand using a large decorative candlestick as a base you will need several different supplies. Get a 10-12 inch microwave plate to serve as the plate on your cake stand. If you have an old microwave you aren't using you can use the plate from that, or you can buy one at a local discount or second-hand store. Buy a large decorative candlestick. This will serve as the base for your cake stand. You will need sandpaper and gorilla glue to secure the base and plate together. You will need a colored spray paint as well as a glossy clear coat to paint the cake stand."

Most generic cake stands are white or black, but if you are having a themed party you might want your cake stand to match the d\u00e9cor. Apply the first coat of paint, making sure the color is even. Allow this to dry completely. Apply a second coat of colored spray paint and allow the item to dry. Lastly, apply a clear coat to seal in the color and provide shine. Let these dry completely before using the cake stand. Add other decorations to your cake stand, such as ribbons or stickers after the paint has dried."
