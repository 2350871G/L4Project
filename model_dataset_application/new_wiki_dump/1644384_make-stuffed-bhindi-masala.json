If you have whole peanuts, you may increase the flavor and aroma by roasting approximately 2 tbsp (30 mL) peanuts in a dry pan over medium heat. Stir continuously for 3\u20134 minutes, then remove the nuts from heat. Wait a couple minutes for them to cool before chopping with a knife or crushing roughly with a mortar. If you have pre-crushed peanuts, or pre-roasted peanuts, skip this step. Crushed nuts area easily burned by roasting, which ruins the flavor."
