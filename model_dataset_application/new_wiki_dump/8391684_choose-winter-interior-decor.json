There's no right or wrong, so follow your instincts and please your own taste. Cold color schemes include white paired with either blue, burgundy, emerald, gray, plum, or silver. Warm colors also include white, as well as browns, reds, and yellows.

But whether or not you celebrate that holiday, search the aisles or online for decorations that don't tie directly into the holiday. Use these to decorate your home throughout the winter season, even after you've packed all the Santa stuff away. Items to look for include figurines, framed pictures, snow globes, wreaths, and garland. Neutral designs include snowmen, sleighs, winter villages, and bare or snow-covered evergreens."

          "description":"Again, if you want to go hog-wild about it, feel free to make your home a winter wonderland with any number of appropriately themed decorations. But if time, budget, and space is limited, use them wisely. Consider:\nChoosing one fanciful item to stand out as a seasonal centerpiece in a given area, like a model winter village to top a mantelpiece, bureau, or window seat. Replacing everyday items with seasonally decorated ones, like dish- or hand towels, salt and pepper shakers, and placemats. Investing in seasonal pillow cases, blankets, comforters, and/or even sofa- and armchair covers to quickly punch up areas like bedrooms, living rooms, and dens."

          "description":"Between school and holidays, both fall and winter can be busy times of year, so plan ahead to minimize work. As you decorate for each season and/or holiday, use items that will still be appropriate as you roll over to the next so you can minimize work. For instance:\nRed, yellow, orange, and brown scream autumn when bunched together, but each is a warm color that can help make your winter home more inviting. Say you decorated your living room with throw pillows in all four colors for fall. Simply take away the yellow and orange ones and leave the red and brown pillows. Hanging wreaths with bare branches is a  popular way to decorate for both fall and winter. Simply swap the autumn leaves with more winter-appropriate flair like holly leaves, oranges, or leaves painted in cool colors like blue or silver. Evergreen garland and pine cones are Christmas favorites, but on their own they work just as well for the whole winter."

Choose candlesticks or holders that enhance the winter theme either by color, design, or both. Enhance the effect by burning scented candles that fill the house with pleasing smells that highlight the season. Gold or brass candlesticks provide warm colors and reflective surfaces, enhancing the light and suggestion of warmth. Mugs, bowls, and jars filled with readymade candles and decorated with seasonal designs are also widely available. Popular scents for winter include cinnamon, cloves, oranges, pine cones, and various types of wood. Alternatively, you can also use LED candles if you're worried about fire risks or forbidden to use candles."

If you have an accent chair, pile extras on the seat so family, roommates, and guests can help themselves as needed. Don't be mingy with them; the more, the better! Choose neutral-colored throw pillows and blankets to use year-round. This way, you can easily dress up each seating area with just a couple of new winter-themed blankets and/or pillows."

Choose whichever color or design highlights the season best for your tastes, but favor thick, heavy fabrics to suggest more warmth and protection from the cold outside. For the best insulation, choose thermal curtains, which are designed to prevent heat from escaping while also blocking drafts from the windows. If you miss the sunlight in winter and still want to let it in without keeping the drapes shut all day, you can also find thermal-backed vertical blinds that allow more light to pass through with minimal heat loss."
