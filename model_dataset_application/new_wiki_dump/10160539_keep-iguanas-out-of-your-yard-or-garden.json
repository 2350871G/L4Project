Removing vegetation such as flowering plants and shrubs can help tame your iguana problem. Alternatively, protecting your plants using mesh and wiring can help guard them from being a source of food. Make sure to plant wire at least 1 foot underground so that the plants are protected from being accessed from underneath, as well."

For the best results, start the metal approximately 18-36\u201d from the ground. Although iguanas love all types of foods, citrus fruit seem to be the exception. So if you have these types of trees, you can still protect them, but they will likely not be an iguana food source."
