Otherwise, expect them to last between three to five weeks when stored in the pantry. So err on the side of caution and make your noodles within the next three weeks. If needed, you can store them in the fridge to make them last longer. Refrigeration should make them last between two and three months."

Expect the skin to be pretty darn tough on its own, too, which can make them turning into noodles tougher. Make life easier and skin each one with a potato peeler. Even though you\u2019re peeling them, wash each one under cold running water before you start. The blade of your peeler can transfer dirt and chemicals to the flesh if you don\u2019t."

Refer to your make and model\u2019s instructions on how to properly attach your blade and operate the machine, since these vary. Generally speaking though, you prop the sweet potato lengthwise between the blade and the handle, then crank the handle to force the potato through the blade. Expect sweet potatoes to require applying more pressure than other vegetables do. If needed, slice off both ends to the potato before you start so they\u2019re both flat. If you don\u2019t have a spiralizer, you can shred them with a julienne peeler instead."

Stir them around in the oil to coat them, and/or use a pair of tongs to toss them. Stir or toss frequently as you cook. For crisper noodles, remove after five minutes.

If you\u2019ve ever handled a sweet potato before, you probably know that the flesh is pretty hardy. Expect the skin to be pretty darn tough on its own, too, which can make them turning into noodles tougher. Make life easier and skin each one with a potato peeler.

Spray a roasting pan with cooking oil. Spread your noodles in the pan and mist them with your cooking spray. Place the pan in the oven and roast for 10 to 12 minutes. Adding Sauces Try a spinach-cashew cream. First, place your cashews in a bowl, cover them with water, and let them sit for a couple hours or more (the longer they soak, the softer they\u2019ll get). Drain them in a strainer and then place them in a food processor or blender. Pulse to chop them up a bit, then add your salt, garlic, and \u00be cup of water.
