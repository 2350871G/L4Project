          "description":"One of the main features of dal makhani is that it\u2019s creamy and rich. To get the right consistency and texture, the beans must be soaked so that they become soft. Place the beans in a large bowl and cover them with 3 to 4 cups of water. Allow them to soak overnight. If you don\u2019t have time to soak the beans, place them in a large pot with water, and bring them to a rolling boil for five minutes. Turn off the heat, cover the beans and water with a lid, and let them sit for an hour. The black lentils that you use for this dish are also called black gram and urad dal. You can also use split black lentils if you prefer."

          "headline":"Cook the beans.",
          "description":"After soaking, strain the beans and discard the water they were soaking in. Place the beans into the pressure cooker with 4 cups of water. Lock the lid and heat the pressure cooker over high heat until it reaches proper pressure. When the pressure cooker whistles the first time, reduce the heat a little and continue cooking the beans over medium\u2013high heat for about 10 minutes, until the beans are soft. If you don\u2019t have a pressure cooker, cook the beans over medium\u2013high heat in a lidded pot for 45 minutes to an hour. Remove the beans from the heat when they're ready."

Stir the mixture regularly so the garlic doesn\u2019t burn. Burnt garlic becomes bitter, and this will change the flavor of the dish."

          "headline":"Add the tomatoes, chili powder, and turmeric.",
          "description":"Add the ingredients to the onion mixture and turn the heat up high. Cook for five to 10 minutes, until the tomatoes soften and reduce to a thick pulp or sauce-like consistency. Continue stirring regularly to prevent the tomatoes from burning to the bottom of the pan. You can also substitute tomato paste for some or all of the tomatoes to give the dish a deeper color and richer flavor."

Mashing the beans will thicken the dal and give the dish it\u2019s characteristic creamy texture. If the mixture is too thick, add some fresh water. The dal should be about as thick as a thick soup."

Use heavy cream for the richest flavor, or regular cream or milk for a slightly lighter version. Taste the dish before serving and add more salt if desired. You can also stir in a pinch of dried fenugreek leaves to give the dal a slightly sweet and nutty flavor."
