  "text":" Cleaning Up Basic Spills Start with water. For basic spills, just plain water will do the trick. Use a soft rag, and apply warm water to the surface. You can use this method to wipe up spills, as well as small stains. Wipe with clear water once the stain is up. Wipe in the direction of the grain.

That includes abrasive sponges and steel wool, but it also includes very hard water or gritty (dirty) water. Wait until the appliance is cool. If you're cleaning an appliance like an oven, a stove or a toaster, it's a good idea to wait until it's cool before cleaning. Lightly touch the appliance. If it feels cool, it's fine to clean it. Using Professional Products Try stainless-steel specific products. Many products on the market are designed specifically for stainless steel. Because they are designed for stainless steel, they are more likely to keep your appliances looking sparkling. You could try CLR for stainless steel, for instance. Use a glass cleaner. In some cases, a glass cleaner with ammonia may work on spills. Make sure to check for bleach before using them, as you don't want to apply bleach to stainless steel. Skip products with chloride. Products with chloride in them can be harmful to the surface of stainless steel, particularly brushed stainless steel. Therefore, you should avoid cleaners with bleach when working on these surfaces. Avoid oven cleaners. If the area is extra greasy or on the oven, you might be tempted to use an oven cleaner.

One way to keep your brushed stainless steel sparkling is to wipe it down often with a little soap and water.

No matter what product you use, make sure you rinse it off when you're done. You don't want any product to sit on the surface of the stainless steel, as it could damage the surface over time. Dry the surface thoroughly. When water is left on brushed stainless steel, it can leave water stains on the surface. Therefore, use a soft cloth to dry off the water when you're done rinsing.
