They\u2019re often sweeter and more tender than regular beetroot, but they can be more expensive and hard to find. Try your local farmer\u2019s market during the winter. Golden varieties like the Lutz Green Leaf have a bright gold color that won\u2019t stain as much as a regular beet. If you dislike the earthy flavors of standard beetroot, try the Cylindra or the Detroit Dark Red, both of which are sweet and tender. If you\u2019re worried about stains, try the Chioggia.
