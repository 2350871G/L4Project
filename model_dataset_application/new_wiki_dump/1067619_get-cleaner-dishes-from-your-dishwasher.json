          "description":"The dirt and grime from your dirty dishes doesn\u2019t magically disappear after you run a dishwasher cycle. Make sure the filter isn't full of gunk from your last cycle. If it is, check your owner\u2019s manual about how to remove it. Then simply wash it in the sink with some dish soap and a sponge, rinse off the soapy water, and put it back in place. A clogged filter is one of the most common culprits behind dishes that come out dirty after a cycle. That\u2019s because the dirty water from the last cycle didn\u2019t drain entirely. This means you\u2019re washing the next batch with the same icky water. If your filter looks really foul after you take out, you may want to soak it in hot water and dish soap for up to an hour. Also, instead of a sponge, use something more abrasive, like a nylon bristle brush.

He has a Bachelors in Business Administration and Management from Baruch College. Raymond Chiu\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Director of Operations, Maid Sailors\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: A dishwasher stops running well when it isn't cleaned often enough, especially when food debris and mineral buildup get stuck in the machine. First, clean the drain of any food particles. Then, run a cycle using a cup of white vinegar. You should also clean the dishwasher once a month to keep the dishwasher running smoothly."

          "description":"Like the filter, a clogged spray arm can lower your machine\u2019s performance. That's because the clogs will block the fresh water that's supposed to be washing your dishes. Check your owner\u2019s manual on how to detach the spray arms. Then, once you have them out, check all the holes along each arm to make sure they\u2019re clear. If they\u2019re gunked up:\nUse steel wire, cable, or even a wire hanger to poke the clog out. Then give the hole a quick flossing. Follow that up by soaking them in distilled white vinegar. That will break up any gunk that your flossing couldn\u2019t dislodge."

Many dishwasher detergents are designed to stick to those bits of food, so you actually want to leave them! Only rinse them off or give them a soak if you don\u2019t have enough for a full load just yet and you\u2019re worried about attracting pests. In that case, it\u2019s usually better to run them through a rinse-only cycle in your machine if it offers that option. If you rinse or soak them in the sink, don\u2019t use dish soap.

For instance, angling bowls so they\u2019re at a 45-degree angle means you can fit more inside than if you lay them upside down.
