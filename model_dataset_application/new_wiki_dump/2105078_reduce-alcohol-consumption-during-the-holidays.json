      "headline":"Eat a full, healthy meal before drinking any alcohol.",
      "description":"Having food in your stomach will help slow down your body's absorption of alcohol, and can help prevent you from becoming inebriated at a fast rate. Food that is high in carbohydrates and protein can reduce the effects on alcohol on your body. Eat snacks while you drink alcohol to help keep your stomach full throughout any holiday event. For example, eat appetizers or finger foods at parties, or bring a small bag of your own snack that is high in protein, such as nuts."

      "headline":"Drink your alcoholic beverages at a slow pace.",
      "description":"If you can sip your drinks, or take breaks between drinks, you can avoid becoming inebriated and help reduce your overall alcohol consumption. For example, if you plan on being at a party for 4 hours, have 1 drink every 2 hours. Drink water, juice, or other non-alcoholic beverages in between alcoholic beverages if you feel fidgety, or want to continue drinking liquids throughout the holiday event."

Prepare an answer ahead of time if you fear that you may give in to an offer of alcohol. For example, inform others that you have to work early the next day, or that you made plans for an early-morning workout if they try to persuade you to keep drinking alcohol."
