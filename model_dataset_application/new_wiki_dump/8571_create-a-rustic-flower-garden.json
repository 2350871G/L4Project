Your garden should be somewhere where you can easily see it and appreciate its beauty, preferably from both inside and outside your home. Also think about some of the following:\nDoes the area you have in mind get enough sunlight for the type of flowers you want? Does the area have good soil drainage, or does it tend to accumulate a lot of standing water after rainstorms and snow thaws? Is your potential gardening area on relatively flat or gently sloping ground? It is much more difficult to plant on steep slopes."

Make a quick sketch of your property, indicating any buildings, decks and patios, the driveway, fences, or any other major features. Don't forget to consider the drainage patterns in your yard. Also mark in any pre-existing gardens, shrubs, or trees. Once you've made your starting sketch, you can start roughing in your ideas for flower beds. In addition to flowers, try sketching in other elements you'd like to add to your garden, like stone walkways and borders, fences, trellises, or garden sculptures."

A few good choices include:\nHollyhocks. These tall, brightly-colored flowers are an excellent choice for planting along walls and fences. They are hardy in zones 3-9. Hydrangeas. These are low, broad shrubs that produce massive, spherical clusters of delicate flowers, typically ranging in color from white to pastel blue, pink, or purple. They are hardy in zones 4-9. Roses. These classic flowers make a gorgeous and fragrant addition to any garden. They come in a wide variety of colors and sizes, from big red \u201cEl Toro\u201d roses to tiny pastel tea roses. Depending on the variety, they can thrive in a number of hardiness zones. Coneflowers. These sturdy, daisy-like flowers come in a variety of colors, including white, pale purple, and crimson. They are also attractive to birds and butterflies. They are hardy in zones 3-9. Catmint. This fragrant herb is easy to grow, produces delicate sprays of purple flowers with attractive silvery foliage, and has the added benefit of repelling mosquitoes. It is hardy in zones 4-8."

Think about how the colors of the flowers you pick might look together, and how they will complement the colors that already exist around your home and yard. Consider how the plants or flowers will change colors throughout the seasons and year. Many plants have beautiful foliage in the fall and winter. Cool, pale pastels can give your garden a dreamy, fairy-tale look. Warm reds, oranges, and gold tones give a garden a homey, comforting feel, especially in the summer and autumn. Bright, gem-like colors, like vibrant reds, yellows, blues, and purples, can create an attractive complement to dark or muted colors on your property."
