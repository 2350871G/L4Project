  "text":" Prepare the Dough Combine all of the dry ingredients into a food processor and pulse them a few times to ensure they're well mixed.  Dice the chilled butter into cubes and add it to the dry ingredients.  Pulse the mixture until it resembles breadcrumbs. It's important to do this fairly quickly so that the butter doesn't have a chance to melt. Add the egg next and pulse for longer increments until combined. The mixture should begin to clump together. Dump the dough onto a clean cooking surface and shape it into a ball.  Wrap the dough ball in cling film and refrigerate it for 30 minutes.  Unwrap the chilled dough and turn it onto a piece of wax paper on your counter top.  Begin to flatten it with your hand.  Place a piece of cling film on top of the flattened dough and roll the dough out with a rolling pin until it's 2 centimeter (0.8 in) thick.  Peel off the cling film and slide the wax paper and dough onto your cutting board.  Grease your pie tin with the remaining tablespoon of butter.  Place the greased tin on top of the dough, facing down.  Flip the board and pie tin right side up and remove the board from the top of the pie tin.  Use your hands to gently push the dough into the corners of the dish.  Pierce the base of the pie crust with a fork numerous times to create a place for the steam to eventually escape when it bakes.  Place a new piece of wax paper on top of the dough and place pie weights or beans on top of the wax paper. This is to help prevent the base of the crust from rising and bubbling as it cooks. This process is called blind baking. Baking Blind bake the pastry for 20 minutes at 430\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).  Remove the crust from the oven, take out the weights and greaseproof paper, and return it to the oven for another 5 to 7 minutes to ensure that the base of the crust will not be soggy.  Finished. ",
