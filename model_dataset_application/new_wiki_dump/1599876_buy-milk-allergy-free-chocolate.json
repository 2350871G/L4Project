As well as walk-in stores, you may be able to find these stores online, either via their own websites or through an intermediary website such as an auction site. Don't forget boutique chocolate makers. Many such makers pride themselves on using the very best chocolate from some of the renowned chocolate growing areas of the world, and they are less likely to adulterate fine quality chocolate with milk. Check which manufacturers are happy to send their dairy-free chocolate products overseas to you if you don't find local stores (either real shopfronts or online stores) in your area or country. Be sure to check with customs about any charges on such foods coming in to your country."
