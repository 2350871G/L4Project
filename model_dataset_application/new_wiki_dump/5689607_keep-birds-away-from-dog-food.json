  "text":" Feeding Your Dogs on a Schedule Feed your dog twice a day. Dogs stay in the best shape if they eat two meals a day. Feed your dog only as much food as it will eat in ten minutes. That way, it'll all be eaten and leftovers won't remain to entice the birds. Wait ten minutes. Allow your dog ten, supervised minutes for mealtime. In general, birds will not bother your dog while it is eating. If any birds should show up, you can scare them away yourself. Remove any leftover food. After ten minutes, pick up the dog's bowl and wait until the next scheduled feeding time. Your dog will adjust his eating patterns to get all the nutrition he needs in two ten-minute feedings. After a period of one to two weeks your dog should be adjusted to this new feeding regimen. If your dog has not adjusted after two weeks, consult your vet for advice. Storing Dog Food Properly Store food in animal-proof containers. In addition to keeping birds from stealing the food in your dog\u2019s dish, you must keep birds from getting into your dog food supply. A great way to do this is to invest in an animal-proof dog food storage container. One option is the Vittles Vault. Such storage containers are available at pet stores and online. Retain original packaging. The bag that dog food comes in helps protect the food from oxygen and humidity. Rather than dumping the contents of the bag into a pet food storage container, place the entire bag inside. This will further protect your dog\u2019s food from birds and other animals while helping to keep the food fresh. Keep dog food indoors.

If you want birds to stay out of your dog\u2019s food, one course of action is to repel them from your yard altogether. A simple and inexpensive way to deter birds is to hang noise-making chimes and bells. Most birds dislike the sounds of these ornaments and stay away. Put up \u201cflashy\u201d d\u00e9cor.
