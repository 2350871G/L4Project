Having to digest food whine under the stress of a move can cause unnecessary stress for fish. Dismantling and Transporting Your Fish Tank Carefully remove your fish, snails, crabs, and any other animals from the tank. You can do this with fish nets or plastic cups. Put the animals in appropriately-sized containers or plastic bags of aquarium water. Make sure there is room for air in the containers and make sure your fish are not crowded. Turn off your filters, heaters, and pumps and drain 80-90% of the water from your tank into clean buckets. Keep enough water in the bottom of the tank to keep the gravel wet during transport. This will help your tank retain much of the good bacteria and make the return of your fish less stressful. Remove any decorations that could damage the tank during transportation. Leaving the gravel in the tank, remove items like heavy rocks or other large decor. Put any removed decor in a clean container or plastic bag. Any live plants should be removed and transported in containers of aquarium water. Place your filter and/or your filter media in a container of aquarium water. This is essential to maintaining your fish tank's ecosystem (also known as its cycle).

Make sure your tank, buckets, and containers of fish are all secure in your vehicle. You can stabilize them easily in the footwells of your car and secure them to prevent any jostling with blankets or towels. Drive carefully! Put your tank on its designated stand or table in its new location. Refill your fish tank with the old tank water that you saved prior to transporting. Set up all of your equipment inside the fish tank. For example; filters, heaters, pumps, light, etc. Turn them on. Replace your decor and plants. Make sure you don't have too many big air bubbles underneath any caves or hides. Take the bags containing your fish and float them in your tank. This allows your fish to adjust to the temperatures in the tank before being put back in the aquarium. Keep an eye on the water temperature in your tank. After it reaches the ideal temperature, wait about an hour. Then you can begin gently pouring your fish back into the tank from their bags. After Setting Up Your Fish Tank Keep an eye on your fish for the next few days. Your fish will be a little lethargic or stressed for a day or two but will likely return to their normal selves once they adjust.
