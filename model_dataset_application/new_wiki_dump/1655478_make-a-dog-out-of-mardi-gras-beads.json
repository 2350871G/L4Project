Cut a string of beads twelve beads long and another two beads long. These pieces will form the body and the ears. Twist four beads together behind the second bead on the long string. This will make a little square. One bead should be sticking up. This is the tail of the dog. Do the same thing to the other side of the long piece except that after you twist the beads, 2 beads should be sticking out for the head. You should have one bead in between the the two sets of little squares. Wrap the two beads behind the first bead on end with the two beads sticking out. This will make the ears and completes the dog. Finished.  Mardi Gras bead poodle Cut four segments from the plastic bead necklace. Cut one segment with 4 beads and three segments with 2 beads. Lay out the 4-bead segment. Pick up one of the smaller segments. At the space between the tip of the 4-bead segment and the second bead in that same segment, pull the small segment up so that the small segment crosses in between the beads on both segments.  Tighten the ears. Do this by twisting them around once. Repeat with the other 2-bead segments. Except, this time, pull the small segments down instead of up, so that the ears stick up.
