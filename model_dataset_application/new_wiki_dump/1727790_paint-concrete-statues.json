          "description":"It should take a few minutes to dry, depending on how warm the air is. Air drying the statue will kill any moss that\u2019s left behind. Concrete statues look more pristine when they\u2019ve been dried in the sun and when they don\u2019t have any moss on their surfaces. Don\u2019t leave concrete statuary to dry outside in the winter, because moisture will collect in its pores, causing it to expand and eventually crack."

          "description":"Choose a putty that is the same color as the statue, or close enough. So, if the statue is white or gray use silver or gray putty. Break off a couple pieces of epoxy putty or however many you need to fill in each crack. Smooth it over using a wet spatula or a knife and let the putty dry for 3 to 4 hours. You can find epoxy putty in craft stores. Wear gloves when handling epoxy putty to protect your skin from irritation. Use a blow dryer to set the putty quickly. You can use epoxy putty to replace missing pieces from a concrete statue, such as toes. The putty becomes hard as a rock once it\u2019s dried, so no one will know a toe was ever missing."

Concrete is porous, so the water will pull the paint further in to make the base coat more permanent. Have a container of clean water ready for drenching the statue.

When you water down a basecoat, the concrete absorbs it and stains better. There is no recommended ratio of water to use. If you plan to use an antiquing or detailing method on the statue, choose white paint for the base coat."
