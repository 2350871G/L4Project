Pierce the clay with a needle all the way through until you reach the inner air pocket. Keep in mind, some clays aren\u2019t meant to be hardened, such as oil-based modeling clay, so check the packaging of the clay that you\u2019re using to make sure it\u2019s possible! If you don\u2019t have an air pocket in your model, don\u2019t worry about creating vent holes! Be sure to pierce at least 1 hole for each air pocket to ensure proper venting. For example, many clay models of animals have an air pocket inside to make them lighter. Additionally, jewelry like earrings and pendants can have air pockets, especially if they\u2019re very intricate pieces."

Ceramic holds heat well and prevents the temperature from changing too quickly when the oven door is opened. Avoid using metal or glass, which tend to fluctuate in temperature."

As soon as you\u2019re finished covering the model in 1-2 coats of paint, fire up the oven to prepare for baking. Adding a glaze or paint might add to the baking time of your model. In general, for each coat or paint or glaze, add 3-5 minutes onto the baking time."

As a general rule, bake for the amount of time specified on the package for each \u20444 in (0.64 cm) of thickness. For example, if the package says to bake for 15 minutes, and your clay is \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick, then you would bake the clay for 30 minutes. If you\u2019ve lost the packaging, it\u2019s generally safer to bake at a lower temperature for a longer period of time, like 30-40 minutes."

Carefully transfer the model to the pot, and submerge it in the ice bath for at least 30 seconds to prevent the clay from over-baking. Then, carefully remove the model with your hands or a pair of tongs. When you remove the clay from the oven, it might be somewhat soft on the outside, and some tools, like tongs, can leave marks and indentations on the hot clay. Only use the tongs to remove the clay from the ice bath, not put it in. If you\u2019re not sure how to transfer the model, try submerging it while it\u2019s still on the ceramic."

The drying time will vary based on the thickness of the clay and the moisture in the air, but most types of air dry clays will be completely dry within 72 hours. If your clay isn\u2019t hardening after 12 hours or so, try increasing the temperature by blowing the clay with a hair dryer, or placing it in the oven on the lowest temperature for 1-2 hours. Check on the clay often."

To smooth them over, dip your fingers into a glass of clean water, and rub the water over the imperfection a few times to smooth it out. If you notice larger cracks forming throughout the drying process, you may need to rework the project by reviving the clay. This involves adding a small amount of water to the clay, and placing it in a plastic bag to sit for about 10 minutes. Then, knead the clay and continue adding small amounts of water until it is usable."

You should do this about halfway through the drying time, which will vary depending on the type of clay you\u2019re using. When handling the clay, be very careful.

Then, let the paint dry for 24 hours, and protect the paint by using a spray-on or brush-on paint sealant all over the clay. If you\u2019re making an intricate design on a clay pot, for example, make sure you use a thin, fine paintbrush, and seal the entire pot after the paint has dried."
