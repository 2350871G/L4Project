  "text":" Steaming Lobster Tails Put a steamer basket in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid. The pot should be big enough to accommodate your lobster tails. If you don\u2019t have a steamer basket, you could use a small metal colander to keep the tails from being submerged in the water. Add 2 inches (5.1 cm) of cold water to the pot and bring it to a boil. The amount of water will vary based on how large the pot is, but aim to fill it a couple inches. The basket or colander should keep the lobster tails out of, but close to, the water. Then, cover the pot with the lid and bring the water to a boil on medium-high heat. Cut the lobster tails down the center and remove the vein. Use sharp kitchen shears to cut the exoskeleton, or shell, of the lobster tail down the center. Avoid cutting the meat or cutting into the tail fan. Spread the shell apart with your hands, then pull or cut out the vein running down the middle. Place the lobster tails in the steamer basket and cook for 4-12 minutes. Remove the lid and carefully add the lobster tails to the steamer basket or on top of the colander.
