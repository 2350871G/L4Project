Although it sounds like an ordeal, the process is actually quite simple. Mix water and Masa together in ideal proportions, press out, and fry up quickly over a hot surface. Flour or corn tortillas \u2014 which to choose? Flour tortillas tend to have a softer, sweeter flavor. Yet the classic Mexican taco calls for homemade corn tortillas, where the meat takes center stage. Then again, the only thing that matters is what tastes good to you. Experiment with both and choose for yourself. Crispy or soft taco? Again, the choice is up to you. It's easy to make a taco crispy by frying it in oil, but many authentic Mexican recipes call for soft tortillas. Adding two tortillas or just sticking with one? Many places in Mexico will serve two tortillas per taco. It's more filling, it helps keep the ingredients from breaking through a single tortilla, and it's an easy way to get rid of staler tortillas. If you're sticking to the more calorie-conscious meal, opt for only one tortilla."

Combine the following ingredients and allow to sit for a few hours:\n1 onion, finely chopped\n1 head cilantro, finely chopped\n2-3 limes, juiced Alternately, make a pico de gallo salsa. Pico de gallo is a simple mix of tomato, onion, garlic, cilantro, and lime. It's a kind of salsa that many people associate with tacos and, like onion relish, is quite simple to make. Prepare a tomatillo salsa. Whether you want to cook your salsa verde in a crockpot, oven, or over the stove, the basic idea is all the same: Cook tomatillos, onion, garlic, and jalape\u00f1o peppers over heat, and blend with a little bit of lemon and/or lime juice.

Common garnishes include radishes and lime wedges, although you might get a little more fancy with pickled onion or other pickled vegetables such as carrot. Devour your tacos and make your guests proud. Make Carne Asada Combine the wet and dry ingredients in a blender. In a blender over high, combine the following ingredients:\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n1 jalape\u00f1o, seeded and minced\n1 tsp (5 ml) ground cumin seed\n1/2 cup (125 ml) chopped fresh cilantro\nSalt and pepper, to taste\n1/4 cup (60 ml) lime juice\n2 Tbsp (30 ml) white vinegar\n1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) sugar\n1/2 cup (125 ml) olive oil Combine the carne asada marinade with 2 pounds of flank- or skirt steak in a sealable plastic bag. Allow the meat to marinade for anywhere from one hour to one day. After 4 hours, the difference in taste becomes pretty much negligible. Do not marinade for longer than one day. Set up your grill. After you've gotten your coals red hot, dump them into your grill. Safely move all the charcoals over to one side, effectively creating a hot side and a cooler side. You'll use the cooler side to cook the carne asada for most of the process, and then sear the meat on the hot side at the very end to develop color and extra flavor. Grill your steak over charcoals to the desired doneness. Start the meat off on the cooler side of the grill, keeping the lid closed, but flipping often. Check the steak periodically with a thermometer \u2014 or use the finger test \u2014 to test for doneness. 120\u00b0F (48.8\u00b0C) = Rare\n130\u00b0F (54.4\u00b0C) = Medium rare\n140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) = Medium\n150\u00b0F (65.5\u00b0C) = Medium well\n160\u00b0F (71.1\u00b0C) = Well done When the steak is about 15\u00b0F (8.3\u00b0C) from being cooked to your desired doneness, move it over to the hot side of the coals. Use this opportunity to give the steak good color and added flavor. When the steak is about 5\u00b0F (2.8\u00b0C) from being cooked to your desired doneness, remove it from the grill and let it rest. Your steak will continue to cook even after it has been removed from the grill. Don't underestimate the importance of letting the steak rest. If you cut up the steak right away, it will give up all its juices, creating a drier steak. If you let the steak rest for at least 5 minutes, however, it will remain moist and flavorful even after cutting into it. For tacos, dice up your carne asada and add it to your tortilla. Top with onion relish and tomatillo salsa. Make Adobo Lightly toast 3 ounces of dried chiles over medium heat in a saucepan. Any chiles will work, but New Mexican, Ancho, or Californian chiles work particularly well. Make sure your chiles are red so your adobo sauce has its distinctive red color. When the chiles are toasted, soak them in enough boiling water to cover completely. Use a small plate to keep the chiles completely submerged. Soak for approximately 30 minutes. Reserve soaking liquid. In a blender, combine wet and dry ingredients. On a high setting, combine the following ingredients in a blender:\nChiles\n1 cup reserved chile water\n\u00bd tablespoon oregano\n\u00bd tablespoon cumin\nHalf an onion\n3 cloves garlic Brown your roughly diced meat in a large skillet over high heat until good color develops on most sides. Traditional adobo sauce is often served with pork shoulder, but you can also use beef chuck or even chicken. Do not fully cook meat in this step \u2014 meat will cook fully in the next step. After meat is browned, add adobo sauce to meat and simmer until meat is fully cooked.  Remove meat from adobo sauce and add to tortillas. Top with onion relish, guacamole, and serve. Make Carnitas Preheat the oven to 275\u00b0F (135\u00b0C). You'll be slow-cooking the carnitas for a longer period of time for extra juiciness and tenderness. Cut up 3 \u00bd pounds of pork butt roast (also called pork shoulder or picnic roast) into 2-inch chunks. Carnitas calls for a fatty cut of pork, so butt roast is the ideal cut to work with. If you'd like, trim off any large pieces of fat from the pork as you cut the chunks. Although it's not necessary, it does make a healthier carnitas. If you leave the fat on the pork pieces, much of it will render into the pan while it cooks, coating the carnitas and making them even juicier. Place the butt roast pieces into a casserole dish, with several ingredients. You can boil your carnitas or simmer them on the stovetop, but you get the most consistent results baking your carnitas, them broiling them for a crispy finish. Place the butt roast pieces into the smallest casserole dish you have, with:\n1 white or yellow onion, peeled and quartered\n4-6 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled\n2 tablespoons lime juice (about 1 lime)\n2 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n1 teaspoon dry oregano\n1 teaspoon ground cumin\n2 bay leaves\nThe juice of 1 orange, with the orange rind itself (quartered)\nsalt and pepper Place enough liquid into the casserole dish to just fill the carnitas completely. Which liquid you choose is up to you. Know that if you choose to cook with oil instead of a non-fatty liquid, your carnitas will turn out much juicier. Of course, it won't be healthy, but it's okay to splurge a little for the sake of a true delicacy. Here are some options you can use to cover the carnitas:\nVegetable oil\nRendered lard\nWater\nOrange juice Cover the casserole dish with aluminum foil and place the carnitas in the oven for approximately 3 hours. After an hour, the carnitas should reach a temperature of about 208\u00b0F (97.8\u00b0C), and stay there until the meat has finished cooking 2 hours later. Remove the carnitas from the casserole and, once cool, start breaking apart with your hands or a fork.  Heat up the broiler and place the shredded carnitas on a baking tray for several minutes. Broil until the tops of the pork become crispy and darken. Stir the carnitas with a fork and brown again under the broiler for several minutes. When done perfectly, you'll have crispy carnitas that's still succulent and tender. Add the carnitas to your tortillas and serve. Top with onion relish and tomatillo salsa. Make All-American Tacos Sweat 1 diced onion in a well-oiled skillet over medium heat. This should take about 3 minutes. Add 16 ounces of ground beef (sirloin works best) to the onion and brown over medium high heat. This should take 3 to 4 minutes. Break up the ground beef into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Add taco seasoning to the beef, stirring until coated. Follow the instructions on the packet about how much seasoning to add. Usually, it's recommended to add 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef.
