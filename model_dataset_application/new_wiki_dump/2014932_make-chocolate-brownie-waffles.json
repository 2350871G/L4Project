  "text":" Prepare your waffle iron. Clean it with a damp cloth if dirty. Lightly grease the grids with non-stick cooking spray. Plug in the iron and close the lid. Most waffle irons have a small light on the top to indicate the iron is ready to use. Melt your chocolate. Place the squares in a bowl and microwave at 15 second intervals until melted. Stir the chocolate in between to evenly distribute the heat. Combine the sugar and oil in a large bowl. Use an electric mixer. Add the melted chocolate to the sugar and oil mixture and mix.  Separate the eggs. Place the yolks in a bowl and the whites in a mixing bowl. Set the egg whites aside. Add the egg yolk and vanilla extract to the chocolate mixture and beat well. Place this aside as well. Combine your dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) in a smaller mixing bowl.  Add the dry ingredients alternately with milk to the chocolate and mix thoroughly. Begin and end with dry ingredients - this means to add a third of the dry mixture to the chocolate and half the milk. After mixing, add the second third of the dry ingredients and the last half of the milk and mix. End off with the final third of the dry ingredients. Set aside. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Fold in the egg whites into the batter gently. Don't stir the mixture as this will cause the egg whites to lose their volume. The air cells in the whites will expand and make a light and crisp waffle. Pour the batter into the center of the waffle iron (about 125 mL or 1/2 cup is enough) using a measuring spoon or ladle. Evenly spread the batter with a rubber spatula. Close the waffle iron and let bake for about 3-5 minutes or until steam no longer escapes.
