Think about items that might remind you of your own trips to the beach. You can include anything from plastic birds or fishes to toy buoys or small nets. You can also go for a more minimalist beach vibe and only include seashells. One of the best things about making your own beach at home is that you can keep adding to it whenever you like. Experiment with different amounts of sand and seashells or try a rotating seasonal look. If you're more a fan of a minimalist look, you can use only seashells to decorate your container."
