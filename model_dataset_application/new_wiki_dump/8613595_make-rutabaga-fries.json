Next, use a piece of parchment paper to line a large baking sheet for the fries. You can substitute foil for the parchment paper if you prefer. It\u2019s important not to place the rutabaga fries directly on the baking sheet, though, because the edges will burn more quickly."

Use a vegetable peeler to take off the skin, and then use a sharp knife to cut the rutabaga into strips that are approximately \u00bd-inch (13-mm) thick. The exterior of some rutabagas are coated with wax to lock in the moisture. If yours has a waxy film, it may be easier to use a knife to peel it."
