For about a cup of water, consider using about \u00bd a teaspoon of mild detergent. Use your old toothbrush to mix up the water and soap until some bubbles start to form. You could also use a small amount of bleach if your shoes are white, but be aware that bleach can potentially yellow the canvas fabric. A mild detergent is the safer bet."
