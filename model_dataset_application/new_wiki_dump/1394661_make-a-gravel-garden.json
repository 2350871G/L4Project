          "description":"Carefully remove the plants that you want to keep and place them to the side of the garden or in pots temporarily. When digging up the plants you want to keep, be sure not to sever any of the roots or separate the root ball at the bottom of the plant. If you\u2019re going to be doing the project over a few days, wrap the roots of the plant in a plastic bag and mist them with water to keep them alive. Removing the weeds before you begin working will keep them from growing back once you lay the gravel."

          "headline":"Till the soil with compost or manure to encourage growth.",
          "description":"Adding compost or manure to your gravel garden will improve the soil composition and make it easier for the plants to grow there. Use a rake or garden till to dig about 4 inches (10 cm) into the ground and mix the dirt and compost or manure together. If you come across any large stones, put them to the side to incorporate into the gravel. You can find compost or manure at most home improvement stores or nurseries, or you can make your own compost pile at home."

          "headline":"Dig a border around the garden and add an edger to improve drainage.",
          "description":"If you have heavy soil, such as clay, you\u2019ll need some extra drainage for the garden. Get enough edger, which is a metal strip, to border your entire gravel garden. Bury it 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) deep so it\u2019s level with or just above the ground. The edger will define a permanent border between the gravel garden and your lawn or other garden beds and keep the gravel in place. Then, dig a border about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) wide and 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) deep around the garden inside the edger. Fill the border with gravel to increase air in the soil and remove excess water that the plants can\u2019t use. For gardens with regular soil, this step isn\u2019t necessary, but adding a border won\u2019t hurt your garden if you like the look of it."

          "description":"Most weed membrane comes in large strips. Simply roll out the membrane and cut it to fit the shape of your garden. Be sure to use sharp scissors because the membrane can sometimes be difficult to cut. Then, lay the next strip with about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of overlap on the sides. Try to keep the membrane in straight lines to avoid wasting any material."

Place the rocks or staples about 2 feet (0.61 m) apart on the overlapping areas of the membrane. You can find landscape staples at most home improvement stores, or you can order them in bulk online. The number of staples needed will depend on the size of your garden and how many pieces of weed membrane you'll use."

          "description":"Cacti, succulents, grasses, daisies, Mediterranean plants, and many herbs will thrive in the gravel garden because they require less water than other plants. Look for plants like lavender, yucca, lilies, juniper trees, lilacs, or stonecrop at your local nursery or home improvement store. If you have soil with a lot of clay in it, select larger and more established plants to ensure that their roots will attach to the soil when you plant them."

          "description":"Once the membrane is in place, you can organize your garden how you\u2019d like. Place your plants in groups of 2-3 different flowers or shrubs that look good together. Then, use scissors to cut a cross in the soil that is big enough to fit the roots of the plant when the flaps are folded back. For an eye-catching look, pair flowers, like lilies, with large shrubs, like juniper trees, to create a pop of color when the flowers bloom. Try to avoid planting smaller plants, like stonecrop, underneath of large bushes that might cast a shadow on them for part of the day. Make sure you give the plants enough space to grow to their full width! For most plants, their maximum size will be listed on the tag or you can look it up online. Avoid cutting a hole for the plant, because this makes the weed membrane useless in that area. Cutting a cross allows the membrane to be as close to the plant as possible to protect it from weeds."

Lower the plant into the ground and cover it with the soil, pressing on the ground around the roots of the plant to level the ground. Add compost to the hole to provide extra nutrients for your plants. This is especially important when using a membrane/weed barrier as the soil beneath the gravel won\u2019t be naturally enriched with organic matter. Avoid letting soil fall onto the membrane while you\u2019re planting. If some does get onto the membrane, wipe it off before you lay the gravel."

You can order the gravel in bulk or buy it in bags from the  home improvement store. You can add large rocks or boulders to the area before you spread the gravel to add variety.

For areas that don\u2019t get a lot of rain, water the garden once per month or more depending on your climate and the needs of your specific plants to ensure the plants have enough water.
