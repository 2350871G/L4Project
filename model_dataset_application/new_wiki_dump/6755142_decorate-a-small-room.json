          "description":"Pick neutral colors, such as white, tan, or light grey, to paint your walls. Apply large areas of paint with a foam roller, and work around your trim and corners of your room with a paintbrush. Once your room is a lighter color, it will seem more open. If you're not sure which color you want to use, buy several paint samples, then paint large 2 ft (0.61 m) by 2 ft (0.61 m) swatches on your wall. Let the paint dry, then spend a few days living with the different colors on your wall. Choose the one that you like the best after seeing how the paint looks under different types of light. Don\u2019t paint your walls if you\u2019re renting your home. If your room feels too empty after you paint it, use a patterned or textured decoration to warm up the space.Tip: Pick a wall in your room to be an accent wall. Use a different color of paint or decorative wallpaper to add a pop of personal style to your room."

          "headline":"Arrange mirrors throughout the room to add more depth.",
          "description":"Mirrors reflect the space, making it seem like your room is bigger. Pick 1 large mirror or arrange smaller mirrors on your wall to make a more interesting piece. Position your mirrors so they can reflect natural light if possible to brighten up your room. Simply lean a body-length mirror against the wall if you can\u2019t put holes in the wall. If you don't want a lot of mirrors in your room but still want to add more depth, use items with reflective surfaces. You can use shiny pieces of art, glass-topped furniture, metal jewelry boxes, glass lamps, and other similar objects."

          "headline":"Keep larger items along the walls to free up floor space.",
          "description":"Leave space in the middle of your room so you can get around easily without tripping over your furniture. Keep couches, beds, hutches, or any other large furniture pieces around the perimeter of the room rather than in the center. Arrange your furniture so that you have the most floor space available as possible. You want to feel like you have a bunch of open space. However, make sure your furniture isn't so tightly packed that you can't freely open doors or pull out drawers. For example, if you have a small bedroom, keep your bed and dresser pushed into the corners of your space so you have clear and open walkways. If you have large furniture, consider downsizing so you have even more room."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Hang long curtains above your window to make them seem larger.",
          "description":"Install the curtain rod as close to the ceiling as you can. Get curtains that extend all the way down to your floor and frame your window inside them. The long curtains create the illusion that your windows are much larger than they appear. Avoid using blackout curtains since they\u2019ll restrict light from entering your space. Instead, pick a light color. Instead, create the effect of blackout curtains by installing Roman shades under your light curtains. This allows you to block out the light when you need to while still enjoying bright daylight most of the day."

Consider getting rid of or donating anything you haven\u2019t used in the last 6 months or that doesn\u2019t fit your style. Keep an inventory of your belongings so you can easily determine what you can and can\u2019t get rid of. Clutter will visually shrink your space, making it appear even smaller. Make sure your dresser and nightstand are very neat and organized."

Find multipurpose furniture, like a bed where the headboard is a bookshelf or an ottoman that opens up. Consider getting furniture that you can fold up or push against the wall, like a futon or Murphy bed.Tip: Get a loft or bunk bed for your bedroom so you can have extra storage space or even a small work desk underneath."

If you have the wall space, consider putting 2 or more of the same shelves together to have an accent wall with storage. Some bookshelves will get top-heavy if you place a lot of items on the top shelves, so secure them to the wall. You can store anything on a bookshelf, even items like clothing and accessories.

Add shelves over your furniture to add functionality and extra decoration while still maximizing your floor space. For example, you may install shelves above your toilet in the bathroom to hold decoration or common toiletries. Make sure to hang the shelves high enough so your head won\u2019t hit them."

If you place a chair in the corner and you still have space behind it, place a tall floor lamp to add lighting or hide a small storage space behind it."

Once you attach them to the door, hang clothes, towels, shoes, or toiletries for added storage that\u2019s out of sight whenever the door is open. Plastic hanging shoe racks work great in closets for holding cleaning supplies or in a pantry for holding different spices. You can also hang your mirror on the back of the door to help save space."

Find a rug that fills up most of your room, leaving about 12\u201318 inches (30\u201346 cm) of open floor between the rug and the wall. You can also layer rugs for a more dynamic look. Choose a bottom rug that's about the same size as your room, then put a smaller rug on top of it. For example, you might layer a brightly colored rug on top of a neutral colored rug. Choosing Different Rug Sizes for Your Room\nFor a living room, pick a rug the same length as your couch to hold a coffee table or set the furniture on top of a rug that fills most of the room. For a dining room, get a rug large enough so you can comfortably sit at the table while all of your chair legs are still on the rug. In most cases, an 8 by 10 ft (2.4 by 3.0 m) rug is large enough. For bedrooms, use a rug that extends at least 24 in (61 cm) from the edges of the bed."

Find plants like succulents or cacti if you want plants that are low upkeep. Changing the kind of flowers you keep is a great way to keep your room updated and looking new throughout the year. Use artificial plants if you don\u2019t want to care for living ones. Some plants are poisonous to cats and dogs. If you have pets, check if the plants you want are poisonous before you buy them.
