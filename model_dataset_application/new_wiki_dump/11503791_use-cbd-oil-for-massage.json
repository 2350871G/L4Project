Look for products that come with a certificate of analysis (COA) containing information about how the product was tested.Warning: Don\u2019t buy CBD products from a retailer or dispensary if they can\u2019t or won\u2019t share information about how their products are tested.

          "description":"It\u2019s against FDA regulations for a company to claim that their CBD product can treat or cure any diseases or health conditions. If the manufacturer\u2019s claims about their product seem too good to be true, they probably are. This is a red flag that these products may not be safe or reliable. For example, be cautious of claims that CBD oil products can treat, cure, or prevent conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, or arthritis.

          "description":"CBD by itself is thought to be fairly safe when applied topically. However, some topical CBD products may contain other ingredients that can cause irritation, allergic reactions, or other health issues. Check the ingredient label closely to make sure it doesn\u2019t list any ingredients you want to avoid. For example, if you have sensitive skin, watch out for products that contain perfumes or dyes. Since topical CBD is usually dissolved in a carrier oil, check that the carrier isn\u2019t derived from a plant that you are allergic to. For instance, avoid using CBD in an almond oil carrier if you\u2019re allergic to almonds or almond oil. In addition to allergens and irritants, you may also want to avoid other potentially harmful ingredients, like parabens."

          "description":"CBD topicals come in a variety of strengths, which are usually measured in milligrams (mg). For example, a 600 mg product will be significantly stronger than a 150 mg product. If you need more powerful relief or want to use a smaller amount of the product with each massage, go for a higher concentration of CBD. Keep in mind that more concentrated products will be more expensive than those with smaller quantities of CBD in them."

          "description":"Topical CBD treatments can also contain other cannabinoids, such as THC. Since both CBD and THC have pain relieving and anti-inflammatory properties, you may find a combination of the 2 even more helpful than CBD alone. If they are legal in your area, look for products advertised as \u201cfull spectrum,\u201d which contain all the cannabinoids found in the hemp or marijuana plant, rather than just CBD. THC is the compound in marijuana plants that causes you to feel high if you smoke or ingest marijuana. There\u2019s also a very small amount of THC in hemp. You\u2019re unlikely to experience a high from using a product containing THC on your skin. You\u2019d have to use a very concentrated oil over a very large portion of your body to feel any significant psychoactive effects."
