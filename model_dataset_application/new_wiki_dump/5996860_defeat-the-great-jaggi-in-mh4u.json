The recommended approach is to have at least 5 to 8 defense on each piece of armor.

The GJ has some audio cues for attacks if you lose sight of him, they consist mostly of grunts and roars. Attack. If you're using the Insect Glaive, try to land five consecutive air attacks (R+B+X) to mount him. If he tries to flee, stun him with a flash bomb. This will give you a chance to do a crushing blow. When he is limping, he will try to flee. If he is sleeping in his nest, plant barrel bombs while he's sleeping to most likely OHKO him."
