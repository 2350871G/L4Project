Don\u2019t wash black shirts with red clothing as red dye can bleed onto the black fabric and give it a crimson sheen."

Always adjust your washing machine\u2019s water temperature to cold or select a cycle that uses cold water before putting your black shirts in. It\u2019s rarely necessary to wash any clothing with warm or hot water. It just wears them out faster and even can set stains in permanently rather than getting them out."

          "description":"Pick a light-soil setting on your washer so the shirts will be in it for less time. This cuts down on the agitation and tumbling time, so the fabric of your black shirts won\u2019t wear out as fast.Tip: If you have any black shirts that are delicate, such as silk or linen shirts, wash them on a delicate cycle or consider hand washing them. If your black shirts are covered in mud or something like that, it\u2019s OK to pick a longer cycle meant for more heavily-soiled clothing. However, for regular washing always use the shortest cycle you can."

          "description":"Purchase a detergent that is meant for dark clothing and cold washes. Read the directions on the packaging to add the correct amount for the number of shirts and other laundry you are washing. For example, if the packaging says to use 1 cap full of the liquid detergent for light loads and you are only washing a few black shirts, use 1 cap full. These types of detergents help preserve dark colors longer and can even make them appear darker and richer. Don\u2019t ever exceed the amount of detergent recommended by the manufacturer. Too much detergent can leave streaks and soapy residue on your black shirts."

          "description":"Add the salt to the water in the washing machine the very first time you wash a black shirt. This will prevent bleeding and lock in the black color so it looks new for longer. You can do this for clothing of all colors to keep the colors from bleeding."

Use the amount of a fabric softener liquid recommended by the manufacturer if you prefer to use a commercial fabric softener. Either of these will lubricate the fabric fibers during washing so they don't wear out as fast and start looking faded."

If you absolutely must dry your black shirts in the machine, do so only with other black items and use a low-heat, short cycle time setting to avoid breaking down the fabric and wearing it out by overdrying.
