They may ripen at any time throughout the winter, though you can harvest the oranges all at once once you see they are ripe. By contrast, Valencia oranges take a full year to grow. They bloom in the spring and grow all through the winter well into the next summer. They will have both a bloom and the fruit in the summer, when you harvest the fruit from last year."

Check your particular variety to see what it should look like when ripe. For instance, Valencia oranges might still have a bit of green on them, even when they're ripe. Navel oranges, on the other hand, should be all orange. Don't worry about brown spots on the surface of the orange. They just mean your area is particularly sunny or humid."

Finally, do a quick \"snap\" motion, breaking the orange away from the stem. You can also cut the branch right at the top of the orange using a small pair of clippers.

Using a sack allows you to keep both of your hands free while you're picking. Any cross-body bag will work, but a shoulder sack will have more room for the fruit. You can find fruit-picking bags online. Be gentle with the fruit. While oranges are relatively hardy, you can still bruise them, leading to a damaged crop."

When placing a ladder, turn it sideways to slide it between branches, then turn it flat against the trunk once you are through. This method helps protect the tree. Practice ladder safety when picking. Check to make sure the ladder is secure before climbing, and have someone spot you by holding the ladder when possible."

Picking when the fruit is wet can lead to a condition called oleocellosis, also known as oil spotting or green spotting. Oleocellosis happens when the fruit swells slightly due to wet weather. If you squeeze the fruit, you release the oil from the glands underneath the skin, causing the spotting."

This mixture helps remove dirt and pesticides and will also help kill any mold spores left on your oranges. Rinse the baking soda mixture off when you're done. Shake the excess water off the oranges. Let them air dry on a towel on the counter, using a fan to help the process along. Don\u2019t store damp oranges."

If you can place them in a small separate refrigerator, try holding them just above freezing at about 33 \u00b0F (1 \u00b0C) to keep them fresh for up to a week longer.

To zest an orange, use a zester, which looks like a grater with extra-small holes. Grate the outside of the orange like you would a piece of cheese. However, keep turning the fruit so you only zest the orange part. The white pith is bitter."
