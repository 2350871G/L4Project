          "headline":"Choose a color palette and stick to it.",
          "description":"Pick 2-3 accent colors that complement your furniture and wall color, and choose accessories that follow the color scheme. The main accent color should appear in the room at least 3 times to really stand out. For example, if your seating is gray, and your walls are white or tan, you might choose turquoise and yellow as your accent colors. If most of your furniture is brown, you might pick warmer colors, like burgundy and violet, as your accents. As an alternative to using accent colors, choose a monochromatic theme. You could do your living room all in neutrals or shades of blue, for instance.

Katherine Tlapa\t\t\tInterior Designer\t\t\t\tKatherine Tlapa, an interior designer, advises: \"Living rooms look best in neutral colors. If you have warm colors in your space, stick to warm tones like taupe, beige and warm grey. If you have cool colors throughout your home, use cool tones like cool grey, light blue, and bright whites. You can have an accent wall too, which is popular.\""

          "headline":"Draw inspiration from a piece of fabric or art that will be in the room.",
          "description":"Most pieces of art and fabrics are designed with color theory in mind, so they\u2019re great for inspiring a theme. Pick 2-3 main colors from the item, and think about why you like the style of that particular item. For example, you might have an old painting of an open field with a farmhouse that incorporates green, grey, and pastel blue. You could create a rustic farmhouse theme that includes those colors as accents, and position the painting as the focal point of the room. Alternatively, use a favorite piece of furniture for inspiration. For example, design the room based off of a floral-patterned sofa with curved lines."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Apply a fresh coat of paint to coordinate with your new color scheme.",
          "description":"Start by picking out the most neutral color in your color scheme, like a tan, light gray, pastel yellow, or light blue. Carefully prime, and then paint all of the walls with 2-3 coats of your chosen color. If you don\u2019t have a lot of painting experience, consider hiring a professional for the job. Try to paint the room before you place your furniture, or be sure to protect the furniture with cloths or tarps. If you know you\u2019re going to be living in the home for more than 5 years, feel free to experiment with bolder colors. Use a neutral paint color if you want a versatile space or like to change your decor every so often."

          "description":"Wallpaper is an excellent way to draw attention to one area of the room. Choose a bold, large print that incorporates 1-2 colors in your scheme, and a neutral color such as black, white, brown, or grey. Or, place the wallpaper in a nook or built-in for a subtle effect. Wallpaper prints that are very small, such as tiny florals, can make the room seem smaller. Try to stick with prints that are more than 1 ft (0.30 m) tall and clearly visible from across the living room. When hanging wallpaper, work slowly and carefully. If you don\u2019t have experience hanging wallpaper, consider hiring a professional to do the job for you."

Then, you can position your furniture around that point. If you don\u2019t have a special feature in your living room, make one! You can even use a central table as the focus of the room to encourage conversation. It makes the most sense to use the largest piece of furniture you have as the focal point.

Instead, position your couch or chairs around the focal point of the room, with the back of the furniture away from the wall. Aim to create a seating area in the center of the space. As a general rule, pull seating at least 1 foot (0.30 m) away from the wall to make the room seem more inviting. Pieces like bookshelves are normally built to lean against a wall, so it\u2019s okay to place them there."

Create at least 3 feet (0.91 m) of space between all major pieces of furniture, like sofas, and 18 inches (46 cm) between minor pieces, like end tables. Always leave plenty of space in the entryway of a room so that guests can navigate. Don\u2019t block doorways, hallways, and major pass-ways in the room. Similarly, don\u2019t face the back of a chair or sofa to the entryway, as this creates a closed-in feel."

Even if the room has a focal point like a television or fireplace, guests will still want to talk to each other. To encourage conversation but also draw attention to the main feature of the room, angle the seating so that it\u2019s facing the focal point, but turned slightly toward the other chairs or couches."

          "description":"Tables are both appealing and functional pieces of furniture. As a general rule, each piece of seating furniture should have some sort of table within reach. If possible, select a coffee table that is light, so you can easily move it if necessary. Your tables don\u2019t necessarily have to match, but they should have a cohesive look. For instance, if your coffee table is reclaimed wood, try to stick with other wooden tables to fit the theme of the room. In addition to choosing tables that fit the look of your living room as a whole, you can also style your coffee table or end tables with additional accents that match the look, such as books or plants."

Make sure it\u2019s large enough to fit under the seating area, but not so large that it takes up the whole room. Position it in the center of the seating area to pull the space together. Area rugs work well even on carpeted floors, as long as they don\u2019t clash too much with the color of the carpet. For added safety on wood or laminate floors, place sticky webbing from the home improvement store under the rug. The webbing will keep it from slipping when someone steps on it!"

If you have an area of your living room that doesn\u2019t get much light, place a table lamp or floor lamp there to brighten up the space as needed. If you want a more coordinated look, pick up 2 matching lamps and place them on opposite ends of the room. Or, update your existing lamps by painting the bases and swapping out the shades. Make sure that the light fixtures and shades are positioned in a way that doesn\u2019t obstruct anyone\u2019s view."

Try to avoid having more than 2-3 pieces of art in the room, as it can make the space feel overly cluttered. When in doubt, refer to your color scheme for art inspiration! Pick pieces that have meaning to you. For instance, if you really like Van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night, buy a print of the image and have it framed."

On the couch, position 1-2 throw pillows at each end, and, if the couch is longer, place a pillow in the middle as well.

Pick a blanket in one of your accent colors, or choose one that is an interesting fabric, like faux fur. If you have a lot of different throw blankets, consider making them a feature of the room by leaning a wooden ladder against a wall. Then, fold a blanket over each rung so that they\u2019re on display, and guests can take one to use if they want to!"

Position them as an art feature, or make a special corner of the room just for your hobby. For instance, if you write in the living room, set up a small writing desk with a notebook, pen cup, and a unique chair along a wall or near a window. If you like to listen to records or read magazines in the living room, consider getting a stand for your record player or a magazine rack to place in the room.
