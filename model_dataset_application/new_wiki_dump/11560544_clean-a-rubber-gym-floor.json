          "description":"Before mopping or using an automatic scrubber on your rubber gym floor, it\u2019s helpful to first vacuum up some of the surface dirt and debris. Make sure that you use a vacuum with rolling, soft brush bristles (such as a vacuum with a carpet setting), as this type of vacuum is less likely to scuff or damage the rubber material. While it won\u2019t be as quick or effective as vacuuming, you can also use a broom and dustpan to sweep up dirt and debris."

          "description":"If there\u2019s anything stuck on your rubber gym floor, such as gum, you can use a plastic or wood scraper to loosen it off the flooring. To do this, gently push the scraper under the stuck-on material, angling the scraper down towards the floor while pushing the material up. Make sure that you don\u2019t press down too hard into the floor, as the scraper could scuff or damage the rubber material. Once you\u2019ve lifted the stuck-on material, you can use a vacuum to clean it up off the flooring."

          "description":"In a large bucket, mix 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Then, use a cleaning rag or sponge mop to spread the cleaning solution across the gym floor. The hot water and vinegar solution will disinfect your gym floor without damaging the rubber material. To leave your flooring with a fresh, clean smell, add a squeeze of lemon or a few drops of your favorite fresh-smelling essential oil (such as eucalyptus) to the disinfecting solution. If the floors are particularly dirty in some areas, you can use a soft bristle hand brush to gently scrub the disinfecting solution into the flooring."

          "description":"To create a rubber-safe cleaning solution, fill your mop bucket with warm water. Then, add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) to \u20444 cup (59 mL) of a neutral pH floor cleaner or dish soap, depending on how large your rubber gym floor is. When looking for a rubber-safe floor cleaner, look for cleaner with \"neutral pH\" on the bottle. For example, OdoBan Neutral pH Floor Cleaner, Bona Free and Simple Neutral pH Cleaner, and Zep Neutral Floor Cleaner are all great options. Avoid using a solvent-based cleaner, such as hardwood floor cleaner or bleach, as these can damage and corrode the rubber on your gym floor. Try to use as little floor cleaner or dish soap as possible. While both of these options are gentle on rubber flooring, they can leave a small amount of residue after each cleaning that can build up over time and damage your gym floor."

Work your way towards the door so you don\u2019t have to walk over any flooring you\u2019ve already moped. You may need to spend a little extra time mopping in harder to reach areas or scrubbing up touch dirt spots or stains.

To change the water, dump the dirty water out into the sink and refill the bucket with warm water. Then, remix the water with your neutral pH floor cleaner or dish soap. Mopping with dirty water can make your floors dirtier instead of cleaning them. Therefore, it\u2019s important that you change the water to avoid spreading germs and dirt."

Walking on the floor while it\u2019s still wet can track dirt and debris across the floor and make it stick to the floor. Allowing the floor to air dry will also give them chemicals in the soap time to kill germs."

As a general rule of thumb, only use floor cleaner with your scrubber every 5th clean.
