          "description":"By this point, you should probably know where in your house you want to put the bookshelf. The first step will be to measure that area\u2019s height and width. Then determine a depth that it acceptable to you for your shelving. Measure twice to make sure you got accurate measurements. Be sure to measure the width from both the top near the ceiling, the middle, and lastly the bottom near the floor. This is because not all rooms\u2019 walls, ceilings, and floors are perfectly square. You would want to be aware of this before you cut your supplies!"

          "description":"Once you have your measurements, begin with your desired depth and draw a straight line that distance away from the first edge of the plywood for the path you will cut. Using a table saw, you will cut the plywood into straight sections of that width. Remember the cut made by the table saw will take 1/8\u201d out of the board. In order to maintain the full desired width of the shelf, position the table saw\u2019s blade 1/8 inch outside the line you drew for your width. After you complete that cut, measure your width from the freshly cut edge to the desired shelf width again. Once again, cut outside your mark and repeat until you have produced the number of shelving lengths you have determined you will need."

Cut along the top side of both the left and right ends of what will be your very top shelf. Continue in 1/8 inch increments, cutting inward until the width of each end\u2019s rabbet joint is as wide at the plywood.

Securely clamp the pegboard on top to use as a template to drill through in order to create a grid of nice, even holes to insert pegs, allowing for adjustable shelving. Take care with the depth to which you drill your holes. You should go no deeper than 1/8 inch less than the length of the pegs you intend to use to support your shelves. This way the pegs do not get stuck in the holes and there is enough left sticking out to adequately support your shelving. The best way to drill a consistent depth is to place a piece of tape on the drill bit and drill each hole just until the tape meets the surface of the board. Begin by drilling 2 inches in from the front and the back edges and 4 inches above the bottom. Continue working your way up drilling pairs of holes through the pegboard every 2 inches until 4 inches from the top."
