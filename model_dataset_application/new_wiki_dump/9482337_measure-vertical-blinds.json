  "text":" Choosing an Inside or Outside Mount Go with an inside mount for a cleaner look. With an inside mount, the blinds sit inside the window or door frame. This allows the blinds to blend in with the window or door for a clean, streamlined look. Choose an outside mount for a frame without depth. An inside mount requires that the window or door frame has a certain depth in order to fit the the blinds. For vertical blinds, you usually need 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 4 inches (10 cm) of depth for an inside mount. If your frame isn\u2019t deep enough, you\u2019ll need to go with an outside mount. Hide an unattractive window or door with an outside mount. Because an outside mount hangs the blinds outside the frame, it can cover up the window or door. If you choose large enough blinds, you can actually conceal all of the unsightly feature. Make a window look larger with an outside mount. An outside mount covers up some of the area around the window so it can make the window appear larger. This can give your room a more balanced look. Measuring for an Inside Mount Measure the width of the window in three places within the frame. Start at the top of the frame interior and pull the tape measure from one side to the other. Next, move the tape measure down to roughly the center of the interior frame and measure from side to side again. Finally, use the tape measure to measure the bottom interior of the frame. Hold the tape measure so it\u2019s parallel to the ground for all three measurements. Use the smallest measurement as the width. After you\u2019ve measured the interior frame\u2019s width in the three spots, compare the measurements. The smallest number is the proper width for the blinds to ensure that they clear the sides of the frame. Run the tape measure from top to bottom in several spots. Pull the tape measurement from the top of the frame interior to the bottom on the left side. Next, move the tape measure over to roughly the center of the frame, and measure from top to bottom again. Finally, place the tape measure on the right side of the frame from top to bottom. Use the smallest measurements as the height. Once you have the three height measurements, compare the figures. Use the smallest measurement as the blinds\u2019 height to be sure that they\u2019ll clear the opening from top to bottom. Preparing for an Outside Mount Measure the width of the window or door. If the window or door has trim around it, pull the tape measure from one side of the trim to the other so it\u2019s parallel to the ground. If there isn\u2019t any trim, you can measure from any point on one side of the frame to the other to create an area that you want the blinds to cover. For maximum light control and privacy, you may want to add up to 4 inches (10 cm) of width to each side. Determine where the blind headrail will be installed. For the height measurement, start by figuring out where you want the blinds to hang from. In most cases, the headrail is installed at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the window or door opening. Mark the spot with a piece of painter\u2019s tape. Run the tape measure from the headrail location to the sill in 3 locations. Once you\u2019ve determined where the headrail will be installed, run the tape measure from that point to the door or window sill on the left side. Next, move the tape measurement to roughly the center of the window or door at the headrail site, and measure the height again. Finally, run the tape from headrail location to the sill on the right side of the frame. Use the smallest measurement as the height. Compare the three height measurements. The smallest figure is the height. However, if you want to cover all of the window or door or make a window appear larger, you may want to add 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) to the height measurement for the blinds.",
