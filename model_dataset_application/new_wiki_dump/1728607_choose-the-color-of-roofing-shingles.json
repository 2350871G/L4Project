          "description":"Shingles can create contrast with your siding materials, or they can blend in with the other design features of your home. If you want to go the traditional route, stick with gray, brown, or black shingles. For a contrasting pop of color, opt for reddish-orange shades or lighter tan colors. You can also choose to incorporate a mix of colors, like gray and black or tan and brown shingles for a staggered effect. Siding and Shingle Color Combinations\nIf your house is white, gray, yellow, or blue, stick with gray or black shingles to create a stately-looking contrast. For red or yellow brick houses, choose between black, brown, and gray shingles. With natural siding, like stone or earth-toned vinyl, opt for brown or tan shingles to coordinate with the exterior of the home."

          "description":"Drive around several neighborhoods to get an idea of what color of roofing would look best on your home. Look for houses with a similar shape, exterior, and color as yours. Note which roofing and siding pairings seem to look the most appealing to you, and search online for houses that are architecturally similar to yours. For example, a ranch house might look good with a combination of colors while a traditional colonial would benefit from shingles with one solid color. A Spanish style home might look good with reddish clay-colored roof shingles which would mimic traditional clay roofing tiles, for example."

If you live in a warm climate, install this type of roof to help lower your electricity bills and improve the longevity of your roofing materials. If you don\u2019t want to install a true cool roof, remember that white or light shingles reflect sunlight and help keep the temperature of your home down. Dark shingles absorb heat and will help homes in colder climates stay warm. They also help melt snow and ice from your roof. Understanding Cool Roofing\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, a cool roof is any form of roofing that is designed to reflect more light than traditional roofing. Some methods of cool roofing involve using reflective paint, installing a covering for the shingles, or simply replacing dark shingles with light shingles."

          "description":"Today, shingles are available in a variety of different materials. Visit a store to get a feel for all of the options, and don\u2019t be afraid to choose a shingle type other than asphalt. Keep in mind that asphalt shingles tend to hold up well over time in various climates, while materials like clay and slate can break easily. Remember that shingles made of different materials will usually require an additional installation fee, due to their fragile nature. Exploring Different Shingle Materials\nClay: Clay tiles are traditionally shades of red or tan. Most clay tiles are fired in a kiln before being installed, which ensures that they will hold their color for a long time. Slate: This natural rock can be cut into thin shingles and used for roofing material. Slate tends to be quite expensive, and the colors are limited to shades of gray. Wood: Wooden shingles, or shakes, are made from cedar, redwood, or pine trees. They tend to have a natural brown color and are popular in areas of California and the Northwest United States. Wooden shingles are prohibited in some areas due to low levels of fire safety."

For example, if you have a ranch house with brown stone siding, choose shades of brown and taupe for the shingles. For brick houses, this might mean incorporating shades of brown and red in your roof. For houses with natural tones on the outside, stick with gray, taupe, and brown for the roof."
