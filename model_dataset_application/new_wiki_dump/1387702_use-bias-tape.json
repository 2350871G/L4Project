Whether you purchase it online or from your local arts or fabric store, you will basically only need bias tape maker to go along with an iron, ironing board, scissors, and sewing machine. You may also use a rotary cutter and mat. Bias tape comes in an assortment of widths, styles, and colours. A bias tape maker can come with a variety of openings which will determine the width of your bias tape. Choose your piece of fabric that you want to use as your bias tape. Before ironing out any wrinkles, spray starch onto the fabric to ensure that it will be easy to work with. Begin with a fabric that measures about 22 inches x 28 inches. Create a bias fold. Take the bottom right corner and fold it upwards toward the top most edge of your fabric. The bias fold will be the line on which you cut. Rotate your fabric so that the bias edge lines up with the cutting edge of your cutting mat. Trim along the bias edge line. Use the cutting edge of your cutting mat to guide you as you trim 1/8\u2033 off the fold of the fabric. Use your cutting mat to realign your cut edge of the fabric. Cut 1 inch strips until you have made 10 strips. Continue to realign the edge of the fabric as you make a new cut. You should make 5 cuts to give you 10 strips that measure 1 inch x 20 inches. Sew the 10 strips together before putting them through the bias tape maker. Form a right angle with the bias strips. Match the bottom right corner of a strip with the top left corner the edge of another strip. The right sides of the strips should be placed together. Pin your strips to keep them in place. Line up the \u215d inch seam guide of your sewing machine with the raw edge of your fabric to keep your strips at a 45 degree angle and seam straight. Use scissors to trim any excess fabric. Open the seams and put the fabric through the bias tape maker. Press the seams so that they remain open. On one end of the fabric, create a 45 degree angle by cutting the fabric. Place this end through bias tape maker. Pull the entire fabric through the bias tape maker. Make sure to continue pressing down to keep the seam open as you pull the fabric through the bias tape maker. The seam will be very subtle and your 22 inch by 28 inch fabric will create 9 yards of bias tape.",
