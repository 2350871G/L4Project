          "description":"Plumbing problems and leaks are among the most common sources of interior moisture that cause humidity in the basement. Leaky pipes, fixtures, toilets, and other plumbing can cause moisture in the house that drips down into the basement, creating dampness and wet spots. Signs of a plumbing leak causing dampness in the basement include water stains and wet spots on the ceiling in the basement. To inspect for leaks that you can't see, check your water meter reading and don\u2019t use any water in the house for 2 hours. Check the reading again after 2 hours. If there's been a change, you have a leak somewhere that needs to be addressed. You may be able to address simple repairs yourself, such as changing a leaky washer, fixing a running toilet, or tightening a loose joint. For larger jobs, or if you don\u2019t have much experience with plumbing maintenance, call in a professional to fix the leak."

Always run exhaust fans in the bathroom when bathing, and run the exhaust fan in the kitchen when cooking. You can also reduce steam by covering pots with lids when you cook, and by taking cooler showers and baths. If you don\u2019t have exhaust fans, open windows when you shower or cook."

To prevent that wetness from ending up in your basement, install a vent if necessary to vent your dryer directly outside. This is most likely a job that will require a professional, because you'll have to cut into the frame of your house to install the vent. The job will likely cost around $200 USD. Inspect hoses and ducts regularly for cracks and holes that could be causing leaks, and replace the duct or hose if you find signs of wear and tear."

To reduce humidity, don\u2019t run humidifiers in the house, and especially not in the basement. To make air in the house less dry, turn down the temperature of the furnace."

Place the dehumidifier in the dampest part of the basement and turn it on. Depending on the size of your basement and the capacity of the appliance, you may need 2 dehumidifiers. Empty the dehumidifier reservoir whenever it becomes full, typically once every 2 days. This will prevent spills and keep the appliance working well."

When the humidity level starts to rise, use the dehumidifier to control moisture while you address the cause."
