Make sure that your clothes, sheets, or towels are loosely packed into the washer to allow for proper cleaning and rinsing, and to prevent wrinkling and pilling. As a general rule:\nA small load will fill about 1/3 of the washing machine. A medium or regular load means that the washer is half full. A large load fills up about \u00be of the washer.
