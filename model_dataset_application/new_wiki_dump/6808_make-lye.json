          "headline":"Collect wood ashes.",
          "description":"To make potassium hydroxide lye, you need the white ashes from hardwood fires. When hardwood trees are growing, they draw potassium from the ground. This potassium doesn\u2019t burn in the fire, and is still present in the ashes after the fire. You can then leach the potassium from the ashes with water. After every hardwood fire you have, allow the ashes to cool for a few days. Then collect the white ashes and store them in metal containers. The best hardwoods for lye water include ash, hickory, beech, sugar maple, and buckeye. To make lye using this method, you'll need enough ash to nearly fill a wooden barrel. Don\u2019t use ashes from softwood trees, as these don\u2019t contain enough potassium."

          "headline":"Collect rainwater.",
          "description":"The second thing you need to make liquid potassium hydroxide lye is soft water. Rainwater is ideal because it\u2019s soft and available in large quantities. Set up a rain barrel in your backyard or under the eaves of your house to collect rainwater. Make sure there's a filter on the barrel to strain out leaves and organic debris. Soft water has lower concentrations of other elements, so it\u2019s ideal for soap making. Hard water will produce soap that doesn\u2019t lather. You'll need at least 10 pints (4.7 L) of soft water to make lye water."

          "description":"After you fill your barrel with ashes, you'll run water through the ashes to leach the potassium. The water needs somewhere to drain out of, so you need to make holes. With a drill and a small drill bit, drill about six small holes into the bottom of the barrel. Concentrate the holes near the center of the barrel so the water will drain into a bucket."

The pebbles should be large enough that they don\u2019t fall through the holes in the bottom. Cover the stones with at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of dried straw. The straw and stones will act as a filter. The lye water will drain down through the straw and stones, leaving the ashes and particles on top."

Place a small potato in the lye water. If it sinks, the lye isn't strong enough. If it floats, the lye is ready. Dip a chicken feather into the lye.

Be extremely careful not to spill or splash the lye water, as it can burn your skin. Replace a bucket under the holes in the barrel. Let the water drain through the ashes again.
