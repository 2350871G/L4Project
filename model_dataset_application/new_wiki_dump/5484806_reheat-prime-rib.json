You can use beef broth or the juice from the cooked prime rib. Close the pouch. Seal up the pouch so that the juices don't escape. Place the pouch in a steamer. Cover the steamer tightly with a lid. Heat the prime rib for 3 to 6 minutes. You may need to heat it longer if the piece is large. Remove it from the pouch and serve.. Be sure to put a plate under the pouch, as juices are sure to leak.  Reheating a Single Piece of Prime Rib in the Oven Set the oven at 250 degrees. Give it time to warm up. Place the piece in a small pan. Pour in several tablespoons of beef broth.
