Make sure that the blade is securely tightened in the blender's base, and that the glass or plastic container (also called the carafe) unit is firmly seated in the motorized base unit. In most cases, an incorrectly assembled blender just won't work or won't work well, but sometimes, loose parts could fly out or you could damage the blender."

If you're using your blender to grind up or chop hard foods, you'd be better off using a food processor. If you do use a blender for making paper or some other non-food purpose, be aware that it may permanently damage the blender. Use a separate, inexpensive blender that you won't mind losing."

          "description":"If you're blending large food items, like big chunks of pineapple, watermelon, or citrus fruits, be sure to cut these into smaller pieces before blending. You can cut things in fairly large chunks; aim for about 2 square inches (13 square centimeters). Smaller chunks will blend more easily and much quicker than uncut fruit. Make sure the pieces of food you're blending are at least small enough to fit into the bottom part of your blender."

          "description":"A mixture that is too dry will behave like a paste and push up away from the blades. This is not necessarily harmful, but it's not too effective, either. Depending on what foods you're blending, you may add different liquids: water, milk, fruit juice, soup stock, and so on. Add a little liquid at a time, then blend and see if the consistency has improved. If you add to much liquid at once, your smoothie could quickly become a thin soup."
