The half-hour period will let the steak warm up to room temperature, at which point the seasonings will stick to the meat. Do not freeze the filet mignon at any point.

Then pick the individual filets up, flip them over, and sprinkle about 1/16 tsp (0.25 g) of pepper onto the other side. Season both the top and bottom to taste, but avoid over-seasoning. The pepper should bring out the filet\u2019s natural flavor, not overpower the taste of the meat. Don\u2019t put any pepper on the sides of the steak."

Shake roughly 1/16 tsp (0.25 g) of salt onto the top sides of the steaks, then flip them over and shake the same amount of salt onto their bottoms sides. You can apply the pepper and salt at the same time, or apply pepper first and follow up with salt. As with the pepper, do not apply any salt to the sides of the filet."

This will make the seasonings adhere to the sticky top of the steak and prevent the spices from slipping off when you transport the steak. If you press too hard, you\u2019ll flatten the filet."

Fold a 6 in (15 cm) piece of aluminum foil loosely in half, and drape it over the plated steaks. Leave the foil in place for 5\u20137 minutes. Then, serve the steaks immediately. This technique is known as \u201ctenting\u201d the foil. It allows the foil to trap the cooked steaks\u2019 heat without coming directly into contact with the meat."
