Many times in video games, the easier levels are used to teach you a new function of the game play. This can be a new way to access secret parts of the game or even a new super power. Skipping over the lower levels via a game cheat code can mean you miss out on valuable insight. If it's an  available game option, save often and before trying new alternatives so you can back out of any situation gone awry. Taking a break from a harder level you are getting frustrated with to play an easier level also gives your brain a break. The anger many people get from video games isn\u2019t usually linked with the game content but instead the frustration. A lower level can also help you to find what made video games fun in the first place. While playing the lower level, focus on the music or graphics."

Take a stimulating breath by breathing in and out quickly through your nose with your mouth relaxed but closed. Do three sets in about a second and then rest with normal breathing. You can do this for up to 15 seconds to give yourself a quick rejuvenating boost of oxygen. You can also try the 4-7-8 exercise. This starts with breathing out completely through your mouth, and then closing your mouth to breathe in through your nose four a mental count of 4 seconds. Now hold it in for 7 seconds and finally breathe out for 8 seconds. Repeat these steps for a set of 4 reps."

For some people really working out hard and sweating has a cleansing feeling and can also be a boost since it releases chemicals to your brain that change your mood for the better."
