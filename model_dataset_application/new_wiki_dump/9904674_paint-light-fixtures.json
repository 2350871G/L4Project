  "text":" Setting up Your Work Station Turn off electricity prior to beginning any work on the light fixture. You can do this by switching off not just the light itself, but by turning off the breaker. This ensures that you will not be electrocuted in the process of your fixture remodel. Paint your fixture outdoors to allow proper ventilation. Not only does open air assist in minimizing any potential chemical fumes you may breathe in from the paint, it also helps control a potential mess inside the home from damaging floors and the surrounding work area. Tape off the surrounding area if need be. If you are painting your fixture while it is still attached to the wall, it's best to tape off the surrounding area to avoid paint going in unwanted places. Loosen the screws just enough to lift the fixture off the wall slightly and apply painter's tape under the edges. Tape around the area thoroughly to protect the walls from getting painted, as well. Clean the light fixture using a degreaser on a damp cloth. Do this to wipe away all dust and dirt from the outside of the fixture. A tack cloth can also be used to help pick up any dust particles stuck to the surface prior to painting. It's only necessary to clean off the outside, as this is the area that will be painted. Remove old paint from the fixture with sandpaper or a chemical paint remover. Sandpaper can be used to roughen up the entire area you will be painting prior to priming, particularly if the fixture is just stained or an unpainted metal.
