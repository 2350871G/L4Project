Even after long periods of use, or in warmer climates, you won\u2019t have to worry about it permanently affixing to your poster. Magic tape is also nearly invisible when used on a smooth surface, making it a very non-invasive technique to hang something. You could also use washi tape. It acts similarly to magic tape, with the added bonus of having fun and colorful patterns on it, allowing for further decorative options."

Make a few of these and place them at the points on the poster where you want to stick it to the wall. Firmly press the putty against the wall it to make it stay in place. Mounting tack can rumple and damage paper at the contact points, and is recommended only for thicker material posters, or those mounted to a backing. Don\u2019t place the tack on freshly or poorly painted surfaces, or you could peel the paint off when removing the poster. Warmer climates can sometimes cause the tack to melt and slide off the wall, or permanently stick itself to the wall or poster."

Place the sticky sides of the tabs face down on the back of the poster in each corner, and remove the film covering before pressing it firmly against the wall to mount it. Use your hands to flatten and smooth out any wrinkly portions of the poster after you\u2019ve put it on the wall. You can remove the poster from the wall without damaging it in any way. The same may not be the case for your poster when you try to remove the tape tabs.

Coat the back of the poster and the canvas in a layer of it, and carefully place the poster against the canvas. Hold it for 30 seconds, then let it completely dry before hanging. Test a small amount of the adhesive on the poster beforehand to make sure it won\u2019t damage it by bleeding through or causing ink to run. You can get canvases of various thicknesses to suit the poster you\u2019re putting on it."
