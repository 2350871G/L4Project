Check your beanie\u2019s care label before to determine what material it\u2019s made from. If the label has been cut off and you can\u2019t determine the material, hand-wash it using cold water to be safe. Warm water can shrink certain materials. Synthetic materials include polyester, acrylic, and nylon."
