Choose something that is shorter than your TV, such as a lamp, and place it on the other side of your TV. Other great options include statues, busts, figurines, and picture frames. If you like symmetry, place identical items to either side of the TV instead. Potted plants or topiaries make great choices."

          "description":"Place matching lamps or vases to either side of your TV, and something long and skinny, such as a wooden planter, beneath it. Make sure that none of the items obstruct the screen. If you put plants into the planter, keep them subtle, otherwise they will distract from the TV. Succulents or silk hydrangea blooms work great. Other great items to place below the screen include candle votives or pieces of driftwood."

          "description":"Drape evergreen branches or garlands along the top of the stand, just in front of the TV. Decorate the garland with ornaments and LED pillar candles. If you want to decorate for other holidays, try some of the following ideas:\nSwitch out the pine garland for one made from silk fall leaves. Decorate the garland with pinecones and acorns. Make paper garlands featuring images from whatever holiday you are celebrating, such as hearts, shamrocks, or bats. Drape a white tinsel garland over the TV stand, then decorate it with plastic Easter eggs."

You can also install doors onto cabinet, then close them when you are not using the electronics. Examples of electronics include gaming counsels, DVD players, music players, etc. If you don't use these items more than once or twice a week, then consider hiding them."

Make sure that the item does not obstruct the diode at the bottom of the TV frame, or you won't be able to use the remote. This option only works for standing TVs. Wall-mounted TVs do not have a base on which to stand. Great options include long candle holders, drift wood, and garlands. You can even line up small items instead."

Instead of stuffing them with plastic tubs or cardboard boxes, choose decorative storage baskets or boxes that match your d\u00e9cor, and use those instead. You can find beautiful, decorative boxes in craft stores and fabric stores. Some are even made to look like decoupaged luggage! Baskets don't have to be woven. You can use fabric ones, crochet ones, or even metal ones! If you can't find a box that matches your d\u00e9cor, decoupage it!"

Cut a piece of decorative paper to fit the top of your cabinet, then secure it with decoupage glue or spray adhesive. Trim the excess edges of the paper off once the glue has dried, then coat the top with a clear, acrylic sealer. Cabinet liners make great choices, and many of them are self-adhesive! Wallpaper makes a great choice, but you may have to use wallpaper glue in order to make it adhere.
