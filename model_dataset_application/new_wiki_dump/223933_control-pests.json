Removing points of entry is key if you wish to keep your home pest free. Use silicone caulk to seal any cracks and crevices in baseboards, moldings, cupboards, pipes, ducts, sinks, toilets or electrical outlets. Place screens in front of heating and cooling vents. Repair holes in existing screens. Install screens and weather-stripping on doors and windows. Keep vegetation, mulch, stacked firewood, and other debris at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) form your home.

It is poisonous to crawling insects like ants, lizards, cockroaches, and silverfish, but is far less toxic to humans. Try tamper-resistant bait boxes, which are safer than sprays, powders or pellets, all of which spread pesticide residues. Bait boxes are particularly recommended in areas where food, plates, or cookery are stored. Look for bait boxes that use a nonvolatile chemical like boron, and be sure to keep them out of reach of children. Try insecticidal or fatty-acid soaps. They kill soft-bodied insects like fleas and mites on contact, cut are practically harmless to humans and mammals, unless ingested."
