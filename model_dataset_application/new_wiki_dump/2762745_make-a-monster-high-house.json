Making a Bed Find a suitable box. A shoe box is an ideal size, as long as it is large, such as at least size 13 for one doll. Make a mattress. Measure the box shape. Use this measurement to cut out 2 pieces of fabric slightly smaller than the box shape. Stitch three sides of these two pieces together but leave open one end.
