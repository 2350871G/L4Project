  "text":" Assemble the Cookie Ingredients Melt the chocolate chips and the butter in a double boiler over low heat, stirring the ingredients frequently with a wooden spoon.  Remove the melted chips and butter from the heat and allow them to cool for a few minutes.  Mix about 1/4 of the cooled chocolate mixture with the egg in a separate mixing bowl.  Pour the egg and chocolate back into the rest of the chocolate mixture.  Whisk in the confectioner\u2019s sugar into the chocolate until it is well combined with the chocolate mixture.  Fold the miniature marshmallows and pecans into the chocolate using a wooden spoon.  Chill the Cookies Spread a sheet of parchment paper onto a work surface.  Place half of the cookie ingredients on the parchment paper and form the ingredients into a log using clean hands. The log should be about 12\u201d (30 cm) long and 2\u201d (5 cm) in diameter. Wrap the log in plastic wrap.  Gently roll the log back and forth to form a uniform cylinder.  Twist the ends of the plastic wrap to make sure that the log maintains its shape.  Place the log into the freezer.  Place the other half of the cookie ingredients onto the parchment paper, forming another log.  Wrap the log in plastic wrap just as you did the first one.  Put the second log into the freezer and chill the cookie ingredients for 2 hours, or until they are firm.  Slice and Serve the Cookies Spread the coconut out onto a large plate.  Unwrap the first log and roll it in the coconut until the coconut adheres to the outside.  Place the log onto a cutting board and slice the log into cookies with a 1/2\u201d (12 mm) thickness. Use a chef\u2019s knife for quick and efficient slicing. Plate the cookies and serve them with a glass of cold milk. ",
