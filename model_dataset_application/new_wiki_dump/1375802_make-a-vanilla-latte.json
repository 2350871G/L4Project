  "text":" Using an Espresso Machine Brew 2 ounces (30 milliliters) of espresso according to the directions on your espresso machine. Most machines will need some time heat up first. You will also want to tamp the filter basket to eliminate any air pockets. For the best taste, grind the coffee beans just before you brew them. Pour the espresso into a large mug. You need the mug to be large enough to hold about 10 ounces (300 milliliters). This will give you enough room for the milk and foam. Stir in the vanilla syrup. How much vanilla you use is up to you. Start with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) if this is your first time making a latte, then add more as needed. Pour cold milk into a steaming pitcher and heat it to 145\u00b0F to 165\u00b0F (65\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C) using the steaming wand on your espresso machine. Place the steaming wand tip at the surface of the milk. Turn the dial counterclockwise to begin heating the milk. Use a food thermometer to gauge temperature. If you like your lattes extra hot, you can go up to 175\u00b0F (80\u00b0C). Don't go above 180\u00b0F (82\u00b0C) or it will scald you.

Be sure to wipe the steaming wand with a clean, damp cloth immediately after steaming milk. Pour the steamed milk into the cup, using a spoon to hold back the froth. Place a spoon inside the pitcher, with the edge resting right against the rim. Carefully pour the steamed milk into the espresso, using the spoon to hold back the foam.

Add some garnish, if desired, and serve. Add a sprinkle of some cinnamon or cocoa powder on top of the foam. For something sweeter and fancier, add a drizzle of caramel or chocolate syrup instead. Without Using an Espresso Machine Add 2 teaspoons (10 grams) of instant coffee or instant espresso into a large mug. If you don't like instant coffee or instant espresso, brew some espresso-blend coffee in your coffee maker instead. Use twice the amount of grinds you'd normally use. Pour \u00bc cup (60 milliliters) of boiling water into the mug, and stir. This will make 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of \"espresso.\" Stir in the vanilla syrup. How much vanilla you use is up to you. Start with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) if this is your first time making a latte, then add more as needed. Fill a jar with 6 ounces (180 milliliters) of milk. The jar needs to be large enough so that it's only halfway filled after you add the milk. You will need the extra space for the foam. Close the jar, and shake it for 30 to 60 seconds.

Work quickly, as the foam will dissolve fast. Add some garnish, if desired, and serve. Add a sprinkle of some cinnamon or cocoa powder on top of the foam. For something sweeter and fancier, add a drizzle of caramel or chocolate syrup instead. Making an Iced Latte Add 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of vanilla syrup into a 16-ounce (475 milliliter) glass. If you'd like a sweeter vanilla latte, use a little bit more syrup. If you'd like a less-sweet vanilla latte, use less vanilla syrup. Pour in 10 ounces (300 milliliters) of cold milk. Because you are making an iced latte, you do not need to steam the milk. Add 1\u00bd ounces (45 milliliters) of espresso into the glass. For a stronger iced latte, use 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of espresso. You can brew the espresso using an espresso machine. If you don't have an espresso machine, brew some extra strong coffee using a coffee maker, or an instant coffee. Stir well using a long-handled spoon. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the glass with the spoon so that the syrup mixes evenly into the latte. Add some ice. How much ice you use is up to you. If you like your iced lattes extra cold, fill the glass the rest of the way with ice. If you like your iced lattes lightly-iced, then add in only a few ice cubes. Top off with some whipped cream, if desired, and serve with a straw. For an extra fancy iced latte, drizzle some chocolate or caramel syrup on top.",
