If the plant isn't potted, then water it thoroughly with a garden hose until the water begins to pool on top of the soil instead of soaking in. If you have a potted plant, fill a bucket or sink with cold water and put the pot in the water for a couple of hours.

To ensure that your plant gets the right amount, always touch the soil and make sure it's dry before you water the plant. For a rough estimate of the moisture level, stick a finger down into the soil. If it feels dry, you may need to water more.

Different types of plants often need more or less of certain nutrients in order to thrive. By testing the soil, you'll be able to find out if your plant is getting the nutrients it needs.
