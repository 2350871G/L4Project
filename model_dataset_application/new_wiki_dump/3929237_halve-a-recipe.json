If you can't easily halve a recipe, consider baking a full portion and freezing half or giving some away. Keep in mind that it's easy to halve most cooking recipes. For example, a delicate souffle might not rise properly if you halve the ingredients, but it's easy to halve the ingredients for a batch of cookies."

Tip: If you struggle with figuring out how to halve ingredients, search for easy to print kitchen charts that show common conversions. For example, if a recipe calls for 4 cups (950 ml) of stock, 2 cups (250 g) of chicken, 1 carrot, and 1/2 cup (15 g) of fresh parsley, you'd use 2 cups (470 ml) of stock, 1 cup (125 g) of chicken, 1/2 of a carrot, and 1/4 cup (7.5 g) of fresh parsley."

Reducing the oven temperature could mean that the food wouldn't cook fast enough and could cause foodborne illness. Raising the oven temperature could cause the food to brown quickly or even burn. For example, if you're supposed to saut\u00e9 chopped onions over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, you'll still need to keep the heat at medium. The only time you might need to adjust the temperature is if you're using a glass baking dish instead of a metal one. In this case, reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees."

Begin checking the food halfway through the cooking time. It probably won't be done just yet, but check it every few minutes after this point. Keep in mind that if you're cutting the number of something, such as cookies or cupcakes, they'll still need to bake for the recommended time. For example, if you're baking brownies, begin checking them at 20 minutes instead of 40 minutes, especially if you don't adjust the pan size."

Then measure out half of the liquid egg to use in your recipe. Tip: Although the amount of egg will depend on the size of the egg, half of a large beaten egg is about 2 tablespoons (30 ml).

Figure out the volume of the dish the recipe recommends and then use a dish with half the volume. Using the right size pan will ensure that the food bakes properly. For example, if you want to halve a brownie recipe that's originally baked in a 9 in \u00d7 13 in (23 cm \u00d7 33 cm) pan, use an 8 in \u00d7 8 in (20 cm \u00d7 20 cm) pan instead.
