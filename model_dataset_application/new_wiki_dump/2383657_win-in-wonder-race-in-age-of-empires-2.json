If you can only put it near a forest, or a gold mine, that's okay, as long as it is near at least one resource. The main point of the Town Center is to create more villagers at a faster pace.

Because the wonder needs to be built as soon as possible, as the game goes on, upgrading becomes less and less effective. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/21\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/21\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\/aid2383657-v4-728px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

  "text":" General Advice Always be creating villagers. Not only should you be doing this during a conquest match, it is especially important that you do it in this mode, because the villagers are going to make up your entire population (with the exception of the scout cavalry). If at any moment that your town center(s) aren't creating villagers, you are not playing the game right. Learn how to develop your economy in a normal match. This is crucial in order to win. Conquest (normal) is generally the easiest and the most common mode to play. The ability to beat a hard computer 1 vs 1 will greatly improve your chances of winning in Wonder Race. You should follow the steps in that article for the Dark Age and the Feudal Age. Thus, this article will pick up with the Castle Age. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/52\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/52\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/aid2383657-v4-728px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nDuring the Feudal Age, you should build a blacksmith and a market.

It is this time that you should be searching for your various food sources, most importantly sheep and boars. However, since scouting is primarily used to know where and what your enemy has, you may disregard your scout during the Castle Age. You should still assign a hotkey to it, e.g. Ctrl-1, for later use (see step 2 of the below section). Castle Age Build a Town Center next to at least two different resources. Wood and gold are ideal - if you are lucky, you can build a Town Center next to both a gold and a stone mine, as well as a forest. All of these will be vital for the wonder. Watch for the terrain. A Town Center is one of those buildings that require flat land for the plot of land it takes up, and many land maps just simply don't have flat terrain all the time. In fact, you will find that the terrain pops up in otherwise ideal places to put your Town Center. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/83\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/83\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\/aid2383657-v4-728px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nAdditionally, don't waste too much time searching for a place to put your Town Center. If you can only put it near a forest, or a gold mine, that's okay, as long as it is near at least one resource. The main point of the Town Center is to create more villagers at a faster pace. Placing it near resources just makes it more efficient for the villagers that deposit their resources at the Town Center. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6d\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-4Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-4Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6d\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-4Bullet2.jpg\\/aid2383657-v4-728px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-4Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nOnce your second Town Center has been built, build more Town Centers during the Castle Age - at least one more. Remember: you should always, always be creating more villagers! But also realize that it is not always wise to deplete all your food into villager creation. As long as a few villagers are in the queue, you are fine. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/70\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-4Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-4Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/70\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-4Bullet3.jpg\\/aid2383657-v4-728px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-4Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Build more houses. Houses are needed to support your villager population. If at any time you have reached your temporary population limit, you can kill your scout cavalry to make room for one more villager. This also allows more time for your villagers (preferably lumberjacks, never farmers) to build a few more houses. This is a one-time use. Research Heavy Plow, Bow Saw, Gold Mining, and Stone Mining, in that order. The technologies are found at the Mill, Lumber Camp, and Mining Camp, respectively. Heavy Plow makes your farms last longer. Bow Saw increases the lumberjacks' efficiency in cutting wood, and eases the reseeding queue a bit. If you have the resources and at least two mining camps, you can research Gold and Stone Mining at the same time. Gold and Stone Shaft Mining will be available to you in the Castle Age. Don't research them yet; allocate your resources elsewhere. When you have a lot of resources, you should research Gold Shaft Mining, and then Stone Shaft Mining. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/52\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/52\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/aid2383657-v4-728px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nAlso research Wheelbarrow in your first Town Center, if you have the resources. This is optional for now, but you should have it researched by the time you research Imperial Age.

Also build farms around your mill (unlike other modes, this is recommended as the villagers are safe). Have your villagers chop wood near your new Town Centers.

This is due to the idea of (at least nearly) having the required resources to build the wonder once you reach the Imperial Age. If you trade resources just to get the required resources for the Imperial Age research, then you will fall behind. The idea is similar to the Feudal Age.

Your villager population should be exceeding 80, ideally reaching 100. Roughly 30 should be on gold, 25 on wood, 20 on stone, and 25 on food. As food isn't one of the requirements for the wonder, you can create as many villagers as you would like to (not that many of them are going to be particularly useful). Don't upgrade. Since the objective one you get into the Imperial Age is to get 1000 of wood, gold, and stone, upgrading of any kind is discouraged. The point of upgrading is to provide a long-term advantage for your villagers. The villagers work more efficiently, but it does not easily provide a short-term solution to any resource shortage. Because the wonder needs to be built as soon as possible, as the game goes on, upgrading becomes less and less effective. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/21\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/21\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\/aid2383657-v4-728px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Build the wonder! Have as many of your villagers build the wonder. There is enough space so that about 40-50 villagers are able to build it simultaneously. If a bunch of villagers are just standing there, unable to find space where there is some, select them and click next to the place where there still is space. Your other villagers can do whatever they would like to. Double click any villager in the middle of your city to select the most villagers at once. There is nothing else to do other than wait for your villagers to complete the wonder and to hope that you build it first (in a close race)! {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7b\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7b\\/Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\\/aid2383657-v4-728px-Win-in-Wonder-Race-in-Age-of-Empires-2-Step-12Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":288,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"455\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}",
