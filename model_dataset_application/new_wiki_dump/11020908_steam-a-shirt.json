          "headline":"Place the shirt on a clothes hanger.",
          "description":"You can use a flocked hanger to prevent the shirt from sliding around, but a plastic hanger will work fine as well. Close up the top button of the shirt to prevent it from slipping off the hanger. If you\u2019re steaming a blouse or shirt without buttons, just pop it on a hanger. If there are any closures on the garment, such as a button at the center-back of a blouse neckline, close these up to keep the garment in place."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Hang the shirt up on a hook.",
          "description":"If you\u2019re using a standing steamer, hook the clothes hanger onto the built-in stand. If you don\u2019t have a stand, you can suspend the hanger from an over-the-door hook, a rolling garment rack, or a shower curtain ring. The goal is to keep the shirt upright and off of the floor. Note that the steam may affect the surface behind it. Only hang your shirt against surfaces that can withstand high heat and moisture. For instance, if you don\u2019t want to expose your wood door to moisture and heat, pick a different location like your glass shower door."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Fill the steamer with distilled or purified water up to the fill line.",
          "description":"Tap water contains minerals that will clog up the steamer and get deposited onto your clothes. Instead, boil a pot of tap water and allow it to cool down before adding it to the steamer. You can also choose to fill your steamer with pre-bottled distilled water. Pour the water into the base of a standing steamer, or the water canister on a handheld steamer. Don\u2019t fill the steamer beyond the fill line as you may cause an explosion of hot, steamy water. You can always add more water once you use up the supply."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Plug in and turn on the steamer to heat it up completely.",
          "description":"Some steamers will begin heating up immediately, but others will need to be turned on once plugged in. Make sure the steam head is upright when you turn it on, so that moisture doesn\u2019t pour out. For a standing steamer, you can hook the steam head onto the garment stand while it heats up. If you\u2019re using a handheld steamer, make sure it\u2019s standing upright on its base. If you\u2019re using a clasp attachment or a brush, clip on the steam head attachment prior to turning on the steamer. Allow the steamer to heat up completely before using it. Wait until you see steam emerging from the steamer. Or, if the steamer has a trigger, you might watch for a light that indicates when it\u2019s ready to use."

          "description":"For the best results, you\u2019ll start with the stiff, structural parts of the shirt. First will be the button placket (the left and right sides of the shirt where the buttons and corresponding buttonholes are located). With the mostly-unbuttoned shirt secured on the hanger, tug on the bottom or hem of one side of the placket to pull it taut."

          "headline":"Place the steam head on the inside of the button placket.",
          "description":"With the steam holes facing towards you, bring the steam head into contact with the fabric on one side of the placket. Continue holding the bottom of the placket taut. If you\u2019re using a clasp attachment, use it to grip the placket flat against the steam head."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Run the steamer along the inside of the placket in up and down strokes.",
          "description":"While still holding the placket taut and pressing the steam head gently against the inside of the fabric, engage the trigger so that the steam comes out (if your steamer has this type of control). Move the steam head slowly up and down along the full length of the placket until the creases relax. Depending on the fabric and how wrinkled it is, you\u2019ll probably need to run the steamer up and down each part of the garment about 2 to 8 times to completely smooth out the fabric. Repeat this process for the other side of the placket."

        {
          "headline":"Unbutton the cuffs and hold them open vertically to steam.",
          "description":"Since the steam moves directly upwards, you\u2019ll want to position the cuffs vertically so they catch as much steam as possible. Undo the cuff buttons and flatten out the cuffs. Hold each one vertically from the top. Drag the steam head up and down over the cuffs from the front and back until the fabric smooths out."

Hold up the shirt in this way, letting gravity keep the shirt collar vertical. Then, as you did for the button placket and cuffs, run the steamer up and down the collar fabric in a few passes to de-wrinkle it."

Bring the steam head in contact with the inside of the front of the shirt, since you\u2019ll be smoothing out the front first. If you\u2019re steaming from the outside, sometimes the force of the steam will push the garment away, even if you\u2019re trying to hold it taut. This is a trick used by professionals to quickly and effectively steam clothes."

Hold the hem of the shirt to keep the fabric taut and reposition your hand as you work across the width of the shirt. Engage the trigger to release the steam if your handheld steamer has one. You can go back over certain parts if you didn\u2019t get all the creases out in the first few passes. It could take around 2 to 8 passes for the fabric to relax. Even if you\u2019re trying to steam out a certain spot on the shirt, keep the steam head moving above and below that spot so that the steam can penetrate the fabric."

          "headline":"Flip the garment around on the hook to steam the back of the shirt.",

Slip the steam head back into the shirt with the holes facing you and pressing gently against the back of the shirt. Then draw it along the fabric in vertical motions, gradually working from one side to the other. To smooth out the yoke (the top panel going across the back of the shirt), try steaming first from the inside. If there are still some wrinkles remaining, guide the steam head along the outside of the yoke in short up and down motions, passing across the full width of the yoke to release creases from the seamed areas."

First draw the steamer slowly up and down along the back side of the sleeve, with the steam holes touching the fabric and facing towards you. Then bring the steamer to the front with the holes facing away from you as you work along the front side of the sleeve. Hold the sleeve at a 45-degree downward angle rather than straight out. Make sure there\u2019s no wrinkling in the armhole area since you could risk setting these creases into the sleeve."
