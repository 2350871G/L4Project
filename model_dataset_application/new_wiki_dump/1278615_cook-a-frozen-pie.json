          "description":"The foil will make cleanup easier if the filling bubbles over the sides. Never place a cold Pyrex or a glass pan directly into a hot oven. It can shatter. If you froze your pie in a glass dish, thaw the pie first to reduce the chance of shattering the dish. However, it\u2019s best to play it safe and use a disposable metal pie pan when baking a frozen pie. Some people suggest thawing the pie for about 25 minutes before you place it in the oven because it helps the pastry flour cook better."

          "description":"Alternatively, you could brush the top crust of the pie with cream or egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of water). Then, sprinkle it with sugar to add texture and color to the pie crust."

          "headline":"Place the pie on the bottom rack of the oven.",
          "description":"Baking frozen pies can be tricky because the top can get brown before the bottom cooks. Oven placement is essential for a frozen pie. Bake your pie on the lowest rack, which places the bottom of the pie closest to the heating element. You can move the pie lower and higher as it cooks as needed. One trick that may help if you have raw bottom crust is to preheat the baking sheet before you place the pie in the oven. Put the empty baking sheet into the oven as you preheat it. A preheated pizza stone will also work. Another tip is to place strips of foil around the edge of the pie. Keep the foil in place until the middle of the pie begins to brown, so that you stop the edges from over-browning. Or, you can \u201ctent\u201d a piece of foil over the top of the pie."

          "headline":"Bake the pie for 1 hour, rotating it after 30 minutes.",
          "description":"To start out, bake the pie at 425 \u00b0F (218 \u00b0C) for 15 minutes. Then, reduce the heat to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Continue baking the pie for another 45 minutes. After 30 minutes total cook time, rotate the pie 180 degrees to ensure it cooks evenly. The length of time you will have to bake the pie depends on how cold your freezer is, how hot the oven is, and the amount of filling in the pie. A good general rule is to bake the pie for 20-45 minutes longer than the recipe specifies for cooking normally. If you added foil around the edge of the pie, remove the foil edge pieces when the middle starts to brown. If the top of the pie starts to brown before the middle or bottom is cooked, make a tent with foil over the top of the pie."

If you hit hard chunks, put it back in the oven on a lower temperature. Shield the edges with foil again if necessary. When it\u2019s done, allow the pie to cool slightly before serving."

Every baker seems to have their particular tricks and tips, but there\u2019s really only one way to find out what works best for you. Luckily, you get to eat your mistakes\u2014and they\u2019ll still be pretty tasty! While some will argue in favor of it, most bakers seem to agree that it\u2019s best not to freeze a homemade fruit pie after baking it. Prepare it raw, then bake it from frozen. However, instead of assembling the pie before freezing, you may want to try freezing it in parts\u2014the prepared filling and the (unrolled) dough. In this case, you will let the components thaw to the point that they are workable."

You may also find that you need to reduce the temperature a little so that the edges don\u2019t burn before the center cooks through. For example, one pot pie recipe recommends baking unfrozen at 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) for about 30 minutes, and frozen at 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C)  for up to 45 minutes. If you\u2019re concerned about not getting good browning on the bottom crust, start out at the regular temperature for the first 15 minutes or so, then reduce it. If the edge crust is getting too brown before the center of the pie heats through, you can also try creating a ring-shaped heat shield out of aluminum foil, which you can (carefully) place over the edge of the pie. Use another pie dish as a template."
