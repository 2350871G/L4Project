Plant it early in the year for harvest before the summer heat wave, or after the hottest days of summer are past. Your area\u2019s climate will dictate whether or not you can grow Chinese cabbage. Grow it during periods where the temperature stays between 45\u00b0F and 75\u00b0F( 7\u2103 and 24\u2103). Whether you have a better chance in the spring or autumn depends on the area you live in.

If you live in a warmer climate, the cabbage needs to be planted where it will be in the shade for part of the day. Cabbage should never get more than eight hours of sunlight in a day. If your garden is in full sunlight for the entire day, you may need to build a shelter that will cover the cabbage for part of the day."

If you plant basil, celery, garlic, potatoes, rosemary, onions or beans, put your cabbage near them in the garden. These plants repel bugs and share nutrients.

It\u2019s best to do this for the whole garden, but it\u2019s especially important for Chinese cabbage seeds. At the beginning of the season, you may need to water the soil a few times over the course of a week to make it easier to till up. Cabbage grows well in sandy loam soil. It will grow if there is clay in the soil, as well, as long as the soil isn\u2019t all clay. If it is all clay, it probably won\u2019t drain well, which is important."

This vegetable needs soil high in organic matter, so the more compost the better. If you don\u2019t have a compost pile, find a garden store that sells composted organic material. Mix the compost into the soil after you turn the soil over. Make the mixture about 1:1 of garden soil and compost, at least in the areas where you\u2019re planting the cabbage."
