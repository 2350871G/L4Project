Use a paintbrush to pick up pea-sized amounts of adhesive and brush it onto the sections that you will be placing your gold leaf. If you have a lot of gold leaf areas, do 2 inches (5.1 cm) sections at a time so your adhesive doesn\u2019t dry before you get to it. You can find gold leaf adhesive at most craft supply stores."
