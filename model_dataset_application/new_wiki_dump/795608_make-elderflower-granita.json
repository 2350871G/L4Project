Drag a fork across the top of the frozen granita ice, dragging up flaking pieces of ice. Place the granita into a fresh container. It is ready for serving, or you can freeze it again until serving time. Elderflower, cucumber and rosemary granita Make a rosemary infusion. Bring 1/2 cup water to the boil.

Add the lemon or lime juice and stir to combine. Place into a suitable container for freezing. Add a cover and place in the freezer. After 2 hours, remove from the freezer and break up with a fork. This helps the ice crystals to form properly. Continue doing this every hour until the granita freezes properly. Serve. Scoop the granita into dessert bowls and serve.
