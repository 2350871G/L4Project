Teas picked earlier in the day (8am-10am) or later in the day (3pm-5pm) will have a weaker quality, but if they ripen during these times, that's when they must be plucked. People used to pick tea with fingers, but it's easier to do with clippers/shears. Here is a close-up of a tea plant. Methods in plucking vary by how many leaves you pluck with a bud.Imperial - the bud and first leaf to follow are taken. Fine - taking the bud and the two leaves that follow; produces the optimal quality of tea. Average - bud is taken with the first three leaves; allows the plant to grow better, but produces a lesser quality of tea."
