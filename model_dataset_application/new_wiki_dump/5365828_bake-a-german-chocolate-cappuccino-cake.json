  "text":" Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Place your oven racks in the upper and lower third of the oven. Grease three 8x2 inch (20x5cm) round baking pans, then line the bottoms of the pans with parchment paper or wax paper.  Melt the chocolate using a double boiler. Once melted, remove from heat and let the chocolate cool. Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl.  Combine the coffee and buttermilk in a small bowl.  Using an electric mixer, beat the butter until it is creamy. Add the sugar and continue beating until mixture is fluffy. Add the eggs, mixing well after adding each one. Add the vanilla extract and the melted chocolate, beating the mixture until everything is well-incorporated. Gradually add the coffee/buttermilk and the flour mixture to the butter mixture, beating until everything is mixed together.  Pour the batter evenly into your three pans, then bake for 30 to 35 minutes.  While the cake is baking, make your coffee-flavoured frosting.  When the cake is done, take it out of the oven and place it on a wire rack for 15 minutes to let it cool.  When the cake has cooled, frost each layer with the coffee frosting, then stack the layers one on top of the other.  Finished. ",
