Squeeze out as much moisture as possible. If too much excess remains, it can seep into the bread, causing it to turn soft and mushy."

The buttered side will need to be on the outside as the sandwich cooks, so when you assemble the sandwiches, the non-buttered side needs to face up. If you do not use wax paper, you may end up losing too much of the butter after you lift the sandwich up."
