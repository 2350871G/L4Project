You can pry loose the grilles in one of two ways:\nPoke a large, bent paperclip through each of the holes in the top row of ventilation spaces on the Xbox 360's casing, prying up each time. This will unhook the clips holding the grille. Insert a flathead screwdriver into the space where the grille meets the console case, then work the screwdriver around the grille, prying up as you go. This is less time-consuming than the above method, but runs the risk of breaking the clips that hold the grille in place. If you have a hard drive on your Xbox 360, first remove it."
