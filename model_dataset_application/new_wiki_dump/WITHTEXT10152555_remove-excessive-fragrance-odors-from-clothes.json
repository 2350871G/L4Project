          "headline":"Add 1  c (240 mL) of vinegar to your wash cycle to eliminate odors.",
          "description":"Use the vinegar in place of your laundry detergent to absorb unpleasant odors. Pour your vinegar directly onto your clothes after you put them in the washer, and rinse them 1-3 times until the smell is gone. For best results, use white distilled vinegar. Apple cider vinegar may stain clothes. You can use either hot or cold water. Both work well when washing with vinegar. It may take several washes for the smell to disappear."

          "headline":"Wash your delicate clothing by hand using Castile soap.",
          "description":"Simply pour 3-5 drops of the Castile soap onto the smelly area, and rinse it out with warm water. If you\u2019d like, you can gently scrub the spot with a soft-bristled brush, though this is not required. This is a great idea for bras or undershirts that may still smell like perfume. If you want to conserve water, wash your clothing in the shower."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use laundry booster to wash your clothes to get rid of stubborn smells.",
          "description":"Laundry booster is a washing additive that helps remove bacteria and smells from clothing. You can use either store bought brands or organic homemade soaps, such as Borax or baking soda. This is a great idea if you have tried other methods and your clothes still smell like residual perfume. If you use laundry booster in your wash, it can get rid of the stubborn perfume odor. If using a store bought variety, mix \u20442  c (120 mL) with your detergent, and wash your clothes in warm water. Read the list of suggested fabric on your laundry booster before you use it to wash delicate clothing. Most can be used on delicates, cottons, polyester, and wool. Do not use laundry booster to wash your leather clothing."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try using a scented laundry detergent to mask the smell.",
          "description":"While this may not remove the smell, it may make the perfume smell less noticeable. Use a scented detergent like lavender or a tropical blend to mask the smell. Check the garment tag of your individual items to determine the best water temperature and amount of detergent. If you are washing a small load of laundry, use half of a cap full of detergent. Many detergents are scented with plant-based aromas that work well to cover up the smell. If you are sensitive to chemicals, this may not be the best suggestion for you. If an item is hand-wash only, do not put it in the washing machine. Instead, wash your garment by hand using 1\u20132 US tbsp (15\u201330 mL) of scented detergent."

          "description":"Fresh air is a great way to get rid of smells trapped in your clothes. Pick a breezy spot outside in bright sunlight, and hang your clothing from a clothing line if possible. Leave your garment outside for 12 or more hours for best results. If you don\u2019t have a clothing line, drape your garment over an outdoor banister. You can also place it on a hanger and hang it from a deck or fence. In addition, if you place your clothing near leafy, green plants, they may help absorb some of the chemicals."

          "headline":"Apply a paste of baking soda and water to clean particular spots.",
          "description":"Baking soda works well to remove smells from particular spots on your clothing. Mix about 2 tbsp (29.6 g) of baking soda with a few drops of water until you have a smooth paste. Apply the paste to any smelly spot using a spoon, and let the baking soda dry completely for about 5 minutes. Then, remove away the baking soda with a stiff brush. Alternatively, put your garment in a plastic garbage bag, and pour in half a cup (118.3 g) of baking soda. Then, shake the bag thoroughly and let the garment sit for 10 minutes. Take your garment out of the bag and shake off any baking soda."

          "headline":"Scrub the smelly spot with diluted lemon juice if cleaning light clothing.",
          "description":"Mix equal parts of lemon juice and water in a spray bottle, and apply it to your clothing. Use a soft-bristled brush to scrub the areas, and hang your garment to dry. Then, check the smell. If the smell is gone, rinse out the lemon juice. If the garment still smells like perfume, try applying more lemon juice. Avoid this method if your clothing is brightly colored. The lemon juice may lighten the overall color of your garment."

          "headline":"Place the item inside a bag with coffee to remove the overall smell.",
          "description":"Coffee grounds are known to absorb unpleasant odors. To use, place your garment inside of a large brown paper bag, and pour in about 1 cup (236.6 g) of ground up coffee beans. Let the garment sit in the bag overnight. Then, take it out of the bag and shake off the ground. Your clothing may smell perfume-free after you take it out of the bag."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Spray diluted vodka on your clothing to remove the overpowering odor.",
          "description":"Use a bottle of inexpensive, high-proof vodka. Pour the vodka into a spray bottle so it is about two thirds of the way full, and fill up the rest with water from your faucet. Then, spray the mixture liberally over any smelly spot. Let the vodka sit on your garment for 5-10 minutes, then rinse it with cool water. Vodka may effectively kill bacteria and remove the perfume smell."
