Some places even offer a discount if you do this. Plastic water bottles are one of the best examples of how simple changes can create a big impact in your life. Not only is the water being sold not regulated as strictly as municipal drinking water sources, but the plastic mostly ends up in landfills.

Put a reminder on the fridge where you you keep your shopping list, on on the bathroom mirror, or any other place where you will see the note everyday. It doesn't need to be long or elegant or poetic. It just needs to say something like, \"No plastic bottles of water today\u2014remember your water bottle,\" or \"Bring your water bottle.\" The biggest part of the plastic bottled water problem is convenience."
