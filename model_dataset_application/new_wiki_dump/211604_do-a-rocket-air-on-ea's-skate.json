      "description":"The Rocket Air requires a lot of time to pull off, so you'll want to make sure you get some good air before you attempt it. You can do a Rocket Air off of a vert or by doing an ollie (jump) over a gap. To do an ollie, pull the stick towards you to crouch, and then flip it up when you want to ollie. Hold your crouch longer while going down a slope to get more air."

If you want to increase your points, you can use the left stick to spin around while you're in the air. Be careful when doing this though, as it makes landing much trickier."
