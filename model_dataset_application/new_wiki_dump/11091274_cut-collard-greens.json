This cut will produce ribbon-like greens that are long and thin. Some people like very thin ribbons, which will cook up faster and softer than larger, bite-sized chunks. Check your recipe if you are unsure which to use for you case. This method, called chiffonade, is also used for cutting fresh herbs like basil.

A quick and easy way to chop several leaves at once is to stack 6-8 leaves and roughly chop them into 1 inch (2.5 cm) bites. A small kitchen knife will not work for this method because the leaves tend to be so big. Choose a standard chef's knife with at least an 8 inches (20 cm) blade for the best and easiest results."
