However, it\u2019s easy to buy way more stuff than you actually need. Before you make a purchase, consider if you actually need that item or if it\u2019s just something that would be nice to have. For instance, you need a winter coat to stay warm. It\u2019s totally fine to pick a stylish coat that makes you feel great! However, you likely don\u2019t need 5 different coats so you can change up your look every day."

If you can, purchase these items second-hand to help you be a more mindful consumer. Don\u2019t buy items that you don\u2019t need, even if they\u2019re second-hand. Someone else might really need that item, so leave it for them to find."

These foods are typically grown seasonally and in their native environment. Additionally, buying items from local stores also supports your community and helps small businesses thrive. Here are some ways to shop locally:\nGo to farmer\u2019s markets. Buy from local artisans. Go to local businesses."

          "description":"Both plastic and paper shopping bags use the earth's resources, so it's best to avoid them if you can. Always bring reusable shopping bags when you're out shopping. Additionally, keep a bag or 2 in your car for impromptu shopping trips so that you're never without a bag. Some stores offer you a discount if you bring your own bag. Ask the clerk if you're eligible for a discount when you check out.Tip: You can also purchase reusable produce bags so you don't have to use the plastic bags that the store provides. Look for these bags online if you want to further reduce the waste that you create."

          "description":"The packaging that your products come in instantly becomes waste after you open the item. When you're buying something new, compare the amount of packaging on your different options. Then, choose the item that has the least amount of packaging. See if you can recycle the packaging after you open the item. For instance, cardboard or plastic packaging may be able to be recycled."

          "headline":"Look for fair-trade or eco-friendly labels on the products you buy.",
          "description":"Some products that are ethically sourced have labels to help you easily identify them. Typically, fair-trade means that the business paid fair prices to the producer of the goods. Eco-friendly means that the product was made in an environmentally sustainable way. Check products for these labels to help you make easy shopping decisions. For instance, you might find notebooks made from recycled materials that have an eco-friendly label. Similarly, you\u2019ll often see chocolate and coffee with a fair-trade label, which tells you the farmers were fairly paid for their cocoa or coffee beans. It\u2019s still important that you don\u2019t buy more than you need, even if items are fair-trade or eco-friendly.Tip: Keep in mind that items may still be ethically produced even if they don\u2019t have labels on them. If you\u2019ve researched an item and it seems like a good purchase, go ahead and purchase it."

Figure out how you will use it and if you already have an item that serves that purpose. Purchase the item only if you have a reason to get it. For instance, let\u2019s say you need a new pair of running shoes because your old shoes are worn out. In this case, you\u2019d have a purpose for buying the shoes.
