Not only will this save you money, homemade lunches are often healthier and lower in calories. If you have co-workers, get a group together. You can all agree to start packing your own lunches and eating together in the break room. This will make packing lunch a fun social event."

Most days of the week, prepare meals for yourself at home. If you're going out with friends, eat first so you won't be tempted to splurge on food later in the night."

Even if you're skipping the bars and staying in for drinks, a bottle of wine can cost a lot. Try to set aside one or two weekends per month for alcohol-free nights. For example, have a dry game or movie night. This way, you can have fun without spending a chunk of money on booze. Alcohol-free weekends allow you to go out without spending too much money.
