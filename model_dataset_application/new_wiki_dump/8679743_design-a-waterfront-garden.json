Grasses like sea oat and feather reed are both great for waterfront gardens. They add vibrant color and texture to the garden.

Daylily, lantana, yarrow, hydrangea, and gaillardia do well in salty soil. They come in a variety of shades, from yellows and reds to pinks and purples. If you are designing a waterfront garden by fresh water, try florals like angelica, basket of gold, bleeding heart, or calendula. Many of these florals also attract butterflies, an added bonus to any garden."

They tend to thrive well on their own in moist conditions. Plant perennials in pots so you can move them indoors during the winter months, especially if temperatures tend to drop by the water where you live."

Or you may try a warmer color palette, with yellows, reds, and oranges. Try to go for a softer palette for the garden so you do not overwhelm the calm, blue color of the water. A base palette of greens and yellows is popular in waterfront gardens. You can then add in colors like red, orange, purple, and pink to the palette to compliment the greens and yellows."

Putting tall grass by the water as a buffer will also prevent erosion. You can also put tall grass next to ground cover plants to add dimension and height to the garden."

Put them by tall grasses and ground cover plants like moss. Plant perennials in large decorative pots so you can place them in the garden by walkways or on a deck during the warmer months."

          "headline":"Add ground cover plants.",
          "description":"Ground cover plants like shrubs, moss, and vines can be added by pathways, decks, or walking stones. They also look good placed next to tall grass and florals. Often, the green tones of moss and vines are a good compliment to the yellow and browns of tall grasses. Be sure to include herbs like lavender or rosemary in the garden next to ground cover plants. If you plan to have a trellis in the waterfront garden, plant vines so they grow over the trellis."

          "headline":"Put in walking stones or a pathway.",
          "description":"A waterfront garden can be kicked up a notch with walking stones or a pathway. Use sandstone for walking stones, as it is a hardy material that can withstand salt and water. Gravel is also a good option for a pathway. Make the pathway so it leads to a spot by the water or around your home. You can also add a bench by the pathway or the walking stones. Get a bench made out of sandstone if it will be in the spot permanently. You can use a bench made of wood or metal if you plan to take it indoors during the cold months or during any storms by the water."

          "description":"Personalize the waterfront garden with decorative stones and garden ornaments. Large decorative stones can add texture and dimension to the garden. Place them among tall grasses and ground cover plants. You can find decorative stones at your local hardware store or find your own on the beach. Garden ornaments like driftwood, stone statues, and stone carvings can all add a personal touch to the waterfront garden. Scatter them among the plants for a detail oriented look."

Only water the roots of the plants, not the leaves, as this can lead to garden pests. Florals require regular watering and should be given water six inches into the soil once the soil becomes dry. Perennials and shrubs should be given water 12 inches into the soil once the soil becomes dry. Ornamental grasses do not require regular watering. They should be well watered when they are first planted and then only during periods of drought. Mosses also require little to no watering once they have been established in the garden."

Use garden shears to trim the shrubs and grasses when they start to become overgrown or crowd up the pathways. Waterfront gardens do look their best when they appear wild and carefree, so do not over trim or shape the grasses or shrubs. A simple trim every now and then will suffice."

This will allow them to survive indoors until the weather warms up again. If you live in a warm climate by the water year round with lots of sun, you may be fine to leave them outdoors in pots. Try to move them to spots with direct sunlight and avoid leaving them in shady areas."
