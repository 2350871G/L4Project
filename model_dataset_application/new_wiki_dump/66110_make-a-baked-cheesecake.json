For the best outcome, use a springform pan. This sort of pan is comprised of round cake pan with a removable bottom. It is all held together by a sprung collar."

To avoid any water leaking into your pan and ruining your crust, you will need to wrap the outside of the pan with hole-free aluminum foil. Place a piece of foil under the pan and then wrap it upwards and fold it so that the foil rests along the edge of the pan but doesn\u2019t fold over the lip. If needed, use a second piece of foil to cover any spots that the first piece missed."

Pour the mixture into the pan, then press the crust down with your hands, making sure that there are no holes. The result should be an even layer of crust that ever so slightly curves up along the edges of the pan.
