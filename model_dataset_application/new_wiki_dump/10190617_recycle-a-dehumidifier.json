Make a note to stop by during their trading hours and talk to the person in charge. They will either take your dehumidifier or give you more information on their recycling program with regards to any specific guidelines that they may have. Some places may require that the dehumidifier still works, and sometimes only accept specific models or sizes. Try going to a store that sells products of the same brand as your dehumidifier.

Depending on where you live, you might receive an amount between $15 to $25 for your dehumidifier. Some electricity companies also have their own recycling program.
