If you're in a place where the temperature dips to freezing temperatures during the winter, you're better off keeping it in the pot as a houseplant. Poinsettia are native to Mexico, and they need a warm climate to thrive."

          "description":"If you bought the poinsettia during the winter as a decoration, keep the plant in the pot until spring, even if you live in a place with mild winters. If it came in foil remove the wrapper so water can drain from the pot. It needs to stay potted until the weather gets warm enough to transplant it. Water it whenever the soil starts to dry out. At the beginning of spring, in March or April, cut the poinsettia back to about 8 inches. This will encourage it to begin a new growing cycle and get it ready for transplanting. Keep it watered and fertilize it once a month or so until early summer, when it's time for transplanting."

Move the poinsettias to an area where they receive total darkness for 14 to 16 hours a day in late September or early October. A cool closet is the best location, but if one is not available, you can also put the plants into a large box for their uninterrupted dark hours. Any light exposure during this time will delay the color change. Keep the plants in total darkness at the time when temperatures are coolest.
