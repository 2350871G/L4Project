Whisk the ingredients together until they\u2019re fully blended and the batter is smooth. You can purchase tapioca flour starch at most grocery stores. If you prefer, you can substitute whole wheat flour for the tapioca flour starch. You can find coconut flour at many grocery stores in the gluten-free foods section. Flaxseed meal is just ground flaxseeds. You can purchase the meal at many grocery and health food stores, or make your own by grinding whole flaxseeds in a food processor or coffee grinder."

You don\u2019t want it to thicken up too much or you won\u2019t be able to pour it into the pan to fry the tortillas."

You don\u2019t want it to thicken up too much or you won\u2019t be able to pour it into the pan to fry the tortillas. Forming the Tortillas Heat a skillet. To fry the tortillas, you\u2019ll need an 8-inch (20-cm) frying pan. Place it on the stove, and turn the heat to medium. Allow it to fully heat, which should take 3 to 5 minutes, before frying your tortillas.

Tilt the pan to spread the batter into a circle. As soon as you pour the batter into the center of the skillet, rotate your wrist to smoothly to tilt the pan and move the batter. The goal is to spread it so it covers the entire bottom of the pan. The batter should spread in a fairly thin, even layer throughout the pan. Frying the Tortillas Cook the tortilla until the edges begin to curl. Once the batter is spread throughout the pan, allow it to cook on medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes until the tortilla is just set. You\u2019ll know that it\u2019s set when the edges of the tortilla begin to lift and curl. Flip the tortilla and cook until the other side browns. When the bottom of the tortilla is set, use a rubber spatula to carefully flip it over. Allow it to cook on the other side until it is golden brown, which should take 2 to 3 minutes.
