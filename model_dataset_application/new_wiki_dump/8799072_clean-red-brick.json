Go over the entire surface of the brick with the nozzle of the vacuum, making sure you get into all the nooks and crannies. You can try out different settings, but you\u2019ll probably need to use the highest one to effectively remove most of the dirt. For interior red brick flooring, you can use a standard floor vacuum if you wish. Turn off the brush roll to protect your flooring, however. If you choose to sweep your brick floor with a broom, take care that crumbs and debris don\u2019t get stuck in the rough grout."

Use a clean, damp cloth to apply the paste to the red brick and let it sit for 15 minutes, or until dry. You can also use a mixture of salt and dish soap or borax and warm water. Once the paste has dried, remove the remnants with a nylon brush or another hard-bristled brush. If there is any remaining soot or dirt, try applying a bit of vinegar with a wet rag and wiping it clean."

Apply a generous covering of the bleach mixture directly to the red brick and let it sit overnight. Then you can rinse off the bleach mixture with a hose.
