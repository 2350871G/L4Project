Your best bet at building a good circle of online friends is to separate yourself from these jerks by behaving like a class act while you play. The best way to do this is simply to follow the Golden Rule: treat others the way you'd want them to treat you! Below, you'll find tips for what to do and what not to do on Xbox Live. Keep in mind that all of these suggestions are just specific applications of the Golden Rule."

The quality of the in-game conversation can determine the enjoyment of the game for everyone playing, so do your best to keep things lighthearted and fun so that everyone can enjoy themselves. Think: would you be likely to accept a friend request from someone who went out of his way to start an argument during a game? Probably not. Good conversation topics:\nFunny stories and jokes\nStrategies for the game being played\nGaming in general\nPop culture (movies, music, etc.) Casual, good-natured trash-talking\nBad conversation topics:\nControversial political issues\nRacial and religious issues\nMorbid/obscene stories\nBashing the worst player in the game"

Being a competent player marks you as a valuable person to have in the game \u2014 people on your team will want you on their team again and people playing against you will (usually) respect your ability. This doesn't mean that you should stress out about having a perfect record. In fact, having a loss-free record can be a sign of a cheater \u2014 almost everyone loses some games. On the other hand, if it's obvious after a few games that you're not a great player, simply make an effort to improve over time \u2014 wise players will respect that you're trying your best."

Instead, make an effort to help them learn from their mistakes. Though they may not improve immediately, you're helping a new player get enjoyment out of the game (and, if this player is on your team, improving your chances for winning!) Making fun of this player helps no one. One common way that new players get bashed in online games is as follows: an unskilled player joins a game and immediately makes a few rookie mistakes or gets herself killed. The other players on her team, now at a disadvantage, complain to everyone in the game that they have a noob on their team and can't possibly win. Especially sore losers may even \"rage quit\" the game in disgust. Don't be like this. Getting partnered with players who aren't very good is part of the online gaming experience. Make the best of a bad situation by helping this player get better."

This doesn't mean that losing has to be a humiliating experience or that winning has to be an opportunity to rub your success in your opponent's face. Xbox Live players who want to get friends should make a habit of being polite and dignified no matter how well or poorly they do. This doesn't mean you can't celebrate a win or complain about a loss \u2014 just that you shouldn't be a jerk about it! If you win, do:\n\nOffer your opponents a friendly \"good game,\" compliment any good plays they made. Don't:\nGloat about how great you played, tell your opponents that they played like amateurs, spend lots of time breaking down every mistake your opponents made. If you lose, do:\n\nOffer your opponents a friendly \"good game,\" compliment any good plays they made.

When in doubt, remember the old saying: \"Never argue with a fool. From a distance, you can't tell who's who.\" It's also worth noting that retaliating against an annoying player can be considered a breach of XBox Live's code of conduct. If a player is being so rude or troublesome that it's impossible to enjoy the game, simply leave and encourage other players to do the same. If no one will play with the abusive player, he can't enjoy the game, so he loses. You may also want to report this player if he was breaking the code of conduct.

Unless you're actually participating in a pro gaming competition, whether you win or lose won't affect you personally in any way unless you let it.

It may seem like it goes without saying, but if you're looking to make friends, don't be like this. Most serious players hate trolls (especially when they're in a game with one.)
