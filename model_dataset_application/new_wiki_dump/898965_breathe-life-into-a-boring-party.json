There are many kinds of games to choose from, or you can make up your own! Either way they are sure to break the ice and bring on the laughs. If no one at the party knows a game off hand, create your own by turning on a movie or TV show and taking a sip whenever the main character says a particular word. Or, designate a certain word or phrase commonly used to be off limits. Anyone who says the word or phrase has to take a sip. If you have a deck of cards the possibilities are endless. Try piling the cards face down in the middle of your guests to draw from. Have your guests help create a rule for each card. For instance, drawing a King means that person gets to decide how many sips the guest to their left has to take, drawing a 2 means the person who drew the card has take two sips, etc. Get creative with the rules and have fun!"
