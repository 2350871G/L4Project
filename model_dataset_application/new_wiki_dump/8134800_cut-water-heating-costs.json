          "description":"20 minutes of shower time per day - a conservative estimate for many multi-person households - can add up to 700 gallons of water a week. To frame that in terms of conservation, that\u2019s the equivalent of three years worth drinking water for one person. It will also lead to considerable hot water heating costs, which will vary based on your location. Keep showers to five minutes maximum. Two or three minutes should be plenty to wash up. Short showers will use much less water than baths. If you do take a bath, only fill it up as much as is necessary to wash. Taking cooler showers will also save you water heating costs, though water cost and conservation are important to be aware of as well."

Dish washing machines use less water than hand-washing, if used efficiently. If you are washing dishes by hand, fill a washtub with soapy water instead of letting the faucet run.

This is an inefficient process that leads to considerable costs, but there are a few steps you can take to improve your water heater\u2019s efficiency. For instance, you will save 3-5% on your water heating costs for every 10\u00b0F (12\u00b0C) reduction in the tank\u2019s standing water temperature. Since water heaters are usually set to 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C), you\u2019ll likely be saving a good amount just be taking this step. Don\u2019t trust the heater\u2019s thermostat.
