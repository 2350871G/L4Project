After, run a cycle of water (without any grounds) to clean the machine. See our article on using a coffee maker for help. You can also make espresso, but you'll need an espresso machine for this. See our article on using one. Finally, you can try buying liquid coffee concentrate at your local specialty grocery store."

Once it's crushed, it does not take up very much space. Adding more ice will give you a slushier, more solid drink. Adding less ice will give you something a little more liquid (like a milkshake). If you're in doubt, you can always err on the \"less\" side and add more if it's not thick enough."
