          "description":"This is the easiest way to make sure you have enough food for the party. Ask each guest to bring a dish to the party, preferably something you can eat without utensils and that won\u2019t need refrigerating. Prepare a main dish yourself, as the host, and ask guests to bring sides, additional main dishes, and/or desserts. Make suggestions of dishes your guests can bring so that they\u2019re less likely to all bring the same thing."

Ask your guests for preferences on food, and if appropriate, consider asking them if they can pitch in for the cost. Pizza is a classic choice, since you don\u2019t need cutlery and cleanup is relatively simple."

          "description":"If you\u2019ve got the time and energy, prepare some food beforehand and bring it to the beach. Fruit is a simple, refreshing option; simply slice it up in advance, pack it up, and bring it along. Finger foods are another great option for bringing to the beach, whether it\u2019s fried chicken, skewers or wraps. You can also bring a barbecue and grill burgers or hot dogs at the beach."

          "headline":"Provide a variety of alcohol.",
          "description":"Tastes differ, and not everyone likes the same beverage. You can ask your guests what they like ahead of time to help you plan ahead. Otherwise, bring beer, chilled wine and at least one cocktail option. Your best bet for a cocktail is punch or sangria. They\u2019re generally well-liked options and can be made in large batches. Recommend that guests bring their own alcohol if they have specific tastes and are willing to share."

Make sure you have plenty of water available, ideally bottled. Other non-alcoholic summer drinks include iced tea, lemonade, fruit juice and punches."

Send out an email or a message on social media asking your guests to let you know what they can\u2019t eat. Encourage them to bring things that they can eat and share with other guests."

Bring all of your perishable foods in quality coolers filled with ice or freezer packs. Keep drinks and snacks in coolers out for everyone to enjoy and keep meats, cheeses, and other perishable ingredients in other coolers that are kept away from guests. This way, the meat and cheese won\u2019t spoil as a result of the cooler being opened frequently."

Make sure you have:\n2 pounds of ice (907 g) per person. Enough alcohol for each person to have 3-4 drinks every 2-3 hours. 1 pint (473 mL) of dip and 1 pound (453 g) of chips for every 10 guests. 1 handful of salad per person. 5 ounces (142 g) of boneless meat and 12-16 ounces (340-453g) of bone-in meat per person. 4-5 ounces (113-142g) per person for every vegetable or potato side dish. 2-3 ounces (57-85g) per person for each side dish of rice, beans, or pasta. 1 slice of pie or cake per person. 5 ounces (142g) of ice cream per person. 2-3 cookies per person."

This way, guests can just get in line, grab a plate and some utensils, and take whatever they\u2019d like to eat. Make sure to have the plates and utensils located at the start of the line."

Look for a beach that\u2019s large enough to accommodate all your guests and has clean water to swim in. Check to make sure the beach you choose has no rules against late parties, alcohol, or bonfires.

Start by making a list of your favorite friends and family members and then either narrow it down or build it up from there depending on the head count and the vibe you\u2019re going for. Are you looking to blare the music and having an all-day dance party on the beach with 50 people or more? Or would you rather have a low-key intimate inner-circle party of only 10? Consider what you want the party to be like and make a guest list of people who fit that. Also be sure to invite guests that will enjoy interacting with each other. Don\u2019t invite two of your friends who broke off their engagement last year and haven\u2019t spoken to each other since."

Include activities that less athletic guests can have fun with as well, such as water gun fights, karaoke or sandcastle building. Whatever activities you choose, plan them at specific times.

Have a mix of classic summer tunes as well as popular songs from the current year. Ask for suggestions from your guests if you\u2019re coming up short on music ideas. Make sure you have a device that can play the music while at the beach. Use a battery-operated device that has a long battery life.

Since you\u2019re having the party at the beach, consider getting beach-themed decorations, such as tiki torches, leis for the guests to wear, and paper umbrellas for the guests to put in their drinks. This is an inexpensive way to add a touch of fun to your party."

For guests who\u2019ve had their fill, this gives them the chance to make a graceful exit.

Then, drop the trash bags into a nearby public dumpster or take them to a dump on your way home. Politely ask some of your lingering guests for their help. The job will get done faster when more people are contributing. If you have a smaller party, you can probably just put the trash in a trashcan by the beach\u2019s public restrooms and showers."
