If you want to make more plastic or do this experiment more than once, you will need more milk and vinegar. Whole milk or heavy cream will work better than 1% or 2% milk. An old T-shirt will work fine as the cotton cloth. You will be working with hot liquid so adult supervision is recommended."

          "description":"Measure out 1 cup (240 ml) of milk. This experiment can be done using either the microwave or heating the milk on the stove. Use a microwave-safe container if using the microwave. Pour the milk into a cookpot if using the stove. Heat the milk until it is just under boiling. If you have a candy thermometer, make sure the temperature is at least 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C). Stir the milk continuously if heating on the stove. Have an adult help you with this step. To microwave milk, put your microwave on 50% power for about 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, microwave in 30 second increments until the milk is hot."

          "description":"While the milk is still hot, add all of the vinegar to the container and stir for about 1 minute. As you stir, you should notice that clumps will start to form. If no clumps form, the milk was probably not hot enough for the reaction to occur. Try again with hotter milk. The milk curdles due to a change in its pH. The vinegar contains acetic acid, which makes the milk more acidic and causes the protein, called casein, to unfold and reorganize into a long chain."

If you\u2019re using a mesh strainer, simply place the strainer on top of the bowl. Let the milk cool for a bit and then pour it over the strainer and let it drain.
