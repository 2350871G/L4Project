          "description":"The size of the root system and bush will depend on the species of rose that you\u2019re growing. A quick search of the rose type online will tell you how large the bush might get. They can range in size from 1 foot (0.30 m) mini bushes to very large climbers that can easily cover a building. Roses can grow in many different climates as long as they receive ample sunlight throughout the day. Roses require full sun, or 6 hours of direct sunlight. Amend the soil with compost or sand before planting rose bushes so the soil is well-drained."

          "description":"During the first 1-2 years, water them often enough to keep the soil moist at all times. After that, water the plant with equal amounts of water 2-3 times per week. The soil should be dry at a depth of 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) before additional water is given."

          "headline":"Create a watering regimen for your roses once they are established.",
          "description":"Roses are thirsty plants that require regular irrigation from spring through fall and even throughout the winter in hot climates. The amount of water required by a rose bush depends on its size and the temperature. When daytime temperatures stay below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, give mini roses 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water each week. Medium-sized shrub roses need about 3 to 4 gallons (11 to 15 L) each week. Give large hybrid teas 6 gallons (23 L) each week. When daytime temperatures rise up to over 80 or 90 degrees Fahrenheit, double the number of gallons given to the rose each time."

          "headline":"Water the roses in the morning.",
          "description":"Before temperatures rise in the afternoon, water the plants thoroughly until the ground is moist. The roses will use the water throughout the day as it drains through the soil, and the water will have enough time to percolate without evaporating in the sun. If you live in a dry area, spread 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of shredded bark mulch around the roses to keep the soil moist and reduce the need for frequent irrigation."

          "headline":"Use an organic rose-friendly fertilizer.",
          "description":"Organic fertilizers commonly contain kelp meal, bone meal, chicken manure or alfalfa meal along with other ingredients. Select an organic fertilizer with a Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium (NPK) ratio of 5-7-2, 4-6-2 or an all-purpose 10-10-10 fertilizer. Nitrogen promotes foliage and Phosphorus promotes flowers. Potassium promotes overall health. Spray compost tea on the leaves and water the soil with it to encourage beneficial bacteria growth. This helps reduce fungus and pest problems."

          "headline":"Apply fertilizer in the springtime to ensure healthy plants.",
          "description":"Feed the roses for the first time in the spring when new foliage first appears. A springtime feeding will be adequate for most small and medium bushes, but larger bushes may need an additional round of fertilizer at the end of the spring bloom period. Do not give roses fertilizer after the middle of August as it will encourage new growth that may not mature in time for winter weather."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Give your rose the correct amount of fertilizer for its species.",
          "description":"The amount of fertilizer to give each rose varies, depending on the size of the rose and the fertilizer formulation. In general, apply about 0.5 to 1 cup (120 to 240 mL) per plant in an 18 in (46 cm) circle around the base of the plant. Be sure to follow the manufacturer\u2019s application instructions carefully. Make sure to water the soil before applying any fertilizer. The fertilizer can burn a rose\u2019s roots if the roots are dry. Work dry fertilizer into the top 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of soil before watering the rose."

The new stem will grow from the growth bud just below the pruning cut. After you prune your plant, wipe down your shears to prevent rust and store them in a cool, dry area."

For example, shrub roses and mini roses usually only need light pruning to shape them after they have been planted for two years. Cut back all of the stems on large roses, like hybrid teas, by about two-thirds every year. Be sure to remove any dead branches that have fallen or are rubbing against other, healthy branches throughout the year."

Seal stems that are thicker than a pencil with white household glue to keep insects out. This ensures that the stems will continue growing thicker and that there will be healthy, new foliage for the upcoming growing season."
