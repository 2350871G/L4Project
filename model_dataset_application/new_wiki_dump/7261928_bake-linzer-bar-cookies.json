Then take your butter and eggs out of the fridge and let them sit out on the counter so that they are warmer when making the dough. Room temperature ingredients are much easier to mix, however if you are trying to save time you do not need your eggs and butter to sit out."

Place the bottom chunk of dough onto the cutting board and completely cover all sides of the dough in a light layer of flour. Use the palms of your hands to press down on the dough and spread it out into a large rectangular shape, being careful not to create any tears in the dough. While you're pressing the dough down, flip it over 3 times and continue flouring the board and both sides of the dough as you do this. Then cover your rolling pin in a layer of flour and roll the dough until about 1/4\" thick, creating a rectangle as close to the size of your cookie sheet as you can. Throughout this step, remember to continue to add flour as the dough spreads out to keep it from sticking - if you forget to add flour the dough will become too sticky and be ruined."

Use your hands to press into the middle of the dough and slightly push it out, causing the edges to run up the sides of the cookie sheet a little and create a crust.

Cut at a steep angle and in a very slight jerking motion to keep the dough from sticking to the knife.

Try using part of the knife to hold and guide part of each strip while you lay it, and be careful to fully support it or else it will tear into pieces and become much harder to use.

Then take your butter and eggs out of the fridge and let them sit out on the counter so that they are warmer when making the dough. Room temperature ingredients are much easier to mix, however if you are trying to save time you do not need your eggs and butter to sit out. Zest an orange. Take one orange and zest the entire orange with a grater, putting the scrapings into a medium mixing bowl that will later become the bowl for wet ingredients. Grate the hazelnuts. Once your hazelnuts are chilled, you can either hand-grate them by using a knife to finely chop them up, or you can put them in a food processor for 30 seconds to 1 minute until they are a grainy flour.

In another medium mixing bowl, combine the cake flour, cinnamon, and grated hazelnuts, then use a fork to lightly mix the ingredients together. Mix the wet and dry ingredients together. Hand mix the wet and dry mixes into a smooth mass, but be careful not to knead the dough or over-mix them. As soon as all of the ingredients seem consistently mixed, stop.

Brush the top with a beaten egg. Once the dough lattice is laid out, take one raw egg and beat it until you have a solid yellow color. Brush the top of the lattice with the beaten egg using a food brush. Baking the Cookies Bake the cookies. Place the dough on the cookie sheet into the oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes or until the top is a dark golden brown. Do not remove the cookies from the oven early even if they look done - be sure to wait at least 40 minutes. If you end up over-cooking by 5-10 minutes it should not be an issue - they should still turn out great. Remove and let cool. These are best served warm and as dessert with things such as ice cream.",
