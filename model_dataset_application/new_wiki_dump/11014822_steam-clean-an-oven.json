The steam cleaning process will loosen up the more stubborn, caked-on grime. Be sure to wait until your oven is completely cool before starting to clean it. You can also use a vacuum with a hose attachment to suck up loose debris."

          "description":"If you have an oven with a steam cleaning setting, you can pour the water directly into the bottom of your oven. If you have an oven without a steam cleaning setting, on the other hand, fill an oven-safe pot or bowl, like a casserole dish, with water and put it on a rack in your oven. Refer to the owner\u2019s manual for specific instructions regarding how much water you should use when cleaning your oven with steam. Using distilled or filtered water instead of water from your tap will keep your oven free of water spots and mineral deposits.You can purchase distilled water at most grocery stores. If you\u2019re filling an oven-safe dish with water, you can also pour in \u20442 cup (120 mL) of vinegar for extra cleaning power. Or, if your oven is extremely dirty, you can use 1 cup (240 mL) of vinegar only."

If yours has such a button, refer to the owner\u2019s manual for model-specific instructions about how to use it. If your oven doesn\u2019t have a steam cleaning setting, heat it to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C) for 20 minutes. With some oven models with a separate steam clean setting, you may have to press the steam clean button first and then add water when the oven display prompts you to do so. For most ovens with a steam cleaning setting, the process will last anywhere from 20-30 minutes."

Let your oven cool down, and then use a sponge or dish rag to clean up any excess water or food particles. Use a rag or sponge that you don\u2019t mind getting stained. This step may get pretty messy, so be sure to put on some old clothes and keep a garbage can nearby. Make sure to clean any racks or pans that are in the oven as well."
