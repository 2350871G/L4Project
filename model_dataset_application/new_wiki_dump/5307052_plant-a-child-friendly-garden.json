Ask them what they'd like to plant in this area, and encourage them to help you plant the seeds or seedlings and care for the plants as they grow. Involving your kids in these decisions will get them invested in the plants. Then, when the fresh foods appear on the table, they know they had a hand in growing them, and they'll be more likely to eat them!"

Plus, it helps them learn about herbs used in cooking when you bring them into the kitchen and add them to your dishes and beverages. Try plants like spearmint, lavender, rosemary, basil, sage, parsley, cilantro, chives, and oregano. As an added bonus, herbs tend to be fairly hardy plants. Keep in mind that some herbs will take over whatever area you plant them in. Spearmint and lavender, for instance, tend to be aggressive."

You could also plant things to encourage other wildlife to visit, such as squirrels and chipmunks, and your kids will love watching these furry creatures.

For example, try perennial varieties of tulips, irises, lilies, black-eyed Susans, coneflowers, and lavender.
