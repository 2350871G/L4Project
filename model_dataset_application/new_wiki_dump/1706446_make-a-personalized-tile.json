Select coaster-sized ceramic tiles (about 4 inches by 4 inches (10.16 cm by 10.16 cm) featuring rough surfaces, such as travertine.

Select a decorative paper stock at your art supply store. Look for paper that matches your party theme. Purchase a clear craft glue. The glue should be viscous enough to brush onto a surface. Shop for pre-cut felt squares. This fabric will cover the back surface of each tile coaster to prevent furniture scratches. Purchase enough felt to adhere onto the backs of each tile square.

Using either soap and water or a paper towel soaked in alcohol, remove all dust and fingerprints from each tile. This ensures the image will adhere to the surface. Allow each tile to dry completely before proceeding. Decoupaging the Tiles Measure your image against the tile. Trim the image with scissors or a craft knife so that the paper edges are at least .25 inch (.635 cm) away from the tile's edges. Place a plastic sheet underneath the tiles you are working with. This prevents tiles from sticking to the table after you apply glue. Brush a generous amount of clear craft glue on top of one tile.  Center one sheet of your pre-cut image on the tile surface and hold in place. Press firmly on the paper with your thumbs, beginning in the center and working your way to the edges. Gently press air bubbles out by re-directing them to the outer edges of the paper. Work fast since craft glue dries rapidly. Ensure the edges are completely tacked down or the image will not adhere. Repeat this image transfer onto your other tiles. Allow the glue to dry at least 15 minutes. Brush 1 coat of craft glue over each image. Brushing in one direction only, paint around the edges and along the sides of the tile. Use the softest paintbrush you can find. Your brushstrokes will appear when the glue dries. Allow your top coat to dry. Add another layer, but paint it on using brush strokes in the opposite direction. This gives a textured appearance on the surface.
