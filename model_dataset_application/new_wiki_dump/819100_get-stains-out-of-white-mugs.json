Soak the mug for as long as it takes for the stains to disappear, anywhere between an hour to overnight. Alternatively, you can use a scrubbing sponge to scrub the mug until clean. This is the strength of bleach water used to sanitize dishes. If your stains don't come out, you can increase the strength of the bleach water but be sure that you wash the mug off very, very well afterwords."

These products are usually combined with a small amount of water and rubbed across the surface with a cloth or sponge. Be careful with these products, however, as they can be too abrasive and cause scratches. To avoid this, test the product on the underside of the mug before using it on the the rest of the item. You can also use a high quality stain remover, such as Oxi-Clean. Add the cleaner to a mug of hot water and let it soak until the stains disappear. Once they are gone, rinse the mug thoroughly."

The espresso machine cleaner is specially formulated to get at coffee stains in particular. Like all commercial cleaners, it is important to wash this cleaner off completely before using your mug again."
