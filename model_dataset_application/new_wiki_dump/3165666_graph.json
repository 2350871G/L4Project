For example, if you are measuring how changing the amount of water fed to a sunflower plant affects growth, you would control how much water you give each sunflower plant and measure each plant's growth after a fixed amount of time. Because the amount of water is controlled, the amount of water given each day would be recorded on the x-axis.

Polar Figure out how the graph works. A polar coordinate has two values: (r,\u03b8). r is the distance from the center to the point and \u03b8 is the angle between the terminal axis and the line connecting the center and the point. Understand the equation. r is dependent on \u03b8, meaning that as the equation goes around the center, the distance from the center r changes accordingly. A circle has the equation r=k, where k is a constant number. This is because no matter the value of theta, the equation is always a set distance from the center. As you may recall that is the definition of a circle; the set of all points equidistant from a single point. To convert polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, use the equations x=rcos\u03b8 and y=rsin\u03b8, giving the coordinate (rcos\u03b8, rsin\u03b8). ",
