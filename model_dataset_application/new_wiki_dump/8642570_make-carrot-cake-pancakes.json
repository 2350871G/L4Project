Carrot cake pancakes taste great when served with a cream cheese or maple cream cheese topping. If you want to make the topping, take these five minutes to prepare it. Frying the Pancakes Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0F (94\u00b0C). Move the rack to the upper third of the oven. As you fry the pancakes, you will place them into the oven. This will help keep them warm while you fry the rest. If you oven won't go that low, set it to the lowest temperature possible instead. Melt some butter in a cast-ion skillet.

As you finish frying each batch of pancakes, be sure to store them in the oven. Serve the pancakes. Once you have fried all of the pancakes, take them out of the oven and place them onto serving plates or a large platter. Serve them with a cream cheese topping or a maple cream cheese topping. Making a Cream Cheese Topping (Option 1) Beat the cream cheese. Place the cream cheese into a small mixing bowl. Beat it with a handheld mixer until it is smooth and fluffy. You can also use a whisk attachment on your food processor instead. Add in the powdered sugar, milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Start with 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of milk. You can add more later if the topping is too thick for you. Whisk everything together. Keep whisking until the mixture is smooth and there are no more streaks. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often so that nothing gets left behind. Adjust the consistency, if desired. If the topping is too thick for your liking, add the last tablespoon (15 milliliters) of milk. If it is not thick enough add in some more powdered sugar or cream cheese.
