  "text":" Making the Body Piece Make the body piece first. Lay down two full length fuzzy wires side by side, both in the same color. Twist the two fuzzy wires together from one end. Leave about one inch (2.5cm) at the top for the antenna (untwisted). Bend the untwisted ends into a V shape. This will form the antenna. The body piece is now ready for adding the wings to. Adding the Butterfly's Wings Make the upper wings first. Use one fuzzy wire for the first wing. Here you might wish to change to a different color from the body piece. Shape the fuzzy wire into a half circle shape. Attach it to the body piece by winding the ends around the body piece. Attach about one inch (2.5cm) from the top of the body piece and the other end in the middle of the body piece. This forms the top of the first wing. To attach, wind the ends around firmly about twice or three times. Use as little wire as possible for winding on, to allow most of the wire to serve as the wing. Repeat the same wing creation but on the exact opposite side. Wrap just underneath each of the attachment areas of the already added wing, using another piece of fuzzy wire in the same color. After adding this, you should have two top wing pieces firmly in place. When done, the whole piece should look like an oval. Make the bottom wings. Take another piece of fuzzy wire, either in the same color as the top wings or in a different but matching color. Make a half circle. This time, tie one end in the middle and the other end to near the base of the body piece. Repeat the same step just done for the other side of the bottom wing. Attach just under the attachment parts for the first bottom wing. When done, the whole thing should look like a figure eight. Decorating the Butterfly with Fuzzy Balls Glue fuzzy balls all down the twisted body of the butterfly.  Make the head from fuzzy balls. Glue two balls together. Ideally, these would be in the same color, to give a uniform impression of the head shape. Glue the head piece on about an inch (2.5cm) from the top of the body piece. Or, add it just under the antenna. Add googly eyes if you'd like, or just leave it as it is. Finished. Now it's time to enjoy your new butterfly creation.",
