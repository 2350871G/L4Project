Run the cloth over the surface of your floors to dust them and be sure to reach into the nooks and crannies where dust likes to hide. You can also use a dry mop with a microfiber head to pick up dust and grime. Disposable dusting cloths are quick and easy to use, and you can throw them away when you\u2019re finished. Look for disposable dusting cloths at department stores or online. Popular brands include Swiffer and Bona."
