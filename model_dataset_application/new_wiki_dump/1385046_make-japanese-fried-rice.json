          "description":"Rice generally requires a 2:1 water to rice ratio. The duration of cooking the rice depends on whether the rice is brown or white and long or short grain. Most rice cooking consists of boiling the water, adding the rice, then simmering without stirring for between 20-40 minutes, depending on the kind of rice. Consult the rice packaging for specific cooking instructions. Using jasmine rice can add a slightly more authentic flavor and texture to your homemade Japanese fried rice. If jasmine rice is not available, any long grain rice is preferred. Rice can also be made ahead of time in a slow cooker by combining boiling water and rice, then cooking on low for 3 hours."
