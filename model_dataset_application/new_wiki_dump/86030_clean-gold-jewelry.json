The carbonation in these liquids can help loosen accumulated dirt and debris. Don't use hot or boiling water, especially if your jewelry contains fragile precious stones. Some precious stones, like opals, can crack if subjected to rapid and drastic temperature changes. Similarly, don't use freezing cold water because the grime will contract and get tougher."

Stiff bristles can scratch the surface of your jewelry. If your jewelry is gold-plated (as opposed to solid gold), especially, stiff bristles can even remove the gold layer entirely! However, if there is any crevice that is not cleaning up, take a Q-Tip and rub it softly along the fissure. Special brushes designed for this purpose are best, but most small, soft brushes (like, for instance, eyebrow brushes) will also work."

Again, make sure the water isn't  hot , especially if your jewelry contains fragile stones. Don't let the water flow in a very powerful stream either as it pours a lot of strength on the jewel. If you're rinsing your jewelry in a sink, plug or cover the drain so that you don't accidentally lose your jewelry if it slips out of your hands.
