          "description":"If you have a large group of people and want a more competitive atmosphere, divide everyone up into teams. Having teams of at least 2 people each will add tension to the game and help get players more involved. To create teams have everybody hold up a number between 1 and 5 on their foreheads. The people who have the same numbers will be on a team together. Continue repeating the process until the teams are balanced and fully sorted."

This is where you will be placing the liquor, and where most of the attention will be focused on during the game. If you do not have a table, you can also lay out mats on a section of the floor and designate that as the castle area. You are going to need a large playable area like a living room or recreation room for this game. Make sure the table has enough space around it to later create the needed obstacle course zones."

The set of 20 beers will be your pawns that belong to the \u201cSoldiers of the Secret Order.\u201d These 4 lines of pawns represent the barriers between the 4 zones. Creating the perfect ratio between beers and players makes for an interesting game. Having 5 pawns per branch will easily support a game of 4 people. You can add more pawns to each of the branches if you have a large group of people playing."

          "description":"Utilize pillows, blankets, furniture, chairs, or sheets of paper to create the circular zone adjacent to the castle. You will need 20 household items to create the 4 zones. The floor in this game is lava, so choose items that are large enough for 1 or 2 people to stand on, and leave some distance between the spaces. The placement of each zone should be contained within the area outlined by two of the branches. The center space in each zone is the only place where you can retrieve a pawn, so these spaces need to be closest to the castle. Then have the beginning and ending spaces of the zones the furthest away from the castle. Repeat this process to create the 3 other zones around the table. When you are done, the setup should roughly resemble a flower that has 4 petals."

Within the show New Girl, the game evolved and the base rules became clearer over the seasons. When setting the rules with your friends, get creative and come up with mandatory sayings or points to hit within the game. For example, an additional rule can be that when someone finishes a beer, they ask, \"All trash belongs?\u201d Then the rest of the players would respond with, \u201cIn the junkyard!\u201d to which the player who finished the beer would throw out the can. This will help keep the playable area from becoming littered. The player in control can yell at any point, \u201cJFK,\u201d and everyone else will respond by yelling, \u201cFDR.\u201d Then everyone will have to finish a beer in hand. This can quickly eliminate players, and make a slow game move faster."

This can make a quick mess of your floors, so an alternative version would be just to chug a beer normally. Whoever finishes first, second, and so on, determines the order in which you and your friends will play the game. You can also use quick games of chance to determine who will have the first turn. This can be best accomplished by playing short rounds of rock-paper-scissors or by flipping a coin. Whoever wins will get to go first in the game."
