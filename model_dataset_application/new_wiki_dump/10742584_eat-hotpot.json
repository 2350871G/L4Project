Popular hotpot broths include:\nChicken broth: a basic broth that's great for beginners. Tom yum: a slightly sweet and spicy broth that goes well with meat. Ma-la: a Szechuan broth that's very spicy and has curry-like flavors. Savory mushroom: a good vegetarian broth that's rich in umami."

Chicken pieces are also available, but not as popular since they take much longer to cook. In addition to pieces of meat, you can also pick dumplings or balls made of meat, fish, or pork. There are a lot of meat and protein options, such as beef, pork belly, chicken, lamb shoulder, tofu, and offal."

If you prefer easier to eat seafood, choose pieces of haddock, seabass, squid, or eel. Shellfish, such as mussels, oysters, crab, and lobster, are also great options. If you get the head-on shrimp, you'll need to be careful as you eat it since very hot broth can become trapped in the shell."
