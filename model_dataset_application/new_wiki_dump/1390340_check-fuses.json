          "description":"Check for a metal box with a door; inside you\u2019ll see lots of glass fuses that screw into sockets. Typically, fuse boxes are located in basements, garages, laundry rooms, and attics.If you have trouble finding your fuse box, check the utility meter outside your home. Try to follow the wire that leads from the meter. Fuse boxes and circuit breakers are usually located near where power enters the house. Older homes have glass fuses that look like light bulbs. When fuses blow, they need to be replaced. Newer homes, on the other hand, have circuit breakers instead, which just need to be flipped and reset."

That way, they won\u2019t overload the replacement fuse when you turn on main power.If there\u2019s no main power switch, you should see a large block at the top of the panel. Pull it out and check for \u201cOn\u201d and \u201cOff labels. If it\u2019s labeled, reinsert it with the \u201cOff\u201d side facing up. If there\u2019s no label, set the block aside while you replace the blown fuse."

Twist that fuse counterclockwise, pull it out from the socket, and look inside the glass for black marks or a broken filament wire.If your fuse box is unlabeled, check each fuse individually for charred marks or broken filaments. Once you\u2019ve found the one that blew, label it! If you label your fuses every time you replace one, you\u2019ll eventually have a full diagram of the box."

Write down the number or take the blown fuse with you to the hardware store to ensure you get an identical match. Then, plug the replacement fuse in and turn it clockwise to lock it in place.Fuse ratings vary by country, but common amperages include 15, 20, and 30.Safety Warning: Never use a fuse with a higher amperage than the one that blew.

When you\u2019re ready, flip the main fuse switch or reinsert the main block to restore power to your home. Then test the circuit by checking the lights or plugging in your electronic devices.If your electronics still don\u2019t work after replacing the fuse, shut down main power and make sure the fuse is tightly connected. If the fuse blows again soon after you replaced it, you may be using more electrical devices than the circuit can handle. Try using fewer devices or unplug non-essential appliances when they\u2019re not in use. If you still can\u2019t find the problem, call an experienced electrician.

Press down with a little pressure until it pops into place. Car fuses are color-coded, so if the fuses are a different color, you know right away they aren\u2019t a match. Additionally, be sure the prong shape of the new fuse matches the old one. If necessary, ask an employee at the store for help finding the right replacement.Tip: If your car is disabled due to a blown fuse, you could swap out a matching fuse that controls a non-essential device.

Set the fuse glass-side-down on a non-conductive surface, such as a wood workbench or laminate counter, so the metal plug end faces up. Plug fuses, which are often found in home fuse boxes, have threaded terminals that look like the ends of standard light bulbs. To test it, touch one of the multimeter\u2019s probes to the very tip of the fuse\u2019s terminal. Touch the other probe to the side of the terminal near where the threading stops. If the multimeter displays a resistance between 0 and 5 \u03a9 (ohms), the fuse is good. A higher resistance means a degraded or potentially blown fuse, and a reading of OL (over limit) means the fuse is definitely blown. Like an automotive test light, using a multimeter to test a home plug fuse is a good solution if you suspect a blown fuse but can\u2019t find any clear visual signs."
