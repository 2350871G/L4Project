The Wildfire app is currently considered the best for wildfire warnings. Most standard weather apps like AccuWeather and the National Weather Service include emergency disaster alerts for your area. If you have one of these, you may already have all the warning you need for wildfires. In the US, the FEMA app provides warnings and also information on local shelters and emergency services. If your local news stations have apps, use these as well. They might provide the most up-to-date information on fires."

In the absence of other information, social media can give you some much-needed news. Some useful Twitter accounts to follow are @smokey_bear, the National Weather Service (@NWS), and the National Fire Protection Agency (@NFPA). These outlets all monitor wildfire activity. Try searching for hashtags like #wildfire for news from people closer to the fire. Remember that this isn't official information, though, so be careful about what you believe. There is a lot of misinformation in chaotic situations. If you're checking social media, conserve your phone or computer battery power. There may be a blackout, so keep these charged up."

For example, if you know there\u2019s a fire north of you and the wind is blowing south, it\u2019s blowing the fire in your direction. This puts you in the fire\u2019s path.
