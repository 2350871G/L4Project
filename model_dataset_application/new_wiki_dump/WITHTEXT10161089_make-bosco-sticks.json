Don't make the rectangle thicker than \u20444 inch (0.64 cm). The dough will rise and make it thicker.

It has a higher moisture content, so it won't hold its shape as well once baked. It'll make a gooey mess."

By the time you finish, the first batch should be almost done rising. The Bosco sticks will expand to nearly twice their size, so leave about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) between each one."

You want the temperature to gradually drop from 425 \u00b0F (218 \u00b0C) to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) while the Bosco sticks are in the oven. If you have a big enough oven, you may be able to fit both baking sheets side-by-side. If your oven is not big enough, save the second batch for later. Don't put the second baking sheet on a higher or lower rack. They won't bake evenly."

The Bosco sticks are ready when they turn puffy and golden brown. Repeat the process for the second batch. Remember to raise the temperature to 425 \u00b0F (218 \u00b0C) first, then drop it to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C)."

You can also use a pizza cutter instead, if you have one. Try to make the strips the same width. They should already all be the same height.
