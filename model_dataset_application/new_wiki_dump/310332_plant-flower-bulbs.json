Check your seed package for any other sunlight conditions your bulbs might have. If your bulbs need to be protected from the sun during the hottest part of the day, buy a garden shade structure to hang over your garden. You can also make your own garden shade by stringing a light-colored sheet up over your garden. Your bulbs will start blooming before new tree leaves grow in spring, so shady areas under trees can work just fine. Avoid areas shaded by your house or another building."

To figure out how well your soil drains, dig a hole that\u2019s about 12-18 in (30-35 cm) across and deep, then fill it with water. If it drains in 10 minutes or less, you have fast-draining soil.

To lower your pH level, use a pelletized sulfur product. You can mix the products into the top 6 inches (15 cm) of ground, or simply lay them on top and allow them to percolate down naturally. Bulbs are hardy and will grow well in nearly all types of soil. You shouldn\u2019t need to add any specific nutrients to your soil, although you can add a bit of compost as you cultivate the soil, especially if it's especially dry or sandy.

For a natural grouping effect, try tossing a handful of bulbs on the ground and planting them right where they fall.
