  "text":" A Basic Cardboard Wreath Find a piece of cardboard. White cardboard looks best if you have plain popcorn, or any color that matches the popcorn. Cut a circle out of the cardboard. Make it as large as you want the wreath to be. At a minimum, the circle must be bigger than the popcorn, including the space for the center hole. You can use any other shape you'd like, such as a heart, oval, square, star, and so forth. Cut a circle through the middle of the shape. If using another shape, cut the middle in that same shape. In each case, leave an edging on which the popcorn will be affixed. Don't make the edge portion too thin or too thick. If it's too thin, the popcorn won't have anything to affix to and the wreath may tear. If it's too thick, you'll be gluing on popcorn for ages. Start adding the popcorn. Using a hot glue gun, start gluing the popcorn to the wreath. This can be done either in row formation or randomly. Continue gluing on the popcorn until all of the cardboard wreath has been covered. Allow to completely dry. Attach string or ribbon in a loop formation to what is the top of the wreath. This will be used for hanging. If wished, you can also glue a bow onto the hanging piece. Hang in place. Choose somewhere that the wreath won't get wet or blown about too much; it's fragile and is best used indoors. A String Popcorn Wreath Select suitable thread for the base of the wreath. Use either very strong cotton or embroidery thread or monofilament thread. Measure the circle size for the wreath, then measure the thread to this length about three to five times, then cut to that length. A long piece is necessary to create a strong thread. If using monofilament, just use the first circle's length, as it'll be strong enough on its own, without doubling up. The color of the thread is completely up to you; it doesn't matter that much, unless you'd like to color coordinate it. Wrap the thread in to the length of the original circle, back and forth several times. This will double, triple or quadruple its strength. (Skip this step if using monofilament.) Star stringing. Thread a needle with the folded thread length and tie a knot at the end of the length. Push the needle through the middle of a piece of popcorn. Push it all the way along to the knotted end. Continue this method until you have added all of the popcorn you can fit onto the string, leaving a length for tying. Wrap the strung popcorn length around itself so it forms a ring. Tie it in place with a firm knot. The wreath is now complete and ready to hang indoors or out. A hanger can be attached to this wreath, as for Method 1's popcorn wreath.",
