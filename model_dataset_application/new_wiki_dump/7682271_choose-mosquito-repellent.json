          "description":"DEET stands for either N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide or N,N-diemethylbenzamideis. It is a reliable mosquito repellent that has been in use in the US since the late 1950s under brands like Cutter, Repeller, and Off! You can find DEET mosquito repellents at most outdoors, sporting goods, and hardware stores in lotion and spray forms. DEET can be highly effective. But be aware that these repellents come in different concentrations, from 5% to 100% DEET. Be aware that DEET\u2019s toxicity is still under study and be careful with it especially if you\u2019re using it on children. Some kids may have skin irritation and can also have harmful reactions if they accidentally swallow some. However, know that DEET repellents are still considered safe for children in low concentrations. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends levels of no more than 35% for kids."

          "headline":"Try a Picaridin alternative to DEET.",
          "description":"Picaridin was created by Bayer corporation in the 1980s as an alternative active ingredient to DEET and has been available in repellents in the US since 2005. It\u2019s as effective in keeping away mosquitos but lacks some of DEET\u2019s unpleasant qualities. Consider it if you\u2019re wary of DEET. Know that Picaridin is safe and as effective as DEET in similar concentrations. It is also odorless, non-oily on the skin, and will not cause skin irritation or melt plastics. Look for brands at the pharmacy or outdoors store like Cutter Advanced and Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Think about a Permethrin repellent.",
          "description":"Permethrin is another proven repellent. It has been used in agriculture, for lice in humans and animals, and as a repellent for mosquitos, ticks, and other insects. It can also last a long time. The thing that makes this product stand out, however, is that it\u2019s used on clothes rather than on skin. Be assured that Permethrin is fairly safe. While it causes skin irritation in some cases, the product is biodegradable in only a few weeks when it bonds to the soil or clothing. Permethrin is low in toxicity to birds and mammals. However, it is more toxic to insects, bees, and fish, so you\u2019ll need to avoid accidentally contaminating blooming crops and water with it."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Consider other plant-based repellents.",
          "description":"There are a number of mosquito repellents with other kinds of active ingredients, many derived from plants. You might want to consider these products if you are concerned about the possible side effects and toxicity of chemicals like DEET or Permethrin. You might try a repellent with oil of lemon eucalyptus, a synthetic form of the naturally occurring oil in eucalyptus leaves. This compound is as effective as 15%-20% concentrations of DEET. Don\u2019t use oil of lemon eucalyptus on children, as its safety hasn\u2019t been tested. Don\u2019t confuse it with the natural variety, either, lemon eucalyptus oil. This is a different product and hasn\u2019t been tested and approved as a repellent. Think about trying repellents that use citronella, lavender, sassafras, peppermint, or soy oils as active ingredients, too. These have all been tested and are moderately effective, though less than synthetic counterparts."

          "headline":"Choose Permethrin for the longest-lasting coverage.",
          "description":"Since Permethrin goes on your clothes and chemically bonds to the fabric, it is really long lasting and will stay active even after you wash the garments. It\u2019s probably the best choice for a lasting, low maintenance repellent. US military studies show that a low concentration of Permethrin on clothing (.5%) gave protection for up to 97.7% of bites. It can also last from 2 weeks to 6 months, or about 5-20 detergent washings. Look for pre-treated shirts, hats, and pants, if you are interested in using Permethrin. Brands like LL Bean and ExOfficio now offer such garments."

          "headline":"Go with higher DEET concentrations for longer coverage.",
          "description":"DEET is not only powerful stuff, but it can give you excellent coverage if you\u2019re going to be outdoors for a long period of time. In general, keep in mind that coverage will last longer with higher concentrations. DEET with about 50% concentration normally gives about 4 hours of protection, while increasing the level to 100% adds about one more hour. However, some brands with 100% DEET concentration can last up to 10 hours or more. Make sure to read any labels carefully to see what sort of concentration the product has. Lower levels of DEET (under 10%) will give you at most two hours of protection."

Naturally derived mosquito repellents usually aren\u2019t as effective and also don\u2019t last very long. You\u2019ll probably be OK with a natural active ingredient like citronella or peppermint oil if you\u2019re only outdoors for a short time \u2013 at most a few hours. For instance, Burt\u2019s Bees Herbal Insect Repellant uses rosemary oil, lemongrass oil, and citronella and works for up to 6 hours. This is pretty exceptional. More typical are products like Buzz Away Extreme, Badger Anti-Bug Balm, and All Terrain Herbal Armor, which use active ingredients like citronella and give protection from about 4 hours to as little as 20 minutes."

There are, in fact, plenty of candles that claim to do just this by using the repellent qualities of citronella. The thing is, they don\u2019t work very well. Citronella is moderately effective when you apply it to your skin. However, it is not always useful against mosquitos in candles. This may be because the smoke can change with wind direction and dissipates quickly. In one study, citronella candles reduced the number of bites only by a small amount \u2013 42.3% and 24.2%.
