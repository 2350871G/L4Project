  "text":" Baking Apples Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).  Wash the apples, cut off the tops, then remove the cores. Use a melon scoop or metal spoon to carve out the core; the hole should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. Be sure to leave the bottom \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) of the apples intact. Choose good baking apples, such as Golden Delicious, Jonagold, or Rome Beauty. Score the skin of the apples lightly. Use a sharp knife to draw a line around the apples, widthwise. Do this several times: near the top, around the middle, and towards the bottom. This will prevent the skin from breaking while the apple is baking. In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon. For fancier apples, you can also add some chopped pecans and/or chopped raisins. Distribute the sugar mixture evenly between the four apples. Each apple should get about 1 tablespoon of the mixture. Add some butter on top of the brown sugar. Cut the butter into four, equal-sized cubes, then drop each cube on top of each apple. When the butter melts, it will mix with the sugar, and give you a delicious sauce.

Take the apples out of the baking dish, and transfer them to a serving platter using a spatula. If you'd like, you can baste them with the juice collected at the bottom of the baking dish. Frying Apples Prepare the apples for frying. Wash and peel the apples first. Then, prepare them in one of the following ways:\nCore the apples, then cut them into rings/slices. Cut the apples into thin wedges. Cut the apples into quarters, then into \u00bd-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick slices. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.

If you don't want the \"sauce\" leftover from the apples, scoop them out using a slotted spoon instead. Microwaving Apples Cut off the tops of two apples, then scoop the cores out using a spoon or melon scoop. Try to make the holes about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. Leave about \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) of the bottom of the apples intact. In a bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. This will ensure that each apple gets an equal amount of spices. Spoon the sugar mixture into each apple. Each apple will get about 1 tablespoon of the sugar mixture.
