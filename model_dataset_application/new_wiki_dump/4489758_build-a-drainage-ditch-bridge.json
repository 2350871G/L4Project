      "headline":"Dig up the ground up to a foot (or more) where you marked the 4 corners.",

Try to dig at least 8\u201312 inches (20.3\u201330.5 cm) in the ground so that the posts are deep enough to be covered up with dirt. This part can be tricky, as the posts need to be level with each other, and the ground itself. They also need to be even. Measure across, sideways, and add dirt or dig more to get yourself to where you are exactly even, level, and secure."

Screw two deck screws on each side, and continue laying boards all the way across. Make sure you are even, level, and the boards are staying put. You may need to remove weeds, dig into the ground to place the first and last board if it cuts into the ground, doing away with large gaps from the ground to the bridge."
