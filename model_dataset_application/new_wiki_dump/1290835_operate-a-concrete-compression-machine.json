After making a complete table, turn on the machine. The main power switch is behind the digital monitor screen. Be careful not to touch the motor while it is on. Place the concrete cylinder in the center of the loading area. You must place the cylinder on top of the neoprene cap as shown in the image to the right. Be careful not to move the piston manually with your hands. Close and latch the cage door. Watch your hands! Push the lever away from you on the motor to lower the piston against the top of the concrete cylinder. Make sure the lever is in the \u201cAdvance\u201d position. Do not touch the motor. Please make sure the piston is touching the top of the cylinder before you proceed. Be careful not to put hands near piston while it is coming down! Once the piston is right on top of the cylinder, pull the lever towards you into the \u201cHold\u201d position.  Push the \u201czero\u201d button on the display to start the compression test.  Increase the amount of pressure on the piston by turning the valve next to the piston-lever counter-clockwise. Refer to Page 5 for correct pressures per concrete cylinder.
