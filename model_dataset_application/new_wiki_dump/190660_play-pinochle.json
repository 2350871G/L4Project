          "description":"Pinochle is most often played using a deck of 48 cards. These include two of the same cards of each suit in the ranking of \"nine\" to ace, which has the highest value in the game. The rules of the game will be the same whether you have 2, 3 or 4 players (though the number of decks required to accommodate each player will differ). Some simplified Pinochle decks only contain 24 cards, or one card of each ranking and suit. In order to play the game correctly, you\u2019ll need to use two complete decks. If you don't have access to a Pinochle deck, you can go through two standard decks and remove all the cards with unnecessary rankings."

          "description":"Pinochle is scored using an unusual ranking system. The ace is the most valuable card in the deck, worth 11 points for each \u201ctrick.\u201d Following the ace, \"tens\" are worth 10 points, kings are worth 4, queens are worth 3, and jacks are worth 2. \"Nine\" cards have no point value. A \"trick\" is a round of Pinochle in which each player plays a single card at a time. The basic idea behind the game is to put together combinations of cards in different suits and rankings to win the high score of a hand."

If there are only two players participating, the remaining cards should be placed in a stack face down on the table. Have the players count their cards to make sure they have the correct number before you begin. If you\u2019re playing in teams of two, be sure to sit directly across from your partner."

If the player or team can match their predicted score by the end of the game, they\u2019ll be awarded that score plus the points from each meld they successfully produce. After each round, the other players will be able to raise the bid in 10 point increments. The winning bid stands after three trick plays. If you\u2019re playing in teams, only two bids will be made\u2014one for each group."

This card indicates the \u201ctrump suit,\u201d and will determine which suit has the highest value during the hand. Otherwise, the player who won the bid will have the privilege of calling trump.

Melds are not actually played like tricks but held to increase the possible value of a player\u2019s hand. At the end of the game, the points you receive for melding will be added to your final score. For example, the highest scoring meld in pinochle is the \u201cflush,\u201d which consists of an ace, king, queen, jack and ten of the same suit. Other melds include \u201c60 queens,\u201d or one queen of each suit, which is worth 40 points, and \u201croyal marriage,\u201d a king and queen of the same suit, which will net you 40 points. Only one meld is allowed per turn; this means you couldn't be awarded points for both a flush and a royal marriage because they both contain the same cards.
