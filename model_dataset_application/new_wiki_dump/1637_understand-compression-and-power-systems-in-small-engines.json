The compression ratio is a comparison of the volume (with the piston at the bottom) and the space left with the piston at the top of its stroke. Most lawnmowers are low compression engines, with ratios of 8:1 or less. This is why they run well on cheap gas (87 octane)."

      "description":"The best indicator of low compression is the engine pulling through too easily. If you hit the starter and the engine spins like crazy (unusually fast), you will need to check the compression with a tester. This is a simple air gauge that screws into the spark plug hole and traps the air inside as the piston runs up and down. If you're getting less than 80 psi, you've got a problem. The most common causes are a blown head gasket, or a stuck or bent valve."
