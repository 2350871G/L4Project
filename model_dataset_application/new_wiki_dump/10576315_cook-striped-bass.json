Choose a skillet that\u2019s just large enough to fit the fish into (but don\u2019t add it yet).

Wait several minutes until the mixture is bubbling rapidly. You can stir the mixture occasionally, but it\u2019s not necessary. Add the striped bass and reduce the heat. Use tongs or a spatula to carefully place the striped bass filet flesh-side down into the boiling mixture. Then, turn down the heat on the burner until the liquid is only occasionally bubbling. Make sure you don\u2019t splatter the boiling liquid on yourself. Cook the bass 8-10 minutes, turning once or twice. Use tongs or a spatula to carefully flip the bass filet over every 4 minutes or so. A 1 in (2.5 cm) bass filet will typically cook through in 8 minutes. You\u2019ll know the fish is done when it\u2019s just gone from translucent to opaque at the edges and it flakes easily with a fork. Or, use a probe thermometer to check for an internal temperature of 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C). Serve the bass coated in the pan sauce. Remove the cooked bass from the pan and cut it into up to 4 individual servings. Plate each portion over a bed of cooked white rice (if desired), then pour some of the pan sauce over top. Add a few fresh scallion pieces on top as a garnish. Or, you can serve the entire filet family-style on a platter over a larger bed of rice.
