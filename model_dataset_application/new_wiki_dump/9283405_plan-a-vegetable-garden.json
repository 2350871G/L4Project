          "description":"New gardeners often make the mistake of planting more than they can handle. For your first season, choose up to three plants that you're adamant about putting in your garden. You can rotate out different plants between planting seasons. Check gardening catalogs, both print and online, if you struggle to think of a plant. Keep in mind that some plants will produce all season long while others will produce only one time. For example tomatoes, peppers, and squash will continue to produce all season long and they will produce very large yields. However, corn, carrots, and radishes will only produce once."

Choose increasingly difficult plants as your gardening experience increases. Beginner-friendly vegetable plants include: carrots, radishes, sugar or snap peas, beets, and lettuce."

          "description":"You don't have to find a plant that only grows in your location, but look for plants adapted to similar climates. If your city is hot and humid, for example, buy plants that love humidity (or vice-versa if you live in a desert). Tomatoes, for example, originated in South America but thrive in the similar climate of the Mediterranean. Avoid choosing rare or temperamental plants that will require more care than you can give."

          "description":"Vegetables are sorted into two major types: \"warm season\" and \"cool season.\" Warm season vegetables are planted and harvested from mid-spring to early summer, and cool season vegetables are planted and harvest from late summer to mid-autumn. Pick a variety compatible with the season to keep your plants healthy. Warm weather vegetables include: beans, cantaloupes, cucumbers, okras, peppers, peas, sweet corn, tomatoes, and watermelons. Cool weather vegetables include: beets, broccoli, cauliflower, onions, potatoes, radishes, and turnips."

Research every potential plant's growing process so you don't choose a plant larger than what you have room for. Never judge a plant by its seedling, as some begin deceivingly small. Vegetables ideal for small spaces are: tomatoes, lettuce, pole beans, chard, radishes, eggplants, avocados, lemons, and most herbs."

Depending on how much space you have available, choose how many of each plants you will grow. Make sure to leave enough space in your garden to walk around in it as well.

Avoid spots that are shaded by trees or your home during the afternoon. Check your plants' growing conditions for specific details on how much sun they need. If your only available spot for a garden does not get full sun, then you can also grow plants that only require partial sun, such as spinach and lettuce.

Fill the hole with water and observe how long it takes for the water to sink into the ground. Soils with better draining properties will lose water quickly. Ten minutes or less is the ideal. Any longer, and your soil may have poor drainage. You may also consider planting in a raised garden box to ensure good drainage."
