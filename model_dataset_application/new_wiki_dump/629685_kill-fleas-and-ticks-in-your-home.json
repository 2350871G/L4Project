Bathe your pets with a special shampoo that\u2019s designed to kill fleas and ticks:\nIn a bathtub, laundry tub, or outside, rinse your pet to get his fur wet. Apply the shampoo and massage it thoroughly into his fur. Let the shampoo sit (check the bottle for the specific amount of time). Rinse the shampoo out of your pet\u2019s fur."

To remove ticks:\nGrab tweezers and gloves. Put on the gloves. Locate the tick and use the tweezers to squeeze the tick. Be sure to grasp near its head, as close to your pet\u2019s skin as you can manage. Do not squeeze the tick near its belly. Hold on to the tick firmly with the tweezers and pull it straight out."
