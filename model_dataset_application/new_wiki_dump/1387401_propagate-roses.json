          "description":"Planting stem cuttings is one of the most popular ways to propagate roses. The best time to take and plant cuttings is when the temperature outside is warm but not too hot. Choose a time when the rose bush is undergoing strong growth. The ideal time of year for this is late spring or early summer. It is possible to grow roses from cuttings when the weather is colder, but the process will take longer and your chances of success will be lower. If you don\u2019t have a rose bush of your own that you can use for a cutting, ask a friend or neighbour if they have a plant you can use. You may also be able to find wild rose bushes that you can propagate. You can also ask a local nursery or garden center if they let people take cuttings from any of their plants."

This will increase air flow and draining, giving your cutting a better opportunity to root. If the soil is dry, water it and allow the excess water to drain out, so that the soil is evenly moist. Instead of a pot, you can also use a small mason jar or the bottom half of a large plastic bottle (cut the top off)."

          "headline":"Select a stem for the cutting.",
          "description":"Choose a healthy and established plant to take a cutting from. The stem should come from the top and side of the plant, and it should have at least three leaves on it. Ideally, find a stem that has flowered recently. Look for a stem that\u2019s young but established and hardy, and that\u2019s about six inches (15 cm) long. It\u2019s better to take cuttings from the top and side of the plant because they seem to root better than cuttings from the middle or bottom. It\u2019s ok if the stem you select has buds and flowers currently on it, but look for a stem with flowers that are starting to wither. This indicates the stem recently bloomed."

          "description":"The best tool for taking the cutting is a pair of sharp pruning shears or a razor blade. Cut the stem from the plant at a 45-degree angle, just below one of the lower leaf nodes (where the leaf attaches to the stem). Make sure the cutting tool has been sterilized to prevent the spread of disease. To sterilize your cutting tool, you can heat it with fire until it\u2019s red hot, or boil it in water for 30 minutes."

Cut off any leaves on the lower half of the stem. Leave two to three higher leaves to help with photosynthesis. Cut these leaves in half to reduce the loss of moisture."

With the same cutting tool, cut one-inch (2.5-cm) slits in the bark at the bottom of the stem. Make three or four slits in the bark to give the roots more places to grow out from."

Shake it gently to remove excess hormone. Rooting hormone is not a necessary step in the cutting and propagating process, but it will increase the chances that your cutting will grow successfully."

          "description":"To cover the stem with plastic, insert two eight-inch (20-cm) sticks or wires into the soil on either side of the stem to prop up the plastic. Cover the pot and stem with a clear plastic bag, and affix the bag to the pot with an elastic or twine. With a mason jar, simply place a large mason jar over the stem. Covering the stem with glass or plastic will create a miniature greenhouse, and the cover will help keep in the heat, moisture, and ultraviolet rays the stem needs to root and grow."

But to avoid overheating, place the plant in a bright location that receives lots of indirect sunlight, especially around midday. The mason jar or plastic will help to keep the soil and cutting moist, but add more water any time the cutting or soil starts to dry out. Placing a heating mat under the plant can help encourage the roots to grow."
