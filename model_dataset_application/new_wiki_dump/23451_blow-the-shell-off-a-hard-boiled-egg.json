Do this to an area about the size of a dime on the smaller end (18 mm diameter) and about the size of a nickel on the larger end (21 mm diameter). Roll the egg between your hands or on a hard surface to loosen the shell from the egg. This should produce small cracks throughout the shell. Hold the egg in your right hand. Keep the smaller end toward you. Form a circle with the thumb and index finger of your right hand that is about the same size as the opening on the smaller end of the egg. Be sure your thumb is over your index finger. Place the thumb/index finger circle over the opening on the small end. Place your left hand under and around your right hand, cupping the egg. Be sure that your fingers fit together and make a seal. This seal is key in directing all the air into the shell and not letting it escape around it. Bring your hands and the egg to your mouth, forming a seal between your lips and the circle formed with your right hand.  Take a deep breath and blow hard.
