          "description":"Make sure the meat you buy is at least USDA Choice grade or higher. Don\u2019t go for overly lean cuts, such as tenderloin, because they\u2019ll be less flavorful. Look for subprimal cuts, such as the ribeye or striploin. The USDA grade mark is displayed on the package if a cut of beef has been officially graded. Don't get beef without a grade mark for dry aging. Beef is the most commonly dry aged meat. It responds well to the tenderization of the process. In general, meats like lamb, pork, and veal are already tender enough without being dry aged."

          "description":"Don\u2019t dry-age an individual cut of steak. It will lose too much moisture in the process and shrink down to an inedible sliver. Get a sub-primal cut. This is a whole chunk of meat that hasn't been sliced into individual steaks yet. Try a large section of ribs, which come in several different forms and number designations, based on how much bone and meat is included. The 107 and the 109 are good options that you can find at a retail butcher or supermarket."

          "description":"Your cheapest option is a mini-fridge, which you can buy online for about $130. If you\u2019re a serious meat lover, consider getting a fridge specifically formulated for dry aging, with humidity and temperature control, a carbon filter, UV light, and glass door. These retail online for anywhere from $1,500 to $4,500. Don\u2019t use your kitchen fridge. The meat will absorb the lingering smells of other food. The pungent smell of dry-aging will also permeate your entire fridge."

          "description":"Even if your fridge is new, clean it before using it for the first time. Unplug the fridge and wipe it down with soapy water and a sponge. Rinse it out, then sponge it again with a solution of 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of chlorine bleach and 16 cups (3,800 mL) of water. Rinse away the cleaning solution, then let the fridge air out, unplugged with the door open, until any lingering chlorine smell is gone."

Get a standalone thermometer to monitor the temperature rather than relying on the temperature display of the fridge. You can find a standalone fridge thermometer online for about $15."

          "headline":"Maintain humidity in the fridge around 80%.",
          "description":"Measure the humidity level with a thermometer that displays humidity as well as temperature. Keeping your fridge stocked to capacity should naturally keep the humidity around 80%. The optimal zone is 75-85% humidity. If humidity is too high, the meat will spoil. If humidity is too low, the meat will dry too quickly. You can buy a thermometer with a humidity display online for about $40. If your humidity goes slightly above 85%, put a salt block measuring about 12 by 8 by 2 inches (30.5 by 20.3 by 5.1 cm) in your fridge. You can buy a giant salt block online for about $25."

Find a good starter piece of meat online or at a specialty butcher. If you can\u2019t find a piece of meat that\u2019s already been dry-aged, simply skip inoculating your fridge. Your dry aging will still be successful. Your meat just won\u2019t have quite the same funk produced by a mature dry aging facility."

          "description":"Get a small desk fan. Cut a little notch in the fridge door seal, just big enough to accommodate the cord of the fan. Snake the fan\u2019s cord through the hole. Turn the fan on, using a low setting if it has multiple airflow options. Place your fan on the bottom of the fridge and angle it up to the shelves."

Don\u2019t age your meat on a plate or the floor of the fridge. The underside of the meat won\u2019t dehydrate properly and will rot. Put a tray under the rack or fridge shelf to catch any drippings. Make sure the tray isn't touching the meat, though. Don\u2019t wrap the meat. Some dry-aging recipes advise you to wrap the meat in cheesecloth, paper towels, or kitchen towels to wick away moisture.

It takes 21 days before complex flavors begin developing. Signature dry age taste begins to develop around 30 days. Meat starts becoming truly funky aged between 28 and 45 days. By 45 days, your meat will be noticeably moister and juicier, with distinct aromas of blue cheese. Extremely intense flavors emerge between 45 and 60 days, that most tasters find overbearing after more than one or two bites. It\u2019s rare to find steaks aged 60 days or more served in restaurants."

Stop as soon as you see fresh-looking fat and meat. Remove all the dried-out outer layer until only red meat and clean white fat show.
