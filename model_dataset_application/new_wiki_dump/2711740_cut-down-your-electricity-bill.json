Try to use these at night to reduce the need for air conditioning during the warmest part of the day. Alternatively, use a crockpot or microwave oven, which don\u2019t produce as much as heat as an oven. Grilling outside is also a good way to cook without heating up your home."

Your AC can use too much power if it isn\u2019t appropriately sized for your home. Window units, for example, are only intended to cool a single room. Consider purchasing a new AC system. A new, high-efficiency system uses roughly half as much energy as 15-year-old system. You can personally check to see if an outside unit or heat pump is being blocked by anything. This can significantly increase your energy costs."

Dirty filters can also cause your AC to break down prematurely, further increasing your expenses. You should try to change the filter once a month. Consider purchasing a permanent filter. These only need to be washed periodically. At a price of $20 to $40, you will recoup the cost of a permanent filter in about a year."

Use a fan and verify that nothing is blocking the flow of air through your house. A fan doesn\u2019t exactly cool your home, but by pushing air around, it will distribute the heat better. Keep vents open. You might have forgotten that you closed a vent in your house. If so, your AC will keep on running to little or no effect. Keep doors open.

          "description":"One good way to keep your home warm is to prevent the heat from coming in to begin with. This can involve some small home repairs, but often it just requires simple lifestyle changes. Check for leaks in your weather stripping around your doors and windows, as well as holes around pipes and the circumference of your garage floor. Use caulk to close up any holes. Your home can get especially hot if you allow the sun in. Close your blinds during the middle of the day to keep your home cool. Insulation in your attic floor should be approximately 12 inches thick. Do not put boxes on it or walk over it frequently, because this will compress the insulation and make it less effective."

Turn the AC down when you leave the house. Purchase an automatic thermostat that will turn off when your house cools down. The EPA estimates that a programmable thermostat can save you as much as $180 per year; such thermostats cost as little as $25. Keep heat-producing appliances like lights away from the thermostat; these can throw off its readings. Refrain from mopping, washing dishes, and washing clothes during the height of the day\u2019s heat. These tasks produce moisture, which will make the house feel humid and uncomfortable."

Energy Star is a federal program that certifies products as energy efficient. An Energy Star product should save you money on your utility bills. Everything from light bulbs, refrigerators, TVs, washing machines, and furnaces can be Energy Star certified, though certain of these products will save more energy than others. Immediately replace your light bulbs. Replacing a single light bulb with a Compact Florescent Light (CFL) or, even better, a Light Emitting Diode (LED) bulb can save as much as $123 per year. They also last longer, saving you money on replacement costs, and generate less heat, reducing A/C bills. Wash with cold water. Washing clothes in cold water can save $152 per year. Washing clothes in warm water does nothing to make them whiter, brighter, or cleaner than they otherwise would be. Air-dry clothing. Driers use considerable energy. You can save that by placing your attire on a clothes\u2019 line. If you don\u2019t have that sort of outside space, many department stores sell racks that make it easy dry several articles of clothing in a small space. Set your water heater at 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). Anything higher than this puts you at risk of scalding yourself with hot water. Even in lieu of that eventuality, setting your water heater higher than 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C) will definitely hurt your bank account. The EPA estimates that setting your water heater 20\u00b0C higher could cost you nearly $500 a year. Handling your Power Finances Pick a provider. Some states, including Texas and Pennsylvania, allow you to pick your own power provider. When doing so, go to the official state power website for a comprehensive list of providers and rates. Beware, there will be imitations that provide biased information. When reviewing plans you should watch out for hidden fees. Typically you will need to wait for your contract to expire before signing up for a new provider. Contact your power provider to see how long your contract lasts. Beware of the difference between fixed and variable rate plans. Variable rate plans allow for hikes in your power price over the term of your contract. They often advertise low introductory rates that will only go up over time. Your state website might have a record of the company\u2019s historic rates that will give you a sense of their average price. Read the contract closely to see if the company charges if you, for example, talk to a service professional. It is also common to charge minimum usage fees. These can stick you with additional fees if you reduce your energy usage. Check your meter. Sometimes your utility company might make mistakes when reading your meter. Check the meter readings at the end of the month and compare it to what you see on your energy bill. Call if you believe there is a discrepancy. When reading a meter you will see several dials. Read these dials from right to left to get a full measure of your kWh usage. When the dial is between two numbers, you should always estimate down to the lower number. Even if the dial is directly on a number, you should estimate down one. Even if you find that your energy bill is correct, reading your meter can be a useful way to keep track of whether you have been able to manage your electricity usage. Save electricity with the off-peak reduced rates. Some power companies charge more for power used during specific times. Contact your service provider to see if this applies. If so, you will typically be charged less for power used during the evening. Try to perform energy intensive chores during this period.",
