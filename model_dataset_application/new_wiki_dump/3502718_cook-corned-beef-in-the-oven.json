  "text":" Preparing the Corned Beef for the Oven[1]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Preheat Oven to 350\u02da F (177\u02da C)  Drain the corned beef brisket. Store-bought corned beef usually comes wrapped in plastic to keep the beef moist in brine, a solution of salt in water. Cut the package open and allow liquid to completely drain. Discard or save seasoning packet (used for boiling method). If corned beef is homemade, drain brining liquid. Place the corned beef, fat side up, on large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil.  Trim excess fat from the brisket using a sharp knife (if necessary).  Poke 10 to 15 small holes in the top (fattier side). This process, known as jaccarding,  tenderizes the meat by cutting the connective tissue. Insert cloves into the top of the corned beef, evenly spaced.  Spread sweet hot honey mustard over the top of the corned beef brisket.  Sprinkle brown sugar over the honey mustard.  Cover the corned beef brisket with large sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil. Arrange the foil to allow for a small amount of space between top of brisket and foil. Secure the bottom piece of foil to top piece to keep juices that are released during cooking to remain within foil wrapping. Baking the Corned Beef in the Oven Place foil-wrapped corned beef on a shallow roasting pan.  Set roasting pan on middle rack of oven.  Bake for approximately two hours. Check the corned beef every thirty minutes to ensure brisket doesn\u2019t become too dry. The meat should be flaking apart by the end of the cooking period. Finishing the Corned Beef Remove roasting pan from oven.  Open the aluminum foil cover carefully.  Spread additional sweet hot honey mustard over top of brisket.  Place the roasting pan back in the oven with corned beef uncovered and roast for 2-3 minutes. Allow top of brisket to become bubbly and golden brown. Remove the corned beef from oven and place on cutting board.  Unwrap tin foil and allow corned beef to rest, undisturbed, for 5-10 minutes.  Slice the corned beef at a diagonal, across the grain of the meat, into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick slices.  Serve immediately with your choice of delicious side dishes. ",
