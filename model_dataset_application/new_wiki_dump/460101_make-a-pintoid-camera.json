Gather the items needed for making the pinhole apparatus. These are: an acupuncture needle and a sewing needle glued into a clothespin. Cut some small pieces from a pie tin, or other suitable material for the apparatus.  Using a piece of cardboard as backing, turn and press while holding the needle in a vertical position.

If the hole isn't perfectly round, chuck it and make a new one. Smooth the apparatus using sandpaper.  Paint it black too.  Using Gaffer's tape, tape the pinhole to the inside of the 1/4\" (6.35mm) drilled hole. Gaffer's tape is black, cloth-like tape. It's flat black unlike most electrical tape, which is shiny.
