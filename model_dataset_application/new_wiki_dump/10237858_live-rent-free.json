You can rent an extra space in your house or property by signing up at https://www.airbnb.com/host/homes?from_nav=1. Use the income you make with Airbnb to cover your own rent and living expenses.

Charge more for the other room so you can pay less or nothing for your own rent. This way, you can stay in your own house for free. For instance, if your 3 bedroom space costs $1200 to rent out, you can charge 2 roommates $600 each per month. That way, you don\u2019t have to pay a dime for rent. Since your roommate is going to be paying for the rent, make sure you're carrying your weight by cleaning around the house, taking care of the lawn, and managing rent and utility payments.

You can save your rent money each month rather than paying for a room of your own. If you have a roommate, notify them of your plan before you find a subletter. For instance, if you have a 2 bedroom apartment, find 1 person to rent your room rather than staying there yourself. If your apartment costs $1000 a month, you can charge the subletters $600 a month to make extra money. Be sure your roommate approves of the subletter before they move in.

In addition, if your vehicle can tow a trailer, you can invest in an RV to live in a motorhome. While both require money to maintain, fuel, and insure, it costs a whole lot less than renting a place of your own. You can park your car or RV on a friend\u2019s property or stay at Wal-Mart and rest stops for free. Wal-Mart allows travelers to sleep in their parking lot for free.
