      "description":"Raw or partially cooked meats will not shred. The type of preparation you should use will vary based on the type of meat and the desired application. Poultry is tender enough to be shredded well after nearly any cooking preparation. Poaching the meat in water will leave the flavor as neutral as possible, which is ideal for tossing it in a sauce. Low-temperature methods like braising and smoking will allow you to shred the meat most easily. Tender cuts of beef or pork, like tenderloin, should be cooked using a high-temperature method like grilling or saut\u00e9ing. Cook the meat all the way through for the best results. Tough cuts of meat, such as skirt steak or brisket, require a slow, low-temperature cooking method like braising or smoking. These cuts have a high amount of connective tissue, and will not pull apart readily unless cooked for a long time."

      "description":"Once the meat is fully cooked, allow it to rest before shredding it; if cut into immediately after cooking, the meat will dry out. For most applications, the meat should be removed from the heat source and placed under a loose tent of aluminum foil. Braised meats are better left to rest in the braising liquid."

Repeat this process until all of the meat has been shredded into small pieces. It is easiest to shred when the fork tines are aligned with the grain of the meat, while pulling against the grain."
