  "text":" Preparation Line a loaf pan tightly with foil. Spray lightly with non-stick cooking spray. Get out 6 microwave-safe cereal bowls. Divide up the ingredients evenly so that each bowl holds:  1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk, 6 ounces of white chocolate, and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Making the First Layer Put one bowl in the microwave. Microwave at 30 second intervals, stirring well after each 30 seconds, until the chocolate mixture is smooth and well combined. Remove from the microwave. Add red food coloring to the melted chocolate mixture. Stir thoroughly, until there are no white streaks left. Scrape the sides of the bowl to get all the way to the bottom. Pour this red layer into the prepared loaf pan. Bang the pan on the counter a few times to settle and remove air bubbles; then even out the layer. Place the red layer into the freezer. Freeze for 20 to 25 minutes, until hard to the touch. Making Additional Layers Repeat making layers from the remaining bowls. For each layer, follow the process outlined for the first layer, only this time making a blue layer, then the yellow, orange, green, and purple layers. Work quickly when adding all of the subsequent layers. Once the loaf pan and the each layer have been in the freezer, each subsequent layer will almost immediately start to set as it is added. This means that you need to move quickly when spreading out the mixture and banging it on the counter, to prevent it from becoming lopsided or lumpy. Freeze the entire fudge for longer when completed. After the final layer, put the completed fudge back in the freezer. Leave to set for 2 hours. Then move it to the refrigerator to completely set for a few more hours. Serving the Fudge Prepare the slices. When you\u2019re ready to cut the fudge, remove it from the refrigerator. Flip the fudge out of the pan onto a cutting board. Carefully peel to remove the foil. Cut into squares or slices. This fudge tastes better at room temperature and holds up pretty well for a few hours; otherwise, refrigerate it in an airtight container to keep. Dip a sharp knife in hot water between cutting each slice, and wipe with a towel. This will help to stop the colours from smearing together. Finished. ",
