Reverse osmosis devices are usually installed under the sink and use tiny membranes to screen out harmful materials like lead. They also tend to waste water while treating it, which raises their operating cost. If you have well above 15 \u00b5g/L of lead in your water, you will definitely want to consider a reverse osmosis device despite its cost.

A regular Brita filter may not be enough to remove lead. If you want the convenience of filtering your water as soon as it comes out of the faucet, purchase a faucet filter. If you don\u2019t want to take up space in your sink with a filter, purchase a distiller. Conveniently, many distillers also act as water dispensers."
