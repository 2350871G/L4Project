          "description":"Check your pet\u2019s height and width with a measuring tape. Then, add 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) to each one. Get a pet door in these dimensions to ensure that it will be the right size for your pet. This may help to prevent larger intruders from entering your home. For example, if your pet measures 18 in (46 cm) tall by 8 in (20 cm) wide, then a pet door that measures 20 by 10 in (51 by 25 cm) would be ideal. Warning: Never get a door that\u2019s smaller than your pet because they may not be able to fit through it safely."

To avoid this, move the bowls to another location in your home that is well away from the pet door, preferably in another room.

If your pet door has a latch, lock it when your pet won\u2019t be using it, such as at night or when you take your pet somewhere. Make sure that the edges of the pet door seal tightly when it is closed. Inspect the edges before you latch the door."
