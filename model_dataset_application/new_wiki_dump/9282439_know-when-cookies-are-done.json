Make sure to remove the cookies before the edges turn dark brown or they'll be burnt. For example, you can test the doneness of peanut butter, oatmeal, and other drop cookies by using this method."

If you wait too long to remove your cookies, the topping can burn and turn dark brown. If your bar cookie recipe calls for placing the topping on towards the end of baking, you'll need to keep close watch on the crumbles to make sure they don't burn. The cookie's interior is usually fully cooked by this point."

It's helpful to look at a photo of a done cookie before baking, so that you'll know what to expect. With these types of cookies, you'll see more firmness and an almost dull color."

This is normal and simply means that the cookie may continue baking on the sheet and rack once removed from the oven. Taking cookies out of the oven at this stage will make them softer and chewier. Whereas, overcooking can create brittleness."

If the edge stays firm and doesn't fall inwards, then your cookies are done. If you leave a noticeable indention, then your cookies likely need a few minutes more in the oven. This is an especially good method to use with dark cookies, such as chocolate or gingerbread, where coloring isn't the best indication of doneness. If you choose to use your finger to test, make sure to be very careful or you could get burned by the baking sheet. If you are working with a fragile cookie, like shortbread, test them by pressing lightly into the center instead of the edges. This will lower the likelihood of them breaking up upon contact."

The cookie should appear light brown or golden in coloring and firm in texture. Be very careful when lifting or you could split the cookie in half. This method works well for sandies, spritz, and other pale colored cookies."

Keep going until you reach the halfway point of the cookie. Withdraw the toothpick. If there are lots of crumbs or batter on the wood, then the cookies are not quite done. It's important to use wood skewers or toothpicks. Metal ones do not work as well as the crumbs will simply slide off."
