At night, they can tolerate a temperature drop to 55\u201360 \u00b0F (13\u201316 \u00b0C)  It is best to keep them indoors where the temperature can be adjusted or monitored, especially in extreme seasons like summer and winter. If you do put the plant outdoors during moderately warm weather, keep it out of direct sunlight and bring it indoors when temperatures drop at night. Note that temperatures on your window sills or near windows may be warmer or colder than the rest of your home."

Leave at least 5 inches (13 cm) of empty space around it to let it get sufficient air. Keep a small fan near the plant to help improve air circulation when things get stuffy. When you water, make sure there is no standing water left on the surface of the soil."

If natural light is not an option, place your orchid under grow lights for 14-16 hours during the day to simulate sunlight. When setting up your grow lights, use 1 warm white tube and 1 cool white tube placed under a reflector. Grow lights can be purchased at hardware stores or online. Plants should be placed approximately 8 inches (20 cm) under the lights."

Allow the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the soil to dry before re-watering. Some species of dendrobium orchids have water-storing pseudobulbs, meaning they can go 2 weeks between waterings.

You can also place a shallow tray filled with water near your plant to help increase humidity in the immediate area. Do not place the plant in the tray of water, as the water may rot the roots of the orchid over time."

Dip a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol and rub it over the surface of the plant to kill and remove the bugs.
