      "description":"High demand items on your trade list will get you a lot of trades as many people desire these items. Collect high demand small items, and remember these don't have to be very rare items. Things such as non member den betas are in decently high demand as they are a popular item used to trade for spikes, small decent rares, etc. Other decently demanded items, such as small promos, black worn blankets, neon bows and arrows, small spikes, etc. may also get you more trades than usual. Collect some of these rares and place them on your trade list and you may get frequent offers for them. Den betas, black worns, etc. are in high demand because they can easily be used to trade for spikes, which are extremely popular in the game."

      "headline":"Collect spikes.",
      "description":"If you don't have spikes, that's fine - there are other ways you can get traded frequently on Animal Jam, even if you're non member. Spikes are a very popular item in the game - one of the most popular rares, and they are the base item used to trade for very large rares such as party hats, headdresses, furries, etc. The rarer the spike, the more offers you will get for it. An orange short wrist will rarely get offers, but a black long collar will get you a lot of trades. Longs are highly wanted because people would rather trade directly for longs rather than trading more den betas than they need to for short wristbands and then trading up to short collars, longs, etc. This is especially the case for black longs. It's better to trade 20 den betas for a red long than 32 den betas for two pink longs and then trading those for the red long."

      "headline":"Place items of high demand on trade.",
      "description":"High demand items are, as the name implies, are demanded more often by traders. High demand items include spikes, crystal pegasus armor, etc. will get you more trades than low demand items. Most low demand items are actually very rare, such as party hats, but few people want them now as much as they did before. However, you can still put them on trade as they are of high rarity and despite the decrease in rarity because they aren't as wanted, they can still be used to trade for rarer items. You can check the demand of items through the Animal Jam Worth wiki, which also provides updated information on items' worth as well."

    {
      "headline":"Place larger and rarer items on trade.",
      "description":"Items like these include party hats, headdresses especially, founders' hats, elf tail armor, tiki masks, and anything that's worth more than just a good long collar. Some of these items may be rare, but they have very low demand, which varies across items. Keep in mind you may not get as many trades for a tiki mask, for example, as you would a party hat, despite them both being in low demand. Larger items like headdresses and more are coveted greatly and offered for frequently."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Overtrade.",
      "description":"This may sound ridiculous, but if you have extra items, like extra small clothing betas that you can easily trade for more items of value like non member den betas, you can overtrade those for certain rares. You'll get more offers if you're accepting undertrades that won't make a difference in your rarity. For example, if your rarest item is a headdress, it won't really matter if you trade 3 clothing betas for a small member den beta. If it won't affect your rarity too much, be willing to overtrade to obtain rares that people prefer to other items. Avoid overtrading for very rare items unless you're fine with it or unless it isn't too much of an overtrade. For example, overtrading by a few den betas for a headdress doesn't really matter that much since a few den betas is nothing compared to a headdress. But if you're overtrading by a whole black long, that's drastic, so avoid doing so unless you're okay with it. The problem with the trading system is that items are so separated in rarity. Small spikes have gotten less rarer and large spikes have gotten rarer, and there is no in between. This is the same issue with multiple other rares. Because of this, most people want overtrades and it is very hard to undertrade for an item and get it or even to get a fair trade unfortunately. So if you need non member den betas, it's okay to trade 4 rare fox hats for one if you have extras, because in the end, a non member den beta is more preferable than a few fox hats, especially when you're trying to build up to a large item. Again, most people want overtrades, so this is another way you can get frequent trades and offers if you're accepting, say 2 non member den betas for your black worn when it's really worth 4."

      "headline":"Make yourself visible.",
      "description":"Aldan tends to get crowded in every land. If you're non member, try to place yourself in a visible area and type in your username into whatever you're saying so that even if someone can't see your nametag, they can still type it up and be able to trade you. If you're member, you can do the same, but you can also turn into a flying animal so your nametag is more visible. If a nametag is hard to click, people tend to give up attempting to try to view their list. Make yourself visible and be sure people can view your trade list one way or another. This may assist a little bit in allowing you to get more trades."

    {
      "headline":"Go to the right places for the right trades.",
      "description":"Of course, Aldan is the best server to go for when you trade, but there are certain places within Aldan where people trade for larger items or smaller items. In all the lands except Temple of Zios, you can get more offers for your den betas or longs than you would in somewhere like Brady's Lab. In Brady's Lab, usually traders with items of much greater worth, especially headdresses and black longs trade in there. So you would get more offers for an orange headdress in Brady's Lab than you would in a random land like Coral Canyons. This can affect the amount of trades and offers you receive, so choose which land or room you want to trade in depending on the items on your trade list."

      "headline":"Say something tempting.",
      "description":"Saying something like, \"Black long on trade, doing attempts,\" isn't very tempting because it is known that when someone is doing attempts for an item, they're only trying to see the worth of that item based on the trades that they get, but they won't accept. Instead, you can still do attempts, but say something like, \"Black long on trade, looking to accept.\" Or if it's something you really want to get rid of, say, \"Den betas on trade, need to get rid of them,\" or, \"Headdress on trade, willing to accept a tiny under if I like.\""
