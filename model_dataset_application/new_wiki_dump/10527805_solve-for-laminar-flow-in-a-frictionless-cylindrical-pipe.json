Really take your time familiarizing yourself with the system and exactly what is happening in it. This may seem obvious, but it is easy to miss crucial details about your system if you do not take the time to do this now. The example problem being worked through is as follows: Oil at 20\u00b0C is flowing steadily through a horizontal, 5-cm-diameter, and 40-m-long pipe. The pressure at the pipe inlet and outlet are measured to be 745 and 97 kPa, respectively. Determine the equation for the velocity profile throughout the pipe, knowing that the oil has a density of 888 kilograms per cubic meter and a viscosity of 0.800 kilograms per meter per second."

At this point, the hardest part of solving more complex problems for you will be figuring out what order to solve things in. As you get better, this will become more obvious.

Secondly, what direction is your flow changing in; this may be obvious, but can be a little confusing sometimes. Your velocity will rarely change in the same direction as it flows. Next, plot an approximation of your velocity profile in your diagram. Plotting will be helpful later on, and should force you to really think about what assumptions you made, and if they are realistic."
