This points to Lester Crest\u2018s\u2014one of Michael and Trevor\u2019s partner in crime\u2014location on the map. Follow the L icon on the map to find and talk to Lester. He will tell you that he can manipulate the stock market if you perform some assassination missions for him. He will also tell you which stock will lose its value after you perform the hit and which one will sell like hotcakes."

Get into a car and follow the target icon on your map showing the location of the person you need to assassinate. Once you get to the place, pull out your weapon and kill your target. Assassinations are best done using a sniper rifle from a long-range distance. This will let you kill the target without acquiring a wanted star. Once you\u2019ve killed your target, the assassination mission will be completed."

On the fourth column you\u2019ll see how much percent each stock went up or down in market value. You\u2019ll notice that after killing your target, the stock that Lester told you will sell like hotcakes, will go up over 100%. When this happens, click the name of the stock to open it on a new page, and click \u201cSell\u201d to start selling all the shares you have."
