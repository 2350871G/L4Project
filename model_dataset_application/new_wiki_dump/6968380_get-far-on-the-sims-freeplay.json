For beginners, a quest is where Sims complete certain actions for special unlockables and even limited time prizes! You have to complete quests for marriage, babies, toddlers, preteens, teenagers, adults (when aging teenagers) and seniors. When you level up, you also get LP. LP speeds up actions. 1 LP is worth 1 hour, so if you have 12 LP you can speed up a 12-hour action, but LP cannot speed up part of an action (e.g. you can't use 1 LP on an action with 12 hours left for it to only have 11 hours. You must wait until it needs only 1 LP for the action to be completed.) And leveling up also allows you to buy more buildings with Simoleons- Simoleons are the currency."

There are a certain amount of prizes that you can win in a row. If you collect all of the prizes in one row, you win an actual prize. Sometimes it's XP, sometimes it's LP, sometimes it's a new item, sometimes it's Simoleons, sometimes it's town value. Once you collect all of the prizes in all of the rows, you win an exclusive item. Sometimes hobbies have a limited time prize- like the Salsa Dancing adult hobby had a limited time prize and usually when you unlock a new hobby with a quest there is a limited time item that you could win. If you don't get the item, then you can't buy it later either- it's limited."
