          "description":"A pinch of sea salt or Himalayan pink salt atop the fruit will bring out its sweetness and add depth. It also takes away some of the sour notes of the amla. You do not need to peel the amla before slicing and eating it. Find fresh amla at an Indian grocery store when it's in season from December to April or order it from an online retailer. How to Pick a Ripe Amla\nFeel for firmness. The amla should be slightly firmer than a grape. Choose full, round fruits. Amlas that are irregularly shaped are either unripe or less flavorful. Look for a neon yellowish-green hue. If they're too green, they not be ripe yet. Avoid bruises or bad spots. Fruits with these will mold faster and may already be rotting inside."

          "description":"Slice the amla and lightly toss the slices with lemon juice and salt. Set the slices on a plate outside in direct sunlight for a few days until they\u2019re completely dry. Thinner slices will dry faster than thicker ones. You can use a food dehydrator if you have one instead of setting the slices in the sun."

Let the fruit cook until it\u2019s soft before removing from the heat. Cutting small slits in the fruit before you boil it will let it soak up the turmeric and salt better. If you like amla a little crunchier, cook it for less time."

Soak the amla in a brine in the refrigerator, making sure the brine completely covers the fruit to keep it preserved. Serve it over rice or dal, which is an Indian lentil dish. Pickled amla has the same detoxifying benefits as kimchi, which is fermented cabbage. It helps improve digestion and eliminate waste and toxins from your body. Basic Brine Recipe\nIngredients:\n1 cup (240 ml) of any type of vinegar\n1 cup (240 ml) of water\n1 tablespoon (15 ml) of kosher salt\nBring all of the ingredients to a boil in a saucepan on the stove. Stir the mixture until the salt is dissolved. Pour the brine over the amla in glass jars and seal them tightly."

Treat it like a salsa and use it to top steamed vegetables, meat or tofu, or rice. Buy it from a grocer or make it yourself at home. Look for chutneys that have less preservatives and added chemicals. Chutney is also served with traditional Indian foods like idlis, dosas, and kebabs."
