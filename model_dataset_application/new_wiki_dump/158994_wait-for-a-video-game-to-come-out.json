      "description":"Listening to music distracts you from most other things, so you'll forget about that date leering at you on the calendar a few weeks away. If you must, fuel your obsession with music from other video games you like, or cool movie soundtracks. Lord of the Rings, Legend of Zelda, and Harry Potter are all great music soundtracks to listen to."

      "headline":"Look at a video game (easy one) that you have beaten before, and play through it again.",
      "description":"This passes time very easily! (Note, this is better done if you replay the game with cheats or with unlocked content. E.G. infinite ammo, better guns, infinite health, etc.) This tip also works better if the game you are waiting for is part of a series- play any other games that came before this one so the storyline is fresh in your head."

      "headline":"Chat with friends or play useless online games.",
      "description":"While MSN or Facebook games get a little boring after a bit, they still take away an hour or so from your day. It's better then nothing, right? And waiting a day for your cabbage patch to finish growing is better then waiting a whole two weeks for that game."

    {
      "headline":"Do some sort of craft.",
      "description":"Make sure it's one you find absorbing. Knitting is fun- but your mom might look at you a little funny if you ask to borrow some yarn and needles. Try making a cool bracelet or drawing something. It can be related to your game, to keep your excitement levels running high."

    {
      "headline":"Run outside.",
      "description":"A block will take you about 5 minutes if you jog it. Your parents may notice how active you are and let it slip if you spend the next few days playing your game once it arrives. If you'd rather not run, you can do short 5-minute exercises. They can be found all over YouTube, and some of them really do help build muscle. Be a buff gamer!"
    },
    {
      "headline":"Eating some food you like definitely passes the time.",
      "description":"If you combine this with exercise it works pretty well. Just make sure you save all the handy snacks for when you'll need them in a few weeks. It really sucks when you're hungry but you've run out of popcorn to take with you while you game."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Buy a quick easy video game.",
      "description":"Tomb Raider: Legend is very easy, and takes  about a day to complete. And it is very cheap. It's an excellent way to pass 10 hours. Also, there are many games out there that don't really end. Animal Crossing, Minecraft, The Sims... try entertaining yourself with these fun sand-box games. They'll make the time pass almost instantly."

      "description":"In the same room as your gaming console, keep a pair of scissors so you can cut the plastic immediately. Open all the doors which lead to the room so you can take a quick sprint. Wear flip flops so as soon as you come back with the game, you can throw them off and run to the gaming area."
