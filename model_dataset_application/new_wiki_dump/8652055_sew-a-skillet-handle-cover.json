The insulating and outer fabric should be going in one direction and the inner piece should be going in the other direction. Think of the fabrics like the pages of a book facing downward. You should only see the insulation, seam, and backside of the inner lining fabric. Fold the seam so that the inner fabric is facing up and then sew along the edge of the inner fabric to flatten the seam. Sewing along this edge will help to flatten the seam against the insulating and outer fabrics."

You will need this gap for turning the handle cover inside out and revealing the outer fabric. After you finish pinning, sew along the edges except for the two inch gap along the long edge of the fabric. You can stitch around ends in a square shape, or you can stitch in a curving fashion. Either one works, but stitching a curved hem may provide a better fit for the handle cover. You can stitch curved ends free hand or use a pen to draw a curve and sew along this edge. Be sure to sew both ends."

To close the gap you left for inverting the handle cover, sew across the edge. Don\u2019t worry about any visible raw edges.
