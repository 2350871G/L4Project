If your knife doesn\u2019t slice through the paper, it\u2019s time to sharpen it. The knife should continuously cut through the paper without stopping if it is sharp and in good shape."

These settings are the same on electrical sharpeners, though an electric sharpener may have an additional slot between \u201ccoarse\u201d and \u201cfine.\u201d"

          "description":"Insert the blade into the manual sharpener at the base, which is where the blade meets the handle. Use gentle force, pushing the blade down as you pull it through the slot, toward your body. Repeat this action 3 to 6 times, 3 for a mildly-dull blade, or more for a severely-dull blade. This action resets the blade, restoring it to its original sharpness. Use enough force when you pull the blade through that you hear an audible grinding sound. If you\u2019re using an electric sharpener, you won\u2019t need to press down\u2014the whirring mechanisms will take care of everything for you."

Instead, follow the curve of the knife so that the handle comes up and is higher at the end than it was at the beginning. This way, the entirety of the blade will get sharpened. If you\u2019re pressing down, you\u2019ll be able to tell by the sound and feel that you\u2019re moving the blade the right way. If you no longer hear the grinding noise or feel the resistance of the blade, you probably aren\u2019t following the contour closely enough."

You don\u2019t need to use as much force with the \u201cfine\u201d setting, and the grinding sound won\u2019t be nearly as loud as it was in the \u201ccoarse\u201d setting. If your sharpener has more than one setting, pass the knife through each in-between setting 1 to 2 times, making sure that you end at the \u201cfine\u201d setting. These additional setting are just gradations of grinding and help fine-tune your knife even more."

Dry the knife off completely to prevent it from rusting, and return it to its knife block or similar storage space. Avoid running your knives through the dishwasher.

If you do a daily or semi-weekly pass through the manual sharpener, chances are you won\u2019t need to do much more to keep your knives sharp."

Honing doesn\u2019t actually remove any steel from the knife and doesn\u2019t technically sharpen it, but it does push out-of-line edges back into place, which in turn makes your cuts sharper and more precise. It doesn\u2019t require much pressure, and it\u2019s something you can use on a daily basis to keep your blades sharp. Don\u2019t use a honing rod in lieu of sharpening your knives with an alternative method from time to time. It can bend the edge over time, making it hazardous to use."

Some companies allow you to ship your knives to them if you don\u2019t live nearby (you\u2019ll need to pay the shipping costs, though). Check out your warranty! Some knife brands offer free sharpening for life, so that might be something you could take advantage of, too."
