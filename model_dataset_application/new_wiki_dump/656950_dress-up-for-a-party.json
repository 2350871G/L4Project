          "description":"As everyone knows, choosing the right outfit for a party is a very important task. The first thing you need to consider is the time and location of the party, as this will affect everything - from your outfit and your shoes to your jewelry and makeup. If the party is during the day, at a bowling alley or theme park, you probably want to go with something comfortable yet cool, like jeans and a statement tee. Many people would not describe this as dressing up at all, but dressing up is a relative term. If the party is at night, in a fancy restaurant or club, you will probably need to go a little dressier and wear something like a cute dress, a playsuit or a skirt and top combo."

          "headline":"Consider your own personal style.",
          "description":"When you're attending a cool party, you want to stand out -- but in a good way. So if you want to be unique, you should come up with a cool alternative to the norm that suits your personality but still fits with the vibe of the party. For example, if you're not the type of girl who would normally wear high heels, but you still want to look glam, you could try wearing a pair of bejewelled sneakers instead!"

          "headline":"Think about your budget.",
          "description":"Can you afford to buy a new outfit, or do you need to work with what's already in your wardrobe? If it's the latter, consider combining your existing clothes in new and unusual ways, try layering a couple of tops on top of each other, clashing non-matching patterns or combining unusual fabric -- like a black biker jacket with a pretty silk dress."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose your jewelry.",
          "description":"When it comes to jewelry, decide whether you want to go understated and classic, or bold and over-the-top. For elegant evening parties, things like delicate diamond (or crystal) earrings and pearl necklaces are perfect. For night parties, you can go with bold statement pieces, clash chunky gold and silver chains, or wear large hoop or dangling earrings."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Match or clash your shoes and purse.",
          "description":"Traditionally, women matched their shoes to their purse, but this is no longer the case -- nowadays, pretty much anything goes! You can either pick out a color from your outfit (it doesn't have to be the main color) and match your shoes and purse to that, or you can go for a bold color clash. For example, if you're wearing a simple black dress, something like gold shoes and a neon orange handbag could work really well."

          "headline":"Do something unique.",
          "description":"After you've taken care of the shoes, the purse and the jewelry, any other accessories you choose to wear are really a matter of personal preference. Consider wearing a boho headband, embellishing your hair with fresh flowers, wearing an anklet or an upper arm band, layering on a chunky belt or rocking a funky trilby hat -- it's completely up to you!"

Whatever style you end up going for, make sure your hair is freshly washed, so it is easy to work with and smells nice and clean. Keep things simple. If you want to keep things easy, try straightening your hair with the flat iron for a simple, sleek look, or try curling it with a curling wand to achieve glamorous, loose waves or pretty, tight ringlets. Try an updo. If you want an updo, consider trying a classic French twist, an elegant sock bun or a chic braided updo. Experiment with braids: If braids are more your thing, try a French braid, a fishtail braid or braided headband."

You could even try a new color or an interesting new cut, like a side fringe, a pixie cut or a bob! However, if it's a birthday party you're going to be careful -- you don't want to upstage the birthday girl with your new 'do!"

Try bright pink or dark purple lips, neon eyeshadows and glittery mascaras."
