Wipe it down with a washcloth or sponge, making sure to get into the crevices of the lid as best as you can. For pitchers with electronics in the lid, be sure to not submerge them in water. For Brita pitchers that feature a chrome lid, mix one teaspoon of vinegar into a cup of warm water and gently wipe the lid down with a soft cloth dipped in the water."

Use a soft cloth or sponge as opposed to steel wool or any other harsh scrubbers. Dawn, Palmolive, and Joy are examples of mild dish soaps which are good to use."

Drying the pitcher with a towel may leave small fibers which will get into your water. If you are in a hurry, dry the pitcher with a paper towel to avoid leaving cloth fibers."
