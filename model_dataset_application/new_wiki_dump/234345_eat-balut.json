For the first way, season the egg by sprinkling it with seasoning or rolling it around in your seasoning bowl. Then, eat the egg yolk and embryo together in one or two bites. To savor the egg a little more, use a spoon to break away bites of the yolk, and dip each bite in your seasoning bowl. When you\u2019ve eaten the yolk, move on to the embryo and eat small bites in the same fashion. The balut egg white is edible, but some people choose not to eat it because it\u2019s tough and rubbery."

Balut eggs may be difficult to find, but check with Filipino restaurants, Asian grocery stores, specialty delis, and even local duck farmers to find a supplier of raw, fertilized duck eggs.

Simply place the eggs in a basket or bowl and serve them with your desired seasonings. Make sure each person has an egg cup, shallow bowl, and spoon. Eating Balut Locate the rounded end. Some balut eggs will come with a stamp on one end, and that is the end you're supposed to open. If your egg isn't stamped, find the fatter, rounded end of the egg (as opposed to the more pointed end). Place the egg in an egg cup or ramekin with the pointed side down. If you don't have these items, use a small cup or plate. The pointed end of the egg contains the egg white, while the rounded end contains the yolk and broth. Break the shell with a spoon. Use the bottom of a spoon and tap the rounded side of the egg three times to break the shell. Pick away the cracked bits of shell to form a small opening in the top of the egg, being careful not to let pieces of egg shell fall into the broth. Create an opening in the egg about the size of a bottle cap. Use your fingers to pick away at the layer of skin protecting the egg just beneath the shell. This will release the broth. Prepare your seasoning. Balut is often eaten with salt, pepper, vinegar, chili pepper, or diced green onion. Take your desired seasonings and mix them together in a small, shallow bowl. Season and drink the broth. Take a small spoonful of seasoning and drop it into the hole you made in the egg shell. Use the spoon to gently stir the seasoning into the broth.
