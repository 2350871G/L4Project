Pour the sugar water over the watermelon when most or all of the sugar has dissolved. Place the lid on the container and refrigerate the melon chunks for about 3 hours so the sugar water can soak in. Use enough sugar water to cover all or most of the watermelon chunks. For example, if you have 3 cups (681 grams) of watermelon cubes, you\u2019ll need about 3 cups (710 mL) of water and 3 cups (681 grams) of sugar. Use less sugar if you don\u2019t want to make it super sweet. Serve the watermelon with some mint or basil leaves to add a refreshing or sweet flavor element."
