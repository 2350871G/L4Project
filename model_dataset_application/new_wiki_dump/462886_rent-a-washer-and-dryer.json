          "description":"Prepare a space in a basement, roof deck, or other place that all tenants have access to. Check that the laundry area has the proper hookups necessary for installing the appliances. Washers usually need specific plumbing lines, and dryers need either a 240-volt circuit (for electric models) or a dedicated gas line (for gas dryers) as well as outside-facing vents. Make sure the laundry room is well-lit and visible so residents feel safe there. If possible, put it near an elevator so residents don\u2019t have to haul laundry baskets up and down stairs. If there are no common spaces in your building large enough for a laundry room, you could have a small closet on each floor that houses the washer and dryer. Alternately, you could rent machines to be installed in each unit in the building."

          "headline":"Choose a rental company that provides all of the services you need.",
          "description":"In addition to renting out machines, several vendors can provide a full range of laundry room services. If you tend to be a do-it-yourself type person, and are comfortable with basic appliance repairs, then you can probably save money by maintaining the machines yourself. If you\u2019d rather be more hands-off, find a company that will maintain the washers and dryers and collect coins from the machines. Some companies will even paint your laundry room and set up laundry tables. These extra services usually require a larger chunk of the laundry room profits. Make sure you understand your rental agreement. The laundry vendor should include you and your property under their insurance, and the contract should clearly spell out who is liable for damage to the machines as well as any appliance-related damage to your property."

          "headline":"Find someone who can properly install the appliances.",
          "description":"Often the company that you rent from will offer installation services. Alternately, check your local yellow pages or do a Google search to find a local contractor who has knowledge of the proper plumbing and electrical wiring needed to hook up the washer and dryer. Don\u2019t try to install the machines yourself unless you have the proper expertise. Landlords are responsible for maintaining the safety of the common areas in their buildings, so if you hook up a washer improperly and someone gets injured as a result, you could be held liable."

          "headline":"Offer use of the appliances at a fair price.",
          "description":"Tenants likely won\u2019t expect high-end appliances unless the apartment unit is an expensive one. If the machines you\u2019re providing are lower-end models, however, you shouldn\u2019t charge as much to use them. If the rented washer and dryer are in-unit, or if tenants are otherwise expected to pay the water bill, don\u2019t have a coin-operated machine. These types of machines are more typical in a shared laundry room in a multi-unit building."

          "headline":"Include the cost of the appliances in your budget.",
          "description":"Set aside some of the rent money you take in to pay for the washer and dryer rental fees, as well as any possible repair or replacement costs. If the machines are coin-operated, you may be able to bring in enough money to pay for their upkeep and create additional revenue for your property. If the washer and dryer is in the tenant\u2019s unit, and you want them to be responsible for repairs, make sure that is clearly spelled out in the lease."

          "headline":"Inspect the washer and dryer regularly for damage.",
          "description":"Water damage is a very expensive problem that many landlords deal with. Tenants are likely to speak up if a washer is completely broken, but may not let you know if it\u2019s leaking while it runs. Walk through the area regularly to look for potential problems. Note and take pictures of any scratches, dents, or other damage, and save these for your records. If the washer and dryer are in-unit, consider adding a stipulation into the lease that you or someone from your company will stop in every 6 months to inspect them. Make sure to give your tenants advance notice before entering as required by local laws."

          "description":"Collect all of the details of renting and maintaining each washer and dryer together in one document. Save information from the original rental agreement, as well as any information related to repairs or inspections. Using a free website or app such as Evernote or Google Drive can be useful for collecting this information. You can save all files and lists relating to your washer and dryer in one place. You can also take a photo of the manufacturer\u2019s sticker, which should contain the model and serial number. Taking multiple time-stamped photos of each appliance is also helpful in case someone breaks them. You can more easily assess new damage, and may be able to use the photos in court in case a tenant breaks or steals a machine."
