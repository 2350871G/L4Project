          "description":"If you have the time, you can soften cream cheese by simply storing it at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Once the cream cheese reaches room temp, it should be noticeably softer. If it still feels cool to the touch and isn't soft enough, let it sit another 20-30 minutes. You can leave the cream cheese in its original container or you can transfer it to a new one. If the cream cheese still isn\u2019t soft enough after an hour, you may need to stir in another ingredient like milk, lemon juice, or whipped cream to soften it."

          "description":"Spreading the cream cheese out can help it soften without the addition of any heat. For instance, you can place the cream cheese in a bowl, then use the back of a spoon to stir it. The more you stir, the softer the cheese will become. If you have a stand mixer, beat the cream cheese with a paddle attachment for about 60 seconds."

          "description":"For an even faster approach, try placing the cream cheese between 2 sheets of parchment paper, then break it up with a rolling pin or the flat side of a mallet. As the cheese spreads out, it should become soft fairly quickly. Keep in mind that you will have to scrape the cream cheese off the parchment when you\u2019re finished."

Press the back of a spoon into the cream cheese, either through the wrapper or directly into the cheese itself. If it gives way easily and offers no resistance, it should be soft enough for most recipes. On the other hand, if it's still firm, you may want to warm it a little more."

          "headline":"Don't let softened cream cheese sit for more than 2 hours.",
          "description":"Cream cheese has a fairly long shelf life: in the fridge, it can sometimes last for up to a month and in the freezer it can easily last twice that. However, like many dairy products, it spoils fairly quickly at room temperature. After you warm your cream cheese, try to use it as quickly as possible, returning any leftovers to the fridge. Do not leave cream cheese at room temperature for longer than 2 hours. If it\u2019s been left out longer than that, consider throwing it away."

To heat larger portions of cream cheese, add 10 seconds to the microwave time for each additional 8 ounces (225 g). If the cream cheese gets too soft, transfer it to a cool bowl, then leave it at room temperature for about 5 minutes. You can also place it in the refrigerator for 2 minutes, if you prefer. If your cream cheese came wrapped in metallic packaging, do not place the foil in the microwave. If any of the liquid, known as whey, separates from your cream cheese when you heat it, just add it into your recipe along with the solids."

However, do not use hot water, which can melt the solids in the cream cheese. If the cream cheese has already been opened, put it in an airtight plastic bag or wrap it tightly in cling wrap to prevent water from getting in. If the cream cheese was frozen, use cold water instead of lukewarm. It will take longer, but the cold water will help the cream cheese heat more evenly."
