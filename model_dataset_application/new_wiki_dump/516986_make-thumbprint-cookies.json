  "text":" Preparing the Dough Place the butter, sugar and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl. Beat the ingredients together with a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mixing on medium speed for about 2 minutes. Pour the flour and salt into a sifter or a sieve. Either crank the sifter over a second mixing bowl or tap the sieve so that the flour and salt sift through the mesh and into the bowl. Add 1 cup of the sifted dry ingredients into the butter mixer, mixing on low speed until just combined. Continue adding the dry ingredients in 1-cup increments until you have mixed them all into the wet ingredients. Spread flour on a cutting board, on wax paper or on a work surface.  Dump the dough from the mixing bowl onto the work surface. Use clean hands to flatten the dough and to shape it into a disc. Wrap the disc of dough with plastic wrap and chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  Preparing the Cookies Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180\u00b0C). Place an ungreased baking sheet on the stovetop. Set the bowl containing the egg wash on the counter next to the stove. Empty the coconut into a shallow bowl and place that bowl next to the egg wash. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Roll a 1-1/4\u201d (3 centimeter) ball of dough in your clean hands. If you use a scale while you\u2019re baking, then the ball of dough should weigh 1 ounce (28 g). Roll the ball of dough in the egg and water mixture.  Dip the ball of dough into the coconut.  Place the ball of dough onto the baking sheet. Continue preparing balls of dough, rolling them in the egg wash and coconut, and placing them on the baking sheet until the baking sheet is full. Each cookie should have about 1\u201d of space to allow it to spread out. Press an indentation into the center of each cookie with your thumb.  Measure 1/4 teaspoon of raspberry or apricot jam. Drop 1/4 teaspoon of jam into each thumbprint that you made. Bake the Cookies Bake the cookies for 20 to 25 minutes or until the coconut turns golden brown.  Remove the cookies from the oven and place them on the stovetop. Allow them to cool for 2 minutes. Remove the cookies from the baking pan using a spatula and place them on wire racks to cool. ",
