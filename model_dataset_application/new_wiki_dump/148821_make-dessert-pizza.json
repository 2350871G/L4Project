          "description":"This recipe has two main parts \u2013 creating the pizza dough crust and preparing the toppings. You can substitute purchased pizza dough for the homemade dough if you want to save some time. If you use purchased dough, the recipe will take about 40 minutes to complete. If you make the homemade dough, it will take an additional hour and 15 minutes. The ingredients will make 1 pound (450 grams) of pizza dough for the Chocolate Pizza."

          "headline":"Combine the warm water with the active dry yeast.",
          "description":"Put these two ingredients in a small bowl and blend them together. The water needs to be at a temperature between 105\u00b0F to 110\u00b0F (40.5\u00b0C to 43\u00b0C). Depending on how hot your tap gets, you may be able to use water straight from it. Run the tap until it gets warm and fill a measuring cup. Use a kitchen thermometer to test the temperature before adding the yeast. If the water is not warm enough, put it in the microwave for a few seconds or heat it up slightly on your stove. If it\u2019s too warm, let it sit for a minute or so and then use the thermometer to check the temperature again. After you\u2019ve combined the yeast and water, allow the mixture to stand for about 5 minutes while the yeast dissolves."

          "headline":"Mix the flour and salt together in a food processor.",
          "description":"While the yeast is dissolving, blend 2 cups (240 grams) of flour and 1 teaspoon (5 grams)  of salt in a food processor. A food processor isn\u2019t required, but the results are usually more consistent and it\u2019s much easier to work with. If you don\u2019t have a food processor, you will need to stir the ingredients vigorously at every stage."

          "headline":"Add the oil and then the yeast mixture.",
          "description":"Once the flour and salt are mixed, blend 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of olive oil in. After the oil is well-mixed, keep the food processor running and add in the yeast mixture (make sure the yeast is dissolved first). Continue blending until the ingredients are mixed together and a ball of dough forms. Carefully remove the dough from the machine."

          "description":"Sprinkle a flat workspace with flour and place the dough on it. Knead the dough until the texture is smooth, which should take about 1 minute. To knead, push the dough down and then stretch it out with the heels of your hands. Then fold over the top half of the dough and press down into it. Push out again with the heels of your hands. Repeat these same gestures to knead the dough. Continue the kneading process for 1 minute."

          "headline":"Pour several tablespoons of oil into a large bowl.",
          "description":"Turn the bowl so that the sides are coated. Place your dough ball into the oiled bowl. Turn the dough over several times so that it\u2019s coated in the oil. Cover the bowl (plastic wrap will work fine) and place it in a warm area, away from any drafts. Let the dough set until it doubles in size, which will take about an hour. Once it has doubled, punch down into the dough one time and then form it back into a ball shape. The pizza dough is now ready to use. You can use it right away or store it in your refrigerator for up to 24 hours in an airtight container."

          "description":"Sprinkle a flat work surface lightly with flour and use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a round shape that is about 9 inches in diameter. If the dough sticks to your rolling pin, rub a little flour all over the pin and then roll the dough out again. Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C) and place the oven rack on the bottom of the oven."

Make small indentions all over the dough \u2013 you can use your fingers for this. Warm up about a tablespoon of butter and brush it evenly onto the surface of the dough. Put it into the preheated oven and bake it for about 20 minutes. The crust is ready to be taken out when it looks golden brown and lightly crisp."
