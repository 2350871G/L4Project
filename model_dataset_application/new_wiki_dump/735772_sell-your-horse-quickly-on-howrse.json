Usually the more passes the BM items cost, the higher you can raise the price of your horse. People collect retired and non-retired coats (Golden Apple) so horses with coats can bring a very high price. There is more demand for Instant Pass Horses and Morpheus Arm horses than ever so they are a good choice to sell. 5th Elements are very rare now so they would also be a good choice to sell.

If your horse has skills, BLUP, and a BM item, raise the price, but don't go overboard. Having a 30,000 equus price will turn most people off unless your horse is truly spectacular."
