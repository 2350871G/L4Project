Try adjusting your carpet or bringing the clock away from the wall. Use a carpenter's level by placing it on top of the grandfather clock. If the bubble is at the center, your clock is on a level surface."

          "description":"Most grandfather clocks play a melody and chime on the hour. In order to set the time without playing the melody, move the minute hand counterclockwise. Winding the minute hand 1 full rotation counterclockwise will set the clock back by 1 hour. Do not move the hour hand. Use the time on your cell phone for the most accurate time reading. If the clock is 2 hours fast, wind the minute hand counterclockwise 2 full rotations."

          "description":"If your clock is only off by anywhere from a few minutes to an hour, it will be faster to move the minute hand in a clockwise direction. Wait at each quarter hour for the melody to finish playing before you continue to move the minute hand. Winding the minute hand 1 full rotation clockwise will set the clock forward by 1 hour. You will hear a click when the minute hand reaches each quarter hour before the melody plays. Do not force the minute hand forward when you hear the click."

If they seem to be catching another mechanism, wait 2 hours and then try again. For months following those with less than 31 days, you will need to manually reset the date on the 1st. You should never need to reset the phase of the moon if you keep your clock wound."

Then set the time on the clock by rotating the minute hand, making sure you don't accidentally move the hour hand. For example, if you hear 3 chimes but the clock says it is 2:00, move the hour hand to the 3. Then set the clock to the correct time."

If there are 1-3 small holes, these are winding points for a crank. Insert the crank and wind either clockwise or counterclockwise, whichever feels most smooth. If there are no winding points, look for chains next to the hanging weights. Pull the chains until the weights are at the top of the case. Then, gently move the pendulum to one side and release it, letting it naturally find its own rhythm. Keep an eye on your clock over the next day to make sure the time is still right and the pendulum is still swinging."
