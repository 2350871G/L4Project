Eight pieces will make a bulkier bracelet, while four pieces will give you a thinner look. If you're unsure this size will fit, wrap another piece of 8 inch duct tape around your wrist with the adhesive side facing out. Decide if you want to increase or decrease this size."

Use a longer strip to attach the two ends together if the bracelet feels too snug. Showcase your new bracelet to your friends or start selling them!"
