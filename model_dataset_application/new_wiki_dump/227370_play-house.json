Since small kids will need a little imaginative encouragement, it's a good idea to set up a playhouse or dollhouse to jump start play. If you don't have a playhouse or doll house, set up couch cushions or cardboard boxes to make a play space. If you make a cardboard playhouse, let your child decorate it with stickers, crayons, or markers."

For example, set out a toy vacuum, toy blender, toy tools, actual measuring cups, a small table with chairs, feather dusters, and plastic dishes. Don't feel like you have to completely fill the play space with toys. Too many toys can overwhelm small children. Instead, rotate out toys every few weeks to keep your child interested."

Ask your child which doll or figurine you should be. Keep in mind that the dolls or figurines don't have to match. The important thing is that your child is encouraged to imagine and play. For example, your child may want you to be a doll while they play as their favorite stuffed elephant. You might say, \"I'll be your elephant, Nuffie, but who will you be?
