If you are unsure, talk to their close friends or family members to feel out the party idea before proceeding. Also consider whether they enjoy parties or like being the center of attention.

They can help to make sure the honoree arrives at the right place at the right time. If you live with the guest of honor, your co-conspirator can help with RSVPs and their house can be used for planning purposes so you do not get caught with evidence. Choose someone close to the guest of honor and someone that you can trust to keep a secret."

You will have to secretly find out if they are available on the day and time that you have chosen. You can also choose a date before or after the honoree\u2019s actual birthday, to avoid arousing suspicion. Make sure your honoree is kept busy for a few hours to ensure the element of surprise. A short errand might not give you enough time, in which case you will have to speed up or rush the process.

Would they prefer an indoor or outdoor event? Will you be hosting the party in a private home? It\u2019s easier to coordinate details in a private home setting, but public venues are also great options. Choosing a public venue usually means you have less time to easily attend to details, because space is often rented shortly before your event, giving you less time to decorate and prepare. When choosing a location, make sure it is easily accessible to your guests."
