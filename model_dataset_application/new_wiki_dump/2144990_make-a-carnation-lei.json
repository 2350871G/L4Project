Threading the Carnations Together Put the needle through the center of your first carnation. Stick the needle into the face of the flower, right in the center. Push through until the needle comes out the other end of the flower. Pull the flower along the thread until it reaches the knot. The flower should slide smoothly until it hits the knot. Don\u2019t force the flower along the thread. If it ends up not sliding down smoothly enough, wait until you\u2019ve added a few more flowers. The added weight will help them slide along.
