If you don\u2019t know what you want to make out of the balsa wood yet, here are some ideas: gliders, airplanes, boats, model houses, and even bridges. If you can\u2019t find a premade stencil you like, then you can draw your own by hand or on the computer. Keep in mind that some pieces will need to intersect if you want to create a 3D model, so you will have to cut some slots to fit them together as well as the general shapes."

Purchase a geometry set that comes with a variety of utensils that you can use for this. You can use the utensils to help you cut perfectly along the lines you draw with them. You can also use them to help you cut along the lines of a stencil once you draw it onto a piece of balsa wood.

You can use a ruler or other straight edge to guide your knife along straight cuts. If you drew any lines with a curved utensil, like a protractor, you can also use that to help guide your cuts. Don't use a stencil to guide your cuts, as they generally aren't sturdy enough. Just use stencils for drawing the designs."
