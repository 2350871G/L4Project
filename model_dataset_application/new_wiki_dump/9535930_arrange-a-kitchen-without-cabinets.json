Use a tape measure to record a rough estimate of the item\u2019s dimensions. This can be laborious, but it will give you an idea of how to organize your kitchen. For example, measure the base of the toaster to find out how much counter space it needs. It\u2019s usually small and can be stored or surrounded by other objects. Don\u2019t forget that it needs to be near an outlet. Measuring the countertop space is a good idea, too. This will help you see how much countertop space you have to work with when arranging the kitchen."

With paper and pencil, draw a basic outline of your kitchen in order to visualize your perfectly arranged kitchen. One of the biggest advantages is vertical space.

Items you use infrequently can be placed on the back ends of shelves or moved to a different room. Use this tactic to organize food, too. For example, the peanut butter jar you plan on opening every day can stay near the front of a top shelf or basket. Place canned food you use sparingly in the back."
