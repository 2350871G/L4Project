          "description":"When you\u2019re moving is a great time to get rid of old things you don\u2019t need anymore. It can be a big stress relief and make moving easier, since you\u2019ll have less to move. When you\u2019re going through your things, put them into four piles: sell, donate, toss, and keep. You can try to sell some items online, while donating less valuable items to thrift stores. Minimizing the things you have can also relieve stress. You\u2019ll feel better when you\u2019re not worried about keeping everything you own in your move."

          "description":"It\u2019s important to have a clear idea of what you\u2019re packing and why. This will make unpacking that much easier and give you a sense of relief when you\u2019re finally moved into your new place. You\u2019ll want to start collecting boxes a few weeks before your move so you have enough to pack your belongings. Many retailers will give you boxes and you can buy specialty boxes at moving company offices. Label all of your boxes according to the category they belong in and they room they will go in. You can also organize them by color if possible or by number."

You may also need to cut off old utilities at your old place and set them up at your new. Prioritize your task list from most to least important. In general, anything involving specific payments or dates should be at the top of your list. Verify that you have the correct move-in and move-out dates for both places. You may need to pay double rent for a few days or weeks, but it will be worth it to get rid of the excess stress."

When you have small children, they will not be able to pack up their own room, but they can help clean in some small ways. It\u2019s important to not try to do everything alone. Even if you don\u2019t have a family, see if your friends may be able to help you during your move. Helping you pack or stay organized can be really useful during this stressful time. Hire help if possible and necessary. You may want to hire movers, depending on the amount of stuff you have and the distance you have to travel."

It\u2019s important to allow yourself to mourn the move as well as look forward to new challenges ahead. If you\u2019re moving because of some difficult life changes, it may be a good idea to try to stay on task.

If you have children in the tweens or teens, make sure there is something each day for them to do. You can do things like going for a walk, swimming, or seeing a movie.

Starting off each day with a healthy breakfast or a cup of coffee on the porch can be a good comforting routine. Even going for a daily walk at the end of the day can help you learn the neighborhood and help you to feel more comfortable in your new environment.

This can be especially useful if you have help from a friend or family member when you first arrive at your new location. You may also feel like you want to take your time unpacking.
