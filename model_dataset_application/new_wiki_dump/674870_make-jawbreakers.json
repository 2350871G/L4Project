Next, prepare a second recipe's worth of syrup, but give it a different color and flavor than you used for your first batch.

There are a number of ways to make your own flavorings for use in jawbreakers and other candies \u2014 nearly any sort of dense, strongly-flavored oil, syrup or liquid can potentially work. One cheap, easy way to make your own flavoring is to add just enough water to an individual packet of Kool-Aid powder to produce a liquid. Stir this into your mixture earlier in the cooking process than you normally would to allow the extra water to boil off. Another trick that works well for fruit flavors is to add a splash of fruit juice (plus a little grated zest if you have it) \u2014 as above, give the extra liquid a chance to boil off if you use this method."

Getting perfectly round jawbreakers like you'd see in a store can be quite tricky. Even round molds can leave a noticeable seam around the edge of the jawbreaker. Professional candy makers use a process called \"panning\" which involves rolling the jawbreakers in round vats of ingredients for long periods of time to produce their round shape.
