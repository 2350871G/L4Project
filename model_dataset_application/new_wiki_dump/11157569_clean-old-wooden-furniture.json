Take a damp cotton ball, add 1 drop of liquid dish soap, then wipe it on a hidden location, like the inside of a chair leg. If the detergent strips or ruins the finish, do not use it. Wait about 5 minutes after you apply the soap before you check it to make sure it won't damage your old wooden furniture. If the soap damages the finish, clean it with just water."
