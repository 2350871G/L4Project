For the oysters, you want to prepare them now so that you can add them quickly when needed. Pre-shucked oysters are a good call if you can verify they are relatively fresh by asking the fishmonger. Cooked oysters lose much of the \"fresh\" flavor anyway, so don't feel like you must shuck them yourself. They are sold at the fish counter."
