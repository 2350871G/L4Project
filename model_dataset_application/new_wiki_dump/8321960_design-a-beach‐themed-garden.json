Plants found along beaches have to survive harsh conditions, with varying temperatures, strong winds, and salty air. They have to be drought-tolerant as well. Great beachy plants include:\nBeach strawberry\nCommon thrift\nGold coin\nSaffron buckwheat\nSeaside daisy Consider getting a tree or 2. Great coastal trees include coast banksia and eucalyptus.

Adding Decorative Elements Fill plant beds with sand. After you have planted your flowers in their preferred soil, top it off with a layer of sand.

Things like surfboards, life savers, wooden oars, and ship wheels are all good bets. Clear, glass gazing orbs (not the mirrored kind) would also work well because they mimic sea glass. Furnishing Your Garden Use wood for furniture and decking. Another option is to use a synthetic wood made from recycled materials. Not only is this more environmentally friendly, but it also lasts longer. Use bright, bold, solid colors. If you can't find furniture in the right color, you can easily paint it using outdoor-quality paint. You can also use white or unpainted wood furniture, and then add color with bright tablecloths, pillows, and cushions. Add some beach chairs or a hammock. For a more traditional look, use unpainted, wooden Adirondack chairs. For something more relaxed and tropical, consider a macram\u00e9 hammock. Consider adding a fire pit. These do especially well in front yards. You can also put one in your backyard, however. When filling it, consider white pebbles, or glass\u2014but be sure to use the type meant for fire pits! Add some shade with an umbrella. If you want something more tropical, consider getting an awning made from straw or palm leaves instead. This would work great paired with a hammock and some tiki torches. Don't forget the lighting! Candles are a great option for just about any garden, but you can also install other lighting features as well. For example:\nIf you have a tropical beach garden, consider getting some tiki torches.
