          "description":"Stand behind the saw blade and locate the handle at the top of the saw. Follow the handle down to the rail that connects the head of the saw to the base. This rail is made of thick metal and runs vertically from the top to the bottom of the saw. On this rail, look for a small metal pin sticking out of the side. This pin is usually on the inside of the rail, but on older models it may be on the exterior side.Tip: Most brands of miter saw have a lock pin that is similar to the Dewalt pin. This method will unlock most miter saws, regardless of the brand. The lock pin is used to unlock the head of the saw so that you can move the blade up and down, but the guide rail will remain locked. You use the lever at the end of the guide rail to adjust the angle at the cut. If you have an older saw, this pin may be a knob. If you have knob lock pin, turn it counterclockwise to pull it out and clockwise to push it in."

Pull it out as far as it will go, normally 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm), and release the pin. Your saw is now in the unlocked position and you can move the blade freely. Whenever the pin is sticking out, the saw is unlocked. Always check this pin before picking your saw up to move it somewhere else. On a Dewalt compound sliding saw, pulling this pin out allows you to move the saw up and down on the rail that it\u2019s attached to as well. To lock the rail in place, twist the knob on top of the large bracket where the rails slide back and forth. Turn this knob clockwise to tighten it in place."

          "description":"To lock the saw, press the handle down until the blade is as low as it can go. Then, press the lock pin back into the rail to secure the blade in place. Ensure that the saw is locked by pulling up on the handle with the pin pushed in. If the handle doesn\u2019t move, your saw is locked. Always lock the saw when you aren\u2019t using it. It is dangerous to leave a saw unlocked, even if it isn\u2019t plugged in or running."

The guide rail is the horizontal platform that the saw blade drives in to.
