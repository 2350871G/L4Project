          "description":"This is the most popular way to eat a pizza. If the crust is thick and crispy enough to hold the weight of the toppings and cheese, simply lift it up and put the point of the slice into your mouth. From there, you can eat away and enjoy all of the toppings! For thin slices of pizza, this technique won\u2019t be as effective because the end of the slice will flop down. In that case, hold the pizza a little higher than usual to catch the end of the slice in your mouth."

Most New Yorkers claim that this is the best way to eat a pizza because it keeps the cheese in place and makes the pizza easier to eat while standing or walking. This technique also has the added bonus of protecting the roof of your mouth from getting burnt on the hot cheese."

Put your thumb and middle finger under the center of the crust, and use your index finger to push down on the center of the crust, making a \u201cV\u201d shape. You can also support the end of the pizza with your free hand to guide it into your mouth while you crimp the crust. Once you reach the middle of the slice you should be able to hold it up by the crust!"

This keeps the toppings on the slice and ensures that you get a ton of flavor in every bite! After the slice is folded, you can eat from any side. Most people recommend starting with the crust to keep the wallet from falling apart."

Start at the crust and work your way to the point of the slice to save the cheesiest and sauciest parts of the slice for the final bite. This tends to be a bit messier than other techniques, so make sure to have some napkins on hand for cleanup!"

          "description":"Most pizza enthusiasts will tell you to avoid the knife and fork at all costs, but sometimes they\u2019re unavoidable. For Chicago style or deep dish pizzas, cutting up the slice into smaller pieces with a knife and fork allows you to get a little bit of crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings in every bite. This is also the cleanest method for eating pizza and would probably be best if you\u2019re at an important dinner or out on a date. Most pizzas won\u2019t be served with a fork and knife, so be sure to ask the waiter or waitress to bring some utensils for you!"

Once you reach the crust, dip the end of the slice into your extra sauce, or tear it into pieces before dipping to avoid double dipping if you\u2019re sharing. Be sure to let the sauce drip off of the crust before you pop it into your mouth. Otherwise, you might end up with sauce all over your shirt."
