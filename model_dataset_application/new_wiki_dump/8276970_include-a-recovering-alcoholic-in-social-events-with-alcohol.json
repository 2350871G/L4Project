When you would like to include a recovering alcoholic in an event with alcohol it\u2019s definitely a good idea to talk to them about the event first.This way, you\u2019re inviting them and also giving them a chance to make an informed decision about whether or not they want to or able to attend. For example, you might say,\u201d I\u2019d like for you to come to an event with me but there will be alcohol there.\u201d\nOr, for instance, you could try, \u201cThere\u2019s a party I\u2019d like us to attend but they\u2019re going to be drinking.

If you are close to the person, ask them about things that might tempt them to drink. Knowing what their triggers are will help you and them plan for a fun, but safe event for everyone involved. You may need to ask if they are aware of any triggers they might have. For instance, you might ask, \u201cDo you know of any situations that might make you want to drink?\u201d\nFor example, the holidays, birthdays, or anniversaries may be hard for some recovering alcoholics.

You might ask, \u201cDo you feel that you are at a place in your recovery where you can handle this?\u201d\nOr, you might try saying, \u201cThere will be alcohol there.

Even though you may not want them to miss out on the event, you also don\u2019t want to risk their sobriety. For example, if your uncle just started recovery a few weeks ago after years of alcoholism, you may want to reconsider inviting him to an open bar reception. Consider having an intimate, dry get-together for him and a few others before the main reception. Or, for instance, if you are attending a baseball game and want your friend to come along, consider attending a \u2018family day\u2019 game where alcohol won\u2019t be served."

Try to offer a variety of non-alcoholic drinks if you are the person hosting the event. For instance, you might have juices, soda, and water on hand. It may also help to offer drinks that are not noticeably non-alcoholic so the person can avoid questions about why they\u2019re not drinking \u2013 this might include non-alcoholic beer, cranberry juice, or plain or sparkling grape juice. For example, if everyone is drinking flutes of wine to toast the new couple, you might offer the person a flute of sparkling grape juice or ginger ale.
