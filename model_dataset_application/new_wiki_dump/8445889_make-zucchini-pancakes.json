          "description":"Turn the oven on to 300 degrees F (148 C). Wash 2 medium zucchini (weighing a total of 3/4 of a pound or 340 g). Trim off the ends of the zucchini and throw them away. Grate the zucchini on the large side of a box grater so you get large shreds. Place the zucchini into a mixing bowl. Avoid using one really large zucchini instead of the two smaller ones. Larger zucchini can be stringier and have more seeds in the center."

          "headline":"Stir in the remaining batter ingredients.",
          "description":"Grate a little bit of red onion so you get 2 tablespoons. Add the grated onion to the mixing bowl with the zucchini along with 2 extra-large eggs, 6 tablespoons (48 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper. Stir the batter so the dry ingredients are incorporated. If your batter is really thin and separates from the grated zucchini, you can add the remaining 2 tablespoons (16 g) of flour to thicken it."

          "headline":"Heat and grease a skillet.",
          "description":"Get out a large skillet that's about 10 to 12-inches (25 to 30-cm) in size. You can use a cast iron skillet. Turn the heat on to medium and place about 1/2 tablespoon of butter and 1/2 tablespoon of oil in the pan. Let the pan heat completely before you cook the pancakes. The butter should melt and the oil will shimmer once the pan is hot."

          "headline":"Cook the savory zucchini pancakes.",
          "description":"Turn the heat down to medium-low and drop a few tablespoons of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. You should be able to fit several pancakes at once, depending on the size of your skillet. Cook the pancakes for 2 minutes and then flip them over. Finish cooking them for another couple of minutes. Continue cooking the pancakes in batches and add more butter and oil to the pan if the pancakes start to stick. Place the cooked pancakes on an oven-safe platter and put them in the preheated oven to stay warm. You can hold the pancakes in the warm oven for up to 30 minutes."

Spread the batter so the pancake is 4 inches (10 cm) wide. Drop more batter to fill the skillet and let the pancakes cook for 1 to 3 minutes, so the pancakes begin to bubble.
