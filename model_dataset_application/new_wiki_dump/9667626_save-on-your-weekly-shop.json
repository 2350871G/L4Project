          "description":"The advantages of shopping weekly include being able to plan out exactly what you and your family will eat over a 7-day period. This planning requires you to focus on every item needed for each meal and for each person, so that you won't over buy when shopping. A weekly plan is much more manageable than trying to do it monthly as recommended by many budget shopping guides; a month is just too far ahead to think about. Weekly, on the other hand, can be done at a regular time perhaps on the weekend or one weeknight, and always before the next shop. No need to buy the extra tin of beans or a loaf of bread to go in the freezer that is never eaten. You know what you need and that is all you bought."

Planning 7 days ahead ensures that when you get to the till, you only have what you need for the week. Check your pantry and fridge before you make your shopping list. What is still in there counts toward the next week and must be eaten, so be sure to include it in the planning and avoid doubling up!"

This way everyone will feel that they have a say and are responsible for alleviating meal monotony! Choose your favorite cookbooks that you enjoy cooking from, as this will give you the enthusiasm to stick with regular planning. Try to prefer cookbooks that focus on budget, thrifty and cheap cooking without sacrificing taste and enjoyability."

By buying just 7 days of vegetables and fruit you can ensure every pea, grape and egg is eaten\nWhen all the food gets eaten, it is never wasted; insects can't get to it in time, nothing goes off or turns rancid and you get the health benefits of the freshest food all the time!"

By shopping each week, you can pick up the ingredients for the weekly roast depending on what gives you the best deals. And, if you really can't live without one brand of products, then shopping every week means you always know when it's in the sale\nIf you prefer using paper catalogs, many stores still use these but the digital approach is easier as it's always at your fingertips and it's kinder on the environment. Most supermarkets provide deals that only last a few days, a week at most. By shopping every week, you can take advantage of all the items you like for less.

Even if the ingredients are not on your list, if they're an incredible bargain, grab them and use your imagination to make an additional meal, even if it goes straight to the freezer for later. Buying things at the lowest prices makes great sense for your budget. The reduced section will have things like items past their best by date (not use by date), dented items, returned items, items looking a little worse for wear but still perfectly edible and overstocked items. Look on the bottom shelves and the top shelves. These are the lower premium heights; manufacturers pay for the middle shelves because they're at eye level, so cheaper items are likely to be either lower or higher around these items. Try the home brand or budget brand. Often they're made in the same place as the more expensive ones and/or the quality is often similar or the same as the branded foods. It can be worth at least trying the cheaper brands to see if you like them; it'll save you a lot of money over time. Don't worry about what other people think of your food choices. A good cook goes for food quality over food snobbery; if the cheaper brand works just as well as the more expensive one, you're the one saving pennies toward your next vacation trip, the snob is too busy tossing their money away! Avoid stockpiling. Just because it's a bargain does not mean you need 5 boxes of it. That is potentially 4 boxes going off, never getting used or getting insect-infested; there is no bargain when you waste ingredients. Also, if you don't usually at it, the 3-for-1 deal is not a bargain but a big risk, especially if nobody in the house likes the item."
