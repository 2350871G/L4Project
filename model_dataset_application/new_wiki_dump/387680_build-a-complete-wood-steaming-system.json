This gives several hours of steaming without having to refill the tank. It also give you a bit or room for not refilling the tank if you're in the midst of bending a piece of wood when the water level reaches the bottom mark, this helps protect the electrical element and still give you lots of steam until you can add water to the supply tank. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/ce\\/Build-a-Complete-Wood-Steaming-System-Step-3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Build-a-Complete-Wood-Steaming-System-Step-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/ce\\/Build-a-Complete-Wood-Steaming-System-Step-3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Build-a-Complete-Wood-Steaming-System-Step-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

You want a box that will stand up to the water, hold the heat, and move steam from back to front in an even flow. Also, provide the space for several pieces of wood to be steamed at one time and be able to be of many different lengths of say 3 feet (0.9 m) to as long as 20 feet (6.1 m). {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5c\\/Build-a-Complete-Wood-Steaming-System-Step-5.jpg\\/v4-460px-Build-a-Complete-Wood-Steaming-System-Step-5.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5c\\/Build-a-Complete-Wood-Steaming-System-Step-5.jpg\\/v4-760px-Build-a-Complete-Wood-Steaming-System-Step-5.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

The box has an outside size of 11-1/4\u201d x7-1/4\u201dx 3 feet (0.9 m) to 10 feet (3.0 m). It is possible to use a steam box up to 20 feet (6.1 m) if you use the larger 4\u201d PVC boiler, same system, just using 4\u201d PVC in place of 3\u201d PVC. The steam box must also be set at a slight angle to induce good steam flow from back to front inside the box, the back side of the box sets lower then the front. This tilt helps keep the condensate to the back where the drain hole is and off the wood being steamed. To steam wood in a box it is necessary to keep the wood up as close to the top of the box as possible; this is where the heat and steam are. Another problem with the steam box is that most people try to seal it up. However, if you seal ALL the holes, the box becomes a steam bomb.One of the ways to prevent this is to not use latches or locks on the door. The door also should have a 1/4\" gap at the top of the door to induce slow but safe steam flow through the box. What you want here is a steam box that is safe and will not fall apart after a few uses, while giving you good bendable wood time after time. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2c\\/Build-a-Complete-Wood-Steaming-System-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-460px-Build-a-Complete-Wood-Steaming-System-Step-6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2c\\/Build-a-Complete-Wood-Steaming-System-Step-6.jpg\\/v4-760px-Build-a-Complete-Wood-Steaming-System-Step-6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nThe steam box stands over the PVC boiler/steamer and water supply tank supported by legs.
