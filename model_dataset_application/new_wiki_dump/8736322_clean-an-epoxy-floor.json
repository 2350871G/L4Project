They don\u2019t clean as effectively as hard foam mops, don\u2019t lend themselves to scrubbing and may leave streaks on your floor. Particularly difficult spots can be scrubbed with a brush."

If you have a garden hose, simply spray water over the whole floor, washing the cleaning solution away. If you don\u2019t have a garden hose, you can use a bucket of water, lightly splashing your floors. You can use a squeegee to rid your floor of water, sending it away from your floor. If the epoxy floor is in an area that doesn\u2019t lead to an exit, you can use a hard foam mop to soak up the water and wring it in a bucket."
