Players in PvP mode often use this technique to stun their enemy, making them vulnerable to skill attacks or combo.

To execute this skill, simply double tap the arrow button toward your enemy, and while running, press Z, Z, X. When you press Z, your character will slash the opponent after the dash, hitting them twice with 120%\u2013160%. Pressing X will execute the fireball within the combo, unleashing 270% magic damage. Aerial Fireball is another approach in releasing Fireball attack. This occurs when you jump to avoid any opponent then unleash Fireball while in mid-air. To execute this combo, run toward the enemy by tapping the arrow button and then jump by pressing up, followed by X and Z. By the time you jump and pressed X, your character will swing his sword, damaging any enemies who attempts to jump with you, causing 200% physical damage. At Z, you will release your Fireball, which will cause 200% magic damage. This is best done with fast combo execution."

To prevent this, use the Knockback Slash to knock them back, making them fall to the ground and vulnerable to your next combo. Simply tap on the arrows twice toward your enemy's direction to run and then press Z after the dash, followed by two more Z to attack. The first slash will inflict 120% damage if you manage to land a hit on your opponent. 160% for the second attack and 200% physical damage to the third. This combo also works on some boss.
