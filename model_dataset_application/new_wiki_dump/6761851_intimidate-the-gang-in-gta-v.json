Once you are there, a blue blip will appear on your radar and you\u2019ll hear a woman cry out for help. If that doesn\u2019t happen, the random event isn\u2019t occurring and you should come back at a later time, or with another character."

If you are carrying a weapon when you approach her, she will walk away and tell you that she doesn\u2019t need that kind of help. Doing that will cause the random event to become unavailable, but you can come back later or with another character to trigger the event again."

      "headline":"Equip a weapon and kill the three gang members.",
      "description":"They will all be firing pistols, so you may want to take cover. The corner of the house is a good place to take cover. The best choice of weapon is a shotgun, as you\u2019ll be at close range to the gang members. Once they have been eliminated, walk over their bodies to gather their ammo and the money they dropped\u2014anywhere from $500 to $1000. If you kill the woman as well, you will get a one-star wanted level and will need to outrun the police before the random event will be considered complete."
