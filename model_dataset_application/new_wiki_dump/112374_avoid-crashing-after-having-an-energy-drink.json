          "description":"Instead of drinking the entire energy drink at once, spread it out over the course of a couple hours. Not only will this prevent huge spikes in your adrenaline, dopamine, and insulin levels, it will also prevent the dips that cause the crash. Drink one to two ounces (30 to 60 ml) every 15 minutes rather than drinking it all at once."

To help your body metabolize the caffeine and sugar more steadily and to keep your energy levels consistent, eat healthy foods throughout the day (spread out over four meals), including:\nCarbohydrates, such as pasta, cereal, and potatoes\nWhole grains\nFruits, nuts, and vegetables"

          "description":"Caffeine can be a great way to give yourself some extra alertness, but there are optimal times of day to consume it to get the most benefits. During the day, your body has natural spikes in cortisol, which is a stress hormone, and you should avoid drinking caffeine during these spikes. The best times to drink caffeine are:\nBetween 9:30 and 11:30 a.m. Between 1:30 and 5 p.m."

          "description":"Although the caffeine in energy drinks can cause its own crash, a sugar crash will prolong and exacerbate the effects. For one, sugar crashes can be worse than caffeine crashes, and the two don\u2019t occur at the same time. While the effects of caffeine will last for at least five hours, a sugar crash will occur within about two hours. To avoid extra calories and the sugar crash, look for sugar-free energy drinks."

          "description":"This is particularly important for athletes looking for extra energy during endurance training. Your body loses electrolytes when you sweat, and your muscles burn off glycogen during long workouts, so it\u2019s important to replenish these stores during workouts that exceed an hour."

To prevent dehydration from energy drinks, be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Dehydration can cause sleepiness, irritability, headaches, and confusion, which will only make an energy drink crash worse."

While everybody is different, anyone over the age of 14 needs between seven and 10 hours of sleep per night in order to give the brain time to rejuvenate. Caffeine consumption can actually create a vicious cycle, because while you might have a coffee after a long night when you didn\u2019t get enough sleep, that caffeine can actually prevent you from sleeping properly the next night, which will result in you being tired again the following morning."

On the one hand, physical activity promotes blood flow, which carries more oxygen and nutrients to your cells, giving your body more fuel to burn. On the other hand, exercise also promotes better sleep, which in turn leads to you feeling more energized as well. To get the most out of your days, make sure that physical activity is a regular part of your routine. Healthy adults should aim for at least 2.5 hours of moderate activity per week. This can include working in the yard, brisk walks, or leisurely swims. Healthy adults who are more active should aim for faster paced exercises, such as swimming laps, jogging, or stair and hill climbing."

Coffee, which contains more caffeine than tea, should be consumed in small amounts over the course of a day, rather than all at once."
