Cactus seeds could take up to a year to germinate and several years for the young cactus to begin to flower. Unless you have a heated greenhouse, it's best to sow cactus seed in the late spring. Seed companies often offer many mixed varieties of cacti seed. Use clean sterilized shallow pots to begin your seeds. Use a mixture of potting soil and sand. Place the seeds on the soil and cover them with just enough sand to anchor them. Keep in mind that cactus seeds don't germinate well if they have been sown too deeply. Dampen the soil enough to wet the seed. When the soil dries out completely, use a mister to keep it moist. Do not over water. Cover seeds with glass or plastic wrap and be sure to wipe away any condensation that may form. When seedlings appear, remove the cover. Carefully prick apart any seedlings that have grown together. Place the seedlings in light, but not in direct sunlight. Keep temperatures around 70 degrees F (21 degrees C)."
