By painting your walls a shade of white (or a light neutral color, like gray or beige), more light will bounce off of them, which will make your home brighter. If you don't want to paint the whole interior of your home white, choose the one or two darkest rooms and paint just those. You might want to go with an off-white shade.

If you don't want to get all new furniture, cover your existing furniture with white or gray slipcovers to quickly brighten it up.

Just buy LED light bulbs that are the right size and wattage for your fixtures, then screw them into the fixtures throughout your home. LED bulbs come with different K ratings. The higher the rating, the cooler and whiter the lighting will be. A bulb with a 5,000K to 6,000K rating will be the most similar to natural light.
