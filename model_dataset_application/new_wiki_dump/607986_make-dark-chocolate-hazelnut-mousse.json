Roll and dry with paper towels and grind them to a fine powder in a food processor.  Preparing the Mousse Divide the heavy cream in half in two separate bowls.  Heat one of the halves over a low flame until bubbles start to appear. Don't let it boil over. Add this cream to the bowl of chopped chocolate and let it stand for a minute.  Whip the egg whites and sugar (if you're using any) until stiff.  Add the egg white foam to the warm chocolate and cream mixture and gently stir center-out until no white streaks remain.
