      "description":"The industry standard is to add \u20444 yard (0.2 m). to all material orders. You do not want to be short on your concrete order. In this case your initial order amt. would be 1.776 Cu. Yds. + .250 or \u20444 yard (0.2 or 0.2 m). for a grand total of 2.026 Cu. Yds. The importance of using all of the decimal points is illustrated in this case scenario. As you can see the 2.026 Cu. Yds . in the total amt is not necessary as part of your final order because you have over ordered by \u20444 yard (0.2 m). This will compensate for the 2.026 yards (1.9 m). Your final order amt. would be 2.0 Cu. Yds."
