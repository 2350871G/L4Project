A typical stuffing uses high quality sliced white bread, challah, or bagels. For more unusual flavors and textures, try sourdough or cornbread. Avoid crusty, airy bread, which tends to become mush. An electric bread knife makes this much easier."

You can skip this step if the bread is already hard and stale, or if using cornbread. Optionally, toast a couple handfuls of pine nuts or roughly chopped walnuts on a separate tray. If using pine nuts, remove after 5\u20137 minutes to prevent burning."

If you plan to cook the stuffing inside the bird, just use \u00be of your stock, so it can still absorb turkey juices. If the stuffing refuses to clump together, beat one or two large eggs, then stir it into the mixture. Wait until just before you stuff the turkey. If you have the time, you can make your own turkey stock in advance. Place the turkey giblets in a small pot of water and let simmer one hour."

Before removing the turkey from the oven, check that its internal temperature has reached 165\u00baF (74\u00baC). Measure the temperature at the center of the stuffing, the thickest part of the breast, and the innermost part of the thigh and wing. A stuffed, 8-pound (3.6 kg) turkey takes about 3 hours to roast, while a stuffed 22-pound (10 kg) turkey takes about 5 hours. If the turkey is done cooking but the stuffing isn't, remove the stuffing and cook it in a greased casserole dish until finished. An instant read thermometer takes about 15 seconds to read the temperature. A normal food thermometer must be left in for 5 minutes."
