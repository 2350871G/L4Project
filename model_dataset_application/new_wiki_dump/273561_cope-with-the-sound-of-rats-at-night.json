These are known to help reduce stress levels and improve your sleep, so they can help you cope with the sounds of rats at night. For a simple exercise:\nSit in a comfortable position, such as cross legged or on a chair. Focus by breathing in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds, then slowly exhaling through your mouth. Try to clear your mind of worries by focusing on a single visual object, repeating a short mantra (like \u201cI am at peace\u201d), or visualizing a place that makes you feel calm and happy. Do this as long as you like, but at least for a few minutes."

Snap traps have a spring-loaded mechanism that pins rats down when they step on it. Glue traps work by trapping rats that walk on their sticky surface. Place several traps in places where rats are (look for their droppings). Set them in narrow places (such as behind boxes or furniture) so that rats are forced to walk on them. Bait the traps with food rats are likely to enjoy, such as peanut butter, raisin bread, bacon, or candy. If you find a rat has been trapped and killed, wrap it in newspaper or a plastic bag and throw it away. Wash your hands afterwards."

Carefully follow the usage directions and precautions advised by the manufacturer. Many forms of bait will come installed in pre-made, secure containers. Place these near the suspected rats. The rodents will enter the container, eat the bait, and die. Poisons are often not recommended for use in buildings. Rats may eat the bait, then die and decompose in a hard-to-reach space like the interior of a wall."
