That is, athletic squirrels can jump ten feet horizontally and five feet vertically. Pole baffles are the easiest to situate. You can use either a straight pole or a shepherd's staff pole, just make sure that it is tall enough. Place the pole ten feet away from any trees, fence or other structure from where the squirrel might jump. Mount the baffle five feet high on the pole. Make sure that feeders hang above the top of the baffle. If you want to hang a baffle, the best way is to string a wire between two trees, place the baffle in the middle, ten feet away from either tree, and hang the feeder underneath the baffle. Make sure the bottom of the feeder is above five feet. Metal baffles tend to be most effective."
