          "description":"Before setting lethal traps, make sure it's legal to exterminate or relocate voles in your area. Traps can be an effective way to control vole populations that are concentrated in a small area, like an average residential yard. However, they're not a practical management option for infestations that affect larger areas, such as an orchard. Signs of a vole problem include damage to crops and garden plants, holes and unsightly areas in lawns, and gnaw marks on tree bark near ground level. For widespread damage over an extensive area, rodenticide bait will probably be more effective than snap or box traps."

Set them perpendicular, or at a right angle, to the tunnel entrances; use 1 trap per 100 sq ft (9.3 m) of land. Check your traps daily, and remove any dead and captured voles. Purchase covered traps, or fold a shingle over a standard trap to avoid catching birds and other non-target animals. Wear gloves when you dispose of any trapped voles. Bury them or dispose of them in a tightly sealed bag. Don't leave dead voles in the traps, as this would promote disease and attract other pests. Be sure to keep children and any pets away from snap traps."

For general guidelines, set 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of rodenticide pellets in a bait container at the opening of a vole tunnel. Keep small children and pets away from rodenticide.

Alternatively, you could make your own using PVC pipe or water-repellent mailing tube. Cut a 12 in (30 cm) length of pipe or tube, place the rodenticide bait inside, and bury it inside a vole tunnel. Accidentally killing non-target species may be illegal in your area, so taking safety precautions is important."

Monitor them for up to 10 days, then place traps baited with apple or peanut butter by tunnel entrances to check your progress. If you don't catch any voles, your chemical applications were effective. If you still have a vole problem, continue using rodenticide bait, or consider calling a professional. Remember to promptly dispose of any dead voles."

Cultivate dense clay soils in autumn, and sandier soils in spring. Divide your yard into strips, till trenches along each strip, then fill trenches with the soil from the strip beside it. Additionally, it's wise to test your soil and, if necessary, add fertilizer or adjust the pH when you till."

Use stakes to support cylinders of \u20444 in (0.64 cm) wire screen mesh or hardware cloth around your trees and garden beds. The mesh shouldn't hug or press into your tree trunks or other plants. Bury a barrier 12 in (30 cm) into the ground. Above ground, your barrier should reach a height of about 18 in (46 cm). For colder climates, make sure the barrier is as tall as your highest snowfall.
