          "description":"Knowing what can be recycled is important to ensuring that it gets recycled and doesn't end up as waste. Currently, the EPA estimates that over 80% of office waste is recyclable. By identifying what you can recycle at work, you can make a positive impact on the environment. In most cities, office recyclables fall into the following categories:\nPaper products, including office paper, poster board, corrugated cardboard, magazines, newspapers, paper folders, envelopes and mailers, sticky notes, paper binder dividers, unsolicited direct mail, and books. Plastic, including food containers, beverage bottles, and binder clips. Glass products, including beverage bottles, jam or yogurt jars, and vases. Metal products, including paperclips, staples, binder clips, aluminum cans, and aerosol cans. Special recyclable items, including batteries, laptop computers, used office supplies (such as pens, markers, and highlighters), ink cartridges, and cell phones. These items are usually recycled separately and should go into their own receptacles."

Look around your office to locate the recycling bin closest to your desk. Once you are aware of the locations of the recycling bins nearby, you can easily make a habit of dropping off your recyclables in the bin (rather than in the trash). Recycling bins are usually blue or green and are generally located next to or near trash bins. Many recycling bins have the universal recycle symbol printed on the front. This symbol contains 3 arrows that twist in the middle to form a triangle. Each of the arrows points to the beginning of the next arrow."

You can purchase a recycling bin online or in a store, or use any receptacle of your choosing. If your office has a centralized recycling system, you can empty your personal recycling bin into the communal recycling receptacles every few days, or whenever the bin is getting full. If your office does not have a centralized recycling system, you will need to drop off your recycling at the nearest recycling center, or bring your recycling home with you to add to the recycling bin at your house. To find the nearest recycling center, contact your municipal office or search on your local waste management provider's website. Keep in mind that depending on where you live, you may need to separate your recycling by category (paper, plastic, etc.). Contact your local municipality, waste management service, or check RecyclingCenters.org to find out the recycling regulations for your city."
