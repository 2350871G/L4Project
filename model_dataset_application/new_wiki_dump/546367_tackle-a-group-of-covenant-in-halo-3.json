Grunts are fairly easy to kill - one burst from a battle rifle will usually kill - so they should take up much time to eliminate. Drones are a little more hazardous - they can deplete your shields quickly and they're hard to get a lock on. Use a SMG or assault rifle to clear large areas on them and the battle rifle to pick off the last ones."
