Any taller than this and they will become fibrous and tough. Cut off the outer leaves and eat the tender inner portion. You can eat daylily shoots raw on their own, or dip them into a veggie dip, such as ranch, to give more flavour. Cutting back daylily shoots will not prevent the plant from growing.
