Some types may work for several cables types, others may be prohibited. Be sure to obtain any necessary electrical permits, even if your jurisdiction allows the work to be done by a non-licensed electrician. Many inspectors will want to see the \"listing label\" for your cable so they can verity that it conforms to the code requirements and standards for cable construction. Retain the label or package for later inspection."

When the cut is nearly through, grab the cable jacket above and below the cut and twist sharply - this should break the remaining armor without the need for the saw to contact the wires inside. Use caution - the metal edges are sharp. Carefully inspect the interior insulation to make sure none of the conductors have been exposed by nicks or gashes. If there is damage, you may need to try again by moving back and redoing another cut."
