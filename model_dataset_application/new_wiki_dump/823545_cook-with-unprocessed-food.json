Fruits and veggies should definitely be bought organically. Yet, some fruits and vegetables are higher in pesticides than others. Peaches, apples, sweet bell peppers, celery, nectarines, strawberries, cherries, lettuce, imported grapes, pears, spinach, and potatoes should all be purchased organically because of their high pesticide amounts. Onions, avocados, frozen sweet corn, pineapples, mangoes, frozen sweet peas, asparagus, kiwi, bananas, cabbage, broccoli, and eggplant don't have to be purchased organically due to their low pesticide amounts."
