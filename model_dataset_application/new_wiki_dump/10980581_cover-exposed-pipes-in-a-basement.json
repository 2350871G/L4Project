If you\u2019re concerned about the appearance of the enclosure, pick wood that\u2019s attractive as is, and/or will look good when finished. Otherwise, pick the least expensive wood that will do the job. Keep in mind that some woods are easier to work with (cut, fasten, finish) than others. If your basement tends to be damp, choose a wood that does well in higher humidity."

Having them neatly arranged in a tool box can make it easier to lay hands on the tool you need. Try to have more tools than just the basic ones, in case the project takes an unexpected turn. Use the tool best suited for each part of the project. For example, a flat head screwdriver might turn a Phillips head screw, but it could damage the screw in the process."

If there are obstructions such as posts or corners, it could be a tight squeeze. A tape measure has a moveable hook at the end. This is so your measurement will be accurate whether the hook is pulled out or pushed in. For precise measurements with a ruler, start at the \"2\" unit mark and then subtract one unit, rather than starting the measurement at the extreme end of the ruler."

Using a miter box can help you cut in a straight line at the correct angle. Cut as accurately as you can, but remember that it's better to cut off too little wood than too much. You can cut it shorter, but not longer! As a shortcut, if a precise number length is not needed for a piece, but other pieces need to match it in length, you can use the first piece as your \"ruler\" to measure the matching ones."

  "text":" Building a Wood Enclosure for the Pipes Choose a building plan for the enclosure. A simple way of constructing the enclosure is to secure a length of lumber to either side of the piping, and build the box out of thinner wood pieces by attaching them to the lumber and to each other with butt joints.

Hiding the Pipes Hide the pipes with furniture. This works well if you have a finished basement, or are working on one. You\u2019ll have to balance the flow of the room with your desire to conceal the piping, but in many cases the answer is already sitting in your basement ready to go! If the pipes are horizontal and low to the ground, something like a sideboard, or better yet, a couch, can block a good amount of space near the floor. If the pipes are vertical, consider using an entertainment center, a breakfront, a bookcase, or a wardrobe. Make sure you leave enough clearance between the furniture and the pipes to avoid accidental damage. Hide the pipes with a decorative screen.

A folding screen allows you to change up the width of the area the screen blocks, although there will be some space lost in the room itself if the screen is folded smaller.
