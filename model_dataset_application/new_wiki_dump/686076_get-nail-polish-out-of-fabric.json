Use a paper towel or cloth to wipe off as much of the wet polish as you can. Don't smear the polish so it covers, even more, surface area on the upholstery; rather, use the paper towel to wipe it off with short swipes that don't spread the polish around. Use the most absorbent cloth or paper towels you can, so you're leaving as little polish as possible to soak into the upholstery."

You may want to do a test dab on a part of the upholstery that's usually hidden. Acetone reacts with some types of fabric, including those containing acetate or triacetate, and could make the stained area look worse if you aren't careful. Do not pour the acetone onto the stained fabric since it's harder to control where it flows if you don't use an applicator like a cotton swab or the corner of a paper towel."
