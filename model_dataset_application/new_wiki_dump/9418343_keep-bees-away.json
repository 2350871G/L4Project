If you have potted flowers on or near your patio, remove these before a party or social gathering. If you\u2019re picking a location for a picnic, avoid eating near large displays of flowers, whether they\u2019re planted or naturally occurring. Bees are more attracted to some flowers than others. They\u2019re most likely to investigate wildflowers, along with honeysuckle, goldenrod, and lavender. Bees also like several herbs, including oregano, thyme, and chives."
