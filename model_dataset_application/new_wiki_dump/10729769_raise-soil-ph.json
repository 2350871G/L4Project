You can test it yourself, but if you send a sample of your soil into a lab, they can recommend how much lime or ash you need to add to your soil to amend it. Keep in mind that you want to amend the soil at least 2-3 months before you plant in the spring. Typically, you want your soil to be 6.5-7.0 on the pH scale for most crops, though it can differ depending on your area and the crop you're planting. If your soil is at 5.0, that's 10 times more acidic than 6.0. You can buy a kit at your home improvement store, or most local agriculture extension centers have soil kits."

          "description":"The soil test should list how much lime you will need to add to your soil, as long as you sent your soil off to a lab. In the U.S., the amount will likely be listed in pounds/acre, though it might also be listed in pounds/1,000 sq ft. If the number is in pounds/acre, divide it by 43.5 to get pounds per 1,000 square feet."

          "description":"The number you're given is based on the assumption that you will till 7 inches (18 cm) down in the soil to mix in the lime. However, if you plan to only dig 4 inches (10 cm), you need to reduce the amount you're adding. For 3 inches (7.6 cm), multiply the number by 0.4. For 4 inches (10 cm), use 0.6 as the multiplier and use 0.7 for 5 inches (13 cm). For instance, if the equation tells you to add 60 pounds per 1,000 square feet, multiply that number by 0.4 if you're only digging 4 inches (10 cm) to get 24 pounds of lime. Soil should be tested every 2-3 growing seasons to see if it maintains the pH levels you want. Make sure you do not overtreat the soil or else the pH will be more difficult to balance."

          "description":"Hardwood ash can also raise the pH level of the soil due to the calcium it contains. However, it contains about half the calcium that lime does, so you need to apply twice as much. So if you've determined you need to use 24 pounds (11 kg) of lime, multiply it by 2 to make 48 pounds (22 kg)  if you plan on using ash instead."
