The aged versions of this type of scotch tend to be a bit cheaper than single malts, but they can be just as flavorful. Corn can give scotch a sweet, vanilla or maple flavor, while rye gives it sweetness and spiciness. Wheat gives it a bready, sweet flavor."

          "description":"Blended scotch comes in 3 varieties: blended malt, blended grain, and blended scotch whisky. Blended malt refers to a scotch that mixes multiple single malts in one bottle, while blended grain refers to mixing multiple single grains in a bottle. Blended scotch whisky is a mixture of both single malts and single grains. These scotches can come from multiple distilleries. The flavors of blended scotches vary greatly. For instance, some might emphasize peat flavor, while others are in search of a mellow flavor. No single flavor defines these blends, so you just have to choose based on what you like. Because blended scotches can have several whiskys in the same bottle, they are usually not as high in quality as a single malt. If you're new to drinking scotch, you may want to start with a blended scotch to acclimate your taste buds to scotch and save a little money."

Of course, the more aged it is, the more you'll pay. Scotch must be aged at least 3 years, and if the bottle has a number on it, that typically indicates how long it's been aged. However, age isn't everything. Some people like very aged whiskys, while others prefer newer ones. Try different varieties to decide what you like. The longer the whisky is aged, the more flavor it will absorb from the barrel, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will taste better. Aging whisky too long can actually ruin its flavor."

The 5 regions are Speyside, Highlands, Lowlands, Islay, and Campbeltown. The Speyside region is known for a nuttier, fruitier flavor, due to the fact that it uses less peat (or sometimes none). It also favors a sherry cask. Glenfiddich, Glen Moray, The Macallan, The Glenlivet, and Tomintoul are all from this region. Whiskys from the Highlands have a bit more variety. Some are heavy and smokey, while others are floral and light. Glenmorangie, Dalmore, Ardmore, Dalwhinnie, and Glengoyne are from this area. In the Lowlands, scotches tend to be a bit mellower and more floral because they are triple distilled. You'll find flavor notes like ginger, toffee, toast, cinnamon, cream, and grass. In this area, you'll find Glenkinchie, Girvan, Linlithgow, Auchentoshan, and Strathclyde. Islay whiskys tend to be heavier with notes of peat smoke and salt. Ardbeg, Kilchoman, Bunnahabhain, Bowmore, Laphroaig, Lagavulin, Caol Ila, and Bruichladdich call this region their home. In the Campbeltown region, you'll find both heavier, smokier whiskys and lighter, citrusy whiskys. Mull, Sky, Orkney, Tobermory, and Jura are from this area."
