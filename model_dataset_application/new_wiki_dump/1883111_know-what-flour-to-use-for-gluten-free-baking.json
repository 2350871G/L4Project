Other flours to avoid include those listed as bulgur, durum, farina, graham, kamut, semolina, and spelt flours. Avoid flours that list ingredients likely to be contaminated with gluten unless the product is labeled as gluten-free. Frequently contaminated grain flours may include corn, soy, rice, potato, and beans unless otherwise stated.
