Dab the stain, again taking care not to rub it further into the fabric. You can apply slight pressure as you brush lightly across the stained area. Avoid using water on silk. Water can easily damage a silk tie by leaving water spots and spreading a stain but apple cider vinegar can keep the stain from setting in."
