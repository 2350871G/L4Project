Lay the hemp lengthwise across the lighter so that three feet of hemp extends from the top of the lighter, and the rest extends from the bottom. See figure 1. Hold the lighter in your left hand (if you are right handed) with your thumb pressing down firmly on the hemp; leaving the bottom end of the lighter exposed. See figure 2. While holding the lighter firmly with your left hand, take the hemp leaving the bottom of the lighter with your right hand and wrap TIGHTLY around the bottom of your lighter. Wrap from the bottom towards the top of the lighter. See figure 3. Wrap tightly until you can roughly gauge that you are one revolution from the top.  While holding the wrapped hemp on the lighter tightly (so it does not come undone) wrap the hemp around the lighter loosely once. Feed the end of the hemp (the end that you were wrapping with) under the loosely wrapped revolution, creating a simple hitch knot. See figure 4. Hold the lighter firmly and tighten the remaining loop with the knot as tight as possible.  Tie the two ends of hemp together to achieve your desired necklace length.  Apply a few drops of super glue to the hitch knot at the top of the lighter. This will help prevent the knot from becoming undone in the future. See figure 5.
