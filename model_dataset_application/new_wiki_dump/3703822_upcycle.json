If you don't own anything that you're ready to cut apart, experiment on items from a second-hand store or garage sale. Try somewhere unconventional. You might take a trip to a junkyard, estate sale, or old garage or barn. Take a walk through your house. You may come across a certain piece like an old chair that you like, but could use some updating. These can help give you a direction for your upcycling."

          "description":"The first step to upcycling is to know what you're going to do. This will help you plan what materials and supplies you will need and how much time to plan for. Most upcycling projects take an old item and make it into something that is functionally the same but with new style-- for example, you can turn an old baggy shirt into a more modern style. But you can also take an old item and change it into something completely different, like using an old door as a headboard for a bed or making a sculpture out of old silverware. You can start with items you have and then try to develop ideas, or get ideas and then look for materials. Try thinking about what you need at this moment. Do you need a new end table? What do you have around your house that you can put toward that? If you're clueless about how to begin to choose an upcycling project, try rummaging through your drawers, cabinets, or closet for things that you no longer use. When you find something interesting, start brainstorming ideas for a new use or new look for that item. Rely on skills you already have when choosing your upcycling project (unless you have the time and supplies to learn a new skillset!). For example, if you don't know how to use a sewing machine or a needle and thread, don't choose a project that involves sewing."

The best candidates are large and with a color palette that you like, but not a design that you want to keep. The final project will hide most of the painting but the colors will peek through your letters. You will also need 2\" vinyl letter stickers in a bold font you like and that appears easy to cut out, such as Helvetica (available at craft stores or online); spray paint in white or silver (you can use other colors, but make sure it contrasts enough with the main palette on the art so that your letters will be visible); and sharp scissors."

If that's not the look you're going for, a crisp, newer shirt might be a better choice. For a sturdier bag that will hold up to heavy items like books, try using an old sweatshirt."

To make a rounded opening, use a large bowl (like a salad bowl) as a guide. Line the bowl up in the center of the shirt covering the neck hole, and then use your markers to trace the outline of the bowl edge. This should make a nice rounded guide for cutting, just under the seams around the neck of the shirt. After outlining in marker, remove the bowl and then cut through both layers of the shirt. To make a more oval opening, freehand a large \"U\" shaped outline that starts directly on either side of the shirt neck and goes a few inches down under the bottom of the seam. Try to be as symmetrical as possible; if you don't like the lines you make, try again (the marker will wash out). Cut it out, cutting through both the front and back of the shirt."

The slits should be about 3/4\" to 1\" apart. Complete the slits all the way across the bottom of the shirt. When you're done, you'll have what looks like a fringed tank top."

          "headline":"Tie the fringe.",
          "description":"Since this is a no-sew project, you will tie all the fringes together to reinforce the bottom of the bag (so nothing falls out when you use it!). You can choose at this point whether you'd like the fringe to be visible on the outside of the bag, or if you want it to look more like it has been sewn shut with no fringe visible. For a fringey, boho look, keep the shirt right-side out and tie the fringe across the bottom. For a more polished, no-fringe appearance, turn your shirt inside out before tying the fringes. To tie the fringes (whether your bag is inside out or not), begin by tying the front and back sets of fringes in knots in pairs, all the way across the shirt. You will make two ties per set of fringes in order for it to knot and not come undone. Then, to close the gaps between the fringe knots, take one fringe from the first pair and tie it to one fringe from the second pair, tying twice to knot it. Repeat this across the entire shirt, tying every adjacent fringe pair to the one next to it."

You can even take it to the library to tote books that you borrow. Be sure to keep the bag clean, especially if you use it for raw meat, eggs, and/or produce. You can wash your bag between uses on a gentle cycle, and dry it on low. This will help prevent your knots from coming undone."
