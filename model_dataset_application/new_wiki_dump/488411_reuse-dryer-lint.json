If the dryer lint doesn\u2019t sop up the spill on its own, then rub it back and forth until it absorbs all the liquid. Throw out the dryer lint after you use it.

The lint will catch quickly and keep your fire burning for awhile! Mix melted wax and dryer lint in a cardboard egg carton if you want to make a fire starter that takes longer to burn.
