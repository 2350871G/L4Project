          "description":"Choose one of your favorite anime characters or one that is well known. Or, you may want to pick an anime character because they have a costume you\u2019d like to replicate. Each anime character tends to have multiple stand-out features or accessories you can imitate. Examples of popular male anime characters are L, Edward ELRIC and Kakashi Hatake. For L, you could wear a thick, black wig and carry a magnifying glass and/or sweets (L is a detective with a sweet tooth). To dress as Edward ELRIC, wear a shaggy blonde wig and carry alchemist accessories. For a Kakashi Hatake costume, wear a spiky gray wig, a headband, and a vest. Examples of popular female anime characters are: Asuna, Mirajane Strauss, and Akame. To dress like Asuna, wear long, light blue hair, fake elf ears and a white outfit. To resemble Mirajane Strauss, wear a long, whitish blonde wig with a side part, and blue contacts. For an Akame costume, wear a black wig that is long in the back and short in the front. Wear red contacts."
