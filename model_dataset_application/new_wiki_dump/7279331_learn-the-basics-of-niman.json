Although you (probably) can't use the Force in real life, you can still try stuff like pulling and shoving (or kicking - no big heavy boots please!) your opponents. The main two Niman Force attacks are:\nPushing slash - slash your opponent, then shove them away with the Force while they're disoriented. Draw closer - pull your opponent into range with the Force, then hit them with your lightsaber."
