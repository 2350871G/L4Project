(Don't lick the spoon if you don't want the bitter plain crema taste.) Sip the crema for a bitter blast to start out. Some people then stir the remaining crema in, but more proceed to drink the rest with the crema still separated. Skim the crema off and discard. This option may horrify traditionalists, but even some chefs prefer the sweeter, lighter, more evenly textured drink that results."

Drinking the shot in one or two swallows is worth trying at least once to see how the flavor changes, but expect an extremely intense punch. Test the temperature of the drink before trying this.

Cooling will alter the espresso's flavors, or make different notes more noticeable, but this is almost always a negative effect once the drink drops near room temperature. Try stirring and sipping an espresso doppio, or double-sized shot, for a different balance of top and bottom layers."

          "description":"Espresso is made by forcing hot, high-pressure water through freshly-ground coffee beans, yielding a small amount of liquid, about \u00be to 1 \u00bd oz liquid. A proper espresso is made from coffee beans that have been roasted medium-dark or darker, ground to a fine consistency, and packed evenly into an espresso basket. While there is an endless variety of espresso preferences and traditions, these basic properties define the drink. If your drink fills an ordinary coffee cup, was made from coarse-ground beans, or went through an ordinary coffee filter, it is not a typical espresso. An \"espresso macchiato\" adds a small amount of milk or milk foam atop the drink."

This \"crema\" is a rapidly evaporating compound of coffee oils and solids, not found in any other coffee drink. Thicker, redder crema, with flecks of copper or dark gold, suggests the espresso was \"pulled\" perfectly. The crema dissolves quickly after creation, so an espresso served without a crema may have sat out a couple minutes, or may not have achieved enough pressure."

If it has a one-dimensional bitter flavor, the beans may have been roasted too dark. Try another caf\u00e9 or homemade method, and you'll find a different interpretation of espresso."

Espresso is made by forcing hot, high-pressure water through freshly-ground coffee beans, yielding a small amount of liquid, about \u00be to 1 \u00bd oz liquid. A proper espresso is made from coffee beans that have been roasted medium-dark or darker, ground to a fine consistency, and packed evenly into an espresso basket.

If your drink fills an ordinary coffee cup, was made from coarse-ground beans, or went through an ordinary coffee filter, it is not a typical espresso. An \"espresso macchiato\" adds a small amount of milk or milk foam atop the drink. Watch the color and thickness of the crema. A light brown, frothy layer tops the surface of a properly made espresso. This \"crema\" is a rapidly evaporating compound of coffee oils and solids, not found in any other coffee drink. Thicker, redder crema, with flecks of copper or dark gold, suggests the espresso was \"pulled\" perfectly. The crema dissolves quickly after creation, so an espresso served without a crema may have sat out a couple minutes, or may not have achieved enough pressure.
