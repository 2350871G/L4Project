Keep mixing and smashing until the fats are the size of peas.Variation: You can make the dough in a food processor. Put all of the ingredients into the processor and pulse the mixture 8 to 12 times. Keep the butter and shortening as cold as possible so the heat from your fingers doesn't melt them. This will help the pastry become flaky."

You should see the flour begin to clump together as it becomes moist. If the mixture looks too dry to hold together, stir in the remaining \u20444 cup (59 ml) of ice water a few spoonfuls at a time. If you're making the dough in a food processor, keep the machine running and pour 1/2 of the water into the feed tube. Then mix in the rest of the water as needed."

Assembling and Baking the Pot Pie Preheat the oven to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C) and get out the dough. Take the chilled ball of pastry dough out of the refrigerator and unwrap it. Set the dough on a floured surface so you can begin to roll it out.Tip: To save time, use storebought pastry dough that you simply lay in the deep-dish pie plate. Divide the dough in 1/2 and roll each piece into a 12 in (30 cm) circle. Use a knife to cut the dough in 1/2 and set 1 piece aside. Then use a rolling pin to roll out the first circle on your floured surface. Keep turning the dough to prevent it from sticking as you roll it into an even circle. You might want to flour your rolling pin occasionally if the dough sticks to the pin. Line a pie plate with the pastry and roll out the remaining dough. Get out a 9 in \u00d7 2 in (22.9 cm \u00d7 5.1 cm) deep-dish pie plate and carefully lay the rolled out circle of pastry dough in the bottom of the dish. The dough should come up and over the sides of the plate. Then roll the other piece of dough into another 12 in (30 cm) circle. If you don't have a deep-dish pie plate, use a 2 US qt (1.9 L) baking dish instead. Avoid using a shallow pie plate because the filling will overflow. Spread the turkey filling in the pie plate. Spoon the slightly cooled turkey filling into the pastry-lined pie plate. Use the back of a spoon to level the filling so the top layer of pastry will sit evenly on the filling. Lay the remaining pastry over the filling and pinch the edges to seal them. Carefully arrange the remaining circle of pastry dough over the filling in the pie plate. Then use your fingers to pinch the bottom layer of pastry with the top layer. Do this around the entire pie plate so the pastry is sealed. Pinching the edges will prevent the pastry from leaking out as the pot pie bakes. Cut 2 slits on the top of the pie and brush it with an egg wash. Take a sharp knife and cut 2 slits about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long through the top layer of pastry. This will allow steam to escape as the pie bakes. Then beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of water and brush the wash over the top of the pie. The egg wash will make the pot pie become golden brown as it bakes. If you don't want to use an egg wash, brush the pastry with whole milk or heavy cream instead. Bake the turkey pot pie for 35 minutes. Put the assembled turkey pot pie in the preheated oven and bake it until the crust becomes a rich brown color. You should see steam escaping from the slits you cut. If you're worried that the filling may bubble up and over the side of the pie plate, lay a sheet of aluminum foil or a baking sheet on the rack underneath the pie. Serve the turkey pot pie with a green salad. Turn off the oven and carefully remove the hot pot pie. Although you can cut and serve it immediately, it may be easier to serve if you wait a few minutes so the filling sets up a little. Consider serving the pot pie with a fresh green salad.
