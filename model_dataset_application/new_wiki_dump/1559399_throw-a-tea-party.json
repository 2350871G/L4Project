Weekend afternoons are great for tea parties, as most people are off from work and looking for leisurely activities. A tea party in the afternoon will also serve nicely as midday refreshment.

Use dishes sized for smaller portions (such as bread or salad plates) at each place settings, as afternoon tea should be light refreshment rather than a full meal.

Have the tea brewed, strained and heated in the kitchen to bring out once everyone is present and seated. You might also provide guests with separate infusers and have hot water ready so that they may each have their individual preference. Guests may be served tea in turn, or the components can be brought out and placed in the center of the table along with the food so that they have the opportunity to serve themselves at their leisure. Pair your teas with the food to enhance their enjoyment. For instance, foods like biscuits and cheeses with more uniform flavors will pair well with light and zesty teas, while rich, savory appetizers can be offset by complex blended teas.
