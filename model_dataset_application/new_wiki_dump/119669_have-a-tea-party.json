Try to keep the guest list to around eight people. Tea parties are supposed to be cozy, so the tea party host can easily mingle with each of her special guests.

You will want to serve something light, like cucumber sandwiches, but you also want to serve something sweet, like cranberry scones or fruitcake. You can also serve things like teacakes and buns. Some common types of sandwiches served as tea parties are salmon club, crab, smoked salmon and avocado, and carrot and raisin. A few classic scone flavors are lemon drizzle, walnut, and cherry. Cookies and cakes are also nice to have out after sandwiches are served. Put jams out to pair with the scones. Strawberry, rhubarb and ginger, and jumbleberry are some options for jam flavors."
