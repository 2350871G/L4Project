Scrub the shells of the clams and mussels to remove any excess sand. Rinse 18 small red potatoes, remove the skin from 6 medium onions and take off the silk from 6 ears of corn, but do not remove the corn husks. Replace the husks over the corn after removing the silk. Dig a hole that is 6 by 4 feet (1.8 by 1.2 m) and 2 feet (0.6 m) deep. Line the hole with rocks that are about the size of grapefruits. Build a fire in the hole you have dug, adding logs every 15 minutes for about 2 hours. After the first 45 minutes, put 20 more rocks onto the fire. After 2 hours, move the rocks to the sides with a shovel and leave the coal about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick on top of and between the rocks. Remove and extinguish any excess coals. Puncture the bottom of 6 disposable aluminum pans with a screwdriver, making the holes about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart.
