If you don\u2019t already have blinds or curtains in the room, invest in some, especially if you have any south or west-facing windows. By using window coverings, you can reduce indoor temperatures by up to 20 degrees. Try to keep the window coverings closed from morning until late afternoon when the sun is at its peak. If heat is a persistent problem in the room, consider purchasing thermal insulated blackout curtains."

Computers and televisions, in particular, generate a lot of heat. Incandescent lightbulbs are big heat-generators, too. If possible, turn the lights off in the room. It's not always feasible to turn out all the lights. At the very least, dim them as much as you can. Consider replacing your incandescent lights with compact fluorescent lamps, or better yet, light-emitting diodes which generate far less heat. CFLs and LEDs are more environmentally-friendly, as well."

The less clutter you have in the room, the more available space there is for the heat to disperse and the faster it will cool down. A lot of clutter can also restrict airflow, making it feel even hotter in the room. Toss any piles of clothing you have on the floor into your closet and shut the door behind them. Do a quick survey of the remaining clutter and quickly eliminate what you can."

Remove this trapped heat and push it outdoors by opening the windows in the room. Close off any spaces in the house that you currently aren\u2019t using, too. This will help to cool down the room you\u2019re in more quickly. Once it cools off a bit, be sure to close the windows."
