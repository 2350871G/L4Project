          "description":"If the stucco has been applied recently, it needs to have a chance to dry and settle before you begin making any improvements. That way, you can ensure that it will be structurally stable by the time you\u2019re ready to paint over it. Avoid touching the stucco as it dries. Your installer may choose to keep a protective scaffolding up over the wet surface during this time. Environmental moisture can slow down the drying process. Consider waiting an additional 1-2 weeks if you live in an area that receives a lot of rainfall."

          "headline":"Inspect the stucco for imperfections.",
          "description":"Make a mental note of any areas that are stained, crumbling, or peeling. It\u2019s important to be aware of these spots, as they\u2019ll likely require extra attention when you start painting. If the stained or crumbling section isn\u2019t readily obvious, mark it with a piece of colored painter\u2019s tape so you\u2019ll be able to find it easily later on."

        {
          "headline":"Repair any existing cracks or holes in the surface.",
          "description":"Fill small hairline cracks with elastomeric caulk by running the tip of a loaded caulk gun along the length of the crack while slowly releasing the caulk. For larger spots, you may need to use a thick stucco or concrete patching compound. These products are designed to hold more firmly and last longer than silicone fillers. Use a hand trowel or putty knife to smooth the fresh patching compound until it matches the texture of the surrounding surface. If you run into any heavily damaged areas, you may need to fix them by applying a new layer of stucco. Contact the original installer to see what course of action they recommend."

        {
          "headline":"Pressure-wash the stucco 15-30 days after making your repairs.",
          "description":"Spray the surface from one end to the other, working your way from top to bottom. This will remove whatever dust, dirt, grime, or mold has built up on the textured material over time. It will also blast away any loose paint left over from previous touch ups. To avoid chipping or wearing away the stucco, set your pressure washer to a low pressure setting (1,200-1,500 psi will be ideal for most surface) and use a wide spray tip. Be sure to angle the nozzle away from windows, door frames, light fixtures, and any other features that may be damaged by the stream."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Allow the stucco to dry completely.",
          "description":"This may take hours or days, depending on the weather conditions where you live and how much area you covered with the pressure washer. Stucco is a porous material, which allows it to dry quickly, but it also holds more moisture as a result. Once no more water is visible on the surface, perform a touch test to see if it\u2019s still wet. If the stucco feels slightly tacky or cool to the touch, it probably needs more time."

For instance, flexible acrylic paints expand and contract to adjust to drastic temperature changes, while paints with dirt and mildew-resistant additives will cut down on regular cleaning and maintenance. You can find masonry paint at any hardware store or home improvement center, or in the paint aisle of superstores like Walmart. Stucco has a far greater surface area than smoother finishing materials. For this reason, it's a good idea to pick up extra paint just to be on the safe side. If a bucket promises 400 square feet (37 m) of cover, you may only get 200 square feet (19 m)\nIt's not typically necessary to use a separate primer, as stucco is a porous material that holds paint well."

Having a buffer in place will allow you to work quickly and efficiently and prevent paint from ending up where it\u2019s not supposed to be. If you\u2019re painting a surface that\u2019s partially indoors or alongside a paved walkway, it's also a good idea to stretch out a dropcloth or tarp to protect the ground from drips and spills.

A lambswool roller is ideal, as it will hold its shape throughout prolonged paint jobs while cutting down on messy drips and splatters. If the surface you\u2019re painting is relatively smooth, a roller with a 0.5 in (1.3 cm) nap thickness should do the trick. For rougher surfaces, switch to a 0.75\u20131 in (1.9\u20132.5 cm) roller to help the paint penetrate deeper pores."

The thin, flexible bristles will help work the color into the smallest pores, crevices, and other hard-to-reach spots. Your masonry brush will also come in handy for touching up border areas that you were unable to reach with your roller. A 4 in (10 cm) brush will offer the best balance of coverage and maneuverability for most jobs."

If you think the coverage could be better or the color a bit bolder, you can proceed with a follow-up coat. Roll this coat on the same way you did the first, changing up the direction of your strokes until you\u2019ve covered the whole surface. Don't slather the paint on too heavily, or you could end up covering the surface\u2019s natural texture. Two thin coats tends to look better than one thick one."
