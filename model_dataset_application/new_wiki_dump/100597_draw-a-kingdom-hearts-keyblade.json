Draw an oval, a line going through the middle, then another oval (slightly larger) outside of the first one. When you color it in, you can add cool designs to the handle."

This gives room for decorative design. The 2 narrow lines will be colored in, but in the wider lines, you can do designs, patterns, or ribbon strips going off the sides. Get creative!"
