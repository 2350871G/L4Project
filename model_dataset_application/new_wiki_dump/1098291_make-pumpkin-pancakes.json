      "headline":"Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients.",
      "description":"Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredient bowl. Fold and combine thoroughly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until thick and creamy like pancake batter. The color should be a bright orange. Be careful not to overmix! Overmixing causes the pancakes to become rubbery and tough. It's okay to have a few lumps."

      "description":"Drizzle olive oil and/or salt on the skillet surface to prevent the pancakes from sticking to the pan. You can tell when the stove is preheated by flicking a few drops of butter or water on it and seeing if it sizzles."

      "headline":"Cook the pancakes.",
      "description":"Measure about \u00bc cup of pancake batter and slowly pour it on the skillet. Bubbles will form in the center and pop when the pancake has fully cooked. Flip each pancake when it has cooked on the first side. When the pancake has finished cooking, put it on a plate and keep it warm in the oven on low. Continue cooking until you've used all the pancake batter."
