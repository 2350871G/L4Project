          "description":"Most pieces of furniture are made to fit a common standard size, so it is likely that you will be able to find a slipcover that will fit your furniture by shopping in a store or online. If you cannot find a slipcover in the exact size you need, look into a stretch slipcover. Stretch slipcovers are made with stretchy materials that can fit a range of different furniture sizes. You may want to look into the company that produced your piece of furniture. Many companies that make and sell furniture also sell slipcovers that are made exactly to the specifications of their furniture, making the process of choosing a slipcover quite simple. Before choosing a slipcover, it is helpful for you to be aware of all your options so that you can determine your budget and decide which company you want to order from."

          "description":"Examine the shape of the seat, arms, legs, cushions, and back of your furniture to determine the type of slipcover you will need. Most slipcovers are made to fit rounded arm and back furniture, but there are many available that will fit other shapes as well. Determine whether you want or need a slipcover that is one continuous piece of fabric, or if you will need or want separate sets to cover individual pieces or cushions. Separate sets can mimic the appearance of an upholstered or non-slipcovered piece of furniture, giving a cleaner and higher quality look."
        },

          "headline":"Take measurements to determine the correct slipcover size.",
          "description":"First, measure the width from the outside edge of one side to the outside edge of the other side. Then, measure from the outside edge of the front to the outside edge of the back. Next, measure the width and length of any arms. Finally, measure the length and width of any cushions, backs, or any other part of the furniture that needs to be covered by the slipcover. Write down these measurements as you go along. If your furniture has separate cushions and you have chosen to order a slipcover with separate sets, you will also need to measure each individual cushion from front to back, side to side, and top to bottom to determine the width. Make sure that you measure your furniture correctly and record each measurement as you go."

          "headline":"Decide on the slipcover material.",
          "description":"Go with cotton, canvas, denim, and twill if you need something durable and machine-washable. These medium weight fabrics will likely form a loose but clean fit around your furniture. If you want your slipcover to have a tighter fit around your furniture, choose a polyester, micro-suede, or spandex blend. Select a fabric that suits the furniture style, your lifestyle, and personal taste. Find a fabric in a color and pattern that you like while taking into consideration how you plan to use the furniture."

Custom-made slipcovers tend to cost more than a store-bought slipcover, so it is important that you decide on a budget before selecting your fabric and ordering your slipcover. Custom-made slipcovers are a good option for furniture that is oddly shaped, or if you are particular about the design.

While you can find fabric online, it might be safer for you to go to a fabric store to select your custom slipcover fabric. It is difficult to determine the texture, weight, and accurate colors when shopping online, all of which are important when selecting the right fabric. If you do decide to order online, see if the company will send you a small sample first so that you can make sure the fabric is to your liking. Medium weight fabrics like cotton, canvas, and denim are all good options because they are machine washable, durable, and will easily conform to the shape of your furniture. Take into consideration the amount of use this piece of furniture will get. If you are covering your everyday couch, for example, you will want to choose a more durable fabric that can withstand more wear and tear. Lighter weight and more delicate fabrics like linen and silk might look nice, but neither are durable and both have to be dry-cleaned."
