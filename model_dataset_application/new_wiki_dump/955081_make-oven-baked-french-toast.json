This is the base for your filling and you can now experiment with different flavors to mix in. Try adding 1/4 cup sliced strawberries and 1 teaspoon vanilla essence to the cheese mixture. 1/4 cup apricot preserves and 3-4 pieces of finely chopped glace ginger is also very nice. 1/4 cup blueberries and the zest of one lemon would be good as well. You could also make the filling savory by adding mushrooms, spring onions, and ham or bacon.
