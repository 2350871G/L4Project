      "description":"Even if you sail it on a mill pond somehow water will try to get inside. There will probably be one or more openings in the deck which you will need to get into the innards for adjustment and things like battery charging. Build a wall (coaming is the technical term) around the opening about 10 inch (25.4 cm) high, making sure it is well sealed (using glue) to the deck. Then fit a hatch cover that is a good fit over the coaming. The way to do this is first cut some thin card eg from an old Xmas card and tape it round the outside of the coaming. Cut walls for the hatch and glue them to each other at the corners while fitting around the coaming. Fit a top onto the walls. When the glue is dry remove the hatch and carefully release the card if that got stuck too. That way you can get a tight fit with just a gap equal to the thin card."
