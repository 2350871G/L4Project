  "text":" Putting Your Xbox in Range Find your router and Xbox. If you\u2019re using a wireless connection, you\u2019ve connected your Xbox to your router, which is the device broadcasting Wi-Fi into your home. It\u2019ll be connected to your modem, which is what brings the internet connection into your home. If you know your internet connection is already working with your other devices, this will be most helpful for you. Navigate to the My Xbox utility and select \"System Settings\" from the menu.  Text your connection. Choose the option to test your Xbox Live connection when prompted and note the number of bars. With 3 or 4, your connection is good enough to not troubleshoot it. One or two bars indicate poor signal strength, and you should continue. Check the location of your modem or router. Make sure both the router and the Xbox are off the ground, away from walls, and relatively unobstructed. They should be in the same room. Relocate the devices. For the best connection, place the Xbox and the router next to each other or at least insure there is nothing between the two - draw a line of sight between the two. Be sure there is nothing electronic between the two at any point. Stopping Interference From Other Devices Disconnect other Internet-capable devices. For the best connection, make sure the Xbox is the only thing using the internet. Temporarily disconnect any computers or smartphones from your Wi-Fi. Disconnect third-party headsets.Third party headsets can interfere with wireless routers. Disconnect the power from the base station of the wireless headset rather than just turning off the headset. Move electronics away. Electronics, even things like microwaves, can interfere if placed between the Xbox and the router. Though there should ideally be nothing between the two, make sure there\u2019s nothing electronic. Connecting to the Router With a Wired Connection Obtain an ethernet cable. They\u2019re available fairly cheaply online, or for a bit more at any electronics store. You\u2019ll use this to connect your Xbox and your router, which is the device that broadcasts internet to your devices wirelessly. It may be the same device as your modem, which brings internet into your house. Plug one end of the ethernet cable into the Xbox.  Plug the other end of the ethernet cable into your router.  Restart both devices. Leave your router turned off for a few moments - maybe go grab a glass of water, just to be safe. Wait until all the lights you normally see on your router are on. Turn on your Xbox. When it\u2019s turned on, it should be already connected without any configuration of the devices. Trying a Direct-to-Modem Connection Unplug any cable connecting your router to your Xbox. If you need another ethernet cable, you can find one easily online or at any electronics store. Your modem is the device that brings an internet connection into your home. Many routers do not broadcast as fast as the modem they're hooked up to, which can hamper connection speeds. Unplug the cable connecting the modem to the router, if you need to. You may have enough space to plug both your Xbox and router into the modem. Plug the Xbox directly to the modem.  Unplug your modem from the power source. Wait at least one minute. You could take a small break, just to be safe. Plug the modem back in and wait for all the lights to return to their normal state.  Turn the Xbox back on. The devices should be connected without any additional configuration. Troubleshooting Your Internet Speed Verify your internet speed.The problem may simply be that your internet connection is not fast enough for online gaming. You can check your speed at Speedtest.net or any other site that comes up from searching \u201cinternet speed test\u201d in any search engine. These websites are fairly straightforward, but if you need additional help, checking your internet speed, try our article. Get the results.
