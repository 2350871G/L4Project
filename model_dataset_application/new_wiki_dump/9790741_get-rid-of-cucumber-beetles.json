When planted with crops like corn and broccoli, cucumbers aren't as attractive to the beetles. Plant the cucumbers in rows with corn and broccoli, planting cucumber every third plant. You can also add corn and broccoli between rows of cucumber. Make sure you're still leaving enough space for each plant to grow. Other plants you can try include radish, buckwheat, and sweet clover."

Basically, you're sacrificing the plant near the exterior to save your cucumber plants, which is called using a trap plant. You can also treat the trap plant with insecticides to help rid your garden of the beetles. You can also plant other varieties of winter squashes in the Cucurbita maxima family, such as turban squash. Zucchini are also tasty to these beetles."

However, wolf spiders like to hide in the straw, and they will eat the beetles as they pass through. Sprinkle the mulch in a layer that's about 1-inch (2.5-cm) thick around the young plants, leaving 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) around the plant on all sides.

By and large, though, if you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone. Wolf spiders are venomous, but they usually just cause some redness and swelling when they bite you.

Start with 1,500 ladybugs for a typical home garden, though you won't harm your garden by releasing too many. Many organic garden stores sell ladybugs to release in your garden. Place the ladybugs in your refrigerator when you buy them, which will slow them down a little. Spray down your yard thoroughly, and release the ladybugs in the evening.

Pick a cloudy day to spray so the water doesn't magnify the sun, burning the leaves. After a heavy rain, check to see if you need to reapply the mixture. Kaolin clay is even safe to spray on the cucumbers. Just wash it off before eating the vegetable. It's also good for other pests, such as grasshoppers, squash bugs, and other beetles so consider applying it to other plants.
