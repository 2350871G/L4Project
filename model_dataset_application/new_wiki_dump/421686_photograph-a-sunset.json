      "description":"You never know when the best and most beautiful light is going to happen, but it usually happens in a one-minute window, which can be any time within 15 minutes before and after sunset (this, plus the half-hour window at sunrise, is what the folks in Hollywood call \"magic hour\"). Consequently, you want to be on location at least half an hour before the sun sets, to give you time to look around and set up."

      "description":"Alternatively, don't, and skip the technical trivia below if it bores you; some proficiency with these things is useful, but not essential. More important is being out there at the right time. With that said... Play with exposure compensation (the feature of your camera that makes pictures lighter or darker). You want to make sure that you don't end up with large parts of your sky blown out to pure white. Remember, on digital cameras, you can always recover from all but the most terminal underexposure. Set your ISO to its lowest setting on digital cameras. The sky at sunset is still bright enough that you can get away with doing this. It'll also give you much more latitude for correcting underexposure, as per the above (since doing this in post-processing inevitably brings out any noise present). Don't increase it unless you have to. Set your white balance; again, this only applies to digital cameras. Many cameras do a reasonable job of this in \"Auto\". Others don't; they may see too much red in your scene and try to balance it out (which is not what you want -- the whole point of being out there is to capture these great colours). \"Daylight\" or \"shade\" settings are a good bet, but you'll doubtless want to experiment with this. Every camera is different, and some are much smarter than others. Which brings us around to the last point. Get to know your camera. Few cameras will get a perfect exposure all the time, and many will require tweaking every time. Some cameras are smarter about photographing sunsets than others. Many will require some degree of exposure compensation. If you're using center-weighted or spot metering,  you may find it useful to meter on one of the brighter (but not the brightest) parts of the sky, use your auto-exposure lock, and then recompose."

There are an infinite number of angles, locations, and compositions you can play with; some ideas, if you're out of them, follow below. Use reflections off bodies of water, if you're near one.
