Pok\u00e9mon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald - You can trade Shards to the Diving Treasure Hunter for the stones. You can also find a Water Stone at the Abandoned Ship, a Thunder Stone in New Mauville, and a Fire Stone at the Fiery Path. Pok\u00e9mon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum - Stones can be found by mining in the Underground. In Platinum, they can also be found in the Solaceon Ruins. Pok\u00e9mon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2 - Stones can be found in Dust Clouds in caves, and in a variety of shopping locations depending on the version you are playing. Pok\u00e9mon X and Y - Stones can be purchased in Lumiose City from  the Stone Emporium, earned through Secret Super Training, or won from defeating Inver on Route 18.

Getting your Eevee groomed will give you a large friendship bonus. Leveling up Eevee gives it a good bonus each time. Every 512 steps (Gen II), 256 steps (Gen III and IV), or 128 steps (Gen V and VI) will give you a small friendship boost. Note that in Generation V and VI, the chance that you will get the friendship boost is 50%. Letting Eevee faint will decrease its friendship by 1.
