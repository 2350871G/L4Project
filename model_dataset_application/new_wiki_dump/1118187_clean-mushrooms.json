A quick rinse under the faucet will be sufficient for cleaning most small, smooth types of mushrooms, like the white, button and leaf varieties."

Shake the colander or turn the mushrooms by hand periodically to make sure that all mushrooms have been rinsed. This method will be sufficient for quickly cleaning most varieties of mushrooms, save for those that have been dehydrated. While rinsing mushrooms is sometimes frowned upon in culinary circles because it is thought to water down natural subtle flavors, recent culinary research has shown that rinsing mushrooms does little to increase their internal water content."

Use a sharp knife to slice off any part of the mushrooms that are still caked with dirt or have mold growing on them. Because of their high natural water content and the places that they grow, a little bit of mold is normal on most mushrooms. However, if the mushrooms are especially moldy, slimy or have a dry, withered appearance, they are likely past their prime and shouldn\u2019t be used."

Separate the mushrooms into a single flat layer rather than a pile to help them dry faster. They're now ready to be chopped and cooked!

Wiping mushrooms down by hand can be useful if the type of mushroom you're cleaning has a broader surface area that would make working with a colander difficult. This method works best on larger, smooth types such as porcini and portobellos that won\u2019t require you to clean dozens of individual mushrooms by hand. Many experienced chefs prefer wiping mushrooms to rinsing them, as they feel it better preserves the mushroom\u2019s flavor."

Wet the bristles of the brush and use small, delicate motions to clean the cap and stem of the mushroom. Mushrooms brushes have soft bristles and are designed specifically to scour dirt and grime from vegetables without damaging them. Should you decide to scrub mushrooms with a toothbrush, make sure it has never been used before and has bristles soft enough to work on the bodies of delicate mushrooms."

Soaking will work for any small to medium-sized mushrooms, but rougher types may need to also be wiped or scrubbed before soaking, as their porous surfaces tend to hold more sediment.

Keep a close watch on the mushrooms as they soak\u2014don\u2019t allow them to remain in the liquid for too long.

To do this, you must first strain out any sediment that has washed off of the mushrooms. Place a paper towel, coffee filter or cheesecloth over the opening of a container and pour the liquid from the soaking bowl into the new container. The dirt will be trapped by the filter and can then be disposed of. Repurposing the soaking liquid will work best if you\u2019ve used wine, oil or broth. Mushroom liquid can be frozen and stored to be used later in other dishes."
