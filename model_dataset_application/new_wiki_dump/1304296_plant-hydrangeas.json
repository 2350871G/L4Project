Hydrangeas do not usually require additional care, and often grow or bloom without difficulty. If your hydrangeas wilt or dry out, construct a shade to block the sun during the afternoon. You can also try using mulch. If the winter forecast predicts unusually cold or prolonged frost, or if you are planting in a lower than recommended hardiness zone (see above), you may need to provide winter protection for your hydrangeas."

Ask the previous owner of the hydrangeas to identify your hydrangea variety if you are not aware of its name.

Because acidity affects the hydrangea's ability to take in aluminum, which in turn affects the flower color, you can get a rough prediction of the flower color by measuring the soil pH. As a rule of thumb, a soil pH below 5.5 will likely result in blue flowers, and a soil pH of 7 and up will likely result in pink or red flowers. The effects of soil pH levels between 5.5 and 7 are difficult to predict. They may result in blue, pink, or purple flowers, or in a blotched blue and pink pattern."

Once every 10\u201314 days, Apply as much of this water as you would in a normal watering. Continue to measure the pH of the soil, and stop applying once it drops below 5.5 pH. Alternatively, you can also create blue blossoms by applying a fertilizer that is low in phosphorus and high in potassium. Look for a 25/5/30 fertilizer blend. You'll also want to avoid superphosphates and bone meal."

However, you can take precautions in advance to encourage pink blooms, or you can grow your plants in a pot. Avoid planting near driveways or walls, as some concrete mixes or mortars can leach aluminum into the soil. Apply a fertilizer that contains no aluminum, but high levels of phosphorus, which inhibits aluminum uptake. Look for a fertilizer that contains a 25-10-10 blend. Consider raising the pH by adding wood ash or crushed limestone to the soil, as this also makes aluminum uptake difficult. Avoid raising the pH higher than 6.4, or the plant may develop health problems."
