Don't get thrown by \"fd.\" This is just another abbreviation for farad.

For example, a capacitor labeled \"6000uF +50%/-70%\" could actually have a capacitance as high as 6000uF + (6000 * 0.5) = 9000uF, or as low as 6000 uF - (6000uF * 0.7) = 1800uF.

This is the maximum voltage the capacitor is designed to handle. 1 kV = 1,000 volts. See below if you suspect your capacitor uses a code for voltage (a single letter or one digit and one letter). If there is no symbol at all, reserve the cap for low-voltage circuits only. If you are building an AC circuit, look for a capacitor rated specifically for VAC.

Traditionally, this mark designates the - end on an aluminum electrolytic capacitor (which are usually shaped like tin cans).
