          "description":"Most weddings have a very specific color scheme, and those colors often lead the way when it comes to choosing the wedding cake details. If you\u2019re working with a specific color scheme, consider those colors for the cake, as well. This will unify the style elements of your big day and lend a sophisticated, well-curated air to the occasion. For instance, if your wedding colors are burgundy and cream, try a cake with buttercream frosting and burgundy rosettes as accents. Give your baker fabric swatches to make sure the colors are perfectly replicated."

          "headline":"Select an all-white cake.",
          "description":"A white on white cake looks elegant, traditional and classy. If you\u2019re concerned that the all-white option is too boring, think again! Jazz things up with unique embellishments, multiple tiers and non-traditional shapes. Since all-white matches everything, you can avoid stressing over matching the frosting identically to your d\u00e9cor elements. To spice things up, consider sophisticated embellishments like pearls, lace, piped embroidery, and fresh flowers. Consider nontraditional shapes like hexagons or ovals, or mixing up the tier heights to create a dynamic, unexpected look."

          "description":"Wedding cakes in silver and gold are popular with those aiming for an art deco or vintage Hollywood vibe. However, metallics are easily adaptable for almost any wedding style! For an opulent look, go for something highly stylized in all-gold or all-silver, with delicate details. Create a vintage feeling by taking it down a notch and using metallic colors with a slight patina. If a full-metallic cake is a bit much for you, try using a more neutral buttercream for most the cake, with highly stylized metallic embellishments, like patterns, baubles, or iridescent rosettes."

          "description":"In general, three tiers will serve 50 to 100 guests. If you plan to have 200 or more guests, opt for something in the five to six tier range. Tell your baker how many guests will be attending the wedding. This will help both of you define the size of the cake, as well as how many tiers it should have."

However, experimental or nontraditional shapes, like hexagons or ovals, can certainly look formal if the other elements are restrained. For instance, an all-white cake with a nontraditional shape can still look formal if the embellishments are minimal."

If you\u2019re planning a smaller, more intimate reception in a tasteful setting, don\u2019t choose an epic cake that dominates the room. Go with something refined, with three tiers or less, featuring elegant embellishments."

          "description":"It's easy to start choosing cake features without thinking about the price tag, but the little things can add up fast! The more complicated the cake is, the more it will cost. Molded shapes, elaborate tiers, intricate details and handmade embellishments will up the final price. Even pricing for icing can vary quite a bit. For instance, fondant icing is a lot more expensive than buttercream. Most bakers price cake by the slice; inquire about the cost of each detail and make your decisions carefully."

Novelty cakes with exceptional forms and colors such as cakes made to look like the newlyweds faces, desert islands, or castles, aren't considered to be formal, though they can be appealing and fun."

          "description":"If you only add embellishments to a single tier, this will draw eyes straight to that tier only. Unless this is your goal, make sure the cake looks balanced by spacing out the embellishments evenly among the tiers. For instance, if you're using sugared rosettes on a three tiered cake, ask your baker to create small \"mini bouquets\" of the flowers and cluster them evenly \u2013 one on the center of the top tier, one on the left side of the middle tier, and one on the right side of the bottom tier."

You can taste a variety of options and find out what special embellishments, like sugar flowers, actually taste like. Ask plenty of questions and review the baker's portfolio while you're there. Eat something light before attending the tasting. If you go in hungry, everything might taste better than usual!"

Consider the height, color, material and design of the stand when making your choice. For instance, a five-tiered cake on a tall, slender cake stand that matches the cake (or the accents) will create a far more impressive and formal look than setting it on something plain or ordinary-looking."
