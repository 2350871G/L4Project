Look for one of these abbreviations beneath the recycling symbol to identify plastic that may be considered food grade. If the PETE plastic may be food grade, it will have a number 1 in the center of the recycling symbol. PETE plastic is often used for products like peanut butter and jelly jars and salad dressing. The abbreviation LDPE will have a number 4 in the center of the symbol if it\u2019s possibly food grade plastic. LDPE is used for a variety of food items from bread and frozen food bags to squeezable mustard and honey bottles. The PP abbreviation will have a number 5 in the center of the recycling logo if it is potentially food grade. This type of plastic is commonly used for containers that hold ketchup, syrup, and yogurt."
