      "headline":"Pick a theme.",
      "description":"If you can't think of one, or don't like the idea of 'Hawaiian paradise' or 'pretty in pink', then pick 2 or 3 of your favorite colors and make that the theme. You could also pick a place to base it upon - Italy, Spain, England, France, etc. Have food from that place, get pictures, music, and more. Don't pick something that is aimed towards only a few friends. If you know a few of your friends hate make-overs and doing nails, stay clear of a spa party. Most of all, be creative. People will get more excited if the theme is something new that they haven't been to before. Can't pick just one? Than have an international party! Get your guests to bring something from their own heritage or let them choose whichever one they like. You can have games and name the teams stuff like: The Paris People, The English Muffins, The French Fries, The Italian Ice Cubes... Whatever you like!"

That way, the people who look up to you will get to spend some time with you, parents will be grateful, and you get some game testers for free! Same thing for food, make small portions to try to then you can serve them to little kids, your neighbors, or your parents."

Post them up on a board and plan where things will go, where you will put decorations, etc. It will help with the last-minute rush. If you are having the party at your house, do the same thing. Most people in your family won't appreciate their things being moved around a week beforehand."
