Building a shelf in the outhouse can provide a place for toilet paper and a few magazines and hand sanitizers.

There is no one rule for outhouses in the United States and even less so for the rest of the world. It is unlikely that you will be able to build one in the city. Research local code for the minimum distance between septic sources and water sources, plus any other restrictions on size or depth. Choose a design. There are many different types of outhouse designs, some of them simpler than others. Before building, decide how many seats you want, and whether you will separate stalls by sex.

They can either simply have a hole in the floor of the outhouse over which one squats, or they can have an actual seat to sit upon.

You can build directly on top of your foundation, or you can build it elsewhere and place it full completed on the foundation. The frame can be a simple square of four timbers, or use additional timbers for reinforcement. Use pressure-treated timbers or untreated hemlock, which has a natural resistance to decay.

Some people have a space created at the back of the privy with a sort of gate which they can open and rake out the refuse. This often requires that an outhouse is built into a hillside, or on a high foundation. Once you've raked it out, you will need to bury it somewhere on the property at least 30 feet (9.1 m) away from a water source or runoff. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/87\\/Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/87\\/Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nBy this point the contents of the outhouse will be more like fertilizer than anything else and you can use them, but only if you've been following the composting toilet guidelines. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3e\\/Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3e\\/Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nYou may have to dig the refuse out of the hole. To do this you'll need to dismantle the seat and use a manual post-hole auger or digger to remove the contents below. If you don't have an auger you can use a shovel, but the auger is the best tool and if you're going to have an outhouse is something that you should invest in. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/4a\\/Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/4a\\/Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nThe third option is to dig a new hole for the outhouse. You'll need to follow the directions above, but you already have the outhouse itself! {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/40\\/Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/40\\/Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-an-Outhouse-Step-11Bullet4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Grow flowers on the outside. Many old-time outhouses used to be covered by flowers to make them smell nice and give it an attractive appearance. There's no sustainable reason to do this except for attractive aesthetics.",
