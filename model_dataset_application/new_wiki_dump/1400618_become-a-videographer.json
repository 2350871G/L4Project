Seek out and take advantage of any courses and opportunities at your school that are related to working with film. Some high schools offer courses in technology, film, art, broadcasting, or journalism that might involve components relevant to videography. Take part in your school\u2019s news program, if it has one, as an opportunity to practice filming. Join or start a video or audio-visual (AV) club at your school.

While digital cameras and computer software are the state of the art, you might also gain some familiarity with other types of equipment and editing techniques. Get a digital camera and start filming whatever you find interesting. Using a computer and at least basic software, start learning how to edit your footage. Even if you just keep it for yourself, this will be good practice. Professional video equipment and software can be expensive, but if you are serious about becoming a videographer, it might be worth the investment."

          "description":"Videography is an art that involves much more that simply pointing a camera at something and shooting. By taking different kinds of shots, you can vary your work with a subject, making your footage more interesting and compelling to viewers. The extreme long shot (ELS) or extreme wide shot (EWS) covers a very wide area, placing your subject in context. For instance, if you are filming a wedding, you might include an EWS that shows the entire wedding party and audience, with the couple at the center. A long shot (LS), full shot (FS), or wide shot (WS) captures the entire subject within the camera frame. For instance, if you are recording a speaker, a FS will show the figure filling the screen, from head to toe. A medium long shot (MLS) or medium wide shot (MWS) or three-quarter shot is often used for filming people, and shows a subject from about the knees up. This kind of shot is useful for recording small groups of people, such as a group of bridesmaids chatting at a wedding. The medium shot (MS) shows individuals from the waist up. It focuses the viewer\u2019s attention on the subject, and is useful for filming interviews. It is useful for showing detail when filming other subjects. The medium close-up (MCS) shows a figure\u2019s shoulders and head. It is used for filming interviews and in contexts like news studios. The close up (CU) fills the camera\u2019s frame with the subject. It is useful for capturing emotion and facial expressions. The extreme close up (ECU) films just a part of a subject, such as a person's eyes. It can be used for very dramatic effects."

          "description":"A stationary camera pointed at a single subject can be simple and effective, but it can also get a little boring. To vary your projects and make them more interesting, try moving your camera in several ways, including:\nPanning, which involves turning the camera from left to right or right to left. This is useful, for instance, when filming a crowd or landscape. Tilting, which means moving the camera up or down to show parts of a subject that were off-screen. This move is useful when filming subjects like close-ups of people or buildings. Trucking and dollying, which involve physically moving a camera around or away from a subject, respectively. For instance, if you are filming a small group of people, you can truck a camera around the perimeter of the group to capture it from many angles. Likewise, if you want to film a sense of leaving a subject, like a building, dolly a camera pointed at the building away from it."

Common techniques include:\nZooming in and out\nFading in and out\nCutting (shifting the film from quickly one scene to another, such as from a shot of a bride with bridesmaids inside a church to a shot of the church viewed from the outside).

It focuses on capturing a subject from several different angles to create variety. You can then arrange the clips during the editing phase in whatever order seems good to you. Get one wide shot of a subject. For instance, when filming a speaker in front of a crowd, get a shot that shows the speaker as well as the whole crowd. Take a medium shot of the subject. For instance, you could zoom in on the speaker to show a stage and podium. Incorporate one close-up (\u201ctight\u201d) shot. For instance, get a close-up shot of the speaker\u2019s face during a particularly emotional or important moment. Make sure to hold each shot for at least ten seconds. You can remove sections you don't need during editing, but you can\u2019t add them if you never filmed them in the first place."

For instance:\nEdit a series of different shots together to create a story or narrative. Practice adding sound, text, and other elements to create interest and variety.

Include clips or full footage that you have shot, whether as a student, for a project, or as part of a job. Show this portfolio to studios, producers, and others you approach when looking for jobs. Include lots of different clips of things that you have shot and edited. If you want to show that you are a diverse videographer, make sure that your portfolio shares clips a variety of subjects. If you want to concentrate on a certain type of videography, such as for weddings, then make sure that your portfolio has a range of different clips from weddings you have filmed. Make sure to include clips of varying lengths. Some prospective clients might want to see 30 minutes of that wedding that you shot, while others might only have time to look at a 30-second clip. Create a website or channel on a video-sharing website to showcase your work. You can share the link to your portfolio, promote it on social media, etc. It is a good idea to have your portfolio in several formats. For instance, you might also create DVDs with samples of your best work to show to clients or job search committees that prefer that format.
