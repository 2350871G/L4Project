      "description":"In the retreat cost, you should see * symbols. Those represent how much energy is needed to be attached to that Pok\u00e9mon in order to retreat. For example: if there is one * symbol, you only need one energy card attached to that Pok\u00e9mon in order to retreat. You can attach any type of energy you want to the retreating Pok\u00e9mon. If there are no * symbols, then that Pok\u00e9mon doesn\u2019t need any energy in order to retreat; it can retreat anytime for free! Great examples are Electrode and Gengar, and Crobat, which all have the retreat of zero. Be aware, though, that you can only attach one energy card to a Pok\u00e9mon per turn."
