          "description":"Choose a tray that contrasts well with the material and color of your dining room table. You can place things on the tray such as candles, coasters, or small decorative objects. Trays are a great option as they let you pick up everything that's on the table at once. Opt for a lazy Susan in the middle of your table for a super functional tray. If you have a wooden table, you might opt for a marble tray, while a wooden tray looks great with a sleek metal table. Trays work for holding decorative items as well as for serving your table a meal."

          "description":"Choose a bowl that you like and that matches your dining room. Place fresh fruit in it, such as apples, oranges, bananas, or pears. This is a great way to store snacks while creating an aesthetically-pleasing centerpiece. It's best to choose a bowl that will display all of the fruit well, so avoid huge bowls unless you're going to fill them to the top with fruit. Pay attention to the ripeness of the fruit to make sure you replace it when necessary. Use plastic fruit as an alternative, if desired. Make sure to use a large, decorative bowl so it doesn't look like someone forgot to clean up their dishes."

Make sure all of your dishes are matching to keep the display looking nice. You can also do this with drinking glasses or bowls. Use colorful plates to add texture and colors to your table."

          "description":"A set of elegant candlesticks are a good option for your dining room table, as are a group of votive candles. You can light the candles when you're eating a meal, working at the table, or just want a fresh scent in the room. Place a large candlestick near each end of the table, or set out small votive candles along the entire center of the table. Try flameless, battery-operated candles if you don't want a fire risk in your home."

If you want to leave some of the tabletop on display, choose a table runner or placemats, or both. Neutral fabric coloured white, beige, grey, stone etc with textures compliment most rooms, you can make a statement with bold colours or patterns if you prefer. Table linens are very practical, protecting the table from spills during meals. Try using placemats on top of your tablecloth to add layers to your table. Put table runners the opposite direction of any placemats you have."

This will draw attention to the piece while leaving it super functional. Hang decorative lighting above the table for an added element. Make sure to clean and polish your table weekly to protect it from dust and scratches."

This is a great way to show off urns, vases, or other similar items that work well with your dining room. For example, use silver vases as a centerpiece, or set out decorative metal urns on the table. Place a layer or mat between the object and the table so it doesn't dent the surface."

Hardcover books that are often viewed as coffee table books are great options for placing on your dining room table. Choose books in similar sizes, or arrange the stack so that it goes from the smallest to the largest with the smallest books on top. Set a small decoration or flameless candle on top of the books for added decor."

This will bring naturalistic elements to your dining room, and putting the plant in a decorative pot that matches your room will bring the whole look together. Place 1-2 taller potted plants in the center of the table, or choose a group of shorter potted plants to spread down the middle. If you're using real plants, make sure you water them so that they stay green and healthy. Place a tray or other material under the pot to catch any water that leaks out so that you don't ruin your dining room table."

If you have a super long table, consider placing multiple pieces along the center. Choose art that's 3-dimensional so that it can be viewed from every angle."
