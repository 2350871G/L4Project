      "description":"One of the easiest ways to earn free skins in CS:GO is to just play the game. You get a loot drop after your first level-up each week. This is usually a drop containing skins. They will normally be low-end skins, but free skins nonetheless. You can get a new chance to earn skins through loot drops, each week."

      "headline":"Play on official or community servers.",
      "description":"In addition to loot drops from leveling up, you can also earn random loot drops by playing on official servers, or community servers with Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) enabled. These drops may contain skins, weapons, or other items. You can usually get up to 4 loot drops per week."

      "headline":"Trade with friends on Steam.",
      "description":"If you know of a friend that has a skin you want, you may be able to trade for it on Steam. Sometimes you can trade a number of low-end skins for a more valuable skin. Or you may even be able to convince a friend to donate you a couple of low-end skins. Use the following steps to make a trade offer with a friend on Steam:\nOpen the Steam app or website and sign in. Place the mouse cursor over your username at the top of the screen. Click Friends. Click a friend you want to send a trade offer to. Click More to the right of your friend's user profile. Click Offer a trade. Click and drag the items you want to trade from both inventories into the trade boxes. Click the box to confirm the trade contents. Click Make offer."

      "headline":"Earn rewards from loot sites.",
      "description":"Websites such as eloot.gg, clickloot.com, and swagbucks.com offer rewards for completing tasks such as watching video ads and completing surveys. Many of these sites allow you to log in with your Steam account and start earning rewards immediately. You can then exchange your rewards for CS:GO skins or possibly a Steam gift card which you can put towards CS:GO skins. Use these sites at your own risk. Some of the offers may be a little sketchy and/or contain viruses. It can also take a long time to earn anything of value."

      "description":"CS:GO is very popular in eSports and has a lot of websites that cater to online betting. Many of these websites offer free daily rewards or bonuses for signing up.
