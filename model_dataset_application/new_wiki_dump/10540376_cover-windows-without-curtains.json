          "description":"Blinds are a great substitute for curtains. If you'd like to try blinds, you'll first need to measure the width and height of your window. Then, purchase sets of blinds at a local home-improvement store. Begin the installation by hanging the brackets at the top corners of each window. Then, hang the head rail and attach the valence over it once the rail is in place. Blinds allow complete control over the amount of light that comes in. You can raise blinds during the day and lower them at night, and can also adjust the positioning of the slats to allow more or less daylight into your home.

They come in a variety of stained or painted colors, so can be customized to suit your d\u00e9cor. As with other types of blinds, they can be adjusted throughout the day (and night) to allow natural light or close of visibility. Do not install wooden blinds in the kitchen or bathroom, since the moisture could damage the wood."

They cannot be raised and lowered, since the slats are vertical. However, you can still adjust the slats to let in more or less light depending on the time of day. Installing traditional horizontal blinds in a tall, narrow window would be impractical and look odd."

          "description":"If you don't want your window coverings to block out too much ambient light, choose shades. Shades are typically made of soft cloth and can be raised or lowered during the day or night, respectively. They also allow more ambient light than blinds and come in a larger variety of styles. Purchase shades at any home-improvement store. Install honeycomb shades if you live in a cold climate. Honeycomb shades contain many small tubes of air that hold warm air and keep your home warm overnight. Try woven wood shades in rooms that receive overly bright sunlight. Woven shades are typically made from bamboo. They block a great deal of light, but can still be raised and lowered depending on how bright the room needs to be."

They\u2019re considered a sleek option and are typically custom-ordered for individual windows. Also order blackout Roman shades if you\u2019d like the option to shut out all light from a room. If you like the idea of fabric shades but don\u2019t have a formal room, try an opaque twill tight-weave shade."

Purchase pre-made faux stained glass windows at a hobby or craft-supply store. Depending on the window\u2019s location, either lean the faux stained glass up against it or attach the glass to the window frame with mirror hanging hardware. Or, you can make your own faux stained glass panes. You\u2019ll need to purchase a glass pane the same size as the window you\u2019re covering, and color it using stencils and glass paint.

Gallery glass is a liquid that you can apply directly to your windows that dries opaque but still lets in some natural light. Follow the directions to apply the gallery glass to your window, and add texture by running a toothpick through the material before it dries. Purchase gallery glass at a local art-supply store or hobby shop."

To apply it, stick the adhesive side of the insulation film directly onto the surface of the window. Then, blow hot air onto the film using a hair dryer. After 3-5 minutes, the film will shrink and fully adhere to the window. Purchase window insulation film at a local hardware store or any major home-improvement store. The package should clearly state how much glass the insulation film will cover."

Buy plantation shutters at any major home-improvement store. As with other shutter types, you can either install them yourself or ask the store to send a technician to install the shutters for you."

Buy plantation shutters at any major home-improvement store. As with other shutter types, you can either install them yourself or ask the store to send a technician to install the shutters for you. Covering the Window with Objects Mount a shelf in front of a window for partial coverage. A shelf is a great way to partially cover a window without blocking out natural light. Measure the width of your window, and buy a shelf that\u2019s about 4 inches (10 cm) wider at a local home-improvement store. Mount the shelf as directed in the instructions that come with the shelf. Then, decorate the shelf as you like: for example, add a few houseplants, a couple of books, and a decorative vase. As an added bonus, you\u2019ll increase the amount of storage space in your home. Hang a DIY valence made of draped fabric in front of the window. Drive 2 nails (or push pins) into the wall, 1 on each side of the top of your window. Tie a piece of twine or string between the nails. Then, hang 15\u201320 pieces of fabric over it. Each strip should be between 20\u201325 inches (51\u201364 cm) long. Use bandanas, scarves, or a leftover fabric garland. The valence will fully cover the top portion of your window but still allow some visibility and natural light. For a more refined-looking valence, hang a curtain rod over your window, and drape pieces of fabric over the rod. Place 3\u20135 tall potted plants in front of a window. While plants aren\u2019t technically a window covering, they\u2019re effective at partially blocking visibility while allowing in natural light. Try setting a few houseplants on the windowsill of a kitchen window. Or, if you want to cover a tall, narrow window (e.g., in a hall or entranceway), set a single tall houseplant directly in front of it. Purchase house plants at a plant nursery or gardening center.",
