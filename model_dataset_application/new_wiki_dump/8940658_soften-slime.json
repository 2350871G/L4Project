Make sure you only add a little bit of water if you don't want jiggly slime."

Place the slime in a bowl, and just drip the gel in. Use your fingers to fold the hand sanitizer into your slime until it's a desirable consistency. Bonus, now your slime will be bacteria-free and smell great (for a while, anyway). You can add more gel if it doesn't soften on the first try."

Just put a spoonful or two in a bowl (four or five pumps if your lotion comes with a pump). Throw the slime into a bowl with your lotion and poke it with your fingers. Once your slime is covered in the lotion, you can take it out and knead it until it's soft."

Add a spoonful or so at a time, and knead it in to soften it. Be sure you match the type of glue you add with the glue you made your slime with. For example, don't add white glue to clear slime."

High-five! You've fixed your slime. If it looks too runny at the end, add a dash of activator. Activator is just whatever you used to make the slime in the first place, such as half a teaspoon of Borax dissolved in a glass of water."
