Have your sketchpad and supplies handy so you can pause the video and practice as the instructor breaks it down. Peruse the comment section on videos because it\u2019s likely that other artists have left some tips and suggestions. Search for tutorials in any particular technique you want to learn. For instance, you might find some good lessons on composition, working with light, cubism, surrealism, or even creating 3-D effects. If you can think of it, the internet probably has it!"

This is a great option if you have a busy schedule because you can tackle each lesson at your own pace. You can buy instruction books online or at most large bookstores. If you rent an instruction book from your local library, don\u2019t draw in the book! Photocopy the practice pages so you can draw on those instead.

Peruse the forums for any particular style or material and don\u2019t be afraid to ask for advice! Deviant Art, Artist Daily, and Wetcanvas are great online communities with thousands of artists to connect with and learn from. For example, you might visit a new artist thread and post something like, \u201cI\u2019m trying to learn different techniques for blending oil paints.

          "description":"Take some time to think about which techniques you\u2019re really good at and which ones you can improve upon. Rate yourself on a scale of 1 to 10 for each of the following skills: realism, life drawing, portraits, imaginative or memory drawing, proportions, composition, human anatomy, color blending (or theory), and shading. Then, put extra effort into working things that you\u2019ve rated on the lower end of the scale. For example, if you\u2019re great at drawing geometric shapes but struggle with shading, spend more time practicing different shading techniques. Set a realistic goal for improving on particularly weak skills. For instance, you might say, \u201cI\u2019m going to devote at least 40 minutes of each sketching session to practicing shading faces.\u201d"

If you\u2019re a beginner, make an effort to practice for at least 30 minutes each day and gradually work your way up until you\u2019re practicing for an hour or longer. After dinner or before going to bed are good times to practice because it will help you unwind from the day. Keep a calendar and \u201cx\u201d off each day that you practice your art. Try to rack up as many days in a row as you can to form a good habit. Set daily or weekly goals for your art practice. For example, you might say, \u201cI\u2019m going to finish 1 charcoal sketch per week.\u201d"

For instance, you might place a vase, candle, and bowl of fruit onto a table in front of a checkered wall. When setting up a model, play with the composition by moving pieces around before you start working. Consider making interesting shadows by rearranging larger or taller items in reference to the light source.

Don't swear off cheaper materials altogether, just try to work with the best quality materials for what you\u2019re trying to do.
