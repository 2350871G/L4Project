      "description":"Mewtwo is a level 70 Pok\u00e9mon, and it knows Psychic, Aura Sphere, Barrier (raises its Defense), and Recover (restores half its HP). You will need Pok\u00e9mon stronger than Mewtwo. Get a Pok\u00e9mon that can Paralyze it, a Pok\u00e9mon that knows Sing, or any other Pok\u00e9mon that uses any other status condition. In this type of battle, you need more strategy than power. Do not use Toxic, Will O' Wisp, or any move that causes a HP-sapping status condition. This makes damage worsen every turn, and Mewtwo is going to faint quickly if you are not careful. When you are ready, advance. Paralysis is best, since this condition makes Mewtwo slower, easier to catch, and less likely to use moves."

      "description":"The Ultra Ball is ineffective, but 40 may work (this is not, however, guaranteed). Timer Balls are if there at least 30 turns. The Master Ball always works, unless you are trying to catch a trainer's Pok\u00e9mon-but you may need it later."

The cave entrance will be blocked until you become the Champion, by defeating Diantha."
