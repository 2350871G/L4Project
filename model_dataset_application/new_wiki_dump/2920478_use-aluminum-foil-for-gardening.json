  "text":" Protect Plants from Insects Tear several sheets of aluminum foil. Base the number of sheets on the square footage of planting beds in your yard/garden. Rip the sheets into \u00bd\u201d to 1\u201d long sheets. You want a few strips of foil for every few feet of mulch in your garden bed. Mix foil strips with mulch. If you haven\u2019t already laid the mulch, pour mulch into a wheelbarrow and then add foil. Use a hoe or gardening tool to mix the foil into the mulch. Scatter the mulch in the garden bed. Mingle the foil into the mulch, evenly scattering pieces throughout the garden bed. Add foil to mulch if the mulch has already been laid. Use a garden hoe to integrate foil into the previously laid mulch, scattering the foil thoroughly. Protect Trees from Rodents and Pests During the Winter Measure the base of tree trunks you\u2019d like to protect during the winter. Small pests/rodents will munch on tree trunks during the winter months. Measure the circumference of the tree trunk and height from the base , 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) from the ground. Tear sheets of foil according to your measurements. Double each measurement as you will be layering two sheets of foil around the tree trunk for protection. Wrap the base of the tree trunk with the first sheet of foil. Press foil against tree trunk so it adheres to the wood. Work your way upward as high as you plan to wrap the tree and then add your next layer, starting with the base of the tree.  Design a Sun Box for Plants Obtain a small cardboard box to house plants. A shoebox or another rectangular box would do the trick. Cut one of the long sides from the box. Using a box cutter would allow you to get the best angle on the box. Measure the sides and base of the box. Obtain not only the inside, but also measurements for the outside of the box. Rip sheets of foil based on your measurements and wrap box. Use tape to secure foil in place if necessary. Place plants inside box and locate near a sunny window.  Incubate Seedlings Procure a shoebox to hold seedlings and soil. Make sure the box is sturdy enough to hold moist soil and growing plants. Measure the base and sides of the box, allowing for two extra inches. You will line the shoe box with foil, which will protrude two inches above the sides and top. Cut aluminum foil to measurement sizes and line shoebox. Use tape and/or glue if necessary to make sure foil holds in place. Poke small drainage holes along the bottom of the shoebox. Be sure you poke through the foil. Fill the box halfway to the top with potting soil and add seeds. Embed seeds snuggly into the soil and moisten soil with water. Place box near a sunny window and allow the light to reflect on the sun box. The sun will encourage quicker growth. Finished. ",
