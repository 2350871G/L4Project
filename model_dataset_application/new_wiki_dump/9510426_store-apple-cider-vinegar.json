To filter out cloudiness, run the vinegar through a piece of clean muslin or even just a coffee filter."

You can filter it out if you want. However, excessive amounts of sediment could indicate the vinegar is changing, and you should probably toss it. If you're creating homemade vinegar, you should toss the batch if you notice mold on the top during the fermentation process."
