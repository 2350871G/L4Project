Using a drill bit of a slightly smaller diameter than your screw, drill straight into the bottom of each leg. Typically, the appropriate screws will be sold along with this type of pad. Place the grip pad on the bottom of each leg. Using a screwdriver, drive the screw through the center of the grip pad securely into the pilot hole. Some pieces of furniture have wheels. Usually, these wheels are equipped with locks to keep them from rolling. Make sure that these locks are engaged. If skidding and slipping persist, it is possible to place wheeled furniture directly onto grip pads as described in step four."
