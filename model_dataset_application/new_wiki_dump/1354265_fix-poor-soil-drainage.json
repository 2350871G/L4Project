Also take into consideration how light or heavy the rainfall is, which may affect how large the affected area is. Plant stakes or flags in the center of the area and/or its borders while it's still wet if you think you will lose sight of it once it dries. For example, say you have a spot roughly ten square meters that has standing water after a day of average rainfall. Then say that, after a heavy rainfall lasting three days or more, the area expands to twenty square meters. In this instance, the problem area is probably still the original ten square meters, since the surrounding area usually doesn\u2019t experience standing water."

Next, check if the water is runoff from an impervious surface, like a driveway or patio, that\u2019s close at hand. Finally, check the lawn\u2019s surface to see if the affected area is noticeably lower than the surrounding area.

Do the same with a second stake 100 feet (30.5 m) away from the house, with the affected area in between. Then:\nTie a string around the first stake where it meets the ground. Then tie the other end to the second stake, using a level to determine how high up to make your knot, in order to keep the string perfectly horizontal. Go along the length of the string and measure its height off the ground to see how much it drops as you move away from the house. Ideally, your lawn should drop off a couple of inches (5 cm) every ten feet (3 m) from your house. If the ground rises again as you move away from the house, this may be part of your drainage problem."

Fill the depression almost all the way, with about 2 inches (5 cm) to spare. Fill the last two inches by laying sod so its roots prevent the soil from washing away.

Make sure you place your drains where the ground slopes away from your house so you don\u2019t create a new problem while solving the old one.
