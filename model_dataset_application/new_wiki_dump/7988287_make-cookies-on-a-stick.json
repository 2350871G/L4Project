You can make a basic sugar cookie cutout dough from scratch, buy a sugar cookie cutout dough mix, or buy some premade sugar cookie cutout dough in the refrigerated section of the grocery store. Prepare the dough according to the recipe or package instructions before you get started. It is best to use cold dough because it will hold its shape better when you cut it out. Make sure that you refrigerate your dough for at least an hour before you use it. You will probably need to preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. This is a common temperature for many cookie recipes. However, it is important to check the cookie recipe or cookie dough package before you set the temperature on your oven."
