      "description":"If you\u2019re going to try panning for the first time you should approach it with an experimental attitude. It can be a lot of fun but can also be quite frustrating. If you\u2019re at a special event where you have fast moving subjects (like a car race etc) you\u2019ll probably want to mix up your style of shooting. Don\u2019t just use this technique all day \u2013 instead also shoot some shots at fast shutter speeds. This way you\u2019ll end up with a variety of shots and will probably end up with some useful ones instead of just having a collection of blurry unusable ones."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Shutter speed.",
      "description":"Select a slightly slower shutter speed than you normally would. Start with 1/30 second and then play around with slower ones. Depending upon the light and the speed of your subject you could end up using anything between 1/60 and 1/8 \u2013 although at the slower end you\u2019ll probably end up with camera shake on top of your motion blur."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Location.",
      "description":"Position yourself in a place where your view of the subject will not be obstructed by anyone or anything else. Also consider the background of your shot. While it will be blurred if there are distracting shapes or colors it could prove to be distracting. Single coloured or plain backgrounds tend to work best."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Moving with the subject.",
      "description":"As the subject approaches track it smoothly with your camera. For extra support of your camera if you\u2019re using a longer lens or are feeling a little jittery you might like to use a monopod or tripod with a swivelling head.For best results you\u2019ll probably find that setting yourself up so that you\u2019re parallel to the path of your object (this will help with focusing)."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Automatic Focus:",
      "description":"If you have a camera with automatic focus tracking you can let the camera do the focusing for you by half pressing the shutter button (depending upon it\u2019s speed and whether it can keep up with the subject) If your camera doesn\u2019t have fast enough auto focusing you\u2019ll need to pre-focus your camera upon the spot that you\u2019ll end up releasing the shutter."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Release the shutter.",
      "description":"Once you\u2019ve released the shutter (do it as gently as possible to reduce camera shake) continue to pan with the subject, even after you\u2019ve heard the shot is complete. This smooth follow through will ensure the motion blur is smooth from start to finish in your shot."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Shutter Lag.",
      "description":"If you have an older digital camera or one that is of a more entry level point and shoot variety you could also have to contend with the dreaded \u2019shutter lag\u2019 problem. Shutter lag is when there is a slight delay from when you press the shutter to when the picture is actually taken. If you experience shutter lag you\u2019ll need to learn to anticipate the moment to take the shot and will definitely need to continue to pan well after you\u2019ve taken the shot."
    },
    {
      "headline":"With Flash.",
      "description":"There are no rules with panning and you might also like to experiment with using your flash while panning. This will only work if the subject is close enough or your flash is powerful enough to have an impact \u2013 but will help to further freeze your main subject while giving the background the motion blur you\u2019re after. If you do use a flash you\u2019ll want to test a variety of settings to get it looking right. In some cases you\u2019ll probably need to pull back the strength of your flash by a half or a third."
