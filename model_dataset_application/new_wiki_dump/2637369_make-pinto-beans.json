Remove any debris that you spot before transferring the beans to a large pot or bowl\nYou only need to rinse the beans for 30 to 60 seconds. The main purpose of this rinse is to stir up and loosen any major pieces of debris. Debris usually appears in the form of small stones. You do not have to examine the beans too carefully during this process, especially if you purchased them from a trusted source, but you should keep your eyes open for anything that looks out of place."

You can use a refrigerator, but a secluded corner of the kitchen counter will work just as well if not better. Soaking the beans softens them, thereby creating a shorter cooking time while preserving as many nutrients as possible. The process also helps clean them and removes indigestible, gas-creating sugars known as oligosaccharides"

The dirt and oligosaccharides will have seeped into the water the beans soaked in, making it unsuitable for use as a cooking liquid. Rinsing the beans also makes them cleaner and safer to eat. If you plan on reusing the pot you soaked the beans in to cook the beans, give the pot a quick rinse, as well."
