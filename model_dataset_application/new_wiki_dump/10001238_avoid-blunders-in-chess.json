          "description":"If you\u2019re new to chess, take some time to learn about the various pieces and their unique patterns of movement. Knowing their strengths and weaknesses will enable you to use them more effectively while avoiding careless errors and oversights. Each player has a total of 8 small pawns. Pawns can only move forward a single space at a time, never backwards or sideways. They capture enemy pieces diagonally. The 2 crowned rooks on either end of the board can move and capture forward or sideways any number of spaces, making them quite useful. There are 2 horse-shaped knights, which move and capture in an L-shaped pattern, either forward 2 spaces and over 1, or forward 1 space and over 2. The 2 bishops stationed between the rooks and knights can move and capture any number of spaces diagonally. When used together with the rooks, they can be very effective both offensively and defensively. The queen is the most powerful piece on the board, as it can move an unlimited number of spaces forward and backward, sideways, or diagonally. Because your queen is so versatile, you should avoid losing it at all costs. The king is the most important piece in chess, and the one the game is centered around protecting. It can move a single space in any direction. Consider each piece\u2019s unique pattern of movement when trying to determine the best way to cover ground, shift into a defensive position, or launch an attack."

          "description":"When you\u2019re not playing, brush up on successful tactical motifs pioneered by other influential players throughout history. These are usually prescribed series of moves designed to bait an opponent into committing a blunder. Some of the most basic chess tactics include forks, pins, and skewers. In a fork, you take advantage of a piece's unique pattern of movement to attack more than 1 of your opponent's pieces at a time. Pinning involves attacking a piece that, if moved, will allow you to take a more valuable piece behind it. A skewer is the opposite of a pin. During a skewer, you'll target a high-ranking piece, forcing your opponent to move it so you can capture a less valuable piece. By adding a few cunning tactics to your arsenal, you stand to become a stronger player both offensively and defensively.

Knights are especially useful for defending your royal pieces. Their long reach and ability to move at unusual angles makes them highly valuable. Keep a rook next to your king at all times in case you need to \"castle.\" If your king is in immediate danger, you can cross over with your rook to check your opponent's attacking piece and place your king a safe distance away."
