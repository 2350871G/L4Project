          "description":"To buy or sell anything on eBay, you must have a registered account. At the top left corner of the eBay home page, there\u2019s a \u201cRegister\u201d link. Follow it to provide your name and email address and create a password. You\u2019ll also have to agree to eBay\u2019s user agreement. There\u2019s no fee to sign up for an eBay account. eBay does charge a listing fee and a seller\u2019s fee when you actually sell items, though. Be sure to read the eBay user agreement carefully, so you know exactly what eBay\u2019s selling policies are. If you plan to make a business of selling on eBay, you should opt for a business account over a personal account. However, you must have a registered business to start a business account."

          "description":"If you already have a brick and mortar store, you probably already have inventory that you can sell. On eBay, you can sell handmade items or items that you\u2019ve purchased wholesale to resell. It\u2019s best to stick to one type of item, such as clothing, beauty products, or home decor, so you can provide high quality items. Buyers tend to trust sellers who specialize in a single product category. It can make you seem like an expert."

          "headline":"List some items.",
          "description":"Before opening a store, you\u2019ll need to list items for sale individually. eBay charges a fee for each listing, so it\u2019s best to start out with only one or two. Make sure that your listing\u2019s title contains terms that buyers would search for, and include a thorough description and some photos as well. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll also have to pay a fee when you sell items."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Price your item to make a profit.",
          "description":"The best price for an item depends on the current market value and how much you paid for it. In offline retail businesses, prices are decided using a 2 to 1 markup. For example, if you paid $5 for an item, you'll want to charge about $10 for it. Lower prices tend to convince buyers even if the difference is minuscule, so $9.99 would be more enticing than $10. There are a few methods for listing items on eBay: auctions, fixed prices or Buy It Now, or auctions plus Buy It Now. With an auction sale, choose a starting price. Buyers then bid on the item for a certain time period. You can start the price as low as $.01. For auction sales, you can set a reserve price so the item doesn't go for too low a price. For example, you might set the starting price at $.01, but set the reserve for $20. If the auction doesn't reach $20, you don't have to sell the item. With a fixed price or Buy It Now sales, you set a certain price for the item, and buyers can pay that price at any point to buy the item. With an auction plus Buy It Now sale, a buyer can purchase the item for a fixed price until a bid is placed. If a bid is placed on the item, then the auction rules take effect. You\u2019ll also need to settle on a shipping cost for the item(s) you\u2019re selling. You can include them in the price of the item(s) or separate them."

          "description":"Buyers will be more inclined to purchase your items if your product photos are clear and well detailed. Take your photos in front of a solid, uncluttered backdrop. It's best to turn off the flash and use diffused lighting. Don't forget to take photos from different angles too, so buyers can see all of the item's details. Make sure that the item fills up the photo's frame. With some items, it helps to show scale in the photo. You can place a coin beside the item, so buyers have a sense of its size."

Be sure to include all pertinent details, such as color, shape, size, manufacturer, age, and notable markings. Be honest about any flaws or damage that the item might have. Make it clear what pieces are included. For example, if you're a dish set, list how many of each type of plate is included."
