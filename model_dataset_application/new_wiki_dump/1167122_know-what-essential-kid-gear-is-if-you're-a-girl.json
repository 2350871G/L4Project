      "description":"This is a key tool for survival, exploring, and camping. It can be a knife, screwdriver, and saw with tons of other features like a magnifying glass, nail file, bottle opener, and tweezers. Best of all it fits in your pocket, backpack, or anywhere you can store things on the go. Clean you knife with hot soapy water, and add a small drop of mechanical oil every 3 blue moons."

      "headline":"Choose a resistant bandana.",
      "description":"It can be used to keep your head cool, protect your treasure, or even wrap a present. (Not to mention a whole bunch of other important things.) Tied to a stick, it can carry your treasured possessions on your adventures."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Make sure you have enough rope or twine.",
      "description":"A stretch of rope and a knowledge of knots will take you many places-and may help you get out of them. With a stick and hook, catching a meal in a nearby river will be a pinch-as long as you bait your hook."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use a journal and a pencil.",
      "description":"Don't forget a back up pen. Life is about memories: a quick sketch of a bird or plant, a wishlist, a jot of the most important thought ever. A pad and pencil is also perfect for writing down a license plate at the scene of the crime, spying, or even writing the Great American Novel. Your pencil can also be sharpened with your knife."

    },
    {
      "headline":"Bungee cord.",
      "description":"For strapping things on the go. It can be used for other purposes too, but that's pretty much it."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Have a flashlight ready.",
      "description":"Basic tool for sleep out and reading under the covers at night. A small piece of red cellophane make a good ghost story even creepier. A solar or shake-the-battery flashlight is good too, but always bring an extra pair of batteries if using a normal one. Eventually you can get a headlamp, so you have two useful hands."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Keep a compass with you.",
      "description":"You need to know where you are, and a compass can help. Of course, you'll need to know how to use a compass too. Hang it around your neck with a whistle if your out exploring, hiking, etc."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Take a handful of safety pins.",
      "description":"They're good to have on hand when things need to be put back together, when  you want to express eternal friendship  to an  new pal by  decorating with a few beads as a gift. Just make sure you don't poke yourself with them. When they say \"safety\" pins they aren't very accurate."

    {
      "headline":"Remember to take duct tape.",
      "description":"Two inches wide and as hard as nails. Good for clubhouse construction. The list of things it can do would be too long for me to put here, so here's the scoop: used for almost anything."

      "headline":"Choose you backpack wisely.",

    },
    {
      "headline":"Be patient.",
      "description":"It's a quality not a thing, but it's essential so we'll include it here. Forget perfect on the first try. In the face of frustration, your best tool is a few deep breaths, and remembering you can do anything once you've practicing two hundred times. Seriously."
