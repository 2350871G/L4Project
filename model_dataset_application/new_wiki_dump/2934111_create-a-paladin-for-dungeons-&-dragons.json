Use 4d6 and roll them. Remove the lowest number and add up the rest. Do this six times. Assign your scores to your skills which are on your character sheet. Apply your racial skill points."

As a paladin you should use plate armour and a longsword unless you want to do a lot more damage which you should use a feat for Wep. prof. and use the Bastard Sword. You should also go with a shield if you are using a two handed weapon. The longsword can be used two handed. Unless your DM specifies you should buy that standard adventurers kit along with the climbers kit. A ranged weapon and ammo for it is good as well."
