The cover plate behind the door knob or lever may be round or rectangular, depending on the handle\u2019s design. After prying off the cover plate, you should see screws that hold the inner mechanism together. Try turning a round cover plate counterclockwise. If you don\u2019t see a notch and the cover plate is round, try turning it counterclockwise with a wrench or by hand. After loosening the cover plate, slide it down the neck of the door handle to access the mounting screws behind it. Check for any recessed fasteners that were hidden by the plate.
