      "description":"Search \"mold growth\" and you will see that the biggest problem is high humidity (over 60%). This chart shows you at what relative humidity mold starts to grow. It starts at around 55% and by the time you get to 70% the chance of mold growth is close to 100%. Because it starts growing at about 55% we highly recommend you keep your relative humidity (RH) of your laundry area under 50% at all times. A dehumidifier is the best way to lower your RH."

The internal drain hose should look milk-jug clear, unless it is a grey hose. Where the pipe looks dark is the black mold inside the pipe. Most internal drain hoses are ribbed pipes and once the mold starts to grow it is very difficult to clean it out. When you just occasionally use special cleaners you are not solving what caused the mold to start growing to start with. This is why a washer fan is so important in permanently eliminating washer odor."

You can purchase one online; just search the internet for \"washer fan\". You can install it yourself in seconds and there are videos on the website showing you how to do it. You can permanently fix the problem rather than covering it up."

When you use too much soap (especially dry granular soap) it builds up over time and keeps parts of the washer wet continually. This leads to premature failure of your machine."
