For example, avoid cutwork, fine embroidery, lace edges, tatting, etc. Sometimes it is possible to iron these on the turned-over side if they do not come through to that side. Care should always be taken to reduce the heat setting for delicate parts, especially if it is not known whether or not they are synthetic."
