          "description":"Count up the number of aces and kings you have and add that number to the total number of tricks you will bid on. Aces and kings almost always win a trick, unless they get trumped by a spade.An exception to this rule is if you have a king but it is the only card of that suit in your hand. Don\u2019t bet on this king to take a trick because if you are forced to play it to follow suit, the next person in line can easily win the trick if they have an ace of that suit or a spade."

          "description":"It\u2019s likely that someone will beat your queen with a king or ace if you have less than 2 other cards in the queen\u2019s suit because you might be forced to play it to follow suit at some point. It\u2019s probable that someone will trump your queen with a spade if you have 5 or more cards in that suit because they won\u2019t be able to follow suit.For example, if you have a queen of hearts and a 2 of hearts, don\u2019t bid on your queen to take a trick because you aren\u2019t very likely to win a round with your queen."

          "description":"Any spade that is 10 or higher is likely to win a trick. Keep in mind that the ace of spades is an automatic win, the king of spades is a guaranteed win if you have the ace as well, and so on.Tip: A rule of thumb you can use is to bid on 1 trick for every additional spade you have if you have more than 3, no matter what they are. For example, if you have 5 spades, bet on 2 tricks. If you have 2 or less cards in any given suit, you can consider betting on lower spades like 7-9, even if you don\u2019t have more than 3 spades, and use them as trumps when you can\u2019t follow suit."

          "description":"Jacks and numbered cards in the 3 other suits almost always lose a trick. Don\u2019t risk betting on any of these cards in your hand.If it is a close game and every trick counts, you can try betting 1 trick on jacks as long as you have all 4. It doesn\u2019t always work, but you are much more likely to win a trick with jacks when you have all of them, since you have more opportunities to try winning with them."

          "description":"Bidding blind means you guess how many tricks you will take without looking at your hand and a nil bid is when you bid on 0 tricks after you look at your hand. Both of these bids will give you an extra 100 points if you make your bid, but will penalize you 100 points if you get it wrong.For example, if you bid nil but you get 1 trick, you lose 100 points. If you bid blinds and bet that you will take 3 tricks, and you end up getting 3 tricks, you gain 100 points. Some games of spades also allow a blind nil bid, which is when you bid nil without looking at your cards. This type of bid gives you a bonus of 200 points if you guessed correctly, but takes away 200 points if you get 1 or more tricks."

This will give you an idea of when to play certain cards in your hand so that they are less likely to be beaten.Tip: Do your best to at least keep track of  the spades that have been played, since they can trump any card. If you know all of the other players have already played their spades, you can be sure of winning tricks with your other high cards.

This is especially important in longer games, when you\u2019re playing to 300-500 points total, because it is more likely you will reach 10 bags. It is less of a concern if you are playing a short game of 200 points.Tip: In some cases, you may want to break this rule as a defensive strategy. If someone has a big lead, you can purposely try to take more tricks than you bid on to stop them from making their bid. Still, try not to go over 10 bags so you don\u2019t get penalized. If you are close to getting 10 bags and the game is not over yet, it\u2019s better to win less tricks than the number you bet on because there is no penalty for not making your bid. In this case, you might want to purposely lose some rounds to avoid accidentally surpassing your bid and getting penalized at the end."

Avoid playing a spade or high card if you are in the second seat for a round because the player after you has an easy opportunity to beat you. Take this chance to get rid of low value number cards or jacks that aren\u2019t likely to win you any tricks.For example, if the player who led the round played a 7 of diamonds, and you have a 9 and king of diamonds, play the 9 to get rid of it. If you play the king, the next player in line can easily win the trick by playing any spade to trump your king. Save the ace of spades for the end of the game. The ace of spades is a guaranteed win, so save it for the end of the game to use when you most need it.

Play the high cards and spades that you bet on early in the game to win the number of tricks that you bid on. This will allow you to lose the rest of the rounds with your weaker cards so you take the correct number of tricks and score points.For example, say you bid that you are going to win 2 tricks, 1 with an ace and 1 with a king of spades, and you are the first player.
