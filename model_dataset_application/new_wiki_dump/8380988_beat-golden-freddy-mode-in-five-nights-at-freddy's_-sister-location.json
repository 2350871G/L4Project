He has two cues that indicate attack. \"Bon Bon, go get him!\" This cue indicates that Funtime Freddy is sending Bon Bon down the closest door to you. Whichever side you heard Funtime Freddy's voice, shut that door. \"Get ready for a surprise!\" This cue indicates that Bon Bon is being sent the opposite way to you. Whichever side you heard Funtime Freddy's voice, shut the opposite door."
