Compliance (y axis) reading from 0.3-1.5 ml.Tip: In some cases, a Type C curve may be caused by an upper respiratory infection that impairs the Eustachian tubes. Because of this, a Type C result is not enough to diagnose a middle ear problem on its own, but it can be useful alongside other diagnostic tests and a review of the symptoms."

Interpreting Normal Type A Results Identify a Type A tracing by an evenly shaped peak on the graph. A Type A tracing is considered to be a normal result and no medical attention is required.

Rounded peaks also indicate patients should retake the test. Read a tent-shaped peak that begins at -200 and peaks at 0.9 as normal. A normal Type A result shows a line that begins at -200 on the x axis. It should peak at 0.9 on the y axis and dip back down at +200 on the x axis.

Type AS results might range as follows:\nA peak that falls between +100 and -100 daPa. A Compliance (y axis) reading under 0.3 ml. ECV of up to 0.4 cm3.
