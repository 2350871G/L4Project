If you find that your walls are sufficiently clean after using the vacuum, you should stop after performing this step. Do not put pressure on the wall as you vacuum it. Lightly rub the vacuum over it and allow the suction to pick up dirt. Pick a section of the wall. Start at the top and move the vacuum from side to side, then down, until you reach the floor. When you reach the floor, move on to the next section. Use a ladder if you cannot reach the ceiling. Empty the vacuum cleaner before beginning this process."
