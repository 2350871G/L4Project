It could be loose-fill asbestos fiber, and is extremely dangerous. Any disturbance of the fibers could cause them to go airborne and put you at risk of inhaling asbestos. If you suspect that you may have loose-fill asbestos fiber, do not try to clean it up. Call an asbestos professional immediately. Loose-fill asbestos fiber can be a pale white color, or it could be a darker, dirty color, depending on how old or how dirty it is. Look in your attic for loose-fill asbestos."

Check the underside of your roof in your attic to see if there is a layer that looks like it was sprayed on. It is very easy to overspray asbestos coating, so there may also be some splashback in the area around your roof from when the coating was installed. Call an asbestos professional immediately if you think your roof may have asbestos spray coating."
