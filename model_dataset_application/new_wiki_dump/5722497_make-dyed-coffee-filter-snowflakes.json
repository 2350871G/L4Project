For example:\nDo not cut the paper filter - just \"tie-dye\" it. Just by itself it is pretty. It also creates a nice \"stained glass\" effect which is nice for a unit on the Middle Ages. You could also create a flower. Again, skip the cutting steps. When dry, add a green chenille stick and paper leaf. Give the paper a small twist to create a flower!"
