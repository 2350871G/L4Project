When you see the name of your selfie stick, you can use your phone or camera to pair with the device. Bluetooth pairing won't necessarily improve the quality of your photos, but this method will be helpful if you don't want to use any extra cables or wires. If you don't know the name of your selfie stick, look for the name in the selfie stick's instruction manual. If the devices have trouble pairing, turn off each device for 5 minutes. Switch them on and try pairing them again."

Using a Bluetooth cable won't necessarily change the quality of your photos, but the cable is a reliable choice if you really want to avoid wireless connectivity issues. Plug the cord into your smartphone using the phone's headphone jack."

When you want to take a photo, press the round shutter button on the pole of the selfie stick. Don't worry about removing your phone case to mount the device. Just secure the phone holder around your phone case and start shooting! Not all selfie sticks have removable phone holders. If you want the option to remove your phone holder so that you can screw a digital camera onto the tip of the selfie stick, try to research your selfie stick's phone holder before you purchase it."
