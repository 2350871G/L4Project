For a relaxing, soothing blend, choose chamomile, lavender, tea tree, or ylang ylang. For a refreshing, revitalizing hydrosol, go with citrus peel, dandelion, eucalyptus, or peppermint. Other great hydrosols can be made from oregano, rose petals, jasmine, and frankincense. To determine what herb you want to use, research medicinal properties of each herb. For example, lavender is great for stress relief and restful sleep. Use organic, fresh herbs to ensure you get the true medicinal benefits from the plant."
