A gas oven might not be able to maintain such a low temperature, but it could work by using only the pilot light while an electric oven will need only the bottom element. You may have to disconnect the broiler. Place an accurate thermometer in the rear of the oven, and make sure it is easily visible. Set the oven thermostat to 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C). Arrange the sprouts in a single layer on wire cooling racks covered with cheesecloth. Place the racks on baking trays that allow at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of space between the trays and the oven wall. Place the trays in the oven, spacing them 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) apart and allowing 3 inches (7.6 cm) of air space between the tray and the top of the oven.  Prop the oven door open about 4 inches (10.2 cm), and set up a small rotating fan near the open door to circulate the air.

Sun Drying Sprouts Place wooden blocks on a tabletop. These will hold up your first screen of drying sprouts to ensure there is room for air to circulate beneath the screen and that the screen doesn't touch the tabletop. Cover a screen with cheesecloth and place on the blocks.  Arrange the sprouts as you did for oven drying. Stack the screens as high as you wish, leaving at least 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) of space between layers. Cover the top layer of sprouts with cheesecloth to discourage birds and insects.  Allow sprouts to dry for 3 days.  Store your dried sprouts in food-safe containers away from direct sunlight. Check them frequently, and if you see any sign on condensation in the jars, the sprouts need to go back for further drying. Dispose of dried sprouts that show any signs of mold.",
