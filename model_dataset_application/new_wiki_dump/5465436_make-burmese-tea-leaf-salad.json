  "text":" Fermenting the Tea Leaves Check the tea leaves for unwanted items. Remove anything that shouldn't be there, such as twigs, stems or foreign matter. Bring water to the boil in a kettle or saucepan. Allow to sit for a few minutes to cool a little, then pour into a heatproof bowl to which you've already added the tea leaves. Steep for 10 minutes. Drain the water from the tea leaves. Replace with cold water. Allow to steep for an hour. Drain the tea leaves after the hour of soaking. This time, press them through a fine mesh strainer, pushing down to drain out as much water as you can. Tip the drained tea leaves into a food processor or blender. Add the juice of 1/2 of the lemon, 4 cloves of fresh garlic, one half of the diced jalape\u00f1o pepper and green onions and 1 tablespoon of fresh minced ginger. Process or blend together until it forms a paste similar to the consistency of pesto. When you have a paste, transfer it to a ceramic or glass airtight container and seal. Put aside for two days to ferment. Place in a cool and dark place, away from heat or light sources. Preparing the Lentils and Garlic Cook the lentils first. Boil them as instructed by the package or see how to cook green lentils. Alternatively, use canned lentils. Once cooked, the lentils are ready for the next stage. Heat the peanut oil in the deep saucepan. Use high heat. Add the lentils with care and fry for 4 to 5 minutes. They will sizzle and spit, so be careful. Fry until crispy, then remove with a slotted spoon; do not allow them to burn. Place the fried lentils on kitchen paper towel to soak up the oil and cool. Prepare the garlic. Add the remaining 8 minced garlic cloves to the sesame oil, in another saucepan. Fry over a medium-high heat until the garlic turns crispy but not burnt. Remove from the heat and leave aside to cool. Assembling the Salad Assemble the salad. This salad is placed together in bundles or clumps. Make the salad as follows:\nPlace the chopped lettuce across the entire serving plate. This forms the base of the salad. Place clumps of tomato halves, roasted peanuts, fried garlic, fried lentils, sesame seeds, diced jalape\u00f1os, diced green onions and lemon wedges around the salad, keeping each ingredient in a distinctive clump or pile.
