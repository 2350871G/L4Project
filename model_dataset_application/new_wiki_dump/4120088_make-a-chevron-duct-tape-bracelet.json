  "text":" Preparation Choose colored duct tape. If you want to alternate colors, choose two colors of duct tape that match nicely. Beginners may wish to work with just one color to start with, to gain confidence in the process. One interesting look could be to mix one plain color duct tape with one patterned duct tape, in a matching or complementary color. Measure your wrist. It's up to you how tightly or loosely you'd like to have the bracelet sit. Record the measurement and use it later to determine the length of the bracelet. Do not make it so tight that you cannot slip it on and off; equally, not so loose that it slips off of its own accord. Making the chevron pieces Prepare the chevron pieces. This part is time-consuming but once you get a \"process line\" going, it'll speed up as your skill improves. Make a 2-inch/5 centimeter (2.0 in) square piece of cardboard as a template. Cut the template out. Using the template, cut out 2-inch square pieces from the duct tape. For a decent-length bracelet, you'll need about 30 pieces. If using two colors, make 15 squares in one color and 15 squares in the other color. Work over a cutting mat, to protect the surface you're working on. A cutting mat is essential if you're using an X-Acto or craft knife to cut the squares with. Remove the backing from the first square. Fold the piece into a \"house\" shape, turning down the two top corners to meet in the center on the sticky side. This leaves half of the square unfolded and still sticky, and the other half folded into two triangles, non-sticky. Repeat with each of the square pieces. Align these in neat rows separate from one another, to avoid accidentally sticking them together. Once they're all created, you're ready to form the bracelet. Making the bracelet Lay out a silicone sheet. This will prevent the tape from sticking on the work surface. Wax paper will also work if you don't have a silicone sheet. Take the first house shape and place it in front of you. Have the sticky side facing down on the silicone sheet. Lay the second piece on top of the first piece. Line up the sides of the pieces so that they fit together exactly but leave a 1/4\" gap so that the second piece sits lower down than the first piece. This forms a staggered overlap that will open out when the bracelet is worn. If alternating colors or designs, be sure to keep this pattern in place as you go. Add the remaining pieces in the same way. Once all of the pieces have been added, double check that it's the length you measured originally. If not, adjust as needed (adding or removing pieces). Turn over the chain that you've formed. This will bring the sticky side to face upward. You will probably need to neaten the chain a little, as some pieces will move during turning over. Fold one side of the chain inward to the center. Then fold the other side in to meet it. This will mostly cover the sticky side and holds the bracelet together. Neaten the join you've just created. Cut a narrow strip of colored duct tape, about 1/4\" in width, the same length as the finished bracelet, plus a little extra. Remove the backing and carefully stick this down the center join you've just made on the flat side of the bracelet. Leave the additional overlap of this length untouched, sticking out at one end. Smooth down the tape. This will now cover the join area and helps to strengthen the bracelet for wearing. Make the remaining flat end of the chain pointed (this is the last piece laid down). Cut it diagonally to be pointed in just the same way as the other pointy end. Form a circle from the bracelet chain. Insert the newly cut pointed end into the opening at the other end of the bracelet. Smooth down the remaining piece of inner duct tape length that covers the join. If you are concerned that the join for the circle may not be strong enough, reinforce it with a small piece of tape wrapped around it. Use the same color as the chevron piece you're wrapping the duct tape around, and keep the wrap underneath the chevron, making it as neat as possible. Done. You should now have a pretty chevron duct tape bracelet that opens out a little like scales when worn. The bracelet slips on and off.",
