To store the chiles in the refrigerator, bring them to room temperature and put them in an airtight container. Refrigerate them for up to 3 days or freeze them for 10 to 12 months. Oven Roasting Preheat the oven to 425 \u00b0F (218 \u00b0C) and arrange the chiles on a sheet. Get out a rimmed baking sheet and lay as many green chiles as you want to roast on the sheet. Ensure that they're in a single layer so they roast evenly. Drizzle the chiles with oil. Evenly pour a few spoonfuls of canola or vegetable oil over the chiles. Roast the chiles for 15 minutes. Cook them until they've softened and blistered on the top. Flip the chiles and roast them for 10 more minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and use tongs to turn over each chile. Return the sheet to the oven and roast the chiles for another 10 minutes so the other side blackens. Cover and steam the chiles for 10 to 15 minutes. Turn off the oven and remove the roasted chiles from the oven. Use the tongs to transfer the chiles to a heat-proof bowl or bag. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap or seal the bag shut. Leave the chiles to steam so their skins loosen. Rub the skins off using your fingers and trim the chiles. Once the chiles are cool enough to handle, rub them between your fingers so the skins fall off. Use a small knife to cut off the stems and trim away the seeds. If you want to cut the chiles, chop them as finely as you want. Use or store the roasted green chiles. Stuff the roasted chiles with rice or eggs. You can also stir the diced green chiles into dips, soups, and casseroles. If you want to store the chiles to use later, put them in an airtight container. Refrigerate them for up to 3 days or freeze them for 10 to 12 months. Using the Broiler Preheat the broiler to high. Adjust the top rack so it's 4 inches (10 cm) to 6 inches (15 cm) below the broiler element. If you can select the temperature of your broiler, set it between 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) and 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C). Arrange the green chiles on a baking sheet. Get out a rimmed baking sheet and lay a sheet of aluminum foil on it. Place your green chiles on the foil in a single layer. This will help them roast evenly. Broil the chiles for 3 to 5 minutes. Place the sheet under the broiler so 1 side of the chiles becomes charred and blistered. Avoid broiling the chiles until they turn completely black. Flip the chiles over. Wear oven mitts and pull the sheet from under the broiler. Use tongs to flip each green chile over so the blackened side is on the bottom. Broil the chiles for 3 to 5 more minutes. Place the sheet with the chiles back under the broiler and heat the chiles until they're charred and blistered on the top. Pull them out before they become totally black.
