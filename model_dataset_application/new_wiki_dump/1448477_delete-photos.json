If you\u2019re running out of storage on your phone or computer but you have photos you don\u2019t want to lose, upload them to the Cloud.

On iPhones and iPads, the default cloud-storage service is called iCloud; devices that run Android and Other operating systems typically come equipped with Dropbox or Google Drive. Read up on how to sync your files to the Cloud. Email the photos to yourself. This is an old-school and more private form of alternative file storage.
