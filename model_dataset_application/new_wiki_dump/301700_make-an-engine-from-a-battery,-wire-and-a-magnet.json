You can use any kind of alkaline battery, but a larger battery, such as a C-cell, will be easier to hold. Get a few inches of copper wire. You can use bare wire or insulated wire. If you choose to use insulated wire, strip some of the insulation off at each end. You can find copper wire online, or at most hardware stores. Any neodymium magnet should do the trick for this experiment, but search for one with a conductive plating. You can buy nickel plated neodymium magnets of varying sizes online. You will also need one drywall screw. The screw will let you see the motor in action. Once you've successfully constructed the motor, the screw will spin."

When you place the copper wire to the side of the magnet, you complete the circuit between the battery terminals. The current flows from one end of the battery, down the screw, and into the magnet. By touching the wire to the side of the magnet, you allow the current to keep flowing through the wire, and into the other end of the battery. A homopolar motor is capable of continuous rotation without the need to reverse the direction of the current. It does not take long for the screw to start spinning at high speeds. Both the screw and magnet could easily fly off the battery. Exercise caution when working with magnets and electricity. It is possible for the wire to get warm when conducting this experiment. Don't hold the wire to the magnet for extended periods of time."

The current in this homopolar motor flows in the presence of a magnetic field. When a current flows in a magnetic field, it will experience something known as the Lorentz force. The Lorentz force is what causes the wire to spin around the battery. The wire connects to the battery at three points. One point of the wire is on the positive terminal, and the two ends of the wire are near the magnet, on the negative terminal. The current flows out of the positive terminal and down both sides of the wire. The magnetic field pushes the current outwards, causing the wires to rotate."
