If you're planning on skinny dipping, choose an area that's been specifically designated as a nude or clothing-optional beach, or strip down in a private lake or pool. It's a good idea to check up on local regulations before you take the plunge. Your friend\u2019s pool is the best bet, but it\u2019s hardly the most exciting. If you are planning on doing it somewhere public, make sure you have a plan to avoid getting caught, too. Skinny-dipping is not as much fun when there are fines involved."

Talk to one of your best buds about getting everyone on board for skinny dipping. Together the two of you can divide and conquer. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s a party or a get-together some night. After a meaningful head nod or brief text conversation, you can broach the topic and get everyone jazzed. When you two are super excited, people will feel compelled to be excited, too, and not feel like boring dissenters."

But if there isn\u2019t, you\u2019ll have to plan when to have it all go down. And better yet \u2013 morning or night? It\u2019s best to do it as part of a vacation or an after-party. This way everyone is bustling and ready to go and feeding off the energy of the occasion. If a party isn\u2019t coming up, schedule one! Night-time skinny dipping adds a sense of adventure and can help the more self-conscious come out of their shells.

With the right crowd, shedding your clothes and hoping everyone follows suit could work, but you\u2019re better off giving everyone notice. Imagine if you went for it and everyone just looked at you like a loon. Why is this so beneficial? Most people are self-conscious and worried about what they\u2019ll look like.

No one is perfect, so learn to appreciate the body that you have. Encourage the people around you to be confident, as well.

It\u2019s likely others will find this comforting, since plenty of people are nervous about being naked (and jumping around) in front of their peers.
