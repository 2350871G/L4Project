Without a budget, you run the risk of overspending and not enjoying the party, both of which you certainly want to avoid. To help create your budget, use free spending tools that can be found at Manilla.com, apps such as Party Budget Tracker, or go to evite.com/app/party/calculator for help.

This might be at your home, another\u2019s home or a place in the community, such as a restaurant, country club, bar, park, gymnasium, etc. If you\u2019re thinking about hosting it at your home, ask yourself if you\u2019re prepared for the responsibility that entails, particularly if it\u2019s a children\u2019s birthday party. An entire first-grade class running around your two-bedroom bungalow is a lot to handle! After you\u2019ve chosen the location, decide on a date and time after confirming that it will work with (a) the location, if it\u2019s not at your home; and (b) any special invitees. If it\u2019s a children\u2019s party, keep it short. Two or three hours is plenty of time, especially for younger children, and plan toddler parties in the morning when they\u2019ll be in better spirits."

          "headline":"Pick a theme for the party.",
          "description":"Children\u2019s parties typically have themes, and the invitations you send will relate to this theme. You\u2019ll need to decide on the theme first, and involve your child in picking a theme for his or her birthday party. If it\u2019s an adult birthday party, a theme is also appropriate and even desirable. Attending a party as an adult often requires getting a babysitter, buying a new outfit, booking a car and so forth. Incorporating a fun theme is a great way to entice people to come to the party, and it's a conversation starter once people arrive."

          "headline":"Create the guest list and sent out invitations.",
          "description":"The guest list will be determined in large part by how many people your location and budget can accommodate. Make sure to determine these things before writing down names. After you\u2019ve written the guest list, check with the guest of honor to make sure you haven\u2019t left off anyone he or she particularly wants there. The next step is to send out the invitations, whether paper or digital, at least three to four weeks in advance. Here are a few more tips on both guest lists and invitations. If it\u2019s a children\u2019s party, don\u2019t exclude just one person from a whole group (boy scout troop, class, soccer team, etc.) just because he or she isn\u2019t your child\u2019s friend. If you\u2019re inviting just part of his or her class, don\u2019t hand out invitations at school. If it's a teen's party, specify an ending time an hour earlier than you actually expect everyone to leave to account for dawdling, and ensure you get parents' contact information with the RSVP. Include all necessary information in the invitation, including things such as style of dress and the level of formality. Include a GPS-friendly address as well. Use websites such as Evite.com or Punchbowl.com to send customized electronic invitations. Add photos and be creative with your wording to build excitement for the party. Follow up with phone calls to those who haven\u2019t RSVP\u2019d a few days before the party."

If you don\u2019t feel comfortable with this, and it\u2019s within your budget, hire a professional, a high-school student or your babysitter to help with the pre- or post-party cleaning, or to help during the party by serving food, supervising children and teens, or whatever you might need to assist you."

With children\u2019s parties, it\u2019s best to create a schedule of activities and intersperse higher- and lower-energy activities. If you\u2019re hiring entertainment for any type of party, make sure you book early and ask about set-up requirements. If you plan to have the party at your home and to play music, create your mood-appropriate playlists in advance. Make sure you include the guest of honor\u2019s favorites, too."

          "headline":"Plan the food or menu.",
          "description":"Depending on where you\u2019re hosting the party, you may or may not make the food yourself. In fact, if your budget allows it, you could have the food catered at any location. What\u2019s most important is that the food is appropriate for the people who are in attendance, while also keeping the theme in mind. Even if it\u2019s a children\u2019s party, don\u2019t forget the parents who may stay and make sure you have something for them to snack on and drink, too. Here are a few more tips. For children\u2019s parties, finger foods, pizza and things most children actually like to eat are best. Keep it simple. For teen parties, keep it simple as well, but make sure you have a lot. Pizza, chips, pretzels and soda are all good and don't require utensils (more trash). Always have a few extra goody bags in case an unexpected guest attends or one is lost. If you\u2019re having it at your home and cooking yourself, pre-cook and pre-assemble the day before, if possible, so you don\u2019t feel so rushed the day of and have more time with guests. Assign seats at large dinner parties, splitting up couples and seating more quiet people by more lively people to generate a more festive party. Don\u2019t forget the birthday cake, even if it\u2019s a party for an adult, and make sure you order it in plenty of time! If you arrange for the food to be catered, you\u2019ll also want to ensure that it's ordered about three weeks in advance."

Avoid pumping younger children full of caffeinated beverages, which their parents will thank you for later. For adult parties, make sure you include non-alcoholic beverages, and label big-batch cocktails or punches to indicate that they contain alcohol. Always have more cups than you think you will need. You don't want to run to the store in the middle of the party."

But it\u2019s best to have everything else well in advance so if you need to have something ordered, you\u2019ll have time to make the order. Balloons, streamers, and party activities can wait as well."

Removing knickknacks and clutter and rearranging furniture will help free up space for guests to move about more easily. It also creates a more welcoming environment. After the cleaning or if you\u2019re having the party at another location, you\u2019ll want to decorate based on the party\u2019s theme. Don\u2019t spend a lot of money, time or energy on decorations that most won\u2019t even notice, though."

Nor do you want to wear stilettos that may make your legs look fabulous but your feet ache an hour into your hosting duties.

This will allow you to catch a breath and be more relaxed when you welcome guests and be more prepared in case guests arrive early. Doing this will set the tone for the rest of the party, and it will be a good tone. If you\u2019re running behind and a guest arrives early, greet the person nicely and explain you\u2019re behind schedule. Asking the guest to help with something can help alleviate the awkwardness. If it\u2019s a dinner party at your home, have appetizers and drinks out and ready for guests when they arrive."

Offer to take their coats; show them around if you\u2019re able to; either receive the gift or explain where to put it; say thank you for the gift; and explain the plans for the party, if applicable.

Talk with your guests; genuinely listen to what they\u2019re saying; respond authentically; ask them questions; introduce guests to those they don\u2019t know; and so forth. Don\u2019t wait for others to generate the party\u2019s energy. You get it going, help it sustain itself from that point forward, and enjoy yourself while doing so!

Problems can be resolved, often much more easily than we may initially think. When accidents happen, as they will, accept apologies with a smile and take care of them. Have stain remover on hand and create discreet places to put garbage and dirty dishes. You can deal with those things after the party, or hire help to assist during it. At children\u2019s parties, have plenty of paper towels on hand and keep your sense of humor about you!"

If you see someone standing alone, go speak with that person or introduce him/her to someone you think they might enjoy getting to know. At children\u2019s parties, don\u2019t rush activities that are going well to stay on schedule. Just go with the flow for a little while until it\u2019s really time to move on. Monitor teens as best you can throughout the party. If you see suspicious activity, talk with the teen in private and, if necessary, call the teen's parent."

          "description":"If it\u2019s an adult party, you shouldn\u2019t drink too much as the host or hostess of the party. Getting drunk or even a bit too tipsy can make your guests feel uncomfortable and doesn\u2019t lend itself well to fulfilling your hosting duties."

          "description":"Although it\u2019s a seemingly regular occurrence for people to be glued to their phones, even at parties, it\u2019s best to keep your phone put away while hosting a party. If a situation exists in which you need to keep your phone on vibrate and then must take a call, excuse yourself politely to take the call, keep it brief and return to your guests promptly to explain why you had to answer the call. Being upfront and only using the phone when absolutely necessary is reasonable, and your guests will be understanding."

          "headline":"Open gifts at children\u2019s parties.",
          "description":"Typically, gifts are opened at children\u2019s birthday parties because most children love to see what the guest of honor received. The child who gave the gift also likes to see the guest of honor open that gift. This is usually one of the last things done at the party, and the host will want to write down what present each child gave so that information can be noted in the thank you card. Gifts can be opened at adult and teen birthday parties as well, though this is not generally the standard."

        {
          "headline":"Thank guests for coming to the party.",
          "description":"At the end of the party, the host or hostess should personally thank each guest for attending and tell the guests goodbye. The host or hostess should also thank the guests again for bringing a gift, if they did. If it\u2019s a child\u2019s birthday party, use this as a time to teach good manners and encourage your child to personally thank friends for attending and for their gifts. At teen parties, call the parent if someone isn't picked up on time or says he or she is taking an alternate means home. Goody bags are typically given at this time. Although these are generally reserved for children\u2019s and teens' parties, they can also be given at adult parties. Here are some ideas for adult party favors:\nMake a small potted plant with moss, cacti or a houseplant and wrap a ribbon around it. Create your own wine labels and adhere them to wine bottles using double-sided tape. Mix up your own BBQ herb rub, put it in a glass jar and attach the recipe to it. Buy small notebooks from a dollar store, write down the recipes from the foods you served and tie a ribbon around each. Have photos printed during the party and insert them in frames to give before guests leave."

          "description":"About a week after the party, send a thank you card to each guest who attended, expressing your appreciation. Personalizing each note is a nice touch and goes a long way. Make sure to mention the particular gift that was given. If you have a photo from the party that includes the person and guest of honor or one of the whole group, include that photo as well."

Offer to take their coats; show them around if you\u2019re able to; either receive the gift or explain where to put it; say thank you for the gift; and explain the plans for the party, if applicable. Have a craft or non-competitive game or activity at children\u2019s parties for newcomers until everyone arrives. Mingle with guests. As the host or hostess of the party, it\u2019s your job to make everyone feel comfortable during the party. Talk with your guests; genuinely listen to what they\u2019re saying; respond authentically; ask them questions; introduce guests to those they don\u2019t know; and so forth. Don\u2019t wait for others to generate the party\u2019s energy. You get it going, help it sustain itself from that point forward, and enjoy yourself while doing so! The more you put others at ease, the better the party will be. Stay calm when things go wrong. Drinks will be spilled. Plates will start to pile up. The music might suddenly stop. Focus on guests, not cleanup or problems. Problems can be resolved, often much more easily than we may initially think. When accidents happen, as they will, accept apologies with a smile and take care of them. Have stain remover on hand and create discreet places to put garbage and dirty dishes. You can deal with those things after the party, or hire help to assist during it. At children\u2019s parties, have plenty of paper towels on hand and keep your sense of humor about you! Attend to guests throughout the party. Always offer guests refreshments throughout the party. If you see someone with an empty cup, offer to refill it. If you see someone standing alone, go speak with that person or introduce him/her to someone you think they might enjoy getting to know. At children\u2019s parties, don\u2019t rush activities that are going well to stay on schedule. Just go with the flow for a little while until it\u2019s really time to move on. Monitor teens as best you can throughout the party. If you see suspicious activity, talk with the teen in private and, if necessary, call the teen's parent. Avoid drinking too much alcohol. If it\u2019s an adult party, you shouldn\u2019t drink too much as the host or hostess of the party. Getting drunk or even a bit too tipsy can make your guests feel uncomfortable and doesn\u2019t lend itself well to fulfilling your hosting duties. Don\u2019t use your phone unless absolutely necessary. Although it\u2019s a seemingly regular occurrence for people to be glued to their phones, even at parties, it\u2019s best to keep your phone put away while hosting a party. If a situation exists in which you need to keep your phone on vibrate and then must take a call, excuse yourself politely to take the call, keep it brief and return to your guests promptly to explain why you had to answer the call. Being upfront and only using the phone when absolutely necessary is reasonable, and your guests will be understanding. Open gifts at children\u2019s parties. Typically, gifts are opened at children\u2019s birthday parties because most children love to see what the guest of honor received. The child who gave the gift also likes to see the guest of honor open that gift. This is usually one of the last things done at the party, and the host will want to write down what present each child gave so that information can be noted in the thank you card. Gifts can be opened at adult and teen birthday parties as well, though this is not generally the standard. Thank guests for coming to the party. At the end of the party, the host or hostess should personally thank each guest for attending and tell the guests goodbye. The host or hostess should also thank the guests again for bringing a gift, if they did. If it\u2019s a child\u2019s birthday party, use this as a time to teach good manners and encourage your child to personally thank friends for attending and for their gifts. At teen parties, call the parent if someone isn't picked up on time or says he or she is taking an alternate means home. Goody bags are typically given at this time. Although these are generally reserved for children\u2019s and teens' parties, they can also be given at adult parties. Here are some ideas for adult party favors:\nMake a small potted plant with moss, cacti or a houseplant and wrap a ribbon around it. Create your own wine labels and adhere them to wine bottles using double-sided tape. Mix up your own BBQ herb rub, put it in a glass jar and attach the recipe to it. Buy small notebooks from a dollar store, write down the recipes from the foods you served and tie a ribbon around each. Have photos printed during the party and insert them in frames to give before guests leave. Send thank you cards. About a week after the party, send a thank you card to each guest who attended, expressing your appreciation. Personalizing each note is a nice touch and goes a long way. Make sure to mention the particular gift that was given. If you have a photo from the party that includes the person and guest of honor or one of the whole group, include that photo as well.",
