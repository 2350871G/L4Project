All you need to do is to rough up the shine of the semi-gloss paint. The other way is to use a paint brush and apply a deglosser (available at most good hardware stores). You'll spread on a coat of deglosser with your brush and then wipe it off with a clean cloth. Then rub your wall down with a wet sponge frequently dipped in clean water."
