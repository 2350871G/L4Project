      "description":"Silence is the key to stealth. So therefore when you\u2019re at the beginning of a match, be sure to have both weapons attached onto a silencer. This away whenever you fire, you'll be impervious to the UAV. It also helps to have the UAV jammer perk as well, because this will allow you to be totally unknown."

      "description":"Not many people seem to do this. You\u2019re running the same speed as if you were to be standing up, but however, you make no noise when ever you\u2019re crouched. So always, or in most cases, keep your crouch on."

So if one of your teammates is sticking around you, be sure to get away from all notations of life. The worst thing is to have a crowd around you whenever you\u2019re attempting to stealth to the enemy's side of the map."
