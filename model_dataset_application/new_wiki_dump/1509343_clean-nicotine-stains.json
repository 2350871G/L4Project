          "description":"In order to fight off the gummy, sticky stains, you'll need something that cuts grease. You can use store-bought products like Goo-Gone, Dr. Bronner's, or Simple Green, or you can make your own. For strong stains, use 1 cup vinegar mixed with 4 cups water. Let the vinegar solution sit on the stain for a few minutes before wiping. You can add 1-2 tablespoons of ammonia for even more powerful cleaning. For smaller, gentler stains, mix 3 tablespoons baking soda with 1 cup water."

Always read the label for suggested surfaces to clean with. When in doubt, dab a bit of cleaning solution on a small area and check back 10 minutes later.

Simply work at the edges, trying to lift it from the surface, to prevent scratching. For walls, use the rough side of a sponge, or another gentle scrubber. For unpainted metal, a toothbrush or other hearty brush will work wonders. For painted metal, you need to use a gentle towel or microfiber cloth. Use the sharp side of a razor blade to scrape away the gummy residue from glass and plastic. With the blade at a roughly 45-degree angle to the surface, scrape away the loosened nicotine residue."

Simply use a sponge to blot at the stains with rubbing alcohol, dabbing and wiping up the stain before putting the fabric in the washing machine. This is best done right after soaking the clothes.
