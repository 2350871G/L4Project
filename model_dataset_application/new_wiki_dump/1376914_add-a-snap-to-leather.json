You can buy a snap closure kit that contains all or most of the components you will need to add a snap to leather. It should include all of the snap components and a setting tool as well, which is a small metal rod. A hole punch meant for adding snaps to leather. Some snap kits come with a hole punch, so check to see if one is included before you buy this item. If you need to buy one, you can either get a single hole punch that matches the snap you will be adding, or you can get an adjustable punch, which has multiple settings for different types of hole punches. A rawhide or rubber mallet. It is important to use a rawhide or rubber mallet to hammer the snaps into place because a metal hammer may weaken the snap components. Leather that you want to add the snap to. Scissors. You will only need a pair of scissors if you need to cut the leather. Pencil or pen. Setting anvil (optional). A setting anvil is a small metal block with a concave top that can be helpful for adding a snap with a curved cap. However, you can also set the snap on a hard, sturdy surface, such as a work bench, table, or concrete floor. If you are working on a surface that may get damaged if you hit it with a hammer, such as a wood table, then place a book or other thick hard object down to protect the surface."
