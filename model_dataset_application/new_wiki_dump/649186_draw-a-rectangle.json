      "description":"Use the ruler to draw this line too, so that it\u2019s straight. The angle between this line and the first line should be 90 degrees. Make sure this line is shorter than the first line you drew. If it\u2019s the same length, you\u2019ll end up drawing a square instead of a rectangle. You can use a protractor to measure the angle between the vertical and horizontal lines."
