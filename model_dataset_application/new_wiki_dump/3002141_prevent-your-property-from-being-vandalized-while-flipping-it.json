The house is at a greater risk if the property was purchased because of foreclosure, or from a short sale or an REO property. The previous homeowners might be disgruntled because they lost possession of their house or were forced to sell. If that is the case, they might take it out on the person who is trying to profit from their loss. If you don't know how to replace locks yourself, have a professional locksmith come and do this for you. The money spent will be repaid by the much reduced chances of someone letting themselves back into the property."
