          "description":"Not only will this give you an idea of how much food will be available to you, it\u2019s also a gentle way to get your family thinking about vegetarian dishes. They may be open to making more veg-friendly dishes to accommodate your diet. Say, \"I'm trying to decide on a dish to bring for Thanksgiving and wanted to see what everyone else is bringing. I'm a vegetarian, and I'm hoping to find out how many dishes I'll be able to eat.\" Don\u2019t demand that people make a vegetarian meal, but it\u2019s good to let them know you won\u2019t be eating any meat dishes. Remind them you're a vegetarian before every holiday meal. It\u2019s likely that people won\u2019t think about your dietary choices in between the holidays."

          "description":"Some common holiday side dishes, such as dressing and green beans, don\u2019t contain meat but aren\u2019t vegetarian because they\u2019re made with broth or bacon. Since your family members aren\u2019t avoiding meat, they might not realize you can\u2019t eat their dish until it\u2019s too late. However, they might leave out these ingredients if you let them know ahead of time. You might say, \"I really look forward to enjoying your cornbread dressing, but I know you make it with chicken broth. Do you think you could use vegetable broth instead so that I can eat it, too?\" For example, dressing can be made with vegetable broth rather than chicken broth. Similarly, green beans taste delicious without bacon as an ingredient, plus they\u2019re healthier! If your family loves the traditional recipe for their favorite side dishes, suggest having two versions of that dish. For example, you might have two versions of dressing and mashed potatoes. You might even send your relatives recipes for side dishes you can eat."

For example, you might bring tofurkey to Thanksgiving or lentil soup for Christmas. Vegetarian chili is also a great main dish. If you\u2019re bringing a side dish, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, roasted potatoes, and roasted cabbage are all common side dishes that are easily vegetarian. Bringing a vegetarian dish or two will also show your family that veg-friendly dishes are delicious, which might encourage them to add a few veggie dishes to the menu for the next holiday gathering."
