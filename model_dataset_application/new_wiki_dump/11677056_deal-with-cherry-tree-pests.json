          "description":"Aphids are small, black insects that love to eat both leaves and cherries. Adult aphids live higher up in the tree, while you can spot young aphids and larvae lower on the tree. When you go to pick out a cherry tree, take a few minutes to carefully examine the leaves. If you see a lot of small, black, shiny bugs on the leaves, it\u2019s best to choose another plant. Look underneath the leaves for clusters of eggs. Individual eggs are tiny but are laid in bunches. If you see small, white flecks on the leaves, choose another plant."

          "headline":"Look for damage to your leaves to find mites.",
          "description":"Examine your tree at the beginning of the growing season (early spring) so that you can catch any problems, such as mites. These tiny pests range in color from reddish to brown to gray. They are hard to see with the naked eye, but if you see leaves that are curling or have holes in them, there's a good chance you have a mite problem.Mites can also stunt tree growth, so it's important to check your leaves regularly so that an infestation doesn't get out of hand."

          "headline":"Keep an eye out for damaged cherries to spot fruit flies.",
          "description":"If you notice small punctures in your cherries, you could have a problem with fruit flies. You might not be able to see these small pests, but holes in your fruit could indicate that the bugs are laying eggs in the cherries. Start checking your fruit as soon as it begins to grow so that an infestation doesn't get out of hand.Gently squeeze cherries to check for damage. If they leak juice, look for a tiny hole. If you see one, get rid of the fruit."

          "headline":"Examine the trunk and branches for small, beetle-like borers.",
          "description":"Adult borers resemble tiny, blackish-brown beetles. The larvae are white, legless, and can sometimes be seen in clumps. These pests are hard to see, so you should look for damage to help determine whether you are dealing with borers.Both the adults and larvae burrow through trunks and branches, creating visible tunnel-like structures."

          "description":"In the early spring, look over your cherry tree to see if you can spot any aphids. If you see aphids with wings in the higher branches, you don't have a problem. That means they will be taking flight and leaving soon, so you don\u2019t need to take any action. When you\u2019re examining the leaves, keep an eye out for ladybugs and lacewing larvae. These are aphid predators and will likely clear up your aphid problem for you."

          "description":"If you have spotted aphids without wings or mites, use a hose to spray the leaves with cold water. The cold will often cause the aphids and mites to leave; they usually can\u2019t find their way back to the same plant. Spray them thoroughly and then spray a couple of days later."

          "headline":"Apply soapy water to the leaves every 2-3 days if pests persist.",
          "description":"Fill a spray bottle with water and add a few drops of dish soap. Shake the bottle to combine the mixture, and then spray it on the leaves. Spray the leaves once every couple of days for 2 weeks. This should get rid of the pests.Some people choose to add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the soap and water mixture. It\u2019s possible that this might make it more effective. If you have a spray bottle attachment that goes on your hose, you can certainly use that to spray your tree. This should work on multiple pests unless you have a large infestation, in which case you'll need to try additional treatments."

        {
          "headline":"Dust the leaves with flour if water and soap don't work.",
          "description":"Basic flour from your kitchen is fine, and you can just sprinkle it on the leaves. There\u2019s no need to wipe it off. If you still see pests in a few days, you can try other sprays.This can work on aphids and mites, but won't work on fruit flies or borers since they don't live on leaves."

          "headline":"Harvest your fruit early if you have a fly infestation.",
          "description":"If you spot damaged cherries, it\u2019s likely too late to prevent an infestation, but you can pick all of the cherries that look healthy and don\u2019t have holes. Pick the damaged fruit, too, but keep it separate. Seal the damaged fruit in a plastic bag and dispose of it far away from your trees. This will keep the flies from spreading.To prevent the flies from coming back next season, you can try spraying your tree with a half and half mixture of water and apple cider vinegar at the beginning of the growing season."

          "description":"Healthy trees are less susceptible to infestations. Sometimes you might not be able to see pests, but you can tell that some leaves don\u2019t look healthy. If you notice leaves that are curled, spotted, or look otherwise unhealthy, pick them off of your tree. If it\u2019s too many for you to pick, contact a local garden center to ask about other treatment options.If you see sick-looking leaves on the ground, gather them up and safely burn them. If you leave them on the ground, they can keep hosting pests that could migrate to your tree. Clean up old leaves and fruit in the fall so that they don\u2019t rot, which can attract a variety of pests."
