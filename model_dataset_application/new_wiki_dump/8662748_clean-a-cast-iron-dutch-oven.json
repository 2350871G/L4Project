          "description":"If the cast iron isn\u2019t all that dirty and you use it a lot, simply pour in enough cooking oil to coat the insides. Then use cloth or paper towels to wipe away any loose bits of food. Use fresh paper towels to wipe away any excess oil. If it looks clean after that, that\u2019s all you need to do, so call it a day! Cast iron becomes sterilized once it reaches 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), which should only take a couple minutes the next time you use it. However, if you don\u2019t use your Dutch oven frequently, it\u2019s a good idea to give it a more thorough wash than this. The cooking oil may turn rancid after a few days of non-use."

A popular myth is that you should never, ever use soap on cast iron.

Use cloth or paper towels to scrub the abrasive salt around to loosen and dislodge the scorched bits. Then repeat either Step 1 or 2 to remove the salt and loosened crud. The heat from the burner should also help loosen the crud as you work.

If the rusted area was relatively minor, rinse it with warm water, dry it off, and then wipe it with cooking oil. If the rust returns soon afterwards, or if the affected area was pretty large, you will need to reseason your Dutch oven."
