Sweep up the feces and dispose of it. Check the spot daily to see if more fecal pellets appear. If they do, then this is a sure sign that you have an infestation."

These tunnels are usually the size of a pen, but they can also be slightly larger or smaller. If your home's foundation is made of hollow concrete blocks, you might not be able to see the termite tunnels. You'll need to look for the tunnels above the foundation instead.

Worker termites are small and appear white or translucent. However, the absence of these termites does not mean that you do not have an infestation \u2014 the termites may have just moved on to somewhere else. If the tunnel is rebuilt after a few days, then this is a sure sign that you have an infestation."
