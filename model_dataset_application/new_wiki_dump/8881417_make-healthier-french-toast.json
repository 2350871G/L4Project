          "headline":"Start with multi-grain bread.",
          "description":"Ditch the overly processed bread products and find a more natural option complete with nutritious whole grains. These not only have more beneficial vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber, but they\u2019ll also let you taste the bread more clearly underneath the heavy coating of sweeteners and other toppings. You could even start making your own bread from scratch, which will give you total control over what goes in it. Low carb breads made without gluten are also a good way to avoid overloading on starches."

        {
          "headline":"Use just the egg whites.",
          "description":"Separating the whites instead of using the whole egg significantly reduces the amount of cholesterol and overall calories going into the dish. Keep in mind that you may need to crack a few extra eggs to make up for volume you lose by not including the yolks. Isolating the whites may prevent your French toast from tasting so \u201ceggy,\u201d as well. To simplify the cooking process, pick up a bottle of egg white beaters from the supermarket to keep on hand for hassle-free breakfasts."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add a scoop of protein powder.",
          "description":"Shake in 20-30g of unflavored powder while you\u2019re mixing up the batter. The added protein will help you feel satisfied faster, which means you\u2019ll eat less and keep your muscles fueled and ready to burn energy all day long. Enriching your French toast with protein can keep you from having to serve fattening side dishes like bacon or sausage alongside it in order to fill up. Avoid flavored protein powders, as these will interfere with the finished product."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Go with a lighter sweetener.",
          "description":"Opt for a low sugar variety of maple syrup, or, better yet, make the switch to raw honey. These items contain far lower concentrations of sugar without sacrificing the smooth, rich sweetness you need to make the dish taste right. A good serving size for syrup and other sweeteners is around 1-2 tablespoons, or about 30ml. There is evidence to suggest that maple syrup may have certain health benefits, so consider simply going easy on it rather than giving it up altogether. Lend depth to your French toast using sweeteners with complex flavors like orange blossom honey or date syrup infused with fruity or floral notes."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pass on the powdered sugar.",
          "description":"Sprinkling on a healthy dose of confectioner\u2019s sugar is usually the last step in preparing French toast, but it adds a lot of unnecessary calories. Stick to a low sugar syrup, honey or fruit to sweeten your breakfast rather than overpowering it with extra sugar. Chances are, you won\u2019t even miss it when it\u2019s not there. Instead of powdered sugar, try a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg or allspice. These spices are bold and help promote a healthy metabolism."

In fact, a fruit compote can even be used to replace other sweeteners altogether. Combine your favorite jam or preserves with a little bit of water to make a spreadable fruit topping, or simply reduce a few cups of juice in a saucepan until it thickens into a syrup. If you\u2019re in a hurry, ordinary apple sauce can make a great readymade topping for French toast."

          "description":"Heap your hot-off-the-skillet toast with a generous dollop of yogurt and dig in. Greek yogurt is high in protein, along with other essential nutrients like calcium and vitamin D. It also provides a cool, creamy counterbalance to the soft and slightly crisp texture of the cooked bread. Cut the sharp flavor of Greek yogurt by stirring in a small amount of honey or simple syrup. Ricotta, cottage or cream cheese are among a few other delicious dairy options, if you don\u2019t care for the taste of Greek yogurt."

Nuts are good sources of protein, minerals and healthy fatty acids like Omega-3s. For this reason, they\u2019re a smarter pick than additives like Nutella, which tend to be loaded with sugar. Have your nut butters ground fresh in the store as opposed to buying the processed brands. These usually have sweeteners added."

A little bit of chocolate can make your breakfast feel more like dessert. Melt the chocolate in the microwave and drizzle it over the toast, followed by a glob of homemade whipped cream or infused butter. Dark chocolate pairs well with lots of other unique ingredients, from raspberry to coconut."

Aim for a thickness of about \u00bd to \u00be inch per slice, about half as much as usual. Be sure to adjust your cooking time appropriately so that the thinner toast doesn\u2019t burn. It may help to choose a sturdier bread, like focaccia or soda bread, that can hold up to being dipped and cooked without falling apart.
