          "description":"Water is crucial. It allows your body to cool itself down and keep its interior temperature regulated. If you don\u2019t stay hydrated\u2014especially if you\u2019re working or playing sports outdoors in the sun\u2014you\u2019re likely to get dehydrated. Adult men should drink at least 15.5 cups (3.7 L) of water each day, while adult women should drink 11.5 cups (2.7 L). If you don\u2019t have access to water, other liquids like coffee, tea, sports drinks, juice, or soda are better than nothing. Coffee can in fact dehydrate your body over the course of a day, though."

          "description":"If you\u2019re outdoors for the day and the heat is getting to you, spray the exposed skin on your face, arms, neck, and torso with water from a small spray bottle. Not only will the cool water feel good against your warm skin, but, as air circulates and blows across the dampened surfaces of your body, it will carry the heat away. If you\u2019re concerned that friends or family members may be overheating as well, plan ahead and bring a water-filled spray bottle for them."

          "description":"It\u2019s easy to overheat when you\u2019re running, working, playing sports, or otherwise being active outside. To cool off, simply stop the physical action and take a break. If possible, sit down in a shady location. Drink some water and wait for 20-30 minutes until your body has had a chance to cool down. You can tell that you\u2019re overheating if you start to feel dizzy, faint, or find yourself sweating nonstop. If you don\u2019t stop performing a physical activity when you feel your body start to overheat, you\u2019ll risk heat exhaustion and, in extreme cases, heat stroke."

          "description":"If you\u2019re spending time outdoors and need to cool down in a hurry, run cool water over a hand towel or bandana. Wring any excess water out of the fabric and tie the towel or bandana around your head. Also try wetting your t-shirt around the neck and chest. The cool water will quickly lower your body temperature, even on the hottest days. The towel or bandana will dry out in 1-2 hours, so reapply water as needed. This is also a useful trick if you\u2019re driving cross country without air conditioning."

This will allow your body to lose heat throughout the day. Also wear light-colored clothing that won\u2019t absorb heat from the sun\u2019s rays. Lightweight fabrics include cotton, linen, gingham, and seersucker. So, instead of wearing dark blue jeans and a nylon jacket, try wearing cotton shorts and a white linen shirt."

Rather than running the AC during the heat of the day, try cooling down your home as much as possible at night. If you\u2019re trying to save money on your electric bill, set your AC to 3-4 degrees warmer than you\u2019d usually have it set."

To cool down in a hurry, wet a bandana or washcloth with tepid water, then wring it out so it\u2019s not dripping wet. Hold the cloth to 1 or more of these cooling spots for 5-10 minutes. Try holding the wet cloth to your wrists, neck, inner elbow, groin, inner knee, or feet. If you\u2019re fully dressed, try taking off your socks and shoes so you can apply a wet cloth to your feet and ankles."

Open a couple of windows on opposite sides of the house in the evening, and set 1 box fan or swiveling fan in front of each one. Also try putting 1-2 fans in hallways or doorways to circulate outdoor air through the rooms of your home. The moving air through your home will also evaporate sweat from your skin, which lowers body temperature."

Then, once the sun has set and the air outside is cooler than inside, open the shades and windows. This will allow the warm air inside to escape and let cool outside air come in."

To keep yourself out of the heat, spend as much time as possible on the cooler lower floor of your home, whether it\u2019s a finished basement or the ground floor. As the upper floor(s) heat up, the lower floor will remain relatively cool. If you live on a home with a single floor, this step won\u2019t apply to you."
