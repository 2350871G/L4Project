      "description":"Artist trading cards are generally  2 \u20442 inches (6.4 cm)  by  3 1/2  inches. This allows them to fit into the plastic sleeves in which they are stored. You can then use the plastic card holders in a binder to bring to a trade and store in your own binder collection. This is the size of hockey cards and other trading cards. You can even start with mismatched playing cards as a base for collage or altered item artwork."

      "description":"You don't need to be careless when making an ATC, but there's no need to work your masterpiece in miniature, either. ATCs should be simple pieces that you're willing to give away when you're done. It is suggested 15 minute per card so you will want to trade them."

      "description":"The whole point of ATCs is to trade with other artists, so once you have a selection of cards, trade them.Find artists or groups in your area that trade cards. The idea is to trade in person. Attend gatherings of artists in your area, and remind them to bring ATCs to share. Carry them with you as you would business cards, so that if you find an occasion to trade or give away a card, they are with you. Spread the word. If your local artist community is unfamiliar with artist trading cards, you might wish to give away a few cards or offer them with a request for one in return before you get many back. Organize a gathering to swap ATCs. Let people know what ATCs are about, and get together to try trading some. Look on-line. There are on-line groups that will match you up with others the world over who can mail cards in exchange for yours."
