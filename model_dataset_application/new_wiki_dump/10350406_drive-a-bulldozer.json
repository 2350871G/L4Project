When checking the engine coolant, you'll want to make sure the engine is cooled down to prevent hot fluid from spraying up. Look at the owner's manual for specifications on the appropriate levels for each fluid and how to check them if you are uncertain. Most hydraulic tanks will have a sight check gauge which takes a simple look to know where the level is at. Each fluid will have its own gauge or dipstick to check the levels.

Operating the Blade and Ripper Move the right joystick forward or backward to control the height of the blade. Grab the joystick with your right hand and move it forward to lower the blade. If you want to raise the blade, move the joystick backward with your hand. The blade should move up and down smoothly without jerking. Don\u2019t put the blade on the ground until you are ready to push dirt. Move the right joystick horizontally to control the tilt of the blade.
