Look on your state government\u2019s website or contact the Department of Energy to find a list of local vendors who you can contact to pick up your tubes for you. Note that some of these vendors may require you have to a minimum number of tubes to be disposed of, such as 10 pounds (4.5 kg) worth.

The cost of shipping will vary based on your area and vendor, but it will probably be about $1 per lamp.
