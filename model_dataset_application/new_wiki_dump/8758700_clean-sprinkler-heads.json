  "text":" Clearing Debris Wipe the sprinkler head clean. Disconnect  the unit from the water hose. Use a dry cloth to wipe the head of your sprinkler. Wipe it clean of any dirt, mud, silt, or other organic material. Inspect the sprinkler head.

Removing Rust and Mineral Buildup Place the sprinkler head in a bucket. Disconnect the sprinkler head. Place it into a bucket or plastic bag.
