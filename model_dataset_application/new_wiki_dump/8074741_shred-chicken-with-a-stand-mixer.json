          "description":"Shredding the chicken with a mixer is only possible if it\u2019s warm. There are many ways of preparing chicken for shredding. For instance, you could bake it in the oven at a temperature of 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 Celsius) for about 30 to 40 minutes. If you don\u2019t want to cook your chicken in the oven, try boiling it. Finally, you could pan-simmer your chicken on the range in oil. To boil the chicken, just drop the chicken into water and heat to boiling. Cover, reduce heat to low, and wait 90 minutes. To pan-simmer your chicken, just place it in oil at a medium-high temperature for one minute, flip it, and reduce the temperature to low. Cover and let it simmer about 10 minutes. No matter what method you choose, ensure you follow proper safety protocols. For instance, always use antibacterial soap to clean the cutting boards and other surfaces that may have come into contact with the raw chicken, and wash your hands thoroughly after preparing your chicken. Choose the right kind of chicken. Shredding chicken in a stand mixer requires that it is free of bones. Bone-free chicken breasts or thighs are the best option for shredding chicken in a stand mixer."

Rather, pull straight away relative to the plane of the bowl or plate the chicken is on.

This is normal. Pierce the chicken again with the second fork and continue to tear away chicken meat.

Move the mixer around the bowl until the chicken is fully shredded (usually about 60 seconds or less). Keep the mixing paddles in the bowl while they\u2019re moving, otherwise you\u2019ll end up flinging chicken all over your kitchen.
