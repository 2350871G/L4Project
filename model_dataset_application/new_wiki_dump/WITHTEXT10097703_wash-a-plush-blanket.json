Allow the soap to soak in for 10 minutes, then blot it gently with a wet paper towel to remove as much of the stain as possible. To lift away greasy or oily residue, try sprinkling a small amount of corn starch onto the stain and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes. It will absorb the oils in the stain, after which you can simply wipe it off. Avoid scrubbing at stains too forcefully. Doing so could just end up spreading them around and making them worse."

When thrown in with other items, they have a tendency to rub together, which leads to matting, pilling, and other problems that can leave your blanket feeling less than comfortable. If you need to wash multiple blankets, separate them by material and color to minimize friction and prevent them from bleeding dye onto one another."

During the gentle cycle, the machine\u2019s agitator will slowly whisk your blanket back and forth, cleaning it without roughing it up. An added benefit of going with the gentle cycle is that it's shorter than the other cycles, which means you\u2019ll be back bundled up under your favorite blanket in less time."

Most fleece blankets are designed to be stain-resistant, so a basic soap-and-water combo will usually be more than enough to get them nice and clean. Fabric softeners can actually damage fabrics that have been treated with water-repellent finishes, so it\u2019s best to forego these products."

You can also lay out a just-washed blanket on your bed or an ironing board and leave it overnight. This is arguably the best way to dry fabrics like fleece, as it restores them to their original softness with no risk of heat-related mishaps.

Still, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on your blanket as it makes its rounds so you can take it out as soon as it\u2019s done. The less time it spends in the dryer, the less unnecessary wear and tear it will receive.

It\u2019s also possible for higher temperatures to scorch synthetic fabrics like polyester and acrylic, if you\u2019re not careful. It will take longer for your blanket to dry completely on a lower heat setting, but it\u2019s the best way to keep it looking and feeling new. If you want, you can toss a dryer sheet in with your blanket to infuse it with a fresh, clean scent. While liquid fabric softeners should be avoided, dryer sheets won't cause harm to delicate fabrics like fleece."
