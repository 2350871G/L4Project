Minimize their risk of illness by having another person care for them while you clean the chitterlings. Avoid touching or holding your baby while handling the raw chitterlings to prevent spreading bacteria. You should also take care to clean any baby bottles, kid food storage, or place mats that may come into contact with the chitterlings."
