It is also possible to use a chamomile teabag to make the spray. To do this, take a teabag and pour boiling water over it, following the manufacturer's instructions. This is just the same as making a cup of tea (and is what the images show).The amount of chamomile is dependent on how much you need for use in your garden. The ratio is about one part fresh chamomile flowers to three parts water and slightly less for dried flowers (which are more potent)."
