      "description":"Those amendments are normally found in fertilizer. The side of the bag lists a ratio such as \"10-10-10\" that identifies the relative amounts of NPK found in the bag (that's nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)). If you are an organic gardener, use organic fertilizers in your garden, as well as compost."

      "headline":"Clay soil may also need some secondary macronutrients, such as calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), and  magnesium (Mg).",
      "description":"These nutrients can be side dressed on your plants as needed. Purchase sulfur at your local nursery. Calcium can be found in eggshells. Just crush them up and sprinkle them around your plants. Epsom salts contains magnesium. Make a mixture of 1 tablespoon of Epsom salts to 1 quart of warm water, mix well and spray your plants with the mixture. Tomatoes and peppers especially like the mixture. It will encourage those plants to set blossom more quickly."

      "description":"Lasagna gardening is a no-till method for preparing soil and it helps to break down clay soil. This method uses layers of material, such as shredded black-and-white newspaper, compost, and coir. You build multiple layers as deep as possible and allow them to break down over time. There is detailed information on this subject to be found online. Some additional items you can add to your lasagna beds:\nGrass clippings\nLeaves\nFruit and vegetable scraps\nCoffee grounds\nTea leaves and tea bags\nWeeds (if they haven't gone to seed)\nManure\nCompost\nSeaweed\nShredded newspaper or junk mail\nPine needles\nSpent blooms, trimmings from the garden"
