If you have firewood that you use regularly, store it off the ground and keep it covered with a tarp.Warning: Check your city\u2019s ordinances before burning a pile of wood.

If you can\u2019t mow your lawn yourself, hire someone to do it for you regularly. Depending on where you live and what time of year it is, you may need to mow the grass more often than once a week.

If your mower doesn\u2019t have a bag, use a rake to collect the clippings after you mow. If you do have a compost pile, make sure it\u2019s located as far away from your home as possible.

No matter what you do, millipedes will live in mulch. By keeping it away from your home, you reduce the chances of them finding their way indoors. By making sure it isn\u2019t too thick, you reduce the number of millipedes that will be living there. If you do garden, you\u2019ll have some millipedes outside of your home.

From there, they can find cracks in the foundation and get inside. Use a gutter system that encourages rainfall to head away from your home to reduce this risk. For an eco-friendly option, consider collecting rainfall in barrels and repurposing it to water your garden or wash your car."
