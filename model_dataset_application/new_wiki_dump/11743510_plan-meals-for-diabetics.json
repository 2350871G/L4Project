If you find that certain meals raise post-meal blood glucose more aggressively, find subtle ways to modify those recipes without sacrificing flavor.

          "description":"Generally, choose a balanced array of ingredients\u2014some of which have a higher GI and some of which have a higher glycemic load. This helps prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia that results from an inconsistent release of glucose into the bloodstream during digestion. Glycemic index is a numerical score (0-100) that indicates how rapidly a food will make your blood glucose level rise. Foods containing simple carbohydrates, such as fruits, fruit juices, and sodas, have a GI closer to 100, while foods higher in fiber and/or fats, such as non-starchy vegetables, cheese, and whole milk fat yogurt have a lower GI. Glycemic load, unlike GI, measures the overall effect a food has on blood glucose level\u2014how far blood glucose will rise after eating. Glycemic load is calculated by dividing the GI by 100, then multiplying that quotient by the number of grams of carbohydrates in a typical serving of the ingredient in question. For example, watermelon has a GI of ~80 but a glycemic load of only ~5 . To balance the glycemic impact of eating watermelon, pair it with a healthy fat source, such as olive oil and feta cheese. Garnish the mixture with mint leaves, and you have a delicious salad to pair with grilled chicken or fish."

          "description":"White breads, sodas, fruit juice cocktails, and even pre-made smoothies are full of simple carbohydrates that spike blood glucose severely and metabolize quickly, lending to the risk of hypoglycemia later in the insulin duration, or action period. Bear in mind that different types of the same product may impact blood glucose drastically differently. For example, making oatmeal from a canister of unsweetened rolled oats provides a sustained release of carbohydrates into the bloodstream, while a flavored microwaveable packet of oatmeal likely contains added sugars that may elevate blood glucose more rapidly."
