You can skip this if you added red fruit juice, but the fruit will add additional flavor and a fresh appearance. Let frozen fruit thaw for a few minutes first. Raspberries add much more color than strawberries. Frozen raspberries add more than fresh raspberries, since the ice crystals rupture the fruit."
