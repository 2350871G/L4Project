          "description":"If you have a room that has long walls paired with shorter walls, creating a narrow space, it's best to create your focal point for the room on the long wall. If you try to place it on the narrower wall, the room will look even bigger than it already does. A focal point can be an entertainment center or it can be a large piece like a painting. Basically, it's what the attention is focused on in your space."

          "description":"This tactic works particularly well if the wall is oddly shaped or if it has objects dividing it. Designate 2 or 3 \"areas\" on the wall, and treat each one like its own wall. You can use groupings of pictures or different textiles to create different sections. It helps if the areas you create coordinate with other things in the room or hallway, such as creating one area for the dining room and one for the living room on a common wall."

          "description":"A long hallway or room that's also narrow doesn't leave much room for decoration, so sometimes, your best bet is to add some paint. One tactic is to create horizontal lines along the walls, either with well-divided stripes or something more free-form, such as organic, wave-like lines. These stripes go along the whole length of the wall, and this method can create the illusion of more space."

For instance, you could paint a mural or even create a funky cross-stitch pattern on your wall, based on a pattern you buy at a sewing store. You could also create a fun color-blocking pattern that you've marked off in a square or rectangle. For instance, try a starburst in varying colors, and then outline the whole thing in a white or black rectangle."

Once you paint the wall, you can draw on it with chalk or chalk pens. Alternatively, let your kids go to town on the wall. You could add inspirational quotes or create a fun, changing landscape."

When all your decorations are flat against the wall, the effect can be flat as well. However, adding 3D art can give the wall texture and depth, making it more interesting, because it pulls the decorations partially out from the wall..\nFor instance, try displaying a collection of plates that come out from the wall, or use large fake silk flowers to cover part of the wall. You could also hang thin decorative lights from the ceiling near the wall to bring the decorations out from the wall. Paintings that are partially sculptures, meaning they have 3D aspects to them, also work well."

However, if those options are too expensive, opt for a decorative (hemmed) fabric or even a cheap sheet. Keep in mind that larger prints will work better for a wall. Also, be sure to iron the fabric first. You can use a tapestry rod to hang it, but if you want to go cheaper, try painting wooden dowels from a home improvement store. Create a sleeve at the top and bottom by simply turning the edge over and sewing across or using fabric glue. Insert the rods, and hang the top rod from hooks. Another option is to staple a piece of fabric over a canvas."
