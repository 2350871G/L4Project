          "description":"Mechanical light timers are normally square or rectangular and have a numbered dial on the front. Grab the outer ring of this dial between your index finger and thumb. Turn the dial clockwise until the arrow on the inner circle of the timer is pointing at the current time.Tip: It might be easiest to set your mechanical light timer at exactly an even hour so you can be more precise about the time. For example, it\u2019s easier to set the dial to exactly 4:00 PM than it is to set it to 3:57 PM. Depending on your make and model of timer, there might be lines that indicate intervals of 15 or 30 minutes, or the ring might just be marked with hours. Try to get as close as you can to the current time. Most mechanical light timers have instructions for how to set them on the back, so refer to these instructions if you need any additional help. The majority of mechanical light timers function the same way. However, refer to the instructions for your specific model if it seems to work differently."

Press down a button on this outer ring that is next to the hour and fraction of the hour at which you want a light to turn on.For example, if you want to schedule your light to turn on at 5:00 PM, press the button down that is right next to the 5:00 PM arrow on the ring. If you want it to turn on at 5:30 PM, press down the button that is halfway between the 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM arrows."

This will make it so the light turns off at 4:59 AM. If you make a mistake or want to change the scheduled on and off times, you can just pull the buttons up."
