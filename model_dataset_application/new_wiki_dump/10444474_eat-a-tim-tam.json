Take a second small bite in the corner that is diagonally opposite your first bite. Bite far enough into the Tim Tam to reveal the chocolate layers. This will make it easier to slurp the beverage through the biscuit."

The drink will melt the middle of the Tim Tam, releasing delicious chocolate goo into your mouth. The process can be a bit messy once the chocolate starts to melt so keep a paper towel on hand. The Tim Tam will quickly start to absorb the liquid so you will need to suck the drink quite swiftly. You will likely only be able to get 1 slurp from each Tim Tam before it melts. If your beverage is really hot, wait a few minutes for it to cool before attempting to drink it quickly."
