Places are more likely to be full of patrons on the weekends or during the summer when children are not in school.

Try to sit somewhere high up whenever possible. Balconies and rooftops are the ideal spots in a building."

Take a notebook and a pencil with you when you people watch to write down any great observations or insights that you notice as you observe people. Be subtle as you write things down.
