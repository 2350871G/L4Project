Eliminate the trailing ants and their trail with soapy water, all-purpose cleaner, or a bleach solution. This will kill the ants and remove their pheromone smell so that other ants don\u2019t follow.

Borax is a detergent, which you can find in the laundry aisle. Diatomaceous earth is made up of crushed fossilized skeletons. Although it's harmful to ants, it's nontoxic for humans and pets. Alternatively, you can place a little borax or diatomaceous earth inside your vacuum cleaner chamber, then vacuum up the ants.

After the ants ingest the bait, it will kill them. All you need to do is wait. Place your baits in areas the ants frequent, such as under your water pipes, in your pantry, or at the corner of your counter. Replace the baits after they dry out, which can occur in 1-3 months depending on the brand. Read the label to find out how long the baits typically last.

Sprinkle the mixture around areas the ants frequent, such as around water pipes, in the back of the pantry, or just inside the door. Keep children and pets away from the mixture, as it\u2019s toxic. If you have children and pets, a safe way to use the bait is to seal it up in a jar. Punch 2-3 tiny holes in the lid of the jar so that the ants can get inside. Then, seal the lid. Avoid spraying repellants around the bait, as this will keep the ants from getting it. Remove the bait after you don\u2019t see ants for a while, as leaving it out could attract new ants."

Replace the baits when they dry out, which can occur within a few days. You should change it at least once a week until the ant problem is under control.

This is about 60% effective at killing off the colony, so you may need to repeat the process a few days later. If you use soapy boiling water, you can increase the effectiveness to 60-70%.
