Try to find a time when neither of you are stressed out, when you\u2019re both relaxed and calm, and in good moods. Waiting until the weekend when you are both decompressed from work is an ideal time. The best time to approach the subject is when it is just the two of you. Attempting to convince your spouse to do something in a group setting or when others are around may seem like you are trying to put them on the spot and make them be agreeable so they won't embarrass themselves in front of others. Your spouse will likely become defensive and may even feel betrayed. Instead, begin the conversation when you\u2019re having a nice dinner or when you are relaxing on the couch. You might say something like, \"Can we get dinner tonight? There's something I'd like to discuss with you.\" If your spouse is a football fanatic and there's a big game on that night, then it might be a good idea to talk the next day. Choose a time when neither of you will be distracted and can focus."

It may be helpful to write down your spouse\u2019s responses to each of your topics.

Being open with your spouse about them could sway their thinking.

Be sure to mention every advantage you can think of. These can include better schools, shorter commute to work, being closer to family or friends, or a safer neighborhood. If you want to move to a smaller home, bring up how your mortgage or rent is likely cheaper each month, how you\u2019ll pay less for utilities, and how you may not have to do as much yardwork. If you and your spouse have long-term goals, talk about how moving can help you achieve them. For instance, paying a lower mortgage can help you save for early retirement, or moving closer to your extended family means your parents can help watch your kids, saving you money on daycare and babysitters."
