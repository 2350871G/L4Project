          "description":"When you are cleaning a stain from inside your enamel glazed pot or pan, you can speed up the process by boiling water in the pan. You only need enough water to cover the surface covered with the stain and allow for evaporation when boiling. This method works well on food stains, but is not especially effective on rust. This method eliminates the need for an overnight soak."

Simmer the mixture for a few minutes. Reduce the heat to a lower setting and allow the baking soda mixture to simmer in the cookware for several minutes. After it has simmered for a few minutes, turn off the heat. Baking soda is mildly abrasive, but only enough to help scrape away the stain. It is safe to use on your enamel cookware.
