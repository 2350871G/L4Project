          "description":"Whether you are decorating a bedroom, lounge, or a whole house, the area will look more mid-century modern if it is free from clutter. Remove any unnecessary items from surfaces, such as desks, benches, or tables. File any loose pieces of paper, throw out any rubbish, and keep books and magazines in one place. Place small objects, such as art supplies, stationery, or cleaning products, into boxes or cupboards. Consider giving away any objects that don\u2019t fit with the mid-century modern theme, such as any neon or sparkly items. Keep items like sturdy wooden frames and hardcover books. Just prepare to use them strategically. Place a few candles on a dresser rather than a myriad of ornaments."

          "headline":"Paint the walls white and add a feature wall if you want a dash of colour.",
          "description":"The majority of mid-century modern homes have white walls as this allows the statement pieces of furniture to stand out. Paint the interior walls white and if you want to brighten up a room, paint one wall a different colour. For example, paint 3 walls in the dining room white and paint 1 wall pale pink. If you don\u2019t like white, consider other neutral tones, such as light cream or grey. The exception to this is areas where you have wooden wall panels, brick walls, or large feature windows. These were often centerpieces in mid-century homes and should be displayed and enhanced, not covered up. Consider using wallpaper for your feature wall if you want it to have texture or pattern."

          "description":"Most houses get at least some light during the day. Make the most of the light to help create a mid-century modern feel. During the day, open all of the curtains in the house. If you want some privacy during the day, consider purchasing sheer curtains. These give a light and breezy feel to the house whilst still giving privacy. If there are any tall trees or hedges that are blocking the light shining through the windows, trim them back."

          "description":"A key focus of mid-century modern design is including wood into the home. Consider adding wooden flooring, a wooden bench top, or wooden doors to your house. Oak, walnut, and teak are popular types of wood used in mid-century modern design. Use wooden laminate instead of wood to achieve a similar look at a cheaper price. Wooden decor pieces such as wooden balls, wooden furniture legs and backs, and wood doors were all prevalent in mid-century homes."

Pick a couch that has relatively straight arms and tall tapered legs instead of a couch with ornate rounded edges. Choose a bold colour to help the couch stand out. A sea-blue couch paired with mustard cushions would be a great colour choice. If a new couch doesn\u2019t fit in your budget, consider adding a colourful throw to your current couch. You can replace your couch's current legs with the quintessentially mid-century tapered wooden legs. These are available affordably from most home improvement stores, as well as online."

Consider choosing a sunburst mirror. These are an iconic accessory of the mid-century era. Find replicas online to save money, or search in thrift stores. Alternatively, look for a mirror with a minimalist aesthetic. A large, circular mirror with a thin gold frame would also be great for a mid-century home. Upcycle any mirrors you already have. If you have a mirror with a frame, repaint the frame to match the feature wall or lounge suite colours."

          "description":"Lighting is a key feature of the mid-century style. Choose lamps with thin stems to incorporate the clean and minimal lines of mid-century design. Pick pendants that attract focus and have sculptural elements. Look for floor lamps that arch over furniture. Choose bulbs that have more yellow tones rather than blue tones as this will create a softer look. Consider using multiple lamps per room to create different pockets of light. Limit pendants to one per room as they are a dominant feature. Look for pendants and lamps at garage sales to find unique designs at a bargain price."

Consider adding a wooden coffee table, wooden chairs, or wooden shelves. If you want more minimal amounts of wood, choose a couch with wooden legs. If you have wooden furniture that has been painted, consider sanding off the paint to expose the natural wood. Don\u2019t be afraid to use laminate. This can create a wooden look at a lower price. Look out for wooden furniture in thrift shops. This is a great way to get quality furniture at a lower price."

It is best to pick a few favourite pieces for the walls in each room. Large graphics painted with oil on canvas are a great mid-century option. Metal wall plaques fit with the theme. Abstract metal and stone sculptures are also good artistic accessories for this style."

Consider adding plants at different levels to bring a natural look. For example, place one plant in a hanging basket and another on a coffee table. Peace lilies are a timeless looking plant that improve air quality. Cacti are another timeless option. Plants with hanging vines or droopy leaves work best in hanging baskets. Plants are integral to the mid-century look. If you can't keep real plants in your home, invest in some fake plants to get the look."

Add patterned cushions to your bed or couch to bring detail and color to the rooms. Alternatively, pick a patterned bedspread that makes the bed the focal point of the room. Avoid having patterns on both the bedspread and decorative pillows. Similarly, avoid pairing a patterned couch with patterned cushions. Patterns look best when paired with plain items. Consider buying fabric and then the sewing cushion covers or bedspread yourself. This is a great way to find the pattern you want and save money. If you can\u2019t sew, ask a friend or family member that has good sewing skills to help you."

Try to get a neutral-colored rug so that you don\u2019t draw away from the furniture in the room. A shaggy rug would work well in a space with a velvet couch. Sisal and jute rugs also compliment this style and are very durable. Purchase a rug from a home department store or keep an eye out at garage sales."
