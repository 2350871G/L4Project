Spray the rack liberally with cooking spray, place it into the roasting pan, then lay the pork loin on the rack. Use a shallow-sided roasting pan, if possible.

If it\u2019s under 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C), return the pork loin to the oven and check it again in 5 minutes.

A 4 oz (110 g) serving of this roast has under 200 calories, 7 g of fat, and 3 g of saturated fat, and just over 500 mg of sodium.
