  "text":" Baking the Brownies Gather your ingredients and materials for baking, listed above.  Mix all the dry ingredients together in a large, dry bowl. As you mix them, slowly add the liquid-like ingredients such as the milk, softened butter, and eggs. Mix until the mixture has a thick, pudding-like consistency. Grease your pan lightly with olive, sunflower, or vegetable oil or butter/margarine. Make sure that it is even, or the brownies may stick to the sides and burn to the pan. Pour the brownie batter evenly into a pan. If you prefer to add candy or chocolate chips to go with the Halloween theme, make sure that they will not get in the way of making the ghost designs. Bake the brownies for around twenty-five minutes. If you are not sure if the brownies are ready, conduct the toothpick test near the center of the brownie pan. If the toothpick comes out clean, the brownies are done. Allow the brownies to cool for a little while. Once they cool, cut the brownies into rectangle or square pieces. Making the Ghost Design Create or print a ghost template. This is like a stencil for the ghost shape, so make sure that it is small enough to fit into each brownie. In order to ensure that your ghost is shaped properly, it is best to use a template to guide your decorating. Simply draw a ghost on a piece of paper before carefully cutting out the shape with a pair of scissors. Place the ghost template onto the brownie. Center it as best as you can, so that it does not have part of it not appear on the brownie. Sprinkle the icing sugar inside the template. Be sure that you use a moderate amount, ensuring that you cover the entire shape of the ghost. However, limit yourself in order to prevent uneven mounds of sugar on the brownie. To fix these, scrape off the sugar with a spoon or butter knife. Remove the template. Slowly lift it up, making sure that the icing sugar remains on the brownie. If your movements disturb the sugar, you may have to start over. Repeat the steps above. Continue sprinkling powdered sugar on the remaining brownies. Finished. ",
