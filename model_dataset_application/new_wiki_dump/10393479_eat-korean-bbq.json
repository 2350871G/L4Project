          "description":"Korean BBQ is an all-you-can-eat style, but it is not a buffet, meaning that you will order food from a server who brings it to your table. Different restaurants have different payment methods, so check ahead of time to see if you will be expected to pay a flat rate per person or pay for each course. Your server will have great advice for people new to Korean BBQ, so don't be afraid to ask them any questions you have about the cuisine. You can expect to spend up to 2 hours at a Korean BBQ restaurant if you want to get the full experience, try every meat, and drink to your heart's content. Some Korean BBQ experts suggest bringing cash rather than using your card, as it can be difficult for your server to split a bill between multiple guests on cards."

The center of the grill is hottest and is where you cook meats, while the edges of the center are used to keep food warm before eating. Your server will bring you your food unheated and you will use the grill in the middle of your table to prepare everything. Korean BBQ is an all-you-can-eat style cuisine, but it is not the same as a buffet. It is not disrespectful at all to request a cleaner grill if yours becomes grimy and charred \u2014 the restaurant wants you to have the most authentic and delicious experience possible."

Most upscale Korean BBQ places will do this without asking you first, to ensure you get the best quality meat possible. If they insist, be their guest."

If you want to pour your own drink, nobody will call you out for it, but an authentic Korean BBQ experience is one based on sharing with others. Wait for your friends to fill your drink, or if you are impatient, top everyone else's glass off to send the hint that you would like yours filled too. If you are with people who are also new to the cuisine, consider letting everybody know of this one rule for Korean BBQ \u2014 you will find that sharing drinks and taking care of each other's is a fun bonding experience!"

This can be eaten plain or marinated in garlic, miso, wine, and red pepper. Try Kalbi, a Korean marinated beef short rib. Kalbi is different from European short ribs as it is cut with the bone on the outside, rather than through the middle. Cut the Kalbi into thin strips to speed up the grilling process. Try some Bulgogi, a thinly sliced beef with a soy marinade. Often used in stir-fry, Bulgogi is a savory and relatively light meat, a good choice to start your feast with."

Soondubu Jjigae: Made with an assortment of veggies and tofu, the ingredients of this spicy soup melt in your mouth. Cold Beef Broth Noodles: Order this after you have finished your feast, so you can mix in any leftovers you have. Kalbi is particularly delicious with the cold noodles, as the heat of the meat and the cold noodles play off of each other in unexpected ways."

Kimchi: One of the more well-known Korean foods, kimchi is made with fermented cabbage as well as an assortment of veggies. It has been compared to sauerkraut and pickles. Bean sprouts: Usually dressed in a savory sauce, such as sesame oil, bean sprouts are great for a refreshing bite between meats. Seaweed salad: Seaweed is a traditional ingredient in many coastal countries, and a seaweed salad will help to offset all the meat you've eaten.

Don't worry about drinking too much, as Soju and Makgeolli have a relatively low alcohol content, while Korean beer is light like Coors or Budweiser in the U.S.\nTwo great beer brands often available at Korean BBQ restaurants are Hite and OB. These are considered to be the \"working man's beer\" of Korea. Soju is a Korean liquor that tastes sweeter than European clear liquors, but is also milder. Because of its relatively low alcohol content, it is easy and encouraged to do soju shots throughout your dining experience. Flavored soju, such as mango, peach, kiwi, and others, are often available for a little variety. Makgeolli, sometimes called Makkoli, is a slightly sparkling rice wine that is is light in alcohol but robust in flavor. A tasty choice to sip over the course of your first course."
