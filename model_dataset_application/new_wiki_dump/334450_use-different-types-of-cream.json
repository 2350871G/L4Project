          "description":"Beat 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of light cream per egg into a small bowl with the eggs. Then, scramble them as usual on the stovetop for softer, creamier eggs. Whisk the eggs and cream together until the yolk, whites, and cream are thoroughly combined. The eggs should look slightly frothy. If you want more flavor, top the eggs with fresh herbs or add salt and pepper.Tip: You can substitute equal amounts of half and half for light cream. While half and half has slightly less fat, it\u2019s close enough for cooking purposes."

          "headline":"Combine 1 part light cream with 1 part water if you need a substitute for milk.",
          "description":"If you\u2019re making a recipe that calls for milk, but you don\u2019t have any, use light cream mixed with water instead. For instance, if the recipe requires 1 cup (240 ml) of milk, mix in \u20442 cup (120 ml) of cream and \u20442 cup (120 ml) of water. For a dish that\u2019s a little creamier, like if you\u2019re making an alfredo sauce, increase the amount of cream compared to the amount of water. For example, use \u20444 cup (180 ml) of cream and \u20444 cup (59 ml) of water."

          "description":"In a small mixing bowl, whisk together 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of cream, \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of vanilla extract, 3 oz (85 g) of softened cream cheese, and 1/4 cup (30 g) of confectioners\u2019 sugar. Pour it over sliced fruit in a bowl or pretty dessert dish. You can also add or substitute different extracts based on what flavor you want. For example, you could use almond or lemon extract instead of vanilla. If you want a runnier sauce, add less cream cheese or confectioners\u2019 sugar. Or, you can add more cream until it reaches the desired consistency."

          "description":"Pour the cream into a hot cup of coffee to taste and blend it together with a spoon or stir stick. The more cream you use, the less bitter and the more buttery the coffee will taste. You can also buy flavored coffee creamers, like gingerbread or salted caramel, for instance. Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see the cream curdle in the coffee, meaning it breaks up into small chunks instead of blending smoothly. This can happen when very cold cream hits very hot, acidic coffee."

Stir in your choice of veggies, protein, grains, or flavorings. Be aware that adding acids, like white wine or lemon juice, can cause the cream to curdle.
