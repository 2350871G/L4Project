This is a sign that they are new at dealing and may make mistakes. Sloppy dealers will deal cards high off the table or may even flash a portion of the card to the players. Walk around different tables and make a mental note of any tables that have sloppy dealers. An experienced dealer will deal every hand deliberately and low to the table. If a dealer looks like a seasoned veteran, move to a different table."

If you do see a shuffling machine that is in front of where a player sits, take that seat.

Look for shufflers that hold the cards a couple of inches off the table. These shufflers will usually have a base that holds them up, which makes seeing the hole card easier. Older model ACE shufflers hold the card 3 inches (7.6 cm) off the table. These are the most exploitable shuffling machines. Look for a black shuffling machine with the logo ACE on the side of it."

So, if there is a left-handed dealer your best bet would be to sit on first base, or on their left-hand side.

If the dealer has a hard 17, they have to stand and there's no chance that you can beat them if you have under a 17. Therefore, it's best to hit even if you think you'll bust. For example, basic strategy says to stand when you have 17 and the dealer is showing an 8. However, if you know for a fact they have an ace as their hole card, you should hit anyway because there's no way for you to win or tie unless you increase your score. A hard 17 is a blackjack score that's achieved without an ace. For example, a 10 and a 7 would be a hard 17. A soft 17 is when the dealer has an ace and a 6. This means that they will continue to hit until they hit 17 or above. Different casinos will have different policies on if the dealer should hit on a hard or soft 16 or 17. Make sure to read the rules before you bet at a table."
