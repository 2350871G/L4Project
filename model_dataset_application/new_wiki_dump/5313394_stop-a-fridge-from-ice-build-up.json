          "description":"Opening the door frequently increases the humidity levels inside your fridge and freezer which can lead to ice buildup and frost. Avoid leaving your fridge or freezer doors open when you\u2019re deciding what to eat or trying to figure out which ingredients to pull out. Instead, make a quick mental list of what you\u2019ll need so you can take all of those things out at one time. Only open 1 door at a time. Be as quick as possible and close the doors in under 1 minute. For instance, if you\u2019re going to be baking, take out the eggs, butter, and milk at one time. This way, you only have to open the door once. If you have a hard time remembering what you stock in your fridge, keep a list of what\u2019s inside posted on the refrigerator door."

          "description":"If your fridge or freezer door are prone to sitting open, or if they swing wide open while you\u2019re moving food in and out, this easily can raise the humidity levels inside your appliance, causing ice to build up. Ask another person to help you pull the fridge out about 1 ft (0.30 m) from the wall. Have your partner tilt the top of the fridge backward, toward the wall, to expose the front 2 feet. While they hold it in this position, twist the legs counterclockwise. Unscrew the legs slightly to make them a little taller. This way, gravity will encourage the doors to shut. Once you\u2019ve tweaked the legs, open the doors and see if gravity help them close naturally. If not, repeat this process to lift the front legs even higher. When you\u2019re done, return the fridge back to its original spot."

          "description":"Loose hinges on your fridge or freezer doors will result in an incomplete seal; this will increase the humidity inside your appliance which may result in ice buildup. If you notice that the door or the screws on the hinges are wobbly, use a screwdriver to tighten the screws by turning them clockwise. Keep tightening them until they don\u2019t spin around anymore. Depending on the type of fridge you have, you may have to lift off a plastic cover to expose the hinges."

Working on 1 door at a time, use a damp cleaning cloth and mild dish soap to quickly scrub the inside of the seal. Clean off the frame of the fridge opening, as well, to ensure that the seal can sit flush against it. Use a dry towel to wipe off any remaining moisture and then shut the door. Make sure you don\u2019t leave any moisture behind, as it might form an ice crystal."

          "description":"Look at the flexible rubber seal on the inside of your fridge and freezer doors. These are called refrigerator gaskets. If either one appears to be damaged, replace it to ensure that your appliance\u2019s doors close completely. Contact your fridge manufacturer to order a replacement gasket. Once you have it, unplug your appliance and move all of the perishable items to coolers. Unscrew the damaged gasket and then screw the new one into place. Make sure you know your appliance\u2019s model number; you\u2019ll need this in order to get the right replacement part. Test out the seal of your new gasket before you turn the fridge back on and start loading it up. It should sit flush against the frame of the fridge or freezer opening without any gaps."
