          "description":"Cold smoked salmon refers to salmon that is smoked at any temperature lower than 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C), typically for 15 hours or more. Since the salmon is never really heated, it maintains a lot of its raw textures, and tends to be smoother than hot smoked salmon. It\u2019s most commonly-used on bagels, crackers, or consumed on its own as a simple snack.Tip: Cold smoked salmon can be consumed without cooking or heating it. Any dangerous bacteria will make the fish go bad, so as long as it\u2019s not rotting or past its expiration date, you don\u2019t need to cook it. Cold smoked salmon is often marketed as Nova. Nova is simply short for Nova Scotia, and these cold smoked salmons were caught off of the eastern shores of North America and Canada."

Hot smoked salmon is often used as an ingredient in salads, salads, and casseroles. Like cold smoked salmon, hot smoked salmon can also be consumed on its own without additional cooking.

          "description":"Lox is style of uncooked salmon that isn\u2019t actually smoked, but is often marketed alongside smoked salmon as an alternative. It\u2019s traditionally put on bagels and has a silky texture and salty flavor. Gravlax isn\u2019t smoked either, but is often sold alongside smoked salmon. It\u2019s basically lox that has been cured with spices and seasoning. These are both great alternatives if you want some smoked salmon but can\u2019t find it at your local deli or grocery store. While these salmons aren\u2019t smoked, their similarity to smoked salmon is unmistakable. You can substitute any recipe that calls for smoked salmon with lox or gravlax. Gravlax is a traditional Nordic dish, but it may be a little harder to get your hands on than lox or smoked salmon. Any Scandinavian recipes that call for gravlax can substitute cold or hot smoked salmon."
