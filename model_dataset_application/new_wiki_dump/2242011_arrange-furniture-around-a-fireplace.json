In order to promote conversation, seats should face inward and toward each other. If you plan to watch television together, seats will tend to face in one direction. Versatile seating, such as swivel chairs or light chairs that can be easily repositioned, makes it easier to rearrange the furniture for various uses."

Closely-spaced chairs are ideal for intimate conversation, while wider spacing is more suited to entertaining groups of friends who may need space to move about. A single chair makes a great space for solitary time, such as in a reading nook."

Place them in convenient locations based on their intended uses. For instance, if you have a side table that you use to hold drinks, be sure that it is located within reach of a chair that you sit in often. Avoid positioning a coffee table so it is \u201cfloating\u201d in the middle of a room. Keep it in relation to the sofa or chairs, positioned about 18\u201324 inches (46\u201361 cm) away."
