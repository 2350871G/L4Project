If you increase the amount of sugar in the recipe you\u2019ll end up with a thicker caramel. Try increasing the sugar by about 1/3. The amount of milk suggested by the recipe, then, will leave you with a thick caramel sauce. Be aware that this will also increase the sweet, caramel flavor of the sauce. If you want a caramel sauce with a milder flavor, avoid adding the extra sugar."

The whipping cream will taste the same as milk in the final product, but will produce a thicker sauce. Switching out milk for cream will result in a rich, heavy caramel sauce."
