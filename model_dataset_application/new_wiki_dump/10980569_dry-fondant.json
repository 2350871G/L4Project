          "description":"Air-drying fondant is a reliable way to avoid overdrying, but it is time-consuming. Make your fondant far enough in advance so it can be dry by the time you're ready to serve the cake. Air-drying fondant can take up to 36 hours, depending on thickness. Make your fondant 3-5 days before you plan on serving your cake to allow for adequate drying time. Set aside more drying time for homemade fondant. Homemade fondant takes several days to fully harden but can be solid enough to build on within 24 hours. If you need quicker results, consider using store-bought fondant. Store-bought fondant is typically dry within 5-24 hours, depending on thickness."

Place your baking sheet or wire rack on the top rack of your oven with the light on. Leave the oven door open slightly for air circulation\nLarger pieces may need to dry for a few hours or possibly overnight, and smaller pieces may be done within an hour or two."

Overdrying can cause cracks to form in your fondant. If cracks form, they can be smoothed out with a little bit of shortening."
