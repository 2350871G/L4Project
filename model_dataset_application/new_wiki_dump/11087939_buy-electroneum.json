          "description":"With other cryptocurrencies, you have many types of wallets to choose from. However, for Electroneum, the only wallet available is a mobile wallet offered for free by the Electroneum team. You can download the app from the Google Play or Apple App Store on your mobile phone. The wallet can be used to store Electroneum as well as mine the cryptocurrency with your mobile phone. Once you've downloaded the app, it only takes a few minutes to activate your mobile wallet. Once you complete setup and activation, you'll be rewarded with 25.00ETN (worth about 0.11USD). This reward is added to your cloud mining balance, so you'll have to activate cloud mining to eventually reap this reward. If you activate cloud mining, be careful about your data. If you want to avoid excessive data charges, you may want to turn off mining when your phone isn't connected to a WiFi network."

Assuming you're only getting the other cryptocurrency so you can trade it for Electroneum, you likely want a software wallet. There are 3 basic types of software wallets:\n\nDesktop wallets are downloaded and installed on your computer and are only accessible from that computer. They are as safe as your computer is. Mobile wallets are apps you download and install on your smartphone. They tend to be simpler and more user-friendly than desktop wallets. They're also more convenient because you can access your cryptocurrency from anywhere. Online wallets are the least secure because your information is stored on the cloud and controlled by the company that operates the wallet. While they are convenient, in that you can access them anywhere, they are also vulnerable to hacking."

Sites such as CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/electroneum) and WorldCoinIndex (https://www.worldcoinindex.com/coin/electroneum) provide exchange rates for Electroneum and various other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. You can also look at the exchange rate between Electroneum and your fiat currency if you want to first get an idea of the size of your purchase in \"real money. \"Tip: As of 2019, Electroneum is a relatively low value cryptocurrency. This means you likely won't need very much Ethereum to buy a significant amount of Electroneum. A fraction of a single Bitcoin or Ethereum coin would buy hundreds of Electroneum coins."
