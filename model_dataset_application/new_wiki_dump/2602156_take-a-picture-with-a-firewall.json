  "text":" Safety Precautions Never light the strap close to the open container of flammable fluid. Flammable fluid will be dripping off the strap when you remove it from the jug which will leave a trail of flammable fluid on the ground - this WILL catch fire! Always ALWAYS close your flammable fluid bottle. Move it far away from where your jug/starting point will be. Stay clear of ANYTHING that can catch fire, bushes, trees, grass and cars!  Keep a wet towel close by, wrap this around the strap to kill the flames.  Keep a CO2 extinguisher close by, just in case!  Once you have completed the pass you will extinguish the flame by wrapping the strap/rope in a wet towel, ensure this is prepared and ready! See the video below for an example of how to do this. Use your common sense. You do this at your own risk and that of others around you. Creating the Firewall Set up your camera, pointing to whatever your subject is.  For the composition determine where the start and end points should be for your firewall, then mark them on the road with stones so you can remember where you have to walk between.  Camera settings vary really, but a good starting point is 100ISO, F14, Shutter as long as you need.  Place your strap/rope into the jug, bearing in mind that it needs to come out untangled.  Pour the flammable fluid into the jug, ensuring all of the strap has been doused in the flammable fluid. Try not to spill any, if you do move from that area. Close your flammable fluid bottle and move it far away from where your jug/starting point will be.  Leave the strap to soak for about 2-3 minutes.
