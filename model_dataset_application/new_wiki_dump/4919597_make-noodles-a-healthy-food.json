You can even purchase something called a spiralizer to turn vegetables into perfectly coiled pieces that look just like pasta. The best part is they are vegetables so they\u2019re an extremely healthy alternative to the traditional noodle. Zucchini, cucumbers, carrots, asparagus, and any other vegetable that contains a good deal of moisture can be turned into a noodle. Even better, try spaghetti squash, and you won't need a spiralizer. Simply cut it in half, scoop out the seeds, and bake it face-down in the over for about 30 minutes. Then take a fork and rake the squash to make \"noodles.\""

          "description":"By putting flavor-rich and healthy items into your pasta you can make your dish more flavorful without needing a heavy and high-calorie sauce to make it yummy. Really robust herbs like rosemary, sage, parsley, thyme, and basil are good options for adding flavor. Try adding fresh chopped cilantro or parsley just before serving for a touch of green and great flavor."

          "headline":"Use unsaturated fats (like oils) instead of saturated fats.",
          "description":"Drenching your noodles in thick, rich and high-calorie fats (or saturated fats, like butter, milk fats, lard, and hydrogenated oils) is not the way to make noodles a healthy food. Olive oil is a great source of unsaturated (healthy) fat and can be used to add flavor to a dish. It is especially good for the development of a tasty sauce. Avoid using full-fat milk when making a pasta sauce or butter or cream. If you can't avoid creamy sauces altogether, use skim or reduced fat milks. Look up recipes for healthy pesto sauces to add great flavors to your noodles without a ton of calories. Always choose low-fat cheeses."

          "headline":"Add vegetables to bulk up your dish.",
          "description":"By bulking up your pasta dishes you can avoid unnecessarily large portion sizes, which will help you to feel full quicker without the extra calories. Load up your pasta with healthy vegetables like spinach to incorporate antioxidants. Add beans and lentils for a boost of protein. Add cooked corn for high levels of fiber and antioxidants."

          "headline":"Add lean meats to your noodle dishes.",

These nontraditional noodles originated in Japan, are gluten-free, and contain fiber and magnesium that aid in controlling your blood sugar and can even improve blood flow. Buckwheat noodles are a good alternative for diabetics. Not all soba noodles are made entirely from buckwheat, so be sure to check the labels to ensure you are purchasing a product made from solely from buckwheat."

Semolina is a coarser type of grain than is used for traditional flour. Semolina can be made from a variety of different ingredients including rice, wheat and corn. Check the labels to be sure they contain whole grains. Whole grain semolina contains fiber which helps with digestion and lowers your risk for heart disease. Fiber also aids your immune system in the development and maintenance of healthy cells."

Use things like avocados, basil, olives, capers, cilantro, mint, lemon, lime, yogurt, peas, bell peppers, pesto, and nuts to create healthy sauces. Use fresh tomatoes instead of canned, when creating a tomato-based marinara sauce. Make creamy, cheese-based sauces with feta cheese, which is lower in fat and calories than most cheeses, Swiss that can come in many forms like low-fat and low-sodium, or cottage cheese that is high in protein and low in fat. You can also use low-fat cream cheese and low-fat sour cream for healthier alternatives."
