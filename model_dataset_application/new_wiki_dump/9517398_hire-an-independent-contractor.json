Government agencies, law firms, and other legal services have free forms available that you can copy and adapt to your needs. A template designed for independent contractors in the same industry will be easier for you to adapt. For example, if you're hiring a freelance writer to produce content for your website, you don't necessarily want to use an agreement template designed for construction contractors. Ideally, you should find an agreement that is designed to be used in the state where you live (or where the work will be performed) and drafted or reviewed by an attorney."

If the independent contractor has an LLC or corporation, use the legal name of the business rather than the contractor's individual name. In contracts, it's common to spell the legal names out once initially and refer to the parties by generic titles throughout the rest of the contract. For example, you might refer to yourself as \"client\" and the independent contractor as \"contractor.\""

The contract should state specifically when the contractual relationship begins and when it will end. Even if you intend the contract to end when the work is completed, you still want a contractual deadline by which the work must be completed. If you intend the relationship to be longer term, check your state's law or consult an employment attorney to find out if there are any limitations in your state regarding the length of contracts."

For example, if you're hiring a contractor to remodel your kitchen, you may make your final payment to the contractor contingent on the work passing inspection. Include the method of payment.

Either you or the contractor can file Form SS-8 at any time. You set out facts about the relationship on the form, then the IRS evaluates those facts and decides whether the person is an independent contractor or employee.
