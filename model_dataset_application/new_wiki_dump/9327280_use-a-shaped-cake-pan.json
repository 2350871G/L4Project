The best way to do this is to fill up a measuring cup with water, add the water into your pan, and stop when you reach \u00be full. The amount of water that you added is the volume of the pan. As a general rule, most shaped pans hold either 10 or 12 cups (2.3 to 2.8L) of batter."

          "description":"Get a paper towel or pastry brush, dip it into a bit of oil or shortening, and rub it all around the inside of the pan. Make sure to get into every dip or gap in the mold or the final cake might stick to the interior. If you want a faster option, you can apply a layer of nonstick spray, such as Baker\u2019s Joy. Some bakers prefer to use butter to coat their pans. However, the water content of butter can make it less effective than pure oils. Nonstick spray can get really slippery on floors, so always spray your pans over the sink."

The best way to do this is to put a spoonful of flour inside and then jiggle the pan around until the flour coats everything. Turn the pan over and dump out any excess."

This will allow the cake to rise without spilling out of the edges of the pan. If you accidently pour too much batter in, just get a spoon and move a bit of it out from the center to an extra bowl. If you end up with extra batter, go ahead and make a few cupcakes in a separate pan."

Prior to baking, look over the pan and consider whether or not any stand-alone sections will stay upright without extra help. If so, go ahead and insert some food grade bamboo skewers or toothpicks into these areas. For example, if you using a 3D animal-shaped cake pan, then it\u2019s a good idea to think about if the head or ears will stay upright post-baking. If you add supports in to the batter, be careful when serving the cake to others. It\u2019s usually a good idea to leave the supported areas uneaten."
