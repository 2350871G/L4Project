Replant them approximately 6 inches apart, preferably in an area in sun or partial shade. You may also purchase heartsease seedlings from local nurseries or gardening stores to plant. Heartsease seedlings can also be planted in decorative planters or pots. You can also start your heartsease indoors in pots and then move them outside once they're around 4 inches (10 cm) tall."

Using gardening sheers or strong scissors, cut away stems of flowers that have already bloomed and grown to their fullest. Cut flowers just above the leaf nodes. Harvesting flowers will achieve the same effect, but deadheading is a wise move if do not intend to harvest all of the heartsease that you grow."
