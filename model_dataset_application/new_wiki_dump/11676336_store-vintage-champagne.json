Many humidifiers and dehumidifiers have sensors that will tell them to turn on and off to keep the humidity levels consistent in your storage area.Tip: Buy or make your own hygrometer so you can monitor the humidity levels to keep them constant."

Use soft white bulbs, or LED bulbs designed for mood lighting, and keep them turned off when you aren\u2019t in the storage room. Keep the area as dark as you can to extend the storage life of your vintage champagne. Soft white bulbs give off a more yellowish light and aren\u2019t as bright as other bulbs. Direct exposure to bright lighting can also damage your vintage champagne."

The champagne inside of the bottles will keep the corks moist and prevent them from shrinking, which can cause the carbonation to leak out. Make sure the bottles don\u2019t roll around while they\u2019re in storage so the carbonation doesn\u2019t build up inside of the bottle.Warning: Storing the vintage champagne standing up will cause the cork to dry out and crack, which will expose the champagne to the outside air and spoil it. It will also cause the cork to crumble when you try to open the bottle."

          "description":"Keep your vintage champagne in storage for several years to age it well and open up subtle flavor notes. Vintage champagnes are higher quality than other types of champagnes or sparkling wines, but they will eventually lose their fizz, so don\u2019t store them longer than 10 years. Old vintage champagne will be flat and taste like dried fruit, so open it up and enjoy it before it goes bad!"
