This means a 500 gallon (1,900 L) tank will need to be refilled about 3 times a year, and a 1,500 gallon (5,700 L) tank about 1 time per year. Families that also want to use propane appliances such as dryers, hot water heaters, and stoves use around 1,500 gallons (5,700 L) each year, so similar tank sizes are suitable."

Underground tanks are typically either 500 gallons (1,900 L) or 1,000 gallons (3,800 L). Always compare the amount of space you have in your yard with the available tank sizes so you know you have enough space to accommodate your propane. 250 gallons (950 L) tanks are 7.5 inches (19 cm) in length and 30 inches (76 cm) in diameter; 320 gallon (1,200 L) tanks are 10 inches (25 cm) in length and 30 inches (76 cm) in diameter; 500 gallon (1,900 L) tanks are 10 inches (25 cm) long and 37 inches (94 cm) in diameter; and 1,000 gallon (3,800 L) gallon tanks are 16 inches (41 cm) long and 41 inches (100 cm) in diameter."

Anything less than $1,000 is going to be 500 gallons (1,900 L) or less.

Professional installation is recommended, although if you have the motivation you can dig your own hole. For a 500 gallon (1,900 L) tank, the typical hole size is around 5 feet (1.5 m) in depth and width with a length of around 12 feet (3.7 m). If you invest in professional installation, be sure to take notes and pictures of the installation and keep them recorded. This information comes in handy when switching tanks or providers. Most regions have certain requirements that determine how and where propane installation can take place. You'll probably have to visit a local fire department for permits. Some regions require an additional plumbing permit, which you can get from local planning departments. All permits are around $25 to $50 and typically don't have to be renewed."
