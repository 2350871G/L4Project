      "description":"When you do, pick one up and drop it on the other; they'll combine and the value will be raised by one. For example, if you drop a \"2\" onto another \"2\", it'll turn into a \"3\". Find all the existing pairs when you start playing the game.

      "headline":"Be strategic about where you move numbers.",
      "description":"If a number has other numbers all around it, it's harder to \"free\" it for moving. Outside of that, you can move numbers in any direction, whether you're pairing them at the time or not. Be strategic about your moves, to bring pairs together and not box important numbers off. Try to pair smaller numbers off quickly, to build your values up higher."

    {
      "headline":"Pile your bigger numbers on top of the smaller ones.",
      "description":"Focus on this once you get to ten, because at that point, the game starts forming bridges. Bridges are when numbers are connected by a bridge and can only be moved as a unit (for example, if you're trying to bring a \"2\" to another \"2\", but it has a bridge with a \"4\", you'll have to move both at once). This strategy will help ensure that your bigger tiles don't join onto a bridge. It will be especially important when you get to fifteen. When you get to fifteen, the bridges will turn into groups of three instead of two."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Don't be afraid to \"reorganize.\"",
      "description":"Move tiles or bridges to another position very far away from where they were if needed. This can help you make combinations and also help you reshuffle your pieces so that you don't get one area that's much taller than the rest. If you realize you can't move a bridge where you wanted to for a pairing, try moving the target piece to the bridge, instead. If needed, move pieces that are in the way, too (even if you move them back afterwards)."

    {
      "headline":"Congratulate yourself for getting to twenty, but work on the tricky part.",
      "description":"The bridges can now turn into groups of four tiles. At this stage, you can keep getting twenty as many times as you want. You basically do the same stuff as you would do if you didn't get to twenty but limit the piling even more. Most likely, you would lose the game if you do that because it is harder to move bigger groups of tiles."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Practice.",
      "description":"The best way to win Twenty is to just play it over and over. Once you start playing it more often, your fingers will be faster and you'll be able to spot pairs more quickly. If you lose, don't worry. You can always keep trying to get to twenty and win the game."
