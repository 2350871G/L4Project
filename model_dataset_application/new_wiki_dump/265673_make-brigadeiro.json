To crank up the sweetness in this recipe, you can either swap the cocoa powder for Nesquick powder all together, or use a portion of Nesquick powder, i.e., two tablespoons (29.57 mL) of cocoa powder and one tablespoon (14.79 mL) of Nesquick powder."

In about 10 to 12 minutes, it should be done. When it seems thick enough, turn off your stovetop. To see if your mixture is thick enough, test it by tilting the pan. It should appear to peel away from the bottom. Another way to test if the mixture is done is by scraping the bottom of the pan with your wooden spoon. If you can reveal the bottom of the pan, it should be thick enough."
