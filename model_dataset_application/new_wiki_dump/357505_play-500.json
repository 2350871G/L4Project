Play your cards until the team who won the bid wins the number of tricks they bid, or it\u2019s not possible for the bid winner to reach their bid. Scoring and Winning the Game Use a score card to calculate the points in each hand. You can find a score card online, such as this one: https://500rules.com/score-card/. The score card tells you how many points are awarded for each different suit and their coinciding bid number. Add or subtract points depending on your bid. If you won the bid and won the number of tricks you bid, then you would use the score card to add that specific number to your score. If you won the bid but didn\u2019t win the right number of tricks, you would subtract the score card\u2019s number from your total score. For example, if your bid was 6 Spades and you won all 6 tricks with Spades, you would add 40 points to your score, according to the score card. If you bid 8 Diamonds and didn\u2019t win all those tricks, you would need to subtract 280 points from your score according to the score card. Keep a piece of paper and pencil next to you to keep track of the scoring, if necessary. Win the game by being the first team to earn 500 points. Continue playing hands and adding up the scores until a team earns 500 points, or a team has negative 500 points or less (meaning they\u2019ve lost). The first team to earn 500 points wins! For each new hand, rotate the dealer to the left.",
