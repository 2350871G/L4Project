          "description":"A bug out bag is an essential piece of luggage that is packed and ready to go at a moment's notice. There are many helpful lists detailing what you should pack in your bag, depending on what type of situation you are preparing for. Things you should consider as all-around essentials include:\nA set of clothes. You want to pack light layers so that you can be dressed appropriately for all weather. Instead of packing a bunch of heavy clothes (sweaters, parkas, etc), try to pack light layers like a tank top, short sleeve, and long-sleeve t-shirt. Food and food preparation. It is suggested to have at least three days of prepared food packed and ready to go in a portable bug out bag. This may include MRE (Meals Ready to Eat) or other non-perishable food items like protein bars, peanut butter, or canned vegetables. You may also want to include simple cooking preparation gear such as a collapsible pot and a utility utensil set. Water. Include a collapsible water canteen, water filter, and at least three days worth of water. This should be about 3 liters (0.8 US gal). Also include a water filter; modern water filters even come in the form of a survival straw. Portable shelter. This could be a simple sleeping bag, a bed roll, or a blanket. A tent may be more effective, but may be too heavy or large for a portable bag. First aid and/or medical kit. Pack medications that you know you will need for a pre-existing medical condition. Pack other essentials like bandages, antiseptics, and gauze."
