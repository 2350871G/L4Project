There is only 1 type of selective herbicide available for nimblewill, called Tenacity, which you can purchase online. To use Tenacity to kill nimblewill, you should:\nSpray the herbicide onto the nimblewill using a commercial pesticide applicator. Follow the instructions on the label to know how much herbicide to use. Apply the herbicide 3 times, waiting 3-4 weeks in-between applications. Do these applications in the summer when your grass is actively growing. If the nimblewill turns white, it means the herbicide is working."

To kill nimblewill with a non-selective herbicide, like Roundup, you should:\nSpray the herbicide onto the nimblewill using a commercial pesticide applicator. Wait until the summer when the nimblewill is actively growing to apply the herbicide. Wait up to 4 weeks for the herbicide to fully kill the nimblewill.

Take a shower and wash your clothes separate from the rest of your laundry after applying herbicide to remove any traces of it. If you accidentally get herbicide on your skin, wash the area immediately with soap and water for 15-20 minutes. If you accidentally get herbicide in your eyes or mouth, call Poison Control."

Tilling 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of compost into the soil so it is more porous. Avoiding over-watering.
