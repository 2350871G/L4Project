If you\u2019re germinating seeds that you plan to transplant outdoors once they\u2019ve matured a bit, it\u2019s better to begin in early spring. Indoor plants are a little more flexible.

Local nurseries and retailers may not carry these potting materials, since they\u2019re specialty items.

While a light misting works if the soil feels dry, they\u2019ll do much better drawing water up from their trays. There should always be a few centimeters (about an inch) of water in the tray. Top watering is when you pour water onto the surface of the soil surrounding the plants using something like a watering can. Carnivorous plants prefer \u201cbottom watering,\u201d which means that you pour water into the tray you keep beneath the pots."

You can then feed your plants by following these steps:\nPut a small amount of dried worms onto a plate you use only for this purpose. Add a few drops of water to the plate to rehydrate the worms. Use a toothpick to spear some wet worms and put them in the plant\u2019s trap. Use tweezers to very gently \u201cseal\u201d the trap once it closes on the worms. Pitcher plants, Sarracenia, Pinguicula (butterwort), and many other carnivorous plants prefer a \u201cdusting\u201d of worms. Grind a few worms into powder then dip a toothpick in water.

For most plants, you can keep using the peat and sand soil mixture. Make sure you put the pots in a spot with full-sun exposure. Use a water tray underneath the plant to make sure the soil stays moist. Venus flytraps need humid conditions. If you live in an extremely hot and dry region, you may need to keep this plant inside.

However, you should go online and look up your plant\u2019s specific growing guide to be sure you\u2019re giving it what it needs! Pitcher plants, for example, need a growing area kept at 70% humidity (or more) with a temperature of 60-68\u2109 (16-20\u2103). Place the pots by a bright windowsill or under fluorescents. Keep about \u00bc inch (0.63 cm) of water in their water tray to make sure the soil stays moist. If you need to use fluorescents, keep a small fan by the plants to ensure they stay cool."

Be sure to look up your particular plant\u2019s growing guide online before you fertilize. Sarracenia in its seedling and juvenile phases (the first year or so of growth) grows well if you add a small amount of pelleted fertilizer high in nitrogen to its soil. Use a slow-release fertilizer at the beginning of the growing season in spring. You only need about 4-6 pellets per small pot. Pitcher plants also appreciate a bit of fertilizer. Once the seedlings are mature, spray a fertilizer with high nitrogen but no urea content onto to the plants. Apply weekly during the spring and summer and monthly in winter."

The plants will begin to wilt and their leaves may turn brown or black. Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re not dying! To provide dormancy, simply:\nPut the plants on an unheated porch. The nighttime temperatures should drop to about 32-55\u2109 (0-13\u2103). Slightly reduce the amount of water you give the plants. While the soil shouldn\u2019t be allowed to dry out, it shouldn\u2019t be wet or even extremely damp. Mexican pinguicula only needs seasonal light cues. If you\u2019re just using sunlight, it\u2019ll get less light naturally. For fluorescents, reduce the amount of light you give them by a few hours per day."
