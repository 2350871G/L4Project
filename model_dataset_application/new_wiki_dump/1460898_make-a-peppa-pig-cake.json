The base cake can be any flavor you want. Chocolate, yellow, and white cakes make good basic cakes that go well with icing. You can bake a cake from scratch or from a box. This is entirely up to you. Make sure to let the cake completely cool before continuing."

There are two ways you can make a stencil:\nIf you have access to a printer, search the internet to find a Peppa Pig coloring template. There are many available that are large pictures of the character on a white background. Make sure the picture you print out is large enough to fit most of the cake. If you can't print out a stencil, take a plain sheet of paper and trace the picture of Peppa Pig from your computer screen. Or, if you can hand draw, draw the outline of Peppa as you look at the image on the computer screen. You can make a cake from any character from Peppa Pig, including George Pig and Mr. Dinosaur."

You will place icing around the edges. Use toothpicks to secure the stencil if it won't stay. You can cut Peppa's ears separately from the extra cake you cut away if you are having trouble cutting around the ears at the top."

If you buy white icing, you will need to get Peppa's skin a light pink and the dress darker pink. You can also make the dress red. Strawberry icing may work really well for Peppa's skin. When using white icing, put a small amount of pink gel food coloring into the icing and mix together. Make sure you have two separate bowls for the two different pinks. For Peppa's skin, you need a light pink color. For her dress, you need a darker pink color. Spread the light pink on the head section of the cake, and then spread the darker pink on the dress.

Cut the excess off, leaving enough so it covers the sides. Then place the dark pink fondant over the dress part. Cut the excess off that edge.
