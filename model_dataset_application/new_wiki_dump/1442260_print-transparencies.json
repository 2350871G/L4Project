Because ink tends to smear on transparencies, it's important that you don't try to print on the transparency without cleaning the printer first. All you need to do is take the cleaning sheet out of its protective sleeve. Run it through the printer using your printer's feed button or the software. You shouldn't try to print anything on it.

If you're not sure how to load your paper so it prints on the rough side, make a mark on a regular sheet of paper and note how you put it in your printer.
