          "description":"The basic rules of \"Who Am I?\" are fairly simple. Each player writes down a name of a thing, based in an agreed-upon category, such as celebrities or historical figures. Once they have written a name, they hand it face down the player next to them. Next, all players place a post it note with a famous person or thing on their head without looking at the answer. Players ask the group questions about their assigned figure in hopes of deducing who or what it might be. This may be done one at a time revolving in a circle.. Finally, the player who guesses his answer correctly first wins the game. Customize the theme and rules to best suit the people you're with. Questions should only be answered by \"Yes\" or \"No\". Anything more complex risks spoiling the game's challenge. Unless you're playing in a competitive context, you should allow everyone a chance to figure out their answer. The \"Who Am I\" game doesn't have any mandatory rules you need to follow. Rather, it is meant to be customized according to the desires of the people playing."

Generally speaking, the more people you get onboard, the more pleasantly chaotic your session will be. The game is meant as an ice breaker for upbeat socialization.

Historical figures, countries and bands are all possible themes you can choose. There are a few well-known versions of this game. For instance, \"Celebrity\" focuses on guessing a popular celebrity. \"Botticelli\" is based exclusively on historical figures, and centers around more educated answers, such as \"Did you paint a picture of Venus rising?\" For example, if you're doing historical figures, a few names you might put on could be: Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Alexander the Great."
