Note that any kind of kale will do - some people prefer lacinato (\"dino kale\") or flat leaf kale due to the tendency of curly green kale to be sold a bit more mature and therefore tougher. It also has a grittier texture and relative lack of flavor. Shred the kale leaves by hand or chop them up into small strips. For tougher, more mature kale, you may want to shred or chop into smaller pieces as this will help the dressing to soften the texture. Put the chopped or shredded kale into the bowl."

          "headline":"Dress the kale to suit your taste.",
          "description":"You might start by adding a few tablespoons so as not to \"over-dress\" the salad. Remember, it's easy to add more dressing, but it's impossible to remove it! Massage the dressing into the kale. The best way to do this is with your hands (or a friend's hands). Note that you should gently squeeze or squish the kale as you mix in the dressing, as this helps break down the cell walls of the leaves and allows the acid in the dressing to soften things up by breaking down cell walls and fibers. Once you have mixed in all the dressing and massaged all the kale in the bowl, taste a bite to see if it has enough dressing for your liking (remember, we'll be adding a few more ingredients too!). If necessary, add more dressing and repeat the massaging and tasting process until you feel the flavors are balanced and delicious."

Adding the Toppings Prepare and add the other salad ingredients to the bowl just before you're ready to serve the salad. This recipe calls for sliced avocado, cucumber, and feta cheese. You can also add any other ingredients that appeal to you. Toss, garnish, and serve the salad. Lightly toss the salad to incorporate all the ingredients. No need to massage anything at this point as doing so will probably turn everything but the kale into mush. You might garnish the salad with additional black pepper, herbs, and/or any other accompaniments you like. Experimenting with Dressing Use a dressing with a lot of acid like lemon juice or vinegar.

Experimenting with Toppings Don\u2019t be afraid to pile the toppings on. Because it is such a robust leaf, kale does well with lots of toppings. Try a salty cheese. Pecorino Romano and shaved Parmesan are popular on kale salads. Aged cheddar also works, or for a salad with more of a Greek feel, try feta. Add nuts or seeds for crunch and flavor. Toasted almonds are delicious along with Parmesan and dates or raisins. Cashew pieces or walnuts can add rich flavor. Sunflower seeds are delicious in summer salads. Fresh and dried fruits pair particularly well with vinaigrettes. Dried cranberries, raisins, cherries, or dates add welcome sweetness. Particularly in summer, also try fresh fruits like blueberries, strawberries, or mango. Add thinly sliced vegetables. Carrots, bell peppers or cucumber are delicious, as are thinly sliced Brussels sprouts. Red onions or sweet white onions will also add a little kick to your salad. Add protein for a more complete meal. You can top your salad with a poached or boiled egg, grilled meat, tofu, or tempeh. Use local or in-season ingredients.
