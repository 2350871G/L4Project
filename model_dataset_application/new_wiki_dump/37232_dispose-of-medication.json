Instead of flushing these medications, the safest way to dispose of them is to disguise them and then throw them away with your trash. Read the packaging on the medication and look for instructions on safe disposal. There are certain medications considered to be too potentially harmful to throw out with the trash. If the medication is a highly controlled substance that could cause severe medical harm to someone else if they were to ingest it, the FDA recommends flushing it or disposing of it in another way.

Consider donating your unused medications to third world countries. There are organizations you can find online. Alternatively, consider contacting your local Emergency Rooms, occasionally they will collect usable supplies and medications for donation out-country. Call your local trash service - they might have household waste facilities that will incinerate the medication. Contact your local hospital or medical center who will place unused medications into their Bio Hazard containers for incineration. All hospitals have this option so there is never a need to toss or flush unused medication."
