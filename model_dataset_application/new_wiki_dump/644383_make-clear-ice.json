  "text":" The Boiled Water Method Use pure water. This method looks to get as much of the air and mineral impurities out of the water as possible before freezing, start with already distilled water. Filtered bottled water will work, or any water purified by reverse osmosis. Boil the water twice. Boiling removes air bubbles from the liquid, allowing the water molecules to stick together even harder in the freezer. After boiling the first time, allow the water to cool. Then boil again. Keep the cooling water covered to prevent any dust from collecting on the surface. Pour water into an ice tray or other mold and cover with a plastic wrap to keep out particles. Make sure that you have let the water cool a bit before pouring it in the tray so that it doesn't melt the plastic. If you really want to impress, try making extra-large clear ice cubes and ice spheres. Nothing like drinking a cocktail on one very large rock. Place the ice tray in the freezer. Leave it for few hours to freeze. Take out the tray and gently remove your clear ice cubes.  The Top-Down Freezing Method Get a small cooler. Just a regular cooler is fine, like the one you use to keep food and drinks cool for a picnic, but it must be small enough to fit in your freezer. The cooler will insulate your ice cubes, forcing them to freeze slowly from the top down. Place your ice tray, mold or other freezing container at the bottom of the cooler. Do not close the cooler. If you can, use trays that make larger ice cubes, or get a series of small, rectangular plastic or silicone containers. Fill your tray or molds with water. Proponents of this method claim tap water works as well as distilled and boiled water. Pour water into the bottom of the cooler, filling in around your ice tray or molds.

Leave it to freeze for 24 hours. The slow freeze should force out any gasses and impurities, leaving you with perfectly clear ice cubes. The bottom freezing method Fill up a bowl with water then dump a lot of salt into it to prevent it from freezing then put it in the freezer. Be careful not to put too little water in the bowl or the freezing will release enough heat to warm up the salt water to 0\u00b0C before the ice cubes finish freezing.
