          "description":"Moss rose seeds can be sown directly into your garden after the final frost in your region. The last frost occurs in spring, often in March or April, although the timing varies depending on your region. Search online for information on your growing zone to figure out when sowing moss rose seeds is safe in your area. If your area doesn\u2019t experience frost, you can sow your seeds around March. You can start seeds indoors about 6 weeks before the last frost occurs if you'd prefer to plant seedlings. Grow the seeds in peat pots in a window that gets good sun or under an indoor growing lamp before transplanting them into your garden."

          "description":"Moss rose plants do not do well in soggy soil. Avoid planting your seeds in clay. Instead, pick a spot in your garden where the soil dries out relatively quickly after getting wet. Find well-draining spots by watching your garden after a hard rain. Any spots that have pools of water a few hours after the rain stops should be avoided. You can amend areas of poor drainage by mixing sand into the soil. Moss roses grow well in rocky areas, including on rock walls and in the cracks along sidewalks."

Check the soil every day and if it appears dry, use a watering can or misting bottle to remoisten the soil. Avoid using a hose, since the heavy spray can wash away seeds and young seedlings. After 10 to 15 days, the moss roses will be established. They will have green sprouts, short roots holding them in the soil, and survive with less water."

You may have a better success rate than this, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to prepare by taking more cuttings than you need. Moss roses can be grown from cuttings every year. After the first time you plant a moss rose, you may not need to buy new plants again."

This should include at least 1 row of leaves or a node, which is a bump on the stem leaves sprout from. A fully-grown moss rose has several stems, so taking these cuttings won\u2019t harm the plant. Remove lower leaves on the cuttings. Any leaves that would be underneath the soil or water in a growing tray will end up rotting. You may be able to take several cuttings from a full-grown plant without harming it."

Move the pot to a sunny spot so your cuttings get plenty of light. Growing cuttings in pots with potting soil is recommended because outdoor soil isn\u2019t sterile. You can also grow the cutting in builder\u2019s sand, perlite, or vermiculite. Peat moss is another possible growing medium. You can also mix peat moss with equal parts builder\u2019s sand and perlite to create your own potting mix."

Cuttings may grow short roots within a few days. After the root sprouts, move the moss rose to a growing tray to encourage the roots to grow further. You may temporarily store your moss rose in water while preparing soil."

Moss roses do not need a lot of water, but moist soil prevents the cuttings from drying out. You will need to do this for about 2 weeks until the cuttings grow roots."

          "headline":"Transplant the cuttings outdoors after they grow roots.",
          "description":"After about 2 weeks, the cuttings will feel hard to move because of the roots holding them to the soil. When this happens, carefully dig around each plant to uncover the root ball. You can then move the cuttings to sunny spots with well-draining soil outdoors. Space the cuttings at least 6 in (15 cm) apart and plant them in holes as deep as the root ball. Before you move the cuttings outside, you should harden them off by placing them outdoors for a few hours each day. Start with 3 hours in a shady spot that's protected by wind. Increase the length of time the cuttings spend outside by a few hours each day for about a week. They should then be ready to be transplanted. You can mix a balanced fertilizer into the soil to help the transplanted cuttings grow. After being transplanted, the cuttings only need to be watered once a week."

Remoisten the soil every 2 or 3 days. If you mist the soil, you may need to apply water daily for up to 4 weeks. After about 2 weeks, the plant should be established.

Pinch off the flowers with your fingers or use shears to cut them off at the stem. Deadheading preserves the rose\u2019s energy so it produces new, healthy blooms. This is because it uses its nutrients to grow new flowers rather than seeds.

Make sure your plant isn\u2019t overwatered, since this can be the cause of fungi and rot. You may want to try a natural, nontoxic pest removal method.
