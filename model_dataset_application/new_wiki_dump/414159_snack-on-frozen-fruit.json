          "description":"All kinds of fruit can be frozen safely, and stored for up to a year. Some fruits taste great frozen, while others you might want to thaw first. It is entirely up to your tastebuds to decide. Bananas. Papaya. Berry fruits, e.g. strawberries, raspberries, blackberries. Kiwi. Oranges. Pineapple. Blueberries. Seedless grapes."

Wrap in plastic (optional), lay flat on a baking tray and place into the freezer. They will take about two hours to freeze, but ideally you should leave them in the freezer overnight. If you have children, insert a popsicle stick before freezing, to help small hands hold them."

Rinse a large bunch of grapes under cool or lukewarm water, and pat dry with a paper towel. They don't need to be completely dry. Place your grapes in a sealed plastic bag, and freeze them overnight. You can also put frozen grapes directly in a glass of white wine instead of an ice cube."

After they are frozen, you can transfer them to a plastic container or Ziploc bag and keep them in the freezer until you want them. Try different flavors of yogurt, like vanilla or chocolate.
