          "headline":"Place a spool of thread on the thread spindle.",
          "description":"Some mini sewing machines have retractable thread spindles (vertical metal or plastic posts on the top-right of the machine). Fully extend the thread spindle by pulling it directly upwards. Then, slide a spool of thread onto the spindle. Some mini sewing machines feature a secondary bobbin spindle on the front of the machine, towards the right side. You can place a bobbin here instead of using a full-sized spool for the top thread. To use this secondary bobbin spindle, remove the cap and slide the bobbin onto the post. Then push the cap back on so the bobbin clicks into place securely. Keep the machine turned off while you thread it to avoid any accidents."

          "headline":"Wind an empty bobbin to fill it up with thread.",
          "description":"Find an empty bobbin that\u2019s compatible with your machine. With the spool of thread positioned on the thread spindle, wrap the loose end of the thread around the central post of the bobbin about 4 or 5 times in a counterclockwise direction. Press the bobbin onto the winding post, which is in the center of the hand wheel on many mini sewing machines. Hold the thread out with your hands, turn on the machine, and press down on the foot pedal. Guide the thread from side to side so it fills up around the entire post of the bobbin. When the bobbin is completely full, cut the thread to separate the bobbin from the spool."

        {
          "headline":"Guide the loose end of the thread through threading mechanisms.",
          "description":"The threading procedure for each sewing machine is slightly different, but you can pinch the end of the thread to guide it along, as directed by your machine\u2019s instructions. Usually, you\u2019ll pass the thread through a series of holes or hooks called thread guides along the way. With most machines, you\u2019ll push the thread through one loop and then pull it firmly between two tension disks. After this, you\u2019ll direct the thread through a hole or hook on the take-up lever, which moves up and down and is located on the left half of the machine, above the needle. Finally you\u2019ll draw the thread down towards the needle, often passing through a hole below the take-up lever and another right above the needle."

          "headline":"Pass the thread through the eye of the needle.",
          "description":"Once the machine is threaded correctly, you\u2019ll direct the end of the thread through the hole (called the eye) in the tip of the machine\u2019s needle. Use the hand wheel to bring the needle to its highest point. Then push the thread through the eye from front to back or left to right, depending on the position of the needle. Refer to the machine\u2019s instructions if you\u2019re not sure which direction to thread the needle. Trim the end of the thread so that it\u2019s smooth and not frayed, and wet it with your tongue to keep the fibers together. Once the needle is threaded, tug about 5 in (13 cm) of thread towards the back. This will prevent it from slipping back through the eye as you begin moving the machine\u2019s mechanisms."

          "description":"Slide off the cover to the bobbin compartment first. Pick up the bobbin and press it into the bobbin-shaped chamber. The bobbin should be sitting horizontally in the compartment, with the thread winding around it in a counterclockwise direction. You\u2019ll usually need to slip the bobbin thread behind a narrow strip of metal or plastic to keep it in alignment, but check the machine\u2019s threading instructions for guidance. The cover is a thin plastic piece that rests on top of the bobbin compartment. Slide it off, either towards the left (if the bobbin compartment is to the left of the needle) or towards you (if the compartment is directly in front of the needle). The bobbin thread should match the color and fiber content of the top spool of thread you\u2019re using."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Turn the hand wheel to lower the needle so it catches the bobbin thread.",
          "description":"Hold the loose ends of the bobbin thread and the spool of thread together in your left hand. Use your right hand to turn the hand wheel (on the right side of the machine) towards you. This will move the needle down and the top thread will catch the bobbin thread. Pull the loose ends of thread until there\u2019s about 5 in (13 cm) of each strand extending past the needle before you turn the hand wheel. If your machine has a thread channel next to the bobbin compartment, you can slip both threads into this channel to line them up while you turn the hand wheel. Make sure you\u2019re still holding the loose ends firmly."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pull the loop of bobbin thread out above the feed dogs.",
          "description":"Keep turning the hand wheel to bring the needle back up. It will pull a loop of bobbin thread up through the gap between the feed dogs (metal bars featuring a toothy texture). Tug on this loop out so that the loose end of the bobbin thread comes out of the bobbin compartment. You can gently pull the top thread upwards to expose the loop so it\u2019s easier to grab onto. Pull the loose ends of both threads towards the back of the machine, passing them under the presser foot. Now you have a correctly-threaded machine! Slide the bobbin compartment cover back into place when you\u2019re done."

Use your hands to gently guide the fabric, but keep them well away from the needle for safety. You can press the backstitch button or lever (usually located on the front of the machine) to make a few stitches in the opposite direction.
