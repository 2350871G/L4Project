You'll only ever find ammo for the weapons you have in your attache case from random drops and boxes. If you don't have the Rifle? You won't get Rifle drops. If you don't have a mine thrower? Ditto. In general, you should stick to maybe three weapon types- plus a magnum for sticky situations and bosses.

If you stop short when they wind up and back off, they'll miss and you'll have an opening to run in and slash their face- which will have the same stunning effect that shooting them in the head would, leaving them open for a melee attack."

          "description":"In general (with a few rare exceptions towards the end of the game) you don't want to shoot at the body of a Ganado. Instead, aim for the face or knees. Shooting these targets will allow you to perform a melee attack that will knock an enemy down and send them flying. However, past the castle section, it's worth it more to shoot them in the knees. If you manage to send a Zealot or Militia Ganado to their knees, then you can perform a devastating suplex. It has a very high chance to decapitate your foe, and will never generate a Plaga. You're also completely invincible while performing melee attacks, so no need to fear. If you play your cards right, and use this strategy in conjunction with your knife-work, you can use as little as one handgun bullet to take out normal enemies."

Before you sell them, however, make sure to check the description. If it says anything like \"This looks like it was once set in something\" or \"It looks like something was set here,\" then keep it and try to find what can be attached to it.

          "description":"This is somewhat a matter of personal opinion, but you're better off skipping these weapons and holding out for the betters to save on Pesetas. Red9 - The first offender. The power it packs is an incredible draw- and when fully upgraded, it packs 5.0 power, the equivalent of five standard handgun shots. However, while the punch it packs is nice, it's outperformed in all other areas by the other handguns in terms of reload speed, capacity, and firing speed. Not to mention the gun is so hard to aim reliably that you pretty much have to buy the stock if you want to do reliable damage. Also, the you have the option to purchase the Blacktail the minute you get into the castle, and it's fully upgraded power is still a respectable 3.4. TMP - The Machine Pistol is certainly a good weapon for crowds, admittedly. However, if you're dealing with a crowd of Ganados, you'll rarely find yourself in a situation that the Shotgun won't perform equally well in. Plus, in the Castle segment, the Blacktail is available for purchase, which hits harder per bullet, has more common ammo drops, and is far more precise than the TMP, which really needs the stock to be accurate. Killer7 - This is a powerful gun. 25 base power compared to the Broken Butterfly's 13. However, you're very rarely going to find yourself in a situation that needs that base power- in fact, you should rarely, if ever use the magnum. The fact that you find the Broken Butterfly for free in the castle is a far better deal than the 77,700 Pesetas you'd spend on it. It's a boss killer weapon, but so is the Rocket launcher- and you could buy two of those for that price. Mine Thrower - This is an incredibly dangerous weapon that takes up too much space in the inventory and has a tendency to blow up in your face without the additional scope. Literally."

Do not try to get it until the normal enemies head to the church in the opening chapter. Otherwise it will trigger a massive enemy rush. Punisher - Through the Village, you'll find blue medallions hanging around. Shoot ten of them and talk to the merchant to get the Punisher handgun for free. Shoot all fifteen, and he'll throw in a free firepower upgrade. Broken Butterfly - In the castle, if you give Ashley a boost in a certain segment, she can unlock the door to a free Broken Butterfly Magnum."

Here's how:\nOnce you enter, you'll see a barn on your right. Go to the house to the immediate left and kick the door open. Now run to the right and push the chest of drawers halfway in front of the door. Now, go in front of the door and shoot a hole in the door around the knob. This will open up a hole.

To start, push two bookshelves in front of the boarded up windows. Just two, not all three. Then destroy the boards of the one you left uncovered. This gives you a chokepoint that you can easily control. After they all start swarming in through all the openings, the Ganados are all in the small space with you. Try shooting the Ganados in the head and try to kick a lot of them at a time. When Luis urges you to go upstairs, this is where the Punisher really shines. Stay at the top of the stairs, and aim down them. The enemies will try to use ladders to get up to you, but Luis will always knock them down, forcing the enemies to use the stairs. As the Punisher blasts through two enemies at once for the same damage, it will make a troubling segment that much easier."
