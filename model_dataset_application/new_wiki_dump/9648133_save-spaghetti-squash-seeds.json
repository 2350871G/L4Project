  "text":" Harvesting the Seeds Get a ripe spaghetti squash. For the best seeds possible, pick a spaghetti squash that is firm and fairly heavy. When fully ripe, the squash should have a rich, yellow color; if it's green, it's not ready. If possible, avoid harvesting seeds from squash that are cracked or soft, since they may have been exposed to bacteria. Cut open the squash. Open up the squash using a sharp, clean kitchen knife.
