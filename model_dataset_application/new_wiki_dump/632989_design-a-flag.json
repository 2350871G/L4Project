For example, Nepal\u2019s flag is made of two overlapping triangles. Consider what you will be using your flag for. A triangle will work well for a pennant flat, while a rectangle will work for a sports flag. In general, rectangles are the easiest shape to work with because they give you the most space to create your design on."

The flag can also be a solid color with a unique symbol in the center. Alternatively, you can place a rectangle in the upper left hand corner called a canton (like on the American flag) that includes a symbol. You could create a symmetrical flag, like Japan's flag, or an asymmetrical flag, like Norway's flag. Look at flags for other countries and sports teams to get ideas. If you really want a detailed flag, take a look at some of the state and community flags."

The most common colors found on flags are black, blue, green, red, white, and yellow. You can use light and dark colors to create contrast. You do not need to stick to the most popular colors. Instead, choose a color that symbolizes the place or organization your flag represents. Avoid colors that are too similar to each other, such as red and orange or navy and dark purple. They won't stand out as well."

For instance, you may be designing a flag for a micronation, fictional land, club, organization, or charity. Keep this in mind when you are adding symbolism to your flag. For example, if you are creating a flag for a fishing club, you may want to use a fishing rod, boat, or fish as a symbol. The color blue could also be used to represent water."

For example, if your location is near water, you may want to include blue in your flag to symbolize the water. Consider some of the meanings associated with popular flag colors:\nBlack: determination, ethnic heritage, bravery, and/or defeating one's enemies. Blue: freedom, vigilance, perseverance, loyalty, justice, prosperity, peace, patriotism, water. Green: the Earth, agriculture, luck, and/or fertility. Red: courage, communism, revolution, hardiness, blood, and/or valor. White: peace, purity, snow, and/or innocence. Yellow: the sun, wealth, and/or justice. Pink: feminism. Gray: selflessness."

The image of an eagle could symbolize freedom or power, a star could stand for divinity or honor, and a circle could represent the sun. The Japanese flag, for instance, has a plain white background with a red circle in the middle. This represents the sun, which is an important symbol in Japanese culture. Create your own meaningful symbol. For example, holding hands can symbolize friendship or teamwork."

Lettering is also difficult to read from a distance and will look backwards if viewed from the opposite side. Flags are often hung up high and can flap in the breeze. As a result, lettering of any kind will be difficult to read. If you must include lettering, make it visible. For example, California's state flag has the words \"California Republic\" written in bold, brown letters on a white background."

Flag designs should be simple enough for a child to draw from memory. You can still have a more detailed image on your flag, like the grizzly bear on California's state flag. The overall shape should be simple, however. A great way to create easy designs is to use stencils, cookie cutters, or clip art."
