          "description":"The less you have in the center of the room, the more spacious it will feel. Put your bed to 1 side, against or near the wall, rather than smack dab in the middle. If you prefer the look or functionality of having both sides of the bed open, try to minimize how much space you leave on 1 side. For example, instead of centering your bed with equal space on both sides, place your bed on the right side of the room, leaving just 1 to 2 ft (0.30 to 0.61 m) between the bed and the wall. Now you have the look you like without sucking up space. If you put your bed up against the wall, pile on plush pillows so that it can serve as a seating area during the day. If your bed is facing the doorway, make sure there\u2019s at least 3 feet (0.91 m) between the foot of the bed and the door. This gives you enough space to open the door without hitting the bed."

          "description":"Make your furniture pull double duty by selecting items that have multiple uses. For example, place a stool under a tall nightstand so it can be a desk, too. This helps limit the amount of furniture in your room and saves space. Make your shelves multipurpose by adding hooks underneath them so you can hang coats or bags, too, for instance. Another option is to use a dresser to store things other than clothes. For example, if you don't have room for a desk, keep your supplies and notebooks in the smaller top drawers of a dresser. Other Ideas for 2-in-1 Furniture Pieces\nOpt for a daybed if you want a place to sleep that also becomes a couch. Use an ottoman as a spare seat and a storage spot. Turn a dresser into a vanity by arranging your cosmetics on top of it."

          "description":"For rooms that aren\u2019t your standard square or rectangle, have your larger pieces of furniture customized to fit the specific dimensions. For instance, if you have an A-frame room, order a dresser that is the exact height of the lowest point of the ceiling, so it sits snugly in the space. If your room has a small alcove, for example, get a desk or nightstand custom-sized to fit the width of the area so you're using every available inch. Search for retailers online that specialize in custom furniture or contact furniture stores in your area to see if they offer that option. Be aware that custom furniture will be more expensive than a generic piece."

For instance, place a small trashcan underneath your desk where your chair sits or tucked in the corner of the room next to your nightstand where it's not easily visible. You can keep your laundry basket in your closet or in a tall wardrobe with closed doors where the basket is hidden."

Don\u2019t just shove loose pieces underneath your bed, either. Instead, buy long, low plastic bins or boxes specifically designed for under-bed storage to organize your items. You can also look for a bed frame that has drawers built into the base rather than sliding bins underneath. Put your bed on risers if you want to create more space for storage under it. You can buy risers from a furniture store or online retailer."

          "description":"If your closet is messy or overflowing, you won\u2019t be able to get the most storage space out of it. Start by decluttering your closet by getting rid of or donating things you no longer want. Then, hang delicate clothes, like blouses or dresses, and install shelves or buy a shelving unit for heavier folded pieces, like pants or sweaters. Use a shoe rack if you want to keep your footwear off the floor, too. To add more space for hanging clothes, place a 2nd rod underneath the existing one in your closet. For lightweight clothing, you can even use a tension rod, which doesn\u2019t require any tools to install. If you have a very small bedroom, you can also put your dresser in your closet. Not only will it open up your bedroom area, it makes practical sense to keep your clothes in one spot, too. If you don\u2019t have a closet, look for a tall wardrobe that will keep your clothes and shoes out of sight. Or, if you want to show off your pieces for a contemporary vibe, mount a rack on the wall or in the corner of the room to hang your clothes.

If you use wall lamps, place them somewhere practical, like by your bed, for example, to use as reading light. If you opt for a chandelier or other type of hanging light fixture, install it so that it hangs no lower than 7 feet (84 in) above the floor. If it\u2019s any longer, tall people may have to duck.
