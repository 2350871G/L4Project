  "text":" Baking the Cookies Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 Fahrenheit (175\u00b0 Celsius).  Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper.  Combine the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves together. Set aside for later use. Whisk the wet ingredients together in a separate bowl. Beat the eggs, oil, puree, and vanilla extract until properly whisked. The mixture should be creamy and resemble an orange color. Add the brown sugar and dry ingredients. Fold in the ingredients with a rubber spatula. Mix until the cookie batter forms and you can no longer see flour streaks. Scoop the cookie dough onto the two baking sheets. Place them two inches apart from another to prevent them connecting while baking. To make scooping easier, you can spray non-stick cooking spray or oil on the inside of the ice cream scoop or spoon. Bake the cookies in the oven for about 15 minutes. To test if the cookies are done, poke a toothpick in the middle of one the cookies. They will usually be ready when the tops start to gently crack. Allow the cookies to cool for about 10 minutes.  Making the Filling and Serving Sift the powdered sugar in a large bowl until it's light and fluffy.  In a separate bowl, cream the butter for about 2-3 minutes. Mix well on medium speed until the butter is smooth. Fold in the cream cheese and blend once more.  Combine the powdered sugar and vanilla extract together. Blend again for about 2-3 minutes until the filling is smooth and has no powdered sugar streaks. The cream cheese filling can last a day or two if covered and stored properly in the fridge. Scoop all the filling into a pastry bag.  Create the whoopie pies. Add a dollop of filling to a pumpkin cookie. Press down on it gently with another cookie to create a whoopie pie. Repeat until there are no more cookies. Allow the pumpkin whoopie pies to chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.  Serve. Place the whoopie pies onto a serving plate and serve with a glass of milk. Enjoy!",
