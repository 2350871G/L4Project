  "text":" Sterilizing Bottles and Jars Pick out appropriate glass jars and bottles. Look for jars or bottles designed for canning purposes. They should be made of tempered glass and free of nicks and cracks. Be sure they each have appropriate tight-fitting lids. Jars should have flat, gasket-lined lids with screw bands. Screw bands can be reused, but you'll need new flat lids. Bottles should have rubber seals that are in good condition. Wash the jars and bottles. Use hot water and dish soap to thoroughly wash the jars and bottles you plan to sterilize. Make sure they are completely free of dried pieces of food and other debris. Wash the lids as well.
