Fixing Wooden Chairs Inspect the wooden chair for loose legs, screw, or nails. Check how loose the chair legs are, as well as the back of the chair, by pushing and pulling them back and forth to see how much movement they have. There should be virtually no movement. Position the chair you are working on upside down. You can either flip the chair upside down on a table or on another chair so that you can more easily access the problem area. This will also prevent any unwanted pressure on the legs or back of the chair when you are working. Apply glue to loose joints.
