      "description":"Although the benefit of this is not as great on newer Windows systems as it was in the days of Windows 98 or XP, you can still speed up the operation of your computer in most tasks by defragmenting the hard drive. Go to Start/Run and type 'defrag.exe' (minus the quotation marks) or if you can't get that to work do a search for 'Defrag' and click on the disk defragmenter tool. Follow the on screen instructions."

Visit either the ATI or nVidia website listed in the sources below to find the latest drivers for your card."
