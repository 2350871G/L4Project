Settling Kangkong in Water Choose a large pot or basin for your kangkong. Kangkong can grow in a pot of water. You can choose as large a pot as you want. However, keep in mind that you need to be able to reach to the middle of the pot to harvest your plants, so keep it under 4\u20135 feet (1.2\u20131.5 m).
