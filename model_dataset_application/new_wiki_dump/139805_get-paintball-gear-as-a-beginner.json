          "description":"Commercially available paintball masks must undergo a rigorous testing process before going out to market. Most masks provide adequate protection, so find one that fits your head best. Masks come in three profiles: Small, medium, and large. The profile is how far the mask lens extends out so you can see to the sides. Small profile masks are best for indoor matches since you only need to see in front of you for most of the game. Medium and large profile masks are best for outdoor games with wide playing fields. Regardless of what type of paintball you play, your mask should fully shield the front and sides of your head. The back of your head will be mostly covered by a thick strap."
