The Gambler's General Store in Las Vegas is a good source with a lot of variety or you can order most chips over the internet from various stores including Amazon.com. Also, a lot of local high-end game stores will carry clay chips. Expect to pay $.50 - $1.50 a chip, more for a case to carry them, and realize that not all chips are the same."
