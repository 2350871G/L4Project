          "description":"Go into your camera\u2019s menu and look for the file format you\u2019re shooting in. Select the \u201cRAW\u201d option, which takes the picture without any quality degradation. When you take photos in RAW format, they may look flat at first, but you will be able to accentuate different tones and colors when you load them into editing software. You can usually only open RAW photos in editing software, but you will be able to make adjustments to color before exporting them to a different file format. If you have a large memory card, you may set your camera to shoot in RAW and JPEG format so you can share the photos immediately if you want. Most phones don\u2019t shoot in RAW format."

          "headline":"Try the HDR camera mode if you\u2019re shooting from your phone.",
          "description":"The high-dynamic range (HDR) setting takes multiple photos and combines them to get the truest colors and most details from your image. Open the camera app on your phone and look for the HDR switch near the top or bottom of your screen. Make sure it\u2019s turned on before you start taking your photos, or else you won\u2019t notice a difference in the images. Many phones save an HDR and a non-HDR version of your photos so you can see the difference right away. HDR photos will look blurry if you move or shift your phone while taking the picture."

          "headline":"Set the lowest f-stop setting to increase the aperture size.",
          "description":"Open your camera\u2019s menu and look for the section labeled \u201cf-stop\u201d or \u201caperture.\u201d Look for the lowest number listed on the menu and select it with the OK button on your camera. Usually, the lowest setting will be somewhere between f/1.8\u2013f/3.5, but it will depend on the size of the lens you\u2019re using. The f-stop adjusts how much light goes through your camera lens, which will make your photos look brighter. Reducing the f-stop will make things that further away look blurry. Take a few test pictures first so you know where the camera starts to lose focus."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use shutter speed matching the lens size to prevent blurry photos.",
          "description":"Look at the lens you\u2019re using and check the focal length listed in millimeters. Open the camera settings and locate the section that lists a fraction or is labeled \u201cShutter speed.\u201d Look for the fraction that has a denominator that\u2019s about the same as the lens\u2019s focal length. For example, if you\u2019re using a 30 mm focal length, use the 1/30 shutter speed to take your photos. The shutter speed controls how fast the camera takes the picture and is listed as fractions of a second. If you set the shutter speed any faster, the image may look too dark. If you have a tripod and you\u2019re shooting stationary subject matter, you can use the longest shutter speed to let the most light into the sensor. However, if your subject is moving, they will look blurry with a longer shutter speed."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Adjust the white balance settings to get natural-looking colors.",
          "description":"Look for the white balance setting in the camera menu, which is usually listed as a number followed by the letter K. If you\u2019re shooting outside in a shaded area, try to keep the white balance between 6,400\u20138,000 K. For indoor or night shoots, opt for a setting between 2,500\u20135,000 K instead. Take a few test pictures to see if colors look natural and continue making adjustments as you need. White balance makes colors look more realistic based on the light temperature of the area you\u2019re shooting. Use a light meter to find the correct color temperature of where you\u2019re shooting if you don\u2019t want to experiment with multiple settings. If you\u2019re shooting in RAW format, you can also adjust the white balance in editing software so you don\u2019t have to worry about it before you take pictures."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Increase your ISO setting to get more exposure.",
          "description":"Look for the menu labeled \u201cISO\u201d in the camera menu and click on it to access the options. Try turning the ISO up by 1 setting at a time before taking a test image to see how it affects the picture quality. Use the lowest ISO setting that allows you to see your subject matter without the image looking too grainy. The ISO digitally brightens your image when you take the picture, but it may make the picture look grainy if you use too high of a setting. Avoid using a setting higher than 1,600 since your photos will have a lot of digital noise that you won\u2019t be able to get rid of while you\u2019re editing.Tip: If the picture has digital noise after increasing the ISO, try converting the image to black and white. This can help make the noise look like a natural film grain as well as dampen harsh colors or lights."

          "description":"A prime lens has a wider aperture that allows more light to go through the lens, so your images will appear brighter. Opt for a lens that has an aperture of f/1.4 or f/1.8 so it captures the most light. Make sure the lens you buy fits the brand and model for your camera since some lenses may not be compatible. Secure the lens to your camera and use it when you take low light photographs. You can buy prime lenses online or from specialty photography stores."

          "description":"Screw the camera onto the tripod shoe, which is a small rectangular piece that attaches to the top of the tripod. Place the tripod on a flat, sturdy surface so it doesn\u2019t tip over when you\u2019re ready to set up your shot. After putting the camera on a tripod, you can set a longer shutter speed longer to allow more light to enter the lens. Moving objects will look blurry when you shoot them with a long shutter speed. If you want something more portable, look for a monopod that only has 1 leg. You will have to hold the monopod steady while you\u2019re using it."

          "description":"Get stand or clip lights that you can position near your subject to help illuminate them better so you don\u2019t have to make as many adjustments to your camera. Set the lights at a 45-degree angle to your subject so the light doesn\u2019t look as harsh, and try varying their distance from the subject to see how it changes. If you want to make the subject brighter, place the lights closer to your subject. For a darker composition, set the lights further away. You can use regular lamps if you aren\u2019t able to afford photography lights. Try positioning lights behind or to the side of your subject to make them look more dramatic."

Don\u2019t touch the shutter button on top of the camera, but instead click the remote shutter to take the picture. That way, you don\u2019t accidentally bump or shift the camera and make the photo blurry. You can buy remote shutters online or from photography stores. Remote shutters work best if you\u2019re using a tripod. If you don\u2019t have a remote shutter, you can also use the built-in timer on the camera so you don\u2019t have to press the button.Variation: If you\u2019re shooting pictures on your phone, press the volume buttons to take the picture rather than tapping the screen so you don\u2019t shake it as much."

Look for the flash setting on your camera, which is usually marked with an arrow shaped like a lightning bolt. Hold the shutter button down completely when you take the picture so the flash goes off as your camera captures the image. Camera flash can cause red-eye or overexpose details, making them more difficult to see. If your camera flash makes the light too harsh, try holding a diffuser or a piece of tissue paper in front of it to make the light look softer. Make sure camera flash is allowed wherever you\u2019re shooting before using it."

If you want to make your photo look more moody, keep the lights behind or to the side of your subject to add accents. If you want to see the subject clearly, keep the light behind the camera so it illuminates them easily. That way, you won\u2019t have to adjust many settings to make the picture visible.

Once you have everything in focus, turn off the flashlight before taking the picture. You don\u2019t need to use a flashlight if your camera already focuses on your subject.Tip: If you don\u2019t have a flashlight, try holding the shutter button halfway down, which may turn on a small light in your camera that can be used to autofocus and detect faces."
