Usually, the first step of action grading and preparing soils for a building project involves clearing and grubbing. This means removing trees and vegetation, then grubbing out roots, organic materials, large rocks, and other impediments."

      "description":"Some sites can be balanced, by scraping away topsoil and debris, then using existing subgrade material to level the site. Depending on your soil geology, you may have layers of sand, clay, gravel, or other soils/materials that can be stockpiled during clearing and placed back in a later step."

      "description":"Most often, unusable materials like limbs, roots, and other things should be removed or disposed of as soon as they are cleared. In some locations, burning is an economical option, but if it isn't practical or permitted in your area, go ahead and get rid of them so they don't become a breeding ground for pests."
