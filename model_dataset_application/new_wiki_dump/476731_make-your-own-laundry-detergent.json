Soap nuts, which are also called soap berries, are the fruit from the Sapindus shrub, a plant in the lychee family that\u2019s native to parts of India and Nepal. Soapnut shells naturally contain saponin, which is a surfactant, making these berries an ideal biodegradable alternative to commercial laundry detergent. Soap nuts can be purchased in health food stores, alternative grocers, and online."

          "description":"When the water comes to a boil, turn the heat to medium-low and continue simmering for half an hour. This will give the soap nuts time to release their saponins into the water. Watch the mixture carefully as it boils, as soap nut water is prone to boiling over in a sudsy mess."

          "headline":"Remove the lid and boil for another 30 minutes.",
          "description":"When the mixture has boiled for 30 minutes, remove the lid and keep simmering for another half hour. As the soap nuts boil, mash the shells gently with the back of a fork a few times to help them release more saponins. As the mixture boils with the lid off, the water will reduce and create a more concentrated detergent."

Set the liquid aside to cool to room temperature, about an hour. Leave the soap nuts in the strainer to cool as well. This quantity of water and soap nuts will yield about 3\u00be cups (881 ml) of detergent."

Remove the funnel and screw the lid onto the container. It\u2019s best to use a container with an airtight lid, as this will help preserve the detergent longer."

The mixture will last for up to two weeks as long as you keep it chilled. For even longer lasting detergent, fill a clean ice cube tray with the soap nut liquid.
