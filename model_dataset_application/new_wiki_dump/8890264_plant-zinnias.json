Usually, you insert the test in the soil for a set period of time, sort of like using a thermometer, and then check the test to see the pH."

Adding organic materials to your soil, which you can purchase online or at a greenhouse, can alter your soil's pH. Limestone is your best option to raise pH levels. Limestone should be added to the top seven inches of your soil. To lower pH levels, opt for acidic materials such as pine needles and peat moss. If you need to lower your soil's pH fast, opt for sulfur. If you don't want to alter your soil's pH, plant your zinnias in a pot or raised gardening bed with potting soil that has the right pH level."
