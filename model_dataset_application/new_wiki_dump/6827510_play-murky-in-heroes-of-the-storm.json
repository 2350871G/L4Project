          "description":"In the early game, Murky is more of a nuisance than anything else. For the first few levels, Murky doesn\u2019t have much more health than a creep, so any single hero in the game can kill him in a couple of hits. This is why it\u2019s important to stay out of team fights at the start, because you won\u2019t be able to do much more than throw a Pufferfish and run away. It\u2019s best to stay to your lane and keep pushing because you\u2019ll pressure the enemy team into leaving a hero to defend instead of joining the fight."

          "headline":"Learn your skills.",
          "description":"It\u2019s extremely important to know exactly when to use each skill, and how to combine them properly. Since you shouldn\u2019t join team fights before level 10, you should stay on a lane and push while everyone else is fighting. Your trait allows you to set an egg that allows you respawn after you die, so it\u2019s important to place it as close to the action as possible. Try to place it in hidden places, or behind your gate and towers, since it can be killed fairly easily. Your Pufferfish skill is excellent for pushing, and if you aim it properly you can clear an entire creep wave or damage a tower plus the gate. Your Slime is a skill that does low damage at first, but increases if you apply it to an already slimed target. It\u2019s spammable, so be sure to use it on creeps at all times. Your Safety Bubble makes you invincible for a short period of time, so use it to escape."

          "headline":"Choose the right talents.",
          "description":"Murky relies on his talents and skill more than any other hero in the game. His auto-attack damage is so low that most heroes won\u2019t even feel an attack, so it\u2019s important to select the right talents if you want to be able to contribute to team fights after level 10. His talents also help a lot with pushing, since they provide ability power that turns your Pufferfish into an excellent minion wave clear tool. Here\u2019s what talents you should choose to go from a nuisance to a possibly dangerous hero:\nBlock at level 1 \u2013 50% damage blocked from hero basic attacks may not seem like a lot, but it adds up as the game progresses. Adds a lot of survivability! Living The Dream at level 4 \u2013 This is a talent that relies on you staying alive. If you can do that, the extra 15% ability power provided provides a lot of extra damage for pushing and harassing on lane. Slime Advantage at level 7 \u2013 Apply a slime and then auto-attack an enemy hero to see the effect. 100% extra auto-attack damage to slimed targets means you finally pack a punch!"

Hide your egg in bushes or in hidden areas to avoid discovery as much as possible. During team fights, enemy heroes won\u2019t have time to start looking for your egg, so you\u2019ll be able to die and re-appear numerous times, providing a real benefit for your team.

Continuous Slime at level 14 \u2013 Since most of your damage comes from your Slime skill, it\u2019s only natural that you lower its cooldown with this talent. Slimy Pufferfish at level 16 \u2013 This is basically an extra slime, right where you throw your Pufferfish. An excellent combo that goes even better with your ultimate.<rev> http://www.heroesfire.com/hots/guide/murky-the-assassin-1203</ref>\nThese will truly turn you into a hero that is feared in the late game. Always be sure you have your Pufferfish off cool-down, and throw right under the hero you want to catch with your ultimate. This will not only stun him for 3 seconds, giving your team enough time to kill him, but it will also do a lot of damage once the Pufferfish explodes. This combo is enough to kill most fragile heroes such as Valla and Nova in one hit, if you\u2019ve harassed them a little with your Slime before that."
