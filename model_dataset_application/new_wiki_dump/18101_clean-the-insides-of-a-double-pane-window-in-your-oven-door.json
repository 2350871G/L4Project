Putting Your Oven Door Back Together Slide the doors back together. Gently move the two sides of the door back into place. Make sure not to let go of either side.

Once the doors are back together, press them tightly together so that you can screw the inner side back into place. Replace the screws. Put each screw back into place one by one.
