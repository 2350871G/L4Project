          "description":"There are multiple benefits to going to a party with someone rather than on your own. It will give you the added confidence when you first walk in because you will know someone else is just getting there too. Plus, as you start up conversations and meet new people, you will have an extra voice to keep things going. Make plans ahead of time regarding whether you will stay together the whole time or if you plan to split off. Having a friend can be a great way to get started at the party, but you may not want to be stuck together the whole time. Plus you will avoid hurting each other\u2019s feelings if you decide ahead of time that it\u2019s okay to separate while you are there. You will also want to make sure of the plan on when you will leave and if you\u2019ll go together or not. Keep in contact so you know if the other person is ready to go."

          "description":"If the party is more than a small group of close friends, you will likely find a wide range of people from different grades and social cliques. When you first get to the party, take a few minutes to really scan the room and see who is around. Finding someone you know can be a good place to start, rather than being stuck somewhere alone. Catch the eyes of a couple of different people when you first arrive. Smile and wave at them. Give them a gesture that says, \u201cI\u2019ll come talk to you soon.\u201d Establishing a couple different people you want to talk to can make it easier than waiting around for people to come to you. Parties are also a great place to meet some new people or make connections with people you rarely see or talk to. Think of the person you have multiple classes with but you never get much of a chance to spend time with. Parties are the perfect place to have a first conversation that can lead to friendship down the road. It is also always good to find the host quickly, since they are most likely the reason you are there. Tell them thanks for the invite or mention what a great party it is. You can also ask them if they need help with anything."

You can learn a lot from their actions and begin to apply those in your own way. It can also be helpful to start up a conversation with them or get involved in what they are doing. They can help you meet more people and get into the center of the party. If you don\u2019t have much party experience, you can be honest with this person and ask them to help you get the most out of it. Ask them if they can introduce you to some people or maybe show you around the party. It\u2019s okay to let people know you are new to the party scene. Once this person has shown you around a little and you get more comfortable, you can then use what they have given you and start to become the person who helps others get used to it.

Trying to pay attention to everything means paying attention to nothing. Actively fight this tendency. Be in the moment you are in, and find a way to shut out all the other people besides the ones you are specifically with. If you go through the whole party trying to focus on everything that is going on, you won\u2019t actually experience any of it directly. Allow yourself to forget about all the extra stuff that\u2019s around you and enjoy the thing you are currently doing. Once you find someone and are hanging out with them, don\u2019t look around the rest of the room to see what everyone else is doing. Pay attention to only what you are doing, at least for a while."

You can watch your phone sitting at home alone, but you don\u2019t always get to be out with people doing stuff. Rather than thinking of all the other stuff you could be doing, enjoy the party you are at.

Making sure that you move throughout the various spaces of the party will increase the number of people that see you there. This gives you the opportunity to interact with as many people as possible rather than just those in one spot. If you have been in one place for a while, mention that you are going to check out another room or go outside. You can specifically mention someone that you want to go talk to, or you can say you are going for food or a drink. The people who you are talking with will be less likely to think you are just ditching them. They may even think that you are more important because you have other people you plan to see. It may feel more comfortable to stick with the location and group of people that you already secured, but being the life of the party means being seen by more people. Later on, the guests will most likely not remember the person who sat on the couch the whole time, but they will remember someone who they saw moving throughout the entire party the whole night."

You have to take stock of which one you are at, but starting something fun can be adapted to either one. You could lead in getting people dancing, get people to jump in the pool, start a game of truth or dare, or form an arm wrestling competition. People want to have fun at parties, and while that may involve just drinking and hanging out, a lot of people also want something active to do. If you start up a fun trend that everyone ends up getting really into, you\u2019ll be looked at as someone who is fun to have around.
