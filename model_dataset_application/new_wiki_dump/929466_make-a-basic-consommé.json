You can substitute in any kind of vegetables you like, except for starchy vegetables (like potatoes) that will make the stock cloudy. Blending the meat and vegetables together will make for a more flavorful stock, but it will also make the stock easier to clarify. Use the same kind of meat and stock to make the consomm\u00e9.
