          "description":"Before actively adding romantic decoration, you need to take away things that detract from the romance of the room. The best way to do this is to clean up the room and remove things that get in the way of romance. Stand in the room and look around at what is present. Let your eye linger on things that seem overly business-like or seem to represent work and responsibility. And consider moving those things to another room of the house. Remove things that are work related, such as a computer or printer, or are household chores, such as piles of clean or dirty laundry. These types of things will remind you of responsibilities and will take away from the romance of the room. Keep work out of the bedroom and get in the practice of finishing chores that must be done there rather than leaving them sit. Get rid of excess stuff in your room. You most likely have things in your room that you don't need anyway, so for the sake of romance, actively search the room and get rid of anything that you don't use or need. Look for piles of papers, receipts, and bills and put them in a box. Fill a trash bag with anything you don't mind parting with and donate it to a charity. Remove extra books, clothing, shoes, and anything that doesn't have a place, like random charging cables, tools, workout equipment, luggage, knickknacks, and junk."

          "headline":"Make the bed.",
          "description":"This may not seem romantic when you first think about it, but consider it a moment more. A nicely made bed looks fresh and inviting. It looks like it is calling you to lay down and pose in a romantic way. A messy bed looks like someone else has already been laying down or rolling around in it. If you want to maintain the romance day to day, get in the habit of always making the bed. If you want to enhance the romance for one night, then you only to need to make it on those occasions. This could apply really well if you want to create a romantic look for a night in a hotel room. Consider taking your own bedding to replace the standard, starchy hotel linens and comforter. Using your own soft sheets and more attractive bedspread will enhance the hotel room and give it a feel of home. You may want to replace your current bedding with a set that looks more luxurious, such as silk sheets and fluffy pillows. Red or white bedding also create a romantic feel."

          "headline":"Scent your room for romance.",
          "description":"Two main ways to do this are to scent the room itself and scent the pillows and sheets. To scent the room for a special night, or maintain this consistently, candles, incense, or scented plugins are all good options. Scent the pillows and sheets with the woman's perfume to remind the man of his love for her. There is not necessarily one scent that is automatically romantic, so you may need to experiment and see what scent works for you. Sandalwood and patchouli are both recommended as romantic scents. Vanilla is also usually considered relaxing and romantic. You may want to go with a woody evergreen that reminds you of a cabin in the mountains, or a beachy scent that transports you to a warm hideaway. The romance is in the scent that calms you and fits your relationship's personality. If you are planning for one specific romantic night, make sure you experiment with scent ahead of time to make sure both people enjoy it. A smell that one person doesn't like will instantly ruin any potential romance, no matter how great the rest of the room is. For a hotel room, or a room in your house that's larger than the bedroom, make sure you give the candles or incense plenty of time to burn and fill the whole room. The larger the room, the longer the smell will take to really cover the room. If you are setting up a room besides the bedroom, like a living room, you can still scent the couch or seating. You may even want to spray a basic fabric freshener first to remove any lingering odors before adding a new scent. When planning romance for a specific night, not just in general, consider if you want to leave the candles or incense burning when the night starts or only have them burn long enough to scent the room properly."

          "headline":"Set the temperature and lighting.",
          "description":"This may be a step for occasional romance, rather than an all the time decorative option, but both the room temperature and the lighting are important. You want the room to be just the right temperature. Changing the lighting from the usual can also enhance the romance. Set the thermostat between 68 to 75 \u00b0F (20 to 24 \u00b0C), depending on the outside temperature. You certainly don't want to be cold in the bedroom, but too much heat will be uncomfortable too. For lighting, try changing out your regular light bulbs for ones that are a light, rosy pink, at least in bedside lamps if it's an option. This shade of lighting sets the perfect mood and tends to make people look better. Also, 60 watt or less is best for bedroom lighting. You don't want it to be too bright. Consider what room of the house you are decorating and whether you intend for the changes to last or if they are for a specific moment. You could always move a lamp into a room if ceiling lights are currently the only option. This way, you can easily move the lamp after a specific romantic occasion. Pull the drapes or close the blinds to create an intimate feel. You could also update your window coverings; large drapes that puddle on the floor create a luxurious, romantic vibe."

          "description":"One thing that can dampen romance is the boredom of routine. This can apply to your bedroom if you have had the same setup for a long time. Try moving the bed to a different wall, facing a new direction in the room. Move dressers, chairs or any other furniture to new places as well. Giving the room a completely new look will make it feel almost like you are staying in a romantic getaway rather than your same old room. You may want to draw out potential room layouts before you start moving things to ensure that the setup you hope for is achievable. Maybe your options are limited but drawing it out can help you figure out what could be moved. If moving the entire bed is not an option, especially if space is limited, considering moving the rest of the room around so at least the arrangement is new. If you are working in a living room, you can move the couch to a new location, or maybe move two chairs close together so you can easily sit and talk. Don't have them facing each other head on, but don't have them completely beside each other either. Angle them toward each other while giving those sitting there the option to look slightly away, too. If you are planning a romantic candle-lit dinner in the dining room, remove all but 2 of the chairs. Put the 2 chairs close to each other or across from one another. To make your dining room feel like a private restaurant, put fresh flowers and candles on the table and dim the lights."

          "headline":"Install recessed lighting.",
          "description":"If significant remodeling in the bedroom is an option, putting recessed lights in the wall is great for establishing a better mood. Overhead lights tend to be unflattering, so moving away from those for the bedroom is smart. You will most likely not be able to do this on your own, unless you have specific electrical training, so consider the cost of a contractor and whether it fits your budget. Alternatively, you could put up wall lighting, such as installing footing lights at the bottom of the wall to light up the floor while simultaneously setting the mood. This is also a good time to evaluate the light bulbs you are using. Even if you can't install new lights, you can change bulbs. Go for bulbs with a soft white/or warm white light and use 60 watt or lower so best brightness. Overall, it is good to assess how your room is lit and what ways you can change it. Remodeling and adding new fixed lighting may not work, but consider adding a couple lamps if your room doesn't already have them. For day to day routines, you can still use overhead lighting, but for times when you want to increase the romance, stick to low lit lamps. Dimmer switches are a great addition to any room because they give you the option of having full light for regular daily activities and lower mood lighting for specific romantic occasions."

          "headline":"Invest in a new bed.",
          "description":"This is obviously an expensive and long term option, but since the bed is the centerpiece of the room and the primary location for romance, it can really affect the mood of the room. The bed should ultimately be comfortable, but how it looks is important because you will see if before you feel it. Old or broken down looking beds detract from the romance of the room. A large, wooden, 4 poster bed will give the room a classically romantic look. You can add a canvas canopy which softens the look and feel of the room, as well. Hang drapes down each of the posts to enhance the look. A platform bed that is higher off the ground can add a romantic vibe and make you feel as though you are in a castle or nice hotel. These beds are also practical, as you can store things beneath them to reduce the clutter in your room. Maybe you can't buy an entirely new bed but you can buy a new mattress. A comfier more inviting mattress will increase the romance of the room. Even if you can't buy a mattress, considering buying a down-filled mattress cover which adds a layer of softness to the bed. Lastly, if none of these purchases are within your budget, consider buying new sheets or a bedskirt. Higher thread count sheets are softer. You could buy some red silk sheets for special occasions. Again, the specific color of the sheets is mostly personal preference, but light reds and pinks are often considered the most romantic. For rooms besides the bedroom, considering investing in other new furniture. Your mom's old sofa that sat in the basement for two years is probably not the most romantic piece for you living room. The poker table that doubles as a dining room table may not set the mood you hope for. If it is within your budget, new furniture can be a great way to make a room more romantic."

          "headline":"Hang reminders of romantic memories.",
          "description":"A great way to add romance to a room is to decorate with reminders of your love and what you have shared. Hang up a small cork board and pin pictures from the best times you have had together. Use memorabilia like event tickets, wedding decorations, or gifts you have given each other. By making the room all about your relationship and the life you have built, you'll add romance that goes beyond individual decorations. Have both people make a collage of their favorites pictures of the other person and hang in the room. Make a collage of pictures of you together, especially on specific romantic occasions like high school dances, engagement, wedding photos, first date, weekend trips. The proper hint of nostalgia for good times can add romance to the room. An option for applying this romantic touch throughout multiple rooms could be having a theme for each room such as first experiences (like vacations or activities), a hobby you both enjoy (like movie posters or band memorabilia), or specific occasions where you were dressed fancy (high school dances, weddings, parties). You can also use this technique, maybe to a lesser extent, with a hotel room. By adding personalized touches like pictures, you can take the room to a new level beyond its impersonal basic setup."

It could be a special phrase you have always said to each other like \u201cMy one and only.\u201d\nThe possibilities are endless for how you could add art pieces to the room. A fairly small wooden pallet is a great \u201ccanvas\u201d for painting words of love. You could buy a wooden canvas frame and stretch a piece of white cotton t-shirt around it and paint a message on that. Make a pennant banner with felt pennants, strung up with twine. With one letter on each pennant, spell out \u201clove.\u201d Or use them to show the date of your wedding. Or another significant word or phrase that means a lot to you.

Once the water is fully frozen, take it out. Then:\nWith a hammer and nail, punch holes through the can in the design you want. A simple heart is a good shape to go with.

By doing this, every time you walk into the room you will remember the romance you have shared in the past. If not your own words, paint the words of a favorite poem or love song, or a quote or scripture that speaks to the love you share. Alternatively, paint your favorite love quote on a piece of wood or canvas and hang it above your bed. This can work well as a decoration for a living room or kitchen/dining room, too. For the living room, you could use a favorite quote from a romantic movie and paint it over the TV. Or find a quote that describes the romantic aspects of food for the dining room wall. You could also frame your wedding vows, or a picture of the location where you went on your first date or got engaged or married."
