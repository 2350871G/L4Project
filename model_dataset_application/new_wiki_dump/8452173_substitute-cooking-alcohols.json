          "description":"Bourbon is a sweet kind of whiskey produced in America. To duplicate the sweet flavor imparted by bourbon, use 1 to 2 tsp (7.4 to 10 ml) of vanilla extract for every 2 tablespoons of bourbon. Mix it into your recipe in the same fashion described for adding the bourbon. For recipes that call for less bourbon or that are suited to lighter intensity sweetness, use less vanilla extract. Recipes suited to strong intensity sweetness will benefit from more extract. Bourbon chicken is a recipe where you easily substitute vanilla for bourbon."
