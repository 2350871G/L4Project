          "description":"Choose whichever option appeals the most to you. Aside from the regular Lotto, there are other game options to choose from like EuroMillions, Set For Life, Lotto HotPicks, Thunderball, and Instant Win Games. It might be easier if you decide how much you\u2019re willing to spend and risk before playing a specific game. For example, enter the Set For Life lottery if you want a chance to receive \u00a310,000 per month over 3 decades. On the other hand, play EuroMillions if you want to enter a risky gambit for more money. Thunderball and Lotto HotPicks work similarly to the regular lotto, though the play slip is slightly different."

If you can\u2019t decide on a set of numbers to enter, consider hitting the \u201cLucky Slip\u201d button, which generates random number selections for you. It costs \u00a32.00 to play one round of Lotto numbers. You can buy up to 10 pay slips of entries, if you\u2019d like. The Lotto picks its winning numbers on Wednesday and Saturday, so decide how often you want to play."

It can be tedious to constantly be entering and submitting different plays for the biweekly draws, so the advanced purchase feature can really come in handy for those who wish to gamble in bulk. Depending on your mood, you can purchase up to 4 weeks of plays in advance, or you can charge your card on a weekly basis."

If you\u2019ve entered the regular Lotto, the results will be announced on Wednesday and Saturday at 8:00 PM and 7:45 PM GMT. Compare your selected numbers with the announced winners to see if you\u2019ve won any cash for the week. If some of your numbers match the numbers drawn on television, then you\u2019ve won! If at least 2 of your selected Lotto numbers match the drawing, you\u2019ll win a free lucky dip (random play) for a future Lotto. Having 3 matching numbers gets you \u00a330, while 4 give you \u00a3140. The prizes really get loaded once you start matching 4 or more numbers with the drawing, which equals \u00a31,750 in winnings. You need to match all 6 numbers to win the jackpot. In the event that this doesn\u2019t happen, you need to match at least 5 lottery numbers in addition to the bonus ball to win."

Smaller prizes (below \u00a3500) will be immediately deposited into your lottery funds account, while larger winnings need to be confirmed online. Especially large prizes (over \u00a350,000) need to be collected and processed more personally. Call 03332344433 to set up a meeting.
