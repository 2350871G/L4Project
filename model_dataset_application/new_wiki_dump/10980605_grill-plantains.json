The perfect plantain to grill is a starchy, yellow plantain. It may be hard to find perfectly ripe plantains at your local grocery, so if you plan to grill some, you may want to buy some beforehand and let them ripen at home. You can store green plantains in a paper bag or near other ripe fruit, like apples, to speed up the ripening process."

          "description":"Plantains can be cut a number of different ways, depending on how you plan to prepare them. But when it comes to grilling, the best method is to cut them lengthwise, and keep the peel on so that they do not fall apart when grilled. Use a cutting board on a stable surface and a sharp knife. Cut both ends off and discard. Place the plantains on the cutting board and slice them in half from top to bottom."

          "description":"Even though a lot of your flavor will come from the sauce you use later in the grilling process, it is still important to sprinkle some dry seasoning on top of your plantains ahead of grilling them. A quick and easy option is to coat the plantains in olive oil with some salt and pepper. If you\u2019re looking to add a little spice, you can season with cayenne, red pepper flakes, or other spicy seasonings. If you plan to make your plantains sweet, you can season them with cinnamon or brown sugar before you put them on the grill."

          "description":"Plantains can be seasoned and flavored however you like! You can flavor them with a simple butter and brown sugar glaze for a sweet version, or you can try a spicy, garlicky sauce for a savory edge. Part of the beauty of cooking plantains is their versatility. Find what flavor works for you! Wait until you are grilling the plantains to apply the sauce it as it may cause them to stick to the grill. Make a sauce thick enough to coat the plantains without running down into the grill."

A dirty grilling surface can add unwanted flavors to your dish. Use soap and water, cleaning rags, and a grill brush, if you are using an outside grill, to scrub down the grilling surface. Remove any built up grease. Clean blocked gas ports if you\u2019re using a gas grill, as this can be a fire hazard. Be sure to turn off the gas before you start cleaning if you are using a gas grill!

A simple way to avoid this issue is to lightly oil the grilling surface with an oil that has a neutral flavor and a high smoking point, which keeps it from burning and altering the flavor of the plantains. Simply brush or wipe the grilling surface with a light layer of oil! Vegetable oil is always a good option to use as it does not have a strong flavor and will not burn easily. Be sure you apply the oil before you start to heat the grilling surface and allow it to reach peak cooking temperature to burn off the excess oil."
