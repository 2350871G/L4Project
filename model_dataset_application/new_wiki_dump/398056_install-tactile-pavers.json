      "description":"Since the pavers are embedded or surrounded by a concrete curb, you will want to make a recessed block-out in your sidewalk for them to set in. Here are the points you will want to consider when doing this. Size the blocked out area so an equal number of pavers will fit, without requiring border cuts. Typical pavers are cast with an eight thousand PSI concrete mix, and cutting them can be time consuming and difficult. Measuring the actual size of the pavers and dividing the overall size of the paver bed, then adjusting the dimensions will make it possible to fill the space within reasonable tolerances without cutting any border pavers. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/93\\/Install-Tactile-Pavers-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Install-Tactile-Pavers-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/93\\/Install-Tactile-Pavers-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/aid398056-v4-728px-Install-Tactile-Pavers-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nMeasure the thickness of your pavers, then make the recess concrete block out about one to one and one half inches deeper than this thickness, to allow for a setting bed of compacted sand. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/22\\/Install-Tactile-Pavers-Step-2Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Install-Tactile-Pavers-Step-2Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/22\\/Install-Tactile-Pavers-Step-2Bullet2.jpg\\/aid398056-v4-728px-Install-Tactile-Pavers-Step-2Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nMake sure the border curb that surrounds the paver bed meets the construction requirements of your job, if applicable.
