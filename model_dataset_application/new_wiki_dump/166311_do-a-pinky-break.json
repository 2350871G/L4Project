Hold the pinky break to keep those 2 cards separated from the deck at the back right-hand corner. When you are doing the pinky break and double lift in front of an audience, it\u2019s a good idea to talk to use misdirection techniques so that they don\u2019t focus as much on what you are doing with your hands and the deck. For example, you can use flashy \"magic\" hand gestures with your free hand to draw their eyes to other motions."
