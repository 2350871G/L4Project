You will see it growing at a low height and spreading all over the place. Since many edible and inedible plants grow in this fashion, it is necessary to properly identify the plant at this stage. You can find chickweed in shady, wet areas in cities. Chickweed does really well in cultivated areas such as the side of a farm field or the edges of your garden. Chickweed likes pH balanced soil. Chickweed will often grow beside other edible herbs such as dandelion, cleavers, plantain, horsetail, fennel and nettle."

Find an expert in edible plants by contacting your local chapter of a Native Plant Society. Find the local chapter online or in your local phonebook.
