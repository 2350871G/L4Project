  "text":" Making the Stand Make a stand just for baking. Ice cream cones don't sit flat on a surface, because of their pointed edges. This part shows how make the stand so the cupcakes can stand while they bake. Cover a large springform pan with aluminum foil. Wrap it around several times, adding enough foil over the entire top of the pan. Use a small knife or scissors to poke a tiny slit or 'hole' in the center of the foil.  Push the pointed tip of an ice cream cone through the hole, until the pointed edge of the cone rests on the bottom of the pan.  Repeat with the rest of the ice cream cones.  Baking the Cupcakes Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 Fahrenheit (177\u00b0 Celsius).  Make the cupcake batter. Follow the cake mix's instructions on making the cupcake batter. Add the correct amount of ingredients and combine properly with a rubber spatula or whisk, until there are no more flour streaks. Spoon or pipe the cupcake batter into the cones. Using a frosting pipe or ice cream scoop, spoon or pipe the cupcake batter into the cones, filling them about 2/3 full. Bake the cupcakes in the oven for about 15-20 minutes, until the cupcakes rise and bake fully.  Remove the cupcakes from the oven. Let them cool for about ten minutes before decorating. Decorating and Serving Pour the leaf sprinkles into a small bowl for rolling.  Cover a large tray with parchment paper.  Cut off the pointed edges of the cones using a knife.  Use a knife to trim off the tops of all the cupcakes to form a smooth and flat bottom.  Melt the candy melts in a microwave until fully melted. Every 30 seconds, stir gently with a spoon, until the chocolate is smooth and has melted thoroughly. Dip and coat the cupcakes into the melted candy melts. The edges or sides of the cone should also get coated. Dip each cupcake into the leaf sprinkles and gently roll it around. The edges and sides of the cone should also get covered as well. Set the cupcakes on the tray for about ten minutes. Let the chocolate harden by leaving the cupcakes to set on the smooth surface. Pour the remaining melted candy melts in a Ziploc bag. Snip the corner of the bag with scissors so it makes a simple piping bag. Decorate the tops of the 'tepees'. Pipe the chocolate on the tops of the cones. Stick three pretzels into it as well. Repeat with the rest of the cupcakes. Let the chocolate harden for about ten minutes.  Serve. Remove the 'tepees' from the large tray and place them on a serving plate. Enjoy! Finished. ",
