The diameter of the circles is equal to the height of the almond shapes. Leave some space between the bottom of the circle  and the lower edge of  the eye shape. Draw an arc for each eye to create tear ducts.  Draw the eyes' waterline. Draw these from the base of the tear duct passing between the iris and lower eyelid going to the upper lash line.
