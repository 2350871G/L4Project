          "headline":"Hang artwork or family photos on white walls to showcase them.",
          "description":"Since white walls serve as a great backdrop for artwork, you can take advantage of this in your home by hanging lots of pictures, paintings, or other framed items on the walls. Let the white walls lead the eye to the artwork or pictures. Make sure to space out the pictures so that there will be at least 6 inches (15 cm) of white space between each of them. If you have a large picture or piece of artwork, then choose a wall to hang it on and don\u2019t hang anything else on that wall. You might even leave the other walls bare so that nothing in the room will compete with this picture. For a fun, bold look, you can create a \u201cgallery wall\u201d with 3 or more art pieces or photographs (or even a mixture of both). You could also hang a decorative tapestry on the wall. This could be a woven macram\u00e9, an ornate rug, an actual tapestry, or even a beautiful scarf or shawl. In addition to being decorative, the cloth can also help reduce echo in the room."

          "headline":"Choose 1 bold accent color to set off white walls.",
          "description":"White walls can be overwhelming, especially if there is not much color in the room or if you have chosen a neutral palette for the rest of the room. Select a couple of objects in the same bright color and place them at opposite ends of the room, or place 1 in the center and 1 on the side of the room. For purple accents in the bedroom, you could put out a vase of purple irises on your bedside table and hang a small painting of an iris on the opposite wall. For a pop of yellow in the kitchen, place a bowl of lemons on a counter and a vase of yellow daffodils on the kitchen table. To add red accents to the living room, place a bright red ceramic sculpture on your bookshelf or coffee table, and toss a neatly folded, bright red throw blanket over the edge of the sofa. Metallics, such as gold, also make great accent colors. For example, you could place a gold bowl on a coffee table and a picture or mirror in a gold frame on the wall."

          "headline":"Use white walls as a backdrop for several colorful, eclectic d\u00e9cor pieces.",
          "description":"If you have white walls, you also have the option of going crazy with color! You can choose eclectic pieces in a variety of colors and sprinkle them throughout the room for all-over color. Choose colorful pictures, bright throw pillows, and bold colored ceramic items to place throughout the room. To add colorful accents to the bedroom, you could cover the bed with throw pillows in the same colors as a painting on the wall, such as bright green, yellow, pink, and blue throw pillows. For colorful accents in the living room, cover a wall with several colorful paintings in brightly-colored picture frames. To make a white bathroom more colorful, choose a multicolor shower curtain with a brightly-colored bath rug."

        {
          "headline":"Include shiny metal items to complement gleaming white walls.",
          "description":"White walls have a clean, bright look to them, and you can make them stand out even more by adding a few shiny items to the room. Choose furniture, appliances, d\u00e9cor elements, and fixtures that are made from stainless steel, or that have a shiny black, red, or other colored surface. For example, you could get a stainless steel refrigerator in your kitchen, add shiny stainless steel faucets to the bathroom sink, or place a stainless steel nightstand in the bedroom. You can also find furniture with a shiny metal finish, such as gleaming apple red stools for your breakfast bar. For a shiny metal accent piece, get a stainless steel sculpture to place on your dining room table or on a bookshelf. If you\u2019d like a more edgy or industrial look, go for more natural-looking metals such as steel or iron. For example, you could put up a bookshelf with iron piping or brackets."

          "headline":"Add text and designs to your white walls with stencils and decals.",
          "description":"White walls are the perfect backdrop for a special quote, design, or monogram. You can get stencils and acrylic paint to decorate white walls with the text or design of your choice, or you can choose premade decals to stick the text and designs you want directly onto your walls. Make sure your walls are clean and dry before applying stencils or decals. Use a wet paper towel or washcloth to wipe down the walls. Then, dry the walls with a paper towel or clean, dry towel. Choose a position on the wall where the text and designs will be easily visible and not in the way of anything you want to hang on the wall. Also, don\u2019t place the decals in an area where furniture might cover them. If you have a kitchen with white walls, try putting up a chalkboard decal on one of the walls. You can use it to write grocery lists, menus, or notes. This would also work well in a home office."

        {
          "headline":"Install wall sconces to shine light on your white walls.",
          "description":"You can opt for wall-mounted lighting in a room with white walls, such as sconces. These will help to illuminate white walls even more. Choose sconces that match the rest of your d\u00e9cor, or opt for something that goes well with anything, such as a plain white sconce or a stainless steel sconce. Or, pick a bright color to make the sconces stand out. Try mounting sconces in a hallway with white walls to create a subtle tunnel of light. Place wall sconces above the nightstands in your bedroom for soft lighting while you relax in bed. Add a wall sconce above or below a piece of artwork in your living room to draw even more attention to it. If you don\u2019t want to install new wiring for a wall sconce, you can get sconces that plug into electrical outlets instead. These are a good option if you rent or are decorating on a budget."

          "description":"You can hang any color curtains you like in a white room, but you may want to choose curtains that will complement the rest of your d\u00e9cor. For instance, pick navy curtains to complement a navy and white rug. If you want your white room to pop with red, then get some bright red curtains. You can try floor length curtains, window length curtains, or shorter than window length curtains that let in lots of extra light! Opt for opaque curtains to make the room dark, such as when you are sleeping, or sheer curtains to let in lots of natural light, such as in your kitchen or living room. Or, you could put a layer of sheer curtains over a layer of opaque curtains if you expect to need both."

          "headline":"Paint your windowsills to add a pop of color.",
          "description":"You can offset the white on your walls by painting the windowsills a bright color, like blue or red. Try choosing a paint in a color that will draw attention to the windows if you want people to notice them. Try blue windowsills in the kitchen for an eye-catching accent. Opt for a light grey paint on windowsills in the bedroom for a subtle contrast. Try black windowsills in your office for something bold and severe."

          "description":"Natural wood pieces look great with white walls because they go together so well. Look for pieces that are made from oak, cherry, maple, or other types of wood. A lighter piece of wood furniture will brighten a room, while a darker piece will make it seem darker and more rugged. You can also get pieces that have a natural wood finish for a less expensive option. Get an oak dresser to add neutral tones and texture to a white bedroom. Opt for a cherry dining room table in your dining room for an elegant complement to your white walls. Try placing a maple table and chairs in the corner of a white kitchen for a warm, inviting breakfast nook. If your white walls are clean and bright, keep the furniture clean as well, so that it will not create an unpleasant contrast with the walls. Polish or wax your furniture regularly so that it stays clean and shiny."

Opt for pieces that are in neutral shades to really bring out the white and give the room a warm, homey feel. Try adding a wicker coffee table to your living room for a casual centerpiece. Place a wicker laundry hamper in your bathroom for an attractive place to toss dirty laundry. Set a wicker chair in your kitchen for somewhere cozy to rest while you bake a batch of cookies."

Select 1 or more pieces of white furniture to go with your white walls. Choose furniture in the same shade of white that is on the walls for an even more dramatic effect. Get a white sofa for your living room and allow your seating area to meld with the walls. Place a white kitchen table in your kitchen for an inviting place to serve meals. Select a white dresser for your bedroom to wake up to an even brighter space."

Try getting a piece of furniture that makes a statement and place it in a white room so that visitors will be drawn to it. Place an orange mod-style chair in your living room for a striking piece that everyone will want to sit in. Select a bed with an oversized headboard for a dramatic addition to your bedroom. You could also choose a canopy bed and decorate it with flowing white linens to add a touch of softness to the white room. Choose a clear glass dining room table to create the illusion of more space."

          "description":"White can make a room seem overwhelmingly bright if there is too much of it, so you might want to balance it out with a few darker pieces of furniture. Rugged finishes like black metal, mahogany, and espresso finished wood are great options to add a little darkness to the room. Try including a black metal coffee table for an interesting place to entertain guests. Select a mahogany headboard for a warm and inviting bedroom. Place an espresso-colored desk in your office to create a more somber workspace."

          "headline":"Opt for colorful furniture to make a white room more vibrant.",
          "description":"Since white goes with anything, you could also choose furniture in bold colors. Choose furniture in 1 color, in a couple of complementary colors, or in a rainbow of colors! For example, you could place a blue sofa and chairs in a white room. Another option is to place a purple couch and a yellow chair in the same room. For a spectrum of color, choose a red couch, a purple chair, a blue chair, a green coffee table, a yellow lamp, and an orange accent table."

Look for laminate flooring that looks like natural wood floors, such as oak, cherry, and maple. If you already have natural wood floors in the white room, then keep them uncovered and polished.

Dark flooring also helps you to keep the focus on the walls and ceiling in a white room, which can make the room seem bigger. Look for laminate flooring or carpet in shades of black, dark brown, plum, and navy. You could also use concrete floors for a bold, industrial modern look."

Try adding a brightly-colored print rug for a pop of color and texture, or choose something more subdued for a subtle accent. For example, you could place a black and red checker print rug in the living room to accentuate the red details in the room. For more color, select a purple and yellow floral print rug for your bedroom to tie in with other floral elements. Go with an animal print rug in your office to maintain a neutral color palette with some extra flair."
