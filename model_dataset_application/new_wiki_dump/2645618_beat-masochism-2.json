      "headline":"Level 1: Low Precision.",
      "description":"Fairly straightforward. To get the sapphire, take the steps up, and jump onto the somewhat hidden platform at the top of the screen. You won't be able to see yourself, but make a blind jump and try to land into the gap between the spike and block. From here it's a mad rush to the exit to get the 7 second sapphire."

      "headline":"Level 4: Gridlocked.",
      "description":"This is more puzzle than it is action. To get the sapphire, you'll need to make it all the way to the platform directly under the finish line before the first line of spikes passes by. There, hit the bottom of the finish line, in order to get a time boost to reach the 6 second sapphire."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Level 5: High Precision.",
      "description":"This is very hard, it will take a few hundred tries at least. You'll need to make it to the bottom and time your drop before the first row of continuous spikes pass by (five spikes in a row with no gap), from there, rush your way up to the exit. There's no need to jump up to the single platform on the top-left, as it will waste your time. Find the best way and be efficient here for the sapphire."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Level 6: Flashback.",
      "description":"At the start of the level, drop left and hold right. This will save you two jumps, which is needed for the sapphire. There's no need to rush on this level, because the achievement is not for time but for the number of jumps. If you do everything right you should have exactly five jumps."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Level 7: Flipside.",
      "description":"Don't rush to the right at the beginning. You won't make it. Instead, wait for the blocks to switch into spikes, and jump to the right before the very moment that the spikes turn back into blocks. This should give you a \"boost\" or a few blocks advantage. Getting the star here is relatively easy."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Level 8: Spikefield.",
      "description":"There are no shortcuts to this level. Make a route to the star, and to the exit. It IS possible, trust me on this one. There are hidden platforms under the star."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Level 9: Maximum Precision.",
      "description":"The timing for the sapphire is much more forgiving on this one. Otherwise, it's pretty straightforward."

    {
      "headline":"Level 10: The Great Space Chase.",
      "description":"Keep running right. In a few tries you should understand how it goes. In order to get the sapphire, which requires you to never let go of the right arrow key, just hold the left arrow key when you want to stop. Basically, instead of releasing the right arrow key to stop moving right, hold BOTH the left and right arrow keys to stop."

      "headline":"Level 12: Another Anti-climatic Boss.",
      "description":"The weak point of the boss is the flashing thing on its head. To get all 5 stars, collect the first 4 before you trigger the lava (it is triggered by attacking the boss for the first time). Using the platform that falls down when you attack him for the first time, the fifth star should be accessible. Attack him again, then again, and the goal should finally appear.
