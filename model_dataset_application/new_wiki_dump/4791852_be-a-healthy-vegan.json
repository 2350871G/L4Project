          "description":"B12 promotes healthy functioning of the brain and nervous system and is an essential vitamin for any healthy person. The recommended daily intake for adults is 2.4 micrograms. However, B12 only naturally occurs in animal foods. Since B12 is not found in plant-based foods, vegans need to find ways to supplement their diet with foods that have been fortified with B12. Look for the following:\nBreakfast cereals or oatmeal that have been fortified with vitamin B12. Check the labeling to make sure eating the cereal will give you the recommended daily intake. Soy milk, Rice milk, and some other plant milks are also often fortified with B12. B12 supplements are popular among vegans. Since B12 is the only vitamin you can\u2019t get by eating plants, it might be worth adding this supplement to your daily routine."
