  "text":" Roasting Corn on the Cob Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C). Let your oven heat up while you shuck the corn and prepare it for roasting. Remove the outer leaves of each ear of corn. Each ear of corn is enveloped in light green leaves called the husk.

Expose the tip of each piece of corn to create a \u201czipper.\u201d Peel back the remaining inner leaves at the end of each cob until you see a few yellow kernels peeking out. Think of these pulled back leaves as the corn\u2019s \"zipper.\" The tassels are the silky strings bunched at the end of the cob. Pull the \u201czipper\u201d down firmly with your dominant hand.

Pull the husk all the way down to the bottom of the cob, and keep pulling until the husk is inverted. This will also expose thin, silky strands on the inside of the husk. Pull the husk off the cob in 1 smooth motion. Keep your dominant hand on the inverted husk. Quickly snap your wrist to pull the husk off the end of the cob. Try to do this in 1 smooth motion. Discard the husk and the silky strands that came with it. Pull off the remaining silky strands with your fingers. Some of the silky strands may cling to the corn kernels after you remove the husk. Use your fingers to pull off any silk still clinking to the cob. Discard the silky strands. Smear about \u00bd tablespoon of softened butter on each ear of corn. Let the butter soften at room temperature for a few minutes, then use a butter knife to spread about \u00bd tablespoon of it onto each cob. Be sure to spread the softened butter from the top to the bottom of the ear, then all the way around. Wrap each buttered ear of corn individually in aluminum foil. After smearing on the butter, place the ear of corn on a small sheet of aluminum foil. Fold the foil around the ear so that it\u2019s fully encased. Do this for all 4 cobs, wrapping each one individually in foil. Bake the corn for 20 to 25 minutes. Place each ear of corn onto a baking sheet. Carefully place the baking sheet into the preheated oven. Remove the baking sheet and serve the corn. The foil will be very hot, so let it cool for a few minutes or wear gloves to unwrap each ear of corn. Serve the corn immediately. You can serve it as is, still on the cob, or you can slice the kernels off of each cob and serve it that way. Baking a Corn Casserole Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Let your oven heat up while you put the casserole together. Combine the corn, muffin mix, sour cream, and butter in a bowl. Pour both cans of corn and the package of corn muffin mix into a large mixing bowl. Use a spoon to combine them. Add the sour cream and melted butter to the bowl and stir the mixture until completely incorporated. The mixture will be slightly lumpy. Pour the mixture into a greased 9 in (23 cm) x 13 in (33 cm) dish. Spray your casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray, taking care to coat all sides of it evenly. Transfer the corn mixture from the  bowl to the casserole dish. Bake the corn casserole uncovered for 45 minutes. Place the corn casserole into the preheated oven. When the casserole has lightly browned on top, carefully remove the dish from the oven. Place the casserole on a heat-resistant surface. Top the casserole with cheese and bake it for 5 to 10 more minutes. Sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese evenly over the entire surface of the corn casserole. Use an oven mitt to place the dish back into the oven. Let it bake at the same temperature for another 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the casserole from the oven when the cheese has completely melted. Let the casserole stand for 5 minutes, then serve. Set the casserole on a heat-resistant surface and let it cool down for about 5 minutes. Use a large spoon to scoop out and plate each serving. Serve the dish warm. Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and store them in the fridge for up to 3 days. Making Roasted Corn and Pepper Salsa Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C) and prepare a baking sheet. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spray the foil evenly with nonstick cooking spray. Remove the husks and silk from the 4 ears of corn. Peel off the light green outer leaves. Gently peel back the remaining inner leaves at the end of each cob. Think of these pulled back leaves as the corn\u2019s \"zipper.\" Grab the \u201czipper\u201d and tassels and pull them off each ear in 1 smooth motion. Snap the leaves off the ends, then pull off any remaining silk from the kernels with your fingers. Cover each ear with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of melted butter and season. Place the shucked corn on the foil-lined baking sheet. Use a butter knife to smear 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of melted butter onto each ear. Be sure to spread the butter from the base to the tip of the piece of corn, and then all the way around it. Season each ear with sea salt and pepper. Add the whole peppers to the baking sheet. Rinse the poblanos and jalapeno off with water, then pat them dry. Place the whole peppers onto the baking sheet with the corn. Spray the tops of the peppers with nonstick cooking spray. Spread the veggies out on the baking sheet so none of them are overlapping. Roast them for 10 minutes, then flip and roast for 10 more minutes. Place the baking sheet into the preheated oven. After roasting for 10 minutes, use tongs to quickly flip over each ear of corn and all of the peppers. Pull out the peppers and continue roasting the corn. Use tongs to flip each piece of corn over again, then remove the roasted peppers from the baking sheet. Close the oven door. Put the peppers in a container with a tight-fitting lid. Let the peppers sit for 15 to 20 minutes while the corn continues to roast. Combine the onions and red wine vinegar in a bowl. Dice the red onion and place it in a medium sized bowl. Pour the red wine vinegar over the onion. Set this aside to marinate for 10 minutes while you finish preparing the salsa. Peel the skin from the roasted peppers and dice them. Remove the peppers from the container. Use a sharp knife to peel off the skin from all of them. Cut into each pepper and remove the ribs and seeds from the inside. Discard these. Dice the peppers and add them to the bowl with the onions and vinegar. Remove the roasted corn and cut the kernels off of each cob. The corn kernels should be lightly browned when you remove them from the oven. Let the ears cool for a few minutes so that you can handle them. Use a sharp knife to slice the kernels off of each piece. Add the corn and cilantro to the bowl with the other ingredients. Chop the fresh cilantro. Place the roasted corn kernels and the fresh cilantro into the bowl with the onions and vinegar. Add the remaining seasonings to the bowl, then stir well to combine the mixture. Cover the salsa and refrigerate it for 30 minutes. Use plastic wrap or a tight-fitting lid to cover the bowl of salsa. Put the bowl into your fridge and let the flavors develop for about 30 minutes. Pull out the salsa and taste it. Adjust the salt to taste, if needed. Serve the roasted corn salsa with your favorite tortilla chips.",
