          "description":"Porcelain grill grates can chip easily if you use a metal or wire bristle brush. Avoid this by using a soft bristle brush, such as a brush made with nylon bristles. This way, the porcelain is not at risk of getting damaged when you clean it. A medium bristle toothbrush and a scouring pad will also be helpful for removing grime from smaller areas. You can get a standard square head soft bristle grill brush or try a grill brush with a rounded head. A soft bristle grill brush with a rounded head can make it easier to clean the grates."

          "description":"Take the soft bristle brush and run it diagonally along the grates. Do this in smooth, fluid motions from the bottom to the top of the grates. Running the brush diagonally over the grates, rather than straight over the grates will make it easier to remove food and grease on the grates. Keep the brush flat to avoid the head from damaging the grates. Do one pass over the grates with the brush in a diagonal motion. If there are any really greasy or sticky parts of the grill, lightly go over the area a few times with the brush. Do not scrub too hard on the grates as this can damage them. Use the scouring pad or toothbrush to get small or hard-to-reach areas. If the grill grates can be flipped over, use an oven mitt or heat-proof gloves to flip over the grates and clean the other side with the grill brush."

After removing the food and turning off the heat, clean the grates with the brush while they are still warm. Then, apply a light cooking oil or grease to the grates so the grill is ready for the next use."

Ball up aluminum foil, making a ball large enough to fit over your fingers. Then, run the aluminum foil over the grates to remove any debris and clean them. Clean the grates with tin foil when they are cool or not too hot to prevent burning your fingers.

Let it sit for 20 minutes and then clean it off with a soft bristle grill brush. Make sure you get all of the paste off before you cook anything on the grill, and clean the brush when you\u2019re done.

A wet grill brush can help to remove debris on the grates effectively. Let the grill grates heat up. Then, dip the grill brush in a bucket of water to get it wet. Run the wet grill brush over the grates in a diagonal motion, starting from the bottom of the grate and going upward. Dip the grill brush back in the bucket of water to rinse it and continue to clean any other areas on the grates with the wet brush."
