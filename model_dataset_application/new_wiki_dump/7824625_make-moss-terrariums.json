If you would like to house animals in your terrarium, choose one that is appropriately sized for the species and quantity. The smaller the terrarium, the easier it is to control humidity and keep it clean. Larger containers can hold more moss and make great center pieces for tables and desks. If you plan on keeping animals in your terrarium, choose a glass one. Plastic is less expensive but overheats easily and can leach chemicals into water sources or even melt if left in direct sunlight. Glass is much easier to clean, but breaks easily. Any terrarium should have a secure top, whether made of glass, plastic, or even cork. If is houses animals, it should have a lid with some sort of ventilation."

Newly sprouted oak tree saplings, ferns, and colorful weed-like sprouts are fun and easy to grow. Oak saplings should be clipped every few months so that they fit inside their container.

Moss should not be layered, or mold can grow due to the lack of drainage. Different colored mosses make beautiful patterns, but different types of moss really pull your terrarium together. Some moss grows in flower or star-shapes. Other types grow like grass or are tightly clustered. If you have Spanish moss or a similar hanging species, you can tape it to the sides, trap it in the lid of the terrarium so it hangs down, or scatter it. One of the best methods is to add a stick or large rock in the middle of your terrarium, then hang the moss on it so it drapes into the container's floor. Moss should barely press up against the side of the terrarium, don't pack it too tightly!"

Sticks and tree branches can be added, as can small sources of water to keep humidity up, such as a bowl or cap-full of water.

Good insect species include roly-polies (pill bugs), safe millipedes, harmless beetles, and snails/slugs. For toads and frogs, most species will eventually have to be moved to a more permanent home, as with some species of salamander, though most can live their lives in a terrarium with no problem.
