      "description":"In the U.S. Concrete is always ordered in cubic yards. First figure out the cubic footage, then convert to yards by dividing by 27. Here's how: multiply the length of your project times the width times the depth (4 in. = . 33 ft.) and divide the total by 27. Using a sidewalk as an example: 60 feet (18.3 m). (long) x 4 feet (1.2 m). (wide) x .33 feet (0.1 m). (deep) = 79.2 cu. ft. \u00f7 27 = 2.93 cu. yards.You can also figure your cubic yards by this example: length, times, width, divided by, 12, times, thickness, divided by, 27. using the figures from above example. 60 ft ( length ), times 4 ft (width), divided by 12,  times  4 inches (10.2 cm) (thickness),  divided by  27 = 2.96 cubic yards. Concrete is cheap and nothing is worse than coming up short (except rain). A good rule of thumb is to order an extra 5 percent rounded up to the next \u20444 yard (0.2 m). to handle spillage and uneven bases."
