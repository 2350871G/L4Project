Leave at least 2-inches of room between each ball on the sheet. Bake them for 6 to 8 minutes or until they start turning light brown. For a more festive look, consider rolling the balls in colored sugar or sprinkles."

You'll need to press down a little using the Hershey's Kiss. This will also help the cookies spread a little. Let the cookies cool on a wire rack. This recipe will make about 48 cookies."
