          "description":"Unless your house has never been lived in, it is important to make sure your dryer vent is free and clear of all debris, as a blocked vent may be a fire hazard. Most home improvement stores can sell you an inexpensive vent brush. Starting from indoors, insert the brush a few inches and spin, then remove the brush and clean off the bristles. Repeat until the bristles come out clean. After cleaning the indoor side of the vent, go outside and remove the vent hood to ensure it is clear of all lint and debris. It's a good idea to clean your vent every two years. In addition to the safety issues that a blocked vent can cause, drying clothes with a blocked vent can damage your dryer and void your warranty."

If space permits, it is a good idea to use a metal vent duct, as ribbed plastic and aluminum hoses can catch lint and clog more easily. Joints in the metal duct should be sealed with duct tape, as screws may also catch lint. The end should fit snugly into the machine, so no clamps or tape should be needed. The straighter the vent, the better it will function, as lint can gather in areas where the hose bends. This is another good reason to use metal ducting rather than a plastic or flexible aluminum hose. If using a plastic vent hose, slip a circular dryer clamp over the hose to hold it securely in place. Make sure your clamps are the right size and fit tightly. Many hoses come with clamps that are made to fit."

Keep in mind that your dryer will need about four inches of additional space in the back for venting. Make sure the floor is stable.

The instructions provided here will apply to most washers and dryers, but you should read the instructions that came with your machines in case they include any special features that might require additional steps. Installing the Dryer Check and clean your dryer vent. Unless your house has never been lived in, it is important to make sure your dryer vent is free and clear of all debris, as a blocked vent may be a fire hazard. Most home improvement stores can sell you an inexpensive vent brush. Starting from indoors, insert the brush a few inches and spin, then remove the brush and clean off the bristles.

If using a flexible hose, clamp it into place, as in step 3. A metal duct will not require clamps but should just slide into place. Plug in the dryer and move it into its final position.  Installing the Washer Run some water through the faucets. Place a bucket or tub underneath the hot and cold water outlets you'll be hooking up to and run some water through each. This will clear any debris that might clog your valve screens. Afterwards, make sure the faucets are turned completely off. Move the washing machine into place. Make sure you have enough room to navigate either to the side of the washing machine or behind it to hook up the water supplies.

With some washing machine models, you may find it is already connected, so you can skip this step. Run the drain hose to the drain receptacle. Depending on your plumbing, you'll need to feed the hose into a drain on the floor, the wall, or into a laundry sink, or there may be a rigid pipe that extends down to a floor drain.

Plug in the washing machine and push it into place against the wall.  Finishing Up Check to make sure both machines are level. Uneven floor or incorrectly adjusted legs may prevent the machines from sitting flat. A level, available at any hardware store, will make it easy to tell if this is the case. Failure to level your machines may result in damage to your machines or floor. Adjust the feet at the bottom of each machine as needed. Lift or tip the machines slightly off the ground to adjust the feet. Some feet will self-level and will fall down to the floor as you lift. Others will need to be twisted counterclockwise to loosen and level the machines' feet. Consult the instructions that came with your machines for information on how to level them. Some machines require you to install feet or pads before you begin installing the machine. Run both machines to ensure that they are working. The washing machine should fill and drain completely, while the dryer should heat up quickly.",
