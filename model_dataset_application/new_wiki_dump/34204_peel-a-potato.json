There are two generic \"shapes\" potato peelers; here's how to hold each one:\nIf you have a standard long potato peeler, hold it like a paint roller, with your thumb balancing it in your fingers, but still away from the blade. If you have a Y-shaped potato peeler, hold it like a pencil. This way is more efficient, and you\u2019re less likely to hurt yourself. It should be resting between your middle finger and thumb (of your dominant hand), with your pointer finger holding it in position."

Start at the base and try to make one swift motion all the way up the potato. Ideally, you should be peeling off the skin in strips. This goes for both shapes of potato peelers, even the y-shaped ones. Though it's possible grandma held it differently and drew it into her, this way you'll find results in a much cleaner potato. Some potatoes are a bit fussier than others and the skin will come off in chunks \u2013 especially if the potato isn\u2019t smooth and round. Pay special attention to these areas to get every last bit off; they'll need extra work (and a slower peel, lest you hurt yourself)."

This isn't a speed contest; go as slowly and patiently as you have to to avoid hurting yourself or taking off the good parts of the potato. Going slowly at first can help you perfect your technique for later, too."
