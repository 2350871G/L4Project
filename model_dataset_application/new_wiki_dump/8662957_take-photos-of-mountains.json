          "headline":"Use a small aperture.",
          "description":"The aperture is the opening through which light enters your camera lens. Most cameras allow you to adjust your aperture in the settings. For photographing mountains, avoid photographing at either send of the aperture (either too wide or too narrow). This helps both mountain peaks and foregrounds to stay in focus. Try using an aperture setting around 2-3 f-stops from the widest aperture to get the best focus for a mountain shot. Wider apertures are better for focusing on close-up details, so they are not ideal for mountain photography. Every camera is different. Consult your instructions manual to figure out how to change the settings on your camera."

          "headline":"Try a wide-angle lens to include as much scenery as possible.",
          "description":"Wide lenses (anything with a focal length of 35mm or wider) are great if you want to capture dramatic views that include large amounts of foreground, midground, and sky. This type of lens is perfect if you want to photograph a low foreground feature (such as a plant or rock formation) while also including much of the mountain and surrounding scenery in the background. Keep in mind that wide-angle lenses can distort your image, making parallel lines appear to converge as they get farther away from the camera. You can try playing with this distortion to create interesting effects, or minimize it by keeping the horizon in the middle of your frame.

Consider the rule of thirds and the rule of nine. Or Gozal, photographer, tells us: \"Try breaking up the shot into different quadrants so no single part of the shot is overwhelming and so you keep the viewer engaged with the image. For instance, you might have the sky take up a third of the shot, the mountain the middle section, and a subject the bottom third.\""

        {
          "headline":"Choose a narrower lens to capture the size of the mountain.",
          "description":"Wide lenses are great for capturing large swaths of the landscape. However, they can also make mountain peaks look smaller and more distant than a narrower lens would. If you're interested in focusing on a single peak, try a narrower focal length (e.g., 70mm). This will help you fill the frame with the mountain and make it look more impressive. Experiment with different lens widths and different zoom levels to get the shot you want."

        {
          "headline":"Make use of filters to bring out the landscape's colors.",
          "description":"Good filters can help you make the best of natural light and atmospheric conditions while you are shooting. The right filter will depend on the conditions and the kind of shot you are trying to get. Experiment with using:\nPolarizing filters. These reduce harsh glare in sunny conditions and enhance the saturation of the colors in a shot. Try using a polarizing filter when you're shooting in full daylight. Graduated neutral density filters. Graduated ND filters are great if you're shooting a dark mountain against a bright sky. They can reduce the glare at the top of the image while preserving the subtle highlights and shadows of the middle and foreground. Warming filters. These enhance the warmth of a photo by bringing out reds and oranges and reducing blue tones. Warming filters can be helpful when you're shooting on overcast days."

          "headline":"Bring a tripod.",
          "description":"A small, lightweight tripod is necessary for the best mountain shots. You do not have to use it for every shot you take, but it can help steady the camera. Bring a tripod with you on a hike if you're going to be shooting mountains. Make sure the tripod is adjustable so you can take shots from different angles."

Wear hiking boots and dress in warm, protective clothing, especially if you're going to be hiking at high altitudes to get your shot. It's always a good idea to hike with another person, if possible. They can help share some of the load if you're bringing photography equipment as well as other hiking supplies!"

Sunrises and sunsets light up the sky with shades of pink, orange, red, and yellow, which may be reflected in bodies of water or the mountains themselves. For the most colorful imagery, try getting shots just before sunrise and just before nightfall."

          "description":"When hiking during the day, stop and observe the sun. Then, turn 90\u00b0 from wherever the sun is in the sky. The scene you see will be lit by what is called side lighting. Shoot whatever scene is here. Side lighting is generally solid and crisp lighting for mountain photographs. Experiment with different filters and lenses when shooting scenes using side lighting. You may not get the exact shot you wanted relying on side lighting, but you may be surprised by some of the stunning images you find."

          "description":"If you're looking to convey the shape and form of mountains, opt for back lighting. Back lighting is provided when the sun is directly behind the mountains. This generally emphasizes the outlines or silhouette of the mountains themselves rather than the color or details of the scene. If you want to shoot with backlighting, aim to be in the mountains just before sunrise or just before sunset, depending on how the mountains are oriented."

          "description":"Midday photographs provide overwhelming light, as the mountains will be lit directly from above. The color is generally neutral, and the texture is not as intricate. Spend the midday hiking to the peaks you want to shoot around nightfall rather than taking pictures. This may be a good opportunity to take some closeup photos of details you spot along the way, such as an interesting plant or a mossy stump by the side of the hiking path."

          "headline":"Do not hesitate to shoot on cloudy days.",
          "description":"Cloudy days do not mean you have to quit and go home. Clouds can add an interesting background, and can also provide a foreground when reflected on water. They also bring out subtle colors, textures, and shadows that might not be apparent in full sunlight. Try taking some long exposure shots to bring out the colors of the mountain and the surrounding landscape. An overcast day is also a great opportunity to experiment with black and white photography. If the sky is too drab, try focusing more on the mountain itself instead of the skyline. You could also experiment focusing on foreground details, such as a lake or trees in front of the mountain."

Check the weather forecast for that day to anticipate any conditions, like overcast skies, that can affect lighting. If you're going on a hike, try to get a sense of how long it will take. If you want to shoot a particular mountain at sunset, for example, see how long it will take you to reach that mountain. This way, you can time your hike accordingly."

          "headline":"Opt for unusual mountains.",
          "description":"Do not take the same pictures everyone else takes. Lots of people shoot big landscapes or popular peaks in a particular range. Try to look for unique imagery. For example, focus your photo on something interesting in the foreground, like a plant, and use that to demonstrate the size of the mountain. Before going to a mountain range, look for amateur photos taken of the range online. You can find these on places like Flickr and Instagram. These will allow you to see what peaks, ranges, and angles have already been extensively photographed."

You don't have to get those proportions exactly right in every picture\u2014experiment with setting up your shot that way and then trying variants. For a more complex composition, try following the Rule of Nines. Imagine dividing your photo up into a 9 by 9 grid, with interesting features balanced across the grid in each \u201cbox\u201d (e.g., the sun in the upper right corner, the summit of the mountain in the upper left, a hiker on the bottom right, and a lake visible between the peaks in the middle)."

It can form a dramatic backdrop for close-ups and detail shots of anything from an interesting rock outcrop to a fellow hiker or climber. Experiment with taking snaps of someone or something in the extreme foreground, with the mountain looming behind. Try using a low-value f-stop (e.g., 4-8) to focus on the foreground detail and leave the mountain more blurred, or use a higher value (like 22) if you want to keep everything in focus."
