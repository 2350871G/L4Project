Your eyebrows look good on you. Allow about 20 to 30 minutes to burn off the lighter fluid and get the coals evenly burning. When the briquettes are covered with a layer of ash and glowing, they're ready. Pour them into the bottom of the grill, cover, and let it heat up. Consider using hardwood charcoal instead of the standard charcoal briquette. It adds a great smoky flavor that marries well with hot dogs."
