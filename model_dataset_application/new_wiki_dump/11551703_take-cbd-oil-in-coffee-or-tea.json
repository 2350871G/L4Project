Use your normal dose of CBD oil. Check that your CBD oil only contains edible ingredients, such as coconut oil and CBD oil. The label should clearly state that the oil is edible.Tip: If you\u2019re new to CBD oil, start with a dose of 10 mg and see how it affects you.

Use a spoon to mix the tincture into your drink. A tincture may mix into your coffee or tea more easily than a pure oil, since oil will float. Choose an unflavored tincture if you want to maintain the flavor of your coffee or tea. If you prefer to add flavoring, choose a tincture that tastes good to you. For instance, a French vanilla flavored tincture might taste great."

Use a measuring spoon to add the honey to your tea, then stir the tea to mix the ingredients. This lightly sweetens your drink while providing the benefits of CBD oil. You can purchase CBD-infused honey online. You may also find it at some health food stores or farmers markets."

If you prefer to use milk, add about .25 to .5 cups (59 to 118 mL) of whole milk to your coffee or tea. Otherwise, use about 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of coconut oil or organic butter. The milk, coconut oil, or butter will make coffee taste like a latte, and they\u2019ll thicken your tea."

To blend your drink well, use a spoon to stir your drink for about 30 seconds. Then, drink it immediately so the ingredients don\u2019t separate again. If you notice the oil on the top of the drink, stir it again to mix the oil back into your coffee or tea."
