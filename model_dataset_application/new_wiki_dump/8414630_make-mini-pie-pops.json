Place the diced apples into a mixing bowl along with 4 tablespoons of brown sugar, 4 tablespoons of white sugar, 2 tablespoons of flour, and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. If you want the apple pieces even smaller, consider grating the apples using a box or cheese grater."

Stir in 2/3 cup (100 g) of chopped pecans and 2/3 cup (115 g) of miniature semisweet chocolate chips. While you could use regular-sized chocolate chips, mini chocolate chips are easier to handle when you're assembling the pie pops."

Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface and lay the pastry down. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough to 1/4-inch (6 mm) thick. Turn on the oven to 350 degrees F (175 C). You can roll the dough into any shape since you'll be cutting it out. For example, you can roll the dough into a rectangle, if it's easier."

Lay parchment paper on two baking sheets and place half of the cutouts on the sheets. You can use any shape of cookie cutter that you like. Keep in mind that detailed shapes (like frilled stars) may be difficult to seal which could cause the filling to leak out."

Ensure that the stick is halfway across the cutout and press down just a little. Depending on which filling you use, place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of the cutouts. Don't spread the filling across the entire cutout or it will be difficult to seal the pastry lid."

If you'd like to make a decorative window, just use a miniature cookie cutter to cut the center out of each lid. Discard the tiny pastry shape and set the cutout lid over a filled cutout on your baking sheet. Gently press around the edges to seal the lids. You can use an extra lollipop stick or the tines of a fork to press into the edges. This will make a decorative border along the edges."

Dip a pastry brush into the egg white and brush it over each mini pie pop. Sprinkle the tops with a little demerara or coarse sugar. You can also use colored or decorative sugars for a bright touch."

Don't worry if the filling oozes out a little. This might just make them stick to the parchment a little. Let the pops cool completely before you handle or serve them. The filling will be very hot, so use caution."
