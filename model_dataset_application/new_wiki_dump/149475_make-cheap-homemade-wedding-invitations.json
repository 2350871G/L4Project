Think about your color scheme, the theme if you have one, and your own personal taste. Use that to decide whether you want to include pictures, a border, or any other graphics.For example, if you\u2019re having a beach wedding, you might include a line drawing of a seashell on your invitation. If your wedding will be very traditional and classic, a scrolled border is an elegant touch. If you're using an image, make sure they're high-resolution, or at least 300 DPI.

When you're designing the layout on the computer, just leave a blank space where you plan to attach the object. However, keep in mind that each added element will increase the total weight when postage is calculated.For example, if you find a pretty ribbon that matches your color scheme, use it to tie the invitation, RSVP card, and return envelope together. A strip of lace across the bottom of the page is a romantic, pretty addition to a wedding invitation."

You can find a stamp you like at a craft store, or you can order a personalized stamp online. Leave an empty space in the design of the invitation before you print it. Then, roll or press the stamp onto an ink pad and carefully press it straight down onto the paper to leave the design.For a wedding with a woodland theme, a pretty bird stamp is a perfect touch. Opt for a stamp with the married couple\u2019s monogram for a decorative element that you can use throughout the years! You can use colored pencils or markers to add a little color to the stamp if you want. Just do a test to make sure whatever you choose won't bleed through your paper!"

For instance, you could use a punch to make a scalloped edge along the top of the invitation, or you could cut a lace-like design all the way around the page. This is a low-cost way to add a special touch!Only stamp a few invitations at a time. If you start to get tired or bored, you might not cut the design evenly. If you're planning to punch around the edges of your invitation, remember to leave a wide enough margin, so you don't cut into your design!"

However, to ensure you get a good-quality font, check that the spacing between the letters, called the kerning, is even.Some popular free cursive fonts include Coneria Script, Candlescript, and Pinyon Script. If the font you choose is hard to read, you may want to use it for just the couple\u2019s names. Then, opt for a serif font for the rest of the invitation, like Forum, Playfair Display, or the classic Times New Roman. Serif fonts have small lines on the edges of the letters, and they tend to look more traditional."

          "description":"If your wedding style is rustic-chic or come-as-you-are, you probably want your font to be as fun and laid-back as you are, while still remaining elegant, of course. Play around with distressed fonts, different-sized letters, or fun embellishments to make your invitation unique.Good options for free fonts for you might include Bergamot Ornaments, Simon Script, or Shorelines Script."

It could also say something like \u201cJames Cryer and Taylor Paille, together with their families, cordially invite you.\u201d\nYou could also leave the host line out, if you\u2019re not sure what to put there."

While it used to be traditional for the bride\u2019s name to come first, changing social norms have made it acceptable for you to list the names in whatever order you prefer.If you want to, you can put the names of the couple in a different font than the rest of the wording. This will help draw even more attention to the names. You can mix sans serif and serif fonts if you like, or you can use a similar style if you'd prefer. Just make sure the 2 fonts you choose look nice together and are easy to read."

For instance, an action line that says \u201cJoin us for a fun celebration!\u201d lets the reader know that the ceremony will probably be more relaxed. \"We request the honor of your presence\" indicates the wedding will be held at a place of worship."

If there will be a gap between the ceremony and the reception, or if the reception will be at a different location, be sure to include that information, too.Often, the year is omitted when writing the date on an invitation, but you can include it if you'd like. Include any RVSP information, as well, including the deadline for RSVPs, who to contact, and how to respond. For instance, an email or a phone call might be fine to RSVP to a smaller wedding, but if you're hosting a large wedding, you might prefer all RSVPs come through the mail so you can keep track of them."

Just break the job into batches, and check each batch before you start a new one.An easy way to check on your printer is to compare the first and last copies from each batch with the very first copy from the first batch. If they all look identical, your printer is functioning the same. If the ink is starting to fade, you may need to replace the cartridge. You can buy these at an office supply store.

However, keep in mind that each added element will increase the total weight when postage is calculated.For example, if you find a pretty ribbon that matches your color scheme, use it to tie the invitation, RSVP card, and return envelope together. A strip of lace across the bottom of the page is a romantic, pretty addition to a wedding invitation. Use a stamp for an inexpensive way to add a design. Rubber stamps are a great way to add a special touch to a large number of invitations. You can find a stamp you like at a craft store, or you can order a personalized stamp online. Leave an empty space in the design of the invitation before you print it. Then, roll or press the stamp onto an ink pad and carefully press it straight down onto the paper to leave the design.For a wedding with a woodland theme, a pretty bird stamp is a perfect touch. Opt for a stamp with the married couple\u2019s monogram for a decorative element that you can use throughout the years! You can use colored pencils or markers to add a little color to the stamp if you want. Just do a test to make sure whatever you choose won't bleed through your paper! Use a punch or a stamp cutter to add pretty edges to the paper. You can find a variety of paper punches at a craft store. You can use these to add a unique design around the edges of your invitation. For instance, you could use a punch to make a scalloped edge along the top of the invitation, or you could cut a lace-like design all the way around the page. This is a low-cost way to add a special touch!Only stamp a few invitations at a time. If you start to get tired or bored, you might not cut the design evenly. If you're planning to punch around the edges of your invitation, remember to leave a wide enough margin, so you don't cut into your design! Choosing the Wording and Typography Choose a cursive font for a classic, romantic look. If you\u2019re having a formal, traditional wedding, there\u2019s nothing prettier than a scrolled, cursive typeface. You can find free fonts by searching online. However, to ensure you get a good-quality font, check that the spacing between the letters, called the kerning, is even.Some popular free cursive fonts include Coneria Script, Candlescript, and Pinyon Script. If the font you choose is hard to read, you may want to use it for just the couple\u2019s names. Then, opt for a serif font for the rest of the invitation, like Forum, Playfair Display, or the classic Times New Roman. Serif fonts have small lines on the edges of the letters, and they tend to look more traditional. Use a playful font for a relaxed wedding. If your wedding style is rustic-chic or come-as-you-are, you probably want your font to be as fun and laid-back as you are, while still remaining elegant, of course. Play around with distressed fonts, different-sized letters, or fun embellishments to make your invitation unique.Good options for free fonts for you might include Bergamot Ornaments, Simon Script, or Shorelines Script. Opt for a sans serif font for a modern look. Sans serif fonts have clean lines, without the lines at the tops and bottoms of the letters. If your style is modern and urban, a sans serif font is probably the best option for you.Free options for sans serif fonts include Montserrat Light, Josefin Sans, Ostrich Sans, and LemonChicken. Center your wording for the most elegant look. Typically, having the lettering justified to the center of your invitation will make it look the most professional. Also, try to make sure the text portion of your invitation is spaced evenly from the top to the bottom.There are no hard-and-fast rules for designing your own wedding invitation. If you decide your wording looks better right- or left-justified, go for it! Include the names of the hosts at the top of the invitation. Sometimes a wedding is hosted by one set of parents, sometimes both sets of parents, or sometimes the couple. Depending on your personal situation, you may choose to include an acknowledgment of the hosts, called the \u201cHost Line.\u201d It typically comes at the top of the invitation.The wording for the host line may say something like \u201cMr. & Mrs. Joseph Billings invite you to celebrate the wedding of their daughter,\u201d for instance. It could also say something like \u201cJames Cryer and Taylor Paille, together with their families, cordially invite you.\u201d\nYou could also leave the host line out, if you\u2019re not sure what to put there. Emphasize the names of the wedding couple by making them bigger. Typically, the names of the couple are larger than the rest of the font on the page. While it used to be traditional for the bride\u2019s name to come first, changing social norms have made it acceptable for you to list the names in whatever order you prefer.If you want to, you can put the names of the couple in a different font than the rest of the wording. This will help draw even more attention to the names. You can mix sans serif and serif fonts if you like, or you can use a similar style if you'd prefer. Just make sure the 2 fonts you choose look nice together and are easy to read. Include an invitation or action line. An action line is where you actually invite the reader to join you at the ceremony. The wording for the action is flexible, and can include options like, \u201cYou\u2019re Invited,\u201d \u201cPlease join us,\u201d or \u201cWe invite you to celebrate with us.\u201dYou can use the action line to indicate the formality of the wedding, if you like. For instance, an action line that says \u201cJoin us for a fun celebration!\u201d lets the reader know that the ceremony will probably be more relaxed. \"We request the honor of your presence\" indicates the wedding will be held at a place of worship. Make sure to include any relevant information. Your invitation should clearly state the location of the wedding, including the address, along with the time and date. If there will be a gap between the ceremony and the reception, or if the reception will be at a different location, be sure to include that information, too.Often, the year is omitted when writing the date on an invitation, but you can include it if you'd like. Include any RVSP information, as well, including the deadline for RSVPs, who to contact, and how to respond. For instance, an email or a phone call might be fine to RSVP to a smaller wedding, but if you're hosting a large wedding, you might prefer all RSVPs come through the mail so you can keep track of them. Finish with a party line. The party line lets the reader know what will occur after the ceremony. For instance, if you\u2019re having a reception with music, food, and dancing, you might have a line at the invitation that says, \"Dinner and dancing to follow\" or \"Reception to follow.\" Printing the Invitations Start by printing a test copy on printer paper. Before you print your invitation on your good cardstock, it\u2019s a good idea to print a single copy on regular printer paper. Check this test copy carefully to make sure everything\u2019s lined up correctly, there are no typos, and all of the information is accurate.You want your invitations to look as good as possible, so take your time double- and triple-checking your test copies\nFor extra peace of mind, have someone else proofread your invitation as well. If you're including 3D decorations, stamps, punches, or other elements that won't be printed onto the invitation, try them out on the test copy to make sure they fit properly, and make any needed adjustments if they don't. Test a single copy on your nice stationery to check the design a final time. Even after you\u2019re satisfied with the invitation on printer paper, print one single invitation on your cardstock for a final check. That way, if the ink appears different on the cardstock, or if there\u2019s a problem with your printer, you won\u2019t be stuck with a stack of invitations you can\u2019t use.Once you\u2019re satisfied with this copy, you can begin printing your invitations. Print the invitations in batches of 10-20. It\u2019s best to print your invitations in small batches, in case you need to change the ink cartridge or the printer head alignment changes due to the heavy cardstock. Just break the job into batches, and check each batch before you start a new one.An easy way to check on your printer is to compare the first and last copies from each batch with the very first copy from the first batch. If they all look identical, your printer is functioning the same. If the ink is starting to fade, you may need to replace the cartridge. You can buy these at an office supply store. If the invitations aren\u2019t lined up correctly, you may need to realign the printer heads. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for your printer to do this. Take the file to a professional print shop if you don't have a good printer. If you\u2019re not sure that your printer will be able to handle the job, consider having the invitations professionally printed. You may find that the cost of doing this is less than what you would pay to replace your printer, especially if you\u2019re providing your own paper.Call around to get estimates so you can find the best deal. Order a proof if you want to use an online print shop. That way, you can see and feel a hard copy before you have the whole batch printed up. Addressing and Mailing the Envelopes Address the invitations by hand if you write neatly. If you know calligraphy or you just have nice handwriting, you can save money by addressing the invitations yourself. Use a good quality pen and sit in a comfortable chair at a desk or table. Gather your list of addresses, then carefully copy the names and addresses of your guests onto each envelope.If your handwriting is nice but you want to try something special, look online for free calligraphy tutorials! Just be sure to practice on plain paper before you start writing on the envelopes. Tip: Address your envelopes before you fill them. That way, you\u2019ll have a smooth surface to write on, and you won\u2019t leave a pen imprint on your invitation. Print your address labels if you don't have good handwriting. If you don\u2019t think your handwriting is very neat, or if you just want to save some time, you can print adhesive address labels, instead. Buy a pack of adhesive label paper from an office supply store, then use a word processor with a template for labels. Type one guest\u2019s name or family name and address on each label, then print out the whole sheet at once.Use a simple, easy-to-read font for these labels, so the invitations don't accidentally get sent to the wrong address! This is also a good option for including your return address. Just print out a whole sheet with your name and address, then attach them to the envelopes! Assemble the invitations. Once you have your invitations printed and your envelopes addressed, it\u2019s time to put everything together! Make sure each envelope contains every element, including the invitation, the RSVP card, travel information if you\u2019re including it, and the return envelope.This is usually a fun process, since you finally get to see all your work come together, so take your time and enjoy it! It\u2019s fine to seal the envelopes with the included adhesive, but you can also use stickers or a wax seal to close the tab if you want to add a nice finishing touch. Mail the invitations 6-8 weeks before the wedding. In order to give your guests plenty of time to RSVP, you should plan to send your invitations out about 2 months before your big day. Depending on the weight, a single stamp might not cover the cost of mailing the invitations. To make sure you have the postage correct, it\u2019s best to take your invitations to the post office to mail them.",
