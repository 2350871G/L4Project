If you want uniformity, small boxwood bushes are a great option. However, they do take their time to grow. Another option is to place large planters with bushes or tall grasses around your unit. This is a good choice if the soil around your AC isn\u2019t suitable for growing plants. An aromatic bushy plant, such as lavender lilac, is another great option."

Then, plant a number of hardy, climbing plants around the trellis base. You can even help them along by weaving some of the plant into the trellis\u2019 gaps. Wait for the plant to grow and it will fill in any remaining holes, leaving a natural barrier. You could choose a flowering plant, like honeysuckle, or something more common to a garden, such as beans. Trumpet vine, wisteria, or climbing hydrangea are other strong trellis plants."
