          "description":"The amount of CBD will be clearly labeled on the front of the package so you can easily find it. Check next to the number to see if it\u2019s the amount in the entire package or per serving. If you\u2019re trying CBD for the first time, choose an oil with less CBD so you can get used to how it affects your body. The amount of CBD in the package is not the same as the package size. Some CBD oils may be mislabeled and could contain more or less CBD. Research the CBD oil\u2019s manufacturer and pick one that lists accurate amounts."

          "description":"Look near the bottom of the label to find the total amount of oil in the package. Divide the amount of CBD by the size of the package so you know the oil\u2019s potency. Compare the potencies of multiple oils so you can choose one that works best for you. For example, if a 15 mL bottle contains 500 mg of CBD, then the equation would be 500/15 = 33.3 mg of CBD per mL. CBD oil affects everyone differently. While it may only take you 1 dose of oil for you to feel it, another person may need multiple doses or a higher potency to feel the same effect."

CBD oils usually have serving sizes of 0.5 or 1 mL, but it may vary depending on the product you\u2019re using. The label will also list how many servings are included in the package. Don\u2019t use more than the serving size listed until you know how CBD oil affects your body. Too much CBD can give you adverse reactions and make your conditions feel worse."

Look on the label near the amount of CBD or on the nutritional panel on the back of the package to find the amount of THC. Usually, high-quality CBD oils will have less than 0.3% THC and will not give you a high. If you can\u2019t find the amount of THC listed on the package, avoid getting the oil since it may be low-quality. Check the laws and regulations on CBD in your area since they may vary.Warning: If the CBD oil has over 0.6% THC, then you may be charged with possession of drugs if marijuana is illegal in your area."
