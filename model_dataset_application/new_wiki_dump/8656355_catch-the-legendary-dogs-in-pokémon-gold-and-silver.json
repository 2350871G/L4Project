  "text":" Preparing Get a Pok\u00e9mon who knows the Mean Look. The Legendary Dogs, though strong, prefer to run on the first chance they get. To prevent them from running, get a Pok\u00e9mon that knows the move Mean Look. This move prevents the foe from fleeing. Two best choices are: Gengar (learns at level 13) and Crobat (level 42). Get a sleep-inducing Pok\u00e9mon to put the dog to sleep. This makes catching them easier. Stock up on Ultra Balls (at least 30+ for one dog).  Stock up on Max Repels.  Finding the Dogs Start the search near a place where you can easily change locations and there is tall grass nearby. Keep in mind the dogs change their position when you enter/exit through a door or use fly to change location. The best preferred  location is Route 38 where you can easily switch location by passing through the western gate of Ecruteak City. Keep your mean look using Pok\u00e9mon at front of your Pok\u00e9mon party (below level 40). Use Max Repel. Enter the grass and roam for around 15-20 seconds. Change position if needed. If no dog shows up, then change location by passing through the door. This will change the locations of the dogs. Come back to Route 38 and start searching in the grass with your Max Repel on. Track them. If you encounter the dogs even once, you can track them using your Pok\u00e9dex. Just go to the Pok\u00e9mon entry in your Pok\u00e9dex and select Area. Catching the Dogs Keep your Mean Look Pok\u00e9mon in front of your party. It will be sent out when you encounter the dog. Use Mean Look right away to prevent the Pok\u00e9mon from running. Damage the Pok\u00e9mon a little bit: Use your sleep inducing Pok\u00e9mon to put it to sleep. Start using your Pok\u00e9mon to attack it using weaker moves.
