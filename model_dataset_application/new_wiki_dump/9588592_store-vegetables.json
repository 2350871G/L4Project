          "description":"Cut the green tops off of carrots, radishes, beets, and celery, then place them in a container full of cold water until they\u2019re just submerged. Leave the container on one of the central shelves in the refrigerator uncovered. When properly stored, the tough, fibrous veggies will keep for up to 2 weeks. Changing the water every 2-3 days will help prevent them from becoming slimy. A shallow water bath will prevent the tough veggies from drying out when exposed to the cold air in the refrigerator. Hold onto your beet and carrot greens\u2014they can be saut\u00e9d and served as a scrumptious side dish."

          "description":"Keep crunchy broccoli, bok choy, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts in the bag you bought them in or transfer them to another open container and put them away as-is. The crisper drawer is the best place for these items, as they do best in conditions that are cool but not bone-dry. If you\u2019re worried about them drying out, lay a damp paper towel over the tops of the heads or leaves."

        {
          "headline":"Store lettuce and cabbage dry.",
          "description":"After rinsing the head with cold water, pat it dry thoroughly, then return it to its original bag and tie off the top. You can also put it in a separate large airtight container with a locking lid. The container can then go anywhere in the refrigerator that you have room. The same can be done for whole radicchio, as well. The more moisture present, the more likely the head is to turn brown and mushy."

          "headline":"Wrap leafy greens in a damp paper towel.",
          "description":"Wet a layer of 2-3 folded paper towels under a cold tap, then squeeze out the excess water. Unfurl the paper towels and place the greens inside. Fold the edges over to cover them, then stick the entire bundle in a bowl or open container and place it in the fridge. This method works well for items like spinach, arugula, kale, basil, and pre-cut Romaine lettuce, as well as fresh herbs. If you don\u2019t have an extra container to spare, slip a rubber band loosely around the bundle to hold it together."

          "headline":"Refrigerate bell peppers, cucumbers, and zucchini after a few days.",
          "description":"These will typically be fine on the countertop for 2-3 days. After that, they can begin to wrinkle and grow soft. At this point, you\u2019ll need to wrap them in a damp paper towel or place them in an open plastic bag and move them to your refrigerator\u2019s crisper drawer. Crisp, juicy vegetables with tough skins don\u2019t tend to last longer than about 2 days at room temperature. A trip to the fridge may buy them an additional 2-3 days at most."

          "description":"Keeping fresh produce in close proximity can cause it to spoil faster. For this reason, it's generally best to do away with plastic bags and boxes that can smother fresh vegetables and instead store them loose. If you're working with limited storage space, you can also use a large open container that promotes airflow, like a cardboard box or reusable mesh bag."

Assuming you\u2019ve run out of other storage options, try dumping them into a bucket or basket and tucking them away in one of the bottom corners of your pantry. A dim basement or earthen cellar can be ideal for potatoes. The same guidelines apply to sweet potatoes, turnips, and rutabaga."

For most varieties, you\u2019ll have 2-5 days to use them before they begin to show signs of going bad. If you buy them ripe, try to use them either the same day or the next. If for some reason you can\u2019t enjoy your produce right away, place it in an open plastic or paper bag and stick it in the refrigerator, where it will keep for another 2-3 days."

As a result, they don\u2019t require any special treatment. Moving older bulbs to the crisper drawer or a cool, dark shelf in an out-of-the-way part of your pantry may buy them a little more time. Throw out unused onions and garlic once they grow limp and discolored or start to develop an overpowering sour smell."

          "description":"As their classification suggests, hearty seasonal varieties of squash like butternut, kabocha, and sweet dumpling prefer cold temperatures. A dark pantry or kitchen cabinet is often a perfect place for them. You can even leave smaller specimens like acorn squash in the fridge for longer-term storage, if space allows. You may even be able to get away with stashing recently-harvested winter squash outside, as long as the temperature doesn\u2019t fluctuate too much above or below about 50. The same storage advice also applies to pretty much all major species of pumpkins. Winter squashes can keep anywhere from 4 weeks to 7 months, depending on the size and species."

Keep your avocados somewhere in plain sight where you can track their status. To test whether they\u2019re ready to eat, give them a gentle squeeze. They should feel soft and pliable, but not mushy. If your avocados have already ripened and you haven\u2019t yet used them, relocate them to the refrigerator to keep them alive for 3-5 more days."
