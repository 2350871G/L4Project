Modern vaseline glass can be clear or blue as well. Its oily sheen is part of the reason why it is named vaseline glass, because petroleum jelly has a slightly oily sheen as well."

If the glass has a date stamped on it anywhere and it is between 1850 and 1880, there is a good chance that it is vaseline glass.
