  "text":" Prepare the Dough Whisk the flour, kosher salt and baking soda together in a bowl.  Combine the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl. Beat the butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or a handheld mixer. The mixer should be set on medium speed. Add 1 egg and mix for 30 additional seconds.  Add the second egg and mix for a little longer before adding the vanilla.  Scoop 1 cup of the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix until they are well incorporated.  Continue adding the dry ingredients in 1-cup increments until they have been mixed into the wet ingredients. This keeps the dough moist and doesn\u2019t allow it to become elastic. Dump the dough out onto a floured work surface and shape it into a disc.  Wrap the disc in plastic wrap and chill the dough for 30 minutes.  Bake the Cookies Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Pour a small layer of granulated sugar onto a plate.  Shape the dough into 1\" (2.5 centimeter) balls using your clean hands.  Roll each ball of dough in the granulated sugar.  Place the balls of dough onto the baking sheet, leaving about 1\" (2.5 centimeters) of space between the cookies.  Bake the cookies for 10 minutes or until they just turn golden brown around the edges. Remove them from the oven and allow them to rest for 2 minutes on the stovetop. Loosen the cookies from the parchment paper with a spatula and place them on wire racks to cool completely.  Place the cooled cookies in a plastic resealable bag and refrigerate them for 4 hours or overnight.  Batter and Fry the Cookies Fill a Dutch oven about halfway full of vegetable or canola oil.  Heat the oil over medium high heat until it reaches 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Measure the temperature with a candy thermometer for the best accuracy. Mix the pancake mix and cold water in a bowl with a whisk while the oil is heating.  Remove the cookies from the refrigerator. Dip each cookie in the pancake mix, making a thin coating of batter on each cookie. Carefully lower the cookie into the hot oil using tongs.  Fry each cookie until it is golden brown, which should take approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  Place the fried sugar cookies on a platter that has been covered in paper towels to absorb the excess oil.  Dust the cookies with confectioner\u2019s sugar and serve them while they\u2019re hot.  Finished. ",
