You can use a carved out watermelon or pumpkin, a flower vase, a planter, or a bowl. Choose a holder that\u2019s appropriate to the size and shape you want your arrangement to be. Other supplies you'll need include:\nA good sharp knife and cutting board\nFloral foam (alternatively, use a head of cabbage or lettuce)\nBamboo skewers and toothpicks\nFlower-shaped metal cookie cutters\nAluminum foil and plastic wrap\nA melon baller"

Of the common fruits that are used, you can make a basic arrangement with one:\nPineapple\nCantaloupe and one honeydew\nQuart of strawberries\nPint each of blueberries and blackberries\nBag seedless grapes\nBunch of kale or another large, leafy green"

Peel the honeydew. Place the melon halves flat-side down on a flat surface. Follow the rounded contour of the melons with a knife to remove the rind. Cut each melon half into crescent-shaped wedges that are about an inch thick on the bottom. Cut the wedges in half widthwise. These will be used as flower leaves."

Without peeling it, slice the remaining pineapple into rounds that are half an inch to three-quarters of an inch thick. Use the cookie cutters to press out the center of each pineapple slice into flower shapes. You can use different sizes and shapes, or you can make each flower-shaped pineapple piece the same. You can also use other shapes for the pineapples, such as hearts (great for Valentine\u2019s Day) stars, or even holiday-themed shapes."

          "description":"Fill the bowl with floral foam. Cut the foam to fit if necessary. Cover the foam in a layer of foil, tucking the foil inside the bowl to cover the sides of the foam. This will prevent pieces of foam from getting on the fruit. Then, lay some kale over top to cover the foil. Position the kale so the leaves spill out over the sides of the bowl. A head of cabbage will also work as a base into which you can place your fruit skewers. Put it in your bowl and cut it to size if necessary. Lay kale over it and position the leaves to overhang the top of the bowl. The overhanging kale will create a nice green base for the arrangement, and make it look a little more like a traditional flower arrangement."

Skewer a melon wedge so it sticks out perpendicular to the skewer with the crescent facing the ceiling. Skewer the second wedge in the same fashion but on the other side, and with the crescent facing the floor. Insert the top of the skewer through the bottom of the pineapple flower and insert it about halfway into the pineapple flower. Make sure the flower is vertical, with the flower head facing outward, not the ceiling. Position the two melon wedges so they are about an inch below the bottom of the pineapple, like leaves on a flower stem. Repeat until all the pineapple flowers have been put on stems and given melon leaves.
