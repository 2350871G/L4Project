          "description":"There\u2019s nothing that can fill your home with the scent of fall quite as well as a well-crafted simmer pot. Use aromatic herbs, spices, and fruit to create exactly the aroma - and atmosphere - you\u2019re hoping for. For instance, mix 1 quart of water, 4 bay leaves, 1 thinly-sliced orange, a sprig of fresh rosemary, and a vanilla bean in a saucepan. Heat the concoction on medium high until it begins to simmer, and lower the heat so that it\u2019s just hot enough to keep simmering. If you want the simmer pot to last more than 15-20 minutes, you\u2019ll likely have to add a bit of water periodically. Use 1 or two teaspoons instead of a vanilla bean, if necessary. If you do use a vanilla bean, you can dry it out and reuse it a few times. If you want to keep a simmer pot going for more than an hour or two, use a crock pot. After achieving a simmer with a higher heat, reduce the crock pot\u2019s heat to low. Other great ingredients to include in a fall-themed simmer pot are sliced apples, cinnamon sticks, dry star anise, fresh or dry ginger, cardamom pods, coves, and/or dried orange peel."

Of course, there are a handful of equally enjoyable fall dishes, especially desserts, that will smell so good you\u2019ll end up hungry. Anything with cinnamon, apple, and vanilla will smell especially seasonally appropriate. Don\u2019t forget about pumpkin pie or pumpkin bread. In fact, baking with anything that has cloves, nutmeg, will fill your home with familiar fall scents as well."

Pumpkin spice cookies are another good option, and contain plenty of particularly potent fall aromatics, such as cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg."

          "description":"Candied apples will not only bring the scent of fall to mind, it may bring back childhood fall memories as well. To make your own caramel coating, cook 1 cup butter, 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup light corn syrup, and 14 ounces of sweetened condensed milk on a stove at medium-high. Stirring non-stop, turn the heat down when the caramel boils, and use a candy thermometer to maintain a temperature of 250\u00b0 F (120\u00b0 C) for roughly 30 minutes. To test whether the coating is ready, drop a teaspoon into cold water. It should form a hard ball of caramel if it\u2019s ready. Add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract once cooking is complete. Carefully dip apples previously pierced with craft sticks into the caramel. Allow them to cool on wax paper, but not before adorning with your favorite toppings, such as pecans or crushed pumpkin cookies. If you struggling to choose between desserts, just bake caramel apple flavored cookies."

          "headline":"Make your own fall-scented candles.",
          "description":"For a sustained, powerful aroma, make a custom candle. Choose a mason jar or other fire safe container. Go to a craft supplies store for some smokeless candle wicks and flaked soy wax, and make sure your kitchen is stocked with a tablespoon of vanilla extract, another of cinnamon, and \u00bd a tablespoon of ground clove. Use a microwave and start melting your wax by heating one cup on high for two minutes. Once the first cup is melted, add a bit of wax in one minute increments until you have sufficient melted wax for the container that will hold your candle. If you\u2019re using a standard mason jar, you\u2019ll need two cups of wax overall. Once the wax is melted, add the vanilla and spices. Mix well, ideally by stirring with a disposable skewer. Wrap the end of a candle wick that will be exposed around a thin item that can bridge the opening of your candle\u2019s container. Allow the metal-tipped end to dangle to the bottom of the container. Pour the melted wax into the candle container while adjusting the wick to keep it in the center of the wax. Allow the candle to sit at room temperature for at least 4 hours to set."

          "description":"You can make a spray that can instantly fill a room with the fall scent of your choosing. For an especially woodsy  option, start with 3 tablespoons of either vodka, ethyl alcohol, or witch hazel. Add 10 drops each of the following oils; juniper, sage, bergamot, and cinnamon. Add these ingredients to an 8-ounce spray bottle and fill the bottle the rest of the way with water. Always shake the bottle well before using. For a similar option, but sweeter-smelling option, go with 10 drops each of cedar wood, rosemary, orange, and clove oils instead. Avoid spraying your aromatic mist on anyone\u2019s skin, or in front of anyone\u2019s face."

          "description":"If you have an essential oil diffuser, there are several great blends you can make to produce fall aromas. For example, use 3 drops of cardamom and 1 drop each of clove, cassia, and ginger essential oils to make a spiced Chai-inspired scent. For a more cool-walk-in-the-woods approach, use 3 drops of eucalyptus, 2 drops of juniper berry, and a single drop of sage essential oil. To get the scent of apple pie emanating from your diffuser, add 2 drops each of clove, ginger, and cinnamon bark oils. Add a drop of nutmeg too, for an even sweeter aroma. While classic cone or stick  incense can provide fall-inspired aromas as well, essential oils are safer, healthier, and will better disperse aroma in your home."

Homemade options are usually preferable to store bought blends, as you can customize not only a specific scent, but a particular level of potency. Go with larger portions of larger items, and smaller amounts of the more potent (and usually more colorful) ingredients. Large items that are great to make up the majority of a potpourri include pine cones, dried apples and oranges, cinnamon sticks, and nuts. Good small, aromatic ingredients include cloves, rose hips, juniper berries, and bay leaves. After selecting your ingredients, place them all in a large jar or bowl and gently toss them.
