Tighten the two ends. Pulling the two ends apart will help secure your knot. Pull the long end away from you and the short end toward you. Repeat the above steps if you want or need to tie a second square knot. Mastering the Instrument Tie Position a pair of forceps perpendicular to the string.

These instructions are for right-handed readers. Use your left hand to loop the long end of the string around the forceps. Pinch the long end of the string with your left-hand thumb and index finger. Then, take it up and away from you, and over the forceps. Grasp the tip of the short end with the forceps. With the long end of the string looped around the forceps, rotate the forceps away from you and toward the short end. Make sure you grasp the short end tightly with the forceps. Continue to hold onto the long end with your left hand during this step. Pull the short end through the loop around your forceps.

Grab the tip of the short end with your forceps. With the long end looped around your forceps, rotate the forceps toward the short end. After grabbing the short end, bring it up and toward the loop around your forceps. Bring the short end through the loop around your forceps to finish. Once you pull the short end through the loop, tighten the knot by pulling the two ends away from each other. When you\u2019ve tightened this knot, repeat all these steps to tie another knot, or let go of the short end with your forceps to finish.",
