Heating the garment beyond recommended settings may cause damage to the material. Some materials, such as polyester, may actually melt if overheated. Use a hairdryer to heat the transfer. A hairdryer on its hottest setting, held very close to the letters, may heat the adhesive on the back of the transfer enough for it to become malleable and be removed. Use steam to heat the transfer. Alternately, you can use steam to treat the transfer. Place a wet towel over the transfer and put a very hot iron on top of it.
