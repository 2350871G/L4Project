          "description":"Your window covering shouldn\u2019t be taut when it\u2019s closed, so you want something wider than the actual width of your window. For example, if your window is 36 inches (91 cm) wide, look for a window treatment that\u2019s 72 to 90 inches (180 to 230 cm) wide. An exception is if your window treatment is just going to frame the window. Then you won\u2019t need to worry about the width."

          "headline":"Determine the length by measuring from the floor to the rod.",
          "description":"Mark where you're going to hang the curtain rod. Use a measuring tape to get your length and round up to the nearest inch. It\u2019s better to have longer curtains than too-short ones, which look awkward. Curtains that graze the floor are best if you\u2019re opening and closing the curtains a lot. Going with a curtain length that\u2019s up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) longer than your measurement so the curtains spill onto the floor is very trendy. If floor-length curtains don\u2019t make sense in the space, like in a bathroom, measure from the bottom of the windowsill to where the rod will be hung."

        {
          "headline":"Order custom panels if your windows aren\u2019t a standard size.",
          "description":"Ready-to-hang curtain panels typically range in length from 63 to 144 inches (160 to 370 cm). If you can\u2019t find window treatments that fit your width or length, have them custom-made from a fabric store, home store, or online retailer. Another option is to get curtains that are longer than you\u2019d like and then either hem them yourself or take them to a seamstress. Custom curtains will be more expensive and cannot be returned so be sure about your decision before you order them."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose curtains that match or complement the room\u2019s color scheme.",
          "description":"Picking a color that contrasts with the wall is usually a good choice. For example, if you have dark walls, go with lighter curtains in a cream or pastel shade. And if you have a white wall, curtains in a bold hue that play into the rest of the room will stand out. Neutral colors like earth tones, grays, or whites are best if you don\u2019t want to draw attention to the window treatments. Avoid hanging curtains in deep colors like violet or royal blue in a bright room. Sunlight will fade the hue over time."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Opt for patterned curtains if you want them to be a focal point.",
          "description":"Whether you choose a vibrant abstract print, a Greek key pattern, or a delicate floral, patterned curtains make a stylish statement in any space. Look for patterns that pick up the colors in the room to create a cohesive feel. For a more subdued effect, choose a smaller print like a narrow stripe or tiny dots. Don\u2019t be afraid to mix patterns, as long as they balance each other. For instance, if you have a bold paisley rug, complement it with curtains in a simple chevron print."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Match the material to the mood of the room.",
          "description":"Fabric and texture are 2 key factors in picking out curtains. They should go with the style of your decor. Ruffled or sheer curtains are more feminine and whimsical, while linen, cotton, or a cotton blend are casual and classic. For a formal space, you might go with crushed velvet or heavy silk. Bamboo or natural woven curtains add a bohemian effect and warm up a space. Tips for Choosing Curtain Fabric\nAre you hanging the curtains in a small room? Pick a sheer fabric like gauze or chiffon to let the most light in and brighten up the space. Do you want a fabric that's low maintenance? Avoid silk. Stick to materials that are easy to clean like cotton or polyester. Are the curtains for the bedroom? If so, either use blackout curtains to keep the room dark for sleeping or pick heavy material that blocks out most light like velvet or tapestry. Will the curtains be in direct sunlight? Brocade or canvas materials stand up best to the sun's rays."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pick the heading style based on how often you\u2019ll open the curtains.",
          "description":"The heading of the curtains is what you hang on the rod. Hooks are the most traditional style and the easiest to open. They\u2019re best if you\u2019re going to be opening and closing the curtains often. Curtains with grommets are also a good option. Rod-pocket curtains are some of the most common. They have a fabric pocket that the rod slides into. These are not meant to be opened and closed, though. Tabs are very casual. These also come in ties, which can be tied in bows for a girly look."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose a rod to match the metal in the rest of the room.",
          "description":"The hardware that you use to mount the rod to the wall should match as well. For example, if your living room has gold accents, choose a gold-hued curtain rod. This also applies to wooden rods. If your furniture is a deep mahogany, don\u2019t choose a pale natural rod. If you can't find a rod that exactly matches, look for one that has similar tones or hues to the rest of the room."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pick a rod that extends 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) beyond the window.",
          "description":"A rod that is wider than the window makes the window look bigger. It also gives you room on each side to push the curtains open to frame the window. For extra wide windows, look for extra long rods that have an extendable piece. Rods that are too short also block light."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Hang the rod halfway between the top of the window and the ceiling.",
          "description":"Avoid hanging the rod directly above or on top of the window frame. This makes the room feel smaller. Instead, place it at least half the distance between the frame and the edge of the ceiling to open up the space. The closer you hang the curtains to the ceiling, the better it will look. Just leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the rod and the ceiling for the heading of the curtain. For a perfectly placed rod, use a level when you're hanging it so it's not crooked."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use tiebacks for an elegant feel or if your window has a pretty view.",
          "description":"Sweeping the window treatment to the side with a tieback not only adds a glamorous vibe, it shows off what\u2019s outside the window and lets sunlight in. Use tassels or a metal rosette for a sophisticated style or opt for ribbon or twine for something more casual. If you use a metal tieback, it should match the rest of the metal in the room just like the rod does."

          "description":"If your window is above the bathtub or near a heater, window treatments that go all the way to the floor won\u2019t work. Roman shades are an elegant alternative. They\u2019re timeless and can match any room or style. Plus, they\u2019re very easy to open and close, and keep clean. Pleated or constructed Romans have more structure and fold neatly when pulled up. Relaxed or butterfly Romans are more casual and hang loosely. If you can\u2019t find a Roman shade that you like, pick out the fabric of your choice and make your own."

        {
          "headline":"Drape a window scarf around the window for a whimsical, playful feel.",
          "description":"Soften up the edges of a harsh window by hanging a flowy window scarf over top of it. You can wrap it around a curtain rod or place a bracket or decorative finial above each corner of the window and drape the scarf over them. Lighter, sheer fabrics make the best scarves. Try arranging the scarf symmetrically for a cleaner look or slightly skewed or falling to one side for a gypsy style. Layer a sheer window scarf over curtains to add texture and visual appeal to a room."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a valance if you want to add a pretty accent with no function.",
          "description":"Valances don\u2019t actually block light or insulate a room since they\u2019re so short. They simply provide a pop of polish. Use them in a room like a living room, dining room, or kitchen where you don\u2019t necessarily need them to be functional. Valances come in all different fabrics, prints, and colors. Pick one that complements the style of the room. A wood valance made from natural or salvaged wood is perfect for a rustic chic home. Pair a valance with curtains or blinds if you\u2019d like extra window coverage."

        {
          "headline":"Apply window film to look like etched or stained glass.",
          "description":"Similar to window clings, window film sticks to your glass with a simple water and soap spray. You can get film that looks like ornate stained glass or frosted privacy glass. There\u2019s also film that makes the glass look like it\u2019s been etched in a decorative design. Window film also blocks the sun\u2019s UV rays from fading or damaging your furniture. Find window film at a home store, hardware store, or online retailer."

Not only do they look homey and welcoming to people outside, they also greatly improve the view from inside! Mix and match all of your favorite blooms and greens for a full, overflowing box. If you don\u2019t have a green thumb or if you live in a climate that\u2019s tough for growing plants, fill your boxes with succulents and cacti instead. Natural wood boxes look more rustic while colorful boxes are more playful. Paint your own to match your window trim or shutters if you have them."

          "headline":"Install shutters if you want a beach house or cottage vibe.",
          "description":"Traditional wood shutters can make any home look like it belongs in the English countryside or by the shore. They\u2019re an easy way to add instant curb appeal and can be painted to match any exterior. It's also a good option for playing around with colors without painting the entire house. For a classic look, keep the door color neutral and use a bright color on the shutters. Try an ombre effect by painting the shutters a slightly deeper shade than the rest of the house. Consider cut-outs in your shutters for extra personality. For example, a beach house might have starfish or sailboats."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Paint the window trim for a pop of color.",
          "description":"Add some visual interest to the outside of your home by painting a border around your windows in a contrasting color than the rest of the house. For example, on a light gray house, bright white or deep navy trim look classy and chic. For an edgy effect, outline your windows in a stand-out shade like a vibrant red or a bold blue. If you paint 1 window, paint them all. Otherwise, your house will look unfinished. Use a high-quality exterior paint. Paint that has a slight shine, like eggshell or satin finish, won\u2019t fade as fast as flat paint."

          "description":"Get in the Christmas spirit by outlining the border of your outside windows with strands of lights to look like a gingerbread house. Keep it classic with white lights or go more modern with multi-colored bulbs. Draping icicle lights underneath or above the window gives your house a whimsical winter wonderland vibe. For an extra festive touch, hang an evergreen wreath in the center of the window, too. The lights will illuminate it all night long."
