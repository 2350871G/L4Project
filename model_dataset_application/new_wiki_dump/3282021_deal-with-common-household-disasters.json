Either way, you\u2019ll need to control the urge to attack the cat\u2013 and aim for the carpet instead. Protect yourself with gloves.  Soak up what you can with paper towels.  Spray the area with a vinegar and water solution (or simply dab if you don\u2019t have a spray bottle).  Blot the area liberally with bicarbonate of soda and then spray with a laundry stain remover.  Allow the area to dry and vacuum well (several times over). You may need to brush the area to loosen dried bicarb. You may also want to take your cat to the vet; avoiding the litter tray is the first sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). A Wild Animal Has Gotten Inside Stop panicking and put on some boots.

Take all weather related precautions, especially if you are caring for children or the elderly.  Red Wine on the Carpet Keep the area damp.  Blot the area with paper towel (or a clean cloth).  Add water (at room temperature) to the area to dilute as you blot.  Mix a quick solution of 1 tbsp dish soap, 1 tbsp white vinegar, and 2 cups of lukewarm water and pat the area until it\u2019s clean. - If you don\u2019t have vinegar on hand, or you can\u2019t attend to the spill immediately, liberally sprinkle salt over the area and spray with water occasionally until you can attend to it. Strangely enough, white wine will work in the place of water.  Blocked Toilet Stop flushing the toilet. Once should be enough for you to see the water level rising. Try to determine the cause of the blockage. If it\u2019s a child\u2019s toy or your cell phone, you\u2019ll need to go in there with your hands. If it is biological waste, or a paper clog, grab the nearest plunger.  Work slowly; frantic movements tend to make it worse.
