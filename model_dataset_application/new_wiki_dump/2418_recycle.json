Ask a neighbor or call your city's waste department to find out what days collection occur. If you don't have a recycling can, be sure to call your municipal waste department to talk over your options.

It is much easier to sort the recycling ahead of time instead of on trash day, so ask a neighbor or check online for your city's specific policy. If your city allows single-stream, you likely have only one can for trash. If your city requires sorting, you will likely need to have three separate cans for paper, plastic, glass, and metal."

Furthermore, all-plastic toys, coat hangers, waste baskets, and takeout trays can all be recycled too as long as they are clean. Styrofoam, a type of plastic, can also be recycled.
