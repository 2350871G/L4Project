Remove all outdated food, any food with unsuitable animal-derived products (ovo-lacto vegetarians can keep more foods than vegans), and remove anything that lacks labels but you aren't quite sure what it is. Wipe down all the shelves and allow to dry. Gelatin and meat/bone broths are considered not suitable for all vegetarians, not just vegans."

Only purchase small amounts at a time. It is handy to always have on hand walnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, cashews, pecans and sesame seeds. Peanuts are a personal choice given modern allergy problems. Nut and seed butters are also very useful to keep on hand; consider tahini, peanut butter, cashew nut butter, almond butter etc. Some require refrigeration on opening. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/63\\/Stock-a-Vegetarian-Pantry-Step-3Bullet10.jpg\\/v4-460px-Stock-a-Vegetarian-Pantry-Step-3Bullet10.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/63\\/Stock-a-Vegetarian-Pantry-Step-3Bullet10.jpg\\/v4-760px-Stock-a-Vegetarian-Pantry-Step-3Bullet10.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\n\nFlavourings: There are a number of key flavourings that no vegetarian pantry should be without.

Cheese sauce or cheese substitute sauces in packets; packet soups\nSeasoned vegetable salt (there are numerous good brands around)\n\nConcentrated liquid stock or flavouring derived from vegetable, herb and spice sources (a few drops will do each use)\nCurry powder\nSeasonings such as herbs, spices, salt, pepper etc. Dry your fresh herbs for seeing the winter through\nSeaweed products for seasoning, including dulse\nFlavoured vinegars, dressings\nSweeteners such as raw and organic sugar, stevia, rice syrup, agave syrup, honey, maple syrup, xylitol etc. Select whatever suits your needs, preferences, and dietary requirements. Have a few treats in store. It is useful to have some treats on stand-by for guests, children and the munchies. Good products include dark chocolate, soy chocolate, chickpea crisps, wasabi peas, sugar-free cookies (sweetened with alternatives), microwave popcorn and raw kernels, etc. Keep a few quick packet mixes for cakes, muffins and pancakes. Prefer organic and low-sugar versions where possible. It isn't always possible to be a saint and make your own baked goods from scratch; having these packaged possibilities still allows you to add fresh fruit, macadamia oil in place of saturated fats and you have the choice of using eggs or not. This is far better than resorting to store-bought goodies. Have milk on hand. It is always handy to have some shelf milk on hand for times when you run out and guests arrive. Depending on your needs, you can purchase dairy, soy, nut, grain and other milks that can be shelf-stored. Flavoured milks are also handy, including chocolate, vanilla and strawberry. Keep an eye on use-by dates and discard products that go beyond these. They might seem all right, but once stale, items never taste quite as fresh. They also do not provide the same nutrients as fresher, in-date items. Circulate goods at the back of the pantry and bring them to the front at least monthly, if not more often. It's easy to forget about items you can't see, and the less you waste the happier your wallet will be.",
