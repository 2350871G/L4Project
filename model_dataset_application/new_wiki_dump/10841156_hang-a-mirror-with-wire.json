          "description":"If you live in a house that was built in the 1940s or before, your walls are probably made of plaster and lath. If your house was built more recently, however, your walls are likely made of drywall. It is important to find out what your wall is made of before you hang your mirror because using a drywall hanger on plaster can damage a plaster and lath wall\u2019s surface. Plaster and lath is harder, thicker, and more brittle than drywall. If you\u2019re unsure what type of wall you have, try to push a pushpin into the wall. A pushpin will go right into drywall but not plaster."

You can use a bathroom scale to weigh your mirror. If you\u2019re using a bathroom scale, weigh yourself first and then weigh yourself as you\u2019re holding the mirror.

If you have a wall made of drywall, you can use a stud finder to locate a stud in your wall. A stud finder, however, won\u2019t work for a plaster and lath wall. To find a stud behind a plaster and lath wall, tie some string around a strong magnet. Then, holding the top end of the string, slowly move the magnet horizontally across the wall. The magnet should stick to the wall when it moves across a stud. The magnet you use will have to be strong, so simple magnets from your refrigerator probably won\u2019t work."

Then, use a pencil and mark on the wall the location of the upper right- and left-hand corners of the piece of wood. These marks will be where you put in your hooks. Hanging a Mirror on Drywall Go with picture hangers if you\u2019re hanging a mirror on drywall. If you\u2019re hanging your mirror on drywall, using picture hanger hooks and small nails is probably the best option. Picture hangers will hold up most light to medium mirrors, and they are also easy to install and remove. Picture hangers come in a variety of sizes and have different weight limits, so make sure the weight limit listed on the hardware packaging is higher than the weight of your mirror. Hammer in your hangers with small nails. Once you\u2019ve marked where you want your hooks to hold up the wire, simply use a hammer and nail to tap in a picture hanger on each corner mark. Tap the nail gently so that you don\u2019t accidently damage your wall. Once you\u2019ve tapped in your two picture hangers, step back and make sure they look level from a distance. Use a toggle bolt, molly bolt, or threaded anchor for heavier mirrors. These specialty types of hardware can bear a lot more weight than a standard picture hanger. There are a lot of different models and brands, so take care in choosing one that is appropriate for your mirror and wall. If you\u2019re working with a very heavy mirror, you must screw it directly into a wall stud. Working with a Plaster Wall Use a toggle bolt with a picture-hanging hook for a plaster wall. A toggle bolt has a spring-loaded nut that squeezes through a hole in the front of your wall and then springs open on the other side of the wall when you push it through the hole. It will allow you to hang a mirror or picture frame on your plaster wall without damaging the wall\u2019s surface. Drill holes into the plaster wall where you made your marks. Use an electric drill to drill holes through the plaster. These holes will need to be wide enough for the toggle bolt to fit through. Always remember to use caution when operating an electric drill or other power tool. Thread a machine screw through the toggle bolt nut. Once you\u2019ve drilled holes into your wall, screw your toggle bolt nut onto a machine screw. Pinch the wings of the toggle bolt closed and squeeze it through the hole. Once the bolt\u2019s through, pull it back to make sure the spring has opened. Then, tighten it against the wall with a screwdriver.",
