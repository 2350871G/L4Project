Also, the weather will be ideal in the fall to get the cuttings started. Aim to take cuttings before cold weather sets in. Taking cuttings at this time of year will also make the timing right for planting your new plants in the spring if they are going outside.Tip: This is the right time of year to take cuttings from a wide variety of climbers, such as passion flower, clematis, and celastus."

          "description":"Ivy cuttings work best when they are made from the current year's growth. You can identify new growth by looking for the parts of the ivy plant that look fresh and light green, not the older areas that have dark green leaves and thick stems. This kind of cutting is called a semi-ripe cutting. It is taken from this year\u2019s growth, not older sections. Avoid picking out pieces that are damaged or have unusual growth patterns."

This is especially important if you need to wait to put your cuttings in soil for an hour or more. If possible, take your cuttings in the morning. The ivy plant will have a lot of moisture in it at that time, which can help to keep the cuttings moist."

You can put cuttings in any type of pot, including terra cotta, plastic, and ceramic. However, no matter which you choose, the pots need to have drainage holes in the bottom. Putting several cuttings in one pot will cut down on the space required for the cuttings and it will also mean fewer pots to water.

However, losing a little of it on the top edge of the hole is fine.Tip: If the cutting is too long or unwieldy to stay in the soil even when it\u2019s pressed around it, you may need to keep it in place with a stake or other means of support.
