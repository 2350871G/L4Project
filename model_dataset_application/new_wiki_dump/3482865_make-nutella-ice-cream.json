Put this bowl in a plastic bag, then put the bag in the freezer for about 10 to 24 hours until it is completely frozen. The bag helps prevent freezer burn. This is important because there is a layer of liquid coolant between the inner and outer surfaces of the bowl. Letting it freeze completely ensures the bowl will stay cold as you make the ice cream (since you can't run the machine in the freezer)."
