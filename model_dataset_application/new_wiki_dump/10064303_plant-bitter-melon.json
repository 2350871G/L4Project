          "description":"Even though bitter melon is more resistant to the cold than other plants in its family, frost will kill it. Though it may vary depending on your location, you are usually safe planting your seeds in late April or early May. Bitter melon can grow at a minimum temperature of 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C), but it will grow slower than it would in warmer temperatures. You can also grow bitter melon in a greenhouse to prevent frost damage."

Growing on a trellis will help prevent diseases, make harvesting easier, and produce larger fruit. Bitter melon that is grown directly on the ground will not produce fruit as large as a trellised plant. If you do not trellis your melons, add a layer of straw or mulch to create a barrier between the plant and the soil, keep the moisture in the soil, and prevent fruit rot."
