This way, you can leave the shoelaces knotted instead of tying and untying the knot each time you wear the shoes. Ideally, you want to have about 6\u20138 in (15\u201320 cm) of excess shoestring hanging from each side of the last set of eye holes."

Once you\u2019ve cinched the original loop around the fold, spread the fold out a little to make a new, smaller loop above the knot you\u2019ve created. This \u201cknot with a loop sticking out of the top\u201d look closely resembles, if not matches, the knot you\u2019ll find when you first take your Yeezys out of the box."

Making a Noose Knot Create a starting knot as if you\u2019re tying your shoes normally. Cross one free shoelace end over the other, then feed one lace end into the gap beneath the cross and back out. Pull the knot tight against the tongue of the shoe. Then, curl one of the lace ends into an upright loop\u2014like a single \u201cbunny ear.\u201d\nThis \u201cnoose knot\u201d is a nice compromise between the standard shoelace knot and the \u201cfactory knot\u201d that the laces of your Yeezys are tied into when you first unbox them. The noose knot starts the same way as the standard shoelace knot, but ends up looking more like the factory knot. Begin winding the free lace end around the upright loop, about halfway up. Wrap the free lace end tightly around the loop you created with the other lace end. Wrap it around at about the midpoint of the original loop. After this, you\u2019ll have a loop above the wrap that\u2019s about half the size of the original loop. Keep winding tightly around the original loop, working downward. Wrap the free lace end around and around the upright loop, keeping the wraps tight as you go.

Stick the free lace end into this gap and pull it through all the way. Don\u2019t pull the free end tight quite yet, though. Tighten the knot by pulling on the free end and the loop above the wraps.

You can adjust the size of the top loop or the length of the remaining free shoelace end as you tighten them to get the exact look you want. To untie this knot, pull the free end back through the gap and unwind everything. Going with an Untied Look Unlace the shoestring from the last set of eye holes. Assuming that your shoes are already laced, simply pull each end of the shoestring back through the top eye hole on each side of the tongue. You\u2019re going to be crossing them beneath the shoe\u2019s tongue and re-lacing them through these holes. If you need to lace the shoes first, there are multiple criss-cross lacing and straight-lace options to choose from. Cross the lace ends underneath the tongue, leaving extra slack.

Aim for about 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) of free lacing on either side. Finish lacing through the last set of eyes. Feed each free end of the shoelace through the eye hole on the same side. Leave the shoelace ends dangling freely from these last eye holes. Crossing the laces under the tongue shortens the amount of shoestring hanging from the last set of eye holes, making it less likely you\u2019ll trip over your untied shoes!
