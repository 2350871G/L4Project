          "description":"A seedling is too delicate to transplant before it has leaves. Usually, it takes around 3-4 weeks for a seed to grow into a seedling that can safely be transplanted. Choose a sunny spot in your garden. Time your planting so that the soil has time to warm up after the last frost, for around 2 weeks. If the soil is too cold, the seedlings won't grow. In most places, it's best to plant seeds in late April, with seedlings ready to transplant by early- to mid-May. Spaghetti squashes need around 100 days to fully mature. If your growing season is short, try warming up the soil by covering it with black plastic."

Place the seedling gently into the hole. Cover the roots loosely with soil.Many squashes can be grown vertically to save space, but this isn\u2019t the best idea with spaghetti squash. The fruits are too big and it is difficult to try to support them on the vine when hanging. Overcrowding squash plants will cause them not to bear fruit. Varieties that grow as a bush, like Orangetti or Tivoli, are more compact. Vining squash spreads out for several feet on each side."
