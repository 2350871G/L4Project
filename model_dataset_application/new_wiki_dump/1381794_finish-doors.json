Do not work inside of your home, because the fumes from stain and alkyd can be toxic. You may need to have a second person help you lift and maneuver heavy doors. Sawhorses are the ideal work surface to use when finishing a door. Sawhorses allow you to work on the door while it lays at waist height. They also allow plenty of air circulation so the door can dry quickly. If you don\u2019t have sawhorses, though, you could prop up the door across 2 packing pallets. Or, stack 2x4 boards up until they\u2019re about 3 feet (0.91 m) high and balance your door across them."

Try to remove all stains, scratches, or oil marks that are left behind on the door when it was manufactured and shipped. Then, sand the door a second time using a fine 200-grit sandpaper. This will smooth out the wood and leave it ready for staining. If you prefer not to use sandpaper, you could use a sanding pad. These should also be available at local hardware stores.

Wring the cloth out, and then wipe it across the surface of the door to remove any particles from sanding. If you\u2019re concerned that there may still be some oil left behind on the door, try dampening the rag with paint thinner instead of water.

This is a great option if you don\u2019t have much time to finish a wooden door, or if the wood doesn\u2019t have a particularly attractive color or grain. Stop by a local hardware store and check out their gel stain options. Look for one whose color roughly matches the color of your wooden door. Gel stains goes on quickly and easily due to a thickening agent that\u2019s been added to the stain. Unlike traditional stains, it doesn\u2019t soak into the wood, but dries on top of the wooden surface."

Liquid stain comes in a variety of hues and opacities, though. Visit your local hardware store and look through their stain options until you find one that complements the shade of your door. Because traditional liquid stains soak into the wood, they don\u2019t cover up any of the wood\u2019s natural grain. This means that they do take much longer to dry, though."

Scrape the stick along the bottom and sides of the stain can as you stir to mix in as much of the stain as possible. Stirring allows you to mix up the stain without introducing air bubbles to the mixture. Do not shake the stain. While it may seem as if stirring and shaking will achieve the same effect, this is not the case.

Paint the stain onto the wooden surface of the door using long, smooth strokes. Each stroke should be about 18\u201320 inches (46\u201351 cm) long. Paint along the direction of the wood grain, not across it. Make sure to also apply a layer of stain to the thin sides of the door (that will press against the top, sides, and bottom of the door frame once it\u2019s hung).

Once most of the stain is dry, use a clean, dust-free cloth to gingerly wipe or blot up the excess stain. This will ensure that the stain dries evenly and doesn\u2019t leave any unsightly puddles behind. The fumes from stain can be flammable, so never throw the used cloths near a heat source.

As before, leave your garage doors open or set up box fans to ensure that there is plenty of airflow around the door as it dries. Tap the wood with your fingers in half a dozen locations once 4-6 hours have passed to make sure it's completely dry.

Use a 3 in (7.6 cm) flat brush to spread the gel stain across the surface of the door so it forms an even layer. Make sure to brush along the grain of the wood, and use long 10 in (25 cm) strokes so the stain goes on evenly. Let the stain dry for 12-24 hours, and then brush on 1 additional layer. You can skip sanding down the gel stain after you\u2019ve applied it.
