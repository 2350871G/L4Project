          "headline":"Eat expensive foods first.",
          "description":"Start with pricier foods, like steak or or shrimp. If you are vegetarian, start with gourmet foods or complicated dishes that you couldn't easily make for yourself. This way, you can ensure that you are getting what you paid for or even more than what you paid for."

        {
          "headline":"Use a salad or soup bowl for dessert.",
          "description":"Dessert bowls are often small, so get more dessert by using a soup or salad bowl for desserts like ice cream. If you aren't getting ice cream, use a plate that is made for main courses to get a piece of pie or cake. Do not do this if it is forbidden by the buffet you are eating at."

        {
          "headline":"Drink water the day before going to the buffet.",
          "description":"Staying hydrated will keep your stomach stretched, which will allow you to eat more food. However, don't drink a lot of water just before going into the buffet or you may feel full."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Eat a snack before the buffet.",
          "description":"Being too hungry can lead you to eating quickly at the beginning of your meal, which may make you feel full very fast. Eat a light snack about an hour before going to the buffet. A handful of peanuts, an apple, or a yogurt would be a good snack."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Start with lighter foods.",
          "description":"Don't load up on pasta or starchy foods when you begin eating. Start with lighter foods so that you will still have room in your stomach. Begin with a salad or shrimp as an appetizer before diving into heavier food."

          "headline":"Eat slowly.",
          "description":"Eating your food too fast will make you feel too full to eat as much as you would've been able to eat if you'd paced yourself. Chew slowly as you eat and take breaths between bites. Wait a minute or two before going back up for seconds."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Avoid soda.",
          "description":"The carbonation in soda may make you feel more full than water would. Instead, go for juice or water. If you want soda, wait to have it at the end of your meal."

          "headline":"Avoid wasting food.",
          "description":"Although you may want to get the most out of the buffet, try not to get more food than you can eat. It is better to get a lot of small plates and making multiple trips rather than wasting food. Also, keep in mind that some bargain buffets will charge for the price of the food you don't eat."

Take note of the things that look best to you. Exploring the contents of the buffet will also help you to avoid eating food that you don't really like or eating too much."

Remember, you can always go back for another plate when you want something else. Check to make sure the plate is actually clean before grabbing it. It shouldn't have any food particles or oily residues left on it. Get another plate if yours is dirty."

If you aren't sure if it is a line, simple ask one of the people if they're waiting. Some buffets may be more formal than others so take a look around to see how other people are behaving before serving yourself."

          "description":"Start your meal with an appetizer. This could be a salad, soup, breadsticks, or whatever you'd like. Take a small portion of it to save room for the rest of your meal. Starting with an appetizer will also help you to pace yourself during the meal. If you don't want an appetizer, you can begin with the main course."

          "description":"After finishing the appetizer, set aside your plate or put it in a bin for dirty dishes. Then, put a fresh plate on your tray. You do not have to replace your utensils. Get the main dish and side (or sides) of your choice. For example, you can get a chicken breast with mashed potatoes."

You can even go up for thirds if you're still hungry. If you're at a buffet you haven't paid for, like at a party, be considerate of others before getting seconds or thirds. Leave some food for someone else that hasn't gotten any food yet."

For example, don't get pumpkin pie if you don't typically like pumpkin dishes. If you can't decide, take a small amount of multiple desserts."

Often, it's a good idea to avoid foods that are sitting out in large vats. Foods that are in large vats are more likely to have been there for longer than other foods. Also, if the food appears to be discolored, a different texture than usual, or has an unusual smell, it is best to move on to another dish. Tell a staff member if you think any food has gone bad.
