Place the top part of the shell where the top has been removed over your lips and purse them together so that your lips are tightly closed in front of your teeth. It may be helpful to wet your lips slightly before you pucker them. Some people find it easier to make their lips vibrate when they\u2019re wet."

          "description":"Take in a deep breath with your nose for about 5-7 seconds, filling up your lungs. Try not to raise your shoulders as you breathe, and your stomach will likely expand outward slightly. Take as big of a breath as possible without making yourself lightheaded. When you\u2019ve taken a large breath, hold it for a second to prevent yourself from getting dizzy or lightheaded when you blow out."

          "description":"Use your stomach muscles to blow the air out of your lungs through your mouth, keeping your lips close together. Your lips should vibrate slightly, causing the conch to make a noise like a horn. If you\u2019re doing it correctly, it should feel like your lips are \u201cbuzzing.\u201d\nIf your lips aren\u2019t vibrating, try puckering them tighter or loosening them slightly to cause them to vibrate. It may also be helpful to tighten your cheeks slightly, like you\u2019re smiling, as you blow on the conch."

          "description":"Move your lips into a position where they\u2019re protruding slightly, like you\u2019re blowing a kiss, to lower the pitch of the conch. Slide your tongue just behind your upper front teeth to force the air through your lips faster, causing the pitch to become higher. Remember to keep taking deep breaths each time you blow into the conch. If you get winded or tired, take a break before trying again."

          "description":"Walk along the shoreline and look for a row of seashells that washed up in the high tide overnight. Most of the shells on the beach will be near this line, and you might be able to find a conch if you get there as the sun rises. Conches have a spiral \u201ccrown\u201d on their top, and a long curl at the bottom of the shell. The best time to find conch shells is after a storm with strong winds, since the winds and tides tend to carry the heavy shells farther up onto the beach than usual. It\u2019s common to find different parts of conches on the beach, like the tops, since they\u2019re easily broken."

          "description":"Most conch shells have a small hole at the top around the spiral part of the shell where there was once a small sea snail living. The hole should be small enough that you can cover it with one finger. Make sure the shell doesn\u2019t have any other cracks or holes. Never take a conch that still has a snail living inside of it. If you find a conch with a snail, move the shell back into the water so the snail can survive. A lot of conch shells have very large holes in them because they\u2019re fragile. Try to find one that only has 1-2 small holes that you can easily cover."

The conch should be slightly larger than your hand, but not so large that you can\u2019t comfortably hold it while covering any small holes in the shell. Holding the shell with 2 hands can change the pitch of the conch or make it slightly quieter."

Transfer the shell into the bleach solution, and let it sit for 30 minutes. Rinse it under cool water and rub the shell to remove any additional dirt. If you want to make the conch shiny, let it air dry completely and rub mineral oil or baby oil over the shell."

Then, find the 3rd curl from the top of the shell, and use an electric hand saw to cut the top of the shell at that spot. This creates a mouthpiece where you can put your lips to blow into the conch. The hole should be somewhere between the diameter of a dime and a quarter, depending on the size of the conch."
