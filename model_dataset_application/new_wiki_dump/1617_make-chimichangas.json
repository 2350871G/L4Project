The two most common are ground beef and shredded chicken, but feel free to experiment. The only real criteria is that the meat needs to be tender enough that it can be cut into small pieces -- large steaks may be difficult to maneuver. Vegetarians can make incredible chimichangas with spiced rice and beans. Cook the rice according to the packaging, but use vegetable broth instead of water. Add the beans afterwards and heat them up together before continuing. More adventurous eaters should try out Lengua (cow tongue), Tripe (intestines), or Cabeza (cow head)."

          "headline":"Cook the meat with the onions and garlic.",
          "description":"Add your meat to the hot oil and cook until browned, then add the chopped onions and garlic. Cook an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the onions are slightly translucent (clear, but not completely). Add your spices to this mixture so that the meat and vegetables have time to absorb them. Once the meat is brown and the outside is starting to caramelize, it is time to add the vegetables. If you are adding chopped bell peppers, chili peppers, or jalape\u00f1os, add them with the onions. For slightly sweeter filling, you can caramelize the onions before you add them."

Mix in red chili sauces for a spicy flavoring, enchilada sauce for a smokier filling, or sour cream for a richer taste. Mix in any beans and rice if desired. Stir the filling so that everything is coated in your sauce and spices once everything is added. Avoid making the mixture soupy or watery. Add enough sauce so that there is a little extra liquid at the bottom of the pan but no more than 1/4 of an inch. Some people prefer to keep the rice and beans separate as a \"dry\" component."

Set your stove-top to medium-high heat. Different oils have different smoking points -- so research yours if not using vegetable oil. You want the oil between 375 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit. That said, a little variation will not ruin the chimichangas if you remove them before they burn. Fry the chimichangas for 2-3 minutes each in the hot oil. After 1 minute, flip the chimichanga so that each side is in the oil. Do not put so many in the pot that you have no room to turn them -- you can usually cook only 1-2 at a time. Be careful of oil splatter. Never drop the chimichanga in from a high up and keep your face away from the top of the pot."
