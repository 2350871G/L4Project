If you live with other people, install the the curved shower rod at a height that allows the tallest person living in the house to get in and out of the shower without bumping their head.

To prevent the curtain from dragging on the floor of the tub, hang the curved shower rod at a height of 74 inches or more. If your bathroom ceiling is so low that you will be unable to install the curved shower rod at the appropriate height, modify your shower curtains so that they are short enough that they won\u2019t bunch up on the bottom of the tub."

          "description":"If your curved shower rod is not collapsible and does not fit perfectly across the length of your shower enclosure, you\u2019ll need to cut it using a hacksaw. Measure the width of your shower enclosure, then subtract it from the length of your shower rod. Divide the difference in half and cut that length from your shower rod. For instance, if your curved shower rod is 50 inches long, and your shower enclosure is 48 inches wide, cut one inch off each end of the shower rod. When measuring the length of the shower rod, measure from end to end, not along the curved length."

For instance, if the arc of your shower rod extends six inches out from where it otherwise would be (if it was straight), place the ends three inches inside the tub. That way, the shower rod and curtain will perfectly straddle the line marking the edge of the tub.

Once you\u2019ve centered the shower rod over the edge of your tub and you know the height at which you want to install it, measure down from the ceiling on both sides, and then make a small mark with a pencil or marker on the spot where you\u2019ll need to install the flanges. It is also a good idea to check the rod with a level. Place the level on top of the shower rod to ensure that the flanges will be even. Some curved shower rods don\u2019t need flanges installed, and instead feature extendable \u201cfeet\u201d that can be pressed directly against the walls of your shower or bathroom. This is called a tension rod and it is held in place by a spring that pushes the ends of the rod outwards. However, these rods do not stay up as well as shower rods that you mount on the wall. You can use felt pads between the end of the rod and the wall to help them stay put. Consult manufacturer directions for more information."

Line the flange up to the position where you want it, then drill through the holes around its perimeter. Drill slowly at first to avoid having your drill slip on the tile. Once your drill is through the tile, you will need to place an anchor through the tile to prevent it from cracking. If your shower enclosure has acrylic siding, don\u2019t drill through it.
