          "description":"If you don\u2019t already have an extra colander on hand, you can find one for a dollar or two at a local thrift store. You\u2019ll want to make it presentable enough to command attention at the center of your table. If you like its color or design as it is, just give it a wash and dry it well. You can also add a couple coats of spray paint to give your tablescape a pop of color. Get a spray paint primer and give your colander a priming coat first. Let it dry for at least an hour, and sand away any drip marks or imperfections if necessary. Then, add a coat of your favorite color. Spray on a second coat if necessary, and give it a full day to dry before putting anything in it."

Alternatively, you could choose many different kinds of a particular fruit to show off how it can vary. For example, you can choose red delicious, golden delicious, granny Smith, gala, and green apples to show how one fruit can vary in beautiful ways. You can also arrange different kinds of oranges, tangerines, and clementines for an arrangement with a uniform color but lots of size varieties."

Pack the cactus soil in tight where you need to if you have trouble with grains slipping through the colander holes. If the holes are too large, just use gravel throughout. If you\u2019ve chosen seasonal flowers or plants, like pansies or petunias, you\u2019ll need to line the base of the colander with sheet moss, so it retains moisture better.
