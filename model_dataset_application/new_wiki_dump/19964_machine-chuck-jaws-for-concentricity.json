  "text":" Preparation Clean the master jaws, (and uniformly grease them in their internal slide contact areas).  Select a set of top jaws for their near final net shape; work that needs a shallow depth of clamping also point to the need for shorter jaw height.  Determine that top jaw, (and master jaws), are number stamped/etched, (1-2-3,i.e.) for remounting purposes. Obtain appropriate chucking slugs or rings. Keep an inventory of these. These should resist gross deformation. Clean and provide flat planes of contact of mounting surfaces. Use fine files to remove raised brinelled surfaces. Care for the contact surfaces for the jaws, mounting bolts, and T-nuts.  Mounting Top Jaws & Pre-Forming Check the jaws for uniform distance from center; it is better that the jaws never contact each other under force.  In general shop practice, use a synthetic hammer face to uniformly beat the end of the hex wrench extension to bolt down the jaws. The wrench should tighten just beyond perpendicularity to the jaw. NEVER put side pressures on jaws during the mounting process. Check/set the operational chuck pressure to be used.  Pre-stress the top jaw mounts by clamping uniformly, at operational pressures, and process revolutions/minute.  Un-clamp, and machine the jaws for clamping the uniform chucking ring or slug. A diameter difference of .03\"(.76mm) or greater is common. Machine the jaws with much more travel in the clamping direction, ...removing the central (1/4-1/3) area of jaw clamping arc forms. This gives two center-line-parallel lines of force along the jaw and spindle axis. Clean, & proceed. Machine Jaw Work Surfaces Clamp the chucking slug/ring under operational pressures, and at low to moderate speeds, machine the form for clamping the work. Avoid center-line skewed chucking of rings & slugs. Ensure the jaw diameters have a .001\" (+.001\"/-.0005\")(.032mm,+/-.02mm) interference fit.  It may be helpful to machine the central arc clamping areas of the jaws, this gives two center-line-parallel lines of force along the jaw arc and spindle  center-line.  Carefully remove burrs, and smooth contact surfaces.  Test the total indicated run-out of the work piece. Check for deformations, and check for marring.",
