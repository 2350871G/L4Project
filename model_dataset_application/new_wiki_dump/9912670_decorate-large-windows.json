          "headline":"Treat multiple windows as one by framing them with drapes.",
          "description":"To create a grand visual, look at your multiple windows as one large window. Hang the drapes so they run in a horizontal line along the top of the windows\u2014the drapes will fall towards the floor on the far left and far right side of the window section. Use hooks to hold the drapes, or put the drapes on a rod if all of the window frames are even. Use a level to ensure the hooks are even before installing them. Draw a line or dot with a pencil  where you'd like the screw to go into the wall to hold the hooks. Install the hooks by holding each one steady and drilling in the screws\u2014it's likely that the hooks will come with their own hardware. To make your window look grand and visually appealing, hang a curtain rod 1 foot (0.30 m) above the top of the window."

          "headline":"Hang sheer curtains from a rod for a delicate and soft effect.",
          "description":"Sheer curtains are super easy to install\u2014all you have to do is hang them across a rod and they\u2019re ready to go. The sheer quality will allow the room to be lit by sunlight while also creating an opaque view through the curtains. These are great for summertime as they have a light, flowy look and feel. Select white sheer curtains to make the room lighter. Opt for sheer curtains with a colored tint in them for a more dramatic look. You can choose a rod that comes with its own attachments to make installing it against the wall super easy, or you can pick out a simple rod and choose your own hooks."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try out a valance to allow light in while adding detail.",
          "description":"A valance is a single piece of fabric that hangs from the top of the window. It only covers a small portion of the window. Many valances come with their own mounting hardware and directions since their designs can be very different. Imagine drapes that go all the way across your window, except with the bottom four-fifths cut off\u2014this is what a valance looks like. Valances come in different patterns and materials, giving you a wide variety to choose from. Hang a valance by using a level to make even marks where the brackets should go, following the specific instructions related to your chosen valance to screw the brackets into the wall. Valances also come in boxed form (also called a cornice) for a more formal feel. They look like a window box at the top of the window."

          "headline":"Add a window scarf for elegant draping.",
          "description":"A window scarf is whimsical, but doesn\u2019t provide privacy. Wrap the window scarf loosely around a rod above your window, similar to how you would twist streamers horizontally for a party. This adds a nice decorative effect, and each end of the scarf can be used to shield a little bit of light at each end of the window. Window scarves can be bought at a home goods store or online, or you can make them out of your own material. You could use a long scarf or tapestry, if desired. You can create as many or few loops around the rod as you'd like. Simply drape the window scarf around the rod in loose coils, letting the ends of the scarf run down the side of each window evenly."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a roman shade for easy-to-use curtains.",
          "description":"A roman shade allows you to choose how much light you let in through the window horizontally. If you\u2019re trying to decorate multiple windows, you can have a separate roman shade for each window, or you can use one large roman shade for all of the windows combined. Roman shades are made from fabric, woven wood, or bamboo. Some have a cord while others are cordless, which is ideal for a seamless look. Roman shades are usually lifted up and let down using a string hanging from the top of the shade. Install a roman shade by choosing where you'd like it to be mounted, using a level to make even marks where the brackets should go, and screwing the brackets into place using a screwdriver. You can pick out roman shades that are already designed, or you can have them custom-made to your specifications."

          "headline":"Install hooks at the corners of oddly-shaped windows for unique drapery.",
          "description":"If your window has odd slants or unique angles, hang the drapes so that they go along the lines as opposed to covering them up. Use simple drapes of a solid color to make the window the main focal point. Use hooks to attach the drapes then twist them around each hook so that they stay in place, if desired. Drill a hole for each hook using a bit that is the same size as the hook, then screw the hook into the hole. If your windows are uniquely- or oddly-shaped, consider getting custom-made window treatments."

        {
          "headline":"Paint the trim of the windows to draw attention to their shape.",
          "description":"Instead of adding curtains or covering up the window, paint the trim of the window with a color of your choosing. Opt for a bold color to make the window stand out, or use a color present in the room to complement your decor. Put down strips of painter's tape along the wall on the edges closest to the trim to make sure you don't get paint anywhere you don't want it. Use a brush with a smaller width than your trim to ensure you can paint the details, and use at least 2 coats of paint, letting the first coat dry before adding a second. Put down a drop cloth beneath the window to make sure you don't get paint on the floor."

          "description":"If your window shows a view of a forested backyard with lots of trees, you might consider hanging drapes that are a similar green shade as the trees. Choose colors that complement the outdoors, helping to blur the line between inside and outside. If your window overlooks a skyline, you could use drapes that are the same color as the sky, or even a shade of the sunset. With this look, your windows will seem to disappear as the focus point is the outside view."

It could be a fabric with animals on it, symbols, patterns, or another type of loose design. For example, if you\u2019re trying to choose drapes for your child\u2019s bedroom, pick out a fabric with zoo animals, the ABCs, or their favorite book characters on it. You can use curtains to easily and inexpensively change the style of any room."

Hang the ruffled curtain on a rod, or install nicely-designed hooks on each side of the window to hang them on. Use a level to measure where the hooks should go if using them, and install them using a drill and screws designed for the hooks."
