          "description":"Limit the number of impulse purchases you make since you\u2019re spending money that you can save instead. Look for subscriptions you have, such as streaming services like Netflix or Hulu, and ask yourself how often you actually use them. If you only use it once or twice a month, then cancel the service. Only spend your money on items you need and bills you have to pay so you have extra income to set aside. For example, avoid buying coffee or drinks while you\u2019re out. Instead, bring your own drinks since it\u2019s much cheaper. It\u2019s okay to make a few small impulse purchases every so often, but don\u2019t let it become a habit."

Once you\u2019re at the store, only get the items you wrote on your list so you don\u2019t impulsively buy anything. Cross things off your list once you buy them so you don\u2019t accidentally buy them again."

Look online or through cookbooks and pick out a few healthy recipes that you want to make for the week. Write down all the ingredients that you need and go grocery shopping for the things you don\u2019t already have. Plan meals for a week in advance so you always know what items you need to buy.

Check for any additional sales that the store may be having and make note of any items you need that are discounted. Don\u2019t buy items that you don\u2019t need just because you have a coupon for it. Some coupons and discount codes may only work online or at certain locations. Check for online services that sign you up for coupons and store rewards since they can help you save more money while you\u2019re shopping."

It may be difficult to stop giving gifts, but you can go somewhere special, make homemade cakes and desserts together, or spend a night at home doing your children\u2019s favorite things. Make memories together so you can still have a fun time even if there aren\u2019t gifts involved.

It may be hard for them to understand, but talk to them about how it\u2019s important to save money and that you need to use the money for food and other things.
