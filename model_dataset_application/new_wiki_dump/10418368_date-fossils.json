          "description":"This method only works on young fossils as carbon decays quicker than other minerals. If no traces of carbon are found in a fossil, this indicates that it is older than 100,000 years. Use an accelerator mass spectrometer to measure the amount of carbon in the fossil. The amount of carbon in fossils decreases over time, therefore the lower the amount of carbon in a fossil, the older it is. Fossils need to be clean in order for carbon dating to be accurate. This method requires specialist equipment and is usually done by experts."

The greater the number of fissures in a rock, the older the fossil is likely to be. Use a LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) tool to measure the uranium content. The high-tech equipment required for this technique means that it is generally only used by experts."

Fossils are found in between these layers and thus can be estimated to be a similar age to the rocks that they around. Test the amount of argon using a thermal ionization mass spectrometer. This is a technical method used by experts with access to specialized equipment."

Heat fragments of the fossils in water and then hydrolyze the fragments in 6M hydrochloric acid. This process allows you to measure the extent of the racemization process. This method is only accurate if the humidity, temperature, and acidity conditions of the original environment of the fossil are known."

If you look at a cliff face made from sedimentary rocks, you will notice that there are layers of rocks. These layers are often different colours or made from different textured sediment. The oldest rocks are at the bottom and youngest are found at the top. If a fossil is found in one of the top layers, it can be assumed that it is younger than the fossils and rocks below it. This information can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, if a human skull was found below a dinosaur bone it could indicate that humans predate dinosaurs."

If a fossil is found next to an index fossil, it can be assumed that the fossil is a similar age. For example, brachiopod fossils are thought to be 410-420 million years old, meaning that if you found a fossil beside a brachiopod fossil it would likely be a similar age. If a fossil was found between an index fossil that is 410-420 million years old and an index fossil that is 415-425 million years old, you could deduct that the fossil would likely be 415-420 million years old as this is the overlapping range."
