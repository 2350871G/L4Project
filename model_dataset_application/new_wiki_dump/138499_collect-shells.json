When the tide is low, you\u2019ll be able to search for shells that may be covered by water during high tide. More beach is exposed, so low tide is a great time for a shell collecting excursion. Tides are caused by gravitational forces between the earth and moon. Tide levels and times depend on where you\u2019re located, so it\u2019s best to look online or in your local paper for tide charts for your area before you head off to collect shells. Different varieties of shells often wash ashore during big storms, so you can find some gems if you head to the beach right after bad weather."

If you\u2019re interested in searching in deeper waters, using a net to scoop up sand will be more effective than digging around with your hands. With a spade or shovel you can dig out shells you find deep in the ground. A filter or screen can be used to sift through sand and mud.

Gently washing your shells can make them look beautiful for your display or collection, and can also remove any odor that may linger. You\u2019ll need dishwashing liquid soap, warm water, an old toothbrush, some rags, WD-40 or another lubricant, and possibly tweezers to clean your shells up. Scrub your shell with warm water and dish soap using the toothbrush. The brush is great to get into all the ridges and crevices of the shell. You can use the tweezers to pick out any stuck debris or barnacles. Dry your shells with the rags, and use the WD-40 to shine them up. If your shell has animal tissue attached, you may need to boil it for a few minutes before beginning the cleaning process. Boiling it will loosen up the tissue, and you can use the tweezers to pull out the tissue."

If you\u2019d rather display your collection methodically with labels, boxes with dividers work excellently. Those can be found at most container stores or craft stores. If you want to keep your shells pristine, keep them away from direct sunlight. Shells react differently to bright light, but many are damaged by too much. The oil from human skin can also cause wear and tear to the shells. Clear display cases are great to show off your shells without constantly handling them."
