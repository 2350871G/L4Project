Also keep in mind that a lack of labels does not necessarily mean that the container can\u2019t be recycled. Labels to look for include:\n\nWidely Recycled: this type of container is recycled by at least 75% of municipalities. Check Local Recycling: the container is recyclable, but fewer than 75% of municipalities do so. Not Currently Recycled: although the container may be recyclable, very few communities will accept it. Widely Recycled at Recycling Points (Check Locally for Kerbside): the container can be dropped off at a local recycling center in most areas. Universal Recycling Symbol (also known as the Mobius Loop): this could mean that the container is recyclable, but it could also only mean that it was made from recycled materials. #1 through #7: these numbers are usually located within the Universal Recycling Symbol on plastic containers. They indicate the type of chemicals used to make this particular type of plastic."

          "description":"Visit their website or call their offices. Ask if their recycling program includes your specific type of container. Specify whether it is a plastic container or a paper container in case they recycle one type but not the other. If it is a plastic container, include the number within the Universal Recycling Symbol (#1 through #7) in your search, since one type of plastic may be accepted, but not another. Plastic containers may be more likely to be accepted. Some communities may even require that they be included with your recycling instead of your regular garbage. Paper containers are much less likely to be recycled due to a plastic lining inside. This lining prevents freezer burn, but it also interferes with the recycling process and may contaminate other paper products that are processed at the same time."
