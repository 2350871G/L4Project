Slice your cake in half with a piece of dental floss or very sharp knife.  Set each half of your cake on a cookie sheet, platter or tray covered with waxed paper (it must fit into your freezer).  Slice through the middle of 1 box of praline ice cream (or your favorite) with a serrated knife (do not remove from box before slicing).  Remove the cardboard.  Lay 1 half of the ice cream on each half of your cake.  Slice around your cake to make it even with the ice cream.  Place your cake in the freezer for 1 to 2 hours.  Remove from the freezer 2 pints (0.94 L) of vanilla ice cream.  Let the ice cream soften for 20 to 30 minutes.  Stir the ice cream until smooth.  Remove your cake from the freezer.  Cover the surface of each cake with the ice cream using a spatula.  Place your cake back into the freezer for about an hour.
