If you\u2019re not sure when the leak might have first occurred, you can also check to see if your usage is higher than normal. In the United States, the average person uses about 88 gallons (330 l) of water per day."

          "description":"Check your bill to see whether your monthly water usage is reported in centum cubic feet (CCF). If it is, multiply the number on your bill by 748 to convert it to gallons. For example, if your bill reported that you used 13 CCFs, that\u2019s 9,724 in gallons. You\u2019d then divide the total gallons used in a month by the number of days in your billing cycle to get the average amount of gallons your household used per day. So, for example, 9,724/28 = 347.3. Finally, you can divide the gallons used per day by the number of people who live in your household to find the amount used per person per day. For example, 347.3/4 = 86.8 gallons (329 l) This is slightly less than the typical American uses per day. These calculations will differ depending on the typical units of measurement where you live. Check your utility bill to see how your water is measured each month."

If you have an analog meter, you\u2019ll see a small arrow that should move in a clockwise circle as it measures 10 gallons (37.9 L) (or CCFs) of water usage. If the arrow on an analog display is moving quickly, or if the low-flow indicator (which should be a black or red triangle or star) is rotating, you have a leak. If you have a digital meter, the reader will flash between the meter read and the \u201cflow rate.\u201d Watch the flow rate for 10 flashes. If it\u2019s ever higher than 0, you have a leak. Both of these tests show fast, obvious leaks. It\u2019s a good idea to check for slow leaks as well, just in case."

After about 20 minutes, re-check the meter. If it\u2019s moved, you have a continuous leak. You can also wait for 1-2 hours if you\u2019re concerned the leak is extremely slow and will be difficult to detect. If you\u2019d like to completely turn off your water, buy a water meter key at a local hardware store. You can use this key to turn the valve in the meter to the \u201coff\u201d position."
