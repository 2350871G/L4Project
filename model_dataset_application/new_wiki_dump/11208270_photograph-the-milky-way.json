Avoid the full moon if possible."

A DSLR camera is best for this kind of photography. Use a fast-aperture, wide-angle lens with a maximum aperture of f/1.4 to f/2.8. If you don't have the right kind of lens, you can still shoot the Milky Way by using a higher ISO. However, your final image will show more noise."

In order to get the best results, your camera should be completely still for the entire exposure. Find a tripod that won't shake or blow around in the wind. A heavier tripod does not necessarily equate to a more stable tripod. Test your tripod before you go."

For example, 500 divided by a 24mm lens is 21 seconds. This formula gives you the maximum amount of time you can expose your shot without seeing any movement in the final image. Use this rule as a starting point. If you see movement, try a shorter exposure time. If you're using a crop sensor camera, multiply the time by 1.5 (for Nikon and Sony cameras) or 1.6 (for Canon cameras)."

If your camera has a Live View setting, turn it on and use the focus ring to bring the brightest star you can see into focus. If not, simply turn the focus ring to the infinity symbol. If you end up with blurry photos, try adjusting the focus first."
