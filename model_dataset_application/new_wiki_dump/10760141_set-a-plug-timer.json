After flipping the switch, double-check that your plug is dry and connect it to the outlet. For outdoor use, be sure to plug your timer to a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet to prevent shock. Most products are set to \"Outlet On\" by default, which is the other option aside from \"Timer On.\" When using your plug timer outdoors, let the switch hang downward at least 5 feet (1.5 m) above the ground.
