Many immersion blenders have a spring loaded catch that clicks when component parts are fitted into place, while others may have screw-on attachments. To assemble your blender you should:\nLine up the motor body, which will be the heaviest part of the blender, with a blender attachment. Fasten these parts together securely. Press the release button on the motor body of the blender if the attachment doesn't connect easily."

For many of these blenders, there is only a single speed, often indicated by the word \"ON.\" Be sure to keep the blades of your blender below the surface of your mixture to prevent food from spattering. When blending, move the blender slowly up and down. This will encourage a well blended, smooth consistency in your mixture. For tough ingredients, like vegetables, or thick mixtures, like some soups, you may have to blend for some time until the mixture is smooth and consistent. Running the motor of your blender for extended periods can do damage to it. Try to limit your blending to 30 to 50 second intervals."

The blending shaft should be washed by hand in hot water and should also be cleaned with a mild soap. When cleaning the blending shaft, be extra careful around the blades.

Then move your immersion blender up and down until your ingredients are blended to your preference. Depending on your tastes, you'll have to determine how much of each ingredient to use. For example, if you like spicier salsa, you might want to add more jalape\u00f1o to the mix. You may want to add your tomatoes last to your mixing dish. This way, they'll be at the top and blend first. This will release liquid that will help blend the other ingredients. Keep your blender level when operating.
