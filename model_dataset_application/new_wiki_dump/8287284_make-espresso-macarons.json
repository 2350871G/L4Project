  "text":" Making the Cookie Part Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (178 Celsius). Make sure your rack is on the third row down. Place your almonds in a food processor. Process them for about 1 minute or until as fine as possible. Add confectioner's sugar to the food processor. Process it together with the almonds for about 1 minute or until fully combine. Put the mixture through a sieve. Press on the clumps to get them through. Repeat the grinding and sieving process until you have less than 2 tablespoons of solids left in the sieve.  Whisk egg whites and granulated sugar by hand. Make sure to get it fully incorporated. Beat the mixture for 6 minutes. Blend 2 minutes on medium, 2 minutes on medium-high and then finally, 2 minutes more on high. Add instant-espresso powder. Beat on the highest speed for 30 seconds. Pour the dry ingredients.  Fold the mixture using a spatula from the bottom of bowl upward, then press flat side of spatula firmly through the middle of the mixture. Repeat until batter flows similarly to lava. Rest a pastry bag inside a glass. Use a 3/8 inch round tip. Transfer batter to bag. Then, secure the top. Prepare two baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Use small amounts of extra batter to secure the corners of the parchment. With your piping tip a 1/2 inch above sheet, pipe the batter into a 3/4-inch round shape. Then, swirl the tip off to one side. Repeat the process, separating the circles by 1 inch. Tap on the counter to release air bubbles. This should only take 3-4 firm taps. Sift espresso powder over half of the unbaked rounds.  Adding the Filling and Baking Make your filling. Dissolve instant-espresso powder by using 1/4 teaspoon of hot water. Then, mix into Swiss meringue buttercream. Bake for 13 minutes. Make sure to rotate your sheet half way through baking. Take them out when they have risen and set. Let the cookies cool.  Spread your filling on half of the cookies and top them with the other half of the cookies. You can place the cookies in a cookie jar, a plate or in a wide mouth wine glass. Finished. Wrap leftover macarons with plastic wrap and refrigerate.",
