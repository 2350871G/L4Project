The mesh creates a barrier and reduces the need to use chemicals. Mesh netting also protects your grapes from birds and small mammals that could be pests. Sunlight and water can still penetrate the netting, so there is no need to worry about removing it to care for your vines."

Having a section that is too big would be better than cutting a section that is too small and cannot be used. The mesh should be large enough to completely cover the tops of the vine and secure tightly at the trunk."

For vines that are growing alongside a wooden fence or structure, you can cover the vines with the netting from the side, and attach it to the nearby structure using a small staple gun."

Simply place the drawstring bag over a grape bunch and pull the strings to tighten and close the bag. Alternatively, try placing brown paper lunch bags over a cluster of grapes and stapling it shut. This is an easy, affordable option for grapes that have grown to size and are near ripening."

Become familiar with the types of pests present in your area to help you identify which ones are causing your issue. You will need to know the specific insects because many insecticides are only effective against certain types of pests. For instance, the grape berry moth is a common pest found in the northeastern United States. The insecticides Intrepid or Sevin are rated as highly effective in controlling them, but Assail is not effective at all. Assail is effective, though, in controlling leafhoppers, which are prominent pests in California and the western United States."

          "headline":"Find a home and garden pesticide specific to your type of insect.",
          "description":"You will need to read the labels to be sure you get the right product. For instance, if you\u2019ve determined that your insect problem is from the grape berry moth, you will need a product that specifically states that it is effective in controlling grape berry moths. Some products, like Home Orchard Spray, aim to control a variety of common grape vine pests including the grape berry moth, Japanese beetle, and rose chafers. A broad-scope product may be a good option if you have multiple types of pests and/or haven\u2019t been able to identify the specific type of insect affecting your vines. Pesticides typically range from $10.00 - $20.00 USD and can be purchased as a concentrate that needs to be mixed with water, or as a ready-to-use spray. Read the label thoroughly before you use a pesticide. Wear gloves and goggles while you spray so you don\u2019t come into contact with any chemicals. Some pesticides are not safe for consumption so make sure to follow the label directions. Don\u2019t let pets or people near grapes you\u2019ve sprayed until the amount of time passes as recommended."

Check online or at your local home and garden store to find a product that fits your needs. Neem oil should not be applied to table grapes after they have bloomed, so apply it to the vines early in the season for the best results."

Reapply the pesticide as needed and as directed on the product label. Be sure to wear protective gear like gloves and safety glasses when applying chemicals."
