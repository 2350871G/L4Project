Press the dough to a flat rectangle and send it through. Fold one end over the center, then the other, making a stack of three layers of dough. Flour lightly and roll it through again. Repeat at least three times to add chewy texture. Repeat this technique if your pasta tears. Set the machine to a slightly narrower setting.
