Add a packet or tablespoon of sugar and the cream of your choice. A popular cream for coffee is half and half. You could also use regular milk, almond milk or soy milk. Avoid powdered coffee creamers, as they can clump when you add them to coffee. You can also swirl a cinnamon stick in your coffee. This will help reduce the bitterness and make the coffee taste sweeter. Adjust the proportions to your liking."

A latte consists of one or two shots of espresso mixed with six to eight ounces of steamed milk. In South American countries a popular variation of this is called Cafe con Leche (coffee with milk). This is also recommended since it's coffee, milk, and sugar steamed together. The outcome is a frothy and delicious beverage."

This will appeal especially to the lovers of coffee flavored ice cream. This style is served sweet, with whipped cream on top, and sometimes a flavour of your choice infused into the beverage.
