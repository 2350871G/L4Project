Expert Answer\t\t\t\t\t\tQ\t\t\t\tWhen asked, \"How much does it cost to install laminate flooring per square foot?\" Mitchell Newman\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrincipal, Habitar Design and Stratagem Construction\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMitchell Newman is the Principal at Habitar Design and its sister company Stratagem Construction in Chicago, Illinois. He has 20 years of experience in construction, interior design and real estate development. EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tMitchell Newman, the Principal of Habitar Design and Stratagem Construction, says: \"The most inexpensive laminate flooring can be as little as 80-90 cents a square foot, and it goes up to about $2-$3 per square foot. You'll also need a pad underneath the flooring, which can cost between 25-75 cents a square foot. Then, the exact cost of the installation will depend on the contractor, but that can be anywhere from $1.75-$4 a square foot.\""
