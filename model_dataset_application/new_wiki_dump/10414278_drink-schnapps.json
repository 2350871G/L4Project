If you do not want to use milk, you can use half-and-half instead. Stir the milk constantly and add 1 cup (150 g) of bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips. Instead of using traditional milk chocolate, you can use white chocolate instead. Continue stirring the milk until all of the chocolate has melted. Increase the temperature to a medium heat, and whisk in 3 cups (710 mL) more of your selected milk. Lower the heat if the mixture begins to boil as the chocolate will burn easily. Then pour the hot chocolate into a small, heat-resistant glass, and stir in 1 and \u20442 fluid ounce (30 and 15 mL) of peppermint Schnapps.
