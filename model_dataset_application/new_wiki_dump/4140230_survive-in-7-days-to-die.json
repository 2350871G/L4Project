Game Mode \u2013 You have three options to choose from: Survival, where you get to explore Navezgane  County, Arizona to uncover the truth behind the apocalypse; Deathmatch, where you get to compete with other players to get most kill scores.

But be careful, sometimes zombies have gathered right at the exit. Multiple exits are more useful but make sure to securely block it up. Strengthen your shelter and crafts; install traps as well. The longer you survive in this game, the stronger you get. But equally, the zombies grow in number and become smarter as days pass."
