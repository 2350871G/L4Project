          "description":"Craps really isn't complicated when you remember that the entire point is gambling on the sum on a pair of dice. One player rolls the dice, typically trying to get a 7 or 11. If they don't get this number on the first roll, they establish a \u201cpoint\u201d number that they have to roll again before rolling a 7. Generally, you bet with the table in the hopes that the player rolls the number they need. There are also some options for betting against the table, meaning the player rolls a losing number. On the first roll, called a come-out roll, 7 and 11 are winners. The numbers 2, 3, and 12 are called craps numbers and mean bettors lose. The winning and losing numbers vary depending on the stage of the game. If the player establishes a point, 7 becomes a losing number."

          "description":"The dealer lays a disk on the table to keep track of the game. If you see the disk flipped to the black side with the word \u201cOFF,\u201d you know a new round is starting. On the first roll, the come-out roll, a 7 or an 11 means everyone who bet on the pass line wins. A 2, 3, or 12 means everyone loses. The pass line is the most basic element in craps betting, so it's the best place to start when learning the game. A new round cannot begin until someone places a bet on the pass. Numbers like 4, 5, and 6 are neither wins nor losses. The rolled number becomes known as the point, and the game moves to the next phase of play. Another option is to bet on the don't pass line. If you take this option, you're betting against everyone else. You win if the shooter rolls a 2 or 3 but lose if they roll a 7 or 11."

          "description":"The point is the number the player rolled if they didn't win or lose on the come-out roll. The potential point numbers are 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10. The dealer flips the disk to the white \u201cON\u201d side, and then the shooter continues to roll the dice in the hopes of rolling the point number again. Rolling a 7 means a loss. The pass line bets stay on the board until the round is over. You win your pass bet if the player rolls their point number. For example, when the point number is an 8, the shooter tries to roll an 8. If the shooter rolls a 7, all pass line bets lose. Play continues until the shooter rolls one of these numbers. If the shooter rolls the point number, play starts over with new pass bets. If a 7 comes up, the same thing happens but someone else has to roll the dice."

When the shooter rolls a 7 or 11, you win. If they roll a 2, 3, or 12, you lose your bet. Keep in mind that the point doesn't affect your bet. If the point is 6, you don't get anything when the shooter rolls a 6. The come bet is also separate from the pass line. You may win the come bet with a 7 but lose the pass bet after the point is established. Similarly, play may continue even after a 2, 3, or 12 comes up. A related option is the don't come bet, where you win if the shooter rolls a 7 and lose if they roll their point number. This is a relatively safe and simple bet, but keep in mind that it means going against other bettors."

You don't need to blow on them or do anything else you see in movies. Shake and toss! The craps table is long, so you throw the dice rather than roll them.
