If you have very thin liners, use 2, that way your liner won't fall of your pie when you get them out of the oven. Cut small circles in the Pillsbury pie dough and press them inside the liners. Make sure the dough fits on the bottom and sides of the liners. Set the tin aside for later on. Making the filling Cut 2 apples into cubes. Cut them into 0.25 inch (5-6 mm) Pieces. Put the apples in a bowl of lemon juice. Melt the caramel cubes on the stove.  Add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 2 teaspoons of sugar to your apples. Also add 1 teaspoon nutmeg and a pinch of salt. Then stir well. Add 1 teaspoon of melted caramel to your apples.  Put the filling in the dough. You don't have to fill it up all the way to the top, just around 2/3, otherwise your pies might explode in the oven. Put a small circle of dough on top. Make sure it covers all of the filling.
