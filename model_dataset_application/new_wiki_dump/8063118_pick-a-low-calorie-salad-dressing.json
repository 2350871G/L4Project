Accordingly, these should be the first three things listed on a bottle of store-bought dressing. All the way down the list, there shouldn\u2019t be stuff you can\u2019t easily pronounce. In fact, the shorter the list, the better. Vinegar and water are both calorie free. Olive oil is a common ingredient, and most of its fat content is especially healthy - namely, monounsaturated, omega-9 fatty acids. Extra virgin olive oil is especially good, while canola oil can be a decent base as well. The rest of the ingredients in a healthy dressing should be things like herbs and spices."

Look for dressings with less than 300mg sodium and less than 3g of total sugars per serving. Additives like caramel coloring will not add to the nutrition or mineral content, so you may choose to avoid these ingredients."

Go for the option with the lowest saturated fat, with either oil or vinegar listed as the first ingredient. Making your own is still healthier (and cheaper! ), but if you prefer to purchase your dressing you'll likely have some decent options at a grocery store in your area. Newman\u2019s Own Lite Italian, Ken\u2019s Light Options Oil & Vinegar, and even Wish-Bone Light Italian all score well in the healthy scale for \u201clight\u201d dressings available at many U.S. grocery stores. Good standard vinaigrette options that are readily available in the U.S. include Annie\u2019s Organic Balsamic Vinaigrette, Newman\u2019s Own Balsamic Vinaigrette, Lily\u2019s Balsamic Vinaigrette, and Drew\u2019s Classic Italian."

          "description":"True, fats contain lots of calories. However, choosing a fat-free option is not the best way to cut calories from your salad dressing selection. This is because certain fats help your body get vitamins and other nutrients from the other ingredients of your salad. Further, fats slow down your digestion, and keep you from getting hungry again too quickly. Finally, fats contained in the right types of oil can positively contribute to your heart\u2019s health. When manufacturers take out the fat, they may add sugar and salt to make up for the lost flavor. Dressings labeled \u201cfat free\u201d are also often heavily processed and don\u2019t contain much nutritional value. Further, they\u2019ll wind up making you feel hungrier sooner than dressing with a bit of fat in it. Generally, you do want to avoid saturated fats. Most importantly, opt for dressing that have less than 0.5 grams of saturated fat per serving. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, are those with health benefits when eaten in moderation."

Even if you find an especially healthy dressing option, drenching your salad will ultimately add unnecessary calories to your meal. Measure out a two tablespoon serving and stick to that amount. Dress your salad with just one tablespoon initially. After a few bites, you can add the other tablespoon for a flavor boost. You may be surprised by how much differently - and sometimes better - a salad tastes with less dressing!"

Mix 6oz of lite, firm silken tofu, \u00bc cup water, 1\u00bd tablespoons cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) lemon juice, 2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) tahini, 2 chopped green onions (just the green parts), 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of chopped parsley, a clove of garlic and a bit of salt and sesame oil in a blender. Simply blend until you get your desired consistency. This one is vegan, too! If you\u2019re feeling especially indulgent, you can also make healthier versions of ranch or caesar dressings at home by using low-fat yogurt, as opposed to mayo or some of the other unhealthy ingredients commonly used in creamy dressings."
