You will need to take classes that cover a particular area of astronomy. This degree can take four to five years to complete. There are many different areas of astronomy that you can study at the Ph.D level. Take the time to figure out what interests you, such as planets and moons, the cosmos, or the galaxies. As part of your Ph.D, you are usually given the opportunity to do internships and research fellowships in your particular area of study. This is a great way to gain work experience in the field."

          "headline":"Complete your Ph.D dissertation and take the qualifying exams.",
          "description":"To get your Ph.D, you will need to create a dissertation proposal. Your dissertation should provide a deep study of a particular topic in the field of astronomy. You will then need to write the dissertation, which can range from 80 to 100 pages. You will also need to take qualifying exams to graduate with a Ph.D. The qualifying exams will vary depending on the program you are in. You usually have to write a paper and do an oral presentation to pass the exams. Examples of possible dissertation topics include exploring star formations, examining high mass planets, and analyzing radio pulsars."
