Criss-cross the notes. If you can, have the clues hit into every room of your house. Make sure you second-guess your own kid's intended route-markings, after you place the clues in their intended spots. Check to make sure the planned route you've set up for your kids can safely get them and you there, without crossing into a former location's answer. A light mark of a pencil can help make sure you haven't crossed into a previous location's clue a second time around. Clues that are in a room, can be placed in two different spots, but make sure they are easy to get access to."
