Harder charcoals produce lighter cleaner edges, while softer charcoals are better for blending and making deeper lines. The compressed charcoal stick is a hard charcoal that is great for making darker lines. Compressed charcoal also comes in white to help with highlighting. Soft charcoals are great for blending and creating smudges throughout your piece. However, these are some of the messiest charcoals to work with.
