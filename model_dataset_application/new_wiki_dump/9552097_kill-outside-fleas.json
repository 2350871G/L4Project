If you\u2019re concerned that toys or other objects have fleas, wash them with soap and hot water or soak them in a bucket overnight. If you choose to soak them, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (14.8 to 29.6 ml) of dish soap to the bucket. The dish soap will increase the water\u2019s surface tension and help prevent any fleas or larvae from escaping."

Clean out organic debris in your gutters, tops of sheds, and other spots that might harbor fleas."

          "description":"If you have a lawn, regular mowing is a key to overall flea control. Additionally, mowing before applying an insecticide will help ensure the product comes into contact with as many fleas, eggs, and larvae as possible. Be sure to use a bag to catch clippings or rake them up after mowing. Leaving behind clumped clippings creates damp, shady spots that allow fleas to hide and breed. Taking care of your lawn will help prevent flea infestations. A well-maintained lawn that gets ample sun is an inhospitable environment for fleas."

Look for products that contain either chlorpyrifos or permethrin, which are more effective against fleas. Spraying the product with a hose will give you more volume and coverage than a pump spray application. Find a product that comes in its own hose spray container. That way, you won\u2019t need to purchase a separate hose sprayer or worry about proper calibration and dilution. Check the label to see how much area an insecticide covers by volume.

Keeping the Area Flea-Free Treat pets, interiors, and outdoor areas at the same time. If you have pets, give them a flea bath and get a flea control treatment from the vet that's designed for their species and size. If possible, limit the amount of time your pet spends outside. Vacuum carpets, mop hard floors, clean clothes and bedding in your washer\u2019s hot water cycle, and apply an indoor insecticide.
