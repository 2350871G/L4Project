  "text":" Choosing the Candles and Paint Select suitable candles. The candles need to be of the solid, thick and broad kind for this to be most effective, especially if you're a beginner. You could try thinner candles when you feel more confident. Find paint that will adhere to the candle's wax. Acrylic paints tend to be the best for this project, in any colors suitable to matching the candle. When choosing the paint, if it is not certain from the paint instructions as to suitability, ask the retailer for help. Be aware that not all paint will adhere well. It's a good idea to ensure that the paint chosen is non-toxic, as the candle will burn through the designs eventually, releasing smoke and particulate matter into the air, air which you and your family breathe. Creating the Design Template and Stamp Choose the design for the candle. It is best to keep this simple and repeat the same one or two symbols. Some ideas for simple and effective designs include:\nCelestial objects: Sun, moon, star, rainbow, etc. Animal: Dog, cat, mouse, etc. Plant: Flowers, trees, leaves, etc. Create the template for the design. Either draw a design onto thin cardboard or use an existing stencil. If making it on cardboard, cut out the template design. Add the design to a rubber eraser. Transfer the outline of the template onto the eraser using pencil or a marker that works on the eraser. It can help to use a bit of poster tack to keep the cardboard template in place, while a stencil sheet should be held in place with care as you draw around its outline. Repeat for any additional designs, using separate erasers. Using a craft knife, cut away the background around the design you've just traced onto the eraser. This is now your stamp for adding the design image to the candle. Adding the Stamps to the Candles Work out the design layout for the candle. Are you using just one symbol or perhaps two? How will two or more designs be interwoven down the candle? Work this out on paper beforehand. Some approaches might include:\nRows or columns of a single design; or use two designs and alternate the rows or designs\nMake a band or two of a single design only, perhaps across the top or base of the candle\nFollow a pattern that uses the design to form the shape or outline of a word, geometric shape, picture, etc. Easiest of all\u2013\u2013simply add designs randomly.
