  "text":" Plug the Hole in the Clip Slot Remove all darts and clip. Make sure that there is nothing loaded in the gun. Pull the rod back and then forward. This is just the same as reloading. Flip the gun upside down and look into the clip slot with a flashlight. You will see a very small hole on the end of the black piston. When the gun fires, this hole lets an amount of air escape, disabling the gun's full potential power. (This is not the air restrictor, but it does reduce the power of the gun. ) Place a piece of very strong, thin tape on the hole. This will block the air from escaping, causing more air to push the dart out of the barrel. Load a clip and test fire. The dart should go much farther now. Replace the Spring Unscrew the screws on your gun. You will need to have access to the inside of your gun, so remove the screws on the stock and body of the gun.
