          "description":"Food safety is important when cooking raw meat, so find a fresh pink rack of ribs at your local grocery store. Many people choose to smoke with St. Louis style (spare) ribs, which come from near the belly on the pig. They are substantial and tasty \u2014 very easy to cook. If you like, you can also select baby-back ribs, which come from the back side, near the loin. Since baby back ribs are a little less substantial, they're harder to smoke while still keeping them juicy and tender. Adjust this recipe if you do decide to use baby back ribs; the cooking time will lower significantly. While you can smoke prime rib or standing rib roast, that cut contains more meat than spare and baby back ribs do, so you'll need to follow slightly different instructions to cook it properly."

When salt hits meat, it brings moisture out to the surface. If you apply your rub and cook right away, the moisture brought out to the surface will leave your precious pork. If you apply your rub and let the meat rest, however, the moisture journeys back into the meat through a process called osmosis. This process produces consistently juicier meat."

Next, make a smoker pouch by wrapping wood chips in aluminum foil and then puncturing the foil several times with a knife to let the smoke escape. Place this at the bottom of the grill but not directly underneath the ribs. Remember to soak your wood chips for at least 30 minutes prior to creating your smoker pouch.

Choose from among applewood, cedar, hickory, maple, mesquite, oak, pecan, and many more."
