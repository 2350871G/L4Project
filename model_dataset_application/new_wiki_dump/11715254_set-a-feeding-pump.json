Make sure that you only use the amount of formula determined by your doctor. Then, twist the cap back on tightly. Most feeding bags come in either small or large sizes. For larger feeding bags, add an extra 15 millilitres (0.063  c) for priming, which involves pushing a small amount of formula through the tube to get rid of excess air. For small feeding bags, add an extra 10 millilitres (0.042  c) for priming."
