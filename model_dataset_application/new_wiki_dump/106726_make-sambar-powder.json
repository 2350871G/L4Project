If you dry roasted the fresh versions of these ingredients, the sambar powder would not be as spicy and make it more difficult to grind them into a fine powder. You will be using each bowl to cool each ingredient after dry roasting. Alternatively, you can mix all your ingredients in a large bowl after roasting. However, it may take longer to cool if you mix all the ingredients together after dry roasting."

Use a wooden spoon or spatula to keep the ingredients moving and prevent it from burning. Dry roasting times will vary depending on each ingredient. If you are using dried hing, or asafoetida, powder, dry roast it for 2 minutes with the coriander seeds. If you are using whole asafoetida, save that ingredient for later and just dry roast the coriander seeds alone for 2 minutes. For dried red chilli peppers, cumin seeds, peppercorn, dry roast them each and separately for 2 minutes. Dry roast the fenugreek seeds for 5 minutes. For the channa dhal, dry roast it for 10 minutes. If you are dry roasting large quantities of each ingredient, dry roast them in batches. After dry roasting each ingredients, set them aside to cool."
