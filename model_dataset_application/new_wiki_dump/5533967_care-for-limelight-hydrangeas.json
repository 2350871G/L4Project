Use a soaker hose to water the shrub or water it by hand using a watering can to avoid getting the leaves wet. Keeping the leaves dry will reduce the likelihood of fungal disease. Set a 1-inch deep dish or can next to the hydrangea. This is to measure how much water is delivered in inches when using a soaker hose. Check the can periodically.

'Limelight' can be pruned in late winter or very early spring to reduce its size, improve its appearance or encourage it to produce larger flowers. It produces flowers on new stems each year so pruning it in the winter or early spring will not reduce the number of flowers it produces. Trim the stems back by no more than 10 to 20 percent in the shrub's first winter or early spring. They do not have to be trimmed at all but can be to even up the branches and tidy up their appearance. Dead branches should be removed at the base of the branch whenever they are noticed.

This will let 'Limelight' devote more energy to fewer branches resulting in larger flowers. Always use sharp hand pruners to prune one branch at a time. Hedge shears will tear the leaves and make 'Limelight' look ragged. Fighting Off Pests Check your plant for pest activity. 'Limelight' is occasionally attacked by slugs, snails, aphids, spider mites, spittle bugs and thrips. Check the leaves for snail and slug activity. They chew on the flowers, leaves and stems. Combat slugs and snails. If they become a problem, either pick them off the shrub in the morning and drop them into a bucket of soapy water to drown or sink tuna or cat food cans into the soil around the shrub and fill them with beer. Snails and slugs will crawl into the beer and drown. The edge of the can should be level with the surrounding soil. Check the cans each afternoon.

Combating Diseases Watch out for certain diseases. Bud blight, leaf spots, rust and mildew will occasionally afflict 'Limelight'. Bud blight causes brown flecks on the flower petals and mature flowers to rot. When the weather has been cool and damp, brown spots and gray mold may appear on the leaves and stems. Leaf spots are caused by fungi that cause brown or black spots. Rust is also caused by a fungus that coats the leaves with an orange, powdery substance. Mildew can become a problem for 'Limelight.' Powdery mildew makes the leaves appear white and powdery while downy mildew will cause yellow spots on the leaves with gray fluffy mildew underneath. Monitor your watering habits to combat these diseases. All of these maladies are caused by fungi. To help prevent them, do not get the leaves wet when watering and water in the morning so that the leaves can dry before evening if they do get wet. Prune away diseased parts of the plant. If 'Limelight' gets any of these diseases, prune off the diseased leaves, flowers and stems immediately and put them in the trash. Disinfect the pruners by soaking them for 5 minutes in household disinfectant then rinse them off before using them to prune other shrubs. Rake up any fallen leaves and debris from around the base of the shrub and dispose of that, too. Fungal spores live in the debris and will be splashed back onto the shrub when it rains. Fight bacteria. Bacterial wilt is another disease that can infect 'Limelight' hydrangeas. Bacteria infect the shrub at the base, interrupting the flow of moisture and nutrients to the rest of the shrub. Unfortunately, there isn't much that can be done for the shrub if it becomes infected with bacterial wilt. The leaves and stems will wilt and the whole shrub may die within weeks. If this occurs, appropriate watering is all that can be done to help it. If the soil seems wet, let it dry before watering again. If it is dry, water the shrub more often.",
