      "headline":"Get used to using your slow cooker.",
      "description":"Each brand cooks slightly differently, so you should get a feeling for how hot your slow cooker runs even on the low setting. Many people believe that older slow cookers cook at a lower temperature than newer versions. If you find that your slow cooker runs hot, then you will want to reduce the amount of cooking time listed in the recipe. You may find the vegetables are mushier and meats fall apart, if you do not make the adjustment to slow cooker recipes."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Brown the meat in a frying pan before it goes in your slow cooker.",
      "description":"Even if this is not required on your original recipe, it adds a complex flavor to the meat because it seals in the juices. The meat will also hold together better, while it cooks for hours rather than minutes. You can also dredge raw meat, like chicken breasts or pork cutlets, in an herb and flour mixture. Then brown it on the stove top. The result will be a more crisp, complex flavor."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Adjust the cooking time of your normal recipe.",
      "description":"Most recipes should be adjusted to the \"low\" setting on the crock pot rather than \"high.\" The following times are good guidelines to follow for time adjustments:\nIf the cooking time is between 15 and 30 minutes on a stove top or in a conventional oven, then set it to cook for 4 to 6 hours on low. You can also set it for 1 and a half to 2 hours on high. If the cooking time is between 30 and 45 minutes, then set it to cook for 6 to 8 hours on low. You can also set it between 3 and 4 hours on high. If the cooking time is between 45 minutes and 3 hours, then set it to cook for 8 to 10 hours on low. You can also set it between 4 to 6 hours on high."

    {
      "headline":"Start converting recipes that already use wet heat for cooking.",
      "description":"Look for recipes that are stewed, simmered, slow roasted or braised. These recipes will convert easily and with the best results because they use similar methods."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Buy an easy slow cooking cook book.",
      "description":"Make sure it includes recipes for slow cooking meats, vegetables, soups, stews and even casseroles. Find the recipe in the book that is most similar to your favorite recipe and model your favorite recipe on it."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Cut the amount of liquid ingredients in half, if you are converting a stew or braising recipe in a slow cooker.",
      "description":"The slow cooker traps liquid inside the pot, so extra liquid will result in a soupy texture. If your recipe does not call for any liquid, and does not contain fatty meats, then add 1/2 cup (118 ml) of broth or water."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Reduce the amount of liquid you put in a converted soup recipe.",
      "description":"If the directions say to simmer the soup uncovered, then reduce the liquid by 1/3. If you are directed to simmer it while it is covered, then reduce the amount of liquid by 1/4."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Wait to add your herbs and spices to your recipe, until the end.",
      "description":"Herbs tend to break down and disappear over long hours in the cooker, where spices tend to become dominant. To avoid either of these things from happening, add herbs near the end of the recipe, and add extra salt and pepper before you serve."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Place root vegetables into the bottom of the slow cooker.",
      "description":"They take longer to cook than other vegetables. Cut them into 1 inch (2.54 cm) pieces and place them underneath meats or other ingredients."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Place dairy ingredients, such as milk, cream, buttermilk or soft cheeses into the slow cooker near the end of the cooking time.",
      "description":"Some hard cheeses, such as Parmesan or Swiss may be put in the cooker at the beginning, because they hold together more firmly."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Add cornstarch or flour near the end to thicken the recipe.",
      "description":"If you have too much liquid in your pot, remove the lid and turn the heat up to high. You can also drain off the liquid with a baster and reduce it in a pot on the stove. If you want to add cornstarch or flour to thicken the sauce, create a slurry first. Add a few spoonfuls of flour or cornstarch to a small bowl and mix it with cool water. Make sure there aren't any lumps before adding it to the slow cooker."
