          "description":"Ice cream won't wait for you and melts fast, making it hard to photograph.. To avoid losing those precious moments when the ice cream still looks fantastic, it is important to prepare all of your equipment and props in advance for still food photography. Have all of your camera equipment in place, including tripod (if using), special lenses, filters, etc. A tripod can be an excellent piece of equipment for indoor ice cream photography; you can set the camera in place at the angle that pleases the eye best, relying on props (such as yogurt containers, etc.) to serve as mock ice cream until you've adjusted the camera to the exact settings desired. Once done, grab your ice cream, remove the props and arrange the ice cream in the predetermined positions, and shoot away for the next few minutes. Check that the lighting is just as you want it (see below for tips). For ice cream that will be sitting in a bowl or other prop, place the prop into the freezer for at least 20 minutes prior to taking the shot. That way, you will have a very cold prop for the ice cream to sit on, providing you with extra time to make adjustments before the ice cream melts. This is especially important for warm locations or if you're taking the ice cream outside in the sun. For photography on the go, simply have your camera ready for those candid moments of people with their ice creams."

          "description":"Are you setting up the photo of a specific ice cream after making or purchasing it, or are you simply hoping to come across ice creams being held by people outdoors as you walk about? Obviously, if you're setting up the ice cream shoot from scratch, there is a bit more effort involved. Do you want the ice cream in a bowl, in a cone, on a plate? Perhaps its original packaging is interesting enough to use as well. Do you want someone holding the ice cream, a pet licking it, or some other action shot? Will you need to set the shots up, or are you looking for candid shots on a beach, at a park, or at a special event? Do you want the ice cream to be the main feature or to form part of a set-up with other food? If so, the other food will need to be prepared and arranged in place before adding the ice cream at the last moment (see arranging props above). Do you want to photograph the ice cream in a kitchen, a dining room, or perhaps al fresco in your garden? Each option has its own challenges of light, background, temperature, and accessibility that need to be worked out in advance. If photographing people with their ice cream, consider whether you want to take photographs of children (always delightful but can be hard work to have them stand still) or adults, individuals or groups, and so on. Is the situation appropriate to take photos on the fly or will you need to ask for permission? At a bare minimum, it is polite to ask \"Do you mind if I take a photo of you/your kids eating that ice cream?\" If the potential subjects ask why, you can explain in greater detail."

White is a good stand-by  background for many food types, as it doesn't crowd out the food and it provides plenty of background light to set off the food.

          "headline":"Consider which lighting will best enhance the ice cream subject.",
          "description":"Food photographers often prefer a single light source \u2013 it's cooler and quick to work with. Aim for natural light wherever possible. If you can position the ice cream near a large window with a white gauze curtain or thin white sheet across it, this will create suitable, adequate indoor natural lighting. Dappled light (sun filtering through trees) can be an effective look but you will need to work quickly as the sun will move, as well as melt the ice cream. Avoid using a flash unless you are really sure about what you're doing. A flash will often be too harsh for the delicacy of ice cream and can cast unflattering shadows. Try off-camera flash with a diffuser or reflector, balancing flash with ambient light (preferably sunlight to avoid color balance problems), or multiple flashes. Avoid having too little light (or too little exposure). Underexposed ice cream will appear insipid, failing to capture the delicious subtleties of the ice cream flavors. Set the white balance setting on your camera, particularly if not using natural light. The ice cream can take on yellow or blue hues otherwise. Automatic white balance rarely gets things quite right. Consider using a reflector to bounce back light and increase the brilliance of the ice cream. Plain mirrors or white card can also do the trick. Practice the positioning until you get a sense for good placement (perhaps try with a prop to give yourself time!). Reflectors, white card, or mirrors can be held in place with clamps and supported against any item that is solid and able to be covered by a background cloth."

Some of the things to think about with color include:\nIf you are photographing a trio of ice cream flavors, be sure to select colors that match well. Scale them according to their contrast. Be careful that no color will simply fade into the background or be overwhelming against the other colors. Use asymmetry. Angle the photo so that the darkest color resides in the most illuminated area, and the brightest color resides in the least illuminated area. Check that accompanying props or food are neither stealing the limelight from the ice cream nor creating an overall dullness. For example, accompanying fruit, plates, packaging, and backdrops should be a good contrasting or compatible color. A cheat that you can consider is recoloring or touching up the ice cream post photography. Use a good digital photo program for coloring in the ice cream shades differently until you're satisfied with the end result.
