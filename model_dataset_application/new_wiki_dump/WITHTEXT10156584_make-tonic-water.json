Make sure you\u2019re using a non-reactive saucepan, which can change the flavor of the liquid. Avoid using copper, aluminum, or cast iron saucepans to make your tonic water."

Don\u2019t lower the heat before the sugar is completely dissolved. This can leave tiny sugar granules in the water, which can affect the taste of the tonic."

          "description":"Cinchona bark gives the tonic a bitter taste, and can be found in the herb section of your local grocery store or online. Once the water has calmed to a simmer, stir in \u00bc cup (28 grams) of chopped cinchona bark. Alternatively, if you can\u2019t locate cinchona bark, you can use the powdered version, called quinine. Add 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of the quinine to the water and stir thoroughly to combine. Keep in mind that ingesting too much quinine can be hazardous to your health, so don\u2019t add more quinine than needed. In general, cinchona bark is safer, as it is easier to filter from the tonic. If you can\u2019t find quinine or cinchona bark in the herb aisle of your local grocery store, look in your local natural health store."

Then, extract as much juice as possible from each fruit, and add it to the water to make the citrus flavors more potent. If you want to use only one of the fruits to make your tonic, use 3 of the same fruit. For example, if you wanted to make a lemon tonic, you would zest and juice 3 lemons into the water."

Be sure to chop it into very small pieces so that the flavor can diffuse throughout the water. If you don\u2019t want to chop the ginger, use a grater to shred it into smaller pieces. It can be more time consuming, but is often easier than chopping."

If you don\u2019t have a press, cover the top of a bowl with a coffee filter, and slowly pour the tonic onto the filter and let the liquid drip through. When using coffee filters, be patient and work slowly. Make sure the filter is secured over the top of the bowl by wrapping a rubber band around the outside or taping it in place.
