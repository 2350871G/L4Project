          "description":"In order to be sure that a given fungicide will actually work, you\u2019ll first need to verify that you\u2019re using the right product. Inspect your plants closely to look for symptoms like rotting, discoloration or a strange powdery residue. You can then conduct a quick search to find out the specific infection and how best to treat it. Rotten or blackened areas are typically a symptom of blights and leaf spots. Cankers most often appear as cracked, dried patches on the trunk or stem. Tiny spore-producing structures may sometimes spring up around the affected area. A mildew is likely to blame when fungal growth or discoloration begins to form on the leaves of the plant. Wilting occurs when an infection begins to kill a plant. Most of the time, wilted plants will need to be carefully pruned to remove the diseased sections."

You\u2019ll also have a chance to describe your problem in greater detail to knowledgeable garden experts who can help you find a solution. Knowing what kind of plant it is and bringing in a clear picture of the issue will help them identify the infection. Organic fungicides are also typically sold in the gardening departments of superstores like Walmart. If you\u2019re unable to find the product you need in stores, try an online retailer that specializes in organic gardening supplies."

          "description":"Fungicides that come in powdered form can be sprinkled over the foliage, which will fight the infection without harming the plant. Liquid products, on the other hand, tend to work faster because the antifungal compounds have already been dissolved in water. There\u2019s also less chance that they\u2019ll be carried off due to wind or rainfall. While all fungicides are designed to do the same basic job, the method of application can make a big difference depending on the type of plant you\u2019re treating, current weather conditions and other factors. Powdered fungicides tend to contain more concentrated amounts of chemicals, and aren't recommended for treating young or delicate plants."

It can be used to clear up almost every type of infection, including blights, powdery mildew and anthracnose. For this reason, copper is a go-to solution for many organic gardening enthusiasts. Most commercial organic fungicides contain some amount of copper. In high concentrations, copper can be toxic to humans and animals. It should therefore be used sparingly to avoid creating deposits in the soil or runoff water. Always follow the instructions on the label."

          "headline":"Use sulfur to deal with serious infections.",
          "description":"Like copper, elemental sulfur is naturally antifungal. Plants displaying symptoms of leaf spots, rust or botrytis can benefit from regular application of the diluted chemical. Sulfur is more potent than other organic compounds, however, so it should be handled with caution. Never apply sulfur-based fungicides to young growth, or in extremely hot temperatures. If you\u2019re not careful, it can burn right through the foliage. Avoid using sulfur on \u201csulfur shy\u201d fruiting plants like grapes, gooseberries, currants and apricots."

Gardeners have been using Bordeaux mixture for centuries to fight a multitude of botanical diseases while preserving the health of their plants. When putting together your own Bordeaux mixture, it\u2019s best to follow the 4-4-50 rule\u20144 pounds (1.8kg) of copper sulfate and 4 pounds (1.8kg) of lime diluted in 50 gallons (189L) of water. This will produce a solution that\u2019s strong yet safe. You can also purchase premade Bordeaux mixture.

Most of these substances can simply be diluted with a few ounces of water and applied using a spray bottle. Try whipping up a basic DIY fungicide solution by infusing alliums (pungent plants like crushed cloves, garlic and onions) in a small amount of water or citric acid. Homemade organic solutions will be most effective for dealing with slow-moving diseases such as blights and leaf spots. More serious infections should be pruned to keep them from spreading. Natural ingredients are generally mild enough to be used on plants of all species and ages, including seedlings and offshoots."

Some organic fungicides like Soil Guardian are meant to be applied directly to the soil or to new seedlings. Others, like sulfur and lime, can cause damage to plants if applied in hot temperatures. If you're using a homemade remedy, it's best to apply the solution once or twice a day, then observe the plant's health after a couple days.
