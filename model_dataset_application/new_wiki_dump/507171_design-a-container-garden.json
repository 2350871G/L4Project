          "description":"Terra cotta looks good with a variety of plants, and can be simple or elaborate, but it is heavy and isn't resistant to frost. Unglazed terra cotta has good air circulation and can give a refreshing Southwestern vibe to your garden. Try a variety of sizes for visual appeal."

          "headline":"Look into wood pots.",
          "description":"Wood has a natural look and will give your garden an earthy, holistic feel. Wood is usually used for window boxes and barrels. You can line the container with plastic or burlap to protect the wood. If you use plastic, cut drainage holes in the bottom. Make sure that the wood has not been treated with plant-harming chemicals. Wooden planters will need to be properly maintained over time or else the quality could deteriorate. Plant-safe, low chemical sealers are available at your local garden center. Pour the sealer into a container, such as a large paint tray and use a paint brush to apply the sealer to the wooden planter. Allow the sealer to dry for 24 hours before placing plants inside. Test the sealer with a little bit of water to see if it is completely dry. If it is, the water will form small droplets but will not soak into the wood."

          "headline":"Go for lightweight and affordable plastic pots.",
          "description":"Plastic pots are lightweight and come in almost all colors, shapes, and sizes. They are readily available at your local garden center. They can also be made to look like clay or other materials. The benefit to plastic is that it won\u2019t chip and break in cold weather; however, plastic pots do not allow very much air circulation."

          "headline":"Try moss containers.",
          "description":"Moss is usually used in hanging baskets. It allows you to have plants come through the sides of the container as well, not just at the top. Since moss dries out quickly, you will need to water it often. Hanging plants you can try out are ivy, geranium, petunias and black-eyed Susan vines."

If you want it to look more interesting, you can use a contrasting container. For example, your entire scheme could be made up of different shades of blue -- sky blue, midnight blue, navy blue, etc. Another example would be a range of purple shades. For instance, deep purple, indigo, lavender and lilac shades."

For example, you could pair together shades of both yellow and purple. Yellow with dark purple would more dramatic than yellow with lavender. Another complementary color scheme would be shades of both blue and orange."

For example, you could group a variety of herbs like lavender, thyme, basil, catnip and rosemary together.
