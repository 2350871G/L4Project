Each successive wrap should be closer to the tips of your fingers. Try wrapping the paracord around your first three fingers, or even just your first two to make it easier."

With your free hand remove the rope from the hand you wrapped it around, keeping the first set of turns in place. Keep the first three turns intact by pinching the rope together with your forefinger and thumb.

When done, you should have three turns of rope looped vertically and cinched loosely by three horizontal wraps. Do not pull tight, these wraps need to be loose. Finish the horizontal turns by creating a loop, with the remainder of the rope, going through the three vertical strands. Here, you\u2019re taking your final turn and passing through the middle, not the outside."

Go over the horizontal wraps but between your first three vertical loops. Continue with this motion three times. Weave the rope through the top and out the bottom. You should notice the monkey fist shape coming into place."
