Tear out pictures of ideas that you like, or digitally save images that appeal to you. Try to figure out a theme early on and stick to it. For example, think about whether you want your kitchen to be modern, traditional, or eclectic. If you admire a friend\u2019s home, ask them if they\u2019d mind telling you where they shopped or found inspiration."

Ken Koster, a software engineer who recently renovated his home, says: \"If you need to live in the house while you're remodeling it, you can do it room by room, but it's going to add a tremendous amount of time and cost to the project. If you're doing an extensive remodel, though, it's best to move out if you can, so you can do all the demolition and framing first, then the plumbing, electricity, and any necessary inspections. After that, you can move on to covering everything up.\""

Contact several architects to find one that you want to work with. Before you hire an architect, make sure to ask to look at their portfolio.

If your project is smaller, consider a specialty contractor who works on installing items like counter tops and bathroom fixtures.

For example, if you don\u2019t have the necessary skills, you might end up doing costly damage. Also consider your timeline. It will likely take you much longer to do the job than a professional. Decide if that is a major factor in your decision. If you decide that you want to do the work yourself, make sure that you do so safely. Do not attempt to rewire your house, for instance, if you don\u2019t have that sort of experience. However, you can paint the walls in your living room yourself without any prior experience. Don't be afraid to hire a professional only for the things you really need. For example, you might hire someone to install your appliances, but choose to decorate on your own."

Pick a target date, but be prepared for setbacks. For example, sometimes items you purchase might be on back order. If you hire professionals, check in with them at least once a week to check on their progress. If you are doing the work yourself, resist the urge to multitask. If you start on the bedroom before the bathroom is done, you\u2019ll end up with 2 projects, which is harder to manage than just 1 at a time."

Many buyers prefer granite counter tops, so if there is a chance you will sell or need home equity in the future, granite is the smart choice. You can choose from a variety of shades, from light to dark. Make sure to price several different cuts of granite. Oftentimes, a $25 slab will look just as good as one that costs $45. Choose laminate for a more affordable option. If you have an average sized kitchen, you can expect to pay $500-$1200 to have laminate installed. Granite would cost about $3,000-$3500. Keep in mind that they typically don\u2019t last as long as granite. Laminate likely won't last more than 10 years, while granite can last for over 100 years."

You might want a new table or buffet for the dining room. Your furniture should fit your lifestyle. For example, if you have a large family, consider a long dining table with a bench on 1 side to accommodate several people. If you and your partner love movie night, a comfy sofa might be your priority. Accessorize the room for an easy update. If you don\u2019t have the budget for a complete remodel, add accessories to any room for an easy update. In the living room, add new picture frames, lamps, and area rugs. You could add a new end table to your bedroom. For your dining room, you might display decorative plates on the walls. To jazz up your table, add new place mats and napkins. Mirrors are a great way to make a small room look larger. To fill a large room, consider purchasing some oversize pieces, such as a long table or sectional sofa. Redesign the lighting to add mood and ambiance. Harsh overhead lights can make a room feel less homey. Try adding several table and floor lamps to a room to make it feel more welcoming. You can also add a chandelier or pendant to give your room an interesting new focal point.",
