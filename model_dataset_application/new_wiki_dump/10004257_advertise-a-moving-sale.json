If the headline doesn\u2019t get their attention, they may not read the rest of the ad either. Include your general location in the headline. You can list the name of your town, the part of town you live in, the subdivision, or you can be as specific as the street name. Including this information in the headline helps your ad show up in search results. Try saying something like, \u201cWe have to go. . .And our stuff does too! North End moving sale.\u201d"

If they have questions, they may not bother to ask and might just move on to the next ad. Put the date, including the day of the week. Ex: Saturday, June 10th\nAdd the start and end times, including a.m. or p.m., and state if you will not accept early birds or latecomers. If you don\u2019t state that it\u2019s not allowed, expect a few stragglers. Ex: 8:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. No early birds, please! Give your full address to make it easy for shoppers to plan their trip. Alternatively, list only the general neighborhood and use large signs to direct traffic."

          "description":"List items that are high in demand, rare, or that would be a great deal because it is significantly lower than retail price. Include the price and use descriptive words so shoppers know why your coffee table is better than another one listed down the street. Furniture, appliances, baby items, power tools, and electronics are popular items that people that look for. If you are selling any types of these items, consider listing them as examples. Be sure to include descriptive words such as, \u201clike new,\u201d \u201cone of a kind,\u201d or \u201cstill in the box.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to use brand names if you know it is popular. Tell shoppers if you are firm on your pricing, or put OBO (or best offer) to indicate that you may accept offers lower than the listing price. Mention if your items come from a smoke and/or pet-free home. Ex: \"Fisher Price deluxe baby swing with 5 speeds. Like new\u2014only used 2 times! Smoke-free home. $50 OBO\" or \"Gently-used Coach Purse. Purchased for $400, sacrifice for $75 firm.\""
