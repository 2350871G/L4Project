Districts 1, 2, and 4 are career districts, so make sure your strongest players are from those districts. Distribute walkie-talkies so you can alert people if you're \"killed\".

Alternatively you can have a three strikes system for rule breakers, so that people are not excluded for making one mistake. When fighting, a hit to the torso should be a \u201ckill\u201d, whereas a hit to the ankle or any other insignificant place should not count as a \u201ckill\u201d unless you are hit more than 3 times. If anyone plays dirty (i.e. hitting someone in the face), the offender is \"killed\" instead."

Also make sure the weapons don\u2019t look real, so bystanders won\u2019t freak out.

Instead you should gather supplies yourself beforehand. Make sure to put a bottle of water, a snack (like a granola bar or pack of crackers), a couple of weapons, and a jacket in each backpack. And make sure you have enough backpacks for everyone. Place them in the center of your area. If you can try creating a cornucopia or using a park shelter as one, it will make your games more realistic. If you want, you can also make special packages which one person can hide around the playing area. Make sure this person is not playing, so that way they don\u2019t gain a leg up on the other tributes. Put extra food, weapons, or other items in the package to help the players through their game."

Find a big area with lots of places to climb and hide. Set up a cornucopia. Play with water guns; put non-staining red dye in them. Play. If you are shot with the water in your head or torso, you're dead and you must lay down until the games are over. Alert the game-maker. The victim or the killer should text the game-maker so they can mark them dead on a list. Continue playing. The game is most fun when it goes on for one to two hours. The time it takes depends on the number of people and how large an area you've chosen. Declare the winner. The last person standing is the winner. Add even more fun. Let players decide a tribute name and what district they are from. You can even do reaping, and have someone be Caesar Flickerman and do interviews.",
