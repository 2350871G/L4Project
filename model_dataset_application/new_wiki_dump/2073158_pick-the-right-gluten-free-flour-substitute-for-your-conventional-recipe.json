      "description":"White rice flour is low in protein and high in starch, soy flour is high in protein and lower in starch. Albumen has no starch and is all protein. When you think about your resulting product, think about whether it should be strong and have lots of structure (high in protein) or tender and crumbling (higher starch, lower protein). Is it the base of a sauce? High starch. Is it coating on a fried good? A moderate mix of both. This will also make it easier to swap out one flour for another if you have or develop other food sensitivities."

Has a neutral flavor and leaves minimal lumps\nCookies - equal parts by weight white rice, tapioca, and low fat soy flour (substitute teff for soy if you do not tolerate soy well). Pie crust - 3 parts white rice flour, 2 parts tapioca and potato starch. Cake - 1 part guar gum, 3 parts albumen, 5 parts white rice flour, and 12 parts potato starch. Bread - 1 part whey powder, 2 parts soy flour and tapioca starch, 3 parts white rice flour"
