While using a salted lemon is the most commonly recommended method for cleaning copper utensils, it may be too corrosive on lighter stains. If you want to be extra careful not to scratch your copper, you can opt to make a paste with lemon juice instead. In a bowl, mix lemon juice and salt in a 3:1 ratio with more lemon juice than salt. The salt will dissolve slightly in the juice, making the solution less coarse against surfaces. Dip a cloth in the solution and use it to clean the copper. Lemons are useful in cleaning for their acidity. If you don't have lemon or lemon juice on hand, vinegar\u2014which is also acidic\u2014is a strong alternative. White vinegar is more acidic than other vinegars, so if you have it, use it. Combine a mixture of 2/3 vinegar and 1/3 salt, dip a cloth in the mixture, and use it to clean the copper."
