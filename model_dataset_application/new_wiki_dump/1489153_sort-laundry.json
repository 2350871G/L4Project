This gives you a chance to make sure that a red sock doesn\u2019t end up coloring your beautiful whites and see if articles have special laundering instructions. Make sure to read the care instructions on each article of clothing the first time you wash it. Look at it again during the sorting process in case you forgot the care instructions or to see if you can put the item with other articles.

          "description":"The first category by which you should sort is color of the items. This can prevent dye transfer problems during washing that often ruin or damage white or lighter colored clothing. Make piles for white, light, and dark clothing. Your white pile should be for articles like socks, underwear, t-shirts and other sturdy white cotton items. The light-colored pile should have colors like pink, lavender, light blue, light green, and yellow. Finally, your dark pile should have gray, black, navy, red, and purple articles. Consider separating out denim into its own pile. You can either wash this as an individual load or together with your dark pile."

          "description":"Chances are that you have items made of different fabrics and textures. Sorting these out after you\u2019ve put the articles in color piles can ensure everything from the quality of your delicates to preventing lint from sticking to certain fabrics. It can also help the drying process go more quickly and evenly. Put any delicates in piles by color. Delicates are items such as lingerie, pantyhose, washable silks and anything that you want to keep from harsh agitation in the washing machine. Segregate items that are \u201clint-givers\u201d and \u201clint-receivers.\u201d For example, you shouldn\u2019t put towels with corduroy articles. Consider sorting out synthetics and natural fibers if you want to run another separate washing cycle. This can further prevent lint transfer. Separate out lighter and heavier weight clothing items. For example, you don\u2019t want to have heavier cotton pants with thin t-shirts. The heavier fabric can damage lighter and more delicate articles by scratching during washing."

These items may require pre-treating stains or washing on a specialty cycle that is too harsh for other articles. In addition, it prevents soils or stains from redepositing on less dirty articles. Pretreat any stains or soils with a stain remover before putting it in washing machine. This can prevent further transfer or redepositing of stains."

For example, items like towels and bedding are often heavier than articles of clothing while newborn or baby clothes are light colors. Creating these type of sub-categories can further protect your clothing and other articles from damage."
