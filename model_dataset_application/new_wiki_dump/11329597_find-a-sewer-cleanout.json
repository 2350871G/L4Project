The planning or county assessor department typically keeps a database of plans and can get you a copy after you request one. Also, check your government\u2019s website to see if these plans are available to the public online. If your home has a cleanout, the plans will display its location whether it\u2019s indoors or outdoors. Subdivision plans could also help. A subdivision plan shows a parcel of land split up into different developments. It is accessible through a government planning office, contractors, and property owners."

          "description":"Due to the way building codes change over the years, some homes don\u2019t have sewer cleanouts. It\u2019s a common problem with very old homes, but new homes sometimes don\u2019t have one either. Call a plumber to confirm the problem. If they aren\u2019t able to find a cleanout, talk to them about getting one installed. A certified plumber can send a small camera down the main sewer line to find out where it branches off into a cleanout. Installing a cleanout is often an inexpensive way to make plumbing maintenance much easier. It can cost as little as $100 USD unless the installer needs to do a lot of excavating inside your home."

If you are unable to find one, it could be because of recent work done near your home. The best people to call are ones that worked outside your home or otherwise came near the sewer line.

Alternatively, talk to any engineering firms that have been involved in planning or constructing your home. Surveyors keep maps of the landscape in your community for legal and safety reasons. They often have access to plot plans. Engineers use plot plans when organizing construction projects. If you dealt with a contractor while improving your home, they may be able to refer you to an engineer they consulted during the project."

In many locations, the concrete will have a big \u201cS\u201d for sewer stamped on it. Once you have found that, the cleanout won\u2019t be far behind.

Remember that the most common locations for the cleanout are along the main sewer or septic line and near bathrooms. It is typically near your home\u2019s foundation. As long as you search those areas, you can find the hidden pipe. In some rare cases, the sewer cleanout may be buried. You will have to dig a little bit in the most likely areas to find it.
