Other factors to consider include the following:\nMake sure the object is lightweight enough to be suspended in gelatin. Heavy objects may simply sink to the bottom. Flowers, small plastic or rubber toys, or fruit that has been carved into a decorative shape are all good options. Use a decoration that is composed of parts that won't fall apart or dissolve when heated. You don't want to choose something made of wood, cloth, or another soft, porous material. The decoration should be somewhat appetizing. Decorative gelatin molds are made to be eaten, and if you want people to enjoy it you should choose a decoration that doesn't put people off. The only exception is if you want to make a gelatin mold as a Halloween decoration; in that case, go crazy with rubber spiders and snakes. Most importantly, choose a decoration that is nontoxic. This is extremely important, since you'll be pouring hot liquid gelatin over the object, which will distribute particles of the item throughout the mold. Fresh flowers and fruit are a safe bet. If you want to use a plastic or rubber toy, choose one that's nontoxic; items that are safe for a baby or toddler to chew on are safe enough to use in a gelatin mold."
