Small new potatoes, which are the first of the season, are flavorful and too small to peel easily. You can leave the peels on any of these types since they won't get in the way of the texture or flavor of your prepared dish. New potatoes are great when prepared simply. Roast the tiny potatoes or steam them gently to preserve their delicious flavor."
