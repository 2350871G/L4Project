          "description":"If it is a nice sunny day, especially one where the sun shines into the room, leave the curtains open for some natural light and heat. The natural light will be good for your baby, and cost you less money than running various heating appliances. If there are tree branches in front of your windows, you can consider  trimming the branches to let more light into the room. Just make sure the trees are on your property, and you aren't cutting down someone else's branches."

          "description":"The temperature in your baby's room should be warm enough for a lightly clothed adult, around 70 to 72 degrees. This will probably be a little bit higher than you have it around the rest of your house, which is okay. Having a thermostat in the baby's room is a good option because it will help to regulate the temperature in the room, and prevent it from getting too warm."

          "headline":"Heat up the room with a space heater.",
          "description":"If you need some heat quickly, say the room is really cold, you can consider using a space heater. If you do use a space heater in the room, make sure it is at least 3 feet away from anything that could burn, and that you turn it off when you leave the room or the baby is sleeping. Make sure that your baby doesn't get near the heater, as it can burn skin very easily."

          "description":"Thermal, or insulating, curtains are another good way to keep warm air in your baby's room. Attach the curtains as close as you can the windows, and let them fall onto the windowsill, or even the floor. Make sure you close them at night to prevent heat from escaping through the window."

          "headline":"Seal the windows.",
          "description":"Leaky windows will let heat escape and cold air in, making your baby's room colder than it needs to be. Plus, you'll be spending extra money on heating as you try to keep the temperature up. Attach weather stripping, caulk, or other sealants to your windows to keep warm air in the room, and drafts out. If possible, you should also replace old, drafty windows with new, sealed ones."

          "headline":"Close the door.",
          "description":"Once you have some way of heating the room, you can help trap the heat in the room by closing the door. This will keep the baby's room particularly warm, especially nice if you like it a little cooler in the rest of the house. You'll also save a little money if you are using a space heater or something similar, as it won't need to work as hard to heat the enclosed area."

For all of these sheets and blankets, remember that they should be tight against the crib and your baby. Loose blankets are dangerous to a sleeping baby. Therefore, you should just have one blanket for your baby's crib. Use a fitted flannel sheet for the crib, especially during the winter. Flannel is a nice, thick material that holds heat well. When using a blanket, make sure you can tuck it into the mattress so that is doesn't come loose, and doesn't make the mattress uneven. Make sure it comes no higher than your baby's armpits."

If that's the case, you can use a hot water bottle, heating pad, or microwaveable bag. Let it sit on the bed for a few minutes to get everything warm. Just remember to remove it before you put your baby down."

Don't be afraid to touch your baby's chest, back, and abdomen to track the temperature. Keep an eye out for the signs of overheating, and if you notice them, remove clothing, turn off heaters, and find other ways to cool down the room. An overheated baby will be damp or moist from sweat, particularly his or her hair, back, and chest. The baby may also have red ears, a rapid pulse, and maybe even a fever."

Always be careful about keeping things away from the baby's head. A good mattress in a playpen is also going to be thin, which is safer for the baby. Your baby's face can get stuck in the extra padding. Softer mattresses can be pressed away from the edges of the crib, which creates gaps with the side of the crib that the baby can get stuck in."

Research is limited on why this is the case, but it is believed that an infant sleeping on his stomach will get less oxygen because he is \u201crebreathing\u201d the air from around the nose."

If you have toys that attach to the side of the crib, make sure they are secure, and don't have any dangling or protruding parts. The child can use these to climb out of the crib, or detach small parts that he might choke on. If your baby is sleeping in another carrier, like a car seat, do not put the carrier into the crib. On an uneven surface like a mattress, the carrier can flip over and hurt your baby. If your baby needs to have his head lifted while sleeping, talk to your doctor or pediatrician about the best ways to accomplish that. If you need to raise the mattress, make sure there are no gaps around the perimeter, and the that angle is low so the baby can't roll off the mattress."

Keep the baby's crib or bed away from corded window coverings, as well as electrical wires for things such as lamps, baby monitors, and night lights. Get cordless equipment whenever possible. If you can't get items without cords, make sure the crib is at least 3 feet away from any cords."
