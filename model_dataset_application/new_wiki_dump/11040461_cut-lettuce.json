Some people hit the stem at an angle against an edge to get the core out."

          "description":"Place half a head with the flat side down on the chopping board. Starting from one edge, move in about 1 inch (2.5 cm) and slice a row. Move across the head, cutting about every 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so. Turn the lettuce so your knife is now perpendicular to the cuts you just made. Repeat the process, cutting across the lettuce every 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so. You'll end up with chunks of chopped lettuce that are about 1 by 1 inch (2.5 by 2.5 cm). Repeat the process with the other half of the lettuce. You can make the rows slightly larger or smaller depending on your preference."

          "description":"Cut a half a head in half again, moving from the top toward the stem end like you did when cutting the head down the center. Place the quarter on the cutting board with a flat side down. You should have one flat part facing out to the side, as well. Set your knife parallel to the long side and move it over the edge of the cabbage just a little bit. Slice down to shred the edge of the lettuce. Keep moving in just a little bit and slicing down until you've shred the whole quarter. The closer you can get to the edge, the thinner the pieces will be. Repeat the process with the other quarters. You can also shred lettuce in a food processor that has a shredding/grating attachment."

If you have a salad spinner, press the top to get all the water out; otherwise, let the lettuce drain thoroughly. Bag it up and push out as much air as you can to store it in the refrigerator. Some people use other methods to store it. For instance, you can try putting it in a sealed container with a paper towel to keep it fresh."

The sharp edge of the knife should be pointing away from the stem. Slide your knife away from the stem, slicing through the lettuce leaves and coming out the top end.

Cut the other side the same way, like you're forming the top 2 sides of a triangle. Then, slice off the top of the triangle by going straight across. Repeat this pattern while you chop the rest of the lettuce. This pattern creates smaller pieces than if you just cut straight across the whole way down."

Take half the head and place it cut-side up on the board. Starting on one of the long edges, roll the lettuce over itself until you have a cylinder. Hold the cylinder in place with your fingers, then begin slicing off one end of the cylinder, making the cuts as finely as you can. Make the same cuts all the way down the cylinder until it's all chopped. This technique allows you to get a better grip on the lettuce. You can also use this technique, called chiffonade, with fresh herbs like basil."
