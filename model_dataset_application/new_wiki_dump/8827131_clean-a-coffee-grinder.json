About once a month, wipe out your coffee grinder with a paper towel or microfiber cloth.

Be sure not to cut yourself on the blades as you wipe down the grinder. Rinse the paper towel and wipe the grinder more than once if necessary.

Poke the wand around the inside of the hopper and around the burrs to remove as much of the coffee dust as possible. If your vacuum has multiple attachments, use the one with the narrowest end that will help you get the nooks and crannies of the grinder. If you want, use a can of compressed air to blow dust out of the grinder instead of sucking it out with a vacuum. If you are in a hurry, or don't have a vacuum or compressed air handy, blow in the grinder a few times to dislodge any leftover grounds. Be careful not to blow anything into your eyes."

Check the manual to find out how to remove the burr. Take out whichever one comes out most easily. If neither one comes out easily, you\u2019ll have to clean them while they are in the grinder.
