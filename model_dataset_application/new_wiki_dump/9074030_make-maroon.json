          "description":"Maroon is primarily made up of red and blue. Yellow is generally then used to add brownish undertones as necessary. Using pure, primary colours generally works best to create new colours. If you're using non-primary colours, do an internet-research or read your paint or dye's container carefully to determine any undertones and see if they are suitable for creating maroon. For example, cadmium red already has yellow undertones. If you mix it with blue, and then add yellow, your paint may come out too light. Rose madder, on the other hand, is a cool red with a blue bias. You will get a violet colour when mixing it with blue, which needs to be adjusted with yellow paint.

Kelly Medford, a plein air painter, says: \u201cIf you\u2019re using primary colors, choose a darker red, like alizarin along with blue and yellow. Once you mix the red and blue, you\u2019ll have purple, which is why you need to mix in yellow to bring the color back to red. If you use a light red, you might not be able to get the mixture of the three colors right.\u201d"

You will need a lot more red to begin, so start mixing colors by adding five parts red for every one part blue. Add small quantities at a time to avoid wasting paint.

A tiny bit of yellow can usually push the initial mixture of red and blue towards the maroon territory. Add just a drop or two of yellow to start and mix it in.

The color you see when you add white is your paint's hue. Pull a small amount of paint aside to test the hue instead of adding white to the whole batch, which could ruin your paint. If your maroon has more of a violet colour than red hue, add some more yellow paint to adjust."
