If you cut back just 3 minutes of your shower time and aim to take 5-minute showers instead, the amount of water you\u2019ll save will really add up. To take 5-minute showers, try one of the following: use a shower timer or set 5 minutes on your phone alarm, listen to a 5-minute song, sing the ABC\u2019s 10 times then stop on M on the 11th time, or count backwards from 300 during your shower."

If you must use pesticides or fertilizers, use them sparingly or check the ingredients to use ones that are made from all-natural ingredients. Or try making your own pesticides out of organic ingredients like neem oil, Epsom salts, or citrus. Make your own neem oil pesticide by mixing 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of neem oil with \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) soap and 32 fluid ounces (0.95 L) of warm water. To make an Epsom salt spray, dissolve 8 fluid ounces (0.24 L) into 5 gallons (19 L) of water. Or simply sprinkle Epsom salts around the bases of your plants instead of making a spray. Citrus is especially effective against aphids. To make a citrus spray, grate the rind from 1 lemon and add it to 16 fluid ounces (0.47 L) boiling water. Allow this to steep overnight then strain the liquid from the lemon rinds. Check to see if the plants you grow need a fertilizer to thrive in your garden before automatically using them."
