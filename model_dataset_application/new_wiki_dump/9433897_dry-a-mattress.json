Disinfect the vacuum nozzle first, as you don\u2019t want to touch your mattress with a nozzle that\u2019s been stuck into cobweb-filled corners of the garage. Simply wipe it with an antibacterial wipe, inside and out, and let it dry."

Then, cover the kitty litter with a towel and firmly press the kitty litter into the mattress. Vacuum up the kitty litter with a wet/dry vacuum. If the mattress is still wet, spread a fresh layer of kitty litter on the mattress and allow it to sit for 1 to 2 hours. Then, vacuum it up."

Be sure to spread plastic sheeting or an old blanket beneath the mattress so it doesn\u2019t get dirty. Sunlight has the added benefit of killing bacteria in your mattress, as well."

Direct the fan at the mattress to increase the air circulation."

If the mattress is soaked, like from a ceiling leak, it\u2019s best to make alternative sleeping arrangements for the night, as it may take up to 24 hours to fully dry. Covering the mattress with sheets and bedding when it\u2019s wet will lead to mold and mildew growth, which is hazardous to your health."
