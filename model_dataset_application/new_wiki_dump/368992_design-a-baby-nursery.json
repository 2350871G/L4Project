This luxury isn't open to every new parent but if you do have time, starting early can ease your concerns about having too much to do. In terms of freedom, realize that there is no one right way to design a nursery other than ensuring that it is safe, warm, and healthy. Begin designing your baby\u2019s nursery in your second trimester. Once you know your baby\u2019s gender (if you decide to find out), you\u2019ll have a better idea of what theme or colors you\u2019d like. While it's fun to use sites like Pinterest to create a dreamboard nursery, be realistic. Time, financial, and space constraints will end up dictating a lot of what you're able to do in the end.

But, keep in mind that it won't matter to the baby whether the area rug matches the curtains. Focus on buying things that are functional first, and beautiful second.

If you don't know the baby's gender, favor neutral colors like cream, yellow, beige, and pale green. You can also center the room around a single idea or you can choose items in a few specific colors. Ideas for themes include nautical, sports, rodeo, ballerina, or jungle. Consider pairing a neutral color and a bright color for your baby\u2019s room, such as yellow and gray, blue and chocolate, or purple and white. For example, paint the walls gray and add pops of color, like red or teal, with area rugs, artwork, or curtains."

This will allow time for the paint or glue to dry before you begin adding furniture. You can add paint or wallpaper to one wall, or all of them. Try to use low VOC (volatile organic compound) paints in your nursery. The chemicals released by standard paints can be harmful to your baby.

Check that all hardware is present and properly installed, including bolts, brackets, and screws. If you live in the U.S., ensure the crib and mattress you choose has met Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) standards. Avoid cribs with drop-down sides which pose safety risks for infants.
