This means using enough glue to connect the parts without leaving too much space between them. The glue forms the strongest bond when there is little to no gap between the parts, and should not act as a filler. The general rule is about one drop per square inch. Be sure to keep some acetone nearby in case you get glue on your hands or an unwanted surface and need to remove it!"

A tight and secure attachment will ensure a strong connection and will speed up the drying process. You can clamp the surfaces together to create a tighter seal and to hold the parts together as the glue dries. The glue will hold after a few minutes, but will take about 24 hours to fully set."

Be sure to move the hairdryer around so as not to overheat an area. A naturally warm environment will also speed up the drying process.

It is also a good practice to have good circulation and ventilation when working with chemicals like super glue as overexposure can lead to nausea, headache, and other negative health effects. You can also use your breath to apply airflow!"

After you apply the super glue, sprinkle a little bit of baking soda and the glue will set almost instantaneously. Be careful when adding baking soda as it will cause the glue to heat up. There are also chemical accelerators that you can find at your local hardware store that will cause the super glue to set quicker."
