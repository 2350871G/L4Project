          "description":"The most common spot will be a strong tree branch that can withstand significant weight (at least 250 pounds (110 kg)). A hardwood tree with healthy horizontal branches will provide the best support. Be sure your location offers 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) of vertical clearance. Oak or maple trees are great hardwood trees to use. Check branches for any splitting or weak and worn points near the trunk. You can use a tape measure to figure out the diameter of your tree branch. Between 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) around should hold your hammock chair. Use a meter or yard stick to measure the distance between the ground and the tree branch. It won\u2019t be exact, but it\u2019ll give you a solid estimate. You can also hang your chair on an overhead beam in a gazebo or on your porch."

          "description":"Spread the rope on the branch to distribute weight. This prevents tension from settling at a single point, weakening that spot and increasing the risk of a break later. Make sure you have enough rope to accommodate height and the knots you\u2019ll tie. With a 15 ft (4.6 m) rope, you\u2019ll have plenty of slack for height adjustments, and you can cut off the excess. However, you can probably get by with 7 feet (2.1 m) of rope."

Hold the rope ends in one hand and use the other to grasp the hammock loop. Slide the loop up, keeping the rope taut. The hammock loop should sit right under the branch or beam."

Pull tight on the left rope. Then repeat, passing the left rope behind the right, then pushing through the new loop created. Pull the knots tight for a strong, tight hold. This ensures the hammock doesn\u2019t fall when used. Use more knots for added security."

Try to put about 50 pounds (23 kg) on the chair. After that, try lightly sitting on it yourself - or have someone else try. Slowly ease onto the chair until you\u2019re fully seated. If it holds still, the chair is solid."
