Visit your local toy, department store, gift shop or dollar store and pick out a stuffed duck you like. Make sure that he/she is soft and cuddly!

      "description":"Once you get home, it's time to name your stuffed duck. Try naming your stuffed duck uniquely. Do not just name it \"Duck.\" You could name your stuffed duck after a character you know, such as Daffy Duck or Jemima Puddleduck, a real person name, such as Annemarie, or a made up name, such as Mr. Quakers Bill."

      "description":"You can make a home for your stuffed duck out of a shoe box with a towel and a doll pillow. If you want, you may purchase an empty doll house to use instead. If you want to make your duck's home lifelike, you can shred up some old newspaper, and put it all together so that it looks like a nest. You may also choose to let it sleep with you on your bed. Real ducks like ponds, consider making your duck a pretend pond."
