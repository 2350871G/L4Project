This will give you enough length of denim to make the folds and will avoid your jeans looking like \u00be pants. If your jeans sit at or above your ankle, it is best to wear these as they are and choose a different pair to peg. Avoid choosing jeans that drag on the floor. Jeans that are too long will make your cuffs too thick and will come undone"
