          "description":"You can reduce the amount of water you waste when you're washing fruits and vegetables by filling a bowl or the sink instead of leaving the water running. Fill the bowl with just enough water to cover the produce, and use a vegetable brush to scrub fruits and veggies clean. When you're finished washing the produce, you can reuse the water to water plants in the house and garden. Running faucets can waste around 4 gallons (15 liters) of water per minute."

          "description":"Some people defrost foods by running cold water over them, but this is very wasteful. Instead, plan ahead and defrost foods in the refrigerator the day before. If you don\u2019t have time for a refrigerator defrost, you can quickly defrost frozen items in the microwave using the defrost setting. Foods should never be thawed at room temperature, in warm water, or in the sun, as this can lead to food-borne illness."

For dishes that require water-based cooking methods, opt for steaming. You don\u2019t need a special appliance for steaming, as long as you have a steamer basket or insert that can be used in a pot. When the steaming process is finished, let the water cool and reuse it to water plants."

When you're done with the cooking water, drain the water into a bowl. Set it aside to cool, and reuse it to:\nBoil other foods\nCook rice and other grains\nMake bread\nMake soups or stocks\nWater plants"

When you're cooking foods like pasta and potatoes, choose the smallest pot possible, and only add enough water to cover the food. To prevent evaporation and the food from drying out, place a lid on the pot during the boiling process, and stir regularly as the food boils."

Instead of buying bottled water, outfit your kitchen tap with a filter if you're concerned about water purity. Fill reusable metal or glass water containers to have water on the go."

Instead of running the water, fill a pitcher with warmer water from your tap and chill it in the refrigerator to get it cold. You can even fill and store your re-useable water containers with warm water and store them in the refrigerator to get the water nice and cold."
