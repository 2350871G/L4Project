          "description":"The tomatoes and mango should both be fully ripe and soft to the touch, but not squishy and bruised. Check near the mango's stem for a small amount of syrup and a mango scent; these are both signs of ripeness. While any varieties of these fruits and vegetables will work, these are the ideal options if available at your local grocery or farmer's market:\nMango: Try to find a non-stringy variety such as Haden and Kent. Tomatoes: Use a small variety such as Roma. Large varieties will make your salsa soggy. Onion: A sweet onion variety such as Vidalia makes a sweet salsa, while red onion adds more kick. Lime or lemon: Lime is preferred, but any variety will do. Bottled lime juice has less punch, but may be a much cheaper alternative in many areas. Chili pepper: If you enjoy spicy salsa, use habanero, cayenne, or Thai chili to provide great contrast with the sweet mango. Otherwise, select a jalape\u00f1o or other relatively mild pepper."

Turn the end piece inside out so the cubes of flesh stick outward, then sever them at the base over a bowl.
