          "description":"Most kits  contain the script, the rules of the game, ideas for costumes, and recipe ideas. Therefore, you should try to include these elements in your own design. If you decide to create your own game, make sure the story is somewhat believable, scary, and interesting. Divide your story up into scenes which can be acted out as the evening progresses. Give each character his or her own backstory that's not only unique, but that also fits in with the clues. Make sure that it is possible to discover the villain by taking note of the clues, asking questions of the other protagonists, and piecing it all together. Although there will be several suspects, of course, only the guilty person should fit the bill."

You can often make use of items you have around the house, like old shoes for making footprints or knives for the murder weapon. Otherwise, thrift shops and garage sales are good places to find props, and are relatively inexpensive, too."

Giving one prize works best to bring out the guests\u2019 competitive instincts, while multiple prizes encourage more wheeling and dealing. Multiple prize ideas include things like best costume, best performance, wealthiest player, and more."

The main reason for this is that it frees the host up to concentrate on the action, knowing that the food is prepared and ready. Plan as many courses as you have scenes in your murder mystery. If you decide to have a full course meal, then either have help with the party or play a lesser character so you won't be overwhelmed."
