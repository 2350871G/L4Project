          "description":"If you\u2019re worried about giving away too much with your eyes, consider wearing dark sunglasses to help maintain your poker face. However, even with sunglasses, try to keep your eyes as still as possible. Movement in your eyes can give away your emotions by triggering muscles on the side of your face."

          "description":"Sometimes, smiling and acting confident, having conversations with your opponents, and putting on the show of being relaxed and easygoing can be just as deceptive as the best poker face. If you act positive, you might also be able to trick your opponents into folding prematurely!"

Remain still and silent in order to throw them off. If that doesn\u2019t work for you, fold your hands together or bring a stress ball and squeeze it constantly."

Put the camera somewhere that\u2019s easy to forget about, to help you relax and display your tics. Play back the video and look for any emotional tells, or ask a friend to guess what cards you had at any point in the video, and take note of what made them think the way they did."

Early position players have to decide whether they want to bet, check, fold, or raise without seeing what the other players are going to do. When you\u2019re sitting in early position, only play the best hands. If you\u2019re in early position, be careful with bluffing or other \u201cfake outs\u201d because you don\u2019t yet have a sense of what the other players have."

While you can play looser in middle position than in early position, remain cautious and don\u2019t try to be too fancy. Unlike early position, where you shouldn\u2019t play anything but the best hands, you can play mediocre hands in middle position, but avoid playing truly awful hands or going for long bluffs. Remember that while you have a sense of the table based on early position, someone in late position could surprise you. Plan accordingly."

Adapt whether or not you bet, call, fold, or check based on what others at the table have done. You can play relatively bad hands in this position. For example, if you\u2019re playing Texas Hold\u2019em and there are only a few low bets on the table and you have a mediocre hand like a pair of 7s, late position is a good place to play that hand. Conversely, you might also want to fold a good hand in late position if you think someone who came earlier is going to beat that hand. If no one at the table has bet, late position players can win by simply betting."
