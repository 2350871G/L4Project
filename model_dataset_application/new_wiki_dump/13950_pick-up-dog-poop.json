          "description":"Although plastic grocery bags are an option if you have no other bags available, it is recommended to use small doggie bags to pick up your dog\u2019s poop. Different types of doggie bags are available at your local pet store. Since picking up poop can be a smelly process, consider purchasing scented doggie bags. Many bags also come with ties that make it easier to close the bag after picking up your dog\u2019s poop. Bring several doggie bags with you each time that you take your dog out for a walk. By doing this, you will be prepared if your dog needs to defecate during the walk. Bio-degradable doggie bags are also available, which are more eco-friendly than regular plastic doggie bags."

          "description":"With your hand safely on the inside of the inverted bag, firmly grab the poop on the ground and pick it up. If you are picking up poop that is on concrete, try to pick it up as cleanly as possible (e.g., not scraping your hand along the concrete as you\u2019re picking up the poop). If the poop is in the grass, make a claw-like circle with your fingers and then get as far under the pile as possible before lifting up the poop. Keep in mind that picking up the poop will be easier if it is solid rather than mushy or diarrhea-like. If you are cleaning up dog poop in your yard, you may need multiple bags, depending on how long it has been since you\u2019ve cleaned up after your dog. If you are out on a walk and either forget or run out of bags, consider going to a nearby store to ask for a bag or disposable cup to pick up your dog\u2019s poop. If you are not near a store, try to find something on the ground that could work, such as a large and sturdy leaf. Make sure that you have a firm grip on your dog\u2019s leash if you are picking up his poop while you are walking him."

There are many types of pooper scoopers available at your local pet store or home gardening store. Scoopers often come with spades (for use on a solid surface), rakes (for use on grass), or grabbers (grasping poop). Try to find a pooper scooper that is sturdy enough to use with one hand. If you are walking with your dog, having a scooper that you can use with one hand would be useful. You can also purchase a pooper scooper that is designed to have a plastic bag attached to the scooper end.

These remnants could attract flies and make it more difficult to pick up your dog\u2019s poop. To keep it clean, you can either hose it down with water or let it soak in a bucket of disinfectant. If you choose to use a bucket with disinfectant, make sure to use this bucket only for cleaning your pooper scooper and not for any other household purposes. Talk with your local waste department for advice on throwing away the water that you used to disinfect your pooper scooper. Do not pour the dirty water into storm drains, since your dog\u2019s feces could contain harmful pathogens (e.g., bacteria, intestinal worms)."
