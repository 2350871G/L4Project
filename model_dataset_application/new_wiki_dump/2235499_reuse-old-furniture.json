Then, place the end of a thin wicker basket in the drawer space so that the basket hangs off the end of the table. Fill this basket with soil and move your plants into it to finish your new planter. If you don\u2019t have any plants, you can also repurpose the old side table as an outdoor drink stand."

Then, add a piece of wood to the middle of the bookcase by attaching it to the sides with screws and a screwdriver. Finally, paint this piece of wood to match the rest of the bookcase. If you want to maximize the amount of vertical storage space in this piece, simply refrain from adding the piece of wood to the middle of it. You can also cut the bookcase into 2 pieces and reuse the top piece as a nightstand."

Finally, add cushioning and pillows to the interior of the tub to create a comfy couch. When you cut the side of the tub, only cut off the straight section of the siding.

Wait 24 hours before putting the furniture back to allow the paint to completely dry. You can also paint furniture made out of metal, wicker, or plastic. Even upholstered furniture can be painted over! If you want your furniture to look extra new, consider painting it an entirely new color. Note that if you choose to do this, you\u2019ll probably have to give it 2 coats to avoid the old color shining through. For furniture that will see heavy use, such as a dining table or any furniture subjected to wear by pets or small children, seal the finish with a durable sealant like polyurethane to better protect it."

You can also paint or polish old accessories to give them a fresher look instead of completely replacing them. You can also consider adding new doors or shelves to an existing piece of furniture to hide or organize bothersome clutter. Feel free to add accessories to furniture to give it a new purpose.
