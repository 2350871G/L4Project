      "description":"When selecting your wooden spoon, always look for those made from hardwood, such as teak. These spoons will be stronger and more durable than ones made from pine or other softwoods. Softwood wooden spoons will crack, split, and can absorb aroma and moisture easily. Spoons that become taunted with strong flavors, such as garlic, can ruin a delicately flavored dish, or even a drink like lemonade. If you're not sure what type of wood the spoon is made of, ask. A good retailer will be able to tell you and understand why you're asking. Think about supporting a local craftsperson who make such spoons; they will undoubtedly use quality hardwood, the finishing will be lovelier than mass-produced ones, and you'll be helping to keep their craft alive."
