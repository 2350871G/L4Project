  "text":" Hang the Border Measure the quilt. You will need precise measurements for your quilt to determine how big the wallpaper frame needs to be. Measurements that are too short will create excess room in the frame, while measurements that are too long will cause the quilt to overlap onto the wallpaper border. Cut four strips of wallpaper border. Take the width of the border and add twice that amount the length of your quilt sides to determine the length of your strips. For example, if the wallpaper border is 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick and the quilt sides are each 24 inches (61 cm) long, each strip should be about 30 inches (76.2 cm) long. Angle the ends of each strip. In order to create a frame, the bottom or inside edge of each strip of border must be shorter than the outside edge. Cut into the edge of the strip at a 45 degree angle. The shorter inside edge should match the length of the quilt side it will frame, with 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of excess space. Draw a frame on the wall. Use a straight edge or a level to keep the border straight and draw the line lightly with a pencil. The sides of the frame should match the length of each side of the quilt. Prepare the wallpaper border. Wallpaper border comes pre-pasted and unpasted. Soak rolled up pre-pasted paper, pattern side in, in a tray of lukewarm water. Lay unpasted paper flat, pattern side down, and apply paste to the back. Work from the inside out toward the edges. Position the first strip on the wall. Match the inside corner of the border to the corner of the pencil line frame. Lay out the border on the wall. Flatten the strip of wallpaper border on the wall, keeping the bottom edge even with the pencil line. Use a smoothing brush after flattening it to remove any bubbles beneath the paper. Position and flatten the next strip of paper on the wall. The bottom inside corner should match the corner of the pencil line frame. Some paper should overlap onto the first strip. Flatten the border out in the same way you flattened the first. Repeat the positioning and flattening procedures with the remaining two pieces. Each corner should have about 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of overlap. Cut away the overlap at the corners. Use a sharp razor to carefully slice away the overlap without cutting through the bottom layer of paper. Let dry. The wallpaper frame should be complete, but you should let it dry before attempting to hang the quilt. Hang the Quilt Cut four pieces of self-adhesive Velcro. The width of the Velcro should be pre-set at 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) and you should cut lengths of about 2 inches (5 cm) for a 36 by 36 inch (1 by 1 meter) quilt. You may need to make the pieces shorter or longer depending on the size of your quilt, however. Stick one side of each Velcro strip in each corner of the quilt. Place the corner of the strip 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) down and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) over. Stitch the Velcro in place. Even though the self-adhesive Velcro should stay on the quilt by itself, a quick stitch will give it extra support. Stick the other side of each Velcro strip on the wall. The strips should be on the inside of the wallpaper frame, about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) in and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) down to match the location of the strips on the quilt. Align the Velcro and stick together. The Velcro pieces should be evenly aligned, and the quilt should fit perfectly inside the wallpaper border.",
