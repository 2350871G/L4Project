Firmly tap the egg at one of its ends with a teaspoon or bread knife to create a small crack. Then you can peel off the shell carefully either as you eat, or all in one go. Cracking the eggs at the end rather than in the centre will reduce the chance of damaging the egg white. If there are any small pieces of shell leftover after peeling, you can dunk the whole egg in an ice water bath to get rid of these."

The egg cup will keep your egg steady and upright if you want to take the shell off as your eat, rather than all in one go. You can then use a spoon to eat the egg straight out of the shell. An egg cup is a small cup which holds the egg upright for you to eat. You can buy these from homeware stores or online."

You can keep it simple with buttering the bread and roughly smearing the eggs on top. A popular way for kids to enjoy soft boiled eggs is to make toast soldiers. In an egg cup, crack the top off a soft boiled egg, and then dip strips of thinly sliced toast into the slightly gooey center. Avocado on toast with soft boiled eggs is also a delicious meal. Mash 1 avocado with a salt and pepper to taste until the mixture is smooth. Then, spread the avocado on top of two slices of toast. Place half of a soft boiled egg on each, and enjoy!"

Cut each egg in half first, and then sprinkle or dip each half into different herbs, spices, or seeds. You can also roll whole eggs in seasoning mixes if preferred. For a chili flavor, combine 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (18 g) of table salt, a pinch of ground chili, and a pinch of ground white pepper. For a simple seasoning, mix together 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (18 g) of table salt with 1/2 tsp (2 g) of finely grated lemon rind. For a classic savoury taste, combine 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (18 g) of table salt, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (3 g) of finely chopped fresh chives, and a pinch of ground white pepper."
