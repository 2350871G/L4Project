It is important to note that you can only flip for the first 1.5 seconds that you have been in the air. After 1.5 seconds you will have to land completely in order to flip again. To refresh your ability to flip, you may land on any surface including the floor, walls, ceiling, or even onto the ball itself so long as all four wheels make contact with the surface."

You can slow down by releasing the accelerator, holding reverse, or power sliding. Power sliding is advantageous in that it allows you to quickly pivot to face another direction."

If no such opportunity exists, you should rotate back to your goal in order to acquire more boost and to provide defense should the other team take control of the ball."
