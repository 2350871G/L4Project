Anything more abrasive can scratch the surface of your sink. You also may want to wear dish gloves while cleaning. Read your manufacturer's instructions to select a cleaning agent. Stainless steel sinks are all made from slightly different materials. These materials respond differently to different types of cleaning products. To make sure you choose the right product for your sink, it's best to defer to manufacturer's instructions in regards to care, cleaning, and general maintenance. In the absence of instructions, use your best judgement and select a cleaning product recommended by manufactures and manufacturer's agencies in regards to stainless steel sink care. Products frequently recommended for a stainless steel sink are Fantastik Antibacterial Heavy Duty, Formula 409 Antibacterial All Purpose, Windex, Bar Keeper's Friend and Soft Cleanser, and stainless steel cleaner and polish."

Non-brush stainless steel may not respond well to sandpaper. If you rent, you may want to ask your landlord to repair the sink. If you cause further damage, you may be fined.
