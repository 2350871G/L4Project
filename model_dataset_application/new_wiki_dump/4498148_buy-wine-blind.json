      "description":"Each person has a preference for how much of each they prefer in their wine. This preference is called your palate style. In order to find yours, go to the store (or wine bar) and buy (or ask for a taste of) three wines of radically different variations. For instance, if you like white wine choose a Riesling, a Chardonnay, and a Pinot grigio. Red wine lovers might choose a Chianti, a Merlot, and a classic (light) Pinot noir. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2a\\/Buy-Wine-Blind-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Buy-Wine-Blind-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2a\\/Buy-Wine-Blind-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Buy-Wine-Blind-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nDraw yourself a \"one through ten\" chart for each of the four basic descriptions and label them. Make sure you have one full chart for each wine. As you taste each wine, rate each one with what you feel they have of each of the descriptions. You are not rating what you like, yet. You are just deciding how much of each thing the wines have. One would be almost none (if any), and ten, an enormous amount. A typical Pinot grigio might have a three to six for fruit, an eight to ten for acid, a two to four for oak, and a two for tannin. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b5\\/Buy-Wine-Blind-Step-2Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Buy-Wine-Blind-Step-2Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b5\\/Buy-Wine-Blind-Step-2Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Buy-Wine-Blind-Step-2Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nWhen you finish the charts, you can begin to sort out how much of these individual descriptions you like in each wine. A red wine person might decide that they like a medium tannin, a high fruit, a medium oak, and a low acid. In this case, Merlot and other soft, lush varietals or blends might be your personal favorites. A white wine drinker could choose a medium fruit, a medium oak, a medium acid and a low tannin. They might go for a nice California Chardonnay. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2e\\/Buy-Wine-Blind-Step-2Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Buy-Wine-Blind-Step-2Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/2e\\/Buy-Wine-Blind-Step-2Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Buy-Wine-Blind-Step-2Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nDo not be surprised if, in your wine adventures, you find yourself liking something that sneaks in from outside of your box.
