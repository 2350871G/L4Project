To flip a pancake, slide a spatula all the way under and lift it away from the hot pan. With a single turning motion of the wrist, flip the pancake over and let the uncooked side hit the hot pan.

You may need to compensate for the extra liquid by adding a small amount of extra flour. Try adding it 1/8 of a cup at a time until you achieve a good consistency. To zest a lemon, use a fine grater or microplane to grate the outer layer of the peel into your mixing bowl. You won't need much \u2014 if the peel gets white, you're going too far. Simple syrup with lemon juice makes a great syrupy condiment for this dish."

These pancakes aren't sweet, but they taste great with a little butter or olive oil. Salty fish (like whitebait) also make great companions. If you like spice, try adding a little red pepper to the batter with the vegetables. Plain greek yogurt is a great side in this case \u2014 its rich smoothness counteracts the spice."

Just substitute gluten-free flour for all-purpose flour in the \"Basic Pancakes\" recipe above. The taste and texture may be very slightly different, but you may even prefer these differences. There are many kinds of gluten-free flour available. Examples include buckwheat and almond flour. Try checking your local health food store or specialty grocer if you're not sure where to buy gluten-free flour."
