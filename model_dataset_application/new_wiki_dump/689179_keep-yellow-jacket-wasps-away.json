Each container should have a sturdy lid that closes firmly to keep pests out. Garbage dumpsters should have heavy, swinging doors that are kept closed at all times. Avoid letting your garbage pile up too much in outdoor bins, as you will be unable to close them properly if they are too full. Buy multiple bins if necessary."

Use a caulking gun to fill gaps, holes, or cracks around the perimeter. Position the gun at a 45-degree angle and squeeze the trigger to distribute a thick stream of caulking into the spots you are filling. Acrylic caulking is suitable for holes smaller than 0.25 inches (0.64 cm), while holes larger than 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) should be filled with polyurethane caulking. Infestations of yellow jackets into your home will most likely require the expertise of a professional exterminator."

You can prevent this development by looking for small nests that may be hanging under awnings, railings, doorways, or nooks outside your home. Knock down the nests with gloved hands or a large stick and promptly step on them to kill the egg cells inside. The queen is usually the only mobile resident of her nests in the late spring and early summer. Once nests are larger and worker wasps start emerging from them, it will be too dangerous to destroy them this way. Yellow jacket nests are round, paper-like, and have a small entranceway at the bottom."

Gently brush the pesticide around the entrance hole on the bottom of the nest, being careful not to clog it..\nAvoid shaking the nest, as it may prompt the wasps to attack. The yellow jackets will collect the pesticide on their bodies as they leave and enter the nest, and then ingest it when they groom themselves.
