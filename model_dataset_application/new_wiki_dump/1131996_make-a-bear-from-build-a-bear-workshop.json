There should only be one hole in its back, which should have a string on it. This is where the stuffing will go."

      "description":"If there is a line, wait in it. There should be a person waiting. He/she will ask you to step on the pedal while the person will stuff the bear. Once finished, grab a heart and place it inside the bear. The person will string the back together completely. Optionally, you can pick out a sound before you string it completely. Go to the sound station, and push the buttons to hear the different sounds. Then search for the drawer with the sound number, and pick a sound device up. Hand it to the assistant when the bear is stuffed."
