          "description":"By leaving the actual sale to professionals, you increase your chances of successfully selling the dress to someone. The downside to using consignment stores, however, is that half of the money you make from selling the dress goes to them. If increasing the odds of selling the dress are more important to you than making money, consignment stores are the way to go. Wedding dresses come and go out of fashion fairly quickly. To increase your chances even further, try to keep your dress in excellent condition and sell it within 2 1/2 years of when you first bought it. A used gown that is in great condition can expect to make a little more than half of what you originally paid for it."

Your ad should grab a buyer\u2019s attention, hold their interest, and make them want to buy  it. Emphasize the excellent condition of your dress and how much you loved it on your day. If you purchased it from a well known designer, be sure to use their name in your ad. Be fair when setting your price. No matter how appealing your ad is, no one will buy your dress if the price is too high. Browse the market to see how much similar dresses are selling for and set your price accordingly."

Take some lace or satin from your dress and overlay the cover of your wedding photo album with it. Trinkets like a pendant necklace.

Fashionable scarves can be made from longer portions of your dress while smaller pieces could be attached to hair bands or left as handkerchiefs. Stuffed animals or a bassinet for future children. The skirt of your dress can be trimmed and hung around a crib or you can trace out a stuffed animal pattern and cut that out instead."
