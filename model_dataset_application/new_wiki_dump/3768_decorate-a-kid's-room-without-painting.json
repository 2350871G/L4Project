Another method is to hang blank sheets from ceiling to floor like wallpaper and let your child 'body paint'  right onto the wall. This can be messy and have unpredictable results, though."

The best part of fun activity for the whole family, as long as you don't mind getting a little messy yourself. Make hand prints, footprints, and splatters. It's like coloring the walls, but without the parental wrath and permanent damage."
