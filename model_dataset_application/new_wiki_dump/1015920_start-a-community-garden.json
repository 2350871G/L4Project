Consider capping the group at about twenty families. There\u2019s no set size for a community garden. Generally, single-family plots measure about 10 by 15 feet (3.0 by 4.6 m). If you have twenty families with plots, then, you need a minimum space of 3,000 square feet (278.7 \u33a1). Most community gardens are at least 2,000 to 5,000 square feet (185.8-464.5 \u33a1).

Group members should visit the garden frequently to water their plots. During the harvest seasons of your various vegetable plants, they\u2019ll also need to regularly collect vegetables. They should also remove weeds and deadhead the plants. Group members will need to decide how often they\u2019d like to visit their plots. During hot weather, they\u2019ll likely need to stop by each day or at least every other day. In the off-season, they can probably visit just once every week or so. If individual families aren\u2019t taking care of their plots, ask if they\u2019d like a different family to take it over. Establish a watering and weeding schedule for shared plots. Rotate the care of community plots among your members, assigning these spaces to one family for one to two weeks at a time. Start the schedule over once you\u2019ve gone through the entire group. You may also want to make one person (such as the president) responsible for visiting the garden at least once per week to check on these shared areas. Use composting, recycling, and trash bins to manage waste. Set up a group meeting to make sure everyone knows how to compost and recycle. Be very clear about what materials should and shouldn\u2019t be composted, as you\u2019ll be using the compost to regularly enrich your soil. You shouldn\u2019t compost diseased plants, meat or milk products, or animal waste. These could all prevent your compost from producing the good bacteria that you want in there. Use caution when composting weeds. Check to make sure they haven\u2019t developed seeds that could corrupt your compost pile (such as when a yellow dandelion becomes a white puffball). If you do end up with seeded weeds in your compost, ensure that the pile heats up enough to break them down by turning the compost at least once per week. Use an email list to keep in touch with the group. Major email services, including Gmail, will allow you to easily set up a mailing list. The president or another garden group member should send out a message at least once a month. Include community updates, growing guides for the season, event announcements, and any other communications you need to share. Regular communication will keep the group connected. After all, that\u2019s what a community garden is all about! Share community meals in the garden once a year. During the harvest season, use the vegetables and herbs you\u2019ve grown to make a delicious meal. You can also invite people from the neighborhood who don\u2019t belong to the garden group. This is a great way to demonstrate the value and purpose of your garden. Invite guest speakers to talk about gardening and the environment. Get in touch with a local gardening store or community college. See if there are gardeners, horticulturalists, landscapers, or environmental scientists who\u2019d be willing to talk to your garden group. This could be a fun way for your group to hang out while also increasing your gardening expertise! Potential topics could include sustainable gardening, pest and weed control, or garden management. You could also contact a local chef to see if they\u2019d be willing to trade some locally grown vegetables for a cooking lesson!",
