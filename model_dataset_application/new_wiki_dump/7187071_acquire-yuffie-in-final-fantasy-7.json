      "description":"In order to do this, you need to do the motorcycle mission without letting Cloud or the other Party members die. After that, there will be yet another boss fight with yet another big robot. Try tackling this using Cloud with restore and an offensive magic (since he has not yet unlocked any better weapons), Barret with Lightning and Elemental Materia on his weapon, so his attacks are counted as super effective against robots (also helpful in the Elevator Battle), and Red XIII with whatever magic you have. After that you will be out of Midgar and in the World Map."
