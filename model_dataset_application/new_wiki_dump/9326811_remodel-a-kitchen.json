          "description":"Take some time to come up with the ways you want to improve your current kitchen. One of the most important questions is if you have enough space. You may need to add onto your kitchen. After settling on space, pick out the kitchen features you absolutely have to have. For example, your dream kitchen may feature an island cooktop instead of a traditional stove. Save pictures of kitchens you like. Use them to identify features you want in your ideal kitchen."

          "headline":"Come up with a preliminary budget.",
          "description":"Decide upon a maximum amount of money you\u2019re willing to invest in the remodel. As you plan your kitchen, do some research to find out how your plans fit your budget. You can do this by searching for furniture estimates online, visiting furniture showrooms, and talking to designers and contractors. Most of the time, remodeling costs more than you\u2019d expect, so you\u2019ll need to alter your plans or budget. The biggest priority is getting the layout and utilities right. Cabinets and countertops are the next part. These will comprise most of your biggest expenses. Don\u2019t forget to add in designer and contractor costs."

A complete sketch shows you how much space you have to work with. You may need to opt for smaller appliances, counters, and cabinets in order to maintain enough free space in the kitchen. Keep in mind where your utility lines are going to be. Electrical outlets, plumbing, and gas lines all affect the arrangement. To save money, have the contractor keep them where they are now."

          "headline":"Determine the kitchen\u2019s style.",
          "description":"Most likely you have an idea of how you want the kitchen to look. Perhaps you want your kitchen to look modern instead of traditional. It could be all wood, or it could incorporate a color theme. Picking a style means focusing on the overall look of the kitchen rather than its parts. For example, a kitchen with a modern style might have a black, gray, or white color scheme with a lot of reflective surfaces and marble walls. The appliances can be metallic and the furniture can look very sleek and minimal. A cottage kitchen could have checkered light blue or yellow patterns, vintage or white appliances, wood floors, and colorful decorations. For a farmhouse kitchen, wood flooring and furniture works well. The color scheme can include red, yellow, blue or white. Stone and brick appliances can also give a rustic look. A French or Mediterranean kitchen looks very ornate. It can feature warm colors with white or yellow walls and wood cabinets. It might have hand-painted wall tiles, a chandelier, copper pots, or ceramic crafts on display."

Kitchen designers and architects can help you finalize your remodeling plans while staying within your budget. Construction contractors provide outlines for structural and utility work. You\u2019ll need these plans to apply for building permits."

Get estimates from at least three companies. Each contractor should talk to you about your design plans and give you an estimate. Use the estimate to figure out if you need to change your plans to stay under budget. Search the contractor\u2019s name online to find reviews from other customers."

If your remodeling plan includes building or demolishing walls, window openings, or utility lines, you\u2019ll most likely need a permit. Designers, architects, and contractors can take care of this."

Remove light fixtures and other furniture you don\u2019t plan on including in your new kitchen. If you haven\u2019t hired a contractor yet, doing this on your own saves you some money.
