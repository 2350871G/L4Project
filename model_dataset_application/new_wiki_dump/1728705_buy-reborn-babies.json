Some are created from awake kits (eyes open), and some with asleep kits (eyes closed). You can also decide what size kit you want, because there are options for preemies, newborns, or bigger dolls. A simple google search of \u201creborn baby kits\u201d should lead you to websites that describe different kits. Different artists are willing to do different things. Some artists don\u2019t root hair, for example, because it is too time consuming, so if you care about rooted hair you\u2019ll want to find a different artist."

The cheapest options might be tempting, but check that they are not just factory-made dolls. Some dolls called \u201creborn\u201d online are really just marked up, cheap baby dolls."

This way, you can verify that they in fact still have the doll and aren\u2019t scamming you with old pictures. Of course, it is possible for people to fake these safety pictures, but it will help weed out unethical sellers.
