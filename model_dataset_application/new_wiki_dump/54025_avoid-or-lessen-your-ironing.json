  "text":" Caring for Your Clothes Iron the essentials only. Instead of ironing everything, try only ironing your actual clothes. Things like underwear, bedding, and towels may never need to be ironed. Go through your ironing pile and remove anything that isn't wrinkled clothes. Buy clothes in synthetic or blended fabrics.

Many clothes become wrinkled because they were stuffed into overfilled drawers or closets, or thrown on the floor.

Forcing too many clothes into the washer or dryer presses them together, putting pressure on the garments and creating wrinkles that the dryer can\u2019t remove. Read the manual to determine the ideal load before you start doing laundry. Separate light and heavy clothes in the washing machine. Wash and dry heavy clothes like jeans and jackets together instead of mixing them with lighter clothes. Tank tops, light dresses, and button-up shirts are much lighter and can have wrinkles pressed into them by heavier garments lying on top of them. Use the dryer\u2019s permanent press setting.

This prevents them from settling and wrinkling in the dryer or in the basket. Set a timer to make sure you\u2019re able to take them out and fold or hang them up immediately. Removing Wrinkles Quickly with the Dryer Put the item and a damp washcloth in the dryer. If you have one article of clothing that needs to be ironed, you can often get the wrinkles out in the dryer instead. Take a damp washcloth and put it and your item in the dryer. Set the dryer to permanent press. Don't use the \"normal\" setting on your dryer. Always use the permanent press setting if you want to use your dryer to remove wrinkles. Check the settings before you start the cycle. Remove the item after 10-20 minutes. Too much heat for too long can set creases, so be sure to pull your item out of the dryer after about 10-20 minutes. Fold it, hang it up, or put it on right away. Getting Rid of Wrinkles with Steam Buy a garment steamer. If you have a few items that always need to be ironed, try buying a garment steamer. Steaming takes about a quarter of the time ironing does and is a great option for large or special items that need to be pressed. Fill the steamer and turn it on. Garment steamers have different water capacities depending on their size, so check your steamer's instructions before filling it. Don't fill it up beyond the maximum fill level--this can cause a leak that can damage your steamer. Put the item on a hanger. Get a hanger and put the item that needs to be ironed on it so that it's hanging upright. Most hangers will be fine, but avoid using hangers made of wood or that have cloth coverings--steam and water can damage them or leave marks on your clothes. If you're trying to steam curtains, leave them on the rod. You can use a garment rack, door sill, curtain rod, or anything that gets your item hanging vertically.

Gently run the steamer head across the wrinkled areas until there are none left. Don't press it too hard against the garment--just hold it against the fabric and gently move it downward. Hang your clothes in the shower. You can hang up clothes on the shower bar to steam while you're taking a hot shower. This is less effective than using a steamer or dryer, but you'll be able to get some wrinkles out.",
