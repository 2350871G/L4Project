          "description":"Before storing your stuffed animals for long periods, it\u2019s a good idea to clean them first. But before cleaning them, you want to make sure that any rips or tears are repaired so that the animal doesn\u2019t get destroyed during the cleaning process. Take a needle and thread that\u2019s as close to the color of the animal as you can get. Thread the needle and tie a knot it one end of the thread. Starting at one end of the rip, push the needle up through the underside of the rip to lock the thread in place on the underside of the fabric. Then use the needle to push the thread from the material on one side of the rip to the other in a straight line. Move down and make another stitch. Continue making slip stitches like this until the rip is repaired. Don\u2019t forget to sew and secure eyes, bows, and other features back on if they\u2019ve fallen off."

          "description":"To remove dust, dirt, mites, allergens, and other particles from the stuffed animals, you want to vacuum them periodically, and always before they go into storage. Place several medium to large sized stuffed animals in a large garbage bag. Insert the nozzle of a vacuum cleaner into the bag and seal the bag around the nozzle. Turn on the vacuum cleaner and let it suck out all the air, dust, and dirt. When you're finished, you may need to re-fluff the animals if the stuffing has lost some shape in the process. To vacuum smaller toys, hold them in your hand an use a nozzle attachment of the appropriate size to suck up dirt and dust."

          "description":"Depending on how old or delicate your animals are, you may be able to machine wash or hand wash them, or you can clean them with baking soda. Check the care labels on the animals before choosing which method to use. For machine washable toys, place individual animals in mesh laundry bags or stuff them into pillow cases to protect them from snags. Wash them on the delicate or hand wash cycle if it\u2019s available, and use a mild detergent and cold water. To hand wash animals, fill a sink with cool water and add one tablespoon (15 ml) of mild laundry detergent. Immerse the toy in the water and gently agitate the water and rub the fur to remove dirt. Rinse in a fresh sink of clean water to remove the excess detergent. To clean animals with baking soda, place one animal at a time in a plastic bag or pillow case. Depending on the size of the animal, use one tablespoon (15 g) to one-quarter cup (60 g) of baking soda to cover the animal with a light dusting. Close the bag and give it a good shake. Let the animal sit in the baking soda for half an hour, and then use a damp towel to wipe off dirt and excess baking soda."

To dry the animals, you can:\nHang them on a clothesline in the sun. This is ideal for all toys, but it\u2019s especially important for older toys that may be flammable and can't go in the dryer. Let them air dry on a towel. Make sure you turn them over periodically so the air can reach all the sides. Be sure the animals are completely dry before storing them. Put dryer-safe animals in the dryer. Use a low-heat setting and add a few towels to the load to help protect the animals from the tumbling."

Built-in or bookshelves are a great way to get animals off the floor and display them, and if the shelves are low enough, your child will still be able to access all his/her favorite toys. Be sure to dust and rearrange toys often when they\u2019re displayed like this, as dust, dander, and allergens settle quickly on immobile toys.

For a small animal pen, you can use a large basket with wide spaces between the bars.
