  "text":" Using a Light Bulb and Water Make sure you have safety equipment before trying this method. You'll need strong gloves, eye safety glasses and a non-slip surface to work on. Grab an old light bulb that isn't useful for working with anymore. Using a chisel, chisel out a small hole in the cap sleeve via the electrical connector, in such a way that you can see down into the glass bulb. If the glass needs clearing, pour in a bit of hot water, and when you shake it, the white coating will come right out. This is not necessary for already clear light bulbs. After you rinse it a few times, you should have a crystal clear bulb. Fill the light bulb with water.  Cap the bottom with a balloon (or something similar). You've just created a makeshift magnifying glass. Go ahead and use your \"magnifying glass\". To use it, focus the sun through the magnifying glass and onto a piece of paper (or wood); it should start smoking, and a minute later, burst into flames. Transfer the paper to pre-prepared kindling in a suitable fire pit and you'll soon have a campfire to be proud of. Using a Dish and Water Find a small bowl and line it with clear plastic wrap.  Fill the bowl with water until it is nearly full. Then, gather each of the plastic corners of the top. This will form a little liquid pouch. By twisting the corners together, you can seal the water inside. Use your \"water pouch\" to focus the sun on a dark piece of paper. It should start smoking, then ignite into a flame and you can transfer the burning paper to your fire. Using a Picture Frame and Water Take a picture frame and cover it in clear plastic wrap.  Suspend the picture frame on something that is located a couple of feet off the ground. Cinder blocks are good; stack two a few feet from each other. Pour some hot water on the plastic. It will begin to sag, forming a natural, effective liquid lens. Gather up something you can use as tinder and hold over the fire pit.  Find the focal point of the beam to concentrate the heat. When the tinder starts smoldering, set it down in the fire pit, in such a way that it rests in the beam. Now you can sit back and watch the elements ignite the fire for you, completely hands free. Using a Juice Bottle and Water Find a juice bottle that looks like a giant plastic bubble. Fill it with water. Position the liquid-filled bubble between the sun and the tinder pile, until you find the spot where it starts smoking. Keep everything still, enabling the heat to continue to build.
