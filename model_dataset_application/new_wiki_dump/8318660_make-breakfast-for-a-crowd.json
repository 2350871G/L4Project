This is important, as you won\u2019t be able to proceed without knowing how many people you are cooking for. Ask the organizer. The organizer of the event should be able to give you the number of guests. If you\u2019re the organizer, make sure your invitation is clear that people need to give you notice of if they\u2019ll be there. In addition, they should let you know if they will bring guests. Give people at least a week notice to respond. You should have guest information at least three days before the breakfast \u2013 to provide you with time to shop and prepare the meal."

This is important, as you want to make sure there is more than enough food for everyone to eat. In the end, you don\u2019t want people walking away hungry. You may have unplanned visitors or people may take more food than you anticipate. Generally, provide about half a pound of food for every person. This may vary based on different dishes. One dish may be a lot more popular than you think. Some people may like your egg and bacon casserole a lot more than the spinach and tomato omelet. To avoid this, test dishes out ahead of time or cook more of dishes you think will be popular."

Consider a casserole. Include your choice of ingredients such as eggs, meat, and vegetables. Remember, though, if you prepare an egg, cheese, and sausage casserole, you may want to balance it out with a vegetable casserole. Serve eggs and bacon as an entr\u00e9e.
