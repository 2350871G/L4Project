Assault are equipped with powerful weapons, grenade launchers and can give ammo to their team mates. Recon is an effective class if you wish to snipe. They can hide in scenery unnoticed, plant C4s on enemy Tanks and have one shot kill snipers at their disposal. Medics can revive fallen team mates, heal themselves and their team. Engineer can repair vehicles and they have a RPG. Pick a suitable for you class and stick with it."

Use your classes special abilities to assist each other and try to assist in kills. You'll get points for just shooting the enemy once before your teammate kills them."

          "headline":"Master vehicles.",
          "description":"Vehicles are not found in Squad deathmatch (only 1 tank per squad deathmatch map). Otherwise, vehicles can be found easily and used effectively. In one team versus one team battles, you will find vehicles docked at your base, or if you are an engineer, you can repair broken vehicles. With vehicles you can use them in first person or you can adjust it to third person, multiple people can use a vehicle, and the additional players control a turret on the vehicle (if there is one) or they need to get transported quickly. Whilst using a tank, try to keep your reflexes high as when fired from behind you get damaged more, try destroying enemies cover and using Destruction 2.0. sea vehicles are uncommon and should be used as defensive and not offensive. Use air vehicles to bomb the enemy and destroy their air vehicles. Light vehicles like motorcycles can be used to quickly carry you and your team mates somewhere."

In conquest its 12 vs 12, you need to capture the control points and hold them as long as you can. In rush its 4 vs 4 players in battle for exploding devices, you need to detonate them  before they explode or set them up. One team will be on offensive and the other on defensive. Squad rush is 12 vs 12 players in a tighter version of Rush. All modes can be played in a hardcore mode which is very hard."

But if you win you get more XP.
