          "description":"The best way to prevent weevils from getting into your home is to avoid buying food that\u2019s infested with them. To do this, you have to be able to identify weevils. Both rice and granary weevils have divided bodies made up of a head, thorax, and abdomen. Each species ranges from one-eighth inch (3.2 mm) to three-sixteenth inches (4.8 mm) long. Rice weevils are a dull red-brown and can fly. They're usually found in slightly warmer climates. They also have four lighter spots on their bodies. Granary weevils are a shiny red-brown, they cannot fly, and they're usually found in slightly cooler climates."

Luckily, you can prevent an infestation by killing the weevils before the eggs hatch or the females lay eggs. There are two ways you can do this:\nHeating: This works best for whole grains (rice, for instance), but shouldn\u2019t be used for ground grains or powders. Heat your oven to 140 F (60 C). Lay your grains out on a baking sheet. Bake the grains in the oven for 15 minutes. Allow to cool before storing. Freezing: This is suitable for powdered and ground grains, but also works for whole grains. Simply place the newly purchased bag or container of grains in the freezer and leave it undisturbed for three days. Allow to thaw before storing."

Scott McCombe\t\t\tPest Control Specialist\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Keep grains, flour, and pet food in hermetically sealed containers, and throw out unused, expired products rather than storing them. Also, regularly look through your storage bins, pantry, and containers to look for signs of infestation. In addition, clean up any spills quickly, including cracks and crevices, and clean under your refrigerator and stove at least once a month."
