  "text":" Making the Dough Mix all the dry ingredients for the cookie base in a bowl.  Add the eggs and butter to the dry ingredients mixture.  Take the dough out of the bowl once it comes together and form it into a disc shape.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap. Refrigerate it for at least 1 hour. Shaping the Cookies Roll the chilled dough out on a clean surface lightly dusted with flour. You want to roll it out to about 1/8\"/3mm in thickness. Flour your cookie cutter so that the dough doesn't stick to it. If you're using an inverted glass, flour the rim of it instead. Cut out small rounds of dough and place each cookie base onto your prepared cookie sheet.  Baking the Cookies Bake the cookies for 10 minutes, or until they turn a light golden brown.  Cool the cookie crusts to room temperature after you take them out of the oven.  Adding the Marshmallow Filling and Chocolate Coating Use a piping bag to pipe a small dab of marshmallow filling onto the center of the cookies.  Top the filling with the other half of the cookies to make cookie sandwiches.  Allow the filling to set for two hours. In the meantime, you can work on preparing the chocolate coating in a bowl. Lower the cookie sandwiches into the chocolate.  Remove the cookies with a fork, when you see they are completely covered in chocolate.  Let the excess chocolate drip back into the chocolate pan.  Place the cookie back on your prepared baking sheet.  Allow the cookies to set to room temperature. Be sure that the coating is completely firm before moving it onto your serving plate. Serve the cookies at your next garden party or barbecue. ",
