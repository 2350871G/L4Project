          "description":"You can polish any stone you wish, but there are certain characteristics of a stone that will make it easier to polish. If you want an easy stone to polish, pick a somewhat softer stone like onyx, limestone or calcite. Stones that are very hard will take a much longer time to polish. However, though hard rocks take a long time to sand, they yield more shine than softer rocks. To tell if a stone is soft, scratch it with another rock. If the scratch looks chalky, the stone is soft. Also try to pick a rock with a roundish shape, without major protrusions or indentations."

          "headline":"Shape the rock.",
          "description":"If you want your rock to be rounder, use a small hammer or a chisel to chip away at the stone. Put on safety glasses to protect your eyes from chipped off rock, and wear safety gloves if you wish. Chip at any outcroppings or sections that jut out. If you are happy with the shape of your rock, don\u2019t worry about shaping it. You can also rub the stone over a slab of concrete to break off any protrusions."

          "headline":"Rub the stone of rough grade sandpaper.",
          "description":"50 grade is the roughest grade of sandpaper, and is great for further shaping your rock. Use the sandpaper on any protrusions or bumps in the rock you want to smooth. If you are happy with the overall shape of the rock, give the rock an even sanding with the 50 grade sandpaper to smooth it evenly."

Purchase a tube of polish and a sheet of leather from a hardware store if you don\u2019t already have them around the house. Then put a couple dabs of polish on the leather and rub the stone against it. This should give the stone a beautiful, lustrous shine. Make sure not to buy colored polish, or it may stain the stone."

You can buy rock tumblers online from specialty sites or Amazon. Keep in mind that pricing of rock tumblers varies dramatically, so buy one in accordance with your needs.

You don\u2019t want to put rocks of different hardness in the tumbler because the harder rocks will wear down and scratch the softer rocks. You also don\u2019t want to put in differently shaped rocks, with some being jagged while others round, because the rounder rocks will get polished faster than the irregular rocks.

Seal the lid of the tumbler and turn it on. Run the tumbler for 24 hours and then open it to check on the progress of the rocks. Then put the lid back on and start the tumbler again. Tumble the rocks for 3 to 7 days, checking every 24 hours to make sure that everything is going smoothly. The coarse grit is meant to smooth out the shape of the rocks. For rounder rocks, it should only take about 3 days to get a nice shape. For more jagged rocks, it may take about 7 to even the surface out. Checking every 24 hours lets you see the progress of the rocks. After checking, you may decide that either they are ready for the next step, or that you want to keep tumbling them for another day."

Don't wash the grit down the sink because it will solidify and clog your drain. Instead, throw it in the garbage. Thoroughly wash your rocks and the tumbler until they are spotless.

Run the tumbler for four or five days, checking every 24 hours. After four or five days, stop the machine and open it up. Place the rocks in a container and clean out the grit. Again, make sure that the rocks and the container are completely clean, and throw out the grit instead of flushing it away."
