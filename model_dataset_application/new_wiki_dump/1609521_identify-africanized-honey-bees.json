AHB are typically about 10% smaller than their counterparts, however, this is subtle and cannot be noticed with the naked eye. The size difference can usually only be noted using professional measuring instruments found in a laboratory. Not even experienced bee keepers can tell the difference simply on sight.

          "headline":"Look for differences in aggression.",
          "description":"European honey bees and AHB respond differently to provocation. While all bees will respond aggressively to perceived dangers to their hive, AHB much more so. Whereas a EHB may send out as few as 10-20 guard bees to respond to a threat within 20 yards (18.3 m) of the hive, AHB may send several hundred with a range of 120 yards (110 m) from the hive. This is also seen in how many stings you can expect to receive if you encounter the hive. An AHB hive can administer as many as a thousand stings if disturbed whereas 10-20 strings is typical for a disturbed EHB hive.

Scott McCombe\t\t\tPest Control Specialist\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: There are a few behavioral traits that can help distinguish Africanized bees. They exhibit extreme defensive behavior in comparison to the relatively docile European honey bee. They also have smaller colonies, and their colony sites tend to be unusually exposed, such as being found in small tree cavities, discarded tires, meter boxes, overhangs, and tree limbs."

          "description":"Africanized honey bees are more solitary foragers than European honey bees and are typically considered opportunistic. AHB also tend to forage at different times than EHB. AHB forage very early in the morning or late in the evening when the sun is disappearing, unlike EHB. They also seem to be less prone to be discouraged by overcast, cold weather and even light rain whereas EHB tend to stick to sunny days and are more sensitive to poor temperatures and rain."

          "headline":"Observe different swarm patterns in AHB.",
          "description":"Swarming is when a queen leaves a hive and tens of thousands of worker bees follow in order to find and form a new hive. EHB tend to do this about once a year. AHB have smaller nests that they more readily abandon and thus will swarm 6-12 times a year. This is why AHB are typically less sought after by beekeepers. This constant swarming can really reduce the population left behind in their hive and require them to introduce new queens regularly. Because of their frequency, AHB swarms tend to be much smaller than those of EHB.

Steve Downs\t\t\tLive Bee Removal Specialist\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: Watch the bees' flying pattern for a clue to their species. If the bees are zig-zagging in and out of the hive, rather than calmly flying in a straight line, they may be an aggressive hybrid or even an Africanized hive. Also, most Africanized bees will approach you in an aggressive manner if you are anywhere within 5-15 feet of their hive."
