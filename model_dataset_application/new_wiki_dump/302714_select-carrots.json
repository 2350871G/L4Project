Unless you want a carrot that tastes old and woody, skip it. Many carrots develop some cracks from absorbing too much water while growing. These are still healthy to eat. Since everyone else may skip them, it can be better to choose them to avoid food waste. A few ridges or cracks are fine. As long as the carrot isn\u2019t excessively or deeply cracked, chances are it\u2019ll be okay for you to pick. Look around for soft spots and other problems to make sure."

After about two weeks you may also notice soft spots or rot. It\u2019s best to use the carrots as soon as possible to avoid this. Carrots may also be blanched and frozen. These will last up to eight months, but the carrots lose some nutrients and flavor."
