Between paying any costs associated with leaving your current residence, hiring movers, paying a security deposit on a new place to live, and getting set up with new utilities there, the move itself will be quite costly as well. To truly be prepared, you should start saving as far as a year in advance of your move. You should compare your current and expected costs of living and determine whether this is a relocation you can afford at this time."

To increase your chances of getting a job this way, try leaving your current address off your applications, or use a local New York address. Look for opportunities in areas that interest you.
