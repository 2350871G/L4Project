Use an Excel spreadsheet to start the process. First, put down how much you\u2019re willing to spend. Afterwards you can begin to break down all the different sections of spending, such as food and decorations."

You might have to combine themes in order to make this work if the two kids are of the opposite gender. In the long run, this will save both money and hassle for everyone, but will require more communication. Make sure to go over the budget and planning with the other parents carefully so that each side can pay for things equally. Or you can split it up by duties; they can organize food and you can make the decorations. Just make sure that things are done fairly so that they\u2019ll want to do another joint party with you the following year."

          "description":"The location will decide what kind of activities your guests will be able to engage in. Where you have it will have a lot to do with the age of your child and that of the guests. If it\u2019s summer, the community pool is a great option for inexpensive fun. Museums are exciting and educational for younger kids who have inquisitive minds. Having it in the home allows for ease of mind in terms of safety because of the controlled environment. It also means more work to prepare everything for the big day.

Do some investigating to find out who your child\u2019s friends are and what the social circles at their school are like. Just because your child doesn\u2019t want someone to come, it doesn\u2019t always mean they shouldn\u2019t be invited to the party. If one of the kids in the class is always being left out then make sure to include them. How would you feel if it was your child being excluded from everything? Kids sometimes don\u2019t realize how their decisions impact others; this is a great time to teach them how to empathize with the people around them."

Include a disclaimer that food will be offered and ask for the parents to send all information concerning their children\u2019s allergies so you can plan accordingly. Also, provide your phone number and an RSVP date. That way you'll know who can and can't come so you can buy enough materials and food for everyone. Mention anything guests will need to bring, such as a swimsuit and towel if the party is at a pool."

Candy and soda won\u2019t cut it, unless you want a riot of hyper munchkins on your hands. If feeding everyone would break the budget, try and plan to have the party between two and five and so that you\u2019ll only be expected to provide snacks. There are some great meals that can be made in bulk, which cuts down on the cost. You could provide spaghetti, chili dogs, or a taco bar. Be sure to ask your child which one they would prefer."

If someone is allergic to peanut butter, choose alternative snacks. But if one or more of the children have an allergy like celiac, it might be easier to cook them their own individual meal. If you do this, make sure the meal is as fun and exciting as what\u2019s being offered to everyone else; you don\u2019t want them to feel excluded because of their allergy. This will mean buying some new cookware and dishware so that there is no possibility of there being contaminants in the food. Clean your house thoroughly and wipe down anything the children might touch or climb on if they\u2019re allergic to materials that you use on a daily basis. If a child has a severe enough allergy, their parents might send them with an EpiPen. Make sure you know how to use one of these just in case of an emergency."

Have some peanut butter or other kinds of fun dip to make these healthy choices a little more exciting to the young\u2019uns. Fruit is also a sweet alternative to candy. Make sure to cut up all produce into small pieces if the party is for children under the age of five."

This also depends on if you\u2019re having a house party, because outside venues will often run their own activities. A good opportunity for keeping a tight budget is to reach out to community contacts like baby sitters, police officers, or fire fighters so that they can put on a little interactive show for the youngsters. Libraries are also good resources for finding affordable fun for the group."

With all the cake, ice cream, and candy that you\u2019re pumping into these kids, you\u2019ll need to help them get their energy out in a productive way. Games like capture the flag or themed versions of tag are good options because their competitive nature makes kids forget they\u2019re blowing off steam."
