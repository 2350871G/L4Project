          "description":"You\u2019ll be using a large knife to kill the lobster, so pick up the lobster by its back and set the lobster on a sturdy cutting board. Also place a baking sheet underneath the cutting board so that any liquids that come out of the lobster don\u2019t cause a mess. Although the lobster\u2019s movements will likely be minimal, it can still potentially hurt you with its claws. Keep rubber bands wrapped around the lobster\u2019s claws while you handle it to ensure your safety."

          "headline":"Place the tip of a large chef\u2019s knife right behind the lobster\u2019s eyes.",
          "description":"Get a large, sharp chef\u2019s knife that\u2019s 8-12 inches (20.3-30.5 cm) long. Locate the crack of the lobster\u2019s head, which should be centered between the eyes and about an inch or two (2.5-5 cm) behind them. Keep the lobster still by holding it firmly with your nondominant hand. Then place the tip of your knife on this spot with the blade facing the front of the head."

This will cut off the lobster\u2019s central nervous system, ensuring that it doesn\u2019t feel pain. Don\u2019t be alarmed if the lobster\u2019s legs, tail, and/or claws continue to move after you\u2019ve killed the lobster. These are simply post mortem muscle twitches, which happen after death as a result of chemicals releasing from the lobster\u2019s nerve endings."
