If you already have white carnations in your garden, cut a few to color. You can buy white carnations at any florist and in most grocery stores, too. When you cut the flowers, leave at least 6 inches (15 cm) of stem. Consider the size of the vase that you are planning to use to display your flowers when cutting your carnations."

Fill up each vase about 1/4 of the way with water. Next, add in food coloring for each color you want to create. You'll need a lot of food coloring to get an effect, at least 15-20 drops. You'll need more if you want them darker."

          "description":"Once you have your vases ready, you'll want to cut your flowers again. Cutting the flowers again allows them to draw up more of the colored water. It's best to cut the flowers under running water or underwater because that keeps the flowers from getting air bubbles in their stems, which block the water."

          "description":"To create carnations that are multi-color, you must split the stem in half with a craft knife or box cutter. Split it down the middle lengthwise, being careful not to cut your fingers. Only adults should do this step. You may also be able to split it three ways, if the stem is especially thick."

Make sure you do not separate the bottom stems from the flower or break the stems higher up. The cups should be right up next to each other, so you don't have to spread the bottom stem apart too much."

          "description":"Now, you must wait, as this process takes time. You'll need to wait at least a day for the color to develop. In fact, color will continue to develop over the next several days if you leave it in the colored water. You may only see parts of the flower petals changing color, not the whole petal. Cut flowers continue to soak up water to create food for the flower. If that water is colored with food coloring, then the color will spread to the petals. If those petals are white, then they'll turn the color of the food coloring."
