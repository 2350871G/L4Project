Otherwise, you can just use brown rice from your grocery store, as the seeds are what you eat. Pick the least processed rice you can find, such as organic brown rice. Don't pick white rice, as it has the shell of the seed removed. It won't germinate."

When you come back and check on them, they should be sprouted. If you're just using brown rice from the grocery store, you may not have high germination, meaning you may only see half your seeds sprout, for instance. If none of the seeds have sprouted, change the water and leave them for another 24 hours. Germinating the seeds this way may help increase the number of seeds that sprout. However, you can skip this process altogether; instead, you can prepare your pot with soil and water and and simply drop the seeds into it to germinate in the soil."

You can use the large buckets you find at home improvement stores, for instance, or any large container, such as a clay pot. Make sure your containers are at least 1 foot (0.30 m) deep and 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61 m) wide. Rice produces 10 pounds (4.5 kg) per 100 square feet (9.3 m). That means if you're only using containers that hold 1 to 2 square feet (0.093 to 0.186 m), you'll only get about 0.1 to 0.2 pounds (0.045 to 0.091 kg) of rice from your plants."

Therefore, it's very important to either pick containers without holes or to plug up any holes the container has on the bottom. Try using clay or rubber to plug up the bottom of the container. Make sure it's water-tight before adding the soil."

Use about 1 part compost to 2 parts soil. Make sure you still have about 6 inches (15 cm) from the top of the pot to add water. If you add soil from your garden, keep in mind it can carry pests and bacteria that you're bringing inside your home. Pre-packaged potting soil tends to be free of these problems. Don't pack the soil in. Keep it fairly loose. Pick a potting soil that's designed to retain water. The bag will say \"good water retention\" or something to that effect."
