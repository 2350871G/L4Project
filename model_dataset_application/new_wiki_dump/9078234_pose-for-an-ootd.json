          "description":"The knee pop is a great way to make your legs look longer and leaner. Start by standing with your legs straight and your toes facing forward. Then, turn one foot so that your toes are pointing out to the side. Then, bend this knee slightly while keeping part of your foot on the ground."

          "headline":"Stand with your feet parallel to your shoulders.",
          "description":"Standing straight and tall is another great option to make yourself look longer and leaner while displaying your OOTD. Simply stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and keep your back and legs straight."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cross your legs.",
          "description":"Standing with one leg crossed over the other one is a great way to bring a nonchalant air to your look. Simply stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and then take one foot and bring it across the other one. You don\u2019t have to full cross your legs for this look. You can simply cross your legs near your ankles or calves. Make sure that you feel stable in your stance. Try holding onto a wall or sturdy railing if you feel a little wobbly."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Lean to one side or against a wall.",
          "description":"Leaning is a subtle way to add some nonchalant flair to your OOTD shot. Try leaning slightly to one side, or lean back against a solid wall. Make sure that you do not lean on anything that might move, such as a bookshelf or a bus."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Walk.",
          "description":"Walking is an easy way to get a great shot. However, make sure to walk very slowly. Walking quickly may result in a blurry shot. Also, make sure to watch for traffic as you walk. If you are wearing a skirt and want to capture how it moves, then you can also try doing a twirl. You can also place one foot slightly in front of the other to simulate movement without actually walking."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Sit on a bench or in a chair.",
          "description":"Sitting on an attractive bench or in a chair is another great way to set the scene. By sitting down for your OOTD shot, you will instantly look nonchalant and relaxed. Try having a friend take a picture of you while you are sitting on a park bench. Or, sit in your favorite chair at home and snap your photo."

          "description":"If you are wearing a skirt for your OOTD, then grasping it with one or both hands is a cute way to accentuate it. Grasp an edge of your skirt with one or both hands as if you are about curtsy, but don\u2019t actually curtsy. Experiment with lifting the skirt to different heights to show off its fullness. If the skirt is not very full, then simply raise it up a little bit. This pose works best with full flowy skirts. It probably wouldn\u2019t be flattering to do this with a pencil skirt."

          "headline":"Raise one arm above your head.",
          "description":"For a relaxed vibe, try raising up one arm over your head. For example, you can lift up your arm by the side of the road in a big city as if you are hailing cab, or raise your arm, bend it at the elbow, and rest your forearm on top of your head. Experiment with different positions to find what look you like best."

        {
          "headline":"Grasp one arm with your opposite hand.",
          "description":"To add some shyness or modesty to your OOTD picture, try grasping one arm with your opposite hand. Use one hand to grasp the other arm around the forearm or wrist. This will create an interesting angle that will not distract from your outfit. You can also try crossing your arms, but doing this might cover up part of your outfit, or make you seem impatient or annoyed. However, if this is what you are going for, then give it a try!"

          "headline":"Keep your arms at your side.",
          "description":"It is also perfectly fine to keep your arms straight out at your sides for your OOTD shot. Just let them fall and hang naturally at your sides. Don\u2019t worry about doing anything with them."
        },

          "headline":"Place one hand in your pocket.",
          "description":"If you are wearing a pair of pants, dress, skirt, or other item of clothing that has pockets, placing one hand in a pocket is a great way to show them off. This pose will also help to create a nonchalant tone for your OOTD picture. Stick your right or left hand into one of your pockets and just let it rest there."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Shrug off your jacket.",
          "description":"If you are wearing a jacket, then shrugging it off partway can be a great way to get a cool, relaxed looking photo. Try shrugging your shoulders and beginning to take off the jacket or coat, and then take the photo so that you get a shot of the jacket halfway on and halfway off."

          "headline":"Fix your hair.",
          "description":"If you want to appear ultra-casual for your picture, try taking a photo while you are in the middle of fixing your hair. You can simply be running your fingers through your hair for the shot. You can also go more extreme by taking a picture when you are in the middle of styling your hair in the morning, or while getting ready for a night on the town."

You won\u2019t have to worry about traffic, pedestrians, or other things that might get in the way of your perfect shot. Try photographing yourself in your living room, bedroom, or another attractive room in your house. Before you take an OOTD shot at home, make sure that there is nothing in the background that might distract from the shot, such as a pile of dirty laundry or another messy area of your house."

This will add interest to your picture and give your OOTD shot some artsy flair. Make sure to avoid buildings and walls that are too bold or distracting. This may take away from your outfit."

          "description":"Props can help to change the tone of the photo. Make sure that this is something that is actually part of your everyday life to keep the shot looking genuine. If you are a mom, try taking a photo with your baby in tow, such as in the stroller or in a carrier. Or, if you always grab a coffee on your way to work, then pose with your coffee in hand. Your cell phone can be a great prop to emphasize that you are a powerful, on-the-go woman or man. Have someone snap a photo of you while you are doing something on your phone. Keep your face neutral or furrow your brow slightly to indicate concentration. Sunglasses are another great prop. Pop on a pair before taking your photo to look extra cool. Hold your jacket over one shoulder. If it is cool enough to take off your jacket or coat, then hold it in one hand and dangle it over your shoulder. This will give you a laid back, nonchalant look."

          "headline":"Check the lighting.",
          "description":"Taking your photo in good lighting is crucial to getting a good shot. That is why taking your picture outside during the day is often the best choice. Check to see if there are any odd shadows before you take your shot. If there are, then change your position until you find good lighting. If you are at home, try opening windows to let in some natural light, or turn on different lamps to see what works best. If you are out, then finding a spot with partial shade might work best on a bright sunny day."

Instead, you can always ask someone to photograph you. However, if no one is around, then use a tripod or a stack of books to raise up your camera to a good height for capturing your look.
