      "description":"Install and open the Microsoft Jigsaw App. The icons may differ in size and location. Most often, the icon will look like a puzzle piece with the term Microsoft Jigsaw below it, and the classic \"XBOX\" logo above it in a blue bar on your Windows 8, 8.1, or 10 computer. Select \"Jigsaw Jam\" from the game's start screen. This should be the centermost tile in the set of three left-sided tiles in the app. Select the collection. Most often, you'll be starting from scratch; after you've beaten one collection, you can move on to another. Select the game pack (game set). You'll most likely be instructed to pick 1-1, but if you are using this article as a refresher, you can select whatever game pack you last finished on. Recognize that not all collections are unlocked after the first 6 game packs in a collection have been played. You will most likely have to play Classic Jigsaw to gain \"points\" so that you can unlock others. Sometimes, you might even have to purchase more themes in Classic Jigsaw to ensure that Jigsaw Jam can display puzzles you haven't played before - but even these will require you to purchase them with more points or money. Wait for the collection to load."

      "description":"You will have three to six games per game pack. The less time it takes you to solve a puzzle, the better the chances you'll pick up kudos points for quick solves. Pieces built via a correct chain without random clicks tend to give better points at the end. However, few people ever solve entire collections without making mistakes. Speed is a factor in each game. The quicker you can place each piece, the better your chances are of solving all the puzzles in the time frame given."

You need to repeat the current pack and get a better score. You can also click \"Back to menu\" to go back to the packs menu, or click the \"Share\" button to share a post about your achievement to Facebook."
