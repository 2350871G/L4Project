When choosing cutlery, here are some key things to bear in mind:\nThe cutlery must be all metal\u2013\u2013plastic, semi-plastic, wooden or other breakable/non-bendable cutlery won't work. Use cutlery in good condition. Avoid using pieces that are flaking or badly stained. They risk detracting from your d\u00e9cor. If the cutlery appears weak, use if for a different craft purpose. The cutlery needs to withstand being bent into its new shape. If you're planning a row of hooks (such as for a coat hanging space), varied patterns can look just as elegant as matching ones. In fact, the designs may prove more interesting mixed up. Weave a story into the cutlery you choose. For example, instead of allowing your grandmother\u2019s old set of cutlery to gather dust in storage, use those pieces (perhaps with your family\u2019s permission) to become your hanger art."

Project one: Teaspoon key hanger Select three teaspoons that you like.  Find a small piece of wood. The wood can be a simple rectangle or you could choose a design, such as an animal, flower or house. Pieces of wood already cut into such shapes can be found in craft stores or you can fashion one yourself with a jigsaw. You might like to paint a design on the wood before adding the spoon hooks or sand and finish the wood attractively. Gently bend the handle end of the first teaspoon near the middle of the handle. Bend into a U shape but not too much\u2013\u2013leave the tail of the handle pointing more outward than back toward the spoon. Repeat with the remaining two spoons.  On the piece of wood, mark three even positions for placing the bent spoons.  Using the drill, make a hole in each teaspoon just at the base of the head, top of the handle. Then drill the screw into the wood, through the handle, aligning carefully with each marked spot on the piece of wood or use liquid nails. Attach hanging/mounting hooks to the back of the wood and use fishing wire/thin gauge wire to make a hanging thread. Hang near the front or back door for ease of finding your keys. Keys are slipped over the hooks in the same way as any key hanger hook. Project two: Kitchen hooks Find some solid, quality spoons or forks. You might even mix them. Bend the spoons or forks into a hook shape. Bend the hand from around the middle to form a slight U-shape hook. Keep the hook slightly facing outward\u2013\u2013don't press too far back toward the cutlery. Whether you bend toward the front of the fork or spoon, or away from it, will depend on your preference for the final look, as well as whether the base of the cutlery has a monogram you'd like to show. If you bend to face the front of the spoon or fork, a monogram at the base of the handle will be hidden, whereas if you bend the hook toward the back of the fork or spoon, the monogram will show up clearly on the outside of the hook. This is much better where you want the monogram to feature. Choose a good place to attach the hooks.

Bend the base of the fork into a small U shape hook, keeping the tail slightly faced outward. Bend toward the front of the fork, not its back. Find a suitable place to attach the fork to the wall above your desk. Alternatively, it might be better attached to a bookshelf or other item near or on the desk, to even on the desk itself. Using the drill, make a hole in the fork just at the base of the head, top of the handle. Drill a hole into the wall. Attach with a screw. (Or use liquid nails if you're not drilling.) Use.
