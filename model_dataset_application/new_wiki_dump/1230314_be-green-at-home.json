          "description":"Nearly half of your home\u2019s energy expenditures come from heating and cooling. To reduce the amount of heating and cooling needed, it is important for your home to be well-insulated. Ideally your home would be well-insulated when it was built, but this is not always the case. To improve your home\u2019s insulation, hang thermal curtains over your windows. Curtains can go a long way in keeping out the cold or heat, depending on the season. When choosing curtains, pick a fun pattern or an elegant design so that they are a piece of decor for your home as well. They will look great and keep your home insulated to cut down on your heating or cooling bill. If there are any gaps or places where you notice air getting in, be sure to seal these. Buy some caulk from a hardware store to seal the edges. If you aren\u2019t comfortable doing this yourself, hire a professional to help."

          "headline":"Upgrade your windows.",
          "description":"Much of a home\u2019s heat or air conditioning escapes through windows. When your old windows need upgrading, install energy-efficient windows. They are typically double-paned for lower levels of air leakage. Look into their energy performance ratings to see which ones will fit your needs and best cut down on your energy consumption. Make sure they are properly installed so that they perform correctly. Energy-efficient windows vary greatly in terms of quality and price. On the low end, you can find them for about $100/window, which will usually have a vinyl frame. These can still be a good option and work well to reduce air leakage. On the higher end, they can cost $1000+ and can have frames of vinyl, wood, aluminum, or wood-clad. To install windows, hire an expert, either an experienced contractor or a window professional. Oftentimes, you can have someone install them from the place where you buy them. Window installation requires a certain level of expertise that often goes beyond a general handyman."

          "description":"When it is time for new appliances, look for ones that are Energy Star certified. These will save you money in the long run by requiring less energy to run them. Most appliances are available Energy Star certified, from refrigerators to dishwashers to washers and dryers. You don\u2019t need to replace all of them at once, but even upgrading one of your appliances can make your home more green."

          "headline":"Replace your light bulbs.",
          "description":"This is a simple and inexpensive way to be green at home. You need lightbulbs so you might as well use the ones that are efficient. Choose compact fluorescent bulbs (CFL), which use about 75% less electricity and last about 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs. They convert energy to light rather than to heat for optimal and efficient lighting."

          "description":"That way, no heating is required. Cold water still does a good job of cleaning your clothes, it keeps colors from running, and it eliminates heating energy. For laundry, be sure to wait until you have a full load so that you aren\u2019t wasting water either."

Some locations don\u2019t get enough sunlight for this to be effective and the upfront costs of installation can be high, although it does save money in the long run because you eliminate other bills. If you aren\u2019t able to install solar panels, you can still benefit from sunlight. To warm up your home, open the curtains where the sun will enter. With the warm sun pouring in, that room will raise several degrees without requiring any energy consumption."

          "description":"You might have learned that room temperature is 72 degrees. While this might be ideal, it isn\u2019t necessary and, depending on your climate, might require a great deal of heating and cooling. In warm summer months, try keeping your home at 78 degrees and in cold winter months, keep your home at 68 degrees during the day and 55 degrees at night. If you bundle up with a down blanket and some fleece, you will sleep soundly and won\u2019t even notice the cooler temperature. If you are too hot in summer months, try misting some cold water on your face, using an energy efficient fan, and wearing thin clothing. Close your thermal curtains to block sunlight from entering. If you are too cold in winter months, try wearing a warm sweater, slippers, and sitting under a cozy fleece blanket. Enjoy a mug of hot tea and sit by a fireplace. You can be warm and comfortable without having to pay excessive heating costs."

Most plastic containers, glass jars, tin cans, and paper can be recycled. It\u2019s just as easy as throwing it in your garbage. Simply place it in your recycling bin instead. This will greatly reduce waste in landfills and will allow your items to be reused instead of wasted."

Simply take items to a Goodwill facility, sell them online, or give to a friend or family member. Try not to throw any of this out unless it is completely useless. If you outgrow a shirt, someone else will gladly wear it, especially someone in need. This is a great way to help other people and take care of the environment. Be especially mindful of electronics. Many people have old cells phones lying around or multiple computers and tablets. It is very important not to simply throw these out.

A lot of energy, resources, and waste result from each item that is made. Try to pick out a few nice items that will last you a long time as opposed to buying something new every few months. This will help you to avoid throwing things out and will greatly help our planet."

Instead of paper towels, use a cloth towel. Instead of paper or plastic dishes, use ceramic ones. This way you aren\u2019t continually buying and throwing things out, but are instead reusing a single item. This greatly helps to cut back on waste and is a simple way to go green."

          "description":"Instead of throwing out old scraps of food, you can compost them. This way they will break down into good useful soil instead of sitting in a landfill for a long time. To make your own, you need to combine brown matter (leaves, dried grass, wood chips, twigs) and green matter (vegetable peels, coffee grounds, tea leaves, apple cores, egg shells). Place them in a covered bin with many holes in it. Mix them together and let them sit. It takes several weeks (or even months if it is cold out) for the items to compost and you can continue adding scraps while you wait. This cuts back on waste and will help with your gardening!"

If you are recycling your goods and composting your organic material, you might be surprised how little waste you create! Feel free to adjust this based on the size of your family, but one bag per month is a good goal to aim for. Even if you just cut back on a bag of trash each month, you will still make a big difference."

Try to shower every other day instead of daily or try to only wash your hair a couple of times per week. You can give yourself a quick sponge bath in the morning instead of a full shower. That way you will be clean and will preserve water. Turn off the water while brushing your teeth. It doesn\u2019t need to run the whole time! Fix any leaky faucets. A few droplets might not seem like much, but this can quickly add up."
