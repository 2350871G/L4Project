Thawing fish in the refrigerator takes several hours. If you're out of time, try a different method. Don't be tempted to just place it on the counter to let it thaw; the outer portions of the fish could start to go bad before the inside is completely defrosted. When using this method to thaw vacuum packaged fish, make sure to remove or open the packaging before leaving the fish in the refrigerator.

The water doesn't have to run rapidly; a steady stream will do. This will defrost the fish more rapidly than placing it in a pot of cold water. However, use running water only for thinner fish filets, since you don't want to waste too much water by running it for half an hour or more. Check the fish to see whether it has completely defrosted by pressing your finger against the flesh. If it still feels frozen in the middle, let it continue to thaw. Don't thaw fish in hot water.
