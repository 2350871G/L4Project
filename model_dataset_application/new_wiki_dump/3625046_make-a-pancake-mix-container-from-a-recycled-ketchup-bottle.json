You don't want any remaining ketchup hiding inside the bottle or else you will end up with ketchup pancakes! Rinse the inside of the bottle with warm water and then add mild dish soap and scrub. Use a thin, long scrubbing brush to get the inside of the bottle. Rinse soap thoroughly and allow the bottle to dry. Ensure that the attached cap is also scrubbed thoroughly. Ketchup tends to get stuck in the hinges and cracks, especially if the bottle has been used over time."
