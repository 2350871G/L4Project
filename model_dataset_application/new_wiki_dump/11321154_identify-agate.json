Mineralogists characterize agate by the stone's multicolored bands, which can either form concentric circles that grow towards the center or, more rarely, horizontal layers. Other types of chalcedony stones (jasper, chert) display banding, so you may have to perform other tests in order to make sure what you have is agate."

Hold the stone you think is agate in one hand, and then hold a similar sized stone that you don't think could be agate in your other hand. If the stone you think is agate feels heavier, you may be correct. This is a relatively inaccurate way of estimating density. If you want to be more exact, you can calculate the density of the stone using a water-displacement method. Agate has a density of 2.6 to 2.64 g/cm3."
