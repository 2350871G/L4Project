          "headline":"Use tatami mats for flooring.",
          "description":"Put tatami mats, which are woven straw mats, over the current flooring in your bedroom. Purchase them online or at a furniture store near you. Before you buy them, measure your room to see how many you need and of what size. Typically, they are about 3 by 6 feet (0.91 by 1.83 m). Tatami mats will complement almost any kind of flooring, but they look especially good with wood floors and earth tones. If you have a bright carpet or another type of floor that does not match tatami mats, consider replacing your floor. Tatami mats are best on smooth floors, like wood or tile. Be sure to put down a mesh liner underneath the mats to keep them from sliding across the floor. If you cannot afford to put tatami mats in your entire room, put them in pertinent places in the room, such as near the bed or in a seating area."

If you so choose, consider adding a bamboo accent wall. You can later accent them with bright splashes of color, such as red, gold, or pink. The goal is to create a soothing ambiance, almost like the feeling one gets from viewing nature."

Japanese-inspired sliding doors typically have wood frames covered with either paper (so that they are opaque) or glass (either frosted or clear). If you cannot accommodate a sliding door, choose a Japanese-inspired swinging door. Alternatively, hang a paper panel over a door opening in an area you don\u2019t need much privacy. Put it on a sliding mechanism so it can be moved in front of the opening when necessary."
