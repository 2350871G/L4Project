When a friend walks into your house, they should be able to see you in the design, and if they can, that is welcoming in itself. It will be familiar to them because they know you. Plus, creating an enjoyable atmosphere is welcoming, too. For instance, if you have a bright personality, that should be reflected in your decorating. Use splashes of bright colors throughout your space. Similarly, if you have a quieter personality, maybe your style will be a bit more subdued, cozier, with jewel tones and throw blankets everywhere."

Blues, greens, and purples, especially in lighter shades, can help create the illusion of more space. Remember, you can add color in all sorts of ways. You can paint a single wall, add curtains, and use colorful pillows, rugs, and throws. You can also paint dull furniture a vibrant color."

You can also paint a mural on the wall yourself. Either way, having art can help bring a room together. Art isn't limited to what goes on the wall. Think about pieces like sculpture or mobiles.

You don't want it too soft, as sinking too far into something can make a guest feel uncomfortable. However, a guest should be able to sit several hours, so the furniture should be comfortable enough for them to do that. Think about comfortable couches that have a bit of firmness to them or dining room chairs that have padding and a comfortable back."

If you're 20 feet (6.1 m) away from each other on couches, that doesn't make for good conversation. Similarly, you don't want to sit on top of each other. You need to find a good balance. Plus, you don't want things like furniture or decorations blocking people off from each other, as that can destroy conversation. Also, try to have furniture facing each other, so guests don't have to swing their bodies around to talk to each other."

Draw back the curtains, or use sheer white curtains so that your home will feel open and airy. Create intimacy with electrical lighting. Overhead lights can be harsh and uninviting, particularly when you have guests over. Instead, use a variety of lamps, track lighting, and/or recessed lighting to create a comfortable atmosphere. Candles or a fire can also make your home feel cozy and inviting, particularly in the winter."
