Add more soap to your bucket if you think you\u2019ll have a tough time cutting through stubborn dirt and grime. Opt for non-abrasive cleaners such as dish and laundry detergents, household all-purpose cleaners, bathroom cleaners, or baking soda.

For best results, soak a cloth with vinegar and cover the stained area with it for about an hour. After removing the cloth, clean the area with warm soapy water and a soft sponge. Stronger acids, such as diluted muriatic acid, should only be applied while wearing rubber gloves and as a last resort."

Soak a clean white cloth with the solution that you\u2019re using and gently rub the stained area until it returns to its natural color. These solutions are fine to use occasionally on stained fiberglass, but should be used sparingly."
