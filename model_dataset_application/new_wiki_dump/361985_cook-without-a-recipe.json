To tell if meat is as cooked as you like, rely on an instant-read meat thermometer. If you're baking cake, muffins, or quick bread, you'll usually want to insert a toothpick to see if it comes out clean.Tip: Keep a chart in your kitchen that shows the food-safe temperature for different kinds of meat and seafood. The more you cook, the better you'll be at gauging how long something takes to cook. For example, if you're stir-frying vegetables, you'll know to add carrots before onions since they take longer to cook."

Your sense of smell can tell you if you've added enough spices, if the food smells appetizing, or if something is burning!"

Instead, practice cooking without a recipe when there's little stress or pressure. You'll enjoy yourself more and might be bolder since there's no fear of making mistakes. It's not a bad idea to have a backup plan, even if you're just cooking dinner for yourself.
