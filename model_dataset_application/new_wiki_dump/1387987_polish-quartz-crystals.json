          "description":"You can do some initial cleaning of your crystals with a toothbrush and water. Make sure you wash the crystals outdoors, as clay and dirt from the crystals can clog a sink. Scrub the crystal to remove set in clay. You will have to do several rounds of cleaning, allowing the crystals to dry in between rounds. Once the crystal is dry, the clay cracks and becomes easier to remove. If clay is particularly stuck on, try spraying the crystals down with a hose with the nozzle set at maximum force. As with using a toothbrush, you will have to do this several times a day, allowing the crystals to dry in between sessions.

Submerge the crystals in enough full-strength vinegar to cover all the crystals. Leave the crystals for 8 to 12 hours. Remove the crystals from the vinegar. Soak them in washing ammonium for an equal amount of time. Then, remove the crystals from the ammonium, rinse them completely, and wipe them dry.

You can trim these materials using a diamond edged saw, which you can purchase at a local hardware store. Diamond edged saws can be expensive, however, so you may want to try borrowing the product from a friend or renting one. Lubricate the crystal with a light layer of mineral oil before you begin. There is no need to saw the crystal or press down on the saw. You simply need to place the crystal under the saw and allow the machine to gradually saw through the crystal. Trim away any unwanted portions of the crystal. There may be areas with stains that would not come out, for example, which you should remove with the saw."

Make sure the material the container is made out of will not corrode in response to acid. Metal containers cannot hold oxalic acid.
