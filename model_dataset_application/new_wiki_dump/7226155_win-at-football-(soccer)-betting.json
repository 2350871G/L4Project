          "description":"\u201cFulltime\u201d betting is the most basic form of betting, and only concerns itself with three possible outcomes: win, lose, or draw. With fulltime betting, all you have to do is decide which team you think has the best chance of coming out on top. Simplifying the betting structure in this way allows you to focus on making safe selections. A common variation of fulltime betting is known as the \u201cAsian handicap,\u201d where a certain number of goals is either added to or deducted from the chosen club\u2019s final score to prevent a draw. Asian handicaps make it possible to actually win money by betting on a losing team. Fulltime betting doesn\u2019t always promise as large a payout as other schemes, but it gives you a better shot at winning smaller sums consistently."

          "description":"To calculate a rough probability from a given set of odds, take the second number of the set and divide it by the sum of both numbers. Then, multiply the resulting decimal by 100 to get the probability as a percentage. If a bookmaker is offering 4/6 odds on Liverpool, for example, it means their chances of winning are 0.6, or approximately 60%, which is reasonably strong. When the odds are presented in decimal form, simply divide 1 by the entire number, then multiply the answer by 100. For 2.26 odds, the process of conversion would look like this: 1/2.26 = 0.44247 x 100 = 44.25%.Tip: It\u2019s important to calculate probability every time you make a bet.
