          "description":"Massage oils may relieve pain at the site for some people. Topical CBD products usually include a carrier such as coconut oil or beeswax to make it easy to apply. Apply a dollop of oil to your fingertips, then massage it into your skin. Make circular motions along your skin as you massage yourself.CBD oil may provide immediate pain relief, but it\u2019s common for the product to take 30 minutes to work. Keep in mind that not everyone notices the effects of CBD oil, so it might not work for you. If you don\u2019t notice effects from the first product you try, switch to a different CBD massage oil to see if it works for you.Tip: Since massage may help relieve your fibromyalgia symptoms, using CBD oil to massage yourself may increase the benefits of both of these alternative treatments."

          "description":"CBD oil tinctures can provide relief in as little as 15-30 minutes if they work for you. Use the eyedropper that came with your CBD oil to measure out 1-2 drops of oil. Then, squeeze the drops under your tongue and hold them in place for 30 seconds before swallowing.Some tinctures come in a spray bottle. If you\u2019re using a spray, apply 1 spritz to the inside of each cheek. Look for a CBD oil tincture at a drugstore, dispensary, or online. Tinctures often come in flavors to make them tastier, so look for a flavor that you enjoy.Variation: If you hate the taste of your tincture, it\u2019s okay to mix 1-2 drops of tincture into a glass of water or your favorite non-alcoholic beverage. Then, drink all of the beverage as quickly as you can. It\u2019ll take at least 30 minutes to feel the effects."
