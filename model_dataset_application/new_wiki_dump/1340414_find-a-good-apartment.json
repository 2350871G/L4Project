          "description":"Determine what you can afford each month by factoring your income and expenditures. Include groceries, transportation, social activities, utilities, and gym membership as your expenditures. Make sure you provide realistic numbers so that you can still save in case of emergency. Do not be tempted to look at apartments above your price range. You will waste time and resources looking at larger and newer spaces that you cannot afford. If your budget is tightly restricted, focus on finding cheap apartments that offer security and cleanliness over prime location or what your wealthier friends can afford."

Make sure to set your priorities and don\u2019t compromise them. Remember that you may be locked into a lease so make your decision wisely."

          "description":"Prices may be much higher during the summer because that\u2019s when a lot of people tend to search for a new apartment. Depending on where you live and whether you have a timeline, it may be best to search during October to December or February through March. People do not want to move during the holidays or cold months so take advantage of the drop in competition. Places tend to stay vacant during these times so you may see some prices drop if you are willing to wait a month or so. If you live in a location with a lot of college students, waiting until after school starts in September can help you find a reduced rental rate."

Schedule your visit as opposed to simply dropping by. Take photos and ask questions during your visit to make sure the apartment meets all your standards. If the person showing the apartment is unable to answer a question, be sure to get his contact information so that you can follow up."

Keep all the information organized in a single document complete with pictures and a pros and cons list. You may also be able to place them on a map and order them according to convenience of travel from your work or school. Spreadsheets are great to keep track of things like rent, amenities, security deposit, lease length, and contact information. Keep any additional notes and how many times you have visited the location. The more informed of a decision you can make, the better."

You may look at locations a little bit further than you originally planned or building without certain amenities. Prioritize what you are able to be flexible with and change your search criteria. Many times it is the location that is the most difficult thing to find as the most prime apartments are often taken or priced for their coveted location. While your commute may factor into your location, also factor in safety and cleanliness. Adding a few minutes to your commute is an easy sacrifice for a safe and clean apartment."
