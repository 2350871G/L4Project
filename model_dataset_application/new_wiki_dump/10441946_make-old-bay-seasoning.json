If you love the taste and nostalgic qualities of warm baking spices, use more nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. To bring out a more floral, grassy flavor, add more celery salt.

You can also use an electric spice grinder to make it easier. Alternately, you can use a coffee grinder. Make sure to clean it out thoroughly first, or use a separate coffee grinder for your spices to avoid making them taste like coffee."

Keep Old Bay in a cool, dark place. The more spices are exposed to heat and light, the quicker they lose their potency. Keep your spice blend in a pantry or cupboard with the door closed.

If this method doesn\u2019t help, and your Old Bay seasoning lacks flavor even after toasting, it may be too old. It is probably time to mix up a new batch. Using Your Spice Mix Steam seafood in Old Bay. Dump your seasoning into a pot of boiling water, and then add shrimp, crabs, or other seafood. The spices will flavor the meat as it cooks.

Serve a combination of Old Bay and vinegar to use as a dip. Add white vinegar to Old Bay gradually until you get a mixture that has a paste consistency. Serve it in a bowl on your table, and dip seafood like crab and shrimp into it. Fry meat or seafood with an Old Bay coating. Mix Old Bay into flour, and dredge your chicken or fish in it. You can then pan fry in a small amount of oil, or fry the whole piece of meat in a deep fryer. Add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) Old Bay seasoning to \u20444 cup (180 mL) potato starch, coat chicken wings in the mixture, and fry them. Mix Old Bay into soups and stews. The warmth of allspice and cloves and the spiciness of pepper and paprika provides great seasoning for a warm, hearty stew in the winter.
