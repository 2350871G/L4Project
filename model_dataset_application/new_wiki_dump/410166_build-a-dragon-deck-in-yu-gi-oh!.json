      "description":"Add generic Xyz monsters you can summon. Many Dragon-Types are level 8 and Rank 8 Xyz monsters are very good, so consider building your deck around them. Ranks 7 and 4 are also good. Several Xyz monsters that support dragons are Queen Dragun Djinn, Hieratic Dragon King of Atum, Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon, and Dragluon. If you have Tuners, throw in some synchros you can make. There are also good dragon fusions, like Five-Headed Dragon. If you want to use fusions, the best fusion spell card available to you is Dragon's Mirror."
