To make this kind of fast-burning torch in an emergency, you'll need:\nGreen stick or branch that\u2019s at least 2 feet (61 cm) long and 2 inches (5 cm) thick\nCotton cloth or birch bark\nFuel, such as kerosene, naphtha-based camp fuel, lighter fluid, or rendered animal or vegetable fat\nMatches or lighter"

          "description":"A torch needs a wick, just like a candle does. You can use strips of cotton to make the wick, such as from an old cotton t-shirt. Cut or tear the fabric into strips that are 1 foot (30 cm) wide and 2 feet (61 cm) long. Alternatively, you can use a strip of birch bark if you don\u2019t have fabric. Find a birch tree and peel a strip that\u2019s about 6 inches (15 cm) wide and 2 feet (61 cm) long. If you're using bark, you'll also need twine, rope, string, or some reeds to tie it in place."

          "description":"Position the widthwise end of the cotton strip at the top of the green branch. Wrap the strip snugly around the top of the torch, wrapping in the same place to form a thick bulge. When you reach the end of the fabric, tuck the end underneath the wrapped fabric to secure it in place. For birch bark, wrap the bark snugly around the end of the torch. When you get to the end of the bark, hold the bark in place and tie a string or reed around the top and bottom of the wick to hold the bark in place."

          "description":"A cotton wick needs to be soaked in a flammable liquid before you can light the torch, because it\u2019s actually the fluid that will burn and not the fabric. Place the wick end of the torch into the fuel and let it soak for a few minutes to ensure the fabric is saturated. With a birch wick, you don\u2019t have to soak the wick because the bark contains natural resins that will burn."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Light the torch.",
          "description":"Use a light, matches, or a campfire. Hold the torch upright and hold the flame to the base of the wick until the wick ignites. This may take about a minute. Once lit, the torch should last at least 20 minutes, and could burn as long as an hour. A birch wick may only burn for about 15 minutes. Don\u2019t burn your torch in dry, heavily wooded areas, as you could set the surrounding wood on fire. Don\u2019t burn the torch inside houses or buildings. Hold the torch at arm\u2019s length to avoid burning yourself. Be mindful of any falling sparks and embers, too, as these could ignite your clothes or other surroundings."
