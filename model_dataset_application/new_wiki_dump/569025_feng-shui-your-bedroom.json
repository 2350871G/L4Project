While you are drifting off to sleep, your body is going into an extra busy energy repair work on many levels. Subconsciously, your head needs good backing, protection and support, just like your back needs it when you are sitting in a chair for extended periods of time. If you don\u2019t have a headboard, fake one by attaching a few panels of wood to the wall behind your bed."

          "description":"There are a variety of mattresses on the market, choose wisely and invest in the one that will promote best sleep and relaxation. The better you sleep at night, the better your health during the day, this is really simple. Be mindful of good Feng Shui and do not buy used mattresses - you never know what energy they have accumulated from previous owners."

          "headline":"Make sure the bed is a good height.",
          "description":"To allow for a balanced Feng Shui energy flow under the bed, you need to have your bed at a reasonable height above the floor level. Generally, the beds that have built-in storage drawers underneath to help you with storage solutions are considered bad Feng Shui beds. Why? Because the energy needs to circulate around your body when you sleep, which is not possible if the space underneath the bed is blocked. For a bed that is low to the ground, get risers to lift it up. This is an inexpensive way to add height to your bed."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Make sure the bed is positioned as far from the door as possible.",
          "description":"Place the bed in the area further from the door or diagonally from the door, but not in line with the door. In other words, you want to be able to see the door while in bed, but not be aligned with the door. Be it the bedroom door, the door to the balcony/patio, the bathroom door or your closet doors, you do not want your bed in line with any of the doors in your bedroom, or too much chi will flow towards the bed. Ideally, the bed can be diagonally positioned from the door, jutting out from the opposite corner. Having your bed positioned too close to the door can lead you to get startled by surprises that may come your way. The further you are from the door, the more prepared you'll be for what may come. This is the same reason why the bedroom should be as far from the door as possible. However, ideally, when you wake up, the door should be in your direct line of vision, or close to it, so you feel that you have control over your life."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Have a good supporting wall behind your bed.",
          "description":"In addition to a good headboard, you always want to have a solid wall behind your bed. When you sleep under the window, your personal energy tends to get weaker in time, as it has neither proper support, nor protection."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Place grounding and balanced energy on both sides of the bed.",
          "description":"Place two nightstands on either side of the bed to create balance while you sleep. Ideally, you can also place the same lamp on both nightstands, to add some soft lighting to your bedroom. This balance is important for keeping you centered, and especially for maintaining equality in a relationship if you share the bedroom with your partner. Ideally, the nightstands should be round instead of square to cut the chi energy that may be directed toward you, which can also be thought of as the \"poison arrows.\" A small nightstand on either side of the bed is another great way to balance the energy in your room."

          "headline":"Keep your bed far away from any TVs, desks, or other distractions.",
          "description":"Ideally, you should move your desk and television out of your bedroom, so the bedroom truly becomes a place where you can rest and relax. However, we all have limited space, so if you do have a television or a desk in your room, position it as far from your bed as possible to not get in the way of the bed's positive energy. If you can, drape a light scarf or blanket over the TV or desk, or even cover it up with a Japanese folding closet to create even more space. Place your TV in a cabinet or place an art cover over it to help it blend into your space."

In general, you should avoid having mirrors in your bedroom, especially if you're sharing it with a romantic partner, because they may open up a space for infidelity. Mirrors are also too energetic for such a restful space. If you like having a mirror in your room, place it on the inside of a closet door and only access it when you need it."

If you have no other options, cover the beam with fabric or hang 2 bamboo flutes from the beam with the mouthpieces pointed downward. This will help block some of the unwanted energy coming from above the bed. The idea is that you don't want to feel threatened in your sleep."

If you are a fan of fountains and water art, place them in a bathroom instead."

If you have to keep it in the bedroom, then try to cover it with a scarf when you're not using it. If you're really serious about it, hide the TV in the closet when you're not using it, or place it on a shelf that can lock up, hiding the TV when it's not in use."

Your bedroom is a place for rest and relaxation, and if you have too many books there, it will be too much like a place for work. Too many books in your resting space can also be overwhelming."
