There are many styles of traps out there, depending on your intention:\nLive traps are the most environmentally friendly and humane, because they don\u2019t kill the rats. Instead, they trap living rats so you can relocate them. Glue traps are extremely inhumane. Animals caught in them often cause themselves severe injuries trying to escape, and they usually die of starvation or dehydration. Snap traps are a less inhumane trap for dealing with rats when you intend to kill the animal. They are spring-loaded and designed to kill the rat quickly. Use a metal or quality plastic one that can be reused. Electrical traps are also less inhumane than glue traps, but are also designed to kill the animal."

You can get them used to the trap by baiting it a few times without setting it, and allowing them to eat the bait. Once you\u2019ve baited the trap a couple times and the rat has eaten the food, set the trap. For some snap traps, you'll just have to pull the lever back to set them, but with others you have to pull back the bar attached to the spring, then wedge the pin into the metal trigger."

You can then dispose of the body according to local by-laws, such as by burying it or throwing it in the garbage. If you happen to find a live rat caught it a glue trap, you can free the animal by massaging cooking oil or mineral oil around the glue where the animal is stuck. Eventually the oil will remove the glue\u2019s stickiness, and the animal can then be freed and transferred to a shoe box for relocation."
