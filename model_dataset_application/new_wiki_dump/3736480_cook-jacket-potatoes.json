The potatoes are ready when the skin is crispy and the interiors are soft when poked with a fork. You may want to place a baking sheet under the potatoes on your oven's lower rack to catch any drippings. If you prefer soft jackets, wrap the potatoes in aluminum foil and poke holes in the foil before placing them on the rack to start baking."

To make your potatoes into a meal, top with chili (either meat or vegetarian) or roasted vegetables. For a delicious twist, try jacket potatoes with smoked salmon, cream cheese and capers."
