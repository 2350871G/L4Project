          "description":"Cotton is an easy to wash, natural fabric that's great for people with allergies. Unlike some synthetic fabrics, cotton isn't highly flammable, so it's great for bedding. Check the label on the fabric you want to use to see if it's cotton. Don't blend different types of fabrics together. This can make your quilt feel uneven, and it'll be harder to clean your quilt.Tip: If you're making a quilt for a baby or child, cotton is the best material to use. If you can't find a 100% cotton fabric, a cotton blend is a good alternative."

          "description":"Quilts are a great way to save and display fabric items that are important to you or someone you care about. Check the labels on the items to make sure the items you incorporate into the quilt are made from the same fabric types. Then, cut the items into squares to make your quilt. For instance, you might create a quilt out of baby clothes, baby blankets, vintage handkerchiefs, or t-shirts from a child's high school clubs."

          "headline":"Avoid using synthetic fabrics if you're a beginner.",
          "description":"Synthetic fabrics, like polyester, nylon, and acrylic, are hard to work with because they come in different textures and weights. Additionally, it can be difficult to sew certain types of synthetic fabrics because they may feel spongy or too thick to penetrate with a needle. In general, synthetic fabrics aren't great for quilting. However, experienced quilters might choose to use them if they want a certain color, texture, or pattern that isn't available in cotton."

          "headline":"Use solid-colored cotton fabric for the back of your quilt.",
          "description":"Every quilt needs a back, and typically it will be a solid color that matches the pattern on the front of your quilt. Opt for a color that unites all of the patterns and colors you used in the quilt design\nIt's best to buy the fabric for the back of your quilt when you buy the fabric you plan to use for the front of the quilt. That way, you can make sure all of the fabric works well together.Variation: You might prefer to use a patterned or gradient color fabric for the back of your quilt. Choose a pattern or color gradient that goes well with the fabric on the front. As another option, use one of the patterns you incorporated into the front pattern for your back fabric."

          "description":"This will help you understand the labels on the fabrics. Plus, you can use these terms to ask for help at your local fabric store. Here are the types of fabrics you'll find for quilts:\n\nSolid fabrics are a single color and don't have a pattern. They're great for the back of your quilt or as accents for a fabric. Mini print fabrics have a tiny print and usually have limited colors. It's easy to work with these prints because they aren't as mismatched. Calico fabrics have a small-scale print that includes a variety of colors. They may be harder to combine with other fabrics, but they can be visually interesting. Dot fabrics have the look of a polka dot print. However, the print doesn't just use dots. It may instead feature flowers, stars, or geometric shapes that are evenly spaced like polka dots. Airy fabrics have very subtle line designs and don't have many colors. Large scale fabrics have big prints or designs that cover the entire surface of the fabric. These designs are best for large quilt squares or for a flashy backside of your quilt. However, it's hard to cut it into small squares. Striped fabrics feature various-sized stripes. You can use stripes to draw the eye in the direction of the lines. Geometric fabrics feature geometric shapes in large stripes. Like regular stripes, geometric designs can draw the eye in the direction of the pattern. Tone-on-tone fabrics have varying gradations of the same color. They are a great way to incorporate a small amount of pattern into your quilt. Directional fabrics have a design that goes in one direction. It's the most difficult fabric to work with because it's easy for this design to get crooked or skewed. Generally, this type of design isn't great for beginners. Low volume fabrics have a white or cream background with a small black print or geographic design. They're easy to use as a neutral in your quilt, as the pattern won't stand out."

          "description":"If you're making a quilt for a particular occasion or to give as a gift, think about what type of fabric would best fit the recipient. For instance, a quilt for a baby shower would likely have a theme and colors that will fit the baby's nursery. Similarly, when making a gift, think about the person's interests, hobbies, and favorite colors. As an example, let's say you're making a quilt for your best friend, who likes mystery stories, reading, and the color yellow. You could pick novelty patterns that feature books and magnifying glasses, along with a few basic patterns like stripes and geometric patterns to add more visual interest. Additionally, you might add solid-color squares to blend the patterned squares together. For another example, let's say you're planning to submit the quilt for a local fair exhibit. You might look for novelty patterns that evoke your area's history or popular attractions, such as apple pie and trees to represent a local orchard. Then, you could incorporate red, tan, or green basic patterns and solid colors to bring the pattern together."

Always choose this fabric first so that you have a controlling theme for your quilt. For instance, when sewing a quilt for a baby, you might choose a rubber ducky fabric to be your main pattern. Then, you'd select other patterns and colors that work well with the ducky fabric. Similarly, if you were making a quilt for a child who's a ballerina, you might choose a ballet slipper print as your main design.Variation: If you're creating an eclectic quilt or just using scraps, it's okay to skip this step.

Select complementary colors, and look for small-scaled, striped, or geometric patterns that don't compete with your main pattern. Depending on the main color or pattern you're using, consider adding more novelty prints to the pattern. As an example, let's say you're looking for other fabrics for your ducky quilt. You might choose a dark and light blue to compliment the yellow of the ducky. Additionally, you could mix in blue stripes or geometric prints. Similarly, for the ballet slipper quilt, you might use different shades of pink to pair with pink slippers.Tip: If picking your color combinations is hard for you, try a color combination generator. For instance, Abobe Kuler allows you to pick the main color of your quilt, then it will show you 6 colors that will go best with it."

However, your blender fabric must match each of the fabrics you're using in your pattern. This is the fabric that will go between the squares.
