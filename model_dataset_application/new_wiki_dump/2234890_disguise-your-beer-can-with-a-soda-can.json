Here is what you will need:\nCan of beer (full)\nCan of soda (empty)\nCan opener\nScissors\nMetal file Remove the entire top of the soda can. Use a can opener to evenly slice off the top of the soda can just under the lip. Be sure to move the can opener slowly around the whole top to prevent tearing to the can or inquiry to yourself. Cut off the base of the soda can. Again, you can use a can opener to take off the bottom portion where the can curves inward. This is where the beer can will fill the indented portion of the base. Clean up the bottom of the can. Use scissors to evenly cut just above the line that separates the silver portion at the bottom. This will ensure that you make a perfectly neat edge all the way around. Cut the can down the middle. Find a part of the can which has a line of writing or other line that you can neatly follow for cutting along the side. Cut along this line using scissors, from the base to the top of the can. This will open the can. Covering Your Beer Can File the edges. After you slice the can in half, there may be uneven metal along the edges you've just cut. Use a metal file to smooth out both edges so they come back together evenly. Roll the can up tightly. This will help restore its ability to spring back together at the cut so that it won't leave a gap when slipped over the beer can. Hold it in place for about thirty seconds, and then let release it.
