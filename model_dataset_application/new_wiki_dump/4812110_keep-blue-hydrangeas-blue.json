          "description":"Hydrangeas are rather unique garden plants because of their ability to change color according to the pH level of your soil. This means the color of hydrangeas in your garden will depend on how acid or alkaline the soil type is. The scientific reason behind this is that different levels of aluminum become available to the plant depending on the soil's acidity level (also known as pH). Acidic soils have a high aluminum content, turning the flowers blue. An alkaline soil will produce pink blooms in hydrangeas; an acid soil will cause the same plant to bear blue flowers. The exception to this is white or green hydrangeas, which are unique varieties and don't change color. You won't have any success trying to change a white hydrangea to pink or blue!"

If the vinegar fizzes and bubbles when it comes in content with the soil, this means that the soil is alkaline and will produce pink hydrangeas. The more intense the fizzing, the more alkaline the soil. If nothing happens when the vinegar comes in contact with the soil, this means that the soil is either neutral or acidic and is more likely to produce blue hydrangeas."

          "description":"In order to keep your hydrangeas blooming in blue, elemental sulfur should be sprinkled over the soil around the shrub to lower the pH to below 5.5. The exact amount of elemental sulfur required will vary, depending on the soil type and how much the pH needs to be adjusted. Loam or silt loam soil will require a \u00be pound of elemental sulfur to lower the soil pH in a 25 square foot area by one unit. In other words, it will take \u00be pound to lower the pH from 6 to 5. Sandy or sandy loam soil, on the other hand, will require less than \u00bc pound of elemental sulfur to lower the pH by one. Start sprinkling the elemental sulfur about 2 feet (0.6 m) beyond the shrub drip line or outer edge of the shrub. Spread it evenly over the soil up to about 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) away from the stems. This is the area where most of the roots grow and absorb water and nutrients. Use a small hand rake to mix the elemental sulfur into the top 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of soil, then water the area generously to help wash the sulfur into the soil. The elemental sulfur will probably need to be re-applied from time to time in order to keep the blue hydrangea blue."

It's often labeled as \u2018blue hydrangea powder'. Be careful not to apply the powder directly to the root of a plant, as it will scorch the tissue.
