Measure out only half the amount of laundry detergent that you would normally would use, to reduce any damage to the cotton fibres caused by the chemicals. Place it in the washing machine. Ensure that the laundry detergent you use doesn't contain bleach. Bleach can damage the natural cotton fibres, and will cause the sheets to wear out faster. This type of laundry detergent will not only work well for white Egyptian cotton sheets, but also for coloured or patterned Egyptian cotton, as the colours will stay vibrant and bright. Don't use fabric softeners when washing Egyptian cotton, as the harsh chemicals could harm the natural fibres. The sheets will naturally get softer with each wash."
