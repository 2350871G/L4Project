          "description":"Spinach can be incorporated into smoothies in a number of ways. You could hide a handful among fruits and chocolate powder for a smaller daily dose, or put it front and center in a nutritious green smoothie. For instance, you might put one cup (236 millilitres) of milk, one packed cup (30 grams) of spinach, one packed cup (30 grams) of kale, three ice cubes, three strawberries, one banana, and a spoonful of yogurt into your blender, then blend on high for thirty seconds. Drink your spinach smoothies immediately. The iron in spinach is easier to absorb when consumed along with the vitamin C you\u2019ll get in fruit."

While the onions are cooking, mix two eggs together until they achieve a relatively consistent appearance. Add a handful of spinach to the pan when the onions are translucent. Let the spinach and onions cook another minute. Pour the eggs into the pan. After three or four minutes, sprinkle the eggs with feta, salt, and pepper, to taste.

Set the griddle or pan to medium heat. Drain one cup (250 grams) of ricotta or cottage cheese and whisk with a spatula until it is smooth. Add, two egg yolks, one finely-chopped green chili, 1/3 cup (120 grams) rice flour, \u00be teaspoon of chili flakes, and salt, to taste.

For instance, cook eight ounces (227 grams) of whole-wheat macaroni noodles. When it\u2019s done, strain but reserve \u00be cup of water. In another pot, melt two tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add two medium-sized, finely-chopped shallots and cook for about three minutes or until soft. Stir occasionally.

Add 2/3 cup (158 milliliters) shredded mozzarella, 1/3 cup sour cream, 2/3 cup shredded Swiss cheese, and one tablespoon grated parmesan. After the cheese has melted, add six packed cups of spinach and stir for one minute. Add the pasta, \u00bc teaspoon pepper, one teaspoon salt, and nine ounces (255 grams) of roughly chopped artichoke hearts. Stir everything together and pour everything into a two-quart (1.89 liter) baking dish. Top with 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) shredded mozzarella and three tablespoons grated parmesan.
