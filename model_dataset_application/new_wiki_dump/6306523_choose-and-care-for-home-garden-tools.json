      "description":"Ensure you will be comfortable working with it, since you will have to do a lot of lifts and digs and pulls. Look for items that are lightweight with wide handles as it will give you proper grip to hold. After you have received your product, trying the product is indeed very important especially if you have a small hand, weak grip or difficulty moving your hand."

      "description":"While buying garden products, check the length of the item to ensure it allows you to work without bending too much or pressuring your back. Working with a good posture in the garden will help avoid stresses, aches and strains. Therefore, consider choosing a product that will give you comfort, while also help you accomplish task effectively."

      "headline":"Factor durability into your decision.",
      "description":"Finding a quality product between the jumbles of various brands and types of items at the garden store can be a bit tricky. However, you could sort out the trouble by deciding whether you are looking for durability or are fine with replacing the product. Read online reviews that will give you a gist about the product. If you find the reviews to be positive, then there's a green signal for you. Also, find out how long the manufacturer's guarantee will last. If you want the product to last longer, check the material it is made of. This will let you know whether it is worth purchase or not. For instance, if you are looking for lightweight tool, a fibre, aluminum or plastic tool can be ideal for you. Stainless steel tools slide easily through the soil and is also easy to clean. If you are searching for the strong, robust, durable equipment, then a traditional forged steel tool is the thing for you."

      "headline":"Consider getting power tools for big jobs.",
      "description":"For gardening, you cannot always rely on manual garden equipment. For task like grass trimming, you can use power tools, which is an easier way to complete the job. These products are either battery-operated or need mains power to run them. Buying them depends on your requirement and whether you are comfortable using it or not. Power tools are certainly heavy, so decide if you can cope with the weight. Nevertheless, it is an easiest option for trimming hedges and grass. Also, always consider using residual circuit breaker when you are working with mains powered products."

    {
      "headline":"Look at tools with interchangeable heads.",
      "description":"They can be the best option as all you will have to do is buy a handle with a suitable handle for you and then get separate tool head like fork, brush, trowel etc. To switch the tools, you will simply have to adjust the tool head over the handle and get started with it. These tools are expensive, but it gives you an added benefit of using the heads with long and short handles, depending on your work."
