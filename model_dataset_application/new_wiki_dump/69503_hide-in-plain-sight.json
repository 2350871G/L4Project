          "description":"Everyone has at least one physical apart that sets them apart from the rest of the crowd. A particularly distinctive facial feature, tattoo, birthmark or scar will all attract attention for the fact that they make you unique. Recognize these traits in yourself, and find ways of covering them up from view. For instance, if you have a striking set of eyes, donning sunglasses will remove this feature from view. If you have tattoos on your arms, wearing a long sleeved shirt will cover them up. If you have a distinctive facial structure, you can even out your features by growing facial hair."

          "description":"If you want to be inconspicuous, it practically goes without saying that you're not going to want to dress particularly fancy, unless you're trying to hide at a formal event. For most casual situations, it's a good idea to dress as you think a completely average person would. Avoid clothing that has distinctive logos or graphic designs on it. Your dress should ultimately be dictated by the setting. If you are at a formal event, for example, dressing yourself down will only bring negative attention your way. It helps to know what other people will interpret as being \"normal\". Although bargain bin clothing is often a good choice for hiding in plain sight, there's sometimes the risk of those old clothes becoming fashionable again."

While the use of camouflage is only helpful when you're trying to hide from a distance, it's the best-known way of truly hiding in plain sight. Wearing camouflage gear in a public setting will attract a lot of unwanted attention to you. Special camouflage clothes are only recommended in instances where you have a chance at being completely hidden, and not just inconspicuous."

If you want to avoid attention, it's a good idea to avoid these little add-ons completely. If you're in close proximity with people, wearing a watch or necklace will make you more interesting to look at. If you must wear a watch, choose a discrete, non-metal watch. Avoid anything large, chunky, blingy, or shiny. The reason you want to avoid accessories, especially shiny ones, is because the sparkle will catch the eye and thus earn you attention. The one exception to wearing accessories is when you are in an environment where everyone wears an accessory for religious purposes, such as a hijab."

If you want to hide in plain sight, keep your hairstyle plain and vague. Avoid anything aesthetic like hair gels or dye. Just make sure your hair is relatively clean. If you usually gel your hair, go without it when you don't want to attract notice. If your hair is completely natural, there won't be as much that stands out. If you have distinctive hair and don't want to lose it for the sake of hiding, wearing a hood or hat will cover it up for you. An uncommon hair color(usually light-colored) or texture(i.e. big hair) relative to the crowd can be a dead giveaway, so if you have either, cover it up under a hat or something"
