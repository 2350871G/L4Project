          "description":"Use any combination of parsley, chives, rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano, cilantro or any herb you particularly love. You\u2019ll need about 1 tablespoon (about 2.5 grams) of the leafy herbs, like parsley, basil, and chives, and about 1 teaspoon (about 1 gram) of the finer herbs, like rosemary and thyme, per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of asparagus. Mix whatever herbs you\u2019re using with about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of cooking oil, and brush the mixture over the asparagus before you cook it. Pair the herbs with the rest of your dish to make a comprehensive meal. For example, if you\u2019re making pizza, use basil and oregano on your asparagus for a nice accompaniment. You can also use dried herbs! The flavor just won\u2019t be quite as strong as it would be with fresh ones. Generally, use 1/3 of the called for amount when switching to dried herbs."
