You may need to water the soil to help loosen it. Depending on the size of the area, tilling may take a few hours. If you are planting somewhere that\u2019s never been planted, tilling is even more important. If you\u2019ve planted before, you don\u2019t need to till quite as thoroughly. Boysenberries grow well in sandy, loamy, or clay-rich soil. They need moist soil, but they are also resistant to drought."

If you don't have a fence around your yard, plant them near to a wall of your house or shed so the plants can cling to it. A fence allows you to tie the plants up, but a wall doesn't give you that option. The main goal is to plant the boysenberries near something they can cling to and be tied to. Otherwise, they will slump over and produce less fruit. Set up a ladder, an old kitchen chair, or stick a broom handle into the ground. Tie the plants to these to support them as they grow."

Otherwise, set your plants up in more than one space in your yard so they have room to grow. Another option, if you have limited space, is to grow the plants in containers. However, keep in mind that container-grown plants will need heavy pruning in order to keep the plant from getting oversized."
