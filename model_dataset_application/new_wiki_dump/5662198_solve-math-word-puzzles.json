Tommy's information would not be included because his marshmallows are not required to complete the problem. The final question, which was identified in step one, does not include Tommy. Sally's information is still necessary, however, because her name is in Henry's equation. Do you see where this is going? Sally = 15\nHenry = (1/3) X (Sally)."

If done correctly, you should be able to replace any unknown variables in your final equation with other information on your list. Eventually, your list should be simplified to the point where all you have left to do is solve a simple math problem. The example above would require one to replace the (Sally) in Henry's equation with Sally's equivalent: 15. You then wind up with this:\nHenry= (1/3) X 15."
