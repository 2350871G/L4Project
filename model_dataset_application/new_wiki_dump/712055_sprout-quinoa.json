  "text":" Preparing Your Quinoa Gather your supplies. For this project you\u2019ll need a fine mesh strainer, 2/3 cup of quinoa seeds, a bowl, water, a tray or plate, cloth, and a sealed glass container or plastic bag. Rinse the quinoa seeds in a bowl. You need to wash the quinoa seeds to remove the soapy outer coating, which is known as saponin. Quinoa should always be rinsed prior to sprouting and cooking. Use a fine mesh strainer to gather your quinoa. Quinoa is small, so you need to make sure you don\u2019t lose any grains. After rinsing the saponin from the quinoa, use a fine-mesh strainer to collect the rinsed quinoa while draining the water into the sink. Transfer the quinoa to a seed sprouter or into a second bowl. Soaking and Draining Your Quinoa Pour cool water into the bowl or seed sprouter. You need to soak quinoa for an extended period of time before you do anything else. Make sure you add enough water so that the quinoa seeds are fully submerged. The temperature should be no warmer than 70 degrees F (21 degrees C). Soak the quinoa seeds. Allow the quinoa to soak for up to 30 minutes. There\u2019s no harm in leaving them in there a little bit longer, but try not to forget them and leave them in the dish the whole night. This may weaken and dissolve some of the quinoa grains. Drain the water after 30 minutes of soaking. Carefully drain the excess water from the sprouter or bowl over the sink. The quinoa should remain in the bowl or the sprouter. One good way to do this is by playing the edge of a spatula in front of the quinoa seeds. The water will still pour around the edges but the quinoa will remain in place inside the bowl. If necessary, use a strainer. However, it\u2019s simpler just to keep the quinoa in the bowl. It\u2019s okay if a little extra water is left behind as long as it isn\u2019t too much. Starting the Sprouting Process Move the quinoa to a dark place. Transfer the quinoa from the bowl or sprouter to a large tray or plate. Move the quinoa away from direct sunlight to a darker area at room temperature. Cover the quinoa with cheese cloth to keep away dust or bugs. Continue the rinse cycle. Once the quinoa is in a dark area you still have to continue to rinse it. Place the quinoa into a sprouter or a bowl again to repeat the rinse and drain cycle. As mentioned previously, continue to rinse and drain the quinoa every 8 to 12 hours over a period of 2 days.

The quinoa should eventually sprout into a plate full of spiral-shaped roots that are at least one-quarter inch in length. Let the quinoa sprouts dry out for up to 12 hours, since excess moisture damages the quinoa crop. Storing the Quinoa Sprouts Place the sprouts in an airtight container. Once the quinoa sprouts are dry, put them in a plastic storage bag, jar, or food storage container that is airtight.
