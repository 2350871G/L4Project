Pinch the edges of the pizza dough to make a proper, thick crust. Using a pastry brush, spread olive oil on your dough, as well as the crust too. The olive oil will make your pizza get this nice, greasier taste. The olive oil also helps the dough get more flavor."

The Parmesan cheese is a key ingredient for topping your pizza, it has this nice salty taste which adds flavor to the pizza. Remember to spread the cheese all around the pizza, not just in one spot. If you do it in just one spot the rest of the pizza slices won't have enough cheese. Sprinkle cheese all around like you are coloring in a circle."

Pizza stones can withstand high temperatures so you won't have to worry a lot about it like other baking pans. Plus you can easily slice your pizza without scratching the bottom or surface. That's why most restaurants and professional chefs bake their pizzas on pizza stones or baking stones. They may be pricy but they last for a long time and are worth it. Follow your pizza or baking stone's package instructions. Some on them give tips and directions on how to bake with your stone. For example, you may need to spread butter on your pizza stone before cooking."
