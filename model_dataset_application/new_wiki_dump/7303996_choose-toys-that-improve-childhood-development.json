          "description":"Gross motor skills are skills like agility, balance, and posture. Your child needs to use large muscle groups to improve her gross motor skills, often when she is standing, walking, running, or shift her weight while standing. Having good gross motor skills will ensure your child has proper coordination of her arms and legs and a good sense of balance. Gross motor skills are a major element of strong physical development in a child, often through repetitive motions and motions that require agility and balance. Your child can work her gross motor skills through running and walking but toys can also allow her to work them in smaller, more manageable ways."

          "headline":"Look for balls in different shapes and sizes.",
          "description":"Foam balls, hollow balls, and bouncy balls are all great for gross motor skill development, especially if your child tends to be more active. Always make sure the balls are not small enough to be swallowed by your child, especially if your child is an infant. Toddlers and preschoolers often possess the motor skills to throw and bounce balls with their playmates. Infants benefit from sensory balls with different patterns and textures. These balls will keep your infant\u2019s attention for longer and encourage them to move. Another option is to get your child small tactile toys like patterned balls or tactile discs. Tactile discs come in a set of five or ten discs with different textures that your child can touch, pick up, and move on her own."

          "headline":"Get your child a tunnel or boxes to form a tunnel.",
          "description":"You can find nylon tunnels made for children at your local toy store or online. You can also purchase foam or nylon boxes that your child can move to form a tunnel. Tunnels and tents are great for building coordination and balance, especially if you are looking for an indoor space to promote positive development in your child. Encourage your child to crawl through the tunnel or tent. Help her move the boxes to make tunnels or an obstacle course where she has to crawl, stand, and use her weight to move the boxes. Place their favorite toy at the other end of the tunnel as bait."

          "headline":"Consider a push bike or a wooden horse.",
          "description":"A small plastic tricycle made for small children or a wooden rocking horse are both great for developing gross motor skills. Look for a push tricycle with no pedals, as this will force your child to use her legs to push herself back and forth on the tricycle. These types of toys help your child to build her coordination skills and her weight distribution skills. Practice riding a bike or a wooden horse can also prepare your child for balancing on a real bike, or a real horse. Make sure the bike or horse is sturdy before you allow your child to play on it. These toys are best for children two years and older, or children who have started to walk on their own."

          "headline":"Get your child a large plastic truck or push toy.",
          "description":"A push toy is good for infants (birth-18 months) and toddlers (18 months-35 months), as they encourage the development of coordination skills and weight distribution skills. You could get your child a large plastic truck that she can push or another push toy like a plastic lawnmower or a small plastic baby stroller. Look for a push toy that is not too big or too small for your child. Your child should be able to move the push toy when she is standing and when she is sitting, as you do not want to force her to use her legs all the time."

          "headline":"Buy an indoor trampoline or a plastic slide.",
          "description":"If you are looking for a larger toy that is more of an investment, you may consider an indoor trampoline or a large plastic slide. These toys are good for toddlers and preschoolers who are walking and are starting to get comfortable with their weight and coordination skills. Supervise your child carefully when they\u2019re using the slide or trampoline. Look for a trampoline that has a safety net around it so your child does not injure herself on the trampoline. You can then let your child play with other gross motor skill toys like bouncy balls on the trampoline. The plastic slide should also have high sides so your child cannot fall out of the slide easily. Place soft mats around the slide so your child has a soft landing if she does slip on the slide. Try not to let her use the slide unsupervised and play with her on the slide, holding her if necessary."

          "description":"Your child develops her fine motor skills through repetitive movements, as this builds her muscle memory. Fine motor skills are skills that are performed with smaller muscle groups, such as her fingers, wrists, and hands. These types of toys will also help your child improve her eye-hand coordination and be more precise with her body movements. You should encourage the development of fine motor skills in your child at an early age, from infanthood into preschool. Reinforcing fine motor skills will allow your child to get used to small movements and give her strong agility skills."

          "description":"Play with small edible object is a great and easy way to improve fine motor skills in infants, especially as they are prone to put almost anything in their mouths. Give your child Cheerios and other small, chewable foods that she can play with in her high chair or when sitting on a clean floor. Encourage her to move the Cheerios around and pick them up and put them in her mouth. You can put the food in a bowl and have her pick them out of the bowl or on a cookie sheet with raised edges so she can play with them without making a big mess."

          "headline":"Allow your child to rip up scrap paper.",
          "description":"Scrap printer paper can act as a useful fine motor skills toy as it allows your child to use her hands and arms. Avoid newspaper, as the newsprint can be dirty and get everywhere. Have your child rip up the paper into pieces and then count the pieces together to practice numbers with her. Make sure the paper is acid free and safe for use for children. You can also use felt pieces, cut into small bits if you are worried about your child putting paper in her mouth."

Playing a keyboard, even badly, can help your child improve her eye-hand coordination and her control over her finger movements. Try to teach her how to hit the keys properly and to use her fingers properly on the keyboard. You can also teach your preschooler basic chords or basic songs like \u201cTwinkle Twinkle Little Star\u201d on the keyboard to improve her listening and playing skills. Another option is to get your child a set of toy drums so she can hit them with her hands and improve her eye-hand coordination. A xylophone is another popular toy musical instrument for children that is good for developing fine motor skills."

Your child can learn to open the box on her own and take out the smaller toys to play with them. This will allow her to work on her fine motor skills and understand how to open and close boxes. She can then also be taught to put the items back into the box during clean up time. You can add larger or more complex toys to the cloth toy box as your child grows older. You may decide to include puzzle pieces or toys that require critical thinking to challenge your child in her older years."

Cognitive development is your child\u2019s ability to process information, emotions, reason, and memory.
