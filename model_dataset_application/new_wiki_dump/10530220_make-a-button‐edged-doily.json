  "text":" Selecting the Fabric and Buttons Aim to match the fabric to the buttons. This may be by color, pattern or even texture, depending on your preference. Some ideas include:\nRed fabric with a mixture of red and green buttons for a holiday theme. Gold fabric with gold buttons for a sumptuous theme. Patterned fabric with buttons that pick up the colors of the fabric; this could even be a rainbow, etc. Choose fabric that is of good quality and durability. Since you may be placing items on top of the fabric, it needs to be able to withstand weight and use. Cotton, linen, hemp, velvet, etc. would work well.

However, metallic thread can be tricky to work with if you\u2019ve never used it before, so try to practice stitching with it on scrap fabric first, to get the feel for it. Preparing the Fabric Decide on the size of the doily. For the purposes of this tutorial, the size suggested is 12 centimetres (4.7 in) diameter. You are free to resize this; just remember that the larger the doily, the more thread and buttons needed to complete the project. Once you\u2019ve mastered the technique, you could consider making a set of doilies of varying sizes. Cut two pieces from the fabric measuring 12 centimetres (4.7 in) in diameter. Use sharp sewing scissors to make a clean cut. If there are any frayed pieces, trim the fabric before commencing. Making the Doily Place the two pieces of cut fabric with the right sides facing together. Sew around the edge of the circle, leaving a small gap that will allow you to turn the doily the right way around. Once stitched, trim away any excess fabric with care (avoid cutting the stitches), then turn the doily to the right side. Stitch around the edge of the doily. Use an up and down buttonhole stitch. This is achieved by sewing the buttonhole stitch, taking the thread down through the fabric. Once you've done this, push the needle under the fabric\u2019s edge, then bring the needle back up in an upward stitch. With the thread sitting under the needle\u2019s point, push the needle up, then down, to form the stitch. Continue in this manner all the way around the fabric. Work the same stitch over the gap left from the previous step as well. Finish with a neat knot. Cut away the thread line and prepare to add the buttons. Rethread the needle with the same thread used to edge the doily. This thread will be used to attach the buttons at the point of each buttonhole stitch made. There is a lot of work involved here, so you may wish to do this in several stages. Adding the Buttons Add the buttons. Find the loop that was formed at the end of a buttonhole stitch you wish to begin from. Weave the needle into the loop to form the catch, then attach a button with a generous length of thread (the button should be a little way out from the doily, not snug) by inserting the needle through one buttonhole. Before bringing the thread back to the next buttonhole stitch, wrap the thread around the shank to strengthen the link (it also looks nicer). The thread is not cut between each button attachment; there will be a visible attachment line all the way around. Repeat for each button to be added, all the way around the doily. It is likely that you will need to renew the thread now and then; be sure to knot off tightly and neatly each time you change thread. Finish up. Knot off the last piece of thread and tidy up the thread as needed. Check that all the buttons are aligning neatly and that the doily sits well when placed down. The button-edged doily is now completed.",
