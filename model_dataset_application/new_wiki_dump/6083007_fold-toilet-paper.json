Gently sit the toilet paper back down.  Pleat Fold Pull out two or three sheets of toilet paper towards you.  Pleat the sheets with an accordion fold. Leave have an inch (one centimeter) gap between each fold. Continue folding in the up and down accordion fashion. Make sure you have at least eight folds, but the more the better. Compress the pleats as tightly as possible.  Fold the stack of pleats in half towards you.  Squeeze the stack together while you press the creases firmly.  Release the stack of pleats. Let the folds to relax. Find the two pleats that are closest to one another. Grasp the two layers closest to one another and fold the corner to form a small triangle. Fold this corner once more to lock the two halves together. Lay the toilet paper back on the roll and fluff. It should look like a fan. Pleated Tuck Tear off a sheet of paper.  Fold the sheet of paper into an accordion up and down fashion.  Compress the pleats into one neat stack.  Fold the pleat stack in half.  Let the pleats relax together. Find the two pleats that are closest to one another. Align the two edges together.  Fold the two edges together to form a small triangle. Fold another triangle to lock the two pieces together. Insert the fan-like sheet of toilet paper into a suitable toilet paper fold, such as the diamond or basket fold.  Basket Fold Pull down one and a half sheets of toilet paper.  Mountain fold the bottom edge of the toilet paper back. Fold back about nearly an inch (two centimetres). Fold back the bottom edge of toilet paper again. The second fold hides the raw edge so the basket will have a soft rim. Valley fold the toilet paper up. Fold as much as you want up depending if you want a shallow or deep basket. Mountain fold the left and right edges of the toilet paper behind. This forms the sides of the basket. The angle of the fold can be sharp if you want a narrow base or subtle if you want a narrow base. Adjust the toilet paper basket up and down to position the basket. If you are going to add a decoration into the basket you can lower the basket. Gem Fold Valley fold the left and right corners of the toilet paper a third of the way in from the edges.  Pull the toilet paper down so the edge is just below the roll.  Valley fold the toilet paper up. Make the fold about an inch (centimeter) above the triangles. Mountain fold the bottom corners under the toilet paper. This makes the bottom of the gem. If this is too tricky you can lift the toilet paper up. Layer the toilet paper back down and admire your gem.  Heart Fold Make a small vertical rip from the bottom edge of the toilet paper. Make it nearly an inch (two centimeters). Fold up both corners of the ripped section of the toilet paper. This makes two small triangles. Try to make these the same size and make sure the folds are at a 45 degree angle. Fold in the left and right corners of toilet paper. Make these triangles the same size as the ones in the middle. Pull down the toilet paper one and a half sheets down.  Valley fold the toilet paper back up. Fold up about three inches (eight centimeters). Mountain fold the bottom corners behind the toilet paper. This makes the bottom of the heart. Ensure you keep the other folds neat. Roll the toilet paper so the heart is in the middle.  Boat Fold Lift up one and a half sheets of toilet paper.  Fold the two top corners down to the middle. The edges meet in the center. Adjust the toilet paper back onto the roll.  Fold in the left and right edges a little. If you want a narrow sail, fold in a lot, and if you want a wide sail fold in a small amount. Valley fold the triangle up at the base. This creates a triangle. Roll the toilet paper down until it is centered.  Fold up the bottom edge of the triangle. This create the hull. For a shallow hull fold a tiny bit, or for a deeper hull fold up more.
