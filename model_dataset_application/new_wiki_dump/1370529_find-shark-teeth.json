For example, sandbar sharks are found in large numbers off the east coast of Florida in spring when they mate. They move north at the end of summer and have their pups, so areas like Delaware Bay have a large population towards the early fall."

          "description":"Look up shark populated areas and select a beach to search for teeth. Sharks live in salt water only (except bull sharks who swim up into freshwater rivers that connect to the ocean). So don't go looking in your local pond. Sharks are more common in hot, humid places such as Hawaii and Florida. Although they can also be found at the poles. Many coastal regions of states near the ocean like California, Florida, Hawaii, Virginia, Carolina, and Alabama were once underwater. You can sometimes even find shark teeth fossils in these areas on dry land or in river beds since large portions of the state were submerged. Sharks were often drawn to these shallow waters to seek food."

Modern shark teeth are usually white in color on the tooth and the root, they are seldom found along the shoreline. Remember everything you find that is triangular isn't a shark tooth, they could be rocks or stones so be sure that you know the looks of a tooth. Look for any souvenir shops near the beach.

You will probably want something to sift sand with, like a colander or strainer. Dig in a place where sand is unusually elevated. Teeth won't always be on the surface.
