Instead, ask your parents if you can move around some furniture to set up your main classroom. Use folding chairs, if you have them, and set them up in rows. For desks, you can use little stools. You can also just use chairs. Pick the front of the classroom and put a big piece of paper on the wall, like the a chalk board. Use markers to write on the paper instead of chalk."

We're waiting!\" Turn the questions into a game. Ask all your students, \"What's 132 minus 17?\" and let them figure it out fast. Whoever gets the answer right quickest gets a candy.
