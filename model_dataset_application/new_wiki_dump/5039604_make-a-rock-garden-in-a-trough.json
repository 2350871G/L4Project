Hypertufa is a mix of cement (eg Portland cement) with peat and perlite; these materials lighten the mix and add texture. Usual proportions are 1:1:1. This material usually needs a little time to cure before it can be planted. Hypertufa provides an aged stone effect but is usually a little lighter to move than a solid stone or concrete trough of the same size. Because of its texture, the hypertufa planter will acquire mosses and lichens on its surface over time. You can poke drainage holes in the trough base before it is dry. You can also use polystyrene fish boxes that are painted grey or covered with grout. This trough will be considerably more fragile than hypertufa."

Add free-draining compost; a good one to choose is compost mixed with horticultural grit."
