      "description":"The sniper is by far the most dominant weapon in the game (at least, the original Halo). It can be used as a short or long range weapon, and can kill in mere seconds. It just takes a little practice and some aiming at the head. For those who play Halo PC on other servers and feel as if you are aiming right at the person but are not killing them, then here is your problem and solution. It is because your internet connection is slightly delayed. Therefore the host of the server has an advantage. In order to hit people effectively, you need to aim slightly ahead of the direction in which the enemy is walking. Based on the speed and direction that the person is walking is how far ahead of them you should aim. In order to kill hosts, you need to aim slightly farther ahead of them you would non-hosts. It takes a little while to figure out how far ahead to aim, but once you do,  you will find that you play considerably better."

      "description":"Many players rely heavily on the rocket launcher and the shotgun when these weapons are crude at best. If you can keep a player at long range, their super weapons lose their effectiveness.In addition, stop using rocket launchers and Scorpion tanks (also, avoid using the banshee, fuel rod gun, rocket hog, and flamethrower in the PC version). These only make you more dependent on weapons which simply require less accuracy. If you force yourself to be precise, you'll develop better skills. The rocket launcher has its place, but it can't be your bread and butter. It should be used mainly against vehicles, also, develop a sense of timing with the rocket, its round will move at a constant, predictable rate so you can time it so that it will intercept vehicles. Also, while using the Sniper Rifle, also try to develop a good \"No-Scope\". No-Scopes are where you are able at aim the sniper rifle at an enemy's head and kill them within short-medium range."
