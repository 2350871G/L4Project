You may need to cut out other parts of your diet if you're worried about fat and caloric intake, but milk should be a priority because of its many health benefits. Calcium keeps bones and teeth healthy. Protein is a good source of energy and builds and repairs your muscle tissue. Potassium helps regulate blood pressure and is important for bone and muscle strength. Phosphorus helps strengthen your bones and teeth. It also helps your body filter waste in the kidneys. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium and phosphorous. Vitamin B12 helps maintain healthy red blood cells and helps maintain nerve tissue. Vitamin A helps maintain normal vision and healthy skin, teeth, and tissue. Niacin, a B vitamin, can help regulate your cholesterol."
