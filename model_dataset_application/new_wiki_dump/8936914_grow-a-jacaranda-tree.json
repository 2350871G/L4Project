If you\u2019re planting your tree in a large planter or pot, place the jacaranda in a rich soil mixture. A local nursery or Garden center should have a variety of soil bags for sale, and sales staff can help you select a healthy mixture for your jacaranda. If you plant the tree directly into the ground, you\u2019ll have less control over the makeup of the soil than if you were buying it from a plant nursery.

Healthy jacaranda trees grow quickly, but will wilt and possibly die if given insufficient water. Between March and October, use a household hose to water the jacaranda tree about once a week. During the cooler winter months, you do not need to water the tree as regularly. The jacaranda will not be growing during November through February, and so you should only water the tree about once a month."

Jacarandas commonly reach between 25-50 feet (7.6-15 meters) in height and can have a width of 15-30 feet (4.5-9 meters). Plant the jacaranda in a large, open area where it will have room to grow to its full size. For example, jacarandas do well in large front or back yards. If you plant the jacaranda in an already cramped or crowded space (e.g. under a patio roof or between narrow walls) it will not grow to its full size and may wither and become unhealthy. Plant the tree at least 15-feet (4.5 meters) away from homes and other structures so that falling branches are less likely to cause damage."
