      "headline":"Figure out your style.",
      "description":"Do you like Picasso? What about exotic art? Maybe you like comfortable fireplace paintings or abstract art. Choose which one you like the most and think you would have fun drawing. Please know that your \"style\" is just something you love to draw, and you do not have to draw it all the time."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Sketch or doodle.",
      "description":"Fold up a paper and put it in your pocket in case you have any sudden  ideas during the day. Trace little pictures or letters. Doodle lightly in a diary or a journal. When you sketch, or doodle, you do not draw anything specific. Just do squiggly lines or shapes or shade in pictures. These drawings are just to draw, not for the picture."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Daydream.",
      "description":"Daydreaming can help you get ideas. Lots of people do it. Don't think; let your mind wander. Relax. Eventually, some pictures will come to you. Maybe try drawing some of your favorite things. Even if you think you will not draw it very good, be confident and keep trying! Practice makes perfect!"
    },
    {
      "headline":"Read.",
      "description":"The best books to read for inspiration are actually ones without pictures, so you can create your own pictures. Picture books are okay, too, but you can get really creative making up your own pictures in your head so you can draw them and share them with people!"
    },
    {
      "headline":"If you don't have anything yet, try the Internet.",
      "description":"Online at school, home, or the library, or wherever there is a computer, look up some pictures. Don't necessarily copy the pictures, just use them for inspiration. Look up one of your favorite foods or people. Maybe you want to see a picture of the Eiffel Tower. Who knows? You choose."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Remember to be confident when you are drawing.",
      "description":"Remember, you are your worst critic, so if you don't like it, chances are, everyone else will love it! A picture is worth a thousand words!"
