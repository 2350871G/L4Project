Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook the quinoa for 30 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and let the quinoa rest for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, remove the lid, stir the quinoa, and set it aside to cool for at least an hour."

Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the eggs for six minutes. Remove the eggs from the water with a slotted spoon and run them under cold water to stop the cooking process.

Process the ingredients for one to two minutes, until the mixture is smooth and all the ingredients are incorporated. For some extra heat, add 2 teaspoons (10 g) of Dijon mustard to the dressing as well. If you don\u2019t have a blender, mince the garlic and ginger and combine all the ingredients in a small bowl.

Drizzle the dressing over the ingredients and toss everything together to coat the vegetables with the dressing. Add salt and pepper to taste, and stir to combine. Instead of cherry tomatoes, you can use beefsteak, heirloom, Roma, or other tomato varieties. With larger tomatoes, cut them into bite-sized chunks. Instead of arugula, you can use kale, lettuce, spinach, or any combination of leafy greens. Other additions you can make to this salad include a diced bell pepper, \u00bd cup (113 g) of cooked bacon, or \u00bd cup (75 g) of Prosciutto."
