          "description":"While there are many types of kits on the market for testing pool pH (including digital testers and litmus test strips), DPD test kits are among the most accurate. They are also very affordable compared to digital test kits. DPD test kits are available at most department and home supply stores. DPD kits contain a variety of chemicals that change color when mixed with pool water. These chemicals test different pool water qualities, such as pH, total alkalinity, chlorine and bromine levels, and water hardness. Different DPD kits come in different forms. For example, some use liquid reagents, while others use solid tablets. Liquid and tablet test kits are similar in their level of accuracy, but tablets may be easier to use because they do not require precise measurements of liquid reagents. While litmus strip kits are easier to use than DPD kits, DPD kits are more accurate when used correctly. Digital test kits have no obvious mechanism for indicating when test results are inaccurate (e.g., colors that do not match the test chart), so their results can be misleading. Many Digital pH testers do however allow them to be calibrated. If you do use a digital tester, get into the habit of double checking results from time to time with drop based reagents."

          "description":"To use a DPD test kit, you will be mixing different chemical reagents with samples of pool water. These chemicals change color when added to pool water, and you must consult the color chart to interpret the results. Read the directions closely to make sure you are using the test kit correctly and that you know how to interpret the results. Make sure you are using the correct reagent to test pH levels. Most kits use Phenol Red for this purpose."

          "description":"Most pool pH testers appear more yellow at low pH levels(Below 6.8), and redder at high pH (Above 8.2) levels. However, if your pool water contains very high levels of chlorine(Above 10ppm Chlorine) or bromine, this may interfere with the test and cause it to give unusual results, e.g., turning purple. Very low alkalinity in your pool may also cause the test to give incorrect results. To minimize these problems, test your pool\u2019s chlorine, bromine, and total alkalinity levels before testing pH. Test kits can also give incorrect results if the reagents are stored improperly (e.g., in humid areas or extreme temperatures), or become cross-contaminated due to careless handling."

The CDC recommends testing twice a day or even more often at times when your pool is being used every day or by many people throughout the day. Pool pH needs to be checked more frequently when the pool is getting a lot of use, because anything that gets into the pool water (including natural oils from swimmers\u2019 hair and bodies, traces of sunscreen and other body care products, or dirt that gets tracked into the pool) will affect the water\u2019s chemical makeup."
