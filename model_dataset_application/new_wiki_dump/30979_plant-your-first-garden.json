The beds can be of any size, but are typically 3 or 4 feet (0.91 or 1.22 m) wide and 12 inches (30 cm) high. Fill your raised beds with gardening soil obtained from your local farm and garden shop. Garden beds make your plants inaccessible to many pests and animals, and can minimize the growth of weeds and soil compaction, too. Raised beds are also an elegant solution in cases where your soil is rocky or too shallow to grow in."

This will better help you determine what you have space for and whether you need to scale back your garden ambitions. If your garden area covers a large space, be sure to mark paths through the garden grid map to enable access to everything you\u2019re growing."

Once you\u2019ve decided what you want to grow, visit your local garden supply shop to get some seeds. Choose top-shelf seeds to improve your odds of a healthy garden.
