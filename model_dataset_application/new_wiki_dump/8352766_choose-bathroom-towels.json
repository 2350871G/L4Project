It can be hard to tell which towels will remain soft over the long term. After they\u2019re washed, towels tend to lose their softness. However, towels made of rayon tend to be quite soft. Towels of high-quality Pima or Egypt cotton are also very soft. Turkish cotton is also exceptionally soft. You might be able to increase the softness of your towels with fabric softener, but they will become more flammable and less absorbent. The softest towels are often made with long-staple or extra-long-staple (ELS) cotton. Turkish, Pima, and Egyptian cottons tend to be ELS or long-staple cottons, as are Supima or MicroCotton fabrics."

Cotton towels, or towels made of a cotton/polyester hybrid thread, are more durable than those of rayon. However, cotton/polyester towels are less absorbent than those of pure cotton. A durable towel should last about 10 years or more. Towels using long-staple or extra-long-staple (ELS) cotton are stronger than those of regular cotton. Most towels made with Turkish, Egyptian, Pima, Supima, or MicroCotton are ELS or long-staple cotton. Towels of combed cotton are composed of cotton which is combed before use to remove shorter threads and other undesirable bits. This combing process leaves behind only the strongest cotton and prevents pilling."
