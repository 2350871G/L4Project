  "text":" Setting Up Your Shot Understand the role refraction plays in your final shot. As with any other crystal, what makes the crystal ball so fascinating is the way that it refracts light and images. Refraction is what explains the upside-down image that you see on the ball. Decide on your subject. The most popular themes for this are landscape, portrait, flower, and architecture. The best way is to walk around with the ball and look through it. You will get your best ideas that way. You could see a tree that you never thought of using. Look around. Don't shoot it from the ground. Most of the time that won't work. You need to have it lifted high enough that subjects are a distance away so you can photograph them through the ball. If you take your photos on the ground, what you will get is grass - lots of grass. Try to shoot from above your subject. The angle will vary depending on what you are shooting. Position the ball in the shade. While your target can be in the sun, you want your ball to be in the shade, if at all possible. Position yourself, so the sun or light is behind you. It should be lighting whatever your ball is 'aimed.' Light the subject, not the ball if you must use extra light. There will be fewer hotspots. It is much better to use ambient light, instead of artificial light. Find a good location to place your ball. You could put it on a stand, a bottle cap, a shallow puddle, a hand, a fence, just about anything that will support it. Take advantage of any natural divots in whatever you are using to support the ball. Taking the Shot Look through the ball and fill it up with your intended shot. You will need to get relatively close to it. Understand that that distance will vary. For instance, the relative distance that a flower will require is very different from what a city line will require. This shot has something that could be interesting (the baby), but it takes up too small a space in the image. Start with an aperture of approximately F4. You want enough so that most of your subject in the ball is in focus. You should try to keep it between F4 and F8. In this way, you will blur the background while allowing the ball to be mostly in focus. Once the ball is in place, move around and look at different perspectives. If your subject isn't large enough in the ball, move the ball. Angle is everything when shooting crystals of any type. Start taking photographs.

Practice. You will not pick up your camera and your crystal ball and make this stunning shot. Unless you are lucky or fairly skilled. Shooting a Landscape with the Crystal Ball Set up the crystal ball with the sun behind you but lighting your subject.  Place your crystal ball in the shade. You will want your target in the sun, but your ball needs to be in the shade. Ensure that, wherever you place the crystal ball, it is secure.  Focus on the ball until it is sharp. You will need an aperture of F4 to F8 to get the clarity that you want. Your background will be pretty out of focus. Decide on how much you want to show in your shot. Do you want just the ball with the landscape, or do you want your landscape to show as well? Experiment with landscape ideas: Make sure the landscape in the ball lines up with the actual landscape.
