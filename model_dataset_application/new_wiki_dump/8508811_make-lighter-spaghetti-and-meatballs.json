Chicken still has all the nutrients of beer or pork, but with a lower fat content. You will need a \u00bd pound of ground chicken breast to serve four people a meal of spaghetti and chicken meatballs. To make chicken meatballs, combine:\n\u00bd pound ground chicken breast\n1 small onion\n4 garlic cloves\n1 \u00be teaspoons Italian seasoning\n1 \u00be teaspoons salt\n1 tablespoon grated parmesan cheese\n\u00bd egg, slightly scrambled\n\u00bc cup panko breadcrumbs"

Go for lean beef that has an 8% fat content or less. This way, you still get beef in the dish without the extra calories. Substitute lean beef for regular beef or pork in an existing spaghetti and meatballs recipe. You will need about 1 pound of lean beef to make a spaghetti and meatballs meal for six."

Try adding mushrooms or spinach to the meatballs for added nutrients. Then, cut back on the meat content so the meatballs are leaner. You can also add fresh herbs like parsley to the meatballs to cut down on the meat content."

To make lentil meatballs, you will need access to a food processor or a blender. To make the lentil meatballs:\nSaute 1 shallot, minced and 3 cloves minced garlic in 3 tablespoons olive oil. Combine the cooked shallot and garlic with:\n1 egg\n1 1/2 cup cooked green lentils\n1 1/2 tablespoon Italian seasoning, such as dried basil and oregano\n1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\nSea salt and black pepper to taste"

Baking the meatballs in the oven can keep them from getting too heavy with oil. Place the meatballs on parchment paper and bake them in the oven until they are cooked through. If you want the meatballs to have a crispness to them, you may take them out of the oven early and saute them in olive oil in a pan. Only saute them lightly to keep the fat content down."

Choose a whole-grain spaghetti when shopping for pasta for the dish. Or make your own whole-grain spaghetti at home. You can also try using pasta made with rice, beans, quinoa, or egg whites.

Use a vegetable spiralizer or the spiral setting on your food processor to make noodles out of vegetables like zucchini or carrots. Vegetable noodles are much healthier than pasta made from grains and add nutrients to the dish. You may try making zucchini and carrot noodles and combining them together to make a healthy meal of vegetable spaghetti and meatballs. This is a good option if you are allergic to wheat or grains, but still want to enjoy spaghetti and meatballs."

          "description":"Avoid overdoing it on the amount of pasta you prepare for a meal. Making a healthy amount will ensure you can fill the remainder of your plate with vegetables or healthy meatballs. One cup of cooked pasta per person is often enough and well within the healthy amount. One cup of cooked pasta contains 200 calories, making it a healthy option for a meal. Try starting with one cup of cooked pasta per person and balance it out with the meatballs for a light, but satisfying meal."

To make a simple spaghetti sauce, combine:\n1 18 ounce can diced tomatoes\n2-3 fresh tomatoes, diced\n2-3 cloves garlic, minced\n1 tablespoon olive oil\nOregano and parsley to taste\nYou can also buy spaghetti sauce at the supermarket that has no sugar or added salt."

You can also buy pesto pre-made at the store and use it in your spaghetti and meatballs dish. You can keep the dish really simple and healthy with no sauce, just olive oil and a light dash of Parmesan cheese."
