          "description":"Succulents and cacti need well-draining soil. You can purchase cactus soil that is already mixed. Put your succulent or cactus in a pot with drainage holes then put it in the cactus soil. If you want to put your succulent or cactus in something besides a regular pot, layer the bottom of the container with pebbles before you put the plant and soil inside. This will provide drainage for the plant."

          "description":"Succulents and cactus can go a long time without water, but they do need water to survive and grow. Water your plants only when the soil is completely dry, to avoid killing it by overwatering. It is better to under-water cacti than it is to overwater them. Pour the water on the soil, not on the plants itself, to avoid rot."

          "headline":"Make sure the plants have sunlight.",
          "description":"Succulents and cacti do best in bright indirect sunlight. Experiment with different spots near windows to see where your plants thrive. If you notice your plants withering, meaning the leaves look yellow or transparent, move them to a brighter spot. Make sure your plants are not getting sunburned from too much light. In the northern hemisphere, succulents tend to burn near south facing windows. You can move your plants to an east facing window if they are getting too hot."

          "description":"Succulents like to be warm in the summer (between 70\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 Fahrenheit, or 21\u00b0-27\u00b0 Celsius) and cool in the winter (between 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 Fahrenheit, or 10\u00b0-16\u00b0 Celsius). Most succulents can handle temperatures higher or lower than that, but don\u2019t let the plants get below freezing. If you keep your plants next to a window, you probably won\u2019t have to worry about the temperature too much, be cautious in the winter and move your plant away from the window if the window area gets too cold."

If you don\u2019t use a well-draining soil mix and don\u2019t let your plants dry out completely between watering them, you might get gnats (very small flies). Another bug that likes to attack succulents is mealy bugs (white, fuzzy bugs with many legs). If you notice any mealy bugs, spray your plants with rubbing alcohol and pour rubbing alcohol over the soil to kill any eggs."

If you want to grow herbs together, put two or three in a pot that is 8 inches deep and 10 inches in diameter. You can grow different kinds of herbs in the same pot, but don\u2019t mix herbs that have different watering schedules, different soil needs, or are very different sizes."

Sage, basil, oregano, bay, thyme, and rosemary like well-drained soil. You can buy potting soil that stays damp for longer or well-drained soil that stays dry at a gardening store. For growing rosemary, thyme, and basil, add eggshells to your soil. Put the eggshells in a food processor with water and add them to your soil."

Place the lights very close to the herbs (about four to six inches away). Brown spots on the foliage means the herbs are getting too much light. Plants with long stems and very few leaves are not getting enough light and need more."

To water your herbs put them in the sink and water the base where the stem and dirt meet. Let the water soak through. When the herbs are drained completely, put them back on the saucers.
