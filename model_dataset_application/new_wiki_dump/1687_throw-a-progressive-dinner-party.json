          "description":"The most important part of any dinner party is the people who attend, and a progressive dinner party is no different! If you\u2019re planning an evening for the people on your block, make sure you remember to invite everyone. If you\u2019re simply aiming for a cozy evening with friends, try to pick folks who know each other or will mesh well. Consider the size of the homes you expect to host the party. Most houses can\u2019t seat more than twelve comfortably, and many apartments are even smaller than that. Plan accordingly. If you want to throw a big party (maybe for the neighborhood or a large club), consider splitting the guests into teams of a manageable size (six to twelve). Then, pick hosts and plan parallel dinners for each team."

When selecting your hosts, you may want to ask yourself different questions about them, including\u2026\n...are their homes of similar sizes? Will they all be able to accommodate your guests? ...are they reliable? You want hosts who will remember the party and put effort into their part. ...are they in walking distance of one another? Alternately, do they have enough parking spaces around their homes that guests could drive or carpool? ...are their houses ADA-accessible? If you have guests with mobility restrictions, it\u2019s best to make sure they can get into the houses they visit. ...are they good at cooking anything in particular?
