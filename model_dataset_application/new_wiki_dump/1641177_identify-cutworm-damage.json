          "description":"Most species of cutworms feed from the ground, where they mow down plants by chewing through their stems. In some cases, they will attack the roots and cut down the plant below the soil level. Check for toppled plants that have been cut of at or near the bottom. Some species of cutworms will also crawl up into the plant and damage leaves and stems near the top, especially during the summer months."

If you notice a wilted plant, check the base of the stem for cuts or notches.Did you know? Cutworms primarily attack food crops, such as cabbages, lettuce, corn, beans, peas, carrots, potatoes, and tomatoes. Some also eat grass."

If you have a densely planted area, such as a field with some type of crop growing in it, look out for bald patches. These may indicate a cutworm infestation. These bare patches are most likely to show up on hilltops and south-facing slopes. If you do see bare patches, closely examine the surrounding plants. Look for plants that are cut off at the stem or have notches chewed into them."

You might also spot some of them on the leaves if the cutworms have crawled up higher onto the plant. These droppings can help you distinguish cutworm damage from slug damage. Slug droppings are sludgy, slimy, and S-shaped."

Check for fairly plain, grubby-looking caterpillars that roll up into a \u201cC\u201d or a tight circle.Keep in mind: Cutworms do most of their damage while they\u2019re still small, around 0.5\u20130.7 inches (13\u201318 mm). By the time they reach a length of about 1.2\u20131.4 inches (3.0\u20133.6 cm), they won\u2019t pose as much of a threat to your garden or crops.

Cutworms do most of their feeding late in the day or during the night, so you may be able to catch them in action if you check during those times. You may find the cutworms on the ground at the base of the plant or munching on leaves and stems higher up."

If you see possible cutworm damage, use your hand or a trowel to turn over the soil and any loose clumps of dirt or debris around the damaged plants. This should help you turn up any cutworms. Check in a 1 foot (30 cm) radius around the damaged plant. Cutworms can sometimes hide fairly deep in the soil. The more mature larvae of some species may dig down 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) under the dirt."

Consider using a pesticide such as carbaryl, cyfluthrin, or permethrin.Tip: One relatively gentle natural pesticide is diatomaceous earth. This powdery substance is not toxic, but it kills insects by drying out and damaging their exoskeletons. Try sprinkling some around the bases of your plants to kill any cutworms that come near. For the best results, apply any pesticides in the late afternoon, when cutworms tend to start becoming active. Be aware that pesticides can also harm beneficial insects, such as butterflies. Only use this approach if you feel you absolutely have to."
