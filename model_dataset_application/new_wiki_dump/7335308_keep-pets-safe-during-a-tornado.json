It is essential that you have a plan in place, and the first step is defining where your safe zone is located. A purpose-build tornado shelter is ideal, but a section of the basement or a windowless interior room on the ground floor will also work. A small, enclosed room is good because it may reduce the amount of falling or flying debris, but make sure all members of the household and their emergency supplies can fit within the space. Indoors is normally better than outdoors, but mobile homes and trailers are not built to withstand tornadoes. Identify a place of shelter nearby that you can use."

In addition to human supplies, make a storm shelter kit for your pets as well. It is a good idea to have a crate ready to go in the safe zone, so \u2014 for a dog, for instance \u2014 consider filling it with supplies like:\na dog first-aid kit; disposable bowls; a familiar blanket; a harness, leash, and muzzle; plastic poop bags; any medication your dog takes; immunization records; food, water, and treats for several days or (if possible) up to two weeks. For a cat, include a supply of litter and a scoop, and a small litter box if possible. Regularly check expiration dates on stockpiled food and medications."

The easier it is for someone else to identify your pet, the more likely it is that you\u2019ll be reunited. A secure, sturdy, clearly labeled identification collar (that is worn at all times) is an essential first step. However, remember that an embedded microchip cannot fall off during a tornado. Strongly consider having a chip with identifying information implanted in your pets. Also carry photos of your pets on your person and in your phone."

Scared animals tend to have favorite hiding spots, so take note of any places where your pets tend to go during a typical thunderstorm. That way you can quickly locate them and get them to safety. Bring your pets inside (if they\u2019re not there already) anytime a thunderstorm approaches. If there is a severe thunderstorm warning or a tornado watch posted for your area, strongly consider heading for your safe zone. If there is a tornado warning, go there immediately. In U.S. meteorological nomenclature, \u201cwatch\u201d means the conditions are ripe for the event, while \u201cwarning\u201d means that type of weather has been spotted in the area.

Make sure every person and pet is accounted for and knows where to go and what to do. If your pets have been trained to recognize and obey commands, teach a command like \u201cshelter\u201d or \u201cstorm.\u201d  Dogs can probably be trained to head for the safe zone on command; cats may be able to be prodded to enter a carrier to take to the safe zone."

Tornadoes can cause catastrophic damage that leaves both humans and pets stunned and disoriented. Such disorientation will cause additional fear and anxiety in your pets, which may in turn lead to unusual or reckless behavior. Keep your pets in their carriers or leashed in the aftermath of the storm; they may get frightened and try to run away or hide. Watch for broken glass; protruding nails or sharp debris; unstable walls, floors, or entire structures; gas leaks; and downed power lines.

Adding small, familiar comforts can ease at least a bit of this anxiety for your pets. Make sure to include some toys, treats, blankets, and similar comfort items in your shelter. Keep your pet occupied with play, training, or other everyday activities as much as is possible. Try not to express your own anxiety or be overly comforting toward your pet; act as though sheltering through an actual tornado is just as normal and safe as one of your drills.

There are ways to recognize and address such phobias in pets, and treatments are typically most effective when started early in life. Watch for signs of excessive storm fears in younger pets, and take note especially if a pet loses body control, becomes destructive, or risks injury to itself or others.

Try playing an audio clip of storm sounds at a very low volume, and immediately offer a treat and praise if your pet does not respond negatively. If the pet responds negatively, don\u2019t use punishment; simply try again another time. Each day following a positive result, increase the volume and duration of the storm sounds a bit.

Some medications will provide long-lasting benefits during the entirety of the storm season, while others are meant to be used right before a triggering event occurs. Clomicalm or Reconcile, to name some common examples, may be prescribed for use throughout the storm season. Fast-acting medications like Valium and Xanax, alternatively, might be prescribed for use during individual events.
