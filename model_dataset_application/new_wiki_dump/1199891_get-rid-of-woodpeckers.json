          "description":"If woodpeckers repeatedly make holes in your home, chances are they're doing so for good reason. Your home may be harboring an insect population, such as bees, ants, or termites, and providing an inviting atmosphere for woodpeckers. Taking action to remove the food your home is providing is the first step to getting rid of woodpeckers. Go to your attic or the area of your house closest to where the woodpecker has been pecking. Look for dead insects lying on the windowsills and in corners. Check for bees' nests in the rafters. Look for loose, rotting wood both inside and outside the house. These are all signs of an insect infestation. If you see signs of an insect infestation, take measures to get it treated right away. Use a  natural method to get rid of the insects or call an exterminator to take care of the problem."

          "description":"Woodpeckers like to feed on suet, which is made from the fat of a cow and is available for purchase at wild bird or pet stores. Hang the feeder well away from the ground so the suet doesn't get eaten by other creatures. Place the feeder close to the place on your home where the woodpeckers tend to peck. They'll notice the suet and may start feeding there instead. Gradually move the feeder away from your home, a few feet each day, until it's well away from your house. Hopefully you will have trained the woodpeckers to feed on the suet, rather than drumming on your house. Suet can melt in hot weather and coat birds' wings, damaging their plumage. Don't use suet during the hottest days of summer. Keep the suet available throughout the fall, winter and spring months, when food is most scarce. Don't do this unless you deal with the insect problem first - otherwise you'll just be attracting more woodpeckers to the feast!"

Use strips 3 or 4 feet (0.91 or 1.2 m) long, attached so that one end dangle and move in the wind. If the birds are pecking on your siding, attach several strips a few feet apart. Keep in mind that the tape deteriorates over time, and only works when there's wind to move it. Hang a flag or decoration near the area for a more visually appealing solution. A windsock or windmill that moves quickly when the wind blows may work to scare woodpeckers away. Sound-based deterrents such as ultrasonic recordings of a woodpecker in distress or with predator sounds, have been tested and proven to have no effect at all, at least on Pileated woodpeckers. Place several wind chimes on and around your house. The noise from these chimes may possibly discourage woodpecker visitors. If a Hairy woodpecker, Lewis\u2019 woodpecker, Red-bellied Woodpecker or Northern Flicker is trying to nest in your home, attaching a nesting box where they are pecking (or very close by) will give them a better home. Be sure to pack it full of wood chips in February or March so they can fulfill their instinctive drive to excavate. These woodpeckers are the only ones know to use man-made nest boxes for nesting."
