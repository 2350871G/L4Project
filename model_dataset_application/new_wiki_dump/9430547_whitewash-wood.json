          "description":"Remove any stickers or unwanted nails from the wood. If it is dirty, wash the wood with  gentle soap and water. If the wood is very rough, use sandpaper or a hand sander to smooth it. A smoother surface will make it easier to apply the whitewash. If you need to use soap, make sure the wood dries completely before you begin to whitewash."

          "description":"Staining the wood a medium or dark brown, will help the texture and knots of the wood to shine through. The paint and water technique works best on new lumber or wood with a very smooth surface. Staining the wood can help the final product to appear more weathered and aged, if that is the look you desire. The darker the stain you use, the more visible the wood will be under the whitewash. Let the stain dry completely before you begin to whitewash the wood."

        {
          "headline":"Mix equal parts paint and water until the paint is semi-transparent.",
          "description":"Add more water if the paint is still too thick or opaque. Thinning the paint with water will allow the wood grain to show through after you apply the white paint. A latex (water-based) paint is usually the easiest type of paint to use for whitewashing; you can also buy white stains at your local paint or hardware store. However, these may still need to be diluted with water to allow the wood grain to show. The ratio of paint to water can be changed depending on how transparent you want the whitewash to be. If you want a lot of the wood to show through, add 2 parts of water to 1 part of paint. You might want to start with a 1:1 ratio, and then add more water if the paint is not as transparent as you desire."

          "headline":"Use a clean rag, foam roller, or paint brush to apply the whitewash.",
          "description":"Use long, even strokes to spread the whitewash on the wood. Because the whitewash has been diluted with water, it will dry much quicker than normal paint. If you have a large piece of wood or furniture, you should work on small sections rather than attempting to cover the entire area at one time. Apply the whitewash in the direction of the wood grain. This will help the wood grain to show through."

          "headline":"Remove the excess whitewash with a paper towel or clean rag.",
          "description":"Allow the paint to sit for 3-4 minutes, and then wipe the excess paint off with the paper towel or rag. You should wipe in the direction of the grain. Use long, fluid, and even wiping motions to remove the paint. The longer you leave the paint on the wood before wiping the excess off, the whiter the wood will become. If you want the wood to be mostly white with only a bit of wood showing through, leave the paint on for longer than 3-4 minutes. The exact amount of time that you leave the paint on the wood can vary depending on the type of wood, the age of the wood, and the weather. Use the 3-4 minutes as a guide, but check the paint frequently. As soon as it begins to feel tacky, the paint should be removed."

If you want a bright, very white finished product, you may need 4-5 layers. If you want more of the wood to shine through, 1-3 layers will be sufficient."

If there is a particular knot in the wood grain that you want to highlight, rub the candle over it. Rub the wax randomly over the wood.
