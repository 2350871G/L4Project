If you know someone who enjoys strategy-based board games, invite them to join you in a couple rounds. To get other players in on the action, consider holding a Pai Sho tournament or playing a series of games with a \u201cwinner stays\u201d format. If you\u2019re playing an online version of the game, such as the popular Skud Pai Sho, you have the option of either starting a game with a friend or squaring off against the computer.

          "description":"In a game of Pai Sho, players take turns arranging various tile pieces to form \u201charmonies.\u201d A harmony is formed when a player places 2 harmonious flower tiles in an uninterrupted line along any of the board\u2019s intersecting lines. The first player to successfully create a predetermined number of harmonies on the board is the winner. While it is possible to capture your opponent\u2019s tiles in Pai Sho, the idea behind doing so is to keep them from forming harmonies rather than to collect the pieces themselves. In Skud Pai Sho, the object is to create an unbroken \u201charmony ring\u201d that encircles the center of the board."

At the center of the board is a diamond-shaped section divided into 4 quadrants, 2 white and 2 red, arranged opposite one another. Physical fan-made replicas of the game are also available for purchase online. These typically range in price from $30-200, depending on the size and quality of the materials used.Tip: If you\u2019re the crafty type, you could also try making your own custom board using materials like wood, cardboard, and paint or colored markers."

The gate closest to you is your \u201chome\u201d gate, while the gate closest your opponent is the \u201cforeign\u201d gate. When you and your opponent are positioning properly, you should each have an open gate to your right and left.

The basic flower tiles serve as the game\u2019s primary movement pieces. They are broken up into 2 groups: white (Jasmine, White Lily, White Jade) and red (Rose, Chrysanthemum, Rhododendron). Jasmine tiles can move up to 3 spaces at a time in a single direction. This tile will always start within your home gate. White Lily tiles move 2 spaces vertically and 2 spaces horizontally to form an \u201cL\u201d shape. You can start this tile in either of the open gates on the left or right edges of the board. White Jade tiles can move up to 5 spaces at a time in a single direction. This tile can either be started at your home gate or inside the \u201cmid gate\u201d (the centerpoint of the board), depending on how you prefer to play. Rose tiles can move up to 3 spaces at a time in a single direction. When added to the board, they\u2019ll always start inside the foreign gate (your opponent\u2019s home gate). Chrysanthemum tiles move 2 spaces vertically and 2 spaces horizontally to form an \u201cL\u201d shape. You can start this tile in either of the open gates on the left or right edges of the board. Rhododendron tiles can move up to 5 spaces at a time in a single direction. This tile can either be started at your home gate or inside the mid gate."

You can only play one of these tiles during a harmony bonus, which you\u2019ll be rewarded with anytime you successfully form a new harmony. The Rock tile cancels harmonies along any lines its placed on. You can place this tile at any open point on the board. Once a Rock tile has been planted, it can\u2019t be captured or moved, even by a Wheel. The Wheel tile rotates all adjacent tiles 1 space, unless doing so would move them off the board or into a gate. You can place this tile at any open point on the board. The Knotweed tile cancels harmonies in surrounding adjacent spaces by \u201cchoking\u201d the flower tiles. If you\u2019re playing on a physical board, flip the affected tiles over to show that they\u2019ve been neutralized. You can place this tile at any open point on the board. The Boat tile can either move a flower tile to any other point on the board (taking that tile\u2019s place in the process) or remove an opponent\u2019s accent tile (disappearing from the board along with it). You can only play this tile on other tiles. The White Dragon tile removes active tiles from the board if it lands directly on them. You can place this tile at any open point on the board and move it in either 1 or 6 spaces in any direction on each turn. The White Lotus tile can turn harmonies into disharmonies and disharmonies into harmonies.
