          "description":"This feature should be clearly indicated on the label of potential pork chops, but in the event it is not, simply inquire with your butcher which pork chops are pasture raised. These cuts will be available at most butchers and groceries. In some cases, pasture raised pork can be a little more expensive than other varieties. If you're on a budget, you might want to avoid this kind of meat. Pasture raised pork generally has a better consistency, taste, and quality than \"farm raised\" pork, which usually refers to pigs raised and processed in an industrial style of butchery."

          "headline":"Opt for thicker cuts to prevent dryness.",
          "description":"Much of the pork available today is raised to be as lean as possible, which can cause your meat to become easily overcooked. Thicker pork chops will retain moisture better, so you might want to ask for a double-cut for your chops, or specify you want yours at least 1\u00bd inches (3.8 cm) thick. Bone-in cuts also help prevent the loss of moisture when cooking. If you find you have a problem with dryness in your chops, bone-in cuts may help with the problem."

          "headline":"Ensure marbling by checking the meat.",
          "description":"At most butchers, you'll have the option to look over the meat you plan on buying to inspect its quality. The most important feature for you to look for at this point is called \"marbling,\" which is the presence of veins of white fat in the meat. Ideal pork chops will have a small amount of marbling throughout the chop and no yellow fat. Fat not only helps retain moisture in your meat, it also enriches the flavor of it. If you dislike fatty meat, you can always cut the fat out after it has been cooked."

          "headline":"Choose pink chops that are well packaged.",
          "description":"The meat of your chops should be light pink in color. They should be wrapped in clean packaging that has no holes or tears. The packaging itself should have little to no leakage, and the tray in which the meat is presented should also have little to no fluid. If you notice discoloration, like a graying or browning in your pork chops, your meat has already started to spoil. Smell is a great indicator of freshness. If you notice a sour, unpleasant, rotten, or decaying odor, your chops have spoiled and should be thrown away. Check the sell-by date on the packaging of your pork chops. If your meat has passed this date, it may be safest to throw the meat away."

However, you can also pan cook it regularly, so long as you tenderize it first. Due to the fact that this cut is rich in fat and other connective tissue, moist, high heat works best when cooking. You may be more familiar with the shoulder cut by one of its other names: the blade chop, blade-end pork loin chop, or pork steak."

There will be a bone running along one side of this cut that is often covered in a thin layer of fat. This cut will be relatively lean and have a mild flavor. Since rib chops are a leaner cut, quick cook methods work well to seal in moisture in the meat. These include grilling, broiling, sear-roasting, and more. You'll find that rib chops are among the more tender cuts of pork chop you can buy. If tenderness is your preference, rib chops should be near the top of your list."

A t-bone will divide the loin meat from the tenderloin meat, and since these meats cook at different rates, you'll have to keep a close eye on them while cooking. The meat will be lean and have a mild flavor of pork. This cut of meat, also being on the lean side, will benefit from quick cooking methods like grilling, broiling, sear-roasting. If you purchase top loin chops, these cuts will not have tenderloin meat included."

In these cases, a boneless pork chop will work perfectly. Expect the meat to be lean, and the flavor to be mild. Boneless pork chop cuts are also known by as an America's cut or a pork loin fillet. These cuts will have very little marbling, fat, and connective tissue, which means there will be a greater risk of overcooking. For this cut, you should consider brining your pork chop."

It has a very strong pork flavor and, as the meat can be tough, it should be slow cooked to encourage tenderness. Slow, moist heat will best break down the tissues in a sirloin chop, softening the tough meat into a delicious meal. Keep this cut in mind for braises and stews."
