Allocate a set period of cleaning or \"decluttering\" time each day or each week. Try setting an alarm clock. Designate a cleaning chunk of, say, twenty minutes each day or two hours each week. Set the alarm for the appropriate time so that you can throw all of your attention into the act of cleaning. If you are thinking about what you need to do afterward, then you may not get as much cleaning done in this moment. Try playing music while you declutter your space. Make it a cleaning party!

Make sure that at any given moment, you are performing the task that feels the most important. The most important task in a given moment may be cleaning, or it may be your job, or it may be taking time for yourself. Remember that you must sometimes put small things in order so that you can clear the way for big things. Do not forget to maintain perspective. Remind yourself that irrelevant things can feel very pressing when you are swept up in the moment. Keep your priorities straight."

Speak to your friends, or post photos of items on social media. Put things out on the curb. Consider having a garage sale. Post online. Sell used goods on eBay, Craigslist, and other online marketplaces. Give things away using sites like http://www.freecycle.org/\n\n\nDonate. Arrange a pickup from your local donation center, or bring boxes of things in to a local thrift store. Find a Goodwill store in your area: these centers will usually sift through large amounts of unsolicited used goods."

If you are emotionally attached to a thing, but you rarely use it, then it may be worth relegating it to a less visible corner of your life. For easy reference, make sure to keep a master list of everything that you store away. Pay for extra storage elsewhere. This can be a solid solution if you're keeping furniture or other large objects that you may need in the future. Weigh the cost of the storage unit against the benefits of keeping the item. Store the items in attics, basements, and other out-of-the-way places. Sort things into labeled boxes: e.g. \"Christmas decorations\" or \"Family photos.\" Make sure that you can easily reach thing that you'll need to access with any regularity. Create cheap storage solutions within your rooms using cardboard boxes and wrapping paper for decoration. Decorate the boxes in any way you want, to match the d\u00e9cor of your rooms. With a little creativity and flair, you can even add to a room's overall look and feel. Store a decorative box beneath a bed, couch, chair, or table."
