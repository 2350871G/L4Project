This factor can be particularly important for baked goods that are baked in loaves, cakes or any single, whole shape. Check the size of your oven to make sure that the baking pans you select will fit inside. Look at your recipes to see what sizes of baking pans are called for, i.e. 9 x 13 inches, etc. Having the specific size will save you from complicated recipe alterations if you need to make sure that your preparations will fit the pan."
