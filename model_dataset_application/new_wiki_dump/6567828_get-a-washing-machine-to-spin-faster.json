If your machine detects an uneven load, it may bypass your selected spin speed for a slower one to avoid damage due to vibration. A good portion of machines can attempt to rebalance an uneven load, but will still drop to a slower speed, if these attempts fail. This is the most common cause of slow spinning. These features include motor torque, RPM detection, and drum weight detection."

These are rarely the cause of slow spinning, so you may want to try balancing the load first anyway."
