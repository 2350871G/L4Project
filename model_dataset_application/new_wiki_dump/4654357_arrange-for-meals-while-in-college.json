For one meal, you could simply eat ramen noodles, for another, eat breakfast for dinner-a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with cereal won't be that bad for dinner. Consider buying a crockpot. All you need to do is place spaghetti in there for one night and perhaps frozen, pre-sliced vegetables, hot sauce, and meat of your choice with pasta another night-and dinner is ready!"
