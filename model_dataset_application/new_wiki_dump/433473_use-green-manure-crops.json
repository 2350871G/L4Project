Legume seeds are the best choice - look for alfalfa, clover or lupins. Generally good seeds for green manure crops: Alfalfa, cereal rye, agricultural mustard and Banner fava beans. Specialized seeds: Alsike clover (for very deficient soils); fodder radish (for deep nutrient retrieval and a huge amount of green manure); wooly pod vetch (hardy, good in dry and drought or for poor soils); foul maddummas beans (good with heat). Food producing seeds that double as green manure: Barley, oats, hard red spring wheat, etc. Seeds suitable for cool season sowing: Fenugreek, fava bean, oats, lupin, woolly pod vetch and subclover. Seeds suitable for warm season sowing: Millet (French white or Japanese), mung bean, buckwheat, cowpea, lablab and soybean."

  "text":" Preparing the area in need of restoration Select an area of the garden where you can grow the green crop. If you don't have a lot of space, consider leaving a garden bed fallow and growing the crop in place of your usual flowers or vegetables for one season. Weed the area well. Any weeds left will compete with the green manure crop. If the soil has deficiencies, correct these. However, do not correct nitrogen deficiency. If using legumes (the most commonly used crop for green manure), the soil should be approximately 6.5 to 7.6 pH. For the greatest benefit, compost the soil about 30 days prior to growing the green manure crop. Sowing the seeds Sow seed across the area chosen, in either late autumn (fall) or early winter. A good time to sow is early autumn, to catch the warm soil. Sow to a depth of about  two to three times the seed's width (or follow the packet instructions).
