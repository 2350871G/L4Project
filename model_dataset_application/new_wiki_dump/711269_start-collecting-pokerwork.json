If you're still keen but don't have these amounts to spend, keep an eye out in antique stores for smaller pieces that were once cluttering the lounge and sitting rooms of many an average family. Pieces such as memento boxes, paperweights, bookends, vases, plates, etc., can be found anywhere in the range from AUD $50 - $300."

Once the toothbrush has removed as much as possible, clean the entire piece with a rag that has been dampened in one part vinegar and two parts grapeseed oil. Wipe off excess liquid and repeat one week later (this gives the oil time to soak in). Adding oil regularly will keep a great shine on your pokerwork items."

      "description":"Pokerwork items deserve to be shown off. The ideal storage would be behind glass to prevent dust build-up, although large and elegant pieces are better off being placed in strategic positions around the house as artwork (polish regularly! )."
