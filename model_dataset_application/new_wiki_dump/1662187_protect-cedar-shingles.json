          "description":"Leaf buildup in your gutters will make water drainage an issue when it rains. If the water piles up too high, it can seep into your shingles and cause mold to rot your shingles. Get a ladder and wear some heavy gloves to climb up and remove excess leaves and branches from your gutters by hand. Clean each section of your gutters after heavy storms, or biweekly under regular weather conditions.Warning: If your roof has a steep pitch, avoid walking up it without wearing a safety line and harness. Attach your harness line to an anchor on your roof before walking on top of it. Never go on your roof when it's snowing or raining. Use a sturdy ladder and enlist a friend or family member to hold it in place while you climb up. Wear footwear with good traction to keep your footing when you're on the ladder or roof."

          "description":"If you see any larger pieces of debris or thick branches on your cedar roof, remove them by hand with a ladder as soon as you can. Climb up your ladder carefully and wear gloves before taking them down from your shingle roof by hand. If you allow debris or branches to rub against your roof, it can wear away sections of treated wood, leaving your shingles susceptible to moisture or rain water."

          "description":"Over time, moisture may cause mold or fungus to grow on or in between your shingles. To scrub it away, mix 3 ounces (85 g) of trisodium phosphate, 1 oz (28 g) of laundry detergent, 1 US qt (0.95 L) of bleach, and 3 US quarts (2.8 L) of warm water in a bucket. Scrub your moldy shingle lightly with a sponge or strong cloth, and let it air dry for 10-30 minutes before rinsing it with cold water. The cleaning solution that you're making is a skin, eye, and lung irritant. Wear a dust mask, protective eyewear, and rubber gloves when mixing and applying it. Don't use the phosphate if your shingles lead to a gutter that drops off to a storm drain. You can purchase trisodium phosphate in a cleaning supply, paint, or hardware store."

You can also opt to use a power washer to remove weaker layers of wood to improve the strength and appearance of your roof if you want. Fill your power washer with cold water and start on its lowest setting before covering each section of your shingles."

To prevent this, prepare to treat your shingles immediately after they've been installed by gathering the proper materials and buying your wood treatment ahead of time.

          "description":"You need to protect your cedar from sunlight, which can dry out your wood, and from precipitation, which can cause moisture buildup. For these reasons, opt for a treatment that blocks light and repels water. Read a bottle of wood treatment to see if it blocks UV rays and repels water before purchasing it. Get a stain treatment if you want to change the color of your cedar. In contrast, opt for a clear epoxy or oil to keep a natural look. You can also buy treatments that come mixed with paint to add some color to your home. If you buy a treatment with paint in it, opt for a darker color that will absorb sunlight and keep your heating costs down. Bleaching oil is a traditional coating for cedar shingles and is effective at protecting against moisture, mold, and mildew. However, it adds a gray color to the wood."

Use a natural angle-brush to cut corners and reach underneath the layers of your shingles. Cover each section of your wall or roof with your treatment and let it air dry. Depending on the brand of your treatment, you may need to apply multiple layers. Read the instructions on your particular bottle or canister to see if you need to mix or add anything to your treatment before using it."

          "description":"Use a paint or chemical sprayer to reach difficult sections or large surface areas with your treatment. To start, rinse the tank out with warm water if it isn't already clean and then fill it with your treatment. Turn your sprayer on and hold the nozzle 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm) away from the surface that you want to cover. Pull the trigger and move the hose horizontally across your wall to cover a row of shingles and repeat the process with the row beneath it.Warning: Only use your sprayer on a calm day with no wind. If it's windy outside when you use your sprayer, you'll risk covering yourself in the treatment when the wind knocks the chemicals around in the air. Treat your shingles before installing them if you're doing it yourself. This will ensure that you cover each portion of your shingles. If you've paid a company to install your shingles for you, ask about pre-treated shingles."
