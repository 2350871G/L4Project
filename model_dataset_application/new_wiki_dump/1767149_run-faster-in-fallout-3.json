This is especially pertinent for PC users, as the Caps Lock button can mean the difference between walking and running. Keeping the Caps Lock button activated should keep you running while you're using the directional keys. For console systems, ensuring you're pushing the control stick as far as it can go will maximize your speed. Again, this may sound painfully obvious, but there are rare cases where a controller may not be working to one's complete satisfaction."

Running up steep surfaces won't get you somewhere nearly as fast as smooth pavement. Outside of Washington DC, Fallout 3's open world is generally pretty easy to navigate, so try to make the most direct route to wherever you're going. At the same time, you should take care to avoid enemy-heavy areas; if you're trying to move as efficiently as possible, getting into fights will only serve to slow you down."

          "description":"As is true for all Bethesda RPGs, the type of armour you wear will have a notable effect on your movement speed. A light armour, like leather armour, will keep you moving briskly. Better still, you can go without armour completely for maximum speed. Also keep in mind that armour tends to have a big weight associated with it. Not only will wearing a heavy armour slow you down, the weight attached will bog down your weight capacity considerably. On the other hand, some sets of armour like Power Armour come with a Strength bonus, which in turn will help boost your weight capacity."

If you're finding your speed bogged down, try dropping or selling some of your supplies. Before too long, you should find your character running at a better rate. Aim to discard junk items and extra sets of armour, as they tend to be the heaviest items in the game."

A hefty portion of the game's not going to require constant use of weapons, so while you might want that extra bit of caution, in most cases it's unnecessary. You can holster your weapon by holding the Reload button. Keep in mind that two-handed weapons (e.g. rifles, flamethrowers) will slow you down more than one-handed weapons, like pistols. If you're still worried about downtime while you're drawing a weapon, you can get the Quick Draw perk, which will make the holster/draw process 50% faster."

You'll end up going faster, and you'll also get more Action Points for the VATS system. Keep in mind that an imbalanced character can incur its own challenges.

This technically counts as cheating, but if you're looking for a simple way of increasing speed, command codes are just the thing.
