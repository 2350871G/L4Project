  "text":" Playing a Planned Game Decide how many people will be playing and how many Barbies you will use.  Have everyone pick the dolls they would like to use.  Decide the setting of your game. What time period will your Barbies be in? Medieval times? The present? The distant future? Where will your Barbies be? A city? A small town? A remote forest? Decide what kind of lifestyle your Barbies will have. Are they going to be famous? A superhero? Will they be dirt poor or filthy rich? Or will they just be average citizens? Decide who they will live with. Will all of the Barbies live together? Will they live alone? Perhaps they each are married and/or live with kid(s). Find a scenario. Will they just be living out daily life? Is it the first day of a new school for one of your Barbies? Maybe there's a great quest to go on, or a new villain to defeat. While you do this, make a rough plan. Don't plan every detail, or it will become boring to play. Set up locations. If you have any furniture, whether it be homemade, for other dolls, or actual Barbie furniture, use it to set up the locations so that you know where each place is. If you don't have any furniture, just imagine it. You could also use common objects from around the house. Improvised Games Have everyone pick out a Barbie or two to start with. You can always pick up more as you go along. Set up a single starting location. You might want to set up one or two others as well. Begin. It doesn't really matter how you start. It could be either regular life, a holiday, or a twist. Figure out an event to use as a base as you go along. It doesn't really need to be a long event- or an exciting one for that matter. Just start with an event. Let your imagination guide you. If you have no ideas, then try planning something in detail instead. Single Person Games Pick out a Barbie or two. Keep in mind that you'll be playing every part. Set up a location. From here, you could either plan your game or improvise. Start playing. Once again, it doesn't matter how you start- just start. It will get the creativity flowing. Either follow your plan or come up with events as you go along. Surprise yourself! Half of the fun when playing with Barbies is the surprise and unexpectedness of what another person that you're playing with will say. If you play with yourself, you'll be in complete control, but don't let that stop you! Don't think about what you'll reply to yourself with, just reply! Use your great imagination. Barbies are more than just dolls if you use them creatively. Playing With Only a Few Barbies Figure out if you'll plan your game or improvise.  Pick a single Barbie to start with. Make sure you have at least one Barbie for everyone who's playing. If you don't have enough Barbies, use other dolls or toys. Or go play hopscotch. Or tag. Or with stuffed animals. Play as you normally would.  Continuing a Game That You're Bored With Give it some time. Don't wait too long, but wait long enough for you to regain interest in the game. Decide whether you'll plan it or improvise. You could go with what you had been doing before, whether it be a plan or just improvised actions. Actually play. You won't be able to continue the game unless you play it. Consider a time skip.
