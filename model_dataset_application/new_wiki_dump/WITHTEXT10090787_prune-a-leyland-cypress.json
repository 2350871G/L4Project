At the beginning of the growing season, look for the central, vertical branch at the plant\u2019s center. Select 3 or 4 of the side branches to keep as leaders. Use a pair of loppers to sever any other branches at the base. The branches you choose should be the biggest, strongest ones, spaced out evenly along the cypress\u2019 central branch."

Leave a few of the smaller, younger shoots on each main branch. Cutting off the oldest, longest side shoots can cause more thick growth around the main branches."
