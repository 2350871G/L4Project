Even if your recipe called for butter, this shouldn\u2019t happen if you reheat the caramel slowly and stir so it heats evenly. However, if you\u2019d like to be safe, go with water!

To test if the caramel is cool enough, put your hand just above the sauce. If it\u2019s still giving off heat but doesn\u2019t immediately make your hand feel steamy, you\u2019re good to go!"
