  "text":" Preparing the Dough Preheat your oven to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Wash the butter in cold water. Dip your hands in warm water so that the butter does not stick to your hands, and shape the butter into a ball. Washing the butter may seem odd, but it\u2019s an important tip. The process will both improve the texture of the cookies and make them easier to roll out. Place the butter into a mixing bowl. Add the granulated sugar and cream the butter and sugar together using either a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment that is set at medium speed. Add the orange zest and mix until the zest is incorporated into the mixture.  Add the egg yolks to the butter and sugar mixture. Turn the mixer speed to low and mix slowly until the eggs are just incorporated. Make sure not to over mix the yolks. Place the flour and salt into the mixing bowl. With your clean hands, mix the ingredients together until the dough forms a large ball. Shaping the Cookies Place the dough onto a work surface. Divide the dough into quarters. If the dough sticks to your work surface, then sprinkle the work surface with a bit of flour. You can also sprinkle your hands with flour to keep the dough from sticking to your skin. Pinch off 1/4 of each quarter. Roll the dough with your hands until you\u2019ve created a strand of dough that is about the width of a lead pencil. Bring the ends of the dough together to create a wreath shape. Overlap the ends of the dough slightly to create a small \u201cX.\u201d This will make the wreaths look as though they have a ribbon trailing from beneath them. Place a layer of colored sugar onto a plate or in a wide, shallow bowl.  Dip the wreaths in the egg whites.  Roll the wreaths in the colored sugar. Place the wreaths on the baking sheet that you\u2019ve lined with parchment paper. Baking and Serving the Cookies Bake the Berlinerkranzer for 15 to 20 minutes or until they are lightly browned. Make sure not to over-bake the Berlinerkranzer. You want to make sure that they have a softer texture, so take them out of the oven just as soon as they begin to brown around the edges. Remove the Berlinerkranzer from the oven. Place the baking sheet on your range top and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet. Serve the cookies with hot tea or with mulled wine. ",
