          "description":"Use 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of apple cider vinegar, 1 tablespoon (12 grams) of sugar, \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of dish soap, and \u20442 cup (120 mL) of warm water. Combine everything in a small bowl and place it in the infected room. Leave it overnight and clean it out in the morning. Repeat this process as many times as you need. The scent of the sugar and apple cider vinegar will attract the gnats to the bowl. When they get close to the bowl, the soap suds will trap them and pull them down into the water.Tip: You can also use red wine and dish soap to the same effect. Gnats will be attracted to the scent of the wine and will get sucked down into the glass or bowl by the soap."

          "description":"Gnats love rotten fruit, so you can use this to your advantage to trap them. Simply mash up a banana, place it in a bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and poke little holes in the plastic with the tines of a fork. The gnats will enter through the holes to get to the banana but won\u2019t be able to get back out again. Because this method doesn\u2019t necessarily kill the gnats, make sure to dispose of the banana and the plastic wrap in the outdoor trash. You may even want to use a disposable bowl so you can just throw the entire trap away."

Repeat this process daily until you no longer notice any gnats.Warning: Wear a mask and protective gloves when you work with bleach. It also isn\u2019t a bad idea to wear old clothes, just in case you accidentally splash some on yourself."

Whenever you see gnats flying around, spray them with the mixture. This is a great non-toxic way to deal with gnats. It shouldn\u2019t harm any of your belongings, and it won\u2019t hurt your plants, pets, or kids."

Light the candle, close the curtains, and turn off all the lights. The gnats will be attracted to either the candle or the candle\u2019s reflection in the water. The candle itself will burn their wings, while the soapy water will trap them.Warning: Never leave a burning candle unattended, and don\u2019t place this trap near any loose fabric or somewhere it could easily get knocked over."

If you notice that fruit on the counter is starting to rot or attract bugs, throw it out or compost it.

At the least, make sure to clean the dishes and your sink at the end of each day to prevent dirty dishes from attracting gnats. Don\u2019t leave prepared food sitting out on the counter for longer than 30 minutes. Store food in reusable containers and put them into the fridge as soon as possible.

Similarly, if you have open trash cans outside, make sure they aren\u2019t located next to any windows. The gnats could be attracted to the trash and then find their way indoors through the window.Tip: Invest in a trash can with a lid that seals. An open trash can is an open invitation to gnats. But a trash can with a lid that firmly closes can keep gnats away from the food and waste inside."

Set it outside or in a garage or shed for a few days until the soil starts to dry out. If this doesn\u2019t work, you may want to repot your plants in fresh soil. On the flip side, there are a few plants that repel gnats. These can be potted and kept indoors, or you can plant then outside if you struggle with gnat infestations outdoors. Geraniums, lemon thyme, lavender, and marigolds are the best natural repellants."
