Add in another 500 mL (2 cups) water and stir until well mixed. Let stand a few minutes and stir again. For regular dry milk, use 175mL (\u00be cup) of the powder instead.

If you buy dry milk for shelf life reasons, use UHT (\"ultra high temperature\") milk, which can last unopened for six months at room temperature. If you buy dry milk to save money, use ordinary milk and mix in as much as your budget allows. UHT milk tastes slightly sweeter than regular milk, and not everyone likes the extra flavor."
