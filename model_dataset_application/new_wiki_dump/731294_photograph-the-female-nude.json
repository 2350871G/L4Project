          "description":"Your first task is to locate someone willing to be subject of a nude photoshoot. Get in touch with women in your area who are involved in photographic art and modeling. If you don't have any success on your own, you might be able to hire models through a professional agency. Make sure you\u2019re able to pay what they\u2019re asking before securing their services. Ask around at your local college campus. You\u2019ll probably have the most luck in the photography and traditional art departments. Be delicate with your recruitment tactics. Emphasize that it's an artistic endeavor. \"I'm producing a photographic tribute to the human form in its natural state\" sounds a lot better than \"would you be up for posing naked for the camera?\" Don\u2019t coerce conventional models into doing a nude shoot. Some models specialize in that type of thing; others don\u2019t. Find a subject that suits your project and aim as an artist."

          "headline":"Have an idea of what you want to accomplish.",
          "description":"Before you get too eager to start shooting, you should have a definite vision in mind and the means to realize it. Think about what types of thematic elements you might want to incorporate, as well as technical details such as possible angles and ideas for lighting and framing. The worst thing you can do is go into a nude photoshoot unprepared. Sketch out the poses and compositions you envision most vividly and have them handy on the day of the shoot. If possible, show your model a few visual references of the kind of images you hope to capture. There should be an unspoken trust between the photographer and their subject. The idea of taking her clothes off for an unprepared amateur may make your model uneasy."

          "headline":"Scout out a good location.",
          "description":"Keep an eye out for eye-catching places that might work well for a nude photoshoot. The visual intrigue of your location should do your model justice. Natural landscapes, such as fields, forests and bodies of water, are a popular choice because they complement the natural state of the unclothed body. However, you might also choose an industrial site, urban sprawl or some other area that\u2019s interesting to look at. Avoid public areas and places where you\u2019re likely to be spied on or interrupted. If you need a permit to take photographs in a particular location, make sure you have the details sorted out before you begin shooting."

          "headline":"Set up a time and place to meet.",
          "description":"Schedule a preliminary meetup with your model to discuss your ideas for the shoot. Buy her lunch, take her out for coffee or invite her to your studio space for a friendly chat. Take the opportunity to break the ice before getting right down to business. Once it\u2019s time to uncap the lens, you\u2019ll already be acquainted and comfortable with one another. Be sure to outline the particulars of your concept so she\u2019ll have an idea of what to expect. Feel free to ask for her input in return. Use this time to gauge your model's comfort level regarding your ideas for the shoot. Ask questions like \"would you be alright with...?\" and \"how would you feel about...?\" The initial meetup is not a date. Do your best to help her feel relaxed, but keep things professional and appropriate."

This might be a soft, diffuse sunset glow if you\u2019re shooting in a cornfield, or a more stark balance of light and shadows for high-contrast black and white photos. Your lighting should work in conjunction with your model\u2019s form and pose to produce the most aesthetically-pleasing images possible. When possible, rely on natural light sources, such as the sun, moon and firelight. It has a much warmer, more immediate feel than artificial light (such as studio lights and reflectors), especially for daytime shoots. Move your light sources around and try out different brightness levels, placements and orientations until you arrive at the look you want."

Be thoughtful in your approach and take the time to capture every nuance of your subject, location, lighting and action. Mix it up. Include a few black and white photos in a vibrantly colored set or find ways to incorporate other thematic elements into the shoot. See what you can do to enhance the look of your photos (without altering them too much) during the editing phase."

Though it\u2019s important to have a specific vision in mind, improvising a bit can help keep your shoot fresh and exciting. Sometimes the best ideas start as accidents when you\u2019re just playing around. You never know when you might achieve a breakthrough by simply letting things unfold on their own. Instead of running through the poses you decided on before the shoot, allow your model to move and position herself freely, and capture everything you can. You can always delete unusable shots later, but you might end up with one or two really special shots."

Use minimalistic accessories (like scarves or jewelry) to cover sensitive parts of the body, or shoot your model from unorthodox angles or interacting with their environment from a three-dimensional perspective. The point of nude photography isn\u2019t always to show the body in plain detail. Sometimes, less is more. In the end, your goal is to make a powerful statement. Don\u2019t restrain your creativity in finding unique ways to shoot the human body. Avoid graphic depictions of the genitals. This is leaving the domain of art and entering that of pornography."
