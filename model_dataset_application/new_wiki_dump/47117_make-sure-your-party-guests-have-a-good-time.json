Or you may decorate using a television show, movie, or book as a theme, such as Twin Peaks, The Goonies, or The Great Gatsby. Use a theme to decorate the space so it is fun and interesting for your guests. You can also encourage your guests to dress up to fit the theme when you send out invitations for the party.

Put on a top 40 song radio station or play artists in your catalogue that you feel are good for parties and hangouts. Play the music through speakers at a decent sound level so it can be heard, but does not drown out the conversation. Lean into the theme of the party when you make the playlist. For example, if the party is 80s themed, make sure you include all the 80s hits. You can also use a music streaming service like Spotify, Apple Music, or Tidal to make a music playlist. Many streaming services have premade playlists for parties that you can use."
