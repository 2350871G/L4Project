Put bagels you want to keep for any amount of time longer than that in the other group. This second group is going in the freezer. Fresh bagels can be safely kept in the pantry for up to about a week. However, after 2 to 3 days, they\u2019ll start to go a bit stale. Your best bet is to freeze bagels you\u2019re not sure you can eat within a 2-day timeframe. Store-bought bagels will usually keep for about 5 to 7 days in the pantry. They should be frozen if you won\u2019t eat them within the week."

If the bag doesn\u2019t have any holes, you can use it to store the bagels for the next week. Once you\u2019ve checked for damage to the bag, open it up, squeeze out the excess air, and then seal it again. If there\u2019s even a small tear, transfer the bagels to a resealable plastic bag. Be sure to remove the extra air before you seal it up. Generally, you can use the twist-tie the bag came with to reseal it. If the twist-tie doesn\u2019t work, you can knot the end of the bag to close it."

Check on the bagel after 5 minutes to see if it\u2019s toasted to your liking. If you prefer it a little crispier, keep it in the oven for an additional 5 minutes (or even longer). Look in on it every 5 minutes until you\u2019re satisfied. The water will resurrect your bagel once it hits the heated oven, making your favorite baked good nice and fresh rather than hard and stale. If you\u2019re worried that your bagel with slip through the cracks on your oven rack, you can put it on a cookie sheet. No need to grease it! You can also use a toaster, although the oven works best."
