Bottom rail will always be straight and larger than your stabilizer. Lay these out along the site. Slide the bottom rail into the bottom plate up to the dimple on the plate.

The block should be placed into the ground so that the track is still sitting flush on the ground. Be sure the block is level in all directions. Remove one bottom rail to bring in the sand. Mark the two connecting bottom plates so that you place it back in the correct spot after bringing in the sand. Dump the sand in your pool area.

Staggered wall bar systems don\u2019t come with pre-attached wall bars. Line up your parts and place one wall bar on the inside of the pool and one on the outside of the pool.
