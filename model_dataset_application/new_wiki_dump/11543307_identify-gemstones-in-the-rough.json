A streak plate is a square of unglazed porcelain that has a rough surface you can use to help identify the gemstone. Lie the plate flat on a workbench, table, or desk so it\u2019s stable.You can find streak plates at your local hobby store or online. The color of a gemstone\u2019s powder is often more reliable than the color that you see on the surface of the rock.Tip: If you don\u2019t have access to a streak plate, use an unglazed ceramic tile to test the streak."
