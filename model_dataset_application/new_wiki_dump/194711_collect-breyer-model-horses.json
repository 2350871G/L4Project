One way to build a satisfying collection is to choose one size of Breyer model and focus on that. Your horses will all look like they belong in the same place, and you'll still be able to choose from a wide variety of breeds and postures. Here are a few examples:\nTraditional models are the largest, and among the most popular. Mini Whinnies are the smallest, and therefore the cheapest. Classics, Paddock Pals, and Stablemates are additional popular types, but there are many more."
