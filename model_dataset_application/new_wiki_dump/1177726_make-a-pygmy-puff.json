A medium density is best because the pygmy puff is firm enough to stand on its own but is still plush and soft. You will wad up some yarn to start, then continue to wrap the yarn around to build it up. Make sure that the pygmy puff looks circular; wrap the yarn repeatedly over an area that bulges to make it look more normal."

Attach to the face with glue dots roughly the size of the googly eyes. If you don't have googly eyes, draw eyes on a piece of paper, then cut out and attach. Draw the iris first (the colored part), then the pupil (black), and add a dot with a silver sharpie to imitate light reflecting off the eye. Attach to the pygmy puff with glue dots."

          "description":"Pygmy puffs have long, skinny tongues that they use to scavenge for food. You can make your tongue as short as 3 inches or as long as 8 inches. Cut your desired length from either red or pink embroidery thread and make a large knot on one end. Thread the other end through a plastic needle. Push the needle through the center of the pygmy puff, making sure it comes out in a spot you like. Remove the needle from the thread and pull all of the embroidery thread through. If the tongue is too long, shorten it. To retract the tongue, pull the knot in the back. To lengthen the tongue, pull the thread in the front."

For a super fluffy, shaggy pygmy puff, choose a bulky fur-type yarn, which is often branded as Fun Fur. For a super soft, fuzzy but less shaggy version, pick a fluffy type of wool strips. If you\u2019re trying to make a pygmy puff just like from the books, then you should pick a shade of purple or pink, but realistically, you can make it whatever color you want."

Once the hot glue has dried and one end of the material is firmly attached, you can start winding the material around the foam ball. If you\u2019re using yarn, you can simply wind tightly. If you\u2019re using wool, you\u2019ll need to add dabs of hot glue to the underside and press them to the ball to get it to stick. Turn the ball as you wind, moving it with every loop around. Keep building up the material until you can no longer see the styrofoam peeking through the fur anywhere."

You\u2019ll use this to form the shape of the head for your pygmy puff. Shape the felt for the head. You\u2019ll need to use a bit of filling to give the head shape and make it retain the shape. Place something small and pliable, like a cotton ball, inside the piece of felt and wrap the felt around it. #* If you wish, you can also take something small\u2014such as cutting off the tip of a Q-tip\u2014and you can hot glue one end to the cotton ball and the opposite end to the inside surface of the felt. This will help hold the head shape in place, and it will also form a small little muzzle for the nose and mouth. Glue the head together. Once you\u2019re happy with the shape of the head, hot glue the felt together at the back of the head. You\u2019ll probably be able to trim some excess felt away before you finish gluing."

          "description":"In the movies, Ginny\u2019s pygmy puff has very beady black eyes, so you can simply use two small black dots of felt and hot glue them above the little nose muzzle you shaped in the face. If you want the eyes to have a shinier look than that, you can easily find two small black beads at the craft store while picking up the rest of the supplies. If you want to make it sillier looking, you can simply use googly eyes from the craft store."

If you were able to see the seam or any matting where you glued the end up the yarn or felt in place on the body, then make sure you attach the head over the seam. You may also want to brush the fur out of the way before you attach the head; otherwise you can accidentally end up with sticky hot glue clumping the fur together."
