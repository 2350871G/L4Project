  "text":" Making the Clay Snake and Base Choose two colours of clay, making sure they are almost the same or match really well.  Roll the base colour into a long snake around half a metre. Make sure it is about a centimeter and a half thick. Roll the second clay colour into tiny balls of clay, and carefully press them onto the snake. These will make the patterns of the snake. Take a third piece of a bit of red clay to make the snake's tongue. Use a clay cutter to make the tongue forked. Flatten one end of the body of the snake and roll one tiny black dot. Press it gently onto the flattened edge to make the eye. Press the red forked tongue onto the edge of the flattened end.  Make two thick clay pancakes out of the base colour of your snake. This will be the bottom of your pencil holder. Making the Pencil Holder Press the two thick pancake clay pieces together. Stick the stabilisers into an octagonal shape on the thick pancake. Make sure to leave two centimeters for the snake. Wrap your snake around the stabilisers. Start wrapping from the unflattened end. Be careful not to tear your snake apart as you wrap. Once you get to the flattened end, bend the snake's head upwards.  Bake the snake pencil holder until it's rock hard. Just make sure you don't burn yourself while checking. Remove from the oven. Allow to cool. When cooled, just stick your pens and pencils in and you have a snake pencil holder!",
