          "description":"Croton petra plants tend to grow upwards and can become top-heavy. Make sure you choose a sturdy, well balanced pot that can handle the weight of a croton petra, like clay or ceramic. Look for at least 1 drainage hole in the bottom of your pot to ensure that your plant can drain any moisture as it needs to. Most plants come in a plastic pot from the nursery or garden supply store. Plants should not be left in plastic pots for longer than a week after you take them home."

Gently pull the croton petra out of the plastic container and leave the roots intact. Place the plant in its new pot and add potting soil if there are gaps between the soil and the pot. Disturbing the roots can cause your plant to go into shock and become sick."

Use your plant as a landscaping item if the temperature is above 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). As soon as it gets colder, you must bring your croton petra inside, or it could die.Tip: If your climate gets really cold every winter, you should probably keep your plant indoors year round. Re-planting your croton petra each season can be damaging and may cause it to die. If you plant multiple croton Petras outdoors, keep them 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) away from each other in the ground."
