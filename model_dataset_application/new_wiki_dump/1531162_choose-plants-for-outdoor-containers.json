          "description":"Colorful faithfuls like zinnias, snapdragons, and marigolds make good candidates for 4-5 inch (10-13 cm) pots due to their minimal spatial requirements. Cosmos, coreopsis, and periwinkles are also good choices. These plants do well with moderate amounts of water and sunlight, which means they won\u2019t need to be moved often. Consult a regional gardening guide to find out which species of annuals are best suited for your climate. When planting multiple seedlings, space them evenly throughout the pot to allow plenty of room for their roots to spread out as they grow. Avoid clustering more than 2-3 seedlings into the same pot."

          "description":"Since these can get by on minimal water and sunlight, they\u2019re a practical option for those who are frequently away from home for long periods. Look into the spatial needs of the plants you're growing to make sure your containers are large enough to accommodate them. Lavender, hydrangea, dianthus, and Peruvian lilies are all popular perennials for container gardening. Most perennials do best in their own individual planters that provide at least 10 square inches (roughly 65 square cm) of space. You might also have success grouping two or more small perennials in the same container. Phlox Blue Flame, Veronica Purpleicious, and Lilly of the Valley all make good candidates for multi-plant containers."

          "description":"Elevated containers will make it possible for species like fuchsia, petunias, ivy, and sweet potato vine to stretch their tendrils without spilling out onto the ground. Their cascading foliage is also a good way to add a touch of greenery to porches and sunrooms with vaulted ceilings. Suspend your hanging containers high enough to keep trailing plants from overtaking nearby walking or sitting space. Since trailing plants can get so large, it's usually best to limit them to one per container."

          "description":"If your planters are looking a bit bare around the edges, a few tufts of Maiden Grass or foxtrot may be just what you need to frame your more extravagant display flowers. The sleek, spiky stalks of blue fescue or liriope can also create an appealing bed for towering plants like dracaena or adenium to rise from. Sow filler grasses at least 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) from your flowering plants to prevent their root structures from crowding one another out. Before you begin mixing and matching ornamental grasses with other plants, read up on both species to ensure that they\u2019re equipped to survive in the same basic environmental conditions."

For a more nuanced expression of a single palette, try blending flowering plants with shades that are similar but not exact, like snapdragons and sedum sieboldii. You might also use to the color of your plants to enhance or offset your surroundings. A spray of cherry-pink zinnias, for instance, will practically glow within a sea of soft green shrubs. Don't be afraid to take chances. You have to be willing to experiment a little in order to discover combinations that are exciting, unexpected, and unique to your garden."

          "description":"Contrary to popular belief, you don\u2019t need acres of open space to grow fresh fruit. In fact, all you really need is a simple planter roughly 1 foot (0.30 m) wide by 1 foot (0.30 m) deep. As long as you're using a dwarf variety, you can grow apples, peaches, plums, or any number of other juicy, delicious offerings in a pot. A 10\u201315 gallons (38\u201357 l) plastic planter is ideal for fruit trees of average size. One of these planters will be roomy enough for the spreading root system, but still small enough to pick up and move without difficulty. As your fruit trees continue to grow, they can be moved to larger containers or even planted below ground. You'll know when they're ready to be transplanted when the roots begin to poke through the drainage holes or upper layer of soil."

It\u2019s also easier to patrol a close grouping of planters for scavenging critters. You may have to get creative when looking for containers big enough to hold your miniature vegetable garden. In addition to premade planters, for instance, you could also use a halved wooden barrel, metal washtub, or row of milk crates.

Try filling a set of mason jars or ceramic flower pots with a small amount of potting soil mix and adding rosemary, sage, thyme, or cilantro to each. Lush, leafy herbs like mint and basil may require something a little deeper, such as a festive serving bowl. In addition to the standard pots, jars, and cups, a few more inventive containers for housing your herbs include ornate china teacups, baby food jars, metal kitchen canisters, and recycled glass bottles. Giving your herbs their own place to grow frees up valuable planter space and makes it easier to keep tabs on their progress."

This gives winding root systems the ability to spread out and creates a more hospitable environment for outdoor plants of all types. Look for potting soil mixtures containing ingredients like aged bark, vermiculite, lime, and peat moss. These substances are essential for promoting healthy growth.

          "description":"Outdoor plants often lose moisture faster due to fluctuations in temperature and exposure to direct sunlight. Different species have different moisture requirements, but generally speaking, plants in large containers should be watered thoroughly once a day, while those in smaller containers need a drink once in the morning and again in the evening. Your waterings will need to become more frequent during the hot summer months. Plants in small, porous containers tend to dry out rapidly. Using a water retaining potting mix or switching to a container with fewer drainage holes may help keep them moist longer. Avoid overwatering your potted plants. Enclosed containers cause soil to drain slower, and if you\u2019re not careful, the excess moisture could rot or drown out the roots. Plants that have been overwatered may appear lifeless or rubbery, while dry soil and discolored leaves are the most common symptoms of underwatered plants."

Those that prefer shade, such as peace lilies, philodendron, and most ferns, can be arranged along one wall of your home so they receive less direct exposure. You may be better off growing temperamental species like Bluebells and African Iris in lightweight containers that can be repositioned easily throughout the day as light and temperature conditions change. Save heavy, stationary planters for perennials, small trees, and other hearty plants that will be okay in one spot."

Leaves with small holes or jagged edges may have recently been food for hidden insects. Likewise, significant browning and withering could be symptoms of disease in plants that are currently in season. You can thin the ranks of most common plant pests by spraying them a mild soapy water solution, or simply removing them by hand. Minor plant diseases can usually be treated with careful pruning and restoring water, sunlight, and key soil nutrients to their optimal levels."
