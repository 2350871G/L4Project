Have an AoE ranged DPS\u2014One or two Wizards is good. If only 1 Wizard is available, you can add 1 Grenadier or 1 Ravager.

Since Infernal Abyss is filled with monsters that inflicts fire, equipping a fire element will halve the additional damage to low. Tanks should also consider wearing the HP orange gear for both top and bottom as their roles are mainly supportive. DPS should consider wearing defensive gear for the top set and offensive gear for the bottom. Use full-damage sets during the first couple of floors to quicken the pace and then switch them to defense at a later time to avoid one-shot kills. EVA equipments are found useless in this dungeon since Zaahir is reincarnated every 5 floors, which can make him much higher level than you. So no matter how much your EVA is, the boss still lands hits on you."

Secret Stones is one of the best way to deal additional damage. It will give you 6% crit damage + damage % toward flame monsters. If you have a Beirut Card, a boss card obtained from the Beirut bunny boss in Other world: Port Skandia, this lets you deal an additional 18% damage toward flame monsters.
