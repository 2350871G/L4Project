          "description":"Stand over the sink and place the zucchini under warm, running water. Use a vegetable brush to gently scrub the surface of the zucchini to remove any dirt. Continue rinsing the zucchini until the water runs clear and its skin looks clean. Pat the surface of the zucchini dry so that you won't have a wet, slippery vegetable when you begin chopping. You can use a mild vegetable soap or hand soap to wash the zucchini if it is especially dirty. Make sure to only use a small amount of soap and rinse the vegetable thoroughly to remove it completely before boiling. Use a dish-washing brush in case you don't have a vegetable brush handy."

          "description":"Place the zucchini on a cutting board, holding it firmly with one hand. Use the chef's knife to slice off each end of the zucchini about half an inch from the tip to remove the remnants of the stem and flower. Make sure to handle the knife with care as it will be very sharp and could easily cut you. Never chop with the blade facing in the direction of your fingers. These pieces are tough and unpleasant to eat. You can either compost or dispose of the zucchini ends in the trash can."

          "description":"Cut the zucchini into two pieces lengthwise using your chef's knife. Place the two halves of the zucchini onto the cutting board with the flat sides facing down. This will ensure that it won't roll while you are chopping. Cut each zucchini in half lengthwise again, then slice it in the opposite direction, perpendicular to the length-wise cuts, to create small cubes. Make sure to use a sharp knife in order to easily make smooth cuts. Depending on the size of your cutting board, you may need to place a bowl nearby so that you can transfer the cubes to it as your cutting board begins to fill up. Make sure to keep a clear workspace as you cut in order to avoid cutting accidents."

          "description":"Fill a large pot with unsalted, warm water. Place the pot on the stove and adjust the heat to the medium-high setting. Place a lid on the pot to encourage it to boil more quickly. Make sure the pot is large enough to accommodate the amount of zucchini you plan to blanch. The zucchini should be able to be completely submerged in the water without being overcrowded. This could cause the zucchini to cook unevenly."

          "description":"Remove the lid of your pot once the water has reached a rolling boil and gently add the zucchini to the pot. Consider transferring the zucchini from your cutting board to the pot with a slotted spoon to minimize splashing. If you have a wire basket that fits inside your pot, lower your zucchini into the water using the basket. The wire basket will help avoid splashing and make it easier to remove the zucchini from the water once it has finished blanching. Be very careful when transferring the zucchini to your pot. The boiling water can burn your skin, so consider wearing oven mitts for added protection."

          "description":"Adjust the temperature of your stove in order to maintain a rolling boil for several minutes. Stir the zucchini gently once or twice during the 3 to 4 minutes to make sure it is cooking evenly. Be careful not to overcook the zucchini. Test the zucchini with a fork to test its texture. The zucchini should still be firm when you remove it from the water. The size of your zucchini cubes will determine how long you should keep them in the boiling water. If you chop the zucchini into cubes larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm)  square, you will need to increase the cooking time by around a minute."

          "description":"Fill a large bowl with ice and water and place it on the counter near your stove. Once the zucchini has finished boiling, carefully transfer the zucchini cubes from the boiling water to the ice water with a slotted spoon. Allow the zucchini to cool in the water for 1 to 2 minutes. Cooling the zucchini cubes in the ice water bath is important for ending the cooking process abruptly. Overcooking the zucchini during the blanching process could accidentally remove the nutrients from the vegetable. The zucchini will feel cool to the touch once the cooking process has been suspended. If the zucchini is not cooling quickly enough, consider adding additional ice to the bowl."

If the ice hasn't completely melted, you may need to pick out any remaining ice left behind in the colander from the zucchini by hand."

You'll need to remove any residual water before you cook or store your freshly blanched zucchini cubes. Once your paper towel becomes saturated with water, switch to a fresh one in order to dry the zucchini more efficiently. You can also use a kitchen towel for a reusable, environmentally friendly drying method. Make sure to dry the zucchini very gently so that you do not damage its structure."
