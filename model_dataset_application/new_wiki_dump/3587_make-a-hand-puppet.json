          "description":"The most basic requirement for your sock puppet is a clean sock. If you want to make a specific character, keep the color of the sock in mind. Remember that a black sock will be harder to draw on. Understand that you\u2019ll need to attach materials to make the face rather than draw it on"

          "description":"Slip your sock on your hand, and use your thumb as the lower jaw and your fingers to form the face and upper jaw. This will help you block out on the sock the space for the eyes, nose, hair, etc."

          "headline":"Make the eyes for the puppet.",
          "description":"You can use a variety of objects to make the eyes for your sock puppet. Try using googly eyes. You can find these at craft stores or in the craft section of big box stores. You could also draw the eyes on a piece of construction paper. Using overlapping circles of felt for the whites, color, and pupils of the eyes is an option. Try using beads as eyes. You can find plenty of beads in a wide variety at a craft store. If you need to take the sock off your hand to make the eyes, then mark the position for the eyes with a small pen mark, so you can see the rough size you want to make the eyes."

          "headline":"Attach the eyes.",
          "description":"Depending on what you decided to use for the eyes, you may have to attach them in separate ways. For quick and easy results, you can simply use a glue stick, but a hot glue gun will yield better results. For beads and felt, you can also consider sewing the eyes to the sock. If you use a hot glue gun, make sure to take the sock off your hand first so as not to burn yourself."

          "headline":"Make the mouth for your puppet.",
          "description":"You can make the mouth for your sock puppet as simple or complex as you'd like. For a simple mouth, try using crayons or a fabric marker to draw lips. Put your hand in the sock puppet and figure out where the mouth would be given the dimensions of your hand. Draw the lips around where your fingertips form the lips of the sock puppet. You could also make a more complex mouth. You can consider making a tongue out of construction paper or felt , making teeth with beads, or drawing a more elaborate mouth."

          "description":"You have even more options for the nose of your puppet than some of the other features. You can use felt, a pompom, crayons, markers, or even leave your puppet without a nose. For many puppets, simply drawing in nostrils with a black or color marker is more than enough for a nose."

          "headline":"Make your template.",
          "description":"There are a couple ways to get a template for your hand puppet. You can buy them at crafts stores, download them online, or make them yourself. If you want to make a basic hand puppet yourself, put your hand palm down on your piece of fabric. Now draw small dots on the fabric on either side of your hand to designate the width. This is how wide you\u2019ll want the body of your template to be. Once you\u2019ve done that, you can start drawing the outline of your puppet. If you want your puppet to have arms remember that your thumb and pinky will be controlling the arms. Put your hand back down on the fabric and designate where your thumb and pinky emerge from your hand. This is where you\u2019ll want the arms to begin. Make sure you leave room for your fingers in the head of the puppet as well. Your index, middle, and ring finger will need to rest in there, so ensure that it is wide enough for those three fingers to fit inside. Otherwise, the drawing is up to you! Using the width of your hand as your guide make two straight parallel lines. Now round these lines off away from each other diagonally to create the arms. Try to keep them the same length. Keep in mind that they should be pretty short. Once you\u2019ve completed the full outline of the arms draw a wide half circle for the head. Add ears, horns, or whatever else you would like to the outline."

Once you start cutting make sure that you don't move the two pieces of fabric away from each other at all.
