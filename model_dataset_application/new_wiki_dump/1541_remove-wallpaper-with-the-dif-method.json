Specialized tools are available at your local hardware store. Look for tools which have spur-like wheels on them. These tools will perforate the wall with thousands of little dots, so that the DIF can soak in. Make sure you do a thorough job of perforating the wall. You'll notice that areas with less perforation are harder to remove."
