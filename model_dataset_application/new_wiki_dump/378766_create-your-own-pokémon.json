          "description":"Most Pok\u00e9mon are based on an animal or object that already exists in the real world. To start your design, pick an animal that you find fascinating or an object that you think would make a good foundation for your creation. Stick with simple choices for your first design to keep things simple. This could be a rat, seal, or chicken if you\u2019re picking an animal. If you\u2019re selecting an object, an ice cube, tree, or carpet could all work as good bases. For example, you could start with a fox as the foundation for a Pok\u00e9mon based on an animal. A thumbtack might make for an interesting object for a Pok\u00e9mon. Animal designs from the game are all over the place. Sandshrew is based on an armadillo, Rattata is based on a rat, and Ekans is clearly a snake. Examples based on objects include Geodude, who is a rock, and Magnemite, who is a screw with 2 magnets on it. The vast majority of Pok\u00e9mon are based on animals. There are far fewer Pok\u00e9mon that are based on objects, and it\u2019ll probably be easier for you to start with an animal."

          "description":"Every Pok\u00e9mon needs an element to determine its type. The element determines a Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s moves, strengths, weaknesses, and usually its color. Pok\u00e9mon can only have 1-2 types, and these types do not have to be related to the object or animal that the Pok\u00e9mon is based on\u2014although it\u2019s perfectly fine if they are related. For example, a Pok\u00e9mon based on a chicken can be a fire type, even though chickens have nothing to do with fire. Element Colors:\nFire \u2013 Orange, red, and yellow\nWater \u2013 Blue and white\nGrass \u2013 Green, brown, and yellow\nElectric \u2013 Yellow (typically bright yellow)\nPsychic \u2013 The symbol is magenta, but psychic Pok\u00e9mon tend to be a variety of colors\nSteel \u2013 Silver, gold, and white\nNormal \u2013 Brown, pink, and white\nFairy \u2013 Pink and purple\nDark \u2013 Black, white, and dark blue\nFlying \u2013 The symbol is purple, but flying Pok\u00e9mon can be any color\nGhost \u2013 Purple, black, and magenta\nPoison \u2013 Purple, dark yellow, and dark red\nIce \u2013 White, silver, and light blue\nGround \u2013 Earth tones, like brown, yellow, and grey\nRock \u2013 Black, grey, and white\nDragon \u2013 The symbol is royal blue, but any color scheme works (they\u2019re usually a 3-4 colors)\nFighting \u2013 The symbol is red, but fighting Pok\u00e9mon can be any color\nBug \u2013 Green, yellow, and brown\n\n\nFor example, if you make a fox Pok\u00e9mon a poison type, its fur could be purple and its eyes could be yellow. You could make a thumbtack Pok\u00e9mon a flying and steel type and give it wings and a sleek silver color. Using the corresponding colors lets people automatically know something about your Pok\u00e9mon just by looking at it. If a hedgehog Pok\u00e9mon is bright yellow, the viewer can automatically assume that it\u2019s an electric type."

Your Pok\u00e9mon can be smiling, smirking, frowning, or have no mouth at all! Choose a face style to give your Pok\u00e9mon the personality and attitude that you want it to have. For example, if you wanted to make a fox Pok\u00e9mon look intimidating and scary, you\u2019d give it sharp eyes angled down towards its snout. If you wanted to make the thumbtack look whimsical or silly, you could draw 2 round eyes with small pupils and give it a goofy smile. Look at other Pok\u00e9mon to see how the faces vary. Pikachu has wide set eyes and a simple, round smile. This makes it look funny and cute. Tangela only has two simple eyes with pupils in the center, making it look simple and mysterious."

These features could be wings, a halo, an extra set of arms, or some sort of pattern or symbol. For example, Pikachu is a rat, but it has a jagged, angular tail and 2 red dots on its cheek. Squirtle is a turtle, but it has a fluffy tail that turtles don\u2019t normally have. Choose interesting characteristics, or stick with features that fit your vision for the Pok\u00e9mon. You could also have your Pok\u00e9mon hold something. Cubone carries a little bone, while Farfetch\u2019d walks around with a leek. For example, you could give the poison fox a red streak on the side of its fur and give it a second set of ears. Your thumbtack Pok\u00e9mon could have a strange symbol in its forehead and have a set of tiny arms. The features often express the type of Pok\u00e9mon that it is.

For example, Pikachu is the base Pok\u00e9mon, but when it evolves, it turns into Raichu. It goes from being yellow to orange, and its thick tail turns into a thinner, pointer version.

Keep in mind, you can only use your fake Pok\u00e9mon card in casual games. You cannot use a custom card at a games shop or in a tournament. If you aren\u2019t playing with a friend, let your opponent know ahead of time that you have a custom card in your deck. Create evolutions if you want to fully flesh your Pok\u00e9mon out. When a Pok\u00e9mon reaches a certain level, it evolves and becomes a stronger version of itself. Evolved versions are typically larger and slightly different than their original form. Make 2-3 evolutions for your Pok\u00e9mon by repeating this entire process 2-3 times if you\u2019re really trying to make an authentic Pok\u00e9mon!Tip: Changing your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s characteristics for an evolution can be as simple as changing its color. You could also choose to give your Pok\u00e9mon additional limbs, a new facial feature, or extra patterns in its body. For example, Pikachu is the base Pok\u00e9mon, but when it evolves, it turns into Raichu. It goes from being yellow to orange, and its thick tail turns into a thinner, pointer version. Evolved versions are always stronger than the original form of a Pok\u00e9mon. Finished. ",
