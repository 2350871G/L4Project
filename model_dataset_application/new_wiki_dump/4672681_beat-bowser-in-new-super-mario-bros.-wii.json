Since he only throws one way (he throws them at the entrance), you just need to get closer to Bowser and you'll be fine. When Bowser jumps, it's your chance! Go behind Bowser and press the button! Bowser will make a scene starting to groan, then the bridge will collapse. After that happens, Princess Peach's cage is suddenly pulled off screen. Mario starts automatically trying to jump after her, until he sees that there are moving platforms."
