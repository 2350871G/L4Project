Depression glass often has bubbles, imperfections, and marks because it was made using an inexpensive process and cheap materials. In addition, some of the molds that were used to make Depression glass were uneven or ill-fitting, resulting in pieces with dents, irregular areas, and other imperfections. These flaws add to the charm of Depression glass. Just be sure to avoid pieces with signs of extreme wear and tear, such as large chips, nicks and cracks."
