Prepare a proposal for your boss that lists benefits of your remote work to your company. For example, you could mention that you\u2019ll be able to start work earlier in the day, since you won\u2019t need to commute. You could also say that you\u2019ll be able to increase your productivity, since you\u2019ll be happier and less worried about your environmental impact."
