If it doesn't, the yeast may be too old so a fresh sachet should be added to fresh water and sugar. Once the yeast is active, mix with the flour and salt and knead heavily (no need to be gentle) for 5\u201310 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and when the dough is pulled, it is smooth and elastic. Allow to prove at least one hour in a warm place. Once doubled or tripled in size, deflate the dough; punching or flattening it and then kneading again for a few more minutes to distribute the yeast. If using a mixing machine, follow the same method. A food processor work fine, but ideally mix the dough by hand and then process in batches so as not to overfill and overload the processor. If the dough is too wet, add a little more flour. Flour absorbency varies according to variety and time of year."

Using your palms, start at the middle and roll the dough outwards. The bread should end up a little fatter in the middle and thinner at the ends. The seams should be well sealed, otherwise pinch them shut again. The loaf should be about 40-50cm or so long, ideally longer if your oven may permit its size. In practice, do not roll out a loaf bigger than you can bake. Proof the dough until doubled in size. Use a floured linen or cotton tea towel, or use a baguette mould.

Further decoration is usually unnecessary as the wicker cane and flour leaves a pattern in the dough, but you may add some slashes with a razor to add extra details. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until cooked.  Making Croissant Shaped Rolls Roll the dough out into a large sheet. It should ideally be at least 20cm / 8 inches wide and 1 cm thick and however long the dough is. You may do this in half batches. Cut the edges to ensure the rectangle is neat. Cut the dough into triangle strips at least 10 cm, or 4 inches wide, making pizza like slices. Form the rolls. Roll the slices from the wide end to the narrow and bend gently into a crescent. Bake for 10-15 minutes. The rolls should be golden and hollow when tapped. Tricks with Stencils Prepare your loaf or rolls from the above methods. Stencils can be very easy to make from ordinary household objects to personalise your loaf. Mist the dough with water and then the stencil can be applied or held above the bread. Flour or other toppings (such as seeds, spices etc) may be sifted or sprinkled through it to leave a pattern or a silhouette. For example:\nA baking rack has slots and bars, where cake cooling racks can be diamonds, squares or a spiral. When the rack just gently touches the bread and flour is sifted over, it will leave the pattern in flour on the bread when the stencil is removed. You may also cut one out of baking paper to make a letter or shape. You may use cutlery like a wooden spoon to leave a silhouette, or even your hand. Apply your stencil after the bread has proofed. If you add it before, it may end up warped or at best unexpected patterns will arise. Bake the bread as per your recipe. ",
