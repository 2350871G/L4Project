Continue steaming until the wrinkles disappear. Depending upon the length of the fabric, the steamer will complete its task in 15 to 20 minutes. Spritzing the backdrop Hang the backdrop up. Clamp it tight to stretch it. Using a simple spray bottle filled with water, spritz the backdrop lightly from both sides.  As the backdrop dries, it will stretch and tighten, and the wrinkles will drop out.  Washing a stained backdrop Wash and dry the backdrops. Use a washing machine on a cool setting so that the backdrops do not tear away. Dry. For drying the backdrops, do not put it in the washing machine dryer. Hang it up and let it dry in a natural way. Do not over-dry the cloth, as this may result in shiny spots appearing on the cloth. Storing the backdrop Roll up all backdrops after use. After the shooting is over, roll up the backdrops on a plastic tube. Do not fold the backdrops. Folding the backdrops for a longer time will result in wrinkles. If you have more than one backdrop, buy extra support poles to store them on. Or to save money, buy rigid PVC plumbing pipe (about $10 for a 10-ft section) and roll the backdrop up tightly and carefully. Be careful not to introduce new wrinkles when you roll it. Secure the rolled up backdrop with masking tape, Velcro strips or with long shoelaces.  Store horizontally in a dry, clean location. Or, install shelf brackets on the wall to keep them.",
