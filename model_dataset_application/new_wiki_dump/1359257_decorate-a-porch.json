Deck chairs and benches with removable cushions work well here. If your porch is wide enough, consider installing a porch swing by attaching it to beams overhead. Good materials for porch furniture include teak wood, wicker, metal, and plastic. Any cushions should be mold/mildew resistant and waterproof. Acrylic and vinyl fabrics work best."

They will only provide a minor to moderate amount of light, but it is better than being in complete darkness. You can also install tiki torches around the edges of your porch for a fun and unique vibe. The advantage to using torches is that you can use bug repellent fuel to discourage undesired bugs from bothering you and your guests. Another option is to make a tabletop fire bowl and set it on your porch table. This may not provide quite as much light as garden lights or torches would, but you could use it in addition to these features to give a nice glow to your seating area."
