          "description":"These terms will help you understand the descriptions written on wine labels or in online wine reviews. When talking about wine, these words have the following meanings:\nSweetness: or a wine\u2019s \u201cdryness.\u201d Sweet wine is high in sugar content, which will cause tingling in the tip of your tongue. Cheap wines and many Cabernet Sauvignons are often dry. Acidity: \u201ctartness\u201d or \u201czestiness.\u201d Acidic wines feel lightweight and will leave your mouth wet, like you\u2019ve just bitten an apple. Tannic: bitter, much like black tea. It will cause your mouth to feel dry, but don\u2019t confuse this sensation with the dryness associated with a wine\u2019s sweetness."

          "headline":"Recognize fruit flavors and body.",
          "description":"Many wines feature a fruit flavor, like raspberry, blackberry, and blueberry. Full bodied wine describes wine that is heavy on your palette, whereas light bodied wine is not. The taste of a heavy vintage will linger in your mouth much longer than a light one. Some fruity wines include California Zinfandels, Argentinian Malbecs and Cabernet Sauvignons, and Merlots, especially those from Bordeaux. Generally, you can expect Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec from Cahors, some Syrah, and some Zinfandel wines to be heavier bodied. Lighter bodied wines oftentimes include Cabernet Sauvignon wines from Argentina, Pinot Noir wines, Cabernet Franc, and Tempranillo."

        {
          "headline":"Choose wine according to the key features of a main dish.",
          "description":"Sauce, seasoning, and cooking method are the three main factors that will influence the taste of the main dish. A red wine that has a similar earthiness, spiciness, or suppleness as the main dish will naturally pair well. Try steak in a teriyaki sauce with a Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Zinfandel, or red Bordeaux. Steak with a mustard sauce might go nicely with Syrah or Chianti wines. For example, if chicken marsala were part of the main spread, the dark, rich, earthy sauce would suit a soft bodied, supple red, like a high-end Zinfandel from California or a Cabernet Sauvignon from Argentina."

          "headline":"Round out key features of food with wine.",
          "description":"A dry, acidic red, like a Chianti, Montepulciano, or Sangiovese, will cut the fat of red meat dishes, allowing you to enjoy the flavor more. The strong flavors of grilled dishes often go well with Cabernet Sauvignon wines. Sweet flavors can be balanced with spicier reds, like many Cabernet Franc, Grenache, Malbec, and Shiraz wines."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Opt for Merlot for a versatile choice.",
          "description":"Merlot wines are usually soft and easy to drink. You can expect to find black cherry, plum, and herbal flavors in many Merlots. These wines will be less tannic (bitter) than other choices. Merlots pair well with virtually any menu. Many highly regarded Merlots are produced in Italy, California, Washington, Chile, and Australia. Medium price range bottles make a great gift."

          "description":"Cabernet wines will be one of the safest options for pairing with steak. The robust character will cut through fat, resulting in a smoother taste in the wine and richer flavor in the meat. If you ordered a mild-flavored steak (like one that is only lightly seasoned), Cabernet wines may be a little overpowering. Choose a milder wine in these instances, like a Pinot Noir or Merlot. If you\u2019re looking for something different from the usual Cabernet, try a Cabernet blend instead. In some cases, the terms \u201cBordeaux blend\u201d and \u201cCabernet blend\u201d may be used interchangeably."

Generally, wines with softer flavor profiles will best bring out the qualities of filet mignon, like a truffle flavored Pinot Noir from Oregon."

Rib eye with a neutral flavor is better suited for subtler vintages, like a California Cabernet or Syrah. If you want to take a risk with a bold red, do so when eating rib eye. The strong flavor and high marbling in this cut suits full-bodied, intense flavor profiles."

Northern Rhone reds and Syrah-based vintages are both excellent partners for porterhouse cuts. Because porterhouse steaks include two different cuts, pairing can be tricky.

These wines often have a more acidic flavor, which is perfect for rich and buttery sauces. Additionally, the savory notes of Bordeaux wine tend to go well with herb rubs and seasonings. Some common herbs used in grilled steak include rosemary, thyme, sage, basil, bay leaf, and more. Many special herb blends intended for grilled steak can be bought at your local grocery store or general retailers."

California Zinfandels usually have berry notes, which can also be a refreshing counterpoint to dry chile sauces, like mole. Zinfandels are considered to be a versatile, food-friendly wine. They can even be used as a marinade for cuts of steak that are a little tougher than usual."

          "description":"A dry riesling will usually have a moderate alcohol level (like 11% ABV or higher). The fruitiness and acidity of this wine make it an excellent match for any cut of steak you purchase. Some regions specialize in dry Rieslings. Try ones from Alsace (France), South Australia, Washington (US), New York (US), British Columbia (Canada), and Germany."
