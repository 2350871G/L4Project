They are also freely available if you have deciduous trees in your backyard.

          "description":"If you are making a pathway in your garden and want to prevent weed growth, you can try wood chips or shredded wood. These mulch types will do a pretty good job stopping weeds and are quite cheap or even freely available. They decompose more slowly than other types of organic mulch, so you don\u2019t need to replace the mulch as frequently. The downside is that they may compact the soil, since they are a little heavier. Bark and wood chips are typically low in nitrogen, which can result in a nitrogen deficiency in your garden. As a result, you may have to add more fertilizer to your garden, which could be costly. Bark tends to be low in nutrients and high in toxins, so it is not a great choice for improving soil quality. Wood chips are somewhat superior to bark in terms of improving soil quality."

This type of mulch will add a nice earthy red, brown or other color to your garden, as well as a nice, soft texture.
