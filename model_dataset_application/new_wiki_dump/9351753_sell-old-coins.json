These pieces of information will be somewhere on the coin. You can then type them into an online search engine to figure out what coin you have. Coin dealers and collectors may be able to help you, too. Take a clear photo of both sides of the coin and send it to coin collector groups online when you can\u2019t bring the coin in person."

The worse the damage is, the less value you\u2019ll get for your coin. Also look for any printing errors, since these often increase the value. Coins are graded on a 70-point scale where 0 is \u201cPoor\u201d and 70 is \u201cMint Condition.\u201d Coins rated \u201cGood\u201d or 6 are actually very worn, and ones rated \u201cFine\u201d or 12-15 have a medium amount of wear. Don\u2019t attempt to clean the coin! Coins are historical artifacts and collectors like them natural. Cleaning can actually damage the coin further."

Search your local phone directory or online to find a trustworthy coin appraiser or dealer. They\u2019ll analyze each coin, verify its authenticity, and tell you how much it\u2019s worth. Look at online reviews from other customers or consult the Better Business Bureau to vet the appraiser\u2019s reputation.

Make groups of high, medium, and low-value coins. How you group the coins is up to you, but the easiest way to do this is by wholesale value. You can also separate the coins based on how worn they are, the metal used in them, or where they were printed."

When you go to a dealer, look at their stock. If they have a lot of coins made of the same metal and of similar quality to the ones you\u2019re selling, chances are they\u2019ll give you a fairer price. Many dealers can also handle rare coins, but you\u2019ll usually get more money from auctions or private collectors when selling these coins. Remember that dealers are running a business. To make a profit, they\u2019ll pay you less than the wholesale price. It\u2019s best to let multiple dealers evaluate your coins. Stay polite as you continue to shop around."

Try to find an auction that features a lot of coins of similar material to yours, such as copper or silver. Auctions are unpredictable, so you may earn less than what a dealer would pay or you may get an unexpected boost to your sale price. Auctions charge both a buyer and seller fee of around 10-15% of the final sale price. Account for this when determining how much you can make from auctioning a coin.
