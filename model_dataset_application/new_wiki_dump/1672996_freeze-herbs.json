Note that not everyone agrees that herbs can be frozen at all. Some chefs believe it ruins the herbs and should be avoided. On the other hand, others believe it is just fine to freeze herbs. It is recommended that you try it for yourself as an experiment to see whether or not the results work for you. Herbs thought to be amenable to freezing include: chives, chervil, dill, fennel leaves, parsley and tarragon. Herbs that don't dry well are better frozen (for example, chives, basil, chervil, cilantro and dill. Keep in mind that some herbs may be better dried than frozen. For example, rosemary will dry really simply without much ado and retains its flavor for a long time."

However, the need to pick them before the sun has heated them may depend on where you live; if your sunshine isn't too fierce, any time of the day may be appropriate. The reason to avoid picking herbs that are damp is that they can mildew easily. For the purposes of freezing, it's just more water you need to get rid of."

If you have washed the herbs, leave on absorbent paper to soak up moisture, then pat dry."

Herbs should be free of dirt, insects and any other plant matter. If needed, wash dirty herbs gently but thoroughly and allow to dry completely before freezing. If you know the herbs are from a clean source and can get away with just brushing them or wiping them, this is preferable to washing them too much. If you have washed the herbs, leave on absorbent paper to soak up moisture, then pat dry. Select a method for freezing based on one of the following. Aim to use frozen herbs within two months, to avoid loss of flavor. Herbs kept frozen any longer than this may taste bland or even unpleasant, depending on the type of herb. Choosing Whole Sprigs, Stems or Large Leaves Select herbs that can be turned into sprigs. Some herbs will stay in sprigs, such as rosemary, parsley or thyme. Bay leaves can be frozen this way. Line a baking sheet or tray with parchment paper or kitchen foil.  Lay the sprigs across the baking sheet or tray. Place in the freezer and allow to freeze. Remove from the freezer. Place into bags or suitable freezer containers. Note the date and contents before returning to the freezer. Use within two months. Grating or Chopping the Herbs Grate or finely chop the herbs before freezing. This will take care of the mush many softer leaf herbs are going to turn into anyway. You can grate or finely chop single herbs this way or do a mixture of complementary herbs. Place into small freezer bags. Date and label the bags. Freeze. Use within two months. Freezing in Ice Cube Trays Wash and completely dry an ice cube tray. If freezing lots, use more trays. Chop or dice the herbs up finely. Sprinkle to about 1/4 of the way in each ice cube hole in the tray. This can work for mixed herb combinations as well as single herb varieties. Cover each herb lot with a little water. Don't overfill the cubes or herbs will float away. Note: Some people find it easier to pour in a little water, then add the herbs, then pour in the remaining bit of water. Experiment to see what you prefer. Freeze the cubes. Once frozen, transfer to resealable freezer bags or freezer containers and label  and date as appropriate. Place back in the freezer. Leave until needed. Use within two months. To use, simply add one or two cubes to a dish you're cooking at any one time. To help you measure, one ice cube of herbs is worth approximately 15ml/1 tablespoon of chopped herbs. Freezing in Butter Make an herb butter. There are plenty of possibilities, including thyme butter, basil butter, rosemary butter and herb butter. Wrap the butter in kitchen foil. Place this inside a freezer-proof container with a lid. Label and date the container. You can freeze little portions (easiest to thaw), a butter roll or a whole block of herb butter. Do whichever works best for your cooking and storage needs. Use. Herb butter will keep for up to 12 months. You can either slice off a piece of the frozen butter and allow just that piece to thaw, or thaw the whole portion, depending on your needs. Thaw in the refrigerator and once it has thawed, keep it covered in the refrigerator and use within 2 to 3 days. Freezing in Oil (Herb and Oil Paste) Use the ice cube method above. However, this time, use a food processor to puree soft leaved herbs (such as basil, parsley or cilantro) with a little olive oil or a more mildly flavored vegetable oil of choice. The herbs must be completely dry before processing. The ratio is about 1 cup fresh herbs to 1/4 cup oil. Process until a smooth paste is formed.  Add the olive oil pureed herb to the ice cubes. Fill about 3/4 of the way. Do not add water. Place in the freezer to freeze. Remove when frozen and add to freezer bags. Label and date. Use a cube or two when needed. Use within 3 months.",
