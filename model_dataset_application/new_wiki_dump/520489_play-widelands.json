By clicking any wares, you display the amount of them produced over time and their average production rate in the chart. You determine the period of time taken into account for this by clicking the buttons below; you may choose between the last 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 8 hours) or\n\nSee Buildings Statistics (opens a list of all available buildings and shows, how many units of ware they have produced respectively, how many of them have been built and how many are yet being built. Clicking a building shows the average productivity for that kind of building and allows you to jump either from one finished building of that type to another, from one unfinished building of that type to another or from one unproductive building of that type to another, depending on which arrows you use). Objectives (If you play a scenario map (campaign) this button opens the list of objectives you need to reach at the moment). Mini-Map (Shows a mini-map, on which you can toggle on/off: terrain, conquered area, flags, roads, buildings (buttons from left to right, upper row first). Left-clicking the mini-map instantly moves your view to that position). Building Help toggles on/off the building help, which shows you what can be built on every field: flag=flag, hammer and hoe=mine, red hut=small building, yellow house=mid-sized building, green tower=large building. A flag may be built in any of these cases by choosing the \"build road\" button. Tribe's Ware Encyclopedia shows you all the wares of your tribe."
