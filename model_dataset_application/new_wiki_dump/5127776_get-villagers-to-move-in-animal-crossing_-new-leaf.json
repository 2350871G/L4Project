          "description":"Time travel involves abusing the time cycle by traveling forward two days, and then rewinding two days, thus speeding up the natural process. This way, you hit the natural cycle of animals moving out. Be careful, time travel has other consequences. It is possible that using this method will result in you losing a villager that you don\u2019t want to move out, especially if you are not vigilant in checking with all of the villagers to see if anyone is moving. To check with all of the villagers, simply talk to each one, preferably multiple times, by pressing \u201cA\u201d to see if there\u2019s any new gossip or someone brings up moving out. Remember, before attempting to get any villagers to move out, you must have at least eight villagers already moved in. All this really means is that if you just started the game, you\u2019ll need to wait a few days for the population to naturally increase before you can convince anyone to move out."

Hopefully, another villager will tell you that the villager you\u2019ve been ignoring is thinking of moving out soon, and you\u2019ll know it worked. Be careful: If you talk to the ignored villager after hearing they're going to move out, no matter what you say, the villager will then decide to stay instead of leave. For example, if you\u2019ve been particularly mean to a villager lately and ignoring him or her, the option \u201cGood luck!\u201d might be replaced with \u201cWho are you? !\u201d which then prompts that animal to stay."
