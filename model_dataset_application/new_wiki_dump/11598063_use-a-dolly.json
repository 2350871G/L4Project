Make sure the bottom plate is perfectly centered under your item. If it\u2019s not, there\u2019s a chance that the item may tip or slide once you get it lifted.Tip: When moving especially large or heavy objects, you may need to have another person assist you in raising one side of the item up enough to slip the bottom plate underneath."

As you do, keep one hand pressed against the front edge of your item (the side opposite the dolly) to help ease it back and prevent it from tipping in the wrong direction. You\u2019re now ready to begin moving. It\u2019s a good idea to have someone else stationed on the front side of the item just in case it rocks or shifts unexpectedly. Some dollies have molded handles on the rear edge that can make it easier to find and maintain a secure grip."

Push the dolly along with a slow, unhurried pace, feeling for changes in the distribution of the weight and making adjustments as needed. If you hold the dolly too upright, the item may pitch right off the front end. If you lean it back too much, more of the item\u2019s weight will be transferred to you, which can make moving difficult and dangerous. Avoid making sharp turns while your cargo is in motion, or stopping too abruptly when you reach your destination or pause to rest."

A utility dolly should be all you need to move a few boxes or light pieces of furniture, while a heavy-duty appliance dolly will make light work of your cooking and cleaning staples. For large, unwieldy pieces of decor, a flat furniture dolly will be your best best. Appliances dollies are just like standard utility dollies, only larger and able to support far more weight. They also usually come with their own straps, which can lend added security to difficult moving tasks. Furniture dollies have four wheels instead of two, and are designed to hold hundreds or even thousands of pounds. These features make loading and transporting even the most extravagant pieces a breeze."

If the boxes are all the same size, line their edges up with one another. If not, try to place them in the most stable configuration possible. Always load your boxes from heaviest to lightest, with the biggest, bulkiest boxes at the bottom of the stack.
