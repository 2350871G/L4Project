For example, a 50\u2013300 piece rectangular puzzle allows you to experiment with different methods for assembling your puzzle in a short amount of time. Graduate to a larger number of pieces (such as a puzzle with 300 \u2013 1000 pieces, or even larger) once you\u2019re confident assembling puzzles with the method you\u2019ve chosen. Also look for other challenges, like 3D puzzles, puzzles with only one color, multi-layered puzzles, and infinity puzzles. If the puzzle has a particularly large number of pieces, you may want to consider counting the pieces to make sure none are missing."
