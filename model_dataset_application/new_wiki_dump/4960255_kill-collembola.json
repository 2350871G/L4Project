You need to remove the fungi and dry out the area to kill the pests living there. Look for fungi in waterlogged areas of the home, like the corners of your basement or your bathtub.

Drying out these sources will dry out the springtails thriving on them. Leaky pipes are the most obvious and most common source of excess moisture in the home. Cracks and gaps in your windows and door frames can be another source. Weather-proof your doors and windows as needed to fill in these spaces. Apply caulk to small cracks and crevices as needed. If you have wooden windowsills, they may have undergone water damage due to leaky cracks. Change or treat the damaged wood. Then, prevent further problem by applying a waterproof finish to the wood."

          "description":"This might be difficult to do with outdoor plants, but if these pests are drawn to your indoor plants, you can usually kill them out by letting the soil of the plant dry out completely before providing more water. It is especially important to let your plants dry out if you are bringing outdoor plants inside. If you have Collembola outside, they may already be in your potted plants, regardless of whether or not you see them. Letting the soil dry out for a few days will kill the springtails living in the soil and reduce the risk of bringing them inside. Though soil springtails will stay within the pot."

When re-potting a plant overrun by Collembola, or more likely, mites, gently shake off as much of the soil as possible after removing the plant from its old container. Use as much fresh soil as possible. If you drag too much of the old soil into the new pot, the pests may remain. Consider adding gravel or a similar material to the bottom of the new pot to improve soil drainage. The new container should also have more drainage holes in its bottom than the old container has."

Collembola like to breed in those areas, so removing them will kills off the young animals already living there and prevent new ones from developing. Alternatively, you could leave the organic material where it is as Collembola are beneficial to soil fertility. When Collembola have made their way inside your home, which will only be the Siara  and Hypogastrura genera, focus on clearing away breeding grounds near the perimeter of your house. Piles of decaying leaves, mulch, and grass clippings can attract springtails, which is great for your garden and its biodiversity. Mulch, especially, should only be 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) deep to avoid attracting Collembola."

Most outdoor insecticides used against Collembola contain bifenthrin, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, deltamethrin, or diazinon. Some may also contain fluvalinate, malathion, prallethrin, or pyrethrins. You can apply outdoor pesticides as barrier treatments so that the animals will die as they try to enter your house, or you can apply the pesticide as a broadcast treatment to kill the Collembola living in a known source of infestation.

Spray any area where you spot collembola crawling around, as well as any area where you've spotted them in the past. Bear in mind- all the Collembola you will see are harmless and only annoying as a snow flea, when they can appear in their millions. Collembola are so small that you will not have much luck sweeping them away with a broom. Spraying water at these pests is the only way to physically remove them. If you still want to remove and kill these beautiful animals, you will need to mix in about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of dish soap for every 2 cups (500 ml) of water. The soap coats the animals, causing them to suffocate."

Be aware that even a professional pest control service won't be able to get rid of your collembola infestation quickly. You'll likely see continue to see signs of the springtails emerging from underground, below concrete slabs, beneath foundations, etc. Complete eradication may require 2-3 treatments."
