If you will be playing no-limit hold em 6 max at three tables, whatever charts and other playing guides that you may have can be used for all three tables. You do not want to play three tables with the first a no limit hold em tournament, the second a 6 maximum pot limit Omaha and the third table a heads up no limit hold em ring game. Start with full ring games, your decision making will be infrequent and playing up to four tables should be possible. With Sit n Gos, start each at a different time. At the crucial end stages, have just one game at critical play and have the other games at low or middle blind. Beside being rested, play ABC poker."
