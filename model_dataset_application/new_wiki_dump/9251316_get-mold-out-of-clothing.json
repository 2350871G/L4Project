Susan Stocker\t\t\tGreen Cleaning Expert\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Washing your clothes in hot water and vinegar will kill about 80% of mold spores, and it will also help with the unpleasant moldy smell. Pour the vinegar directly into the wash, and don't use any detergent. Fill the machine with hot water, then pause the cycle and let the clothes soak for about an hour. Finish the cycle, then wash the clothes again with regular detergent and non-chlorine bleach."

Let the fabric air dry on a flat surface or over a drying rack or drying line. If it\u2019s a nice day, you could also dry the item of clothing outdoors, in full sunlight. The sun\u2019s added heat will help kill off and remove whatever mold remains on your clothing. Avoid using the dryer. Wait until the item is air-dried to check for any mold, discoloration, and odd smells. Putting any fabric with mold issues into the dryer risks contaminating the dryer with mold spores."
