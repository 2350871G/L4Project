  "text":" Cooking the Rice Wash the rice. Pick through it to make sure there are no tiny stones or bits of debris, then run cool water over it to rinse it entirely. Place it in a medium-sized pot. Add the water. Pour it over the rice, then cover the pot. Cook the rice over medium-low heat. Continue cooking the rice, covered, until it is soft and plump, and the water is completely absorbed. This should take about 15 minutes. Take care not to burn the rice. If it seems to be cooking too quickly, turn down the heat. You can also cook the rice in a rice cooker. When it's finished cooking, transfer it to a pot before adding the milk. Adding the Milk Reduce the heat to low and add the milk. Pour the milk added with salt slowly and use a spoon to stir it into the rice. Make sure the heat is reduced so that the mixture simmers; if you keep it too high, the texture won't come out right. Simmer the rice and milk for ten minutes. Check to make sure it isn't cooking too quickly; if so, reduce the heat. While the rice is simmering, taste it to determine whether it needs a little more salt. Add a little at a time until it tastes right. It's not traditional in Sri Lanka to add extra ingredients, but you can sweeten the dish with a little sugar or make it more savory with pepper and other spices if you'd like to customize it. Remove the pot from heat. The dish will have the consistency of creamy porridge. Let it cool for about five minutes. Shaping the Rice Transfer the rice to a shallow dish. A wide, flat baking dish has the right shape. Use a spoon to scoop all of the rice into the dish and spread it evenly. Use a nonstick dish if you have one available, since rice tends to stick to the bottom of the pan. If you don't have a nonstick dish, oil the bottom of a glass or metal baking dish. Flatten the rice. Use the back of a wooden spoon to press the rice flat into the dish. You could also use a spatula or a piece of oiled waxed paper. Score the rice.
