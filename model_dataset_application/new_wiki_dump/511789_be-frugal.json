Remember - only buy things that you have the cash for in that week's money, or, save over to next week what you have towards the item and buy it then... you may have to do this for a couple of weeks, or longer, until you have enough money, but there is something very satisfying in buy in cash and knowing that you don't owe anyone anything for it and that the item is 100% yours. At the end of each week or month, pay what you have managed to save off something that you owe, or into a savings account - you'll be surprised at how quickly you clear debt, or how quickly it adds up in savings."
