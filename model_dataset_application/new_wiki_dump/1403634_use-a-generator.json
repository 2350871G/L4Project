Enclosed spaces can include not only rooms inside your house, but also a garage, basement, crawl space, etc. Carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, so even if you don\u2019t see or smell any fumes, you may be in danger if you use the portable generator indoors. If you feel dizzy, sick, or weak when using a generator, get away immediately and seek fresh air. Keep your generator at least 20 feet away from any open windows or doors, as fumes can enter your home through these. You can install portable, battery-operated carbon monoxide detectors in your home.
