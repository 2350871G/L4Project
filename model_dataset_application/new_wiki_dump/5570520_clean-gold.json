          "description":"This method is the gentlest way to clean gold. If the gold is a very soft 18- or 24-karat gold, it may be scratched by other methods. However, the cleaning agents in the dish soap may loosen gemstones, diamonds, and other set stones. If you think a stone may be coming loose on your jewelry, take it to a jeweler to be reset. Otherwise it may fall out and get lost."

          "description":"Pour about a tablespoon of dish soap into a dry glass bowl. Adding the soap before the water will help the dish soap mix in evenly. Next, fill the bowl with water. The water should be hot, but not so hot that you can\u2019t touch it. If you\u2019re cleaning gold jewelry set with pearls, add a few drops of baby oil to the cleaning mixture. This will help protect the pearls from damage.

I recommend putting the soap directly onto the toothbrush with a little water. Then, clean the jewelry very, very lightly."

If you\u2019re cleaning jewelry with pearls, stones, or settings, skip the soaking and immediately start cleaning the jewelry. Clean the gold by scrubbing it with a clean, soft bristled toothbrush. Take care not to scratch the surface. If you don\u2019t want to use a toothbrush, you can also use an eyebrow brush or a brush made specifically for cleaning jewelry. Use a new toothbrush when cleaning jewelry. Old toothbrushes may have toothpaste residue that will scratch the gold."
