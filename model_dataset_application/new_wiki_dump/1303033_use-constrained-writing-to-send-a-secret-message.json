However, you should try to keep your messages short. Longer messages can be difficult to encode and may be noticed by people that shouldn't see them. For example, you might want to hide a message like \u201cHELP IN DANGER\u201d\nYou would likely want to avoid a message like \u201cPLEASE HELP ME I AM IN DANGER\u201d."

It's important that you use each letter of your phrase or word in the acrostic code. If you wanted to hide the word \u201cHELP\u201d, you would need to use H, E, L, and P in your message. Make sure you don't miss any letters, as this can change the code. For example, missing the letter L in \u201cHELP\u201d would result in the code reading \u201cHEP\u201d."

The code will be revealed by reading each first letter of every sentence. Make sure each letter is included in the document you are creating to ensure the code will be readable. As an example, imagine that you are trying to encode the word \u201cHELP\u201d. Your first sentence would have to start with the letter H.  \u201cHow is everyone at home?\u201d would be a good choice. The next sentence would need to start with the letter E.  \u201cEverything still going well in town?\u201d could be used in this case. Continue in this way until the message is fully encoded. It's important that your sentences and message don't draw attention to the encoded message. Keep your tone and content neutral and natural."

Every sentence in your document should start with a letter from your original message. If you read the first letter of each sentence, you should find your original message. If you missed any letters, add them to your encoded message to make sure it's readable. Make sure you didn't add any sentences that aren't part of the code. This could change the meaning of the original message you were trying to encode. \u201cHow is everyone at home? Everything still good? Looking forward to coming back.

Check out some of these examples to get a good understanding of the keyboard code:\nThere are three rows on the keyboard, one starting with Q, the next starting with A and the last starting with Z.
