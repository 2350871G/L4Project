      "description":"This can be made out of a box of a considerable size, for example a shoebox. Make sure that your stuffed chick will be comfortable in it. You can sew a mini pillow and duvet if you like, and put a little lamp by their bed. If you'd like, you can be creative and decorate the box for your stuffed chick's bed."

      "description":"Don't use real water; just do a pretend dip, otherwise the chick may not dry properly and it might grow mildew or become stinky. You can get a rubber duck for the chick's friend and that can have a bath instead."

    {
      "headline":"Feed the stuffed chick.",
      "description":"Use pretend food that is made out of clay. You can make food from coloured paper cut into pieces. Give this to your chick as food. Try modelling real food that chicks eat such as grain and mealworms. Do not feed your stuffed chick real food. Real food might leave stains on the stuffed toy, which can attract silverfish or other insects that might chew on your toy and ruin it."

      "headline":"Let your stuffed chick go to the bathroom.",
      "description":"Chickens go to the bathroom anywhere outside, but you can house train yours and use a small container for it, such as a washed margarine container. Fill it with scrunched paper to pretend it's soil or kitty litter."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Brush the stuffed chick's teeth.",
      "description":"Use a brush that no one uses anymore, or a new one from the dollar store that's just for you to play with. Do not use toothpaste; it will get stuck on the stuffed toy and it's very hard to remove. If you'd like, you can make your own toothbrush for your stuffed chick."

    {
