When your Blitz Pile is empty, shout \u201cBlitz!\u201d and the round is over. Scoring a Game Count the number of cards remaining in your Blitz Pile. Once a round has ended, each player counts the number of cards that they have left in their Blitz Pile. The number on each card isn\u2019t relevant, just count the total number of cards left in the pile. Keep the Blitz Pile nearby as you organize the rest of the cards and count them. Gather and sort the cards in the Dutch Piles. Remove the Dutch Piles from the center and have each player sort them into matching decks of cards. Stack your deck of cards and set it aside. Don\u2019t combine the cards from your Dutch Pile with the Blitz Pile or any of the cards you have left in your hand or Wood Pile. Take your deck and count the cards that were played in the Dutch Piles. Count the total number of cards that were played in your Dutch Pile. Have each of the other players do the same to get a total number of cards. Do not count the number on the card. Each card counts as 1. Give both numbers to the scorekeeper to compute. Tell the scorekeeper how many cards were in your Dutch Pile and how many were in your Blitz Pile. They will be able to tally and keep track of the total scores before you move on to the next round. Use a notebook to write down the scores for easy reference.Tip: Try using the memo or notes app on a smartphone to keep track of scores if you don\u2019t have a notebook to write in. Add 1 point for the cards in the Dutch Pile and subtract 2 for the cards in the Blitz Pile. To calculate each player\u2019s score for the round that ended, count the total number of cards in their Dutch Pile and subtract 2 from that number for each card left in their Blitz Pile. That is their score for that round. For example, if you have a Dutch Pile of 19 cards and you have 3 cards left in your Blitz Pile, your total score for that round is 13. Continue to play rounds until a player reaches 75 total points. Once a round is over and the scores have been tallied, start up another round! The game ends whenever 1 player reaches a total score of 75 or higher. If 2 players score past 75 at the same time, whoever has the highest score wins.",
