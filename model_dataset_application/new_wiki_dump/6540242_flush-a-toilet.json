          "description":"If you\u2019re having trouble flushing the toilet, start by checking the connections between the handle, flush chain, and flapper. Sometimes the chain can get disconnected from the handle or flapper, which prevents the toilet from flushing. If the chain is disconnected, grab the loose end and slide a link onto the hook at the end of the handle arm. The tank water is fresh, not toilet water, so don\u2019t worry about reaching into it. When you flush the toilet, the handle arm pulls the flush chain and lifts the flapper, which allows water to flow into the bowl from the tank."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Ensure the flapper chain is taught.",
          "description":"Make sure the chain has no more than 2 links of slack. If the chain isn\u2019t taught, it won\u2019t lift the flapper when you jiggle the handle. With the tank cover off, jiggle the handle and see if handle arm inside the tank pulls the chain enough to lift the flapper. If the chain is loose, detach it from the hook at the end of the handle arm. Hook a chain link onto the arm so there\u2019s less than 2 links of slack on the chain when the flapper is down. The chain shouldn\u2019t be so taught that it pulls the flapper up when the handle is in the normal position."

          "description":"Try reaching into the tank and shifting around the flapper, or the rubber part at the base of the tank that\u2019s connected to the chain. When the flapper is down, it should make a tight seal, which keeps water from entering the bowl. If the toilet runs constantly, the flush will be weak, and the flapper seal is most likely to blame. The flapper might need a quick adjustment. If shifting it fixes the seal, the toilet will stop running and it\u2019ll flush normally. If the chain came loose, it might have gotten stuck under the flapper and prevented it from sealing properly. If the flapper is worn, it won\u2019t fit into its seating properly, and you\u2019ll need to replace it."

It\u2019ll be easier to work without water in the tank. If lifting the flapper doesn\u2019t drain all of the water from the tank, remove as much as you can with a cup, then absorb the rest with towels."

If you feel any buildup, scrub the rim with a mineral deposit cleaner and nylon scrubbing pad. Don\u2019t use steel wool or any other material that\u2019s more abrasive than nylon. Mineral deposits or other buildup could prevent the flapper from sealing. If the flapper isn\u2019t worn, turn the water back on, flush the toilet, and see cleaning the rim solved your problem."

          "description":"If the bottom of the flapper is worn out, find where it\u2019s attached to the long overflow tube that comes out of the tank\u2019s bottom. Slide the flapper\u2019s rubber hooks off of the ear on the tube, then detach the chain that connects the flapper to the handle arm. Take the flapper to your local hardware store to find a match. If you can\u2019t find a match, a universal flapper should do the trick. Slide the new flapper\u2019s rubber hooks onto the tube\u2019s ear, then attach the flush chain. Turn the water back on, and see if your toilet flushes normally. If your toilet still won\u2019t flush or flushes weakly, you might have a clog, need to adjust the water level, or have a problem that requires a professional plumber."

  "text":" Fixing the Flapper Remove the tank cover and check for connection problems. If you\u2019re having trouble flushing the toilet, start by checking the connections between the handle, flush chain, and flapper. Sometimes the chain can get disconnected from the handle or flapper, which prevents the toilet from flushing. If the chain is disconnected, grab the loose end and slide a link onto the hook at the end of the handle arm. The tank water is fresh, not toilet water, so don\u2019t worry about reaching into it. When you flush the toilet, the handle arm pulls the flush chain and lifts the flapper, which allows water to flow into the bowl from the tank. Ensure the flapper chain is taught. Make sure the chain has no more than 2 links of slack. If the chain isn\u2019t taught, it won\u2019t lift the flapper when you jiggle the handle. With the tank cover off, jiggle the handle and see if handle arm inside the tank pulls the chain enough to lift the flapper. If the chain is loose, detach it from the hook at the end of the handle arm. Hook a chain link onto the arm so there\u2019s less than 2 links of slack on the chain when the flapper is down. The chain shouldn\u2019t be so taught that it pulls the flapper up when the handle is in the normal position. Test the flapper seal.

Plunging Like a Pro Give a clogged toilet 10 minutes to drain. Find the supply valve behind the toilet, and turn it clockwise to shut off the water as soon as you can.

Lift the valve upward when you hear a click or feel it disengage from the base. Look under the flush valve and find the silicone seal. The silicone seal does the same job as a standard toilet\u2019s rubber flapper. Ensure it\u2019s seated tightly in the underside of the flush valve, and check it for damage. Replace the flush valve seal if it\u2019s worn. If the seal is damaged, purchase a matching replacement online or at the hardware store. Peel the old seal out of the flush valve, slide the new one into place, then twist the flush valve clockwise back into its housing. Be sure to line up the color-coded partial and full flush buttons correctly. The buttons on the valve line up with pegs attached to buttons on the tank lid. Match the colors or symbols so you don\u2019t install the flush valve backwards. If you can\u2019t find a seal that matches your flush valve, or if the valve itself is damaged, replace the entire unit. Find the correct part for your toilet at a hardware store or order one from the manufacturer.",
