Grind the nuts until they reach the texture that you desire. Make sure not to over-grind your nuts, or you'll create a nut butter with them. Using 1 to 2 cups (125 grams to 250 grams) of nuts will be enough for most recipes. Decide on whether you want a coarse or light coating for your food.If you want a finer coating, grind up your nuts more. You can use blanched, unblanched, whole, sliced, slivered, or toasted nuts."
