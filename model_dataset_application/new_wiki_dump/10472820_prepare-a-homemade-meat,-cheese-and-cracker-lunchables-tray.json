      "headline":"Prepare the meat.",
      "description":"Lunchables use several types of meat in their meals. They offer ham, turkey and even sometimes bologna. You will need two to three slices of medium-sliced meat to use. The meat for these dishes is generally cut into circular shapes no wider than one inch in diameter; however, you can cut them to your liking. Stack them up in a pile and place them in one of the smaller sections of the tray. Lunchables sets each contain six slices total."

      "headline":"Prepare, cut and stack the cheese.",
      "description":"Lunchables serves their meat-cheese-crackers combinations with cheese choices as American or Cheddar Cheese. However, you can substitute Swiss or any cheese you'd like. Make sure that it can be cut into thicker slices. In most Lunchables' trays, you'll find six slices of cheese. The cheese is cut into rectangular pieces that are 1 inch by 1/2 inch and stacked going the same direction. #* After you stack, place the cheese in another section of your tray."

      "description":"Lunchables trays often include 2 Chips Ahoy or 2 Oreo cookies, but you can obviously customize as you'd wish. These tend to be served in the biggest sections of the meal tray; if they don't fit, you can always store them separately, in a Ziploc bag or similar separate container."
