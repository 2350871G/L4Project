          "description":"Avoid shriveled, dried up or moldy berries. Avoid soggy strawberries too, as this means they are past their prime. A good strawberry is firm and shiny. Choose organic strawberries, if you can, as non-organic strawberries can be quite pesticide-laden. Some cooks believe smaller strawberries have more flavor due to a higher concentration of sugars."

          "headline":"Rinse strawberries under running water when you are ready to eat them.",
          "description":"Only rinse strawberries right before you plan to eat them, as washing them will cause them to go bad more quickly. Rub the berries gently under running water to make sure each berry is clean and free of as much soil as possible. Most strawberries sold at the grocery store are fairly clean, so a brief rinsing should do the trick. If you plan to freeze your strawberries, wash them first. Strawberries can become mushy if they are under water too long. A quicker rinse will help them keep their firm texture. Rinse non-organic strawberries more thoroughly and consider using a drop of mild dish soap or white vinegar to clean them."

        {
          "headline":"Dry the strawberries thoroughly after washing them.",
          "description":"Let the strawberries drain in a colander or place them on a paper towel to soak up any excess water. If you are only rinsing a few strawberries, pat them gently with a towel to dry them more quickly. Drying strawberries after washing them will help keep them from getting mushy. The more moisture strawberries soak up, the more mushy the texture will be."

          "headline":"Hull and slice the strawberries right before you want to eat them.",
          "description":"Hull the berries by removing the green cap and pale flesh with a paring knife or a strawberry huller. On a fully ripe strawberry, you can hull it by gently pulling on the leaves until the stem comes out. Slice them, if you prefer, by standing them on the flat edge and using a paring knife to cut them in half or smaller. The stem of a strawberry keeps it fresher for longer. Only remove it when you are ready to eat the strawberry."

Rinse and dry the strawberries. Store them in the fridge in a partially covered container lined with a paper towel. The vinegar kills spores that form mold on strawberries. Strawberries can last up to a couple of weeks using this method. You won't need to rinse your strawberries again when you are ready to eat them if you soak them in vinegar."

Then, take the strawberries out of the water and let them cool and dry on a paper towel. Repack them and store them in the fridge. If you frequently buy berries, only to have them go bad the next day in the fridge, try this method. You won't need to rinse your strawberries again when you are ready to eat them if you use a heat bath."

Freeze them for around 1-4 hours, until they are frozen solid. Remove the frozen strawberries from the baking sheet and place them in freezer-safe storage bags. Put the strawberries back into the freezer for up to 6 months. Frozen strawberries are good for smoothies, pies, cobblers, crisps, and compotes. To help the strawberries freeze faster, slice them into halves or quarters. It's also much easier to cut fresh strawberries than frozen strawberries."

          "description":"Frozen strawberries have the same nutritional content and flavor as fresh strawberries, but they will lose their texture and become mushy when you defrost them. Typically, they are best for baking and smoothies, as cooking or blending strawberries makes them lose their texture anyway. Try adding frozen strawberries to smoothies, oatmeal, or cakes. Frozen strawberries are usually good for about 6 months."

Blend until smooth, and add a little warm water if you want a looser texture. You can also add different berries, or use maple syrup instead of honey."

In another bowl, mix 2 lightly beaten eggs with 4 tbsp (60 g) of melted butter, 1 cup (250 g) of vanilla yogurt and 1 1/2 cups (375 mL) of buttermilk. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Cook around 1/4 cup (60 mL) of the batter on a griddle at a time. Top with sliced strawberries. You can also add the sliced strawberries directly into the pancake mix, if you prefer.

          "description":"In a large bowl, crush 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of strawberries in batches using a wooden spoon. Add the crushed strawberries into a large saucepan with 4 cups (800 g) of white sugar and the juice of one lemon. Stir the mixture over a low heat until it comes to a boil. Keep boiling until the mixture reaches 220 \u00b0F (104 \u00b0C). This recipe will make around 40 fluid ounces (1.2 L) of jam, so it's useful to have at least 3 16-ounce (.5 L) mason jars with lids sterilized and ready to store the jam in. This makes an excellent gift if you can't eat all the jam yourself."
