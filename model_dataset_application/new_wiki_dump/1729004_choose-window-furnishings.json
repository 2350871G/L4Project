          "description":"Hard window furnishings are typically made of wood or PVC and include shutters and blinds. These types of window treatments are great for controlling the amount of sunlight in the room and providing privacy. Blinds are made up of slats, which can be tilted or angled to control the amount and direction of light in the room. Shutters are more durable and stationary window treatments, that are typically attached to the window with hinges that you can open and shut. Blinds are the perfect choice if you\u2019re on a budget. They\u2019re typically the cheapest window treatment option. Shutters are usually pretty expensive. You can have them custom fit to your window, or you can purchase stock options at your local home improvement store."

          "description":"Layered window treatments combine both hard and soft window furnishings. In addition to adding depth and dimension, layering can add additional insulation, light blocking, and privacy that window furnishing alone can\u2019t provide. In order to layer your window furnishings like a professional, you\u2019ll first need to choose a base (blinds or shades), and then a layer on top (drapery) that complements the style of your home. Start with a sheer base for a more elegant look. If you\u2019re decorating a casual space, use woven wood or cellular shades for the base. Finish up a formal, elegant look by adding both valances and curtain panels over your base. If you\u2019re going for a lighter look, choose sheer curtains over the base of your choice."

They come in a variety of materials, such as PVC, fabric, faux wood, genuine wood, or even metal. Vertical blinds are a great option for windows that are wider than they are tall and are particularly popular on patio doors.
