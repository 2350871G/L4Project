          "description":"As with any plant, certain types of grapes grow better in different areas and offer up different flavors and appearances. There are three general types of grapes: American, European, and Muscadine grapes. American grapes grow best in warm, sunny climates like that of central California. European grapes are common in Europe and Northern parts of the US, and Muscadine grapes are commonly found in the Southern US. Within each general type of grapevine, there are multiple species to choose from which each offer up their own flavor, color, texture, and size. Visit a local nursery to find one that fits your needs and environment. Select plants that look healthy and strong, and are 1 year old. When possible, get them certified virus-free to ensure that their healthy growth is continued. Look for plants that have an even root distribution, and whose canes are symmetrical."

          "description":"If you or a friend has another grapevine you\u2019d like to plant from, you can take a cutting and plant it in a new location. To use your own cuttings: Cut the sections directly from the vine or from brush that has recently been pruned off. Make sure the cutting is 3 nodes long (the nodes will look like bumps). At the bottom of the cutting, make the cut at an angle. This cut should be at 45 degrees and 1/4 to 1-inch above the node. When taking cuttings, plant as many as possible - in as many locations as possible - to have a higher chance of success. Surplus plants can be given away."

          "headline":"Select a suitable location.",
          "description":"Grapevines are long term plants that can live between 50 and 100 years. Therefore, make sure that the location you select is a permanent one that will offer up plenty of room for future grapevines. Grapevines thrive in sloped and hilly areas that offer up plenty of drainage and sunlight. When possible, plant your grapevines on a downward slope on a south-facing hill, in an area clear of other trees and large plants. In cold areas be sure to plant the grapevines in a sunny area, preferably facing south. A southern facing location may prevent frost nipping the vines. Also avoid \"frost pockets\" such as low-lying areas or the base of a slope, where cold air can pool and ruin a crop. If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, north-facing slopes are sunnier."

          "headline":"Prepare the soil.",
          "description":"Grapevines are a bit picky about their soil conditions, so make sure your are just right before planting. Use soil that slightly rocky or sandy with a pH just above 7. Amend the soil to promote good drainage if necessary, as water-logged roots are not conducive to healthy growing grapevines. For best results, take a soil sample to an agricultural extension office or soil testing laboratory for a complete soil test. This is usually cheap or free. If this is not possible, test the soil pH with an at-home kit and add pH adjusters to your soil if necessary. Although it may seem counterintuitive, grapevines do not like soil that is too nutrient-rich. Avoid heavily fertilized soil when possible, and follow recommendations from a soil test result or an experienced local grower."

          "description":"Grapevines are, as the name implies, vine plants that grow upwards along a support structure. If you are not planting your grapes along a fence or other structure, construct or buy a trellis for them to grow along. This is typically a wooden structure made of intertwined boards that allow the vines to wrap around them, providing a sturdy support system. Latticed wood and wire can be purchased and attached to fence posts for an easy homemade trellis, if you don\u2019t have the funds or ability to purchase or make your own. Don\u2019t use a single stake (as you might for tomato plants) as this won\u2019t provide enough support for your vines once they start growing."
