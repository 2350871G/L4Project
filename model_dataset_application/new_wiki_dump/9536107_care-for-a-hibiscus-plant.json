          "description":"Hibiscus plants aren\u2019t that particular about their soil mix, but they prefer lightweight material such as loam and peat moss. A regular bag of potting soil will usually work just fine. You can create their ideal soil conditions by mixing 1 part garden loam, 1 part peat moss, and 1 part fine sand or bark. A mix of 1 part coarse peat, 1 part composted bark, and 1 part composted manure mixed with a little bit of leca and vermiculite is also a great soil mix for hibiscuses."

          "description":"Loamy soil provides good drainage, but it's also important to grow hibiscuses in containers or planters that have plenty of drainage holes. After a watering, the environment should drain completely to prevent root rot. Water your plant, then watch for the water to come out of the drainage holes. Let the water drain into the plastic tray underneath. Give the roots time to soak up the excess water, but if water is still in the tray after 12 hours, dump it out."

If it feels dry, your plant needs to be watered. If it feels damp and slightly spongy, the soil is wet enough. Overwatering can cause root rot, so always touch the soil before watering."

Use a thermometer or touch the water with your hand before administering it to check the temperature. Avoid using water that's much hotter than 95\u00b0F (35\u00b0C), since they don't like overly warm water either."

          "description":"Hibiscuses will grow without direct sunlight, but they won\u2019t bloom without at least 1 to 2 hours of direct sunlight every day. Place your hibiscus plants in a sunny window. Keep the plants 1 in (2.5 cm) to 2 in (5.1 cm) away from the window glass, since the hot glass can damage their foliage and blooms. With the proper amount of sunlight, hibiscus plants will bloom from spring until fall."

Apply a slow-release fertilizer (like 20-20-20 or 10-10-10) or a specially formulated hibiscus fertilizer around the base of the plant. Look for a fertilizer with trace elements like iron and magnesium, which support growth and blooming. You can also mix up a weak solution of water-soluble fertilizer (half strength or less) and dose your plants with a little fertilizer each time you water them. Avoid over-fertilizing since too much phosphorus can kill hibiscus plants."

To test your soil's drainage, dig a hole that\u2019s about 12 in (30 cm) wide and 12 in (30 cm) deep. Fill the hole with water. If the water drains in 10 minutes or less, your soil drains well. If it takes an hour or more to drain, the drainage is poor. To improve drainage, mix in organic matter like well-rotted manure, compost, or peat moss.
