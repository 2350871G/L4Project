It will conduct further research on the red planet and answer key questions about the possibility of life on Mars. Stay informed of everything that is sent into space. Launches are very frequent, sending up satellites and supplies for the International Space Station.

Planets, constellations, satellites, and shooting stars can all be observed if you look carefully. The ideal conditions for observation are a clear night with good weather and a location far from big population centers. Check to see what objects will be visible on a particular night so you know what to look for. Check the weather report for rain or clouds. Consider planning a camping trip to coincide with a meteor shower. National and state parks have campgrounds and the added benefit of being away from cities with light pollution.
