  "text":" Holey heart cookies Add the butter and soft sugar in a bowl. Stir until well mixed and creamy in texture. Pour in the maple syrup. Stir through. Separate the egg white and yolk. Add the egg yolk to the cookie batter. Put the white of the egg to one side. Add the flour. Mix through well by stirring or using your fingers. Then knead lightly and quickly to form a dough. Wrap the dough in plastic kitchen wrap or greaseproof paper. Place in the refrigerator. Leave to chill for a half an hour. While the dough is chilling, make the sugar coating for the cookies. Pour the superfine/caster sugar into a bowl, add 2 drops of coloring and stir well. Spread across a plate or spare baking sheet to air dry. Remove from the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC/350\u00baF. Roll out the dough on a floured surface. Roll to a thickness of about 5mm/ 1/4 inch. Cut out the heart cookies. Use the large cookie cutter to cut out the cookies. Arrange the cookies on a parchment-covered cookie sheet. Cut out the middle of the cookies. Use the smaller cookie cutter to cut out a heart shape inside the cookies. Align carefully to keep straight. Continue until all the dough is used up. Use the cut out dough to keep rolling and making more cookies. Beat the egg white briefly for a few seconds. Brush egg white onto each cookie. Sprinkle with the colored sugar you made earlier. It is easier to do in batches than to brush all of the cookies at once, to avoid drying too quickly. Bake the cookies. Place the cookies into the oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Or, until they begin to turn golden brown. Remove from the oven. Leave on the baking tray for up to 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire cooling rack to complete the cooling. Serve when cooled. Store in an airtight container. These cookies must be eaten within a week. Neapolitan heart cookies Add the butter and sugar to the mixing bowl. Mix to combine well until smooth and creamy. Add the vanilla and salt. Mix. Add the flour gradually, stirring in each addition.  Knead the dough quickly on a floured surface. Use your fingertips to keep it cool. Divide the dough into three portions. You can use your eye or weigh the portions. Make the chocolate portion. Wrap a cutting board in kitchen plastic wrap. Sprinkle the board with cocoa. Place one third of the dough onto the board. Knead to completely incorporate the cocoa powder. Roll into a ball and place to one side. Renew the plastic covering on the board. Place the next dough third on the board and add a few drops of the pink food coloring. Knead to completely change the color of the dough to pink. Roll into a ball and set aside. The intensity of the pink or rose color is up to you but it's always wise to start out with only a drop or two and build on that. Roll out the final third of the dough. Roll it between two sheets of plastic kitchen wrap to prevent sticking. Roll to a thickness of about 9.5mm/ 3/8 inch, in the shape of a square. Cut strips from the square. The strips should measure 2cm/ 3/4 inch in width across. Remove the dough by leaving it on the plastic wrap and onto a pre-lined cookie sheet. Put to one side. Repeat the same process with both the chocolate and pink dough sections. Each time, slide the strips onto the cookie sheet. Chill the dough strips. Place in the refrigerator to chill for half an hour. Do not have anything strong smelling in the refrigerator while chilling the cookie dough. Make an egg wash. Mix the egg and water in a small bowl. This forms the \"glue\" that keeps the dough strips together as one. Cover a work surface with plastic kitchen wrap to prevent sticking.  Lift one strip of chocolate dough and place on the plastic sheet. Brush the egg wash over the side of the dough strip. Transfer a pink strip on top of the chocolate slice. Do this with care and align well. Brush the side of the pink dough with egg wash. Transfer a white strip of dough onto the pink strip. Again, brush with egg wash. Continue in this manner until all strips of the dough are place together in the same pattern. The end pieces of dough or dough that has been over-handled and has lost the striped pattern will no longer make such pretty hearts but can be rolled and cooked as normal shaped cookies with a marbled pattern, which is still fun and tastes the same. Cover the finished dough with more kitchen plastic wrap. Gently roll over the top to ease the edges of the cookie strips together. Do not press hard! Return the whole sheet to the refrigerator to chill for half an hour. Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC/350\u00baF. Line a cookie sheet. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Peel the plastic wrap off the top of the dough. Use a heart-shaped cookie cutter to press through the dough and form cookies. The cookies will be formed from the three different dough colors, in stripes. Move each cut cookie to the cookie sheet. Do not touch the sides of the newly formed cookies, leave a small distance between each cookie. Use a spatula to transfer the cut cookies, this will be gentler and helps them to keep their shape. Place the cookies into the oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the vanilla section starts to brown a little. Remove from the oven. Let sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes, then transfer to the cooling rack to complete cooling. Serve when cooled. Store in an airtight container. Shortbread heart cookies Preheat the oven to 160\u00baC/320\u00baF. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Cream the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl. Either do by hand or with an electric mixer. Add the sifted flours to the creamed mixture. Mix into a soft dough using a flat-bladed butter knife. Transfer to a floured work surface. Knead gently and quickly for 30 seconds, using only the fingertips. Roll out the dough on a floured surface. Using a heart shaped cookie cutter, cut out cookie shapes. Arrange each cookie on the cookie sheet. Prick a few holes into each cookie with a fork. Sprinkle with sugar. Place in the oven. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until firm and lightly golden. Remove from the oven. Let sit on the sheet for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire cooling rack to complete the cooling. Serve when cooled. Store in an airtight container. For a special touch, decorate the cookies. Melt white or milk chocolate. Dip half of the cookie into chocolate to cover. Let set. Yum!",
