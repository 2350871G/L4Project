          "description":"Working with hot grease is a recipe for disaster. Burning yourself with grease won't help you get rid of it any faster. Not only can hot grease burn you, it can also burn through your trash bag or shatter a glass jar. It's better to be safe than sorry. Allow your grease to cool for at least 2 hours; adjust for more cooling time based on the volume of grease. If there's an unavoidable time-crunch for your grease disposal, you can line a cup with heavy duty foil and very carefully pour the hot grease into the cup. Place the cup in the freezer, and later remove the foil along with the frozen fat."

If there is a small amount of grease to dispose of, use a paper towel to wipe it out of the pan. For a large amount of grease, pour it into a sealable, disposable container. Since your grease container is going in the trash, try to use a container that would not otherwise be recyclable. If you don't have a container you're willing to part with, pour the grease into a dish and refrigerate until it solidifies. Then, scrape the grease out into the trash with a rubber spatula, and conclude by washing the dish. If you know you're going to be eating a lot of bacon and tossing the grease, think ahead. Save non-recyclable containers to use as grease-disposal vessels the next time you make a bacon batch."
