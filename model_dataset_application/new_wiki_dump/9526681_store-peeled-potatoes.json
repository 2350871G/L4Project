Once the water runs clear, set the potatoes aside on a layer of paper towels and gently pat them dry. If you\u2019re preparing a large batch, take care of all your peeling at once, then transfer the potatoes to a strainer and rinse them together. When you peel a potato, the liquid starches inside are exposed to air and quickly begin turning the potato a dark pink or brown hue. Giving them a quick rinse washes away excess starches to slow the discoloration process."

This can drastically cut down on prep and cooking time later. Otherwise, it\u2019s okay to leave them whole. They\u2019ll keep for about the same amount of time either way. Use a knife that\u2019s nice and sharp. Dull knives do unnecessary damage to the potato, releasing more of the enzymes that lead to spoilage. Dice the potatoes into 1.5\u20132 inches (3.8\u20135.1 cm) cubes for mashed potatoes, or slice them into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) slices for dishes like homemade potato chips or potatoes au gratin. The smaller the potatoes are cut, the faster they\u2019ll take on water. For this reason, it may be best to wait right up to the minute to prep spuds for dishes like hashbrowns, home fries, or vegetable medleys."

Add water to about the halfway point, making sure to leave adequate room for the quantity of potatoes you\u2019re working with. Avoid overfilling the bowl, or it may overflow when you add the potatoes. If mashed potatoes are on the menu, run the water directly into a cooking pot instead of a bowl. When you\u2019re ready to get dinner going, you can simply place the pot on the stovetop and heat the water to a boil."

For a standard 2\u20135 US-quart (2,000\u20135,000 ml) mixing bowl, this will be about \u00bd-1\u00bc tablespoon. The acidic component shouldn\u2019t impact the flavor of the cooked potatoes."
