          "description":"If you got the cloned plants from an outside source, be sure to quarantine them before planting them. Place them in a separate room from the rest of your plants for 3-5 days. During this time, examine the plants for fungus or pests that could spread to your other plants. Twisted, blistered, and wet-looking leaves are an indication of broad mites or russet mites. Small specks or bite marks on leaves are a sign of spider mites. Yellow spots on the leaves indicate a fungus called leaf septoria. White spots, fuzzy patches, or powdery-looking leaves are signs of white powdery mildew."

          "description":"Fortunately, both pests and fungi can be treated using the same method. Get a foliar pest or fungal control product from a garden shop or marijuana supply store. Pour the liquid into a container large enough that you can fit the clones in. Dip each clone in the solution, then let it dry completely before planting. Be sure to wear gloves to avoid getting the product on your hands. If your skin does come into contact with the liquid, wash them with warm water and soap immediately. You also need to avoid contact with your eyes."

In order to avoid contamination, you should use new pots or sterilize used pots before planting clones in them. Spray or dip used pots in bleach or hydrogen peroxide to remove any leftover biological residue from previous plants. Let the pots dry completely before using them. It\u2019s best to transplant clones into small or medium-sized pots, rather than large ones, to ensure the nutrients in the soil aren\u2019t drained off and wasted during watering."

Soil should contain high nitrogen levels for clones, as opposed to soil with high phosphorus levels for flowering plants. Ensure the pH of the soil you choose to use is right around 6 for best results. It\u2019s important to purchase new soil, rather than reusing soil, to ensure that the clones aren\u2019t contaminated with pests or fungus from other plants."
