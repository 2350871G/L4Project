          "description":"Nowadays, advancements in home brewing have made it possible for small brewing companies to pop up locally. Many of these small brewing companies do not use many or any chemical additives, partially to appeal to the organic niche, but also to cut down on costs. Look in a phone book or local directory for nearby brewing companies. Contact any companies you do find and inquire about whether they have any organic brews. You can also try looking at a local farmer\u2019s market. Beer is a product made from natural ingredients, after all, and many farmer\u2019s markets sell food and drink products made from locally grown crops as well as the crops themselves. These markets are a good place to look for organic goods to begin with, since many small farmers run organic farms."

          "description":"Not every product in a natural foods store is organic, but many are and many others at least contain organic components. Since these stores are naturally small, the selection of beer or other alcoholic beverages there might be limited. If the store owner did not get a state permit to sell alcohol, it may not even carry any. Many natural food stores do have organic beer, though, and the selection will likely be large enough to give you a basic selection."

Moreover, the interest in organic food and drink only seems to be increasing as time goes on. As a result, it will be much easier to find organic beer at your local supermarket now than it would have been five years ago. The selection of organic beers will probably be notably less than the selection of non-organic beers, but you should at least be able to find something."

A product labeled as \u201c100% organic\u201d uses all natural ingredients that have been organically produced, and the product itself contains no chemicals. A product simply labeled as \u201corganic\u201d is at least 95 percent organic, but less than 100 percent. Usually, this means that some small trace of chemical was used during the bottling process. Note that beers containing less than 95 percent organic ingredients but more than 70 percent can also say \"made with organic ingredients\" on the label, but any food or drink containing less than 70 percent cannot use the word \"organic\" on the label at all."

Secondly, reviews also give you a good idea about the taste of the beer. Buying organic is great, but that is no reason to give up on taste. Checking out reviews before you buy will give you a good idea of what to expect as far as flavor is concerned. Go to a website that sells or reviews beer, but do not rely solely on the brewing company\u2019s website to provide you with accurate reviews. The reviews on a brewing company\u2019s website could be filtered or skewed."
