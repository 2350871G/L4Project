  "text":" Prepare the Meat Stuffing Chop onions and put in a large frying pan.  Drizzle the vegetable oil in the pan.  Heat the stove to a low/medium temperature.  Cook onions to a light brown.  Add the ground beef and stir occasionally to keep the meat from burning.  Cook for about 5 minutes and proceed.  Add the spices and salt to the cooking meat. Let this combination cook for another 5 minutes, or until the meat is thoroughly cooked. Add pine nuts and continue to cook, while stirring frequently for about 3 more minutes. This will prevent the pine nuts from overcooking. Preparing the Dough Combine the dough ingredients in a large mixing bowl.  Use a food processor (or knead with your hands) to thoroughly mix in each ingredient. Let the dough rest for about 10 minutes. Preparing the Dumplings Cover a clean, flat surface with flour. Clean a flat surface, like a kitchen table, and cover it with flour. Flatten the dough using a rolling pin to about 1/8th inches thick.  Use a small bottle lid, or cookie cutter to cut the dough into small circles, a little bigger than a quarter.  Fill the dough with meat. Put about a half of a tablespoon on top of each dough circle. Shape the dough with meat into small dumplings  Preparing the Yogurt Stew Pour 6 cups of water and 1 lb of Laban in a pot.  Mix well until all laban is dissolved.  Place on stove over medium-low heat and keep on stirring gently until it reaches a boil, at which time you turn the heat to low.  Crush 2 cloves of garlic in a blender then add to small pan.  Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil to the cloves of garlic and turn the stove on low/medium heat.  Cook the cloves of garlic until golden brown.  Stir in the cloves of garlic to the stew.  Stir in the dried mint powder. Add the desired amount to taste. Add the salt (to taste).  Cooking the Dumplings Add the Shish Barak dumplings one by one to the mixture while stirring frequently. This is to avoid the dough sticking to the sides or bottom of the mixture. Bring the stew to a boil again and then stir gently on low heat for 15-20 minutes until the shish barak dumplings are cooked. ",
