You can buy a disinfectant cleaner at a local grocery store or hardware store. If possible, ask a worker for a disinfectant specifically designed to treat water damage. Scrub down your walls and floors with a disinfectant. Read the directions of the disinfectant you purchase. Different disinfectants will need to be diluted with different levels of water. You can also make a solution at home using a combination of bleach and water. It depends on the type of bleach you're using, but half a cup of bleach per gallon of water is usually a safe ratio."

This can speed up the drying process. You should also place a dehumidifier in the room if you have one. If you don't have a dehumidifier, consider renting one, purchasing one, or borrowing one from a friend. They can really speed up the drying process. The same goes for industrial air movers opposed to regular fans."
