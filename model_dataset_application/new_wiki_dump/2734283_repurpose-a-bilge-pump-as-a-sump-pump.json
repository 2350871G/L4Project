      "description":"There are arguments for both approaches -- two pipes are better than one in terms of flow capacity, but adding a second pipe may be a more-difficult plumbing job. If using the existing pipe, you will need to cut it and install a check valve and T-connector. The check valve goes below the T-connector between the T and the existing sump pump. Make sure the flow direction for the check valve is correct! A second check valve will be installed between the side of the T-connector and the new bilge pump. If installing a new bilge pump outflow pipe, run that to the same place that your current sump outflow exits. For such a long run, you should use electrical ties to keep the pipe from sagging when full of water."
