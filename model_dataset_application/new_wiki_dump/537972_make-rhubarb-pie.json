  "text":" Preparing the Filling Chop the fresh rhubarb into one-inch pieces, stopping about an inch from the leaves on top. The leaves of the rhubarb plant are actually toxic, so dispose of the quickly. To be extra safe, stop cutting about an inch from the leaves to ensure you have the best, most tender rhubarb. Combine all remaining ingredients in a mixing bowl and toss to coat. Pie fillings are surprisingly simple, as sugar and salts help draw out moisture to create the gooey liquid and tender rhubarb that you're hoping for. Refrigerate the mixture for 20-30 minutes. This helps the flavors blend and meld and the water to slowly suction out of the rhubarb, softening it. For variations, add a bit more flavor with spices and extracts. Want a little twist on your rhubarb pie? The following ingredients can all be mixed in for a nice subtle twist:\n1/4 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon lemon juice\n1/4 teaspoon ground cloves\n1 whisked egg (makes a richer, thicker filling) Cut the rhubarb into 1\" pieces, discarding the leaves. The leaves of rhubarb are toxic, so stop cutting roughly and inch below the leaves for the best results. De-stem the strawberries, rinse, and cut them into slightly larger chunks than the rhubarb. The strawberries are a little more delicate than the rhubarb, meaning they will cook more quickly if they are the same size. Don't worry if a few of them are too small -- you just want the strawberries to be a bit bigger on average. Rinse all of the fruit and combine with the remaining ingredients. The lemon, sugar, salt, flour/tapioca/cornstarch, cinnamon, etc. all goes into the same bowl the fruit filling. Chill the filling for 20-30 minutes before using. You'll notice there is a little liquid at the bottom of the bowl that has been drawn out of the fruit -- this is a good thing! As the fruit chills, you can start preparing your pie tin to build the final dish. Homemade Crusts Cut the butter into small cubes and freeze for 10 minutes. The butter must stay solid for the crust to come together properly, so get it as cold as possible so that you can work it without worrying about it melting under your fingers. This is also why you need ice water later in the recipe. Combine the flour, salt, and butter in a food processor and pulse until crumb-like. There should be a mixture a bit like wet sand, with small pebbles of butter coated in the sugar and flour. It won't take long -- only 15-20 seconds of pulsing. Keeping everything in the processor, slowly add the ice water. Add it one tablespoon at a time, pulsing each one in. Your goal is to get a moist, almost formed dough -- not sandy, but not smooth like batter, either. This usually happens after 6-8 tablespoons of ice water, depending on the humidity where you live. Drier climates tend to need more water. Split the dough into two even balls and wrap individually in plastic. Turn the dough out on the counter and cut in in half. Then gently mold the dough into two evenly sized balls. Wrap them each up completely in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before using. This allows the butter to chill again, but also lets the flour \"relax,\" leading to a better final consistency. Know that you still need one traditional pie crust for a crumb-topped pie. You can make your own or buy one from the store. Crumb topping, as the name implies, is only to replace a classic crust on top of the pie. Crumb topping is sweet, lightly spiced, and rich complement to your pie, especially if you made a straight rhubarb pie (which could use the added sweetness). Cut 6 tablespoons of butter into small cubes and freeze for 10 minutes. Cold butter is easier to work with, and it will form the \"crumbs\" that your sugar and flour stick to. You only need 1/2\" cubes, anything smaller is hard to work with. In a medium bowl, toss the flour, sugars, and salt together. Use a fork or a small whisk to break up any clumps and make sure everything is well mixed. Add the cubed butter and, using your hands, mix until it all reassembles wet sand. You still want some 1/4\" clumps of butter, but the majority of the mixture should look like loose, damp dirt. There should be big moist clumps and very little \"powder\" left in the mixture. Alternatively, pulse the mixture in a food processor for 30-60 seconds. Baking Your Pie Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF. The pie actually cooks at 375\u00baF, so the oven needs to be turned down once it goes in the oven. However, this moment of opening the oven and putting in a cold pie quickly sucks heat away, meaning the pie starts closer to 375\u00baF if you actually start the oven at 400\u00ba. Roll out the dough ball on a floured piece of parchment paper until it is a circle about 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter. If the dough sticks to the rolling pin, sprinkle a little flour on this as well. Using the parchment paper, drape the dough over the rolling pin. It is almost impossible to pick up and place a piece of thin pie dough without ripping it. However, by \"wrapping\" it around the rolling pin you can slowly unroll it over the pie tin, placing it perfectly every time. Ease into a pie tin, then remove excess dough around the rim with a knife, Simply unroll the crust off of your rolling pin and into your pie tin. When done, use a knife of clean kitchen shears to cut the dough until you only have 1\" overhanging. Though not necessary, you can use the tines of a fork to press the edge of the crust into the rim of the pan, making decorative ridges on the edge. Pour your chilled filling into the mixture into the pie crust. It doesn't matter which one you made, they both cook at the same speed and rate. Spread the filling evenly in the dish with a fork. Top the pie with your crumb topping or roll out another dough ball into an identical sheet. If you used the crumb topping, simply spread it evenly over the entire pie. If you want a traditional crust, simply roll it out just like you did the bottom, lay it over the top and press in the edges, then cut away any excess.
