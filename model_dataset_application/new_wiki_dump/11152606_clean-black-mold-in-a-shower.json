          "description":"Choose gloves that won't let the mold through, such as rubber cleaning gloves or latex gloves. Don't touch the mold with your hands. Similarly, goggles are a good idea, as you don't want to flip mold spores into your eyes accidentally. You may also want to wear a dust mask that filters out mold. These precautions will also protect you from the bleach."

          "description":"Measure out the water first, and then pour the bleach into the water. Use a spoon or a paint stick to stir it together so it is is well mixed. Try not to splash it as you're stirring. Make sure you never mix bleach with ammonia, as it creates toxic gases. If you prefer, you can start out with an antifungal cleaning solution that doesn't contain ammonia, then follow up with bleach after you get most of the mold off.

Bridgett Price\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Co-Owner, Maid Easy\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: If you need to clean black mold around the caulking of your tub or around your shower head, you can kill it with a mixture of water and bleach, or you can use hydrogen peroxide or baking soda and water. However, if the mold covers an area larger than about half a bathroom rug, call a professional in to clean the mold, because it could be a sign of a bigger problem."

You can also rinse out the cloth in running water before dipping it back in the solution so you're not returning as much mold to your cleaning solution."

Spritz the stains left behind, and let it sit for 15 minutes or so. Once you've left it alone, run over it with a clean scrubbing brush.

Today's smart thermostats often have a way to change the humidity, at least in the summer. In the winter, it shouldn't be much of an issue."
