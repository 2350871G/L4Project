It may be marked with a small battery-shaped symbol, or you may see a plus or minus sign, indicating the polarity of the battery. These markings may be on the top or just to the side of the compartment door."

Look for lines in the case that don\u2019t match the other seam. You might also see a clasp or a lever that will release the compartment door. The battery compartment may also be held shut by one or more small screws."

If you don\u2019t have the manual, you may be able to find one by searching for your device online. If you\u2019re looking online, make sure to include the brand name and model number, if you know it."

To remove these screws, use a Phillips-head screwdriver with a cross-shaped tip. If the screw is stuck, you may be able to remove it using a screw extractor. In the case of a watch battery, you may need to use a special tool to remove the back of the watch."

If it\u2019s not listed, you might have to estimate the size of the battery, or try different sizes until you find the one that fits. AAA, AA, C, and D batteries are all 1.5V batteries, but the different sizes produce different currents, or the amount of power that comes out of the battery at once. AAA is the smallest traditional 1.5V battery, and is usually used to power small electronics. D is the largest 1.5V battery and usually charges larger items like flashlights. A 9V battery looks like a small box with snaps on top, and it's often used to power devices like smoke detectors and walkie-talkies. Coin and button batteries are small and round, and they're used to power very small devices like watches, hearing aids, and computer components."
