Wash and dry and clothes you plan to donate. Many donation centers and thrift stores cannot accept dirty or wet clothes as they can be a safety hazard. Separate clothes into similar groupings: put shirts with shirts, shoes with shoes, and pants with pants to make it easier for the people who will sort them.Tip: It\u2019s okay if you have outdated or older clothes to donate! Older clothes, especially business clothes like suits and ties, can really help someone looking for a job or preparing for an interview."
