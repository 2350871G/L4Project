More cheese makes for a messier sandwich, but you can add as much as you want - it's a matter of personal preference. You can also add shredded cheese on top of the sliced cheese, as this will make for a different flavor and texture, and the shredded cheese will melt more quickly than sliced cheese. If you want to add any other toppings (tomatoes, ham or turkey, vegetables, etc. ), do so now."
