Use a meat cleaver to pound the steak so it's a little thinner and more tender. You could also take a sharp knife and carefully poke the surface off the steak to tenderize it. Spread 1 teaspoon of olive oil evenly over the steak. While you can leave your steak out to come to room temperature before cooking, doing so doesn't actually improve browning or the flavor of the steak."
