Dig up the plant carefully to preserve the roots. To prepare for coffee, wash the roots until all the dirt is off. Dry the whole root on a towel in the sun. The chicory plant flowers from July to October. The flowers only open on sunny days. The roots, however, are best to pick between fall and spring.

You may want to stretch your coffee supply so that it lasts a bit longer. Try a 1:4 or 1:5 ratio of chicory to coffee. If you are trying to seriously reduce your coffee consumption, try a 1:2 or a 2:3 ratio of chicory to coffee. Consider drinking a mostly-chicory blend.
