You can find this type of beginner telescope for between 50 and 100 US dollars, depending on quality. More powerful telescopes that are still great for beginners can cost upwards of 300 to 400 US dollars, but provide better imaging. Some even interface with a tablet or smartphone, allowing you to easily track the sky using your mobile device."

          "description":"If you don\u2019t have a telescope but do own a good pair of binoculars, you can use them to see Jupiter\u2019s moons. You\u2019ll need a pair with a minimum of 7x magnification, or 7 times more powerful than human vision. While they\u2019ll only be visible as tiny dots, you should be able to make out the moons clearly. A good pair of modern binoculars is about as powerful as the telescope Galileo used when he first discovered Jupiter\u2019s 4 large moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto."

SkySafari and Google Sky Map both allow you to search for your stellar object and help you locate it in your patch of sky. JupiterMoons for iOS lets you find Jupiter\u2019s location in the sky and current appearance."

Sticking to the same observation time will ensure the accuracy of your results. Make sure you have time to set aside to make your observations, and hopefully the weather will cooperate with your experiment. Unless you live in a dense urban environment, you will most likely be able to observe Jupiter without having to go to a dark, isolated location. Your backyard should work just fine! While tracking the moons over the course of nine days is best, you can also make several observations over the course of 6 hours to track minor changes in their orbits and Jupiter\u2019s shifting position in the night sky."

For example, if Jupiter appears near the western horizon in the evening, it\u2019s too close to the setting sun to be observable.

Focus on the planet and center it in the eyepiece. You should be able to see from 1 to 4 moons, all of which should be in a straight line. Some of the moons may be behind Jupiter or so close to each other that they appear to be a single object."

Proceed to make Jupiter dots for as many days as you\u2019ll be making observations, and label each area with a date or day of the week. Once you\u2019ve drawn your Jupiter dots, go to the first one and plot the moons relative to the vertical line. For example, graph the moon that\u2019s closest to Jupiter 1 line to the left or right of the Jupiter dot, depending on what you observe. Graph the next closest moon 2 lines away from the dot, and so on. To find out which moon is which, cross check them with your Jupiter mobile app and color code them using colored pencils."

Each dot you drew will help you make your graph for that day, so on the second day of your observations, plot the moons relative to the second Jupiter dot. Be sure to continue to use your labeling or color coding system to keep track of each moon. If you cannot observe on a certain day, skip the graph for that day."
