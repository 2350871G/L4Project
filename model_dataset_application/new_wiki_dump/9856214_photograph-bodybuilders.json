The contrasting lighting adds shadows to the bodybuilder\u2019s muscles, and this effect is also known as \u201cbathroom lighting.\u201d\nTo help you angle the light, you can use a ladder or step stool. Downward light will cast shadows on the different muscles, showing depth and detail of the bodybuilder\u2019s hard work."

This provides more light to illuminate the sides of your model. These lights also help create separation between the bodybuilder and the background."

You can have a friend hold a reflector close to the bodybuilder\u2019s face, or you can set 1 on the floor, propped with a chair. Just make sure you can crop the reflector out of the photograph if it is visible. Use the gold side of the reflector if you want to add warmth to your pictures, or use the white side to add some brightness to dark areas. You can use a reflector 24 inches (0.61 m) or larger for best results."

If you are using a fast lens, set the F-stop 1 or 2 settings below the maximum aperture size (the total number of F-stops will be different for each particular lens). For other lenses, try using the maximum aperture. If your image is too bright after adjusting your aperture, try going an F-stop or 2 lower."
