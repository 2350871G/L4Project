Then remove each side\u2019s door knob by pulling them away from the door. You may also need to use a wire tool or a paper clip. If your knob or lock has no screws on it, insert a paperclip into the small hole on the side of the doorknob. This should release the knob latch and will allow you to pull off the knob."

Check your current lock\u2019s brand, and purchase a lock that matches it and fits the hole\u2019s dimensions. You can find a new lock that meets the measurements you took at a home improvement store, locksmith, or online. If you buy the same brand, your new lock will match your other locks, and you will most likely be able to install it using the existing holes."
