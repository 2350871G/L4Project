Knowing exactly when the dough is ready takes some experience, but trust yourself. As long as you keep the adjustments small, a tablespoon or less at a time, you'll be fine.

It is a very dense dough, so you'll want it about waist height so you can put your body weight into the dough. For a refresher on kneading:\nFold about 1/3 of the dough ball on top of itself.

Instead, pull up an inch of dough from the outside of the dough and fold it into the center of the dough.
