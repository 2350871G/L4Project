          "description":"To get rid of the first layer of dirt quickly, use a vacuum or mop to collect the excess dust and debris. For trickier dirt spots, dampen the mop with water and wipe up the dirt, making sure the mop isn\u2019t too wet so it doesn't cause water damage. Using a soft-bristled broom to sweep up any dust or dirt is also okay."

Look for a product that's labeled as safe on bamboo and that doesn't contain ingredients like ammonia or vinegar\u2014these can cause damage due to their acidity. A cleaner labeled as a \"hardwood floor\" cleaner works well on bamboo. Acids can harm the floor's top coat over time."

Move the microfiber mop along the surface of the floor, using light pressure to mop to be sure you remove all of the lingering dirt. By rubbing the bamboo floor cleaner into the floor, you'll create a beautiful shine. Pay attention to the corners of rooms and any other crevices to make sure the whole floor shines. Avoid using a steam mop, as this can damage and warp the bamboo floor. Use a bamboo floor cleaner on your floors once a week or every other week, depending on how dirty they get."

This is important because leaving even a little bit of water on your bamboo floor can lead to damage and warping. Use a soft, clean microfiber towel to dry the floor so you don\u2019t scratch it."

As you push the sander, you'll notice the sanded area change color, showing you which areas you've already done. Rent a disc floor sander from your local hardware store and tell them that you\u2019ll be sanding bamboo floors so they can provide you with the correct grit of sandpaper.

Keep the window open as you're working so the area is well ventilated. Feel free to use a smaller paint brush to apply the polyurethane to the edges of the floor if you're worried about the roller getting polyurethane on the baseboards or walls. Starting in the corner opposite from the exit is important so you won\u2019t have to walk over your fresh coat of polyurethane to leave the room.

Sand the floor again using the floor sander, making sure you don\u2019t press too hard and remove the entire fresh layer. Repeat the sealing process using the roller and let this next coat dry completely. Use the same 'W' shape movements when applying the polyurethane, working your way from one side of the room to the other. Read the can of polyurethane for specific information about how long the polyurethane takes to dry. Consider applying 3-4 coats of polyurethane to the bamboo floor for extra protection.
