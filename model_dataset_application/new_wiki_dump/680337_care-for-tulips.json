The warmer your climate, the later they should be planted. The soil should be below 60\u00b0F (15\u00b0C). You can keep tulip bulbs in your refrigerator (or some other cool, dry location) for about 2 months before planting season if you buy them in summer. However, do not store them next to apples, as they give off ethylene, destroying the bulb. Most bulbs need 12-14 weeks of a \"cold period\" to bring about beautiful bulbs come spring. Do not buy bulbs after December 1st unless they've been \"pre-cooled.\""

Tulips want sun, but they also want cool soil \u2013 don't give them sun that'll scorch them. If you're farther north, sun all day may be fine (the soil will be naturally cool enough). But if you live further south where it's hotter, shade in the afternoon will be better to keep the soil cooler."

If you have rodents or animals in your garden that you're worried about, you may need to erect a cage or fence around the bulbs. You may also consider putting thorny leaves or gravel in with the soil to deter pests. Use a 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) layer of mulch, leaves, or wood chips to protect the bulbs, control weeds and retain moisture. If you're planting perennials, you'll need to feed them every year to start them going again. You can use organic material, compost, or a balanced time-release bulb food every fall to start the process going."

          "description":"Fertilize your tulips once at the beginning of Fall and once in the beginning of spring for continuous growth. A balanced liquid fertilizer works well about three to four weeks after planting. This is especially important for perennials. Sprinkle or pour about one tablespoon of flower or plant fertilizer around each tulip bulb. This will last them for their entire \"hibernation\" period in the winter. Tulips are great at storing nutrients for long periods of time. Did you forget to fertilize in the fall? You can use a fast-release nitrogen fertilizer on developing leaves. Tulips are pretty easy in the scheme of things. If you're dealing with annuals, they may not need fertilizer at all. In the right climate, you can plant your tulip and essentially forget about it, no watering or fertilization necessary."
