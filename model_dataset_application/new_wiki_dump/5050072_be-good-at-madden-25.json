      "headline":"Identify the specialty of your team.",
      "description":"Knowing whether your team specializes in defensive or offensive plays is one of the basic information you need to know before playing the game. If defense is your team\u2019s strength, focus on interceptive plays and tackles. If your game is mainly offensive, take advantage of the skills and stats of your quarterback, switching between passing and running plays. All the details of your team can be seen on the team stats section accessible from the main menu."

      "headline":"Create a great defense.",
      "description":"Remember what they said about great defense being the best offense? Well, this applies to football too. Check the stats of a player to know their ratings and assign strong players on the defensive line. A great defense will stop the opposite team from scoring a touchdown, which in turn gives you a better chance on scoring one yourself."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Make the right calls.",
      "description":"While playing the game, don\u2019t just randomly choose a play. Choosing the right strategy, especially during crucial events like when there\u2019s not enough time left, is very important and can be the deciding factor whether you\u2019ll win the game or not. You can select the appropriate strategy to use from the Playbook section of the game."

    {
      "headline":"Use the turbo only when you have to.",
      "description":"Turbo lets your runner speed up for a short amount of time. But don\u2019t just press the turbo! Use it in a timely manner to get past tight defenses, avoid tacklers, and leave behind other running backs or players chasing you. Remember also that constantly using turbo drains the energy of your player."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use your time outs wisely.",
      "description":"As per the American Football rule, each team only gets three timeouts per half of the game. Use your timeouts conservatively, or if possible, save it until the later part of the game when your players\u2019 energies are already drained out."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Practice drills.",
      "description":"Drills let newbie players understand the basics, not only of the game, but also the rules of the American Football. Playing drills allows you to formulate your strategies before playing a real game. Achievement and trophies can also be unlocked when you play drill games. You can easily access Madden 25\u2019s drill section from the main menu."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use the stiff arm when needed.",
      "description":"A stiff arm is a technique where the player holding the ball extends his arm to parry opposing team\u2019s defending players. It\u2019s a great way to ward off tacklers. Press the X or A button on your controller (depending on the console you\u2019re playing) to use a stiff arm."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Trick your opponents.",
      "description":"Sometimes, you don\u2019t have to force your way against defenders. When a huge wave of line defenders are standing in your way, ramming your player against this wall is not the best idea. Instead, you can try to use spin moves or jukes to trick or evade opponents crossing your path."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Time your moves and ball passes.",
      "description":"Timing is everything. Executing your moves at the right moment, whether it\u2019s offensive or defensive, can do wonders. Running across the playing field can be just a walk in the park using perfectly timed spin moves and jumps. Anticipating the running or passing path of the opponent carrying the ball can lead to a great tackle or steal."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Practice makes perfect.",
      "description":"Even the most skilled Madden 25 gamer didn\u2019t instantly become good at the game. Pro-football players may even find it hard to master the game. Keep on practicing and you\u2019ll eventually be good at Madden 25."
