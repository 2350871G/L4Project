          "description":"Most vodka aficionados believe that drinking vodka in its pure form is the proper way to enjoy this beverage. Vodka is commonly made by fermenting either grains or vegetables. Grain-based vodka tends to taste smooth, even fruity while vegetable-based vodka can taste harsh or medicinal. According to some vodka enthusiasts, a good vodka will taste creamy and smooth. It will smell grainy and have a thick texture when frozen. A bad vodka will be harsh, bitter tasting, watery, and smell like medicine. If vodka burns your palate, it is most likely lower quality. If you have trouble picking a vodka, opt for a popular brand. Most people prefer the taste of Grey Goose, Absolut, Smirnoff, Titos, Ketel One, or Stolichnaya. If pure vodka is too aggressive a taste for you, opt for a flavored vodka like green apple or vanilla. The added sugar content may make the drink more palatable."
