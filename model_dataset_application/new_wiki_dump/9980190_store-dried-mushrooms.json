These packets contain iron powder which absorbs most of the oxygen out of the packaging they are in, which can keep food items from spoiling for a longer portion of time. Oxygen absorbing packets are not totally necessary to store with mushrooms, but aren\u2019t a bad idea, particularly if you are storing the mushrooms at room temperature in a kitchen cabinet."
