  "text":" Making the Pastry Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0C (375\u00b0).  Sift the flour and salt together into a bowl. You need to hold the sieve about 15cm (6 inches) from the bowl to allow the flour to become aerated. Don't hold the sieve too high as you'll lose a fair bit of flour and make a mess. Add the paprika and thyme to the flour and mix lightly using either your hands or a whisk. If you don't want to add any spice to the pastry, omit this step. If you're making this for your kids, only put in the spices if you know that they're okay with it. Put the margarine into the bowl and rub it in until it is completely combined. You can use butter but make sure you dice it and it's at room temperature. Pour in the water and stir to form a dough. Ensure that everything is incorporated. You may need to use a spatula (or something else) to scrape down flour from the side of the bowl. Flour the surface of a reasonable sized work area. This is to stop the pastry dough from sticking to the surface. Take out the dough and roll it out on the floured surface. You need to roll it out big enough so it can be lined in an 18cm (7inch) loose-based flan tin. Take note that the pastry will be fairly thin. Line the rolled out dough into the 18cm (7inch) loose-based flan tin. If the dough isn't big enough, roll it out thinner. If there is too much dough, just cut off the excess dough using a plastic knife. Use a fork to prick the base of the dough. This is to stop the pastry from puffing up. Line the dough with some baking paper paper and fill with baking beans. If you don't have any baking beans, some dry rice will do the job. Bake the pastry in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.  Remove the paper and beans from the tin and put the pastry back into the oven for 5 more minutes. Once done, set the tin aside and move onto making the filling. Making the Filling Grate the cheese. Set the cheese aside as you'll need it later. You might want to put the cheese in the fridge so it stays fresh and doesn't start to melt (if it's a hot day). Bring a large saucepan with lightly salted water to the boil and add the cauliflower, broccoli and onion wedges.  Allow this to cook for 10 to 12 minutes until the vegetables are tender. At 10 minutes, check the vegetables and decide whether they are done or not. Your stove may determine the cooking time so watch it carefully. Drain the water and set the vegetables aside.  Melt the butter or margarine in a saucepan. Make sure it's completely melted. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute while stirring constantly. You need to keep stirring to ensure that nothing becomes burnt. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the stock and milk. Stir so everything is completely combined before returning to the heat. Return the saucepan to the heat.  Bring the sauce to the boil, stirring constantly and add 55g (2 oz) of the grated cheese. Don't stop stirring otherwise something may burn. Add salt and pepper to taste. Put the cauliflower, broccoli and onion into the pastry case and pour over the sauce.  Sprinkle the remaining grated cheese on top and put the tart back into the oven for 10 minutes. Watch carefully at the cheese. The tart will be ready when the cheese becomes golden and bubbles \u2014 take it out when this happens. Garnish the tart with paprika (optional) and serve immediately. Enjoy!",
