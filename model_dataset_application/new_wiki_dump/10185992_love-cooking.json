Think about what you'd like to make whether it be sweet or savoury, and research a recipe to make it. Nowadays the Internet is full to the brim with recipes for most dishes and meals. Search the BBC Recipes archive (https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes), Allrecipes.com (https://www.allrecipes.com/), or the Jamie Oliver website (https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/category/course/) for a great selection.

You may find yourself confused as to what specific words like 'whip' or 'score' actually mean. If you find a word you don't understand, just look it up online or refer to a handy terminology database. Common cooking terminology could be 'simmer' (to cook a food just below boiling point), 'sear' (to brown a meat with high heat to seal in juices), 'garnish' (to add visual appeal to the final dish), 'whip' (to beat a food lightly folding air into the mixture), or 'score' (to cut shallow slits on the surface of a food)."

Fresh ingredients make all the difference in cooking and the flavor difference between a frozen product and a fresh product is startling. If a local farmer's market is situated nearby, check it out. They'll often have a wide variety of meats, fruits, vegetables, and many other foods that you can bring back to the kitchen."

Try to find 1 recipe each that would be suitable for breakfast, lunch, dinner, a snack, and a desert. These 5 recipes will be more than enough to get started. For example, make blueberry pancakes for breakfast, paninis for lunch, an Indian curry for dinner, some cookies for a delicious snack, and a decadent cherry pie for dessert."

A mistake in the kitchen is the best way to learn a valuable lesson, so don't be afraid that your dish won't be identical to what is in the cookbook. Quite often, something that looks difficult can actually be pretty simple when broken down into basic steps."

After a while, the process of cooking itself can be relaxing. If you you're too busy to set aside the time, try and find some recipes with low-preparation time to cook instead.
