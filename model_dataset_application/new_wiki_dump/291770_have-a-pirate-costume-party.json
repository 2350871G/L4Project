      "description":"If you send them too early, a lot of people will forget, send them too late, and they may have already agreed to be elsewhere. It is important that you do specify on the invitation, that it is a pirate party and you must be appropriately dressed to be allowed in! If you give your guests the chance, a lot will choose not to join in with the dressing up. Now, you can be as strict as you want to be about the dress code. You must remember that not everyone does like to dress up, so maybe you'll let them in wearing a pirate hat and eye patch, it is really up to you. To keep in the theme, you can always state on the invitation that if they do not dress up they will have to walk the plank, or some other forfeit that fits with the theme."

      "headline":"Give your guests a list of suitable costumes.",
      "description":"You need to make sure that you give a variety of ideas so that the people who are less keen can choose a more simple costume. Some examples of ladies costumes:\nPirate Wench Ladies can wear a peasant style dress, or blouse and a long skirt. There are many versions that also have a lace up bodice and bandana. Although there are sexy, short versions on the market, there are also longer styles available. Elizabeth Swann A character from Pirates of The Caribbean and governed by the Disney licensing laws. Elizabeth's costume changes many times throughout the three films. She wears Georgian dresses, long, off white shift dress and full shirt, long waistcoat and pantaloons when she is pretending to be a male crewman. Pirate Crew These costumes tend to be similar to the men with a stripped top, pantaloons or skirt, sash tied at the waist and a bandana or hat. Mary Read Mary Read was born in 1685 in England and was only 1 of 2 known women pirates. Ladies on board ship were considered to be unlucky and Mary had to dress as a man. Anne Bonny Anne Bonny is probably the most famous female pirate. She was a ruthless plunderer, raider, and menace to the seafaring vessels in the Caribbean Sea. She is commonly referred to as \"Toothless Annie\". Although she dressed and fought as a man, she was soon discovered and instead of bowing down to the pressure from the crew, she killed all who opposed her. Not a lady to have a row with! Some examples of male costumes & characters:\n Captain Hook From Peter Pan. There have been a few interpretations of the villain Captain Hook. The character has starred in Disney's cartoon version of Peter Pan and in many films, including the film 'Hook' where he was played by Dustin Hoffman. Typically a long frock coat is worn with pantaloons and a frilly shirt. He wears long, black boots and a large hat. A long, curly wig, moustache and a hook finish off the costume. Captain Jack Sparrow - From Pirates Of The Caribbean. This is a Disney production and therefore has strict licensing laws attached to it. A costume, unless licensed cannot be called Captain Jack Sparrow and you will probably see similar looking costumes called Pirate Captain etc. Typically a long, distressed frock coat or waistcoat is worn with a full shirt. Trousers are tucked into boots and he wears a bandana or a 3 pointed hat. Dark eyes and a goatee type beard finish off the costume. Pirate Crew  In most pirate films, the crew will play a part. They are normally dressed in stripped tops, cut away trousers, sashes tied around the waist and a bandana. They can be men or women. Blackbeard Blackbeard's real name was Edward Teach. He was a ruthless pirate who was named after his long, black beard. Long John Silver From Treasure Island. Ruthless pirate looking for treasure hidden by his old crew mate Billy Bones. Apart from the normal pirate attire, a peg leg is also required."
