Add tequila, triple sec, lime juice, and sugar to a cocktail shaker. Give it a stir and let it sit for 30 seconds to help dissolve the sugar. How much triple sec you add, if any, will depend on your tastes. Try starting with a 1/2 cup of triple sec. Add ice and shake vigorously. Fill the shaker 2/3 to 3/4 full with ice, close the lid, and shake vigorously for at least 15 seconds. Pour the shaken mixture into your glass. Once the ingredients are well mixed, remove the lid from the shaker and pour the mixture into your chilled, salt-rimmed glass. Add beer to the glass. Add 1/2 to 3/4 a cup of beer to your glass. You may want to start with 1/2 a cup of beer and then give the drink a taste before you add more. Stir and taste. Stir the ingredients together and give the drink a taste. Adjust it to your liking and stir. At this point, you may want to add some carbonated water to the mixture to make it more fizzy. Add chipped ice to your drink, stir, and enjoy. Once you\u2019re happy with your drink's flavor, add some chipped ice, give it a stir, and enjoy! Choosing the Best Ingredients Know how to select a good tequila. Tequila is the best when it is 100% agave. Tequila that isn\u2019t 100% agave may contain corn syrup, sugar, and artificial flavors and colors. It should say 100% agave on the label. Know which triple sec you want. Regular triple secs range in alcohol content from 15% (30-proof) to 40% (80-proof). For a boozier margarita, choose a triple sec with a higher alcohol content such as Cointreau (40% alc/vol). Triple sec comes in a variety of brands \u2014 popular ones include Cura\u00e7ao, Grand Marnier (actually an orange-infused cognac), and Cointreau. For a simpler margarita recipe you can skip the triple sec all together. Choose the perfect limes. Ripe limes have thin, shiny, soft skin; when you rub them, they should be quite fragrant. For an authentic Mexican flavor, use key limes, which are more tart and bitter than the larger Persian limes. Alternatively, use fresh lemon juice (try sweet Meyer lemons!) for a softer taste. Use a high-quality sweetener. Common sweeteners for margaritas include agave nectar (if it\u2019s not available at your grocery store, check a health food store), simple syrup, and honey. You can make simple syrup at home by mixing water and sugar in a jar and shaking it, or by heating the sugar and water together in a pan \u2014 in both cases until the sugar dissolves. Depending on your tastes, you can mix 1.5 to 2 parts sugar with 1 part water. A sweetener isn\u2019t 100% necessary \u2014 some people use no sweeteners at all, instead letting the orange liqueur do the sweetening. Use big ice cubes. Unless you\u2019re making a blended margarita, use big ice cubes (i.e. when shaking one up in a cocktail maker). Big ice cubes won\u2019t melt as quickly as crushed ice or smaller cubes; the less the ice melts, the stronger and more flavorful your drink will be. Choose a high-quality salt to rim your glass with. Sea salt and kosher salt are the most commonly recommended types of salt for rimming your margarita glass. Kosher salt will make for a slightly saltier rim than sea salt. Avoid using table salt, which will create a fine-grained, clumpy rim on your glass, and make for an overly salty drink. You can also purchase pre-made salt mixes specifically for margaritas at grocery and liquor stores. Salting the Rim of Your Glass Pour salt into a small saucer. Recommended salts are kosher and sea salt, as the larger grains are more pleasing both to the taste buds and the eyes. Aim for a 1/4-inch thickness of salt. For a tasty savory-sweet salted rim, add some sugar to your salt mixture before salting the rim of your glass. Wet the rim of your glass. A popular way to do this for margaritas is to cut a slit into a lime wedge, place the lime on the glass as if to garnish it, and then run the lime around the glass\u2019s rim. Be careful not to squeeze the lime too hard as you move it around the glass\u2019s rim, otherwise its juice may drip down into the glass. If it does drip down, it\u2019s not the end of the world, it\u2019ll just look a bit messy. Salt the rim of your glass. There are two popular methods to salting the rim of your glass. One method is to simply place the mouth of your glass onto the saucer and give it a twist \u2014 as you would use a cookie cutter. The other method is to hold the rim of the glass parallel to the saucer and, letting it lightly touch the salt, turn the glass in your hand so that only the outer rim is covered in salt. This method ensures that the salt only ends up on the outside of the glass so that no additional salt winds up in your drink.",
