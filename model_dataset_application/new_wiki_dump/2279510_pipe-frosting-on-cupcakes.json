          "description":"Pastry bags typically come with a set of tips that you can switch out to make different designs with your frosting. Pick a tip that looks appealing to you. Common designs are circles, stars, dots, and other simple shapes, though more complicated tips are also available. Choose the smallest tip you can for the design you are trying to pipe. Smaller tips let the frosting come out more slowly and are easier to perform detail work with, making them best for intricate designs. Larger tips are fine for simple designs."

For these, thread the bottom end of the bag through the coupler. Next, screw the tip on to tighten and lock it in place. Some bags simply have a hole at the bottom. For these, set the tip point-down inside the pastry bag. Shift it around so that it sits at the hole in the bottom. Give it a gentle downward tug to pull it snugly into place. Some disposable bags allow you to push the tip through the plastic at the bottom."

The frosting should not run out of the bottom of the bag when loading it. If it does, it is too thin.

If you have frosting to spare, you can practice this motion on a plate before attempting to frost the actual cupcake."
