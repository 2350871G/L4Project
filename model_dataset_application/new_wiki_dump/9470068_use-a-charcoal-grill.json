A charcoal chimney is basically a metal cylinder with a grate at the bottom, holes in the side, and a handle on the side. You place the charcoal inside, light it efficiently and safely, then pour the briquettes in your grill when they're ready. Lighter fluid can be dangerous and is not necessary if you use a charcoal chimney."

This will give your food the most contact time with the smoke, helping it get the rich flavor you want. Use only food-grade wood chips. You can find these wherever grilling supplies are sold. Hickory, mesquite, and applewood are popular varieties of wood chips for grilling. Soaking the wood chips in plain water for 20 minutes before grilling helps them burn slower, increasing the flavor they give your food."
