Gluing Furniture\\/Indoor Projects Together Choose yellow carpenter\u2019s glue for indoor furniture projects. This is usually made of aliphatic resins and sold in squeeze bottles. Set your pieces of wood atop a worktable or surface. Make sure it is covered with something that is a little slippery so the wood doesn\u2019t get stuck to your table. Apply a bead of glue to one side of the joint that will be glued together. Then, brush it to the edges with a paintbrush. Place the wood pieces together firmly. Make sure they are aligned. Start clamping the wood pieces down first. Set cauls, or wood pieces, covered in packing tape on top of the wood pieces. Then, clamp them down with screw clamps. If possible do this on each side. Clamp the wood pieces toward each other with bar clamps. Alternate putting the clamps below the wood piece and above it to ensure an even adhesion.
