Either call or go directly to the office to ask them if they\u2019re able to check where the sewer lines are located. Most times, they\u2019ll be able to show you where the underground lines come from your home and extend to the main city line. Some zoning offices may not be able to locate the sewer lines on residential property. Learn the official property lines for your home so the zoning office doesn\u2019t give you any false information.Tip: If your area doesn\u2019t have a zoning office, check for a city maintenance department since they may be able to locate sewer lines for you."

Search online for your city\u2019s name with the phrase \u201cwater and sewer map\u201d to see if one is available online. Type in your address or locate your property on the map to see where the sewer lines run in your home. Smaller towns and cities may not have online maps for water and sewage.

Reach out to 811 and tell them your address so they know where to send utility workers. Within the next 2\u20133 days, professional utility companies will visit the area and mark the lines in your yard with either small flags or lines of paint.

If you\u2019re looking for a sewer line outside, look for a black or white pipe with a plastic cap along the outside of your home, which allows direct access to your home\u2019s main sewer line. Unwrap the detector line from the spool and push the end through the pipe so it extends out about 15 feet (4.6 m). Leave the line in place so you can find it with the wand. Avoid putting the line into your toilet since it won\u2019t work as well if it\u2019s submerged. Older homes may not have a sewer cleanout in their home. Contact a plumber to come to install one for you to make it easier to locate lines later on or break apart clogs.Tip: If the detector line stops or doesn\u2019t go the full 15 feet (4.6 m), then there may be a clog in the pipe."

As you follow the detector line, the wand will create a beeping signal that gets louder and higher when you get closer to the end of the line. When the wand creates the loudest and highest pitch, you\u2019re close to where the line ends. Try rotating the wand if you hear a weak signal since it could mean that you\u2019re nearby but facing the wrong direction.

Listen for the loudest and highest pitch again to get a better idea of where the sewer line is located. If the reading maxes out again, reduce the sensitivity by another 10-15% and try waving the wand over the area again. Repeat the process until it doesn\u2019t max out anymore.
