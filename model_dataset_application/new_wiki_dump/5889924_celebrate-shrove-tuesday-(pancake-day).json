You are basically set a given distance and you aim to become the first person to the finish flipping and catching your pancake in a frying pan all the way. These are very popular in the UK but you could find them in many other places internationally."

If you would like to give up protein for the whole forty days, that won't be good for your energy levels or your overall health. Some popular ideas are Facebook, caffeine, alcohol and chocolate."
