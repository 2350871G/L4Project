Remember, it's always possible to cut off, but not always possible to add back on. Measure each wall at least twice to get the most accurate measurements possible. When measuring outside corners, be sure to add additional room to your measurements to allow for outside corners. You'll want at least the width of your baseboard in extra room, possibly a bit more."

Some people use a 10% excess estimate, but usually just buying an extra stock length or two will do.

There are typically three components to most baseboard installations, depending on the type of project. Moving from top to bottom, they include:\nThe cap molding.

Use a 4-foot level to establish whether the floor is level. If the floor is not level, use the level to find the lowest point in the room. Tack a scrap piece of baseboard to the wall at the lowest point. Make horizontal marks every couple of inches in either direction starting at the top of the baseboard, being sure to stay level with this line. Once a few horizontal marks are established, snap a chalk line over the horizontal marks. This will show where the top of the baseboards will stand when they are installed."

Tack a piece of baseboard to an inside corner with one or two nails after leveling it. Keep the bottom of the baseboard slightly above the floor. Use a compass to measure the distance between the chalk line (on the bottom) and the top corner of your tacked baseboard. Keeping your compass spread rigid, hold the point-side of the compass on the floor and the pencil-side on the baseboard. Move the pencil across the entire distance of the baseboard to trace an outline. Use a table saw or a jigsaw to cut along the scribed line on the baseboard. If you have a circular saw, set a slight (2\u00b0 - 5\u00b0) bevel on the cut. This will make scribe-fitting much easier in the end. With a block plane, plane down the beveled edge of the baseboard. Then dry-fit the baseboard back onto the floor and make sure it lines up evenly with the chalk line on your wall."

          "description":"For inside corners, the process of mitering is the same as it is for outside corners, except that the angles are reversed. But not all carpenters want to miter inside corners, because the corners are rarely perfectly square and the resulting joint can be sloppy. If you're looking for a tighter fit or you're installing baseboards which won't take paint or additional caulking, learn how to cut a traditional coped joint. The process is actually fairly simple. Start with a 45\u00b0 inside cut on the baseboard you want to cope. The other end of the baseboard won't need to be cut at all; the coped joint will simply cover up the remaining piece of baseboard. Use a coping saw to cut away the angled profile made by your initial 45\u00b0 cut. The goal here is to leave the paint line intact but cut at a 45\u00b0 back angle to clear away wood behind the paint line. Go slowly so that you can follow the profile accurately. Sand away any excess rough patches or debris to smooth out the coped seam.Alternative tools:Miter saw: coping with a miter saw is fast but difficult. Practice on scrap wood first, and clean up the rough cut with a file.Dremel: a little more difficult to use than a coping saw, but up to the job. Use a carbide cutting or shaping wheel attachment."

Then, use that setting on your saw to cut your trim. Mid-wall pieces. It\u2019s likely that you will have to use more than one piece of baseboard to cover very long walls. Instead of simply butting flat ends up against one another, which may separate with time as the wood shrinks, cut both pieces at overlapping 45-degree angles (to fit together like so // ) so that the wood shrinkage will be less visible.
