This has resulted in many different versions of D&D being in circulation, with some versions considered superior to others. You and those you\u2019re playing with should all use a single version when making characters or playing a campaign. The calculations in provided in the following examples are based off Pathfinder, an extensive online available version of D&D that is compatible with D&D Version 3.5. Some versions may use different calculations. D&D 5th Edition\u2019s basic rules were released in 2014 and shortly followed by the Starter Set, an adventure module, the Player\u2019s Handbook, and more.

Important for rogues, light- to medium-armor wearing characters, and ranged attackers (like bow and sling users). Constitution (Cons). A measure of health and fortitude. Constitution increases your character\u2019s hit points, which if depleted, can result in fainting or death. Intelligence (Int). A measure of knowledge. Important for wizards and classes requiring reason or learning, like paladins. Wisdom (Wis). A measure of correct judgement. Wisdom contributes to common sense, awareness, and willpower. Important for clerics, druids, and rangers. Charisma (Cha). A measure of magnetism. High charisma improves likability, appearance, and leadership ability.

Use gold to buy the starting weapons, armor, items (potions, torches), and equipment (tents, rope) for your character. Lists of items, weapons, and armor can be found online. In some games, you may only have simple weapons or armor available until you find a suitable shop where you can buy better ones. Characters that are suited for the center of the action, like fighters and paladins, will likely need heavy armor, like plate mail and a shield, along with a weapon, like a broadsword or mace. Characters that are agility based, like gnomes, rogues, and rangers, are better suited to light armor, like chainmail or boiled leather, and distance or sneak attack weapons, like a bow, sling, or a Kukri knife. Frail characters, like many wizards and bards, may only be able to equip very light armor or robes. Weapons, too, are usually limited to light varieties, like rods, staves, bows, and whips. Fill in armor class and combat bonuses. Weapon and armor bonuses will be listed along with the weapon and armor information. In some cases, like with very heavy weapons/armor, there may also be penalties. A high armor class (AC) will make your character more resistant to damage. Attack bonuses help you land damaging hits. Use the following calculations to determine your AC and attack bonuses:\nAC = 10 + armor bonus + shield bonus + Dexterity Modifier + other modifiers (like racial or class)\nMelee attack bonus = base attack bonus + Strength Modifier + size modifier\nRanged attack bonus = base attack bonus + Dexterity Modifier + size modifier + range penalty (if any)\n\nSize modifiers are determined according to the following scale: Colossal (-8), Gargantuan (-4), Huge (-2), Large (-1), Medium (+0), Small (+1), Tiny (+2), Diminutive (+4), Fine (+8). Small characters are generally more agile, whereas large ones are generally strong. Finishing Your Character Paint a picture of your character. Feel free to do this in a drawing or with words. Include basic physical features like age, weight, height, skin color, and more. Think of your character\u2019s personality, which will influence the decisions they make in the game. Write a backstory for your character. What was their young life like? This will give you a better sense of the character as separate from yourself, which will help with role-playing later. Goals, fears, and desires can add depth to your character. Keep these in mind as you play your character and interact with other players and non-player characters (NPCs). Determine the alignment of your character. Alignment is a measure of moral attitude. There are nine basic alignments which encompass a range of personalities, philosophies, and beliefs. Alignment consists of one order characteristic (Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic) and one moral characteristic (Good, Neutral, Evil), as in lawful-neutral, lawful-evil, neutral-good, and chaotic-good. Good characters are driven to protect innocence and life. Good sacrifices for others and cares for the dignity of sentient creatures. Evil characters undermine or harm life. Evil hurts, harms, and oppresses, usually for fun or personal gain. Morally neutral characters avoid killing, but usually lack a sense of obligation to sacrifice for or protect others. Lawful characters respect order, truth, authority, and tradition. They are often closed-minded, overly rigid, and self-righteous. Chaotic characters make decisions according to their conscience. They resent authority and love freedom, though they can be reckless and irresponsible. Order neutral characters are generally honest, but susceptible to temptation. They feel neither a need to obey orders or rebel. Play your character in a campaign. Join other players so you can play your character in a campaign decided or created by your dungeon master. Sample campaigns and resources can be found online, but so long as you have access to a core rulebook, you can create your own D&D world. For those who are brand new to D&D, dungeon masters are the coordinators of the game. They describe setting, control non-player characters, and design dungeons for characters to overcome.",
