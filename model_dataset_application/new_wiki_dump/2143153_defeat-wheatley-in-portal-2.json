Due to Wheatley's poor aim, the bombs will go through the portal and hit him. Repeat the process over and over till all the cores are attached; except the core after the first one. Then you will put the portal under Wheatley instead."

When you are sent flying back into Wheatley's view, get your gun ready and shoot at the moon. Remember when in Chapter 7 - The Reunion, Cave Johnson talks about moon rocks being able too hold Portals - Moon + Portal = Tada! You just beat the game!"
