Removing burnt material from the grate will lessen the amount of debris and ash falling down onto your clean tubes. Use a steel wool pad or a wire brush to clean off your grates. Many grill tool kits even come with a brush and scraper. Use the scraper tip to help dislodge stubborn chunks."

If you find covers that are particularly charred, though, remove them and rinse them in a sink or bucket with dish soap and warm water after brushing. Submerge the covers in the soapy water and scrub with a steel wool pad or a scrubby sponge. Then rinse the covers with clean, running water and dry them with a towel."

If there is a lot of debris at the bottom, you may even want to use a shop vac to help you get it all out. Take this time to empty the drip pan on your grill, too.
