          "description":"Hang a line of medium-sized photos, paintings, or other art in identical frames along the wall for a symmetrical look. This would look good between two windows or two doors. As a rule of thumb, art should be hung at eye level, but not if the ceiling is low. A low ceiling height is considered 8 to 9 feet (2.4 to 2.7 m). If you\u2019re hanging a collection of art, hang it as though it were one piece, as opposed to individual pieces. Pinterest and home decor magazines can provide a lot of inspiration for arranging your wall art, especially if you want to create a gallery wall."

        {
          "headline":"Hang 1 large piece of art to create a focal point.",
          "description":"The center point should be at eye level. When hanging art above furniture, leave at least 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) of space between the top of the furniture and the bottom of the art. If you hang art above a sofa or another piece of furniture, its width shouldn\u2019t span more than 2/3 the width of the length of your sofa. If the art is larger than the piece of furniture, the furniture will look too small. If you\u2019re mounting above a fireplace, the art\u2019s width should fall between the length of the fireplace opening and the length of the mantelpiece."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Make a gallery arrangement for an artsy vibe.",
          "description":"Print your favorite photographs and hang them at different heights to make an art gallery look in your living room. When grouping 4 or more pieces 1 above the other, the art should be visually balanced on both sides of an imaginary vertical line. So too many larger frames on one side of the imaginary line will unbalance the arrangement. For instance, if there are only large frames on the right side of the arrangement, and only small frames on the left, it would look clumsy. Make sure the art is similar in color scheme, subject matter, or frame style. You should also coordinate the artwork with your living room\u2019s color scheme. You may change the art in your gallery wall over time to accommodate bigger, smaller, or different artwork without it becoming outdated or mismatched. It's okay for your gallery wall to start small and grow over time. Add more frames as you get more photos or art to hang."

You\u2019ll have more space for books, collections of music, and nick-knacks. Set up a desk as a workspace against the lower half of the wall. Painting a contrasting color on the back wall built-in shelves emphasizes the architecture by showcasing the shelving. Don\u2019t make the colors contrast too much, such as with black and white. For instance, opt for a green background wall color with white shelves. Built-in shelves can also be arranged around a TV to make a home entertainment system where speakers, video games, and their accessories can be on the shelves while the TV is at the center of the arrangement."

Hanging instruments on the wall keeps them clean and safe from harm. You can buy musical instrument wall mounts from any music supply store. For example, if you play string instruments, you can hang guitars, violins, or ukuleles by the neck using special wall mounts.

          "description":"Tapestries are renter friendly, and they come in many colors and designs, so you can find ones that have scenes on them or just patterns. You can hang a tapestry with a rod, pushpins, nails, a baseboard, or frame. Hang with pushpins in each of the corners, allowing the fabric to drape for a casual look. For a straighter look, hammer a row of nails across the top of the tapestry. Nails and pushpins work best on tightly woven, lightweight tapestries, because they\u2019re not as likely to damage the material as they are with polyester. You can hang a large tapestry over a wooden dial rod that is longer than the tapestry's width. Drape the tapestry over the rod, then tie each end of a decorative rope or cord on the exposed ends of the rod. Hang the rod, with the tapestry attached, on the wall using the rope or cord."

This will give you a neat, framed art look without taking up a lot of space on the wall, as opposed to if you just hung the tapestry freely. If the fabric is thin, you should stretch and staple canvas to the frame before attaching the tapestry, so the wood doesn\u2019t stick out. You can buy frames and plywood boards from craft stores."

Hang a canvas of art over the painted stripe, or let the stripe stand alone as wall d\u00e9cor."

There are different kinds of wallpaper to choose from, the most popular being embossed, vinyl, and textile based. Vinyl is the most popular kind of wallpaper. It\u2019s easy to clean, cheap, and durable. It only needs to be changed every 10 to 20 years. Embossed wallpaper has textured designs, so it\u2019s good for hiding imperfections in the wall. Textile wallpaper is made of different fabrics and is flame-retardant, stain resistant, and provides better insulation than other wallpapers. A simpler option is to use vinyl wall decals to add texture and decor to your walls. For example, you might choose a vinyl wall decal that looks like faux brick, faux wood, or faux shiplap."
