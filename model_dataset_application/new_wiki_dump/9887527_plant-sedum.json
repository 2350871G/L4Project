Some types of sedum, such as sedum ellacombianum, do require some protection from the sun or else they will completely dry out. Smaller types of sedum can be grown indoors in a pot without being transplanted outdoors. Avoid creeping sedums that are low to the ground."

          "description":"It doesn\u2019t matter if the soil is rocky or sandy as long as water can drain through it easily. Test the soil by digging a 12 in by 12 in (30 cm by 30 cm) hole and filling it with water. If it drains in 10 minutes, the soil is well-drained. Soil pH can be tested with a kit found at most gardening stores or online. If needed, you can adjust the pH of your soil by applying powdered limestone, or lime, if the soil is too acidic. You can also add aluminum sulfate if your soil is too basic. If your soil is not well-drained, you can add manure and compost to improve the water drainage."

Overwatered sedum will cause the leaves to rot. If the soil next to the sedum is dry to the touch, you should water. Sedum can stand up to harsh heat and droughts by using the water in its leaves."

You can plant cuttings from other sedum plants at any point during the growing season. Avoid planting sedum on overly hot summer days. Most sedums can survive the frosts of winter unprotected when left outside."

Propagating Sedum from Cuttings Cut sections with 3 or more leaves into 3 to 4-in (7.6 to 10 cm) pieces. Using pruning shears, cut off well-grown pieces at the stem.

Remove the sedum from its container by gently pulling the base of the stem and tipping the pot, so the plant and dirt slide out together. The depth of the hole should be the same depth as the pot you are transferring the sedum from. Place the sedum so the bulb is level with the soil. Fill in the remaining soil around the bulb, packing it in firmly. Water the sedum thoroughly as soon as you are finished with the soil. Add mulch, such as wood chips or gravel, around the sedum plant. This will reduce weeds while keeping the right temperature and moisture levels in the soil.
