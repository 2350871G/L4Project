Sweet Shrub requires little in the way of maintenance, but you may like to prune it to keep the plant in shape and prevent it from growing too wide. Pruning should be done immediately after flowering, which means in the early summer. Due to the fact that this plant spreads by producing side shoots known as suckers, you can control the width by pinching these off as they emerge. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9e\\/Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9e\\/Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\\/aid4863831-v4-728px-Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nThinning out old growth will usually ensure the new growth comes through more vigorously the following growing season. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/26\\/Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/26\\/Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\\/aid4863831-v4-728px-Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Water sweet shrub frequently until well-established. After you have planted Sweet Shrub, it's important to keep it watered until it is well-established, regardless of whether you planted it from seed, cuttings or nursery plant. Once established, Sweet Shrub is very tolerant of dry conditions. As a result, it will only need light watering during periods of drought, when you should water it once a week. Protect your Sweet Shrub from disease. Sweet Shrub doesn\u2019t tend to be bothered by disease but root rot can occur in poorly-drained soil. To avoid this, don\u2019t plant the bush where puddles form and don\u2019t easily drain away. If you observe warty growths on stems close to the ground, this may indicate bacterial crown gall. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f5\\/Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f5\\/Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\/aid4863831-v4-728px-Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nThe best solution is to remove the plant and surrounding soil to prevent re-infection. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9f\\/Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-11Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-11Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9f\\/Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-11Bullet2.jpg\\/aid4863831-v4-728px-Plant-a-Sweet-Shrub-Step-11Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Transplant Sweet Shrub in fall or winter. If you need to transplant Sweet Shrub, do it in fall or winter. Take cuttings in July if you wish to quickly reproduce from a parent plant. To reproduce a plant from suckers, take a rooted sucker and replant it until a proper root system is established before planting on. This is usually the fastest way to get a mature flowering plant. Harvest the seeds once they turn brown. Wait until the seed pods turn brown if you wish to harvest the Sweet Shrub seeds. Don\u2019t wait any longer though \u2013 the seeds are best planted mature but fresh. The seeds are best planted immediately. If this isn't possible, keep them for up to 3 months wrapped in moss inside a plastic bag in the refrigerator. Don't eat any part of the Sweet Shrub plant. Although it has been eaten as a spice in the past, Sweet Shrub is poisonous in large enough quantities, especially the seed. Don\u2019t confuse it will true Allspice, which is best purchased from the grocery store!",
