Some chefs find it easier to make a rectangular cake, and often decide to use bread pan instead of a typical round bowl. It's up to you:\nIf you're going to make a fresh cake base, make sure the bowl is roughly 1\" smaller in diameter than your cake pan. This ensures the ice cream fits on top of the cake with room for the meringue. Using a bread pan or other rectangular can make it easier to cut the cake to fit if you're using pre-baked cakes or brownies for the base."

  "text":" Preparing the Ice Cream Line a 3-quart bowl with plastic wrap, letting excess hang over the sides. This bowl will form you \"dome\" of ice cream, so use whatever bowl type you'd like. Some chefs find it easier to make a rectangular cake, and often decide to use bread pan instead of a typical round bowl. It's up to you:\nIf you're going to make a fresh cake base, make sure the bowl is roughly 1\" smaller in diameter than your cake pan. This ensures the ice cream fits on top of the cake with room for the meringue. Using a bread pan or other rectangular can make it easier to cut the cake to fit if you're using pre-baked cakes or brownies for the base. Pack your favorite ice creams into the bowl in layers. Simply scoop your desired ice cream flavors into the plastic-lined bowl. You can either spread the ice cream out in layers or simply leave it as scoops, what is most important is that you densely pack it as tightly into the bowl as you can. The flavors you use are totally up to you, and there are no wrong choices. Consider what type of cake you're using for the bottom to make a flavor combination that you love. Cover the top of the bowl with plastic wrap and press down. Remember to pack the ice cream densely so that there are no air pockets in the final cake. That said, you don't have to throw your entire body weight into it. Simply use plastic wrap to keep your hands clean and press lightly around the sides and edges. Freeze the ice cream bowl until frozen solid -- at least 3 hours. Many chefs will even do this overnight, making sure they'll have the ice cream solid enough and taking one thing off their list on baking day. Don't skimp on this time -- the ice cream has to be rock solid. Making a Meringue Separate four eggs and discard the yolks. Meringues are made out of egg whites and sugars, and the yolk will prevent the sorry of stiff binding you need for a solid meringue. Even if you don't have an egg separator, there are a few ways to remove the yolk from the white:\nCrack the egg in half, then transfer the yolk back and forth between the two shell halves. Do this over your mixing bowl, and the white should drip down as you toss the yolk back and forth. Crack the egg over a slotted spoon or funnel letting the white drip out. Crack the egg into your hands, holding the yolk and letting the white drip through. Add 1/4tsp cream of tartar and the eggs to a large metal mixing bowl. Cream of tartar helps the meringue keep its shape, allowing the eggs to solidify under the stress of mixing. Beat the egg whites on medium with a hand mixer until peaks form. This should only take a minute. \"Peaks\" are when you lift the mixer out and the egg mixture comes up with the beaters to form a little sagging point.

Further beating will make the mixture even more dry and stiff, and you need to be able to spread it! Building the Baked Alaska Preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. You want a very high temperature to quickly cook the meringue on the outside without the heat penetrating to the ice cream in the middle. The baking sheet with parchment paper will prevent sticking and messy cleanups later. Cut your cake or brownie to fit the bottom of the bowl.

The ice cream will likely need to warm up slightly in order to slide out of the bowl, but you want to act fast once the ice cream comes out of the freezer -- it should be as cold as possible when the cake goes in the oven. Press your cake or brownie into the bottom of the bowl. If you've cut a sheet cake into strips, place them down on the bottom of the ice cream so that there are no spaces. If you have a full round cake, center it on the ice cream, but don't worry about pressing it in just yet, especially if the edges overlap and you're worried the cake will split.
