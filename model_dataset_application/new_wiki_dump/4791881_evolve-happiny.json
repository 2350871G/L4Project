When your character walks on the correct square of floor (which is assigned at random), a message prompt with \u201cYour character has found an Oval Stone\" will appear. Below, find the locations in each game where you can find Oval Stones:\n\nDiamond/Pearl/Platinum: Lost Tower; the Underground; found on wild Happiny and Chansey\n\nHeart Gold/SoulSilver: Rock Tunnel; Bug Catching Contest (first prize); Amity Meadow; found on wild Chansey\n\nBlack/White: Challenger's Cave; Black City shop B; during Dust Clouds; found on wild Happiny\n\nBlack 2/White 2: Dust clouds inside the Relic Passage, Rebirth Mountain, and Clay Tunnel; White Forest\n\nX/Y: Unknown Dungeon (hidden on a rock to the left of Mewtwo); Pok\u00e9Mileage Club (balloon popping, level 2)\n\nOmega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire: Found on wild Happiny\n\nSun/Moon: Paniola Ranch; \"Path for Brilliant-Stone Hunting!\" mission of Isle Aphun in Pok\u00e9 Pelago (available starting at Rank 2)"
