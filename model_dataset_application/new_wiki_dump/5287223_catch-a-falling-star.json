If you want very accurate information, a World Clock Time Zone website will help so you can easily find the correct time. Here's a link to the WorldClockTimeServer website out of the many accurate time servers that exist. Check your local time against the World Clock to ensure your watch is set right so you can watch the star."

Please note that these are only two websites out of the very many in CyberSpace that you can use to get the same information, but for the purposes of this article, it should only be limited to one for the correct time and one to find the sunset and sunrise information."

      "description":"Go outside and look up, while panning your eyes across the top of the horizon. Can you physically see clouds or does it look gray or white? If so, this is not a good night to see or watch the stars without a strong telescope that can peer out past the clouds, such as the Hubble Telescope because the weather is too cloudy if it's not crystal clear. There are other space telescopes besides Hubble, but it's the most talked about space telescope at this time. Can you see stars twinkling in the beautiful night sky?"
