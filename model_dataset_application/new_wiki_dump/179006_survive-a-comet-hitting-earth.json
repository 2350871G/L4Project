As a result, there\u2019s a very good chance they will know if there is a large object about to collide with us. By listening to their predictions, you can develop a real sense of how much time you have to prepare. Check back with the NASA website, as they constantly update close calls. Make sure to prepare well in advance. Sometimes astronomers know about potential impacts on the earth only a couple months beforehand."

          "description":"Because the earth is made up of 71% water, there\u2019s a greater likelihood that the comet will hit a body of water. If this does happen, it could mean that giant tsunamis would be created by the initial impact and they would likely destroy our coastal cities. Additionally, there would be an increase in water vapor entering our atmosphere which would cause heavy rain, which could cause landslides and flooding. The tsunami in India in 2004 killed 150,000 people in a single day with many more left missing. The results of a tsunami from a large comet impact would be even worse. Even if you had an impenetrable bunker near the coast, massive flooding would mean you could never leave it."

          "description":"An underground bunker isn\u2019t only the best for the time of impact; it will also protect you from environmental hazards after the comet has hit. When the comet hits, dust, soot, and water will shoot up into our atmosphere, making it cold for months to years. For that reason, make sure you also outfit your bunker with an energy source for heat, like a generator and enough fuel to last while the dust in the atmosphere settles. If you're unable to get a bunker, make sure to fortify whatever structure you're going to be staying in so that it can withstand the blast. Buildings that have strong foundations and are lower to the ground are better. If you can't find a bunker, try to find another location that's going to be unaffected by the impact. This could be a cave or another natural structure that would shield you from the initial blast. There are many different bunker options available, but the best ones for a comet impact will have an air filtration system and be made of strong material. Bunkers can be expensive and range from anywhere from $20,000 to a million dollars and upwards."

Make sure that you have enough food that\u2019s able to stand the test of time. A radio, handheld transceiver or walkie-talkie, and flashlights are other important pieces of gear you should stock up on. Make sure to stock your hide-out with canned food, dried goods, non-perishable foods, and bottled water. If there is more than one person staying in your location, make sure that you increase the amount of food you are storing accordingly. The average calorie intake for men is 2,500 calories a day and 2,000 calories for women."

If you are fully prepared for a comet impact and others are not, people may want to steal your resources. You should be ready to defend them unless you have enough to go around. Don\u2019t go overboard on purchasing guns - make sure that you have things like food, water, and shelter before spending money on protection. A semi-automatic rifle and a pistol with enough ammunition should be more than enough firepower."

          "description":"The amount of time that the repercussions of a comet impact would negatively affect the outside environment depends on a variety of factors, like how large the comet was, where it impacted, and how close you are to the site of impact. Because of this, rationing your food and water may be crucial for your survival, as there\u2019s no concrete amount of time you will need to sustain on your food stores. Dried legumes, canned beans, and dried meat products provide the most protein and can be stored for a very long time. Nutrient-rich grains and potatoes can also provide needed calories, so make sure to be stocking up on these kinds of food. As a rule of thumb, try not to dip below 500 calories a day. While humans are capable of surviving without food for up to 40 days while hydrated, not eating enough will deteriorate your body and mind. Make sure you are eating the right kind of foods so you don\u2019t suffer from malnutrition."

However, because most generators run on fuel, it\u2019s important that you limit its usage because you will likely have a limited amount of fuel in your bunker. If you aren't in a bunker, a generator may still work, but there's a good chance that the main power grid will be down. It\u2019s a good idea to have more than one generator in case your primary generator breaks. Equip your hide-out with generator repair kits for possible repairs that will be needed."

Early reporting is notoriously inaccurate at times, so wait it out until you hear unified reports.
