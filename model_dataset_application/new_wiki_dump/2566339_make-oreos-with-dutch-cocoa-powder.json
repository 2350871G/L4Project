  "text":" Preparing the Cookie Discs Cream the butter and sugar together in a standard mixer. Beat on medium speed until the mixture turns a light color. Alternatively, you can whisk the mixture by hand. Add the egg and vanilla after turning the mixer to a low speed. Blend for a few minutes until the ingredients are well combined. Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt together in a separate bowl. Combine well before adding these to the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer on low. Gradually add the dry ingredients in several small batches, pausing to mix in between. Mix until well combined. Divide the dough in half and mold into two large discs. For the best results, shape the dough on a well-floured surface. Wrap the cookie discs in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Creating the Filling Mix the softened butter, half and half, vanilla and salt in a clean electric mixer. Whip until well combined. Add the powdered sugar gradually (using the same method as you did when adding the flour mixture for the cookies). Continue to mix on low to medium speed until well combined. Assembling the Cookies Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF/180\u00baC. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. Roll one disc of chilled dough on a floured surface. Roll to 1/8 to \u00bc thickness. Use a cookie cutter to create classic round shapes. Place the rounds on cookie sheets. You can, of course, create any cookie shape you like. Round shapes are suggested because they imitate the commercial Oreo cookie shape. Bake for 12 minutes. When baked, transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool. Select a piping bag with a large round tip. Fill with filling. Pipe the filling onto one cookie. Then add another cookie on top, to create the sandwich effect.
