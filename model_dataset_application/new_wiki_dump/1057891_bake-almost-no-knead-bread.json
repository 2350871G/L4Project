You'll need:\n300 g flour\n9 g kosher salt\n5 g powdered yeast\n1/4 quarter cup (or small handful) of flax meal or wheat germ\nA handful of brown sugar\nA big pinch of each dried thyme and dried rosemary\n200ml water. Select a mixing bowl that will hold the dough that will rise up during the maturing process. A cover is nice - but you could use plastic wrap, a damp towel or even place the whole bowl in a plastic bag. Mix all of the dry ingredients together.  Add the 200ml water. Mix wet and dry - all you are trying to do is to get all the flour incorporated in the dough. Pretty doesn't count. Cover and let sit for 8-18 hours - longer is better. Short is still not bad. Prepare the baking pan. It needs a top to hold in steam. Spray oil on the top and bottom. Dump the 'mature' dough on a floured surface. Work in the surface flour (adding as necessary). When done, make a ball and place in the baking pan. Let rise for about an hour. Minimum is doubled in size but could be 4x size for lighter bread. Put the pan containing dough in cold oven.

Set the timer for another 15 minutes. Finally, remove the finished bread and dump onto a cooling rack. Let cool for 1 hour. Don't burn yourself.
