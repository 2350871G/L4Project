  "text":" Preparing the oranges Wash the oranges. Remove any dirt or coating and wipe down. Let dry before proceeding. Cut the oranges in half. Scoop out all of the flesh. Use the flesh to make orange juice or to bake with. Place the empty orange shells onto a baking sheet. If the oranges tilt, use small blobs of poster tack or similar to keep them from rocking. Making the Jell-O (jelly) Follow the instructions on the Jell-O (jelly) packets to make the gel. However, use less water than the instructions suggest, as this will help the Jell-O to set more firmly. Pour the Jell-O into the empty orange shells. Fill right to the top of each shell. Place in the refrigerator to set.  Make the blue Jell-O (jelly). Make this one as usual; it will be turned into \"sea\" later. Place in the refrigerator to set. Making the Jell-O boats Cut each orange half in half again. This will make quarters, with the Jell-O (jelly) already set in place. Make the mast and sail. You'll need one of these per boat:\nDraw triangle sail shapes on plain paper. The triangle should be about half the size of the baguette roll, to make it look balanced. Cut out the triangle sails. Decorate if wished\u2013\u2013this can be as simple as writing on the child's name or sticking a fun sticker onto it. Poke the cocktail stick or toothpick through the sail's \"back\". Do this by threading it through two holes in the paper. Adjust the sail as needed. Place a mast and sail into each orange quarter. You now have little Jell-O (jelly) boats. Arranging an ocean scene Take the blue Jell-O (jelly) out of the fridge.  Place it onto the serving plate. Using a fork or a butter knife, cut it up into little chunks. This will form the sea underneath the boats. Avoid mushing it, the Jell-O (jelly) should still look appealing enough to scoop up and eat. Arrange the Jell-O (jelly) boats on the jello sea. Sit the boats upright with the masts sticking upright. Vary the colors around the plate or platter to enhance the look. Done. Place the Jell-O (jelly) boats on the ocean platter on the serving table.
