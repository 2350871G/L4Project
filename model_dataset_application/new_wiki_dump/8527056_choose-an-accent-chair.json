If you are planning to place the chair in a hallway it is likely to be more of a decorative piece and remain untouched. On the other hand, if you are placing the chair in the family room, you want a piece that can take a lot of wear. For example, if you have children, pets, or friends with a penchant for destruction, you'll want a chair that's durable and practical. However, if you live alone and want to make a statement, maybe you'd prefer a chair that's more artistic than practical."

Similarly, you may want to go with microfiber rather than leather. It will give you a similar look, but be far more kind to dirt and food residue.

The chair will still stand out against your other furniture, however, it will help keep symmetry in the room by matching smaller pieces. Or if you have a favorite art piece, pull one or two colors from there and find an accent chair in the same shades. You could also match the chair to the sofa if it will go in the living room. If you aren't sure where to start, choose a neutral color or a neutral, transitional style."
