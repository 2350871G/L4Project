You can usually find matcha green tea powder at Asian food markets, as well as in the ethnic or international food aisle of some larger grocery stores."

          "description":"In a separate bowl, combine the yolks from 3 eggs with the remaining \u00bd cup (approximately 105 g) sugar. Use a whisk to beat them together so the sugar is fully incorporated into the egg yolks. To separate the egg yolk from the white, crack the egg against a hard surface, such as the edge of a bowl or the counter. Hold the egg over a bowl and gently separate the two halves. Some of egg white should drip down into the bowl. To remove the rest of the white, move the contents back and forth in the two halves of the shell so more of the white drips out. When you've separated the yolk from the whites, dump the yolk in a separate bowl, and repeat with two more eggs."

It\u2019s usually easier to stir the ingredients together if you use a whisk or fork because the mixture can become very thick and difficult to blend."

Allow the milk to gently heat without coming to a boil, and remove it from the stove. You should ideally heat the milk to a temperature of 176 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius). Watch your milk closely because it\u2019s extremely easy for it to scorch. If it seems to be getting too warm too quickly, lower the heat on the stove."

Use as little milk as necessary to create the smooth paste.
