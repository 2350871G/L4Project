Then drain the prawns and repeat this step several times. The entire process should take about fifteen minutes to fully defrost your prawns. Using the microwave to defrost prawns can make them soggy or overcooked."

As you are rinsing, keep an eye out for any spoiled prawns that are discolored or slimy. Prawns should appear white or gray before cooking. Never use water that is warmer than room temperature, as this could lead to soggy or rubbery prawns."

After this length of time, they may start to go bad. For the freshest, best tasting prawns, consider cleaning and cooking them as soon as you get home from the store."

Keep them together on a tray covered with plastic wrap or in a plastic container while they are in the fridge. You can also freeze prawns for up to three months in your freezer at \u221218 \u00b0C (0 \u00b0F), but this may lead to less fresh tasting prawns.

Inside, you will see a small black line. Use the tip of the knife to pull out the vein and discard it. This black vein is the prawn's intestines. Removing it will help your prawns taste much better.
