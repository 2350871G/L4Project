Think carefully about the questions you choose, and don\u2019t ask anything you\u2019d really rather not know. Don't try to uncover deep, hurtful secrets, and beware of asking too many questions about his previous relationships. You could end up with hurt feelings, or you could dig up painful memories he'd rather forget about."

Truth or Dare is the perfect excuse to get the answer to whatever\u2019s been nagging at you! If you\u2019ve always wanted to know why he has a tattoo of a lion on his shoulder or why his nickname is \u201cTurbinado,\u201d now\u2019s the time to ask! Other questions might include something like, \u201cWhat did you think of me when we first met?\u201d or \u201cDid you know that I liked you before we ever started talking?\u201d"

You could ask something like, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite childhood memory?\u201d\nGet even more specific by asking, \u201cWhat was the best birthday you ever had?\u201d or \u201cWhat was your favorite toy when you were little?\u201d"

For instance, you might say something like, \u201cIf you could have any job in the whole world, what would it be?\u201d\nYou could also ask, \u201cWhere are 4 places you want to travel to some day?\u201d"

To get to know his values better, ask him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the moment in your life you\u2019re most proud of so far?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s something you really regret doing?\u201d"

To avoid this, have your boyfriend dial *67, which will block his number, then call a random number and try to keep the conversation going for as long as possible, or tell him he has to use a silly voice and that he\u2019s not allowed to laugh until the person hangs up.
