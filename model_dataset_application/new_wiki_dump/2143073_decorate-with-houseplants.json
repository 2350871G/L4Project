          "description":"Too many houseplants placed around the home can crowd your living space. To decorate with multiple plants and create an eye-catching centerpiece, cluster your plants in one of your home's corners and arrange them on windowsills, shelves, or plant stands. Choose plants in a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes to give your corner contrast. To make your plant corner organized, choose a theme for your plants (like succulents or flowering plants). You can even create several \"plant corners\" inside your house. If you have enough plants, you could have one in every room."

          "description":"If your bookshelves take up a lot of space but you have nothing to fill them with, space plants out evenly between the books. This will keep your shelves from looking barren while also acting as decorative bookends. Small houseplants like jade plants, Boston ferns, English ivy, and pothos make great bookends. If you want to make them blend in better, put the plants in a vase or planter that matches your home decor. If you don't have bookshelves, you could install floating shelves in your bathroom, bedroom, or anywhere else you'd like to place plants. The plants will purify your air and give you a pop of color."

This can break up the space in your room and make large rooms look fuller. Bright houseplants like flowering maples, lipstick plants, and anthuriums can make your room divider into a colorful centerpiece.
