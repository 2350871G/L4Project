Stucco walls can make great backdrops for portraits because they give texture and soft color. Cities usually have unique walls (brick, bright colors, metal, wood) you can use as backgrounds. You can even use a graffitied wall for something really different. It is important to remember to check out the background of your image. Is a tree coming out of your subject's head?"

Try taking a photo when the sun is behind your subject to create a silhouette photo. This works best near sunrise or sunset."

This is especially important with how small photos are often viewed on phones in today\u2019s age. You don\u2019t want people having to squint to try to see everything."

Adjust the light exposure to capture images in the dark. Different objects at night require different amounts of exposure. Generally, the exposure will probably not be more than 30 seconds at night. There are many things you can take photos of at night. Cities, campfires, fireworks, and the night sky make great night photographs."

          "description":"For landscape photos especially, find photos where the subjects are in various depths of the photo. Having a subject in the foreground, the middle ground, and the background makes your photo have more dimension. Change the angle you are standing so there are multiple layers to your photograph. Position a subject in the front of the photo, the middle of the photo, and far away in the back of the photo. A common way to show depth is by photographing the path of a road that trails off into the distance."

          "description":"When you are looking at your subject in the screen of your camera, imagine a 3x3 grid on the photo. Try to line the main subject of your image along one of the two vertical lines. If your image is a person, try to have their eyes along the top horizontal line of the grid, looking across the frame. Cameras usually have a setting (or phones usually have an app) that creates the 3x3 grid on the screen."

          "headline":"Use motion blur photography.",
          "description":"Slow down your shutter speed to capture objects in motion. A longer shutter speed means you can capture the movement and get a \u201cblur\u201d in your photograph. Change your camera to Shutter Priority Mode so it can adjust the exposure and aperture accordingly. Usually the subject moves to get this effect, but you can also move your camera to create a motion blur photograph."

          "headline":"Experiment with angles.",
          "description":"You can try taking photos of your subject from different angles. Taking a photo of your subject from below makes it look more powerful and important. A photo taken from above a subject makes it look weaker and less important. Using different angles can manipulate how a subject appears to the viewer of the image."

There are free online services you can try if you just want the basics such as Pixlr and PicMonkey. If you want something advanced and your budget is big enough, you can purchase a professional editing software such as Adobe Photoshop. You can also edit your images on your phone.

Changing the shadows and highlights affects the areas of the image that are specifically the darkest and the lightest. The hue and saturation can change the coloring of the image and make it more or less colorful. Making these adjustments can make a regular photo have an entirely different mood and artistic appeal."

A large landscape image can become a more specific and unique photo if it is cropped down. You will want to keep the photo size at standard photo dimensions when you crop it. Adjust the rotation of your photo to straighten it and give it a clean cut appearance or experiment by rotating the photo at a creative angle."
