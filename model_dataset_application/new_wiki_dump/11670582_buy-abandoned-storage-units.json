          "description":"Search online to find storage facilities in your area. Call each facility one by one and ask when they host their abandoned unit auctions. After they give you the date and time, ask how many units are being auctioned off. Most storage facilities host auctions on abandoned units every 1-6 months, so jot the dates and times for each auction down and pick some auctions to attend. Generally speaking, you will have more luck finding a deal if there are a lot of units being auctioned off. If you have to choose between 2 auctions, pick the auction with the highest number of available units. Facilities typically wait until they have 10-20 abandoned units to host auctions. Larger facilities may host auctions every 2-3 months, while smaller facilities usually wait 4-5 months to host auctions. The exception is when the storage facility runs out of available units and needs to free up some space. These auctions are usually free, although larger auctions may require a small entry fee."

          "headline":"Set aside 3-4 hours for an auction and bring some cash.",
          "description":"Most auctions take some time, so block off 3-4 hours on your calendar for the event. Take out as much cash as you\u2019re comfortable spending at the auction. The price of abandoned units can range from $25-5,000, so only take the cash that you\u2019re willing to spend. Most storage facilities only take cash payment for their units, but it\u2019s still a good idea to only bid cash even if they accept credit cards or checks. It\u2019s easy to get carried away when people start bidding and you get caught up in the moment, but sticking with a budget will ensure that you don\u2019t overspend. The prices for storage units fluctuate wildly based on what people are willing to gamble on. On rare occasions, the prices can exceed $5,000. This happens when a unit appears to contain rare collectibles or expensive electronics."

          "headline":"Take a flashlight and phone with you to make appraisal easier.",
          "description":"You are typically not allowed to enter an abandoned storage unit or touch its contents. This means that you\u2019ll need to rely on visual inspections from the edge of each unit\u2019s doorway. Since storage units are dark, take a flashlight to see the items at the back more clearly. Bring a phone with you in case you need to look up the price of items in the unit before bidding starts. For example, if there is a box labelled \u201cBeanie Babies 1994,\u201d you can perform a quick online search with your phone to get an estimate for what the box is worth. Keep in mind, the box may not contain what\u2019s on the label, but you can get a hint about what may be in there and decide if it\u2019s worth the gamble. Bring some padlocks with you as well. If you end up buying a storage unit, you\u2019ll need locks to secure your unit until you can pick the items up."

Once everyone has shown up, listen to the auctioneer\u2019s instructions regarding the format of the auction and the general rules. These are different from facility to facility, so listen carefully to avoid making illegal bids.Tip: The rules differ because every state has different laws regarding auctions and storage units. You typically are not allowed to touch the contents of an abandoned unit, enter an abandoned unit, or discuss bids with other attending bidders. Pay close attention to the fees and cleaning deposit instructions. Facilities typically charge fees on top of the final closing price. Most facilities also require a cleaning deposit of $50-100 to ensure that you clean the unit out after you remove the items. This deposit is returned after you clean the units you buy."

However, there may be jewelry, collectibles, or expensive goods hidden in some of the units! Cheap items, like toys, old TVs, broken furniture, and clothes are generally not worth buying.
