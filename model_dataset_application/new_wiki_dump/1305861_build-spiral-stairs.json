          "description":"Pick out a spot between two floors of your home or building that you think would make a good location for a spiral staircase. Spiral staircases tend to work best in tight spaces and parts of the room that don\u2019t receive heavy foot traffic, such as corners. Beyond that, where you put your staircase is entirely up to you. You might situate your spiral staircase in your home's foyer, or in a downstairs living room, open hallway, multi-level garage, or another suitable area. Before you get started on your project, consult your local building codes and see what criteria they contain about spiral staircases. In some cases, building codes might dictate that staircases satisfy specific spatial dimensions, including width."

Write down the measurement you get to the nearest \u20448 in (0.32 cm). This number will tell you exactly how high your staircase needs to be. If one or both floors are carpeted, be sure to start your measurement from the underlying solid flooring rather than the top of the carpet, as this is the surface you\u2019ll be building on."

          "headline":"Give your staircase a minimum diameter of 26 inches (66 cm).",
          "description":"Generally speaking, the wider your staircase is, the better it will look and the safer it will be. The total diameter of your spiral staircase, however, may be limited by the amount of space you have available. Ideally, you want your treads, or steps, to be at least 26 inches (66 cm) across in order to provide as much security and ease of navigation as possible. Plan on adding at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) to the chosen diameter of your staircase to ensure adequate finger clearance along the outer handrail. Your spiral staircase may need to be a certain minimum width if it\u2019s to serve as the main stairway for your home. For more information on stairway diameters or other safety considerations, consult your local building codes or talk to a qualified contractor."

        {
          "headline":"Make sure your treads are at least 7.5 inches (19 cm) deep on center.",
          "description":"According to national building codes in the U.S., the minimum tread depth for a spiral staircase is 7.5 inches (19 cm) at a point 12 inches (30 cm) from each tread\u2019s narrow end. This means that if you want your treads to be 36 inches (91 cm) wide, they\u2019ll need to be at least 7.5 inches (19 cm) deep at the inside of the middle section. Make a note of this as you\u2019re outlining your staircase\u2019s individual dimensions. Remember that building codes (and therefore minimum required tread depths) may differ from place to place. To avoid costly errors, it\u2019s always a good idea to check before you build. Unlike ordinary stair treads, the treads on a spiral staircase taper on the interior edge where they attach to the central support column."

        {
          "headline":"Calculate the exact number and spacing of your steps.",
          "description":"Divide the height of your staircase (in inches) by 7, which is the ideal rise, or amount of vertical distance between each step, for most staircases. Round that number to the nearest whole step, then divide the height once again by your total number of steps to figure out how much distance you\u2019ll need to leave between each step. For a planned staircase that\u2019s going to be 96 inches (240 cm) high, you would divide 96 by 7 to get 13.71, or 14 steps. You would then divide 96 by 14 to conclude that each step should be placed 6.85 inches (17.4 cm) apart. Each step of your staircase also needs to offer a minimum of 6 ft (1.8 m), 6 in (15 cm) of headroom in order to meet national building codes.Tip: You may need to add or subtract a step from your plans if your local building codes prescribe a certain minimum or maximum step height."

          "description":"Now that you\u2019ve worked out the necessary dimensions for your staircase, sketch them out on a piece of paper. This will give you a handy visual aid that you can refer back to during the construction process. Be sure to label your plans with all of the important measurements, including the height and diameter of the staircase, the exact number of steps, and the optimal depth and spacing of each tread. Double-check your plans to confirm that they\u2019re as complete and precise as possible. Making a mistake in the planning phase could end up costing you time and money once you actually begin building."

          "description":"Most spiral staircases aren\u2019t built from the ground up. Instead, they\u2019re assembled from modular kits, which come in a variety of dimensions, materials, and styles. If you just want to add an attractive spiral staircase to your living space without the painstaking work of measuring, cutting, and configuring each component yourself, a modular kit is the way to go. Modular kits come complete with everything that you need to put your staircase together, along with full, detailed instructions to guide you through the assembly process from beginning to end. Modular spiral staircase kits can range in price from as low as $1,000 to $100,000 or more.Tip: Compare different options online on the websites of major home improvement centers, or search for businesses in your area that specialize in manufacturing modular staircase kits."

The tool's weighted end will cause the attached cord to form a straight line from top to bottom. When the bob stops swaying, mark the indicated spot on the floor of the lower level with a pencil. If you\u2019re installing your staircase in an area with carpet, hardwood, tile, or laminate flooring, you\u2019ll need to remove the flooring materials in order to expose and mark the subfloor underneath.

Mark the intended height of your staircase on the edge of the pipe, then use a circular saw equipped with a carbon-steel saw blade or a rotary tool with a grinding disc to cut it to size. All-wood staircases may be constructed around a wooden post rather than a metal pipe.

Drive a screw or bolt through each hole and into the subfloor to fasten the base plate and hold the center column in place. If you haven't already, pull up the flooring material in your work area to gain access to the subfloor. Alternatively, you can purchase a premade steel base plate sized to fit your center column. These typically have slots for screws or bolts molded right into them. In order to guarantee that your center column will support the weight of both the completed staircase and its future occupants, it\u2019s important that you secure it directly to a floor joist or undamaged section of concrete subflooring."

Unless you\u2019re skilled in metalworking and have access to specialized machinery, you\u2019ll probably find it easiest to just purchase a handrail or have one made to your precise specifications.
