  "text":" Preparing the Bacon Fry the bacon. Keep a close eye on the sizzling pork as you want it as crisp as possible without having it burn. Transfer the well cooked bacon to the paper plate. Pat with paper towel to remove excess grease. Making the Pixie Stick Mixture Combine dextrose powder and cornstarch in a food processor. Blend on high speed for approximately 2 or 3 minutes (or until the mixture is a finely blended powder). Transfer the blended mixture to a clean, empty bowl. Combine the cooked bacon with half of the dextrose powder from the bowl in a food processor. Pulse until all of the ingredients are well incorporated. Add the citric acid and the rest of the dextrose powder. Pulse until the mixture resembles wet sand. Mix the tapioca maltodextrin and continue to pulse the mixture. The tapioca maltodextrin will absorb any remaining bacon grease from the mixture. Test the bacon texture before pouring into straws. It should be a fine, grease-free powder and have a taste that resembles an actual pixie stick but one with bacon flavoring. Making the Pixie Sticks Crimp and staple one end of a straw to create a base for the pixie stick. Be sure the bottom of the straw is folded under (crimped) so the powder doesn\u2019t leak out. Funnel a small amount of the bacon mixture into the straw. Push the powder downward, using a thin stick. Crimp the top of the straw once it has been filled with bacon powder. You can either add another staple or even a small piece of tape if you plan to either serve immediately or place the pixie sticks upright. Finished. The pixie sticks can be served immediately or kept refrigerated for use later.",
