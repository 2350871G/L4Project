          "description":"Perhaps the easiest way to tell the difference between a natural sapphire and a synthetic sapphire is to look at the overall quality of the gemstone. A synthetic sapphire should be nearly perfect. Natural sapphires typically have flaws because while growing they were exposed to the elements. Since synthetic or lab-created sapphires grew in a controlled environment, they are more likely to be flawless or near-flawless. A near-flawless natural sapphire would command a significant price regardless of the size. Synthetic sapphires typically will be more affordable, better quality gemstones."

          "description":"Natural pink sapphires are rare, and are cut differently from other gemstones. Jewelers typically cut stones to calibrated sizes (one carat, two carats, and so on), but pink sapphires over a half carat are cut to accentuate the stone rather than to a specific weight. Stones larger than a carat typically are more likely to be synthetic stones, especially if they cost less than a natural stone of that size would cost. Most natural sapphires are cut using a mixed cut, rather than cut to specific shapes like other natural stones."

Check watermarks for proof of the authenticity of the report. Pink sapphires may be heat-treated to bring out their natural color. Some people don't consider treated gemstones to be \"natural,\" and if the gemstone has been treated in any way this must be disclosed on the gemstone report. The report should have an ID or reference number on it. Call the company that issued the report and give them the reference number to confirm the report's validity."

Think about how trustworthy the person is who introduced you to the sapphire, as well as their background and expertise. If you're looking at a pink sapphire at an established jewelry store, you can be fairly confident that it is what they say it is. However, be cautious with less reputable dealers. Pawn shops may incorrectly label a synthetic sapphire as a natural sapphire, since it can be difficult to tell them apart. Pawn shops also typically sell gemstones \"as is\" and make no guarantees about their authenticity."
