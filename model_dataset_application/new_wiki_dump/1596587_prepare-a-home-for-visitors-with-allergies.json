These will remove allergens from the air in your home by trapping and containing them. Plug in air filters in guest bedrooms as well as other rooms where your guest will spend time. Air filters will trap pollen, pet dander, dust mites, and tobacco smoke."

Vacuum the same day, or 1-2 days before your guests arrive so that there is a minimal build-up of allergens. Be thorough and cover every fabric surface in common areas of your home. For the best results use a vacuum with a HEPA filter, which will prevent allergens from being released into the air while you are cleaning."

If your overnight guests have allergies, wash your sheets and towels in hot water to rid them of pet hair, dander, and dust mites. Use a HEPA filter vacuum to clean fabrics you can't wash, such as drapes, carpets, and furniture. You can also use zippered dust-proof covers to protect mattresses and pillows from dust mites."

Dip a clean cloth in this solution and wipe down the window surfaces thoroughly. Let them air dry. Wear gloves and a mask while you clean to protect your skin and lungs from the bleach."

Bathe your dog or your cat the day before the guests arrive so that they are as allergen-free as possible during the visit. Use a mild, vet-approved shampoo specifically designed for pets. Keep allergens down all the time by bathing your pet weekly. Be sure to inform your guests that you have pets so that they can prepare for the visit with allergy medication, or decline your invitation if their allergies are severe."
