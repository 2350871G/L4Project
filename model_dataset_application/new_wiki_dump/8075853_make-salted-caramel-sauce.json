          "description":"Add 1 cup (200 g) of granulated sugar to a medium size saucepan with a heavy bottom. Turn the burner to medium to allow the sugar to start to heat. A 2 quart (1.9 L) saucepan is usually large for the sauce. Make sure that your saucepan is clean before your start making the sauce. If there is any dirt or debris in it, crystals can form around it when you begin heating the sugar."

          "description":"As the sugar is heating, use a heat-resistant rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir it constantly. The sugar will start to clump, and eventually melt into a liquid. Continue stirring it until the liquid is thick and turns a dark amber color, which can take 5 to 10 minutes. The sugar can burn easily, so be sure to watch it and stir continuously."

          "headline":"Add the butter and stir until it melts.",
          "description":"When the sugar has melted into an amber colored liquid, mix 6 tablespoons (90 g) of salted butter that\u2019s been cut into pieces into the pan. Allow the butter to heat until it melts into the sugar, which typically takes 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the mixture regularly to help the butter melt. When you add the butter to the sugar, the caramel mixture will bubble rapidly. Be careful to avoid burning yourself. You can use unsalted butter in the sauce if you prefer. No other changes need to be made to the recipe."

Because the caramel in the pan is hotter than the cream, the mixture will bubble aggressively and possibly splatter up so be careful as you drizzle in the cream. To minimize the bubbling and splattering, bring the cream to room temperature before adding it to the caramel. You can substitute light whipping cream or double cream for the heavy cream, but don\u2019t use milk in the recipe."

If the mixture bubbles up too much to whisk it comfortably, take the pan off the heat for a moment to allow it to cool down."

Fleur de sel has a very delicate texture so it easily melts into the sauce, but any fine sea salt will work for the recipe. Make sure to mix in the salt when the sauce is still hot so it completely dissolves into the mixture."

If you are refrigerating your sauce, be sure to warm it up before serving or incorporating it into another dish. You can heat it in the microwave on high in 5 second intervals until it\u2019s thin enough to pour."
