There is a filter in place that stops most swear words, and no harm will come to you if you make sure your swear words are filtered in Studio first (an easy way is to make a script that prints your chat messages to the debug console)."

If you make games about sex, you will have a 98% chance that your game will be taken down and will be either warned or banned once the Roblox staff  receives a complaint from a user about your sexual games and has been reviewed."

However, it may not apply to anyone with admin scripts used for a specific game."

It's not true, though; how could you get robux just for copy, pasting, logging in and out? If you do that, you'll make yourself look like a fool! Don't ask players for their password or they will report you."
