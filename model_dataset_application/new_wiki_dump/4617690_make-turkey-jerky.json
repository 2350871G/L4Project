          "description":"Cover the turkey and freeze it until it is hard. This makes it hard and easier to cut into thin strips Two hours should be more than enough."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Slice the turkey into long, \u00bc inch strips.",
          "description":"Try not to have any strips thicker than 1/4 inch, but even thinner is fine if possible. You should try and keep the slices the same width so they all dry out at the same speed. If you are having trouble, let them thaw out for 20-30 minutes until they are softer and use the sharpest knife you have. Tuck your fingers into your hand and use the knuckles on your non-cutting hand to guide the knife. This way, if the knife slips, you cannot take off a finger. An electric knife, used for cutting tough meat and bone is often the easiest way to smoothly cut through frozen turkey evenly. Cut parallel to the grain, which are the strands of meat running up and down the turkey."

Simply add it to a skillet and boil it for 5 minutes before cooling, removing, and patting dry. This will also lower the time needed to dry the jerky in the oven."
