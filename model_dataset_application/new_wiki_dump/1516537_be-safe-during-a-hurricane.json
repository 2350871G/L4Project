          "description":"You should find out if you're living in an evacuation area. Usually areas close to water will be evacuated during severe storms, so you should find out if you area is one of these. That way, when severe storm warnings come in, you can be prepared to evacuate if necessary. Find out if there are any evacuation shelters near your home. Mark them on a map so you know where to go if you're forced to leave your home. Also pay attention to the topography around your home. If you live at the bottom of a hill, water will flow down towards your house. This means that your property is flood-prone, and you should take extra precautions if a storm is approaching. Sand bags around your home, for instance, could help reduce the chances of flooding. Locate high-ground in your neighborhood so you have a place to flee in case your home floods."

          "headline":"Stock your home with food and water.",
          "description":"In the event of a severe storm, you could be cut off from food for a few days. If the area loses power, local supermarkets won't be able to open. To prepare, the CDC recommends that you stock your home with at least 3 to 5 days' worth of food and water per person. Get food that doesn't go bad, like canned items. This way if you lose power your food won't spoil. It is also helpful because you can buy non-perishable items at the beginning of the hurricane season and not worry about having to replace them until at least the next year. Five gallons of water per person should be enough to last 3 to 5 days."

          "headline":"Gather other necessary supplies.",
          "description":"In addition to food and water, the CDC checklist recommends several other items you should have in your home. They include, but are not limited to:\nMedical supplies like a first aid kit and any prescription medicines you are taking. A battery-operated radio in case you lose power. A flashlight. Extra batteries for all your devices. Extra blankets. Personal care items like soap, toothpaste, and cleaning wipes in case you don't have access to water. A fire extinguisher."

To prepare for this, you should also have supplies stocked for your car. The CDC recommends the following items to ensure your health and safety if you're forced to drive in the storm. Non-perishable food and water. Emergency flares. Jumper cables. First-aid kit. Blankets. Flashlights and extra batteries. A map. You could also mark evacuation shelters or other safe places you could go if forced to leave your home on this map. A GPS navigator."

          "description":"In the event of a hurricane, it is very important for you and everyone in your house to have a plan of action. Review this plan periodically so everyone in your house is familiar with it. If you have children, it might be helpful to hold drills a few times a year so they can practice things like packing and getting into the car quickly. Some things you should include in your plan are:\nDecide at what point you will leave your home. Just because an area wasn't ordered to evacuate doesn't mean that you won't still have to leave your home. A serious storm can send surges of water that will flood homes far from the coast. A list of locations you can stay if you're forced to leave your home. How you'll communicate with other members of your family if you leave your home. If you have pets, you need to plan what you will do with them if you're forced to leave your home."

          "headline":"Install a generator.",
          "description":"High winds from hurricanes can easily knock out power. If possible, you should install a generator in the event of a power loss. This will keep your food fresh, your home lit, and your telephones working. If your generator is gasoline-operated, be sure to keep an extra supply on hand. If your generator isn't programmed to turn on automatically when the power goes out, make sure you put it in a location you can easily reach during the storm. Never locate a generator indoors. Most run on gasoline, which produces carbon monoxide. If you run a generator indoors, you will poison yourself."

        {
          "headline":"Keep trees and shrubs around your home well-trimmed.",
          "description":"Overgrown trees and shrubs have a large surface area that will catch a lot of wind when the storm starts. They could be uprooted or knocked over, which could cause damage to your home. Trimming them will make them more wind-resistant and reduce the chances that they will be uprooted."

          "description":"Standard homeowners insurance usually doesn't cover hurricane damage. Check your insurance plan and see if you're covered. If not, ask your insurance provider about getting a hurricane plan. Hurricanes are capable of severe damage, and without proper coverage you could end up with a significant financial loss."

Remove all hanging plants, furniture, barbeques, and anything else that could blow away. These items can smash into your property and cause damage, or strike cars and pedestrians and cause injury. Avoid this by moving them inside before the storm."

In addition to the obvious property damage here, the flying glass could cause injury to you or your family. If a storm is expected to be severe enough, the National Weather Service will probably recommend you board up your windows. Listen to the most recent reports to find this out. To do so, use plywood boards and nail them over your windows. If you live in a hurricane-prone area, it would be better to install permanent storm shutters on your windows. This way when a storm is approaching you can simply flip them closed to protect your windows."

It would also be a good idea to have a few emergency containers full of gas in addition to your car's tank. If the area loses power or stations sustain damage, gas may be unavailable for a few days after the storm. Make sure you have an extra supply of gas to get through this situation. If you live in a hurricane-prone area, it is recommended that you always have your gas tank at or above 1/2 tank throughout the season to prepare for unexpected storms."
