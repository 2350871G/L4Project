You should also inspect your land to see if there is anything that would make clearing it especially difficult, like very large trees or steep hillsides. If you don\u2019t have the time, tools, or know-how, this is a job you should get a contractor or other expert to help out with. Depending on the complexity of your project, you might hire a contractor to do all of the land clearing for you. Alternatively, you could hire people to take care of some aspects of the land clearing and handle others yourself. For instance, you might feel prepared to clear brush and fell small trees, but could hire an arborist or logging company to handle any that are especially large."

Contractor costs will be based on things like:\nThe size of the plot\nHow quickly the land needs to be cleared\nWhether the plot has any features that make clearing difficult (steep hills, remote location, unusual soil types, etc.) The time of year\nWhether any subcontractors will need to be hired"

If you have low ground vegetation, you can use grazing animals like sheep or goats to clear it. Sometimes, these animals can work surprisingly quickly.
