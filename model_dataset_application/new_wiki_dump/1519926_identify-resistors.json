Count the number of colored bands on the resistor so you can calculate the specific resistance value, or the number of ohms. A 4-band resistor has 3 colored bands on the left side and 1 colored band on the right side. The first 2 bands represent the first 2 numbers, and the third band represents the multiplier or the number of zeroes that need to be added to the first 2 numbers. The fourth band on the far right represents the tolerance, or the accuracy of the value represented by the bands on the resistor. On a 5-band resistor, the first 3 colored bands represent the digits, the fourth is the multiplier, and the fifth band represents the tolerance. A 6-band resistor is the same as a 5-band, with the first 3 representing the numbers, the fourth is the multiplier, and the fifth is the tolerance.

Using the Code on SMD Resistors Identify SMD resistors by locating the 3 or 4-digit code on top. Surface Mount Resistors or SMD Resistors, are small, rectangular resistors that are soldered directly onto a circuit. They are usually black and will have a 3 or 4 digit number printed on top of them. The code is generally located on top of the SMD resistor.
