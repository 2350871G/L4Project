          "description":"Fungus can be an extremely difficult level, especially on Brutal, so you'll want to choose the proper genes to help you get through. If you don't have the following genes available, choose anything else that you prefer or which is close. DNA Gene - Metabolic Hijack or Cytochrome Surge. Metabolic Hijack will automatically pop red and orange bubbles. This is useful as all the red bubbles show up immediately when using the fungus\u2019s spore abilities. Cytochrome Surge will give you more DNA from orange bubbles. Travel Gene - Suppression. This helps the gene cross country borders. Don\u2019t boost planes or ships as the fungus gene is hard to transmit through these methods. Evolution Gene - Patho-Stasis. This gene stops the increase of DNA costs which you will rely heavily on. Mutation Gene - Genetic Mimic or Creationist. Both of these options will make it harder to cure the fungus. Environment Gene - Extremophile. This will allow the fungus to get a bonus in all environments, helping it spread on land. If you don't have this option, pick the boost that will most benefit your starting country."

China seems to be a popular option as the dense population will allow the fungus to spread faster. China seems to be the most reliable option due to its large population, ports, and large land mass. Other countries you may want to consider starting in are Madagascar or India. Other guides suggest starting in Norway to make infecting Greenland and Iceland easier. Saudi Arabia and South Africa can also generate a win. You want to pick a country with a high population and ports."

The key to surviving is to devolve any symptoms that randomly mutate before the symptoms can raise awareness of your fungus. You will need to devolve symptoms throughout the game. The fungus will automatically develop new symptoms, so keep an eye out to quickly devolve. You may want to consider the Translesion + gene if you are having difficulty with costs to devolve.

Evolve the following abilities and transmissions in order to help spread your disease: \nWater and Air Transmission 1. Bird 1 can also help due to the fungus in bird droppings. But this transmission isn't always necessary. Drug, Heat, and Cold Resistance 1. After you\u2019ve updated these to level 1, focus on your Spore Burst abilities before continuing to level 2."

Save a few Spore Bursts for the end of the game to infect any hard-to-reach countries. Saving a few bursts can help you get Greenland if you haven\u2019t infected it yet."
