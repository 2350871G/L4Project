  "text":" Cut 1/2\" holes at either end of all three boards. Align them with each other, and leave enough space between them to accommodate the scale you will use. Cut (counter-board) two recessed holes on 2x4 that forms the bottom plank. Make them wide and deep enough to hold standard nuts and washers. Place a set of nuts and washers onto the ends of the threaded rods, about an inch from the end. Run the threaded rods through the holes in the base. Then screw the base down with another set of lock nuts and washers. The recessed holes are so that the finished press will sit flat on a table or bench. You should now have the base sandwiched between nuts and washers at the bottom end of the threaded rods. Put a second set of nuts a short distance up the threaded rods. Place washers on top. The second board may not rest on these washers when the mold is in place, but it keeps the lower 1x4 from getting a bigger hole that can cause uneven tops on cheese wheels. Place board two over the threaded rods. It will rest on the washers from the previous step. Place a washer then a spring and another washer on each threaded rod, in that order.  Place board three over the threaded rods. It will rest on top of the springs and the uppermost washers. Screw washers and wing nuts down on the top board.  Fashion your mold. Use PVC pipe  4-6\" in diameter and 6-7\" tall. Drill holes about 1\" apart for drainage. Cut round wooden followers. They are needed to fill up the mold.
