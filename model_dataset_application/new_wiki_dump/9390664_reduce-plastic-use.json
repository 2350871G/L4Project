          "description":"Straws have become a huge problem in ocean contamination--in fact, they\u2019re one of the most common pieces of trash picked up on beaches. Eliminating straw use is easy and straightforward--if you order a drink that comes with a straw, just tell the waiter, barista, or worker that you don\u2019t need one. You can also invest in reusable straws made of glass or stainless steel.

Carmela has a Masters in Public Policy Analysis from New York University and is passionate about youth empowerment, social impact, and traveling. Carmela Resuma, MPP\t\t\tWorld Traveler & Executive Director, FLYTE\t\t\t\tWhere does that plastic end up? Often, the ocean. Carmela Resuma, Executive Director of FLYTE, tells us: \"I think about every single-use plastic that I purchase now. When you see a polluted beach in a formerly beautiful place, you realize that those straws and those plastic bags are all going to end up somewhere. You gain perspective \u2014 there are other people in the world affected by this pollution.\""
