  "text":" Choosing Lace for Flowers Purchase lace ribbon from a fabric or craft store. You can also purchase remnants of lace edging or ribbon on the Internet or at many thrift stores. Make your own lace ribbon with lace hem facing. You can run one or two layers through your sewing machine to improve the look of the lace. Layer your lace and run it through a ruffler foot attached to your sewing machine. A straight stitch through a ruffler foot will result in pretty gathered ribbon for your flower. Find old lace material if you can\u2019t locate lace ribbon. You can fold the lace fabric horizontally and run it through your sewing machine and ruffle foot to create a finished edge that will not break or fray. Consider layering different colors of lace before you ruffle it or sew it together. It will create a multi-colored flower. Cut five inches (13cm) of lace ribbon for a small flower. Cut ten inches (25cm) of lace ribbon for a large flower. Use sharp fabric scissors to improve the edges. Making a Flower Base Purchase felt in a color that matches your lace ribbon. It will provide the backing for your flower. Since lace is a delicate and opaque fabric, a contrasting color will likely show through the lace flower. Cut the felt into a circle. For small flowers, use a circle that is two inches (5cm) in diameter. For a large flower, cut a circle that is four inches (10cm) in diameter. Lay your length of lace ribbon out on your craft table. Keep in mind that the finished edge should be on the outside of the flower. The unfinished edge, if there is one, should be glued to the interior of the felt. Making Lace Flowers Heat up your hot glue gun. You can also use very strong fabric glue, as long as it is applied with a fine tip applicator. Squeeze a line of glue one-fourth the way around the outside of your felt circle.  Lay one end of the lace ribbon across this glue line. Make sure you set the rough, inside edge against the glue, instead of your finished edge. Allow the glue to set for five minutes, so that it doesn\u2019t come loose while you wrap the ribbon around the felt. As you wrap the lace, you will need to turn it in a circular pattern. As you wrap it, it will gather into a circular bloom shape. Squeeze a glue line along the remaining edge of the circle. Wrap your lace ribbon around that edge in a circle. When you come to the starting edge, you will bring the lace inside to spiral it in a petal pattern. Hold the lace in place and allow the glue to set for five minutes, if the lace is slipping away from the felt circle. Apply another line of glue in a circle on the felt, just inside the outer layer of lace. Wrap the lace in a spiral and press the edge onto the glue. Repeat the spiral of glue and lace until you come to the center of the circle. Press the lace down with a toothpick or pencil to avoid burning yourself with hot glue. Cut the lace if you have excess in the center of your circle. Use a matching thread and a needle to secure the center of the lace on the felt circle as you would a button. Glue a pearl or sew a button on to the center of the lace flower. It will look like a style, or center, of the flower. You may want to choose a contrasting color to improve your flower design. Attach a clip or pin to the back of the flower for use as an accessory. ",
