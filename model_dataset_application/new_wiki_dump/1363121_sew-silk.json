          "description":"Silk fabric has a tendency to shrink, which can alter the size and look of your sewing project. By prewashing the fabric, you will minimize the amount of shrinkage that might occur when you wash the fabric after you\u2019ve completed the project. Typically, silk will shrink about 5-10%, with some looser weavers shrinking up to 15%. Use a mild detergent, such as Woolite or Ivory Snow, with warm water, washing the silk in a sink or bucket. Alternately, use a mild shampoo. You can also wash some silk fabrics in the washing machine. Use a delicate cycle and a mild detergent. A few silks, such as dupioni, should be dry cleaned only."

          "description":"If you have bright or deep colored silk, it\u2019s best to wash these separately. Dyes used on silk have a tendency to run, and you don\u2019t want to discolor your fabric. Take the time to do separate washes to ensure that colors don\u2019t bleed from one piece to another. Prewashing strong colors will also ensure that the colors don\u2019t bleed after you have sewn your project."

          "description":"There are several methods of drying silk fabric, depending on your preference. Try partially drying the fabric in the dryer. Remove the fabric when it is still damp and hang up to finish drying. Alternately, you can dry the silk between two towels, or let it hang dry right after you have washed it."

          "description":"Because silk is slippery, use very sharp scissors so that the cuts you make to the fabric will be smooth and clean. It may be useful to have regular sewing shears as well as pinking shears. Pinking shears are scissors that cut little triangles along the edge of fabric. This can help with fraying, which silk has a tendency to do."

          "headline":"Choose a small sewing machine needle.",
          "description":"A fine, sharp needle will leave smaller holes in the silk fabric. Since silk is prone to showing holes easily, choose a small-sized needle to use when sewing your project. A 60/8 Microtex or Universal needle is an ideal size. Have a few spare needles on hand while you work on your project. It is a good idea to replace needles every so often so that you are constantly using a very sharp needle. Silk fibers are quite tough and can dull the needle easily. If you are hand-sewing, choose a very sharp, fine needle."

          "headline":"Choose a good quality cotton or polyester thread.",
          "description":"Choose a thread to match your fabric. Cotton-wrapped or 100% polyester thread are good choices. While some people might like to use silk thread with silk fabric, silk thread is not very strong and can fray easily."

          "headline":"Choose a flat-bottomed foot for your sewing machine.",
          "description":"The foot on a sewing machine will press down the fabric while the needle moves up and down. A flat-bottomed foot is recommended, as it will not snag on the silk as the fabric moves through the machine. Alternately, choose a walking foot, which keeps the silk from sliding around."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Clean and dust your sewing machine.",
          "description":"Working with a clean, dust-free machine is a good rule of thumb whenever you sew, but it is particularly important when sewing a delicate fabric such as silk. Wipe down the machine to remove any residue on the machine. To remove dust, you can use a pressurized air canister to blow air into the crevices and cracks of your machine."

          "description":"Silk pins are extra fine pins that leave very tiny holes in silk fabric. These are useful for pinning patterns to fabric without noticeably marring the surface of the fabric. Pattern weights are used to hold fabric stationary on the cutting surface so that it doesn\u2019t shift around when you are cutting. You can also use heavy objects such as canned food to hold down the fabric."

        {
          "headline":"Cut each pattern piece one at a time.",
          "description":"With other types of fabric, you can usually cut same-shaped pattern pieces together, doubling up the fabric. With silk, however, it\u2019s best to cut each pattern piece individually. Silk slips around too much, and cutting through two layers of fabric might cause errors in cutting out the pattern. For pattern pieces on a fold, redraw the piece as it would be folded out. This way, you won\u2019t have to cut two layers of fabric at once."
