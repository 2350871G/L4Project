If you don't want to completely remove it from the oven, you can also pull the rack out just enough to access the baked food. Insert a single, clean (unused) toothpick into the center of the cake or bread until it is almost all the way in.  Pull the toothpick back out of the cake or bread by pulling directly up at the same angle at which you inserted it.  Examine the toothpick.

If the toothpick came out wet, put the cake or bread back in the oven and perform the toothpick test again in another five minutes.  Use toothpicks to cut a cake into layers Take a ruler and measure the height of your cake. Let's assume that your cake is 2 inches (5cm) high. Take a toothpick and insert it horizontally into the side of your cake at half the height of the cake. In this case, you would insert the toothpick 1 inch (2.5cm) from the bottom of the cake. Make sure to insert the toothpick half-way into the cake so that there is still half sticking out of the cake. Repeat the process of marking the middle of your cake until you've gone all the way around. It's useful to continue using a ruler as a guide. A good rule of thumb is to insert a toothpick every 2 inches (5cm) apart. Take a long piece of dental floss and wrap it around the circumference of your cake. You'll want a piece long enough so that after it wraps around your cake, you still have some to hold in your hands. Align the dental floss so that it's sitting right on the toothpicks if you're looking at the cake from above.
