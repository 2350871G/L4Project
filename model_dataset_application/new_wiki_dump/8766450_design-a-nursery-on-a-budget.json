While you may want to err on the side of caution and buy new for things like cribs, other items can easily be purchased secondhand. Things like furniture, a changing table, and even some decorations can be secondhand. Be on the lookout for flyers for garage sales. You can also hit up established thrift stores in your area.

Create an account on websites like Swap.com, FreeCycle, and ThredUp.com. Go through your home and look for items you no longer need or use. Chances are, there are many things you planned to give away, donate, or sell. These can be traded for baby or nursery supplies. Make sure to pick high quality items of your home. People will not be happy with you if they don't receive good items in return for a trade. Choose items that have minimal damage and that you have not used much over the years. For example, try trading the extra chair at your dining room table no one ever uses."

You can also sign up for e-mail lists for stores you love to wait for online sales. Sites like Craigslist and eBay often let you purchase items for cheap. Practice basic safety if you meet up with someone online to make a purchase. Meet in a public place and, if possible, bring someone else with you."

A low-cost lamp, dresser, or bookshelf will likely hold up fairly well. You can save some money by shopping at somewhere like Target or Walmart to get these kinds of items."

Instead of having many decorations spread across the room, pick something like a large area rug for the center of the room. This will draw attention to a single spot in the room, making it look decorative while saving you money on excess decorations. Look for cheaper items for your focal point as well to save even more money. Check secondhand stores and discount websites to find the centerpiece you want."

Even if you're not artistically inclined, things like stencils are easy enough to use. If you want a decorative dresser, for example, buy one secondhand. Paint it yourself and then stencil on the designs you want. Use chalkboard paint. You can use colorful chalk to draw any designs you want. As your baby gets older, they'll be able to experiment with painting and drawing on the wall."

While you're waiting for the toys to be safe for your baby, use them as decorations. This will save you money buying knick-knacks for shelves and drawers. Fill in bare spots in your bookshelf with stuffed animals. For example, a stuffed owl could be placed on the bookshelf. Place things like figurines, plastic dolls, and action figures on mantels and dressers."

This can spruce up the room and add a splash of color without making you go over-budget on expensive decorations. You can also paint duller items in your nursery. For example, a yellow dresser can brighten up a room. Try painting a neutral-color piece of furniture in a bright, kid-friendly shade."
