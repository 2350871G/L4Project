Some platforms like Mixer and YouTube Gaming allow you to stream directly from your console if you don't have a computer to stream. If you're a PC gamer, you can get a dedicated streaming computer and play the game on a separate computer or stream and play games on the same machine. You\u2019ll also need a fast internet connection to stream games online. If you\u2019re streaming on one computer, you\u2019ll want a PC with a 4-12 core CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a graphics card that supports DirectX 10. If you\u2019re streaming on a dedicated streaming PC and gaming on a separate computer, the streaming computer does not need a good video card, but does need to have a video capture card. A good gaming/streaming PC will cost anywhere from $1,000-$3,000. To stream at a decent quality, you\u2019ll want an upload speed of 2-5 MB/s and a download speed of 40-100 MB/s.

This makes it easier to get lost as a new streamer amongst all the competition. YouTube Gaming has a large potential audience and is easy to set up but you cannot start monetizing your stream until you have at least 10,000 views."
