If necessary, increase the temperature on your hot water heater while doing this, but be sure to turn it back down when you're done so no one gets scalded. This method may use up your hot water for awhile, so be sure everyone in the family has showered or bathed for the day before doing this."

They're long enough that you can stay far enough away from the roof to prevent getting buried in snow and ice when it comes down. Extend the handle of the rake so that it reaches the gutter. Place the rake head horizontally at the edge of your gutter and roof. Then pull down toward the ground, scooping ice and snow out of your gutters."
