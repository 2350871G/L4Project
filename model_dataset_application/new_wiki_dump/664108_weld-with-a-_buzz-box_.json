      "headline":"Before we start, let's get an understanding of what happens when we strike an arc with welding electrodes.",
      "description":"The size of the welding rod, amperage and plate thickness determine weld fusion (adhesion) initially. In other words, a large diameter welding rod on a thin steel plate will blow right through it. On the flip side, a small diameter welding rod on thick steel plate may not start the arc and, if you do, the weld will not fuse to the steel but simply lay on the surface of the steel plate. This is where preheat comes to your aide. Preheat allows you to use small welding electrodes with your buzz box on thick steel plate."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Prepare The Bevels and Lands",
      "description":"Prepare to clean the steel plates by donning your safety equipment, welding helmet, welding gloves and a dust mask for particles. \"Junk In, Junk Out\", is exactly what you will get if you do not prepare the steel plates for welding. Never weld through trash, rust or scale if you have the means to clean the steel. The bevel should approximate 45 degrees with a 1/8\" land (flat) at its base."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Set The Root Gap",
      "description":"When the bevel has been applied to both steel plates, turn them face down, set the root gap (I use the metal stub of the welding electrode I'm welding with) and employ spot welding to tack them into position."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Position The Steel Plates",
      "description":"Now that the plates have been cleaned, beveled and tacked, clamp the steel plate in a position of comfort and prepare to weld the root pass. Gather your welding supplies, gas and torch for preheating, welding electrodes, stinger and your Buzz Box."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Preheat The Steel Plates",
      "description":"It is never a bad Idea to preheat, in fact, almost every welding job I perform professionally demands a preheat temp of 400 degrees and up. You will be amazed at how easily the arc strikes and how  well the welding rod burns, improving welding quality significantly. Bear in mind, once the steel has  reached preheat temp, this temp must be maintained throughout the procedure till all welding  is finished."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Run The Root Pass",
      "description":"Extra care should be taken when running the root pass because If the root pass has good fusion and  is watertight, the rest of the welding is just formality especially when welding pipe. Make sure the  joint is good and hot and you are comfortable during the weld. Comfort means control."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Run The Fill Passes",
      "description":"Run the welds in steps starting with the root  pass, the intermediate fill pass and the final fill. As  you step up the welds, pay particular attention to tying in the sides, this is the strength of your  welding. The \"Cap\" passes are where you let your skills shine. They can be as few as one or as many as it will  take to cover the filled joint you just welded. This is your signature so take your time and get them  straight and the proper height. The grand finale' of this episode is to turn the plate over, grind out the root opening down to flawless metal, preheat the steel plate, fill the joint and run the caps, you're done."
