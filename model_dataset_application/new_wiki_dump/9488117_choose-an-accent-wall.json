          "description":"The focal point of a room is not always the wall you see when you first walk in. Go with the wall that you want to draw attention to because it\u2019s interesting or unique in some way. For example, in a room with a fireplace, accent the fireplace wall. If you have built-in bookshelves, an interesting nook, wainscoting, or something else architecturally distinctive, highlight those elements. In a bedroom, the wall behind your headboard is a good choice for an accent wall. If you have a unique sofa, dramatic artwork, or another bold piece in the room, accent the wall behind it."

          "description":"Think about how you plan to decorate the space and what furniture you have to work with. That way, you can use those elements and the accent wall to create a focal point in the room. If you\u2019re working with a brand new and unfurnished space, the accent wall will determine the color scheme for the rest of the room, so keep that in mind. For example, if you have a collection of framed family photos you want to hang, showcase them against the backdrop of the accent wall. Gorgeous indoor plants can also serve as focal points. If you have a special plant or had your eye on something at the nursery, spotlight it with an accent wall.

Sam Adams, design firm owner, says: \u201cI like to put accent walls behind TVs, so that the television is less of a focal point in the room. A TV will draw your eye on a white wall far more than a dark wall. With a dark accent wall, the TV will sort of \"go away\" when it\u2019s turned off.\u201d"

          "description":"Accent walls look best against solid walls that have no openings, such as windows and doors. If you have large, open windows with a view of beautiful scenery, that wall isn\u2019t necessarily a good wall to accent. The accent color may distract more than accentuate it. Natural light from large windows can also alter how the paint color looks on the wall, and you may not like the results. This isn't a hard and fast rule, so if you have your heart set on accenting the wall with windows or a door, do it."

Accenting the farthest short wall will make that wall appear closer to you and balance the oblong shape of the room. Overall, this creates a more proportionate vibe in your space. If you aren't interested in proportions or if you want to emphasize the length of a room, ignore this advice. These are just basic rules of thumb. You have total artistic freedom, so feel free to break any \"rule\" you want."

          "description":"Rich, vibrant colors work well for accent walls, but if you\u2019re leaning toward a particularly bold statement color, like fire engine red, think carefully before you take the plunge. This is especially true if the color you\u2019re considering is a current trend. Trends come and go, and in the long run you\u2019ll probably be happier with something more neutral. Color trends like bright purple and aqua don't have to be avoided completely! If you're considering a bold or unusual color, consider a slightly muted shade of that color. If you don\u2019t mind painting the room again when you\u2019re over the statement color, then you should go for it. If you don\u2019t want to paint again in a year or 2, opt for a muted shade."

          "description":"Different colors convey different energies, and these energies can have a significant effect on some people. If you\u2019re painting a bedroom, for instance, a red accent wall might be jarring or make it difficult to fall asleep. A color like cerulean blue, which is still a vibrant hue, may create a more calming atmosphere. In a room where you want to create energy, like a den or playroom, vibrant options like lime or chartreuse work well. A bathroom might benefit from a calmer green, like seafoam green. The temperature of the color plays a role, too. Warm colors like red and orange create a different vibe than cool tones like green, blue, and purple."

          "headline":"Go with a color that is darker than the other walls in the room.",
          "description":"A darker hue will contrast with the lighter walls and pull eyes straight to it, which is what you want. A good rule of thumb is to paint the accent wall the same color as the other walls, but 2 shades darker. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable going wild with color choice and placement, this route tends to be foolproof. You don\u2019t have to do this. A light accent wall in a darker room can work, but it\u2019s riskier. When the focal point in the room is lighter than the wall across from it, the room may feel off balance or disorienting."

          "description":"This may seem like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s extremely important! The accent wall must work with your existing d\u00e9cor, and the best way to connect it is by replicating a color from the current color scheme. Secondary colors (rather than the main color) in your current color scheme are usually a great choice for accent walls. For example, the color of your throw pillows or in the pattern of the sofa fabric would work well. A color that pops up frequently in your wall art is another strong choice. If your current decor consists of a navy blue couch with forest green pinstripes, forest green throw pillows, navy blue curtains and a small green rug, consider using green for your accent wall.
