Most freezers don\u2019t run the evaporator fan motor when the door is open, so if the fan does work, it will turn off when you open the door.

If you hear that sort of sound, something may be caught in the fan blades or the motor may be dying. If you hear a high pitched sound, you will need to remove the rear panel to gain access to the fan motor. The condenser is usually not located at the back of the freezer, so the evaporator fan motor should be the only thing making noise behind the rear panel."
