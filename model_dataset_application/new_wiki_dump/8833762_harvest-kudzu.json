          "description":"Kudzu has large, green vines that can climb as high as 100 feet (30 m) in trees. The leaves have three-parts and are between 4\u20136 inches (10.2\u201315.2 cm) in length. The flowers are purple and smell strongly of grapes. The roots are thick and go deep underground. Make sure to watch for poison ivy, which is often found intertwined with kudzu. They both have three-part leaves of a similar bright green color. However, kudzu leaves are usually larger and aren\u2019t as smooth on the sides. Some areas offer seminars on how to identify and use kudzu. Find one by entering your location and \u201ckudzu seminar\u201d into a search engine."

          "description":"Kudzu can grow almost anywhere, but you are less likely to find significant growths in the winter periods. The winter weather kills off many of the leaves and green shoots of the kudzu, making the roots easier to access in colder weather. If you are interested in the leaves, then it is best to harvest them in the late spring and summer. The flowers reach their peak in August and stay active until September."

          "description":"To harvest kudzu, you will need to go into overgrown areas, possibly with thorns and other hazards. Choose an outfit that fully covers both your arms and legs. If you plan to dig up the roots, bring a sturdy pair of gloves and wear work boots as well. Put on protective eyewear to keep your eyes safe from swinging vines."

This means that snakes and other dangerous animals and insects can be hard to see. For that reason, let other people know when you are going out to harvest and, if possible, don\u2019t go alone. Try to make as much noise as possible when harvesting to scare off any animals."
