          "description":"Pergo floors will attract dust, so you\u2019ll want to make sure you wipe it clean regularly with a dust mop to remove the most obvious particles. A regular wipe with a dry mop or static cloth should get most of the dust. Before wiping down the floor, wet your dust mop slightly. A bucket of water nearby should be enough to keep the mop moist. You don\u2019t want to soak your mop, just get it damp. If it is too wet, wring it out before putting on the floor. If you are cleaning in sections, you can also use a spray to mist the floor before mopping. Mix 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of warm water. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle, spray the floor, then quickly wipe with your mop. There should not be any moisture left after a minute of drying."
