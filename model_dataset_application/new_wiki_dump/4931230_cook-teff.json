Use teff flour for one fourth of the flour in your recipe and regular all-purpose flour for three fourths. Adding some teff flour to recipes adds nutrients and an interesting nutty flavor. If you have a kitchen scale, substitute teff flour by weight instead of volume. Teff is denser than all-purpose flour so for a more accurate recipe use an amount of teff flour equal to the weight of one fourth of the flour in your recipe. For recipes with whole grain flours like buckwheat flour you can substitute more of the flour for teff flour. Try using half teff flour and half buckwheat flour in a recipe that calls for buckwheat."
