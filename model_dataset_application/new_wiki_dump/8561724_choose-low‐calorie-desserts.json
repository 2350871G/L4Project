Pay attention to the number of calories listed towards the top of each label. Then, see how many of these calories come directly from fat. You want to find a dessert with low calories that also contains a low amount of fat. Make sure to only compare similar dessert items to one another. Otherwise, you may make a false comparison due to differing serving sizes. For example, it is a good idea to compare various ice creams, but putting these numbers up against a muffin\u2019s food label may not provide a clear picture."
