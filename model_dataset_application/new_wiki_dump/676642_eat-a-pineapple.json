Using a sharp knife, carefully cut off the top and bottom half-inch (1.3 cm) of the pineapple. To determine if a pineapple is ready for eating, hold the fruit steady, pinch a center leaf from the stem with two fingers, and gently pull the leaf. If it comes out easily, the pineapple is ripe."

          "description":"Stand the pineapple on its bottom base. Use a sharp knife to slice off thin lengthwise strips of skin from the pineapple. The slices should be about a quarter-inch (0.6 cm) deep to remove as much of the skin and divots as possible. Go around the entire fruit until all the skin has been peeled off. Once the skin is gone, go around the fruit and carefully cut out any brown divots that are still left in the fruit."

Cut the pineapple into slices or discs that are between a half-inch and an inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick. You may need to cut the slices thinner or thicker than this for different applications, so read and follow any recipes that you may be using before slicing the fruit."

The core is the darker yellow flesh that runs through the middle of the fruit. You can also use a knife to cut the core from each slice if you don\u2019t have a cookie cutter."
