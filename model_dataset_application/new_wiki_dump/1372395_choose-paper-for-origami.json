          "description":"Before you get to folding, consider how large or small the design you\u2019re trying to make needs to be. Complex, impressive pieces may benefit from added size, which means you should use a sheet of paper that is larger and can be folded more ways. On the other hand, smaller paper forces you to work meticulously, and results in stunning, delicate shapes. Origami paper can come cut as large as 30\u201dx20\u201d, and as small as a mere 1\u201dx1\u201d for challenging miniature pieces."

Origami paper can be found in a multitude of color combinations, with products like duo paper which has a different color on each side. Other papers feature brightly-colored patterns and embellishments, each presenting unique possibilities. Different colors will suit different projects. For instance, an origami strawberry can be fashioned from red and green duo paper, while a lotus may look best in one tasteful pastel sheet."

Certain types of washi, or traditional Japanese origami paper, are woven from plant fibers and are characterized by a soft, slightly wrinkled consistency. These papers can give completed projects an added degree of visual texture and appeal. Other types of textured paper-like momigami (a leathery paper made from the bark of the mulberry tree) and foil paper highlight surface detail while also manipulating the way light hits the contours of the design."

Working with alternative shapes requires you to view your project from a fresh perspective and changes the types of techniques you\u2019re able to employ and designs you\u2019re able to create. Some techniques may be altered drastically when using oddly shaped papers, as there may be more or fewer precise edges and corners to aid in folding."

Choose duo paper when you\u2019re folding shapes that benefit stylistically from a certain color scheme (such as red and green for a rose), or if your purpose is to make the design more intricate by incorporating different layers of color.

Chiyogami paper is more elaborate in appearance than other varieties, and is an available option should you wish to learn traditional Japanese shapes and folding styles. There are many traditional origami papers bearing classic Japanese aesthetics. In addition to basic chiyogami, there is yuzen, a particular variation of chiyogami that features prints inspired by popular fabrics from ancient Japan; momigami, fashioned from mulberry bark and known for its leathery texture; and shinwazome, a thick, brilliantly adorned paper with embossed patterns that is often used for more extravagant projects."

Foil origami paper is sure to catch the eye as your designs sparkle with a gold, silver, or ruby glint. The foil will also help preserve your folds, as the pliable metallic layer holds a crease that won\u2019t spring back out of place. Another additional benefit of working with foil paper is that it allows the handler to fashion smooth curves in their designs that easily maintain their shape. It will be hard to hide mistakes made with foil paper, as the paper will remain crinkled even after it is smoothed out."

Return the art to its ultimate simplicity by folding any sort of paper you come across, including newsprint, magazine pages, card stock, and wrapping paper. This way you\u2019ll never run out of supplies, and your projects will take on an intriguing, homemade vibe. Working with found paper reinforces the original spirit of origami, which is a form of art that can be practiced anywhere at any time with most any materials. Not all found paper types will fold with the same degree of success. Copy paper can be found anywhere, is sturdy and holds a crease well, but is too thick for more detailed designs, while newsprint and other similar materials is thin enough to allow for more complex folds but creases stubbornly, and is usually quite weak and therefore prone to tearing."

Choosing one of these eye-catching paper design will allow you to infuse a little contemporary flair. Because patterned papers are printed in a certain directional configuration, they may be best for simpler designs. In complex shapes, the print may run together and be disorienting to the eye."

Some papers can be quite large, allowing for oversized, statuesque pieces, while smaller variants are used to produce elegant miniatures. Vary the dimensions of the paper you use to have many different sizes of origami to put on display. You can also cut found paper to whatever specifications you prefer if the size of a premade paper won\u2019t do."

When you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ll have a one-of-a-kind piece of paper art to show off. The number of ways you can design your own origami paper is limited only by the depth of your imagination.
