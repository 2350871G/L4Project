Because the copies are shorter, anyone who cuts the deck does so at one of the longer, regular cards. Turn over the top card on the split to reveal your trick card. You can cut a Svengali deck multiple times, always finding a duplicate card. Mix this with dribbling and shuffling techniques to fool your audience with more complicated tricks.

Hold the stacks so a single corner on each almost touches. Use your thumbs to lift the long edge of each deck up, then release the cards one by one to shuffle them into a single deck. The deck doesn\u2019t actually get shuffled. When you master riffling, you can make the cards fall in pairs. Each pair consists of a regular card and a copy card. If you used the regular alternating set up for your deck, the copies are always on top of the bigger cards. Use the space left by the shorter cards to alternate releasing card pairs from both halves of the deck. Because of the alternating pattern you used to set up the deck, the copies are always on top of the bigger cards and easy to find. To find them without the audience noticing, dribble, riffle, or cut the cards to bring a regular card to the top. They are shorter than the regular cards, so they leave small gaps in the deck. As you get used to riffling, try doing it while arching the cards into a bridge. It\u2019s very flashy, and if you do it fast enough, no one will notice the shorter cards in the deck."
