Think of hobbies like reading, gaming, or exercising that are fairly easy to do at home. Reading, painting, writing, and learning a new language are all things you can do in the house."

If you can spend the money, consider taking a class or going to special events.

For this reason, it may be better to choose a low-commitment hobby that isn't critically important to others or requires you to invest a lot of your time. Think of lower stress hobbies that you can do independently if your schedule is hectic. Some low commitment hobbies include hiking, reading, journaling, volunteering, drawing, coloring, and cooking."
