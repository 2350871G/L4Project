      "headline":"Decide on whether you want to collect the vintage sewing tools and accessories according to a theme (category), an era, or some other method.",
      "description":"There is a lot of sewing gear available to you and it can become overwhelming if you don't settle on a method for collecting. Some approaches to collecting include:\nChoose an era. Collect sewing items made for a set period, such as Victorian times, war years, a particular decade such as the 20s or 60s, etc. The advantage of this is that the items can be narrowed down and you can have a lot of fun hunting them down, learning about which items belong to the specific era, etc., and you can focus your budget. A disadvantage to this approach is that you will have to leave items when they don't match your collection and it might become too narrow if the era you have picked is either full of rare and expensive items, or the items become rapidly repetitive. Choose a theme or category. The theme or category approach can work brilliantly in collecting vintage sewing accessories because it is broader than an era and lets you roam widely for items that fit within your theme. Examples of themes might include a focus on thimbles/chatelaines/needle cases/tape measures, etc., (see list below for a whole range of ideas), or it could be slightly broader, such as bone or pearl sewing trinkets, or sewing machine items, etc. Choose a country or region. Collect sewing items made or designed from your country during the decades. After the 60s, many items are made overseas, so the \"designed in\" aspect might become more important for your collection. Commemorative items. Some sewing items were produced for commemorative purposes. This category might be ideal to base your collection on, provided it is in an area of sewing items that were used for commemorative items, such as thimbles. Alternatively, just collect everything you come across and can afford. Beware though, as this can result in indiscriminate collecting and you will end up with pieces of very little value crowding out the more valuable pieces. It depends on your display space and memory!"
