These materials are all machine-washable, but double check the care label to confirm that it\u2019s okay to put the shirt in the washing machine. If the label says \u201cMachine Wash\u201d or has a symbol with a bucket filled with water, go ahead with putting it in the machine. If you see a bucket with an X over it, or the words \u201cDry Clean Only\u201d or \u201cDo Not Wash,\u201d then bring the shirt to the dry cleaners. Usually, wool and silk aren\u2019t machine-washable. You might also see \u201cHand Wash Only\u201d on the label. In this case, hand wash the shirt instead of putting it in the machine."
