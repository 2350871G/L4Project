If you try to get out of inviting your friend\u2019s new partner you\u2019re iffy about, you might have an awkward moment on your hands. Children under 18 can also be addressed on the same invitation as their parents. For children over 18, it\u2019s usually best to send a separate invitation. If they live with their parents, you can get away with including them all on the same invitation. Similarly, siblings or other people living together but not in a relationship can be invited together. However, you might find separate invitations to be a more thoughtful gesture.

Miss is used for single women and girls under 18. It\u2019s a little complicated, so taking care of this before you start writing can be a great relief. Ms. is a catch-all address. It works well for unmarried women over 30 and anytime you\u2019re unsure about what title to use. For medical doctors, you must spell out the word doctor. Other doctors get the abbreviation \u201cDr.,\u201d which replaces Mr. and other prefixes.

Your hand is cramped, but persevere for the good of your wedding day. Lost envelopes won\u2019t make their way back to you without a return address. The upper left corner is the standard spot for your full and unabbreviated address. To avoid cramping the front side, you may write it on the back flap. The stamp can go back there too to give your handwriting space to shine. Printed address labels, while not as appealing as handwriting, are an option. It\u2019ll give you more time to spend on the important decisions, such as what kind of frosting to use on your cake (like chocolate or more chocolate). If an invitation is returned to you unopened, it most likely means you have the wrong address. Addressing the Invitation and Response Cards Mention close friends by first name only. Referencing first names is a sign of intimacy and should only be done with people you know well. It\u2019s tempting to do it with everyone, since it saves you a lot of writing, but that would be uncomfortable for your boss, teacher, or uncle you never met. Reserve it for good friends and other people you\u2019re on a first name basis with. For example, write out \u201cHarry and Ginny.\u201d\nFamilies can be listed easily like this. You can write, \u201cNed, Catelyn, Robb, Miss Sansa, Miss Arya, Bran, and Rickon.\u201d\nInitials are never a valid substitution for a name, but suffixes like Jr. and Sr. are always appropriate. Address most people by their last names. The bad news is that you\u2019ll have to do more writing, unless you hired someone to do it for you. The good news is that you get to be slightly less formal. Instead of writing first and last names, the inner envelope only contains the last name behind the salutation. Don\u2019t forget special honors such as Dr.\nFor example, write \u201cMr. Potter and guest\u201d or \u201cMr. and Mrs. Potter,\u201d depending on the relationship. List unmarried names separately. Everyone who isn\u2019t married gets the honor of having their own line. Hey, it doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing. Doing this gives both names equal weight. Order the names again by familiarity, or, for equal familiarity, by alphabetical order. For example, write out \u201cMiss Granger.\u201d Under it, write \u201cMr. Potter.\u201d List each person invited to the wedding. This is an important step when you intend on inviting whole households. The inner envelope is the point where you have to list every name, including children under 18. If your family received an invitation that listed your parents but left you out, you\u2019d be confused. You weren\u2019t verbally invited, and it would be awkward if you showed up unwelcome. Note the adult names first, such as \u201cMr. and Mrs. Ned Stark.\u201d Under that, list the children by seniority. For instance, write \u201cRobb, Miss Sansa, Miss Arya, Bran, and Rickon.\" Girls under 18 are denoted as \u201cMiss.\u201d Boys under 18 don\u2019t get a title. How unfair! Address the return envelopes. These are the envelopes your guests need to return their responses. Giving people zero excuse for not RSVPing will at least save some of your hair when you start pulling it out over planning this big event. Write your name, house number, street, town, state, and zip code in the center of the envelope. To save a whole lot of time, get pre-printed envelopes. You\u2019ve written enough names and addresses for one day.
