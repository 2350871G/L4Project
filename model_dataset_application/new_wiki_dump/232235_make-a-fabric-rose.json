If you cut your flower shapes around 4\" wide, a 2\" inch wide circle will do. Place a dot of hot glue in the center of the circle. Place the first flower shape. Fold one of the flower shapes in half. Place the edge of the flower on the dot of hot glue so that when the flower is unfolded it is centered on the circle Glue the rest of the flower shapes. For each of the other flower shapes, place another dot of hot glue in the center of the flower, fold the flower shape in half, and place it on the hot glue. Rotate the base slightly in between gluing each flower shape so that the shapes aren't aligned. Stop before you use the last two of your flower shapes. Add the final petals.

Making a Button Rose Gather your materials. For a rose with a button in the middle, you'll need at least a foot of fabric, a hot glue gun, and something to put in the center (like a button, a pin, or a small gem). Cut your petals. Cut out 12 petal shapes out of the fabric. Make 6 about an inch long, and 6 a little less than an inch long. Pinch and glue the petals. For each petal, pinch the base and put a dot glue to secure it like that. Glue the large petals to a base. First, cut out a small circle from the fabric for the base of the rose. Then glue all of the pinched bases of the petals to the center of the circle. The circle you use for the base should be something around 1\" to 2\" wide. Glue the smaller petals on. Glue each of the smaller petals on to their larger counterparts. Be careful not to burn yourself with the glue. You can either glue the petals directly over the large petals or you can place them so that they point out at a different angle. Add the button and a pin. Glue the button or other center piece to the middle of the rose. If you want, you can attach a safety pin to the back of the flower to use it as a brooch.",
