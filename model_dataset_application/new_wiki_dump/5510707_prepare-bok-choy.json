Young bok choy is tender and delicious. Most bok choy is fairly limp, compared to heftier lettuces and other greens, so that's not necessarily a sign of quality.

This should loosen all the individual leaves and let you examine, clean, and prepare them individually. Don't discard the tender inside leaves. Those are the best-tasting part of the bok choy.
