Making a popsicle stick catapult requires a few supplies. 7 popsicle sticks\nRubber bands\nA bottle cap from a gallon jug (milk jug)\nHot glue gun\nSmall objects to launch like cotton balls or marshmallows Create the base of the catapult. Stack 5 popsicle sticks on top of each other making sure they are neatly stacked. Use a rubber band on each end to secure the sticks on both ends of the stacks. Make the arm. Use the remaining two popsicle sticks to make the arm. Stack the two sticks on top of each other and secure them on one end with a rubber band.

Glue the cap to the end of the popsicle stick as a basket to hold your projectile. Try out your catapult. Place a projectile in the bottle cap to be launched. Gently pull back the arm of the catapult while holding the base for stabilization. Let go of the arm and the projectile will launch into the air. Angle the catapult to shoot in different directions.
