  "text":" Decorating with Simple Ribbon Bows Form a loop. Take a six inch length of ribbon and overlap the two ends by about half an inch so the ribbon forms a loop. Flatten the loop. Press down on the center of the ribbon to flatten the loop, then take a threaded needle and run it through the center of the ribbon, from the back to the front. Make the bow shape. Fold the center of the ribbon accordion-style, then wrap the thread around the center of the bow several times to tighten. Knot the thread and cut off any extra. Make the center knot. Take a new piece of ribbon and tie a simple, loose knot. Place this knot over the center of the bow to cover up the stitches, then secure the two ends at the back of the bow using a little hot glue. Attach to the headband. Use the hot glue gun to attach the bow to the headband. Decorating with Corker Bows Gather your equipment. To make corker bows, you will need several lengths of corker ribbon, a selection of \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) wooden dowels, some wooden clothes pegs and a needle and thread. Wrap the ribbon around the dowel. To start, secure one end of the corker ribbon at the end of a wooden dowel using a wooden clothes peg. Then start wrapping the corker ribbon tightly around the dowel until you reach the end. Secure with another clothes peg. Bake the dowels. Do this for as many pieces of ribbon as you like, then place the ribbon-wrapped dowels on a cookie sheet covered in aluminum foil and bake in the over for 25 minutes at 275 \u00b0F (135 \u00b0C). After 25 minutes, take the dowels out of the oven and leave to cool completely. Unwrap the ribbons. When the ribbons have cooled, remove the clothes pegs and gently unwind the corker ribbon from the dowels. The ribbon should form a tight curl which holds its shape. Cut the corker ribbon into three inch pieces and lay them out in a row. Stack the corker ribbon on the needle. Take a threaded needle with the knot tied about three inches from the end. Start threading the pieces of corker ribbon onto the needle. Stack the pieces on the needle, don't push them down onto the thread just yet. Thread the needle through. When all of the pieces have been threaded (or there's no more room on the needle) push the bunch of corker ribbon all the way down the thread, until they are sitting on top of the knot. The bring your needle around the back and run it through the corker pieces a second time. Secure the corker bow. Grab the loose thread under the knot and bring it to the top of the bow. Use both ends of the thread to make a tight double knot. This will secure the corker bow. Use a hot glue gun to attach the corker bow to the headband. Embellishing with Crystals, Pearls and Beads Gather your materials. Grab a selection of your favorite embellishments, such as pearls, sequins, crystals, jewels, beads, buttons and even strips of lace. You can find a vast array of options at your local craft store. Find a wide plastic headband, preferably one with a fabric covering as this will allow the embellishments to stick better. You will also need a hot glue gun. Mark the headband. Try the headband on and mark a spot just above your ear on both sides. You don't want to embellish past this mark, or the headband will be uncomfortable to wear. Start gluing. Take your hot glue gun and start attaching the embellishments - you can completely cover the headband for an over-the-top, runway look or keep it a little more simple for understated glam.

Take three different colors or patterns of duct tape, as you will be using them to make a layered bow. Cut a long piece of duct tape. Cut a long piece of duct tape, about a foot to a foot and a half in length, depending on how big your want your bow. Fold the tape. Fold the tape in half lengthwise (so you are halving its width, not its length), leaving just a tiny bit of the sticky part exposed. Now fold the sticky edge over. This will give your clean edges on both sides of the bow. Fold the length of duct tape into thirds. Grab the two outside thirds and fold them in half. Now bend the two lower halves towards each other so they meet in the middle, and bend the two outside halves outwards to form a bow shape. This is very difficult to describe in writing, so it's best to look up \"Make a Duct Tape Headband\" on Youtube to get a visual. Secure the bow. Cut off another small strip of duct tape and wrap it around the center of the bow to secure Make two more bows.

Use a scissors to trim the long pieces of duct tape, cutting them at a 45 degree angle. Decorating Fabric Headbands Use fabric paint. A nice way to decorate fabric headbands is to use fabric paint. You can either decorate them free style or use fabric stencils. Fabric stencils allow you to paint letters onto the fabric, so you can spell out cute words like \"Love\" or \"Star\" or \"LOL\" or even your name. Just cover the stencil in the fabric paint and press it firmly onto the headband. Use a small paint brush to carefully fill in any gaps in the paint. To add a little bit of glitz to the headband, you can shake some glitter onto the fabric paint while it's still wet. Attach feathers. A cute and easy way to decorate a fabric headband is just to attach a bunch of colored feathers. Take a selection of three feathers and hold them at the stems. Fan the feathers out slightly. Use a a dab of hot glue to attach the bunch of feathers to one side of the fabric headband, just above where your ear will be. If you like, you can glue a large sequin or pin a brooch over the stems of the feathers to cover them up. Attach felt flowers. You can make some simple but cute flower attachments for a fabric headband using felt. Take a square of felt and trace out a flower shape (using a stencil of necessary). Trace out two more flower shapes, each one slightly smaller than the last. Sit the smallest flower inside the medium flower and the medium flower inside the biggest flower and use some hot glue or a couple of basic stitches to secure. Glue a crystal, button or pearl into the center of the flower, then glue the flower onto the headband. You can leave it at a single flower or you can make more to cover the entire headband. Alternatively, you can just cut the tops off of some fake plastic flowers and glue those to the headband instead.",
