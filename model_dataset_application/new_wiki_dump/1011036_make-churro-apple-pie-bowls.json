  "text":" Making the Churro Bowls Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0 Fahrenheit or 225\u00b0 Celsius.  Grease a muffin tray by flipping it on its side. Instead of spraying non-stick greasing spray in the cases of the tray, grease it on the sides of the cup. The churro bowls are made onto the cups of the muffin tray. To prevent it from sticking, it must be sprayed on that area. In a medium-sized saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Combine the sugar, water, vanilla extract, and salt into the butter. Mix well with a wooden spoon and allow it to simmer for about 5 minutes. Fold in the flour and continue to mix well with the wooden spoon. Mix well until the mixture begins to turn into a sticky-like mixture and forms into the shape of a ball. Shut off the stove and remove the dough from heat.

This may take a bit of mixing but is normal. Crack in the other egg and mix once more. Repeat with the first egg, mixing until the egg has fully incorporated into the dough. Spoon the churro dough into a pastry bag.

This lets the churros to come out crispy and slightly crunchy once baked. Bake the churro bowls. Allow the churro pastry to bake for about 35-40 minutes depending on the size of the bowls. They should come out golden brown once they have fully baked. Allow the bowls to cool and cover with cinnamon sugar.  Making the Apple Pie Filling In a medium-sized saucepan, fold the apples and lemon juice together. Set aside for later use. In a separate medium-sized saucepan beat together the water and cornstarch. Mix well until the mixture doesn't have any lumps. Place the saucepan over medium heat to heat up for three minutes.  Add in the nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar to the mixture. Whisk well to combine the ingredients together. Bring the mixture to a boil and continue to whisk. Keep mixing until the mixture gradually starts to thicken. Fold in the diced apples and fully combine them into the mixture. Lower the heat and cover the saucepan with a lid. Allow the apples to cook covered until they're soft.
