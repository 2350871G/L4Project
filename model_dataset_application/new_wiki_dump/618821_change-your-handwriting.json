Holding your hand in the air, mostly use your forearm and shoulder to write large letters in the air. This practice will help you feel what muscles you should be using when you write. Move to smaller letters in the air. Use paper. When you first move to paper, try simple strokes like circles and slashes. Keep them as evenly spaced as possible, while still using the muscles in your arm."
