Squirt in about 1\u20133 US tbsp (15\u201344 mL) of mild dish washing soap, and then place your pan inside the water. The soap will cut through the grease and food debris. Alternatively, rinse your pan thoroughly, squeeze in some soap, and fill the pan with water. Then, sit your pan in your sink for a few minutes. This is a good idea if you don\u2019t have major food residue on your pan. When cleaning Circulon pans, it is best to use mild dish soap, rather than harsh cleaners.
