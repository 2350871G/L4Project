Build 4 to 6 barracks, then with only one Shift+Click and all barracks selected, you will have 20 or 30 skirmishers that will fight for you. The resources go away fast, but you can pump out troops really fast and it's also useful to build a fast defense, if your enemy is attacking you."

To support your musketeers against other infantry, build some cannons. They will shoot all the enemy infantry away and your troops get a better survivability. You can not specialize your troops on one unit. To attack successfully, you will need everything. Some units more than others."
