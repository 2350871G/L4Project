You want to beat the margarine until it\u2019s nice and fluffy, so take your time. This will get you the best texture for your frosting."

          "description":"Once your margarine is nice and fluffy, it\u2019s time to add the icing sugar. Don\u2019t pour it in all at once, however. Slowly add a bit of sugar and then whip it fully into the margarine. Then, add a bit more. Continue adding just a little at a time until the icing sugar and margarine are thoroughly blended together."

          "headline":"Add the vanilla and non-dairy milk.",
          "description":"Once the icing sugar and margarine are fully combined, add in your vanilla. Mix this in. Then, evaluate the consistency of the buttercream frosting. You may need a couple tablespoons of your non-dairy milk or you may not need much at all. You don\u2019t want your finished buttercream frosting to be overly dense, but you don\u2019t want it to be runny either! If you want chocolate buttercream frosting, add your cocoa powder now. The amount of cocoa powder depends on how chocolatey you want your frosting, so pour in a portion at a time and do regular taste tests."

          "description":"You can use your frosting right away. If you have leftover frosting, or if you simply aren\u2019t ready to use yours, pop it in the refrigerator. Once you decorate your baked goods, you will want to keep those in the refrigerator as well so that the icing keeps how you want it. You can save your frosting for 3-5 days in the refrigerator."

You can use soy milk, rice milk, almond milk, cashew milk, and so on \u2013 just make sure you can imagine it\u2019s flavor in a frosting. For example, soy milk\u2019s aftertaste might not work as well as vanilla cashew milk\u2019s. Choosing your milk is a matter of personal preference."

          "description":"The great thing about this vegan buttercream frosting recipe is that it can be used as a base for a variety of different flavors. For example, adding a bit of fruit juice can transform it in both taste and color. If you are using it to decorate, you can add a few drops of food coloring to create any color you like. Don't be afraid to get creative with your flavors. Add a few drops of peppermint oil for peppermint frosting. A little bit of strawberry jelly will make fruity, pink frosting. If you want, you can even chop up your favorite vegan candy and put it in your frosting for a little bit of crunch. Experiment!"
