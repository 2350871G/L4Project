          "description":"Hold your phone with a firm grip when you go to take a picture. If your camera is wiggling too much, you won\u2019t be able to get a clear shot, which will make your images look blurry. Instead, try to keep your phone at a steady, consistent angle whenever you\u2019re photographing in the dark. Take several pictures at a time to reduce your chances of only capturing blurry pictures."

          "description":"Look around to see if there are any lights nearby, like street lamps or city skylines. If you\u2019re indoors, try and turn on a lamp or nearby light to eliminate some of the darkness and shadows in your pictures. Portable sources of light can also work well for photos. If you\u2019re near a busy road, car headlights can be a great source of light in a pinch."

          "description":"Take steps forwards whenever you try to get a clearer shot. When you only use the phone lens to zoom in, then you\u2019ll end up degrading the quality of the photo. If you\u2019re trying to get a landscape shot, try moving to higher ground, so you can capture more in a single picture. If you\u2019re trying to take a selfie with a group of friends, have your tallest friend hold the phone camera."

Now that there\u2019s a muted light shining in the immediate vicinity of your camera lens, try taking a picture of something close by. Make sure that the napkin doesn\u2019t end up in the picture. If you\u2019re taking pictures with a friend, ask if they can shine a napkin-filtered light on a nearby object with their phone. This way, you can focus solely on taking the picture with your own camera!"

If you have an Android phone, tap on the \u201cManual Camera\u201d button in the camera application to access the exposure settings.

If you have an iPhone, use apps like PS Express and Filterstorm Neue to sharpen your images and get rid of any extra noise and grain. If you\u2019re an Android user, search for apps like Procapture and JPEG Optimizer. There are also camera apps designed for taking pictures at night.

When shooting active movement (e.g., an animal, a person running) in dark areas, aim to keep your shutter speed at a 1/200 second setting or higher (e.g., 1/500). If you\u2019re shooting stationary objects, feel free to lower the shutter speed even more (e.g., 1/100). Try not to use automatic settings when taking pictures in the dark. Shutter speed determines how much light enters a photograph. If your camera has a long exposure time setting, then more light will be able to get into the picture."

Set up your tripod in an area with a clear view of your surroundings, and attach your camera to it. Don\u2019t start taking pictures until your camera is fully secured to the tripod. Low shutter speed photos are best taken on a tripod, and not from a handheld camera."

Test out different settings to ensure that your pictures aren\u2019t too noisy or grainy at a higher ISO setting. If you\u2019re comfortable with editing out noisy photographs, feel free to increase your ISO level even more. Look at your sample photos on a computer to get a better idea of how noisy and grainy your pictures look. ISO settings refer to your camera\u2019s light sensitivity.
