If you find you still are having a hard time cleaning off some of the food inside, you can repeat the microwaving with the same cup or bowl previously used, or dip your cloth or towel into the cup or bowl and use some of the hot Lemony or Vinegar water to wipe the food off. It should help to loosen any areas that are being stubborn. Use the hot lemon or vinegar water to clean the turntable in your microwave, the edges on the inside, the outside, your oven top and your sink...lemony fresh, no chemicals, very inexpensive, and very environmentally friendly!"
