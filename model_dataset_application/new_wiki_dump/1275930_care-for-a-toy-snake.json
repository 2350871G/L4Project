      "description":"This will be its water bowl/saucer. it should be big enough where the snake can fit in it, when coiled. And it should not be deep. DO NOT put real water in it unless the toy snake is waterproof. You could put those clear \"rocks\" that people put in fish tanks in the bowl, pretending it is water."

      "headline":"Give your pet snake a place to hide.",
      "description":"Snakes MUST have a hide. Some examples are: Half a coconut, a log, a paper towel tube (if the snake fits in it when the snake is coiled), or even one of those little cloth bags. Keep in mind at how big the snake is, because it needs to be able to fit inside of the hide when the snake is coiled."

      "headline":"Put some good-sized rocks (two or three) in the box.",
      "description":"Because snakes like to sit on rocks to get warm, and when it it is sunny, rocks get warm. If you don't have any smooth rocks for your snake to sit on, you can use a folded piece of cloth (e.g, a handkerchief) for your snake to sit on."

      "headline":"Once the box is completed, name your toy snake.",
      "description":"It can be a normal name, like \"Sam\", or an exotic name, like \"Zeus\". You might want to name the snake based on it's features, (e.g, for a black snake, it's name could be \"Midnight\", \"Shadow\", or \"Ebony\".) Think about it's gender. Make up a personality for the toy snake. If the snake is feisty and mean, its name could be \"Demon\". If the snake is nice, and likes to be handled, its name could be \"Sugar\". Or name it a human name, like \"Robert\", \"Bill\", or \"Mary\"."
