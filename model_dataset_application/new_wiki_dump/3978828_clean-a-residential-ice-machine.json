  "text":" Removable ice maker Determine if the ice maker is completely or partially removable. If removable, you'll be able to clean it as follows. Run the ice maker through two or three freezing cycles. If the refrigerator has a built-in water dispenser, then a longer flush is required to flush the water reservoir. Remove the ice storage bin, ice maker unit, and any other removable components.  Wash in hot soapy detergent solution.  Rinse in clean potable water.  Sanitize the parts in a solution of 1 ounce unscented household bleach in 3 gallons (11.4 L) of clean potable water. Leave the parts in solution for at least 30 seconds. Let the parts air dry. Wash your hands thoroughly. Reassemble the unit and return the ice machine to service. Discard the first ice produced.  Let the bin or reservoir fill and run bacteria samples on water supply and ice. If negative, the ice can be used for food operations. If positive, re-clean and sanitize machine and check for problems with the potable water supply. Non-removable ice maker Run the ice maker through two or three freezing cycles. Alternatively, flush the water supply line including the water dispenser and water reservoir. Discard the ice and return the ice bin to the freezer.  Use a spray bottle with a chlorine solution (1 ounce household bleach to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water.
