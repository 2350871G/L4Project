      "description":"There are many different species of reclaimed wood indigenous to the American landscape, and all have different qualities. Also, there are many different construction techniques that are time tested methods and styles. Often the choice of the style of furniture helps to dictate the type of wood used.

      "headline":"Always kiln dry reclaimed barn lumber (or any lumber for that matter).",
      "description":"The process of kiln drying involves stacking lumber on 1\"x1\" sticks in bundles, in an airtight room. Once the lumber is in the \"kiln\", heat is added slowly until the ambient temperature reaches around 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C). While the lumber is being heated, it is releasing moisture. Where does that moisture go if the room is airtight? In order to dry reclaimed wood properly to be used for your furniture, you have to have a commercial dehumidifier to draw the moisture from the wood and essentially dry it. Most species of reclaimed wood have an equilibrium moisture content of around 6-8%. It is crucial to get the wood to this moisture, because if it is higher than this, the wood still has moisture inside, that will cause the wood to shrink once in climate control."

      "headline":"If you do not have access to a Kiln then you can air dry the lumber by stacking it on the 1x1 sticks in an area with decent air flow.",
      "description":"This is a much lengthier process than kiln drying but will accomplish the same thing. You want to get the lumber to a moisture content under 12-15%. You will also have to treat the lumber for insects as well. The kiln drying process is also required to kill the bugs and micro-organisms inside reclaimed lumber. The recommended process to eliminate insects is to heat the core of the wood to 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C) for 4 hours."

The rule to woodworking is to anticipate wood movement. Wood will expand and contract from season to season, so never ever ever attempt to try to keep wood from moving. Always allow for movement, and your furniture will look great for generations."

      "description":"If building multiple tables at a time, use a spray gun to apply finish. It is not only faster, but it is much easier and less messy. If you do not have a spray gun, you can hand apply most finishes unless they are catalyzed. Try low VOC commercial grade lacquer. You can also use hand rubbed tung oil before you spray, with pretty good results, although the oils can sometimes take 4 or more applications to actually get a sheen. Once you have completed your finish, a nice wax coat is the icing on the cake. Try steel wool with #0000, and rub the wax in, let stand, then buff out."
