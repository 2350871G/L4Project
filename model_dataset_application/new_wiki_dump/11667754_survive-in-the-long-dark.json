          "description":"When you start a new game of The Long Dark in any difficulty other than Interloper, you will be given a choice of regions you can start in, which will greatly affect the initial difficulty of the survival experience. For new players, it's likely best to start in one of the three regions below. Mountain Town has plenty of buildings to loot, but more predators than some of the other regions. It also doesn't have any fishing, eliminating one potential food source. Mystery Lake has a moderate number of structures and low predator density, and is a good choice for new players. Coastal Highway has milder weather than either Mountain Town or Mystery Lake and plentiful looting opportunities, but parts of the map, especially near the Quonset Garage, tend to have a high population of dangerous animals."

          "description":"Do you see a building around you? Head for that. It is highly likely that it will contain some items which will prove helpful. At this stage you will likely have very little gear, and anything you can find will prove important. If you see a cave, head for that. Caves often contain some loot, though less than buildings."

          "headline":"Take everything in the building.",
          "description":"Almost anything you find will have some use or other. Don't bother breaking down furniture yet as it takes a very long time. Make sure to search all the nooks, crannies, and containers. Sometimes useful items can be very well hidden in a dark corner. Clothes are not equipped by default. To put on clothes, you'll have to go into your \"clothing\" interface (usually by pressing F), and then selecting the appropriate article of clothing."

Below this is a \"Condition\" bar, which represents your health. This bar will start to deplete if your character's needs meters run out. If your Condition ever reaches zero, your character will die and your saved game will be lost. Temperature will fall if your \"feels like\" temperature is below 0C. To stay warm, head indoors, get out of the wind, find better clothing, or build a campfire. Freezing will deplete 20% of your condition each hour, so staying warm is the most pressing need. Rest will be depleted by being awake, but walking and especially sprinting depletes it faster. To rest, you'll have to sleep, which will also restore lost Condition over time. Hydration can be restored by drinking various beverages. Hunger can be restored by eating foodstuffs. If you keep your food over zero for 72 consecutive hours, your carry weight will increase by 5 kg."

          "description":"For the rest of the first day, you will want to find as much stuff as possible. Be sure to keep your bars up as you do so. Freezing for up to an hour on the first day is fine, as the lost condition will be easily restored by a night's sleep. If you are getting too cold, either enter a building or start a campfire to warm up. While you're waiting, consider fixing some of the clothes you're wearing (requires cloth or leather and a sewing kit)."

If there are few moments of daylight left, use this time to fix damaged clothing, or tear up excess clothes into cloth. For this first night, almost any building will do, as long as your \"feels like\" temperature is above freezing when you're inside. Try to avoid sleeping in a vehicle, as it is likely going to be too cold unless you found excellent clothing earlier that day."

Potable water can be found in toilets, or obtained by melting snow and boiling the melted water using a fire. However, this requires a recycled can or cooking pot."

The first three can be found in any region, while timberwolves will only be found in Bleak Inlet. The simplest way to avoid encounters with hostile wildlife is to give them a wide berth. Wolves, bears, and timberwolves will hunt you down, and are drawn by scent. Pressing [TAB] will show a HUD with your scent. Stay downwind from them to avoid being sniffed out. Moose won't hunt you out, but will attack if you get too close. Be careful exploring caves that contain skeletons, as these are often inhabited by bears."

If you exhaust yourself by needless sprinting, you may be unable to sprint when you seriously need to in a dangerous situation."

          "description":"The base you used on your first night was likely adequate for surviving one night, but some locations in the game are better than others for long-term survival. Camp Office and Trapper's Homestead are popular choices in Mystery Lake. Both have a workbench and stove. Camp Office is located more centrally, however there is a slight chance of encountering a wolf when entering/exiting. In Mountain Town, the Milton House, Orca Gas Station, and Pleasant Valley Farmstead make good bases. The farm has an outdoor workbench nearby, but can be frequented by wolves. The Milton House is centrally located and a good starting point for looting the entire town, whereas the Orca Gas Station offers good hunting opportunities, but frequent wolf encounters. The Quonset Garage is a very well-stocked location for long-term survival in Coastal Highway, but is frequented by wolves, and occasionally a bear or moose. Jackrabbit Island doesn't have an interior fireplace, but has plentiful rabbit trapping and very few predators. Other popular locations in other regions include: the Desolation Point Lighthouse, the Farmstead and Thompson's Crossing Community Centre in Pleasant Valley, the Hunting Lodge in Broken Railroad, and the Ice Caves in the Hushed River Valley."

Additionally, walking on live electrical wires can cause life-threatening burns. A flashlight can scare wolves if used on high beam. They also will not enter brightly lit areas under street lights."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Do not carry too much.",
          "description":"If you exceed your weight carry limit, you will become encumbered. Depending on how encumbered you are, this will increase your risk of sprains on sloped ground, prevent you from climbing ropes, and can even render you immobile under extreme conditions. To avoid this, don't bring along heavy items (i.e. Hunting Rifle, excess kerosene) if you won't need them and are only going for a short trip. If you're within carry weight, this is most desirable, but can be difficult to achieve without the Moose-hide satchel or the Well Fed benefit. 0-5 kg overweight: Generally OK for exploring, as long as rope climbing is not required. 5-10 kg overweight: You will be slowed down somewhat, but can still sprint. For longer trips, this is probably the maximum weight that's safe to carry. 10-15kg overweight: You will be unable to sprint, but can still walk decently. Adequate for short supply runs around your base if it's in safe, level terrain. 15-20kg overweight: You'll become very slow; carrying this much is only worthwhile if you've just killed an animal very close to base and are bringing it home. Carrying more than 20 kg over the limit makes you extremely slow and should generally be avoided, unless you're moving things around inside your base."

If at all possible, do not travel, hunt, or explore unless conditions are favorable for doing so. Blizzards especially are very dangerous, and can result in your becoming disoriented and freezing to death just meters from your front door. Stay home when one strikes. If weather conditions start to deteriorate while you're out exploring, make finding shelter your top priority."

You can also craft the pelts of hunted animals into clothing, if required. Hunting is easiest with the Rifle, though it can be done with the Revolver or Bow too. The recommended tactic is to sneak up to the animal you're trying to kill, aim, and fire at its head. Beware that bears and moose will charge and attack you if harmed and are best hunted from a safe area, such as a hunting blind. Rabbits can be caught using snares, which can be crafted from reclaimed wood and cured guts. Make sure to check the snares every day, or else a predator may claim your prize. Fish can only be caught in an ice fishing hut. You'll need something to break open the ice fishing hole (bring a prybar, hunting knife, heavy hammer, etc.) and fishing tackle to catch the fish."

Timberwolves aren't afraid of torches or flares, but will avoid campfires and marine flares. Throwing a lit marine flare at aggressive timberwolves repeatedly will break their pack morale and cause them to leave you alone for a time.

Beware that wolves will immediately charge if a firearm is aimed at them. Repeated shots at or near Timberwolves will lower their pack morale. Killing one of the pack members will lower it even more. Do not shoot a firearm if near a bear or moose. Bears will walk over to investigate gunshots, and will charge you if shot at. Moose will also charge if hurt.
