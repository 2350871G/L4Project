  "text":" Working Left to Right Wrap the thread behind the needle, from right to left, forming a loop.  Grasp the needle with your right hand and draw it through the loop.  Carefully draw the needle through the loop and tighten the knot. This forms the first stitch or knot. Insert the needle to the right of the first stitch.  Loop the thread around the needle again, left to right, then behind the needle and right to left.  Repeat until you have a row of stitches. Now look carefully at the stitches. You will see loops of thread between each knot. These loops are used for working the next row of knots. Working Right to Left Insert the needle under the first loop.  Wrap the thread in front of the needle, from right to left, and then behind the needle, from left to right, so that it forms a loop.  Grasp the needle with the right hand, draw the needle through the loop, and tighten the knot.  Insert the needle under the next loop of the previous row, wrap the thread around the needle, and draw the needle through the loop to form the stitch. ",
