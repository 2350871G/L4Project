Try alternating a full glass of water with every drink of Jager you take. The water will slow down the dehydration process and keep you from getting too drunk. Understand that because you are drinking so much water, you will be running to the bathroom quite frequently. The more alcohol you drink, the less water you will remember to consume. Drink a couple glasses of water before you start drinking alcohol to help level the playing field. If a room is especially warm, you may find yourself dehydrated sooner rather than later. If you\u2019re sweating more than you normally do, drink even more water to avoid becoming too drunk."
