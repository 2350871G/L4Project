Pending trades are trades that are still active, either waiting for your action or your counterpart\u2019s action. These are trades that you need to watch closely because there may be new ones appearing that may need your attention. You wouldn\u2019t want to miss out on a good deal!

Ideally, the cards being exchanged are of the same or close value. Since the game is about collecting cards, some players may put more value on their cards over yours. Watch out for these types of trades as you may be left at a disadvantage. If you don\u2019t like a trade offer, it\u2019s okay to decline."
