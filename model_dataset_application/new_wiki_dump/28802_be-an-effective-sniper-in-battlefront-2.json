Therefore, start by eliminating the snipers. Many of them will be in predictable sniping spots (see the Tips section). If your team is using vehicles, then try to aim for the anti-tank units. If the battle is close-quarters, you should aim for the engineers. Otherwise, simply eliminate enemy soldiers."

Pros: Powerful, fast rate of fire. Does not leave a trace to you. Kills target wherever you hit them on. Cons: Short range. If you are too far away the beam won't even hit the target. Lower ammo supply, and you cannot zoom in twice like with the original sniper rifle. All together, it works as a close-range sniping rifle, but the best bet is the original rifle."
