Chop the cauliflower into chunks while you heat a sauce pot with a little water in it. Set the cauliflower inside a steamer basket and place it in the pot. Cover the pot and steam the cauliflower until it's very soft. It should take 10 to 12 minutes for the cauliflower to become tender."

The mixture should be completely smooth. The softer your cauliflower is, the smoother it will be once you puree it. This is why it's important to steam it until it's completely tender."

Stir in more of the biscuit dough ingredients with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until the mixture is completely combined. You'll need to mix in:\n1/3 cup (95 g) of nonfat Greek yogurt\n1/2 cup (50 g) of shredded cheddar cheese\n2 eggs\n1 teaspoon of kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon of black pepper"

Beat the egg whites for a few minutes, so they become stiff. Gently fold the egg whites into the cauliflower mixture. To fold the egg whites, hold a spatula and carefully use a twisting motion with your wrist to combine the cauliflower mixture with the lighter egg whites. The goal is to maintain the volume of the egg whites."

Bake the biscuits for 20 to 25 minutes. They should brown and look a little crisp around the edges. Let the biscuits cool on a rack until they're cool enough to handle and serve. Consider using a small cookie scoop to fill the muffin cups. You could also just use a few small spoons to scoop the dough."

It should come out easily in a circular shape, although you may need to tap down hard to get the dough to fall out. Continue portioning out the dough into biscuits. You should end up with about 12 biscuits on the sheet. If the dough is sticking to the cup, you can dip the cup in some almond flour."
