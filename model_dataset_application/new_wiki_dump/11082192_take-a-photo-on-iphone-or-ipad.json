There are four picture modes:  Photo, Portrait, Square, and Pano. Photo and square are straightforward to use, but pano works a little differently. Photo mode takes a slightly cropped picture. It is designed to fit the screen of the original iPhone, as well as the iPhone 3G(S) and iPhone 4(S). Portrait mode allows you to take a picture with a blurred background. This mode requires an iPhone 7+, iPhone 8+, or iPhone X and later. Taking a Portrait photo isn't any different from taking a regular photo, since the blur is applied automatically. Square mode takes a picture with the aspect ratio of a square. Pano mode takes a panorama. More on that later in this article."

  "text":" Taking Pictures Open the camera. Swipe the lock screen to the left, or swipe up into the action center and choose the camera icon.

The timer allows you to take a photo after a specified time period. You can set a timer by tapping on the timer button and choosing \"Off,\" \"3s\", or \"10s\". Enable colored filters if you want to. These can be accessed by tapping on the three circles. Your filter options will appear under your photo display. You can scroll between and choose from a set of eight filters or remove the filter if you want to. The flip camera button is located next to the shutter. This flips the camera between the forward and rear facing camera. Take a photo once the settings are ready. Tap on the white circle to do so. To take a burst, hold the circle down.

Check out the picture you took. To open the Camera Roll (where your photo was stored), tap on the square in the corner of your screen. Taking a Panorama Open the camera. Swipe the lock screen to the left or swipe up into the action center and choose the camera icon. Alternatively, open the camera by searching for the app on the home screen and tapping it. Make sure the camera mode is on \"Pano\" and that your phone's screen is upright on portrait mode (not landscape). To change the camera mode, swipe on the screen until you see \"Pano\" highlighted in yellow along the bottom of the photo screen. Choose the direction of the panorama. To do so, tap on the arrow to change it from right to left or left to right. Tap the white button. This will start taking your panorama. Turn in the direction of the arrow, slowly. While doing so, make sure that you keep your phone steady and on the white line. Adjust your stance/hands up or down as needed to keep the arrow aligned with the line. Tap on the white button to stop. If the panorama reaches its maximum size, then the panorama will automatically stop. Choosing Between Burst Photos Open Photos. This app has a multicolored pinwheel on it. Tap on the photo/burst you took.  Tap on Select\u2026.  Select your favorite photos. You will know if the photo is selected if you see a checkmark by it. Tap on Done. Choose whether to keep the burst or only the few photos. If you keep only the selected photos, you will not be able to access the whole burst later.
