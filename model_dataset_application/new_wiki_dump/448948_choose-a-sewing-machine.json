If you're purchasing the machine at a department store such as Kmart or Walmart, this is likely what you are getting. $200-$600: Average machines which will do well for the occasional seamstress, but will not hold up well long term if you are doing a lot of sewing. (i.e. more than once a week)  Good name brands in this price range are Singer, Bernina, White, Janome etc. These machines can occasionally be found in higher end department stores such as Sears or JCPenney. $700 to $2000:  Machines in this price range tend to last longer because they are made from better materials and are engineered better. They also have much better availability of replacement parts for repair. Most good brands will have machines in this price range as well as in the average price range. Mid-range to higher-end Baby Locks, Bernina, Viking Husqvarna, Janome, Juki, Pfaff and a few higher end Singers can be found in this range. Machines in this range are generally not available in department stores and must be purchased either from a sewing shop or online. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/3\\/34\\/Long-Arm-Quilting-at-Olde-City-Quilts-7581.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/3\\/34\\/Long-Arm-Quilting-at-Olde-City-Quilts-7581.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":392,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":647.9,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image from: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/8149289@N04\\/981090818\\\">Flickr<\\/a> <br>Taken by: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/people\\/8149289@N04\\\">adiything<\\/a><br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-sa\\/2.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}  A long-arm quilting machine. $2000 and up: Machines used by tailors, seamstresses, upholsterers and others who use their machines on an almost daily basis.

The serger, or overlock, machine is another type of specialty sewing machine.
