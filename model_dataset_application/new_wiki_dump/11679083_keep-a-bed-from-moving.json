Make sure the rug is large enough so that all 4 legs of your frame touch it.Tip: An area rug can help tie a room together, especially if you match it with the theme of your bedroom. If you don\u2019t have 1 large area rug that you can use, you can put 4 smaller area rugs underneath each leg of your bed frame. You can also use rubber pads instead of an area rug for an all-black option."

Place your bed in the corner of the room with the head against one wall and 1 side against another wall. This should stop your bed from sliding as it hits the wall on either side. This positioning can be slightly irritating if there is more than 1 person sleeping in the bed, since 1 person has to be close to the inside wall."
