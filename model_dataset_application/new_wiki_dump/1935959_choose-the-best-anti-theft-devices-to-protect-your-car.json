      "headline":"Consider an electronic immobilizer.",
      "description":"Many modern vehicles come standard with car keys and fobs that protect their cars via electronic immobilizers. These built-in transponders or microchips send signals to the anti-theft system, which then send a signal that it's ok to start the car. When anyone attempts to use the car without these signals, the car will not start. Car thieves often avoid cars with electronic immobilizers."

      "headline":"Install a \"Kill Switch.\"",
      "description":"This anti-theft device can be activated to shut down part of the engine's electrical system. Some cars have them built in, and they are pretty easy to install. Price Range: Low End: $10, High End: $200. A popular model is the Master Lock Starter Sentry, which kills the fuel or ignition system via a wireless transmitter. Other ignition kill switches are activated the moment a car is locked and cannot be deactivated until a series of tasks are completed (i.e., unlocking the car, pressing the gas pedal once, buckling your seat belt, etc.). Always check your car's warranty first, because some don't allow installation, and remember to hide the Kill Switch, so a thief won't see and disable it."

    {
      "headline":"Invest in a car alarm.",
      "description":"These are the most visually effective anti-theft devices. Sometimes drawing a potential thief's attention to the fact that your car has an alarm system is enough to deter them. So, be sure to put a sticker in the window, on both sides, proudly proclaiming you have a car security system activated. Car alarms feature electronic sensors designed to activate when a vehicle is breached:  unauthorized entry, breaking of glass, sudden movement, and perimeter violations. When a threat is detected by the sensors, a siren activates (at over 120 dBs), alerting the car's driver and everyone else within earshot. Price Range: Low End: $150, High End: $1,000. Be wary of older, cheaper car alarms, flexible-circuit alarms, and single-stage sirens, which are too easily triggered, and may come at the expense of your neighbors' friendship. Always hook your car alarm up to a backup battery and/or invest in a hood lock. Many car thieves know how to unplug a car alarm's battery, which will silence it. Even if you don't have a car alarm, you can buy & apply stickers proclaiming your vehicle is protected by an alarm. The thought of a security system should make any thief choose another victim!"

      "headline":"Try VIN Etching.",
      "description":"Every vehicle has a unique, 17-digit serial number assigned to it called the Vehicle Identification Number or VIN. The VIN will be on the car's title, on the dashboard (driver-side), and on your insurance and registration cards. You can \u201cbrand\u201d your car's parts by etching it's VIN number on all windows and all important parts. Doing this serves as both a tracking device and a theft deterrent. Most car thieves steer clear of etched vehicles because of the expense in replacing and disposing of VIN-coded glass. Price Range:  DIY kits sell for $20, or you can hire a professional to do this for you."
