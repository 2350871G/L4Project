  "text":" Phyllo Pastry Replace your usual pastry with phyllo pastry. This pastry is very low in fat compared to other pastry types. Use approximately 8 to 10 sheets of phyllo for the pie topping. Instead of brushing each layer with oil, only brush with milk (dairy or soy). If wished, you can brush the top layer with olive oil to assist browning and crunchiness. Place the brushed layers over the top of your pie. The beauty of this solution is that it still works for either a savoury or a sweet pie. Cook according to your recipe's instructions. Keep an eye on the pastry, however, to make sure that it is not browning too quickly. Reduce the oven temperature slightly if this happens. Low Fat Pastry Dough Sift the flours, salt and baking powder into a bowl. A lot of the wholewheat will stay in the sifter; this can be pushed through a sieve or simply added back in as is, whichever you prefer. (The sieve pushing will make it finer, not doing this will leave a rougher texture.) Add the oil and milk to the sifted ingredients. Mix in well. Let the resulting dough stand for 30 minutes in a cool spot. During this time, the gluten in the flour will lose its elasticity, so that the dough won't shrink when baked.
