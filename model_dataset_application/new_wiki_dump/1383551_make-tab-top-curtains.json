For an extra-large window, you may want to consider multiple curtain panels. When you're taking your widthwise measurements, be sure to divide the final number by the number of panels you want before cutting your fabric. For instance, if you need 30 feet (9.1 m) to cover a window and you want three separate panels, each panel must be 10 feet (3 m) wide (30 \u00f7 3 = 10)."

For instance:\nTo add a bit of privacy without blocking out too much light, choose a lighter weight material that has some transparency, such as voile or linen. To block out light or drafts, choose a heavier material, such as velvet, corduroy, tapestry, or damask. For an ultra-lightweight curtain in areas where you don\u2019t need privacy, try lace, chiffon, or organza."

  "text":" Measuring and Cutting Decide how many curtains you need. For a small window, you may only need one curtain to cover the whole thing. However, if you're covering a larger window, you may want two curtains that part in the middle. For an extra-large window, you may want to consider multiple curtain panels. When you're taking your widthwise measurements, be sure to divide the final number by the number of panels you want before cutting your fabric. For instance, if you need 30 feet (9.1 m) to cover a window and you want three separate panels, each panel must be 10 feet (3 m) wide (30 \u00f7 3 = 10). Choose a fabric. You have a lot of choices when it comes to choosing fabrics for curtains, but you should take into account what kind of effect you want to achieve.

To block out light or drafts, choose a heavier material, such as velvet, corduroy, tapestry, or damask. For an ultra-lightweight curtain in areas where you don\u2019t need privacy, try lace, chiffon, or organza. Measure and calculate the width of the fabric. Measure the width of the window you're covering from the outer edge of the frame on one side to the outer edge of the frame on the other side. Multiply that by two or 2.5, depending on how full you want the closed curtains to look. Then add another four inches (101 mm) for the side hem. If you are making multiple panels, add four inches (101 mm) to each panel for the side hem. Measure the gap between the curtain rod and the window frame. Measure from the top of the curtain rod to the very top of the window frame. This is important because you want to ensure your curtains completely cover the top of the window. Therefore, when hung over the curtain rod, the finished tabs must be shorter than this gap. Measure and calculate the length of the fabric.

For instance, if you have a finished curtain of 30 inches, and you want tabs spaced at every five inches, you need seven tabs for that curtain (30 \u00f7 5 + 1 = 7). Calculate the length of your tab facing. When you sew the tabs on your curtains, you'll be left with a raw edge that you'll cover with a piece of facing. To make this, cut out a piece of fabric that\u2019s four inches (101 mm) wide and the length of your curtains plus two inches (51 mm). Measure and cut your fabric. Once you have all your measurements and calculations, you can cut your fabric to those dimensions and begin sewing. Don\u2019t forget to cut out the curtains, the tabs, and the tab facing.

This will leave you with tabs that are two inches by eight inches (203 mm), and folded tabs that are four inches (101 mm) long. Sewing the Curtains Sew the tabs. Fold each tab in half lengthwise so that the right sides (the good sides of the fabric) face each other. Pin the sides in place, and use the sewing machine to sew a straight stitch along the lengthwise edges of the fabric. Use a half-inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance, and don\u2019t forget to backstitch at the beginning and end of every new seam. Press the seam open with a hot iron, then turn the tab right-side out. Position the seam in the center and press the whole tab flat. Hem the side seams. On each side of the curtain, fold the edge over (wrong sides together) one inch (2.5 cm) and press it in place. Fold this over another inch and press it again. Sew the hem at a three-quarter-inch (1.9 cm) seam allowance, and press it when you're finished. Attach the tabs to the curtain. Measure out the desired spacing for your tabs, marking where the center of each tab will go with a fabric marker or chalk. Fold the tabs in half (with the seam on the inside) and place them upside down on the curtain, lining up the raw edges of each tab with the raw edge of the top of the curtain. Pin the tabs in place. Sew each tab to the top of the curtain using a half-inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Prepare the facing. Fold the side (widthwise) edges of the facing over one inch (2.5 cm) and press them in place. Then fold up the bottom (lengthwise) edge one-half inch (1.27 cm) and press them. Attach the facing to the top of the curtain. Lay the facing right-side down over the curtain top and the tabs, lining up the raw edges. Pin the facing in place and sew along the top at a half-inch (1.27 cm) seam allowance. Open up the fabric at the seam and press the tabs and the facing upward. Then fold the facing piece down behind the curtain and press it again. Pin it in place, and top stitch around all the edges. Hang the curtains to check the hem. At this point, it\u2019s a good idea to hang the curtains in case you need to adjust the length of the hem at all. Take the curtains down when you have finished checking. Sew the hem. Fold the hem up four inches and press it in place. Fold that up another four inches and press that too. Position the edge of the presser foot along the top edge of the fold and top stitch the hem. Hang the curtains. Once you're happy with the finished product, you can get your curtains up and decorating your window!",
