Ironing Layer several pieces of kitchen paper towel or brown paper, or a terry towel rag over the wax stain. Prepare a bottle of mineral spirits and a bucket of dish detergent and warm water, at the ready. The towel rag will absorb more wax than the paper, but use what you have available. Heat the iron on a hot setting.  Iron over the paper. The wax will melt underneath. Remove the heat and the paper layers. Quickly mop up the melted wax using paper towel or rags and the mineral spirits. Remove the mineral spirits with the detergent and warm water. Mop it all up and allow to dry. Repeat if needed.  Hair dryer Prepare the cleansers. Have a bottle of mineral spirits and a bucket of warm water with detergent at the ready. Use a putty knife or similar scraper to remove as much wax as possible.
