LED lights come in either fixed lengths or in a strip that can be cut. They reduce energy costs and do not require replacement bulbs. They last up to twenty years. Fluorescent bulbs are long-lasting and energy-efficient, but they are harder to conceal. Incandescent bulbs produce a soft, yellowish light and are the most inexpensive option. Their lifespan is short, and they aren't bright enough for utility lighting. Halogen bulbs are bright and shine completely white. They create much more heat than other bulbs, but they also last twice as long as incandescent bulbs. They are more expensive than fluorescent or incandescent. Xenon bulbs are similar to halogen bulbs, but they last longer and radiate less heat."

Remove the old electrical box. Make sure that any wiring connected to the old electrical box is loose before removing it. Pulling out the box when the wires are tight will damage the wiring. Once you are sure that wires are loose, remove the old box by using a flat pry bar. Running Cable Find the knockout in the back of the light fixture. A knockout is a pre-scored hole made to run wire easily without drilling extra holes. Take out the knockout plug or plate. There might be a plug or plate in the fixture\u2019s knockout hole. Use a screwdriver to either pry the plug loose or unscrew the plate. Plan where you will drill. Before drilling a hole in the wall so that you can run cables, you need to plot the spot.

Clearing the fixture will give you space to screw the fixture into the cabinets. Place the light fixture. Put the fixture where you plan to install it. Make sure it is lined with the edge of the cabinet or behind it. Attach the light fixture to the cabinet. Screw the fixture to the cabinet using the screws the manufacturer provided in the kit. Place a cable clamp in the fixture\u2019s knockout hole. Insert a \u00bd-inch nonmetallic cable clamp in the fixture\u2019s knockout hole to hold the cable in place and protect it from damage. Unscrew the plate that locks the clamp and place the clamp in the knockout hole. Once the clamp is in place, screw the plate back into it from the outside of the fixture. Run the cable into the fixture. Grab the cable hanging from the small hole in the wall and run it into the knockout hole of the fixture. Strip the cable. Use a wire stripper to remove the coating around the end of the cable that's in the fixture. Once stripped, connect the exposed wires to the corresponding wires in the light fixture: black-to-black, white-to-white, and bare copper to green. Do this by twisting orange wire connectors to the ends of the wires. Reattach the cover and socket strip on the light fixture. Make sure all the connections are secure and that there is no exposed wired. Once you reattach everything back to the light fixture, staple the cable to the cabinet using cable staples. Place the light bulbs you selected into the socket strip on the fixture.  Installing the New Outlet Run the cables into the new electrical box. There will be two sets of cables: the cable that ran into the old electrical box and the cable you ran from the light fixture. Pull both cables through the new electrical box. Place the electrical box into the hole you created in the drywall. The fins on the outside of the box should rest firmly against the wall so that you can screw it in securely. Screw the electrical box into the wall. The box has fins that flip inside the wall when you screw it. Make sure you feel the fins flip as these secure the box to the wall. Use a GFCI outlet. A ground fault circuit interrupter outlet will help prevent dangerous shocks that could seriously injure or kill someone. Once installed, this outlet ground-fault circuit interrupter will shut off instantly if the circuit shorts or is overloaded. Connect the wires from the new outlet to the cables in the electrical box. Use wire strippers to remove the insulation on the cables. Once the wires are exposed, strip on the insulation on them as well. Connect the corresponding wires using an orange wire connector. Use a green pigtail connector to combine the copper wires from both cables and the outlet. Screw the white and black wire into the GFCI outlet. Make sure you combine the black and white wires from both cables and the outlet. Once they are combined, screw the free end of each of these wires into the corresponding terminal on the outlet. These terminals will be labeled \u201chot-wire line\u201d and \u201cwhite-wire line.\u201d Connect the dimmer or light switch. If you are installing a light switch into the outlet, connect the yellow wire from the switch to a black wire coming from the light fixture cable. Attach the copper wire from the switch to the copper wire on the GFCI outlet. Connect the white wires together. Make sure you use cable connectors to combine all wires. Tuck in the wires. Once everything is connected, carefully pack the wires into the electrical box. Screw the outlet and switch to the electrical box. Screw the GFCI outlet into the electrical box. Once the outlet is secured, screw the wall plate into the electrical box. Turn the power back on. Once everything is secured and connected, turn the power on by flipping the kitchen switch at the circuit breaker.",
