You can fade several lanterns at once. Use the Preset A Master to fade your set-up on Preset A.  Look at the two Preset Masters. When Preset A is at 10, Preset B is at zero. Set up the change of lights you want on Preset B.  Slide the two Preset Masters together and your lights in scene 1 (Preset A) will change to the Lights in scene 2 (Preset B).  To use the Fade time knob (above the Preset masters), turn the knob to the desired time and slide the two Preset Masters smartly. If you set the knob at 5 seconds, your two presets will cross fade from one to the other for 5 seconds. The maximum fade time is 5 minutes which is perfect for a slow sunrise. Look along the bottom of the desk and you will see a row of flash buttons.  Activate the flash buttons by pressing the Flash Master (an LED light should come on). Now when you press the buttons, the appropriate light will flash on momentarily. To create a sequence or chase:  Press and hold down the sequence button for a few seconds until the LED comes on.
