          "description":"Water-soluble stains are potentially the easiest stains to fix, as they're often vulnerable to the effects of water. These include food dyes, soda, milk and most alcoholic beverages, among many other things. First, you'll want to dab a washcloth or paper towel with some warm water. From there, place the towel firmly atop the stain. The warm water will help soak up part of the stain. This is best done as soon as possible. It'll be harder to soak up the stain once it dries."
