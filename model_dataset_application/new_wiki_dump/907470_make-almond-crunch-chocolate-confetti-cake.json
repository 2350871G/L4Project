Stir the nuts with a wooden spoon to loosen them from the baking sheet.  Bake until golden, another 5 to 8 minutes.  Remove from the oven and immediately stir the nuts to loosen them from the baking sheet. They'll become crisp as they cool. Set aside.  Making the Cake Heat the oven to 325\u00baF/160\u00baC.
