This makes it much easier to pull the towel out of the closet when you need it, grabbing it by the fold instead of the edges so it doesn\u2019t come undone. Stack other hand towels on top with the folded edge facing out. Folding a Decorative Pocket Lay a hand towel on a flat surface with the tag facing upwards. Spread the towel out so that it\u2019s situated horizontally. Check to make sure the tag is on the side of the towel facing you so that it doesn\u2019t show up in the fold. Bring the far left edge of the towel one-fourth of the way to the right side. Take the left edge of the towel and fold it in towards the center one-fourth of the way.

Make the folds carefully to ensure the smaller fold doesn\u2019t come undone. Align the edges so the towel is straight and flat. Lift up the top pocket fold and tuck it into the fold directly beneath it. After the hand towel is folded into thirds, it\u2019ll be long and horizontal with the original side fold on the left. Hold up the flap and stick this flap into the flap right under it. Smooth out the fold so that it\u2019s flat and even. Bring the far right side of the towel to the left side to fold it in half. This will create a vertical fold in the middle of the towel. Gently press down on the left side of the towel as you\u2019re folding the right side over to make sure the pocket doesn\u2019t come loose. Align the edges of the towel to make sure your fold is even. Hang the towel with the pocket facing you. When you go to hang the towel on a rack, place the towel so that the center fold is right on top of the rack. The folded pocket flaps should be facing the wall with the finished pocket facing you.
