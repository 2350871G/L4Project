          "description":"When you knock over a candle or get wax on the carpet, your clothes, or another piece of fabric, you must give the wax time to dry before you can clean it. Otherwise, you risk pushing the wax deeper into the fibers if you try to wipe it up when it\u2019s wet. Wax doesn\u2019t take long to dry. For small amounts, the wax will be dry in a couple of minutes. For larger spills, you may have to way 15 to 20 minutes. To speed up the process, apply an ice cube to the affected area to dry the wax faster."

Avoid spreading the loose wax flakes around as much as possible, as this could make cleanup more difficult. On fabric, peel the fabric away from the back of the wax to dislodge the larger pieces."

This will prevent wax from melting into the carpet in a larger area when you go to remove it. Instead of vacuuming fabrics, take the material outside and shake it out to remove loose wax pieces."

Once hot, apply the iron to an inconspicuous area of the fabric or carpet for 30 seconds. Remove the iron and inspect for damage, melting, or warping. During the test, remove the iron immediately if the carpet or material starts to smoke, smells like burning, or begins to melt."

You can also use a single layer of a white or brown paper bag if you don\u2019t have paper towel. Just make sure there's no ink, wax, or printing on the bag.

Don\u2019t use steam settings to heat the wax, as it will soak the paper towel and prevent it from absorbing the wax.

Direct the hot air at the wax spill and apply gentle pressure to the paper towel with your other hand. You may have to use the blow dryer instead of the iron for materials that can melt, such as synthetics like polyester, faux fur materials, and other polymer-based fabrics."

For non-washable materials like carpeting, spray the area with carpet cleaner and blot it with a clean cloth until the area is clean and dry. After you remove the wax from the area, there may still be colorant or residue left on the material, and that\u2019s why washing is necessary."
