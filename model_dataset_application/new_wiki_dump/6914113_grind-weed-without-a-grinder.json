Then, place the scissors down into the weed buds and start cutting. If you\u2019re using a shot glass, it\u2019s okay to use a small pair of scissors like nail scissors or mustache scissors."

Since the coin will move around the container as you shake it, you don't need to worry about its placement. Wash your coin or sanitize it with hand sanitizer, alcohol, or vinegar. This will keep germs from getting on your weed."

If it\u2019s not, put the lid back on and shake the bottle for another 1-2 minutes. Continue shaking it until you're happy with the size of the pieces. Depending on how thick your weed is, it can take a while to get your desired size. Expect to shake the container for at least 5 minutes. This method is safe and grinds effectively, so it\u2019s a great option for every day grinding."

If they aren't, continue to grind your weed for up to 5 seconds at a time until you're happy with the size of the pieces. Check it frequently so that you don\u2019t accidentally grind it too finely. Clean your coffee grinder thoroughly after you grind the weed so that your coffee won\u2019t be spiked with THC.Tip: A coffee grinder is designed to grind coffee into a fine powder. However, weed is hard to use if it's ground down into a powder. Instead, you want your weed to be a little bigger than dried herbs typically are."

Lift your blade and move it over about 1 mm, then slice into the weed again. Continue cutting the weed until you reach the other end. If you think the pieces are still too large, rotate the cutting board so that you can easily slice the weed in the other direction. Then, make a second pass to chop it into smaller pieces.
