You can puree prunes or dates and add them in place of sugar, or reduce the amount of sugar and add prunes or dates instead. Other dried fruits you can use are raisins, apricots, berries, or cherries. Try making date paste by soaking dates in water for around three hours, and then putting them in the food processor. Make sure to get natural dried fruits. Do not get candied dried fruit or dried fruit that contains added sugar. This defeats the point."

However, you can't use honey in a recipe where you need to beat butter and sugar together. This leads to denser baked goods. Many people believe honey is not a good substitute for sugar because it breaks down the same in the body, so you really aren't improving anything.

You can't use maple syrup in any recipe where you need to mix butter and sugar. You can use less maple syrup than sugar in recipes. Maple syrup has less calories than honey, so it may be a better option."
