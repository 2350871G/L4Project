          "description":"Buy a candy mold from a craft store or online and put your melted candy melt into a clean squeeze bottle. Slowly squeeze the candy melt into the center of each cavity and stop filling once it's 3/4 full. Once you've filled all of the cavities, gently tap the mold on the counter to release air bubbles and help the candy melt spread to the edges of the cavities. Set it aside so the candies harden and then turn them out.Tip: If you're making candy, you'll need to buy at a few bags of candy melt from the grocery store, craft supply store, or online. If you overfill the cavities, the candy melt will create a circle behind the candy detail. To speed up the hardening time put the mold into the freezer and chill the candies for 10 minutes."

          "description":"Although you don't have to use melted chocolate or white chocolate as a base, your bark will have better flavor. Spread melted chocolate or candy melts over waxed paper and spread it thinly. Then scatter your choice of sprinkles, chocolate chips, dried fruit, or chopped nuts over top. Once the bark hardens, break it into rough pieces.Did You Know? You may be able to find flavored candy melts, such as salted caramel, chocolate mint, or birthday cake. Experiment with different flavors. For example, use birthday cake melts and scatter mini-marshmallows along with sprinkles over the top. For festive bark, spread chocolate mint melts and scatter chopped candy canes on top."

Stir in 1 to 1 1/2 cups (125 to 190 g) of chopped nuts or pretzels and then scoop the mixture onto a waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Let the clusters harden completely before you serve them.

          "description":"Decide if you'd like to make chocolate ganache truffles or if you want to use the candy melt. If you use the candy melt, pour the melt into a shallow pan and refrigerate it until it hardens. Then use a small scoop to roll the mixture into 1 inch (2.5 cm) balls. To coat the truffles, dip them into the candy melt and set them on waxed paper to harden. For an extra special look, drizzle your truffles with a different color of candy melt. For example, drizzle white over the chocolate coating or pink over the white. If you prefer, roll the dipped truffles in finely chopped nuts, sprinkles, or shredded coconut."

Slowly pipe the candy melt into the lollipop cavities and tap the mold on the counter to release trapped air bubbles. Set lollipop sticks into each cavity and set the mold aside so the lollipops harden. Once you become more experienced at working with candy melt, use different colors to make bright lollipops. Look for lollipop molds in unique shapes. For example, use heart, star, or flower-shaped molds to create lollipops for special occasions."

Make the candy melt shard as long as you like and let it harden before you take it off of the parchment paper. Then squirt a little frosting on the base of the shard and attach it to your frosted cake.Variation: Instead of melting the candy melt, stick the candy melt buttons to an already frosted cake to create some texture. Try making small shards to decorate the tops of cupcakes. Avoid using a paintbrush that you've dipped in real paint before. Only use a new, clean paintbrush."

Then use an offset spatula or knife to spread the melt over the tops of the cookies. If you'd like more control over decorating the cookies, put the candy melt into a piping bag and pipe it onto the cookies. You can also put the candy melt into squeeze bottles.

Cut the brownies or treats into bars and set them on a wire rack. Then drizzle your choice of candy melt over them or dip half of each bar in the candy melt. Place it back on the wire rack to set up completely. Consider shaking festive sprinkles over the bars after you've drizzled or dunked them in the candy melt. For example, drizzle green and red candy melt over the brownies and shake snowflake sprinkles over them for a holiday dessert."

You can also dip pretzel sticks, buttery crackers, or sandwich cookies in the candy melt. Set the dipped food on a piece of waxed paper and let it harden.
