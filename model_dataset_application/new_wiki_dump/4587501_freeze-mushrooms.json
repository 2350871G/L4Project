          "description":"While steaming may preserve more flavor in frozen mushrooms, blanching or parboiling will still keep the mushrooms fairly high quality for up to 12 months, although experts disagree on the effects of exposing mushrooms to water. This method requires no equipment other than a pot of water and a heat source, and the mushrooms will stay tasty for up to a year in the freezer afterwards. This method is especially useful if you intend to use the frozen mushrooms for soup, since the slightly soggier texture will go unnoticed."
