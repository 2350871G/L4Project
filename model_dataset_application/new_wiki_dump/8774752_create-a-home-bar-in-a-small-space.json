If you have a furnished basement, it\u2019s a great spot for a bar. If you entertain in your living room, set your bar up there. It\u2019s also easy to set your bar up in or near the kitchen so you have access to water. Bar carts will be explained more later, but these allow you to set the bar up anywhere. Bar carts are versatile because you can change which room the bar is in each day, if you want to."

Clear two or three shelves on a bookshelf in the bar area. Use one shelf for drinks, one shelf for glassware, and one shelf for extras like shakers or an ice bucket. For an existing bookshelf, leave the rest of it full of books or anything else to add a bit of atmosphere to the bar area.

The benefit of an armoire is that you can open and close it as needed. When the bar is not in use, close it up so it looks like any other piece of furniture."

Make sure you choose a cart with at least two levels, one for alcohol and one for glassware. Bar carts are easily moved, so it\u2019s possible to set up a bar for a short time and move the cart when you don\u2019t need it anymore. Move it out to the patio or deck for summer cookouts. If possible, be sure to choose a cart that comes at least up to your waist. You and your guests don\u2019t want to have to bend over to mix up a drink."

Make sure is out of the primary walking path of the room. Choose a bar or an island that has the counter space you want and also has some storage under the counter. You\u2019ll find many options to fit the decor of the room. If you use a TV tray for the bar, you\u2019ll want to have some kind of shelving or cabinet nearby for extra storage space."

Leave the lid open and stock it with as many bottle and glasses as you can. This can be set out on an island for display or can be your whole bar. Take out any upholstery or straps so you have only the suitcase shell. This will make it easier to store everything you want.
