If you own the thermal carafe Bunn model, you will need to take apart the decanter periodically in order to thoroughly clean the lid. You can remove the lid by rotating it counterclockwise.

Keeping the Brewer Clean Unplug the coffee maker. Prior to cleaning, you should always unplug the coffee maker. This will ensure that you don't accidentally turn on the machine and heat the vinegar or water that is used for cleaning. Pour one quart (1 L) of vinegar into the brewer. Make sure that the funnel and pot are securely in place. Then, pour one quart (1 liter) of white vinegar into the top of the brewer. This is the same place that you normally pour water when brewing a pot of coffee. Let the vinegar drip through the brewer. The vinegar will begin to slowly drip through the coffee funnel and into the pot. Once the vinegar has completely stopped dripping, you can empty the decanter into the sink.
