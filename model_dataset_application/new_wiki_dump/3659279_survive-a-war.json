          "description":"Unfortunately, your home may become unsafe in the event of a war. If your area is no longer safe, do your best to relocate and find another place to live. Where you end up settling depends on the progress of the war. Stay updated on the fighting and try to discern which areas haven\u2019t been touched by the war. Try to find areas that aren\u2019t near the main fighting. These could be rural areas or strategically unimportant towns. There may be designated civilian safe zones set up. Travel to one of these if there is one nearby. Rural areas may be safer because fighting is often focused around cities and population centers. However, remember that you\u2019ll need wilderness survival skills to stay safe here. It may also be more difficult to receive aid, since relief organizations also focus on cities."

          "description":"These buildings types can withstand the most damage and remain standing. Look especially for a building with a basement. This provides added protection and a hiding place if you have to stay out of sight. Search your area for suitable buildings like these and move into one as soon as possible. Try to find a building that you can seal up in case there is a chemical leak or attack. Look for windows still intact that you can close and block off with damp towels. If there are multiple suitable buildings in your area, make a list of all of them and their locations. This will help if you have to flee your current shelter and find a new one quickly. If there are no buildings like this, then find any structure that has a basement to protect you from the fighting."

          "description":"If you flee the cities and hide in the woods, your biggest enemy will probably be the elements. Construct a suitable shelter as soon as you enter a new area to protect you from the cold, rain, and sun. Maintain this shelter by fixing any problems right away. Locate the shelter in a spot that's easy to hide in, just in case hostile people pass through the area. To make the job easier, try to build your shelter around an natural feature. A fallen tree, for example, could provide the support for a structure."

          "description":"While a war probably makes you think of fighting, in reality, civilians usually survive a war by avoiding fights as much as possible. Unless you\u2019re in the armed forces, in most cases you\u2019re much safer avoiding confrontations. Lay low and don\u2019t start fights with people. Take care of your family, friends, and yourself, but try not to get involved in problems that don\u2019t affect you. If hostile troops enter your area, it\u2019s best to hide or avoid interacting with them at all costs. Make it clear you aren\u2019t a threat. Don\u2019t try to steal from people or hurt anyone except in self-defense. This will lead to confrontations eventually, because desperate people will defend themselves. Avoiding fights may also mean fleeing an area that is unsafe. Always be ready for this possibility to keep yourself and your loved ones safe."

If not, then gather any weapons you may find and learn to use them. Keep them close at hand in your shelter in case you have to use them. If you have a gun, ammunition might be scarce in a survival situation. Shooting for practice may also draw attention to you. Learn to use the gun as well as you can without firing if you've never used it before. Don't neglect other potential weapons like bows, axes, bats, or knives. These can all help you fight off attackers. Train other members of your family or group to use the weapons as well. Your group is at a disadvantage if only one member knows how to fight."

If someone tries to hurt you or your loved ones, or steal supplies that you need to survive, fight back when you can. Try to drive off the people who are trying to hurt you. Having some weapons at hand will help in this situation. Keep all weapons in a safe place, away from children, and grab them quickly if you need them. If you do have to defend yourself or your family, having a good personal relationship with your community is a big help. The community could unite to defend itself from bandits or other people who want to cause harm."

Take all of your valuables, money, food, and water and store them safely. Hide valuables so even if your home is searched, they won\u2019t be stolen. If you're able to, go out and get as many supplies as you can. Don\u2019t delay or everything could be gone by the time you need it. Especially store your canned or wrapped food and bottled water. Save these resources for emergencies, in the event that clean water and fresh food become scarce. Look for medicine and hygiene products as well. These are important for maintaining your health in stressful situations. Remember to store all of your important documents as well. Hold onto birth certificates, marriage licenses, Social Security cards, and any other documents that prove your identification. This is especially important if you have to flee your country. Other countries may prevent you from entering if you can\u2019t demonstrate your identity and family relationships. Withdraw money from the bank to have cash on hand. You may not have access to your bank electronically."

As soon as the war starts, find all of the potential water sources in your area. Do the same for every new area you move into. Nearby lakes and streams are potential water sources, but you may have to purify the water before drinking it. If you live near the ocean, do not drink saltwater. It's difficult to resist, but saltwater will cause serious illness. If you do find a clean water source, use that and try to preserve your bottled water for emergencies. If no other water sources are near you, collect rainwater for drinking and bathing. Leave out buckets and tubs to catch the rain when it falls. Remember to purify all rainwater before you drink it."

Once you get news that war has broken out, gather as many canned and nonperishable items as you can. Get them from the store or any other source you come across. This ensures you\u2019ll have a steady supply if food starts running out. After the war has been going on, canned items may be available in abandoned grocery stores. Whenever you find an unopened can, take it. You don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll come across more food. Try to avoid foods with high salt content that will make you thirsty. These will make you drink more water than you would normally. Ideally, you should have 3-days\u2019 worth of nonperishable food in your home at all times in case of natural disasters or other emergencies. If you have a stockpile already, you can avoid the rush to the food store that will occur once the war starts."

Also practice fishing for a steady supply of nutritious fish. Both skills can help you get through times of food shortage. Learn how to properly skin, bleed, and dress an animal so the meat doesn\u2019t go bad before you can eat it. You don\u2019t have to be in a rural area to hunt. There are plenty of animals in city settings. Try setting up traps to catch small animals."

          "description":"While hygiene may not be high on your list in a survival situation, it is more important than you may think. Practicing good hygiene can prevent illness and infection, and also help you feel better. When you're gathering supplies, always include as many hygiene products as you can carry. Also look for more if you're scrounging or searching for supplies. Important hygiene products to have are toilet paper, hand sanitizer, toothpaste and toothbrush, soap or liquid soap, feminine products, and disinfectant. Less critical but important products include combs or brushes, razors, shaving cream, and deodorant. These won't necessarily save your life, but keeping up a good appearance can help you feel much better in stressful situations."

          "description":"Almost all areas have local plants that may be edible. Knowing which ones you can eat could save your life in a desperate situation. Study your local area and find the plants that are edible. Then gather them regularly for a steady supply of food. If you don\u2019t know what a plant is or if it\u2019s edible, smell it first. If the smell is terrible, it\u2019s a good bet that it\u2019s not edible. Then hold the plant on your skin for 15 minutes and see if you feel any itching or burning. If not, place the plant on your lips for 15 minutes. Then take a small bite of the plant. If you don\u2019t feel any burning or stomach pains after 15 minutes, then the plant is probably safe to eat. If possible, you could also start a garden on your property for extra produce. Try to keep this hidden, though. If food is short, people will almost certainly try to steal your produce."

If you come across supplies or stores that no one is watching or look abandoned, then take everything you need. This might be ethically wrong, but you and your family have to survive. If you live in a populated area, you may come across many abandoned stores. Don't hesitate to search them for supplies and take what you need. If you're on the move, stop and check any buildings you come across. You never know what the previous residents left behind.

This information may be scarce, but there are methods you can use to stay informed. Social media is a great new way to stay informed. Check for updates on Twitter and Facebook from residents of other areas. Use certain keywords or hashtags to find the information you\u2019re looking for.

Foods like these pack as many nutrients as possible into your meals. If you can\u2019t find fresh food, try to find dietary supplements to boost your nutrient intake. These may be available from abandoned stores and homes. Maintaining Your Composure Stay updated on news about the war. Information is critical to surviving a war. Monitor the progress of the war to find out which areas are safe or dangerous, and where you might find resources. This information may be scarce, but there are methods you can use to stay informed. Social media is a great new way to stay informed. Check for updates on Twitter and Facebook from residents of other areas. Use certain keywords or hashtags to find the information you\u2019re looking for. Handheld, battery-powered radios may also be a reliable information source. See if you can pick up any local news stations reporting on the war. Question any outsiders who pass through your area for information. Ask where they came from and if they have any news. Keep up personal relationships with family and neighbors. These personal relationships will help you get through the crisis. Having family members around helps to ease your stress. Protecting them also gives you a purpose, which can drive you to push yourself harder in stressful situations. A network of neighbors can also share food and resources, so treat the people around you kindly. These relationships may save your life. If you move to a new area, introduce yourself to locals. You don\u2019t have to become best friends with them, but don\u2019t remain a stranger. You may have to rely on these people for help if fighting reaches your area. Build a positive mental attitude. In any survival situation, maintaining your composure and ability to think logically is key. Letting despair and grief take over your mind will make logical thinking much harder. This will be especially difficult in wartime, but it\u2019s extremely important to keep a positive mindset. Do all you can to think positively. Developing and refining emergency plans can help you stay positive. It ensures that you\u2019ll always have a procedure in place if something goes wrong. Take steps to reduce anxiety and keep your head clear in stressful situations. Building and maintaining personal relationships can help you stay positive.",
