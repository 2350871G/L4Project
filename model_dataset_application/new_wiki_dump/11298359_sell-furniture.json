          "description":"Community-based websites are the best places to show off your furniture. Try using a site like Craigslist, Letgo, or Nextdoor. These websites enable your advertisement to reach people within your community. It\u2019s the easiest way to advertise to a wide audience. You can list furniture on a few sites to increase the chances of making a sale. For instance, you might write, \u201cSelling an oak dresser with minor scratches on the top but otherwise in good condition. It is 3 years old and used moderately to store clothing.\u201d"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Post an advertisement to social media.",
          "description":"Make a couple of posts on your profile pages explaining what you have for sale and how much it costs. Also, look for community groups in your area. Some social media platforms also have online marketplaces you can use to list your furniture. Focus on pages for communities in your immediate vicinity. You are more likely to sell to someone who doesn\u2019t have to travel far to retrieve the furniture. Look for groups made for buying and selling things. Many areas have groups like this to help people get in touch with one another. Try posting something like, \u201cIs anyone interested in a mahogany wardrobe? It has been sitting in a spare bedroom and hasn\u2019t been used the past 2 years.\u201d"

          "description":"Apartment complexes, community centers, offices, and some businesses have community boards. Type up a clear, colorful ad on a computer, then print it out on basic printer paper. Make copies to pin up around town. Anyone walking by could be the buyer you\u2019re looking for. Always ask for permission before hanging up your advertisement. Contact the business or person in charge of the community board. You could up the flyer to say, \u201cLiving room set for sale, purchased in 2017 and gently used.. It is made with a firm black vinyl that has no noticeable damage.\u201d"

          "description":"Consignment stores offer a place for you to put your furniture on display. The store takes a percentage of the money you get from the sale. Check out used furniture stores if you\u2019re looking to sell to a retailer. You could also try antique stores if you\u2019re trying to get rid of antique furniture. Antique and used furniture stores often have an appraiser who can tell you how much your furniture is worth. They buy the furniture from you and may give you a better deal if you deliver it to the store on your own. Consignment stores pay you when the furniture sells. It\u2019s a good way to show off furniture without having it take up space in your home."

          "headline":"Sell your furniture at a garage or estate sale if you\u2019re having one.",
          "description":"Host a garage sale in your yard to get rid of furniture and all sorts of other goods. Sales are a great option if you have a lot of things to sell. You will need to put the furniture in a visible spot, but good pieces often sell quickly at these sorts of events. One downside of a sale is that only people who live near you may visit. You could also post ads online to ensure more people see the furniture you are selling. An estate sale is a good option if you\u2019re trying to clear out a home, such as one from a deceased family member. For instance, you might have a dining room set to sell. Put a picture of the set on the flyer and write, \u201cCherry dining set with minor chips. Includes a table and 4 upholstered chairs for $500.\u201d"

Include a picture to increase the chances of a sale. Newspaper ads cost money according to the size and number of words used, so discuss the pricing before you pay. Newspaper ads are a good way to advertise inside your community, but keep in mind that it targets a limited audience. Many people look for furniture online. Newspaper ads have to be kept short in most cases. Type something like, \u201cRed leather armchair for sale. Has some small cracks but well-kept, asking price $250.\u201d"

Then, wash off stains by scrubbing with soap and water or a furniture polish. Also, take apart as much of the furniture as possible to clean out the insides. For example, take the drawers out of a dresser and pull the cushions off the couch. It helps with making the furniture look better, but it also ensures you don\u2019t leave anything valuable behind. Some damage is normal with used furniture. You don\u2019t have to try fixing or cleaning permanent damage. Sell the furniture as is."

Once you\u2019re ready to start snapping photos, capture the furniture at a few different angles. Let potential buyers see the pictures so they can get an idea of what you\u2019re selling, even if they aren\u2019t able to see it in person. Take clear pictures of chips, stains, and other problems so potential buyers know what they are getting. Increase the chances of a sale by staging the furniture in your home.

To avoid confusion, separate furniture you aren't selling as a bundle. Your advertisement should clearly display what you plan on selling. Keep in mind that online buyers often click through ads until they notice a good picture. If your photo is confusing, you may have a hard time selling or end up with people who don\u2019t misunderstand what you\u2019re selling. Furniture sets have to be listed together in the same ad.

Subtract another 5% for every year you have owned the furniture. Also, lower your asking price to compensate for marks, dings, and other wear and tear. If you\u2019re unsure what price to set, look around online to see if you can find similar furniture for sale. Keep in mind that antiques and items made from sturdy materials are worth more than cheap furniture. Consider calling an antique store to ask for an appraiser\u2019s opinion on the price."

One of the most common tactics is to drop your asking price a little more to get the buyer to agree to a deal. If you\u2019re not in a hurry to sell, you could reject offers to wait for one you like. Take into account your situation. When you\u2019re in a hurry to move, for instance, you may have no choice but to get rid of furniture as soon as possible by accepting a lower offer. Once you agree to a price, stick to it. Don\u2019t change it when the buyer shows up, but also don\u2019t sell to someone demanding that you lower the price."

Make sure they are prepared to pay for and transport the furniture before you let them in. Have the furniture ready to be moved, such as by putting it in the front room of your home. If you\u2019re able to move the furniture yourself, you could choose to meet the buyer somewhere public, such as a parking lot.
