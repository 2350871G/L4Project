Be sure to turn down your hot water heater to the accepted safety range of 120 degrees to 130 degrees Fahrenheit after your sauna to avoid burns and scalding."

Since you want to recreate the high temperature environment of a sauna as much as possible, choose a bathroom that is in a warmer area of your house if you can."

Other aromatherapy scents that may calm you include rose geranium, chamomile, and clary sage. If you don\u2019t want to deal with candles, aromatherapy oils can be placed in the tub or in a diffuser.
