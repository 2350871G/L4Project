These colors will easily blend in with your surroundings. Even though black seems like a color that would blend in well, it will stick out compared to the rest of woods since it doesn\u2019t occur in nature often. Wear long sleeves and pants so most of your skin is covered and hidden from sight."

You don\u2019t want to have a great hiding spot ruined by a glare! Wear contacts instead of glasses if you can. The sun could reflect from the frames and give away your hiding spot."

          "description":"If you want to completely blend in, rub dirt or mud on your face so your skin doesn\u2019t give away your hiding spot. Alternatively, you can use body-safe paint or ashes from a fire. Camouflage face paint can be purchased at your local hunting or sporting goods store. Be careful near your eyes, nose, and mouth when applying your camouflage. Wrap a scarf or bandana around your face if you don\u2019t want to put anything on your skin."

Find branches or grasses that you can tie on top of your shoulders and wrap around your sleeves to make your form look more organic. Construct a ghillie suit by tying ropes and grasses together. Good camouflage isn\u2019t about blending into your background; it\u2019s about making your form look less familiar."

If anyone comes near you, don\u2019t make a noise so you don\u2019t give yourself away. Many people will not look in plants like nettles or near thorny bushes. Take advantage of these areas while you\u2019re hiding, just be careful not to hurt yourself."

Stay still and silent for at least 10 seconds as you listen to see if you can hear anyone near you. If you see another person, stay completely still. Chances are they haven\u2019t noticed you and you can slowly and quietly duck down to the ground."

Start making another air hole back towards the surface at the bottom of the one you\u2019ve just dug. This helps the fire burn more easily.

Lay logs that are sturdy but you can still lift on the lip around the pit. Cover the logs with leaves and soil to conceal your shelter. This type of shelter allows others to walk over the top of it without them knowing you\u2019re underneath them. Cover the floor of your shelter with leaves for comfort and insulation.
