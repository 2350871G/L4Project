Trumpet vine spreads itself above ground and below ground. Keep the vine from expanding above the ground by immediately removing the new shoots that sprout through the soil. Remove new shoots from your garden and flower bed with your hands. Wear gardening gloves to do this. Pull the new shoots up and out of your garden or flower bed.

Regular mowing helps prevent an old trumpet vine from re-emerging, and also helps stop a new vine from taking off. Mow your lawn once every 7 to 10 days.",
