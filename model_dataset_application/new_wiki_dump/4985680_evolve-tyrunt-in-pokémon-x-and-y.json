      "description":"This is the first level that Tyrunt can evolve at. You can raise Tyrunt's level by fighting other Pok\u00e9mon, or by using Rare Candies. Tyrunt is very effective against Flying, Poison, Fire, and Electric-Type Pok\u00e9mon. Fight Pok\u00e9mon like Pidgeotto, Koffing, Charmeleon, and Pikachu to quickly win battles and raise Tyrunt's level."

      "headline":"Wait for daytime.",
      "description":"In order to evolve, Tyrunt must level up during the day. This can be Level 39, or any level after that. Daytime counts both Morning and Day, so you can perform this evolution anytime between 4 AM and 8 PM. Changing your system's clock to make daytime occur will prevent any time-based evolutions for 24 hours. Pok\u00e9mon X, Y, Alpha Sapphire, and Omega Ruby all follow the same schedules."
