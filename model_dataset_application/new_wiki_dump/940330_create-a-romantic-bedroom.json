          "description":"People have different ideas about what might be a romantic bedroom. For some people, an uncluttered room with a few choice items and art pieces on the wall is much more appealing than a room with more traditional \u201cromantic\u201d decor like lace, tulle, and muted or pastel colors. If you share your bedroom, consult your partner. It needs to be a place that both of you find romantic and comfortable. Some questions that you and your partner might need to think about before you begin:\nWhat is your idea of romantic? Is it overtly sexy, or more cool and understated? Will the room be private, or will people other than you and your partner enter it at times? Do you use your bedroom to work on the computer, watch tv, or other activities that could be done elsewhere? Expert Answer\t\t\t\t\t\tQ\t\t\t\tA wikiHow reader asked: \"How can I set the mood in my bedroom?\" Katherine Tlapa\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInterior Designer\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKatherine Tlapa is an interior designer, currently working as a Design Specialist for Modsy, a design service based in San Francisco.

EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tKatherine Tlapa, an interior designer, answers: \"You can make your bedroom more romantic by using mood lighting. Lighting candles and having secondary lighting like string lights, table lamps, or lamps on a dimmer can help set the mood. You can also layer your bed with fluffy bedding, like soft blankets and pillows, for a comfortable setting."

          "description":"Choosing the best sheets, blankets, and comforters you can is essential for a wonderful bedroom. Think about your color scheme and start looking for bedding. Feel the fabrics -- will they provide the textural feel you want in your bed? Think about what kinds of coverings you want -- whether it will be blankets, a comforter, or a duvet -- and how it might change with the seasons. Do you like the feel of silk or satin sheet? Some people love them, while others find them slippery. Have you tried cotton sheets with a high thread count? These are often chosen by both men and women as some of the most comfortable sheets -- many luxury hotels use them. Do you need a lot of warmth in your blankets or comforters? Or will you be fine with a thin blanket? Think about what you will need year-round. If you like switching out your bedding to match different moods or seasons, consider getting a high-quality comforter and a few duvet covers so that you can change up your looks. Make sure you consult your partner before you invest in any bedding. If you share a room, this is something both of you will use every night, so they should feel comfortable in the bedding, too."

Think about buying the pillows to match your bedding -- either to echo the colors or textures you\u2019ve already chosen. Accent pillows can make a bed more visually comfortable and inviting.

Maybe it just needs to be put into a different location. Don\u2019t clutter up your bedroom with too much furniture. When in doubt, leave it out. Once your furniture is where you want it, you can now place any other items you\u2019ve decided to include in your new revamped romantic bedroom. Be choosy about how much furniture you use in your bedroom. If you do need to include some, consider choosing it all in one style/color to help the room feel put together. If it\u2019s in a variety of colors and styles, think about painting it all one color so that it feels like it goes together. Or if it\u2019s all wood, varnish it all in the same shade. Don\u2019t put too many accessories in your room and take the focus away from the bed. A few focused accessories, such as a rose-embroidered throw pillow or an elegant piece of driftwood, can make a bigger impact than a host of clutter. Try not to include a television or other electronics in your bedroom. Not only do they make it more difficult to sleep, they can severely diminish the romantic nature of the room."
