          "description":"Using a pair of pliers, grab a corner of your carpet. Gently lift the carpet up and towards you, away from the corner. Pulling too hard and fast will only tear carpet fibers from the carpet. If you\u2019re having trouble getting your carpet up with pliers, use a knee kicker to loosen the carpet. Place the knee kicker on the carpet about four inches (eight centimeters) from the area of wall you wish to peel back. Drive your knee into the knee kicker with moderate force. You should see the carpet bunch up against the wall. Grip the bunched-up section with pliers and peel it back. Once your carpet is loose, continue pulling until you\u2019ve removed the area you wish to re-lay. Don\u2019t pull the carpet past doorways or you risk breaking a seam."

Pry the staples up with the pliers, then drive the flat edge of the screwdriver beneath them to pop them out. Use care so as not to tear the pad. Do not try to pull the pad up without removing the staples. The pad will rip. Signs that your carpet should not be laid again include an uneven surface, wrinkles, and a crinkling sound when it is walked on. If your carpet pad was installed over concrete, it will likely be glued in place and impossible to re-lay in another space. If you still want to remove it, pull away as much as possible and use a flooring scraper to remove any bits that stick to the concrete."

Remove tack strips that you cannot use again by wedging a pry bar beneath them, then pulling up on your end of the bar. If the tack strips are lodged in concrete and you wish to remove them, you will have to pull the tack strip up through the concrete nails. Once the tack strips are removed, strike the concrete nails with a hammer from the side to break them off. To protect your hands, wear heavy protective gloves before attempting to remove tack strips. Cracked or deteriorating tack strips should not be reused. If the tack strips have been down for 10 years or more, it is probably best to replace them."

They should be placed about one centimeter (half an inch) from the wall. Position them in such a way that the tacks are angled slightly toward the wall and facing up, then secure them by hammering the pre-started nails that come installed in the tack strip. You\u2019ll likely need to cut the tack strips at some point to accommodate the size of your room. For instance, suppose you have three tack strips that measure four feet each and you\u2019re trying to lay them along a 10-foot wall. Starting from one end of the wall, install two tack strips, then cut the third in half. If you want to fasten your carpet even more securely, you can install a second strip of tack strips in front of the first."
