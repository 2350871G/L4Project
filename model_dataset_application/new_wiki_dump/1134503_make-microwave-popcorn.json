You can use vegetable, canola, coconut, or olive oil to cook with. Set your stove-top to medium-high heat\nCoconut oil has a slightly sweet flavor to it, while olive oil is more earthy and savory.

If using a lid, leave it slightly off of the top, or use aluminum foil to cover the top, poking several holes in the foil with a knife. Shake the pot every 30 seconds.
