          "description":"If you plan to keep your ivy growing indoors to add some greenery to your living space, opt for a variety with smaller leaves. Smaller leaves mean the plant will not grow as fast and won\u2019t take up as much space. To grow ivy around a structure or use it as ground cover outdoors, choose the English or Boston ivy plant. Small leaf ivy varieties include the Golden Curl, Parsley Crested, and Spanish Canary. Make sure you know what kind of ivy you\u2019re planting beforehand so you know what you\u2019re getting into. Look up the leaves online to identify an ivy plant. English and Boston ivy have larger leaves and spread very quickly."

          "description":"Look for a section of an ivy plant that is old enough for the stem to be woody and strong, but young enough that it\u2019s still flexible enough to bend. Take 3 or 4 cuttings to ensure at least 1 of them will develop roots and grow. You can also purchase cuttings with well-established roots from a garden center, home improvement store, or nursery for convenience.Variation: You can plant ivy from seed by using a packet of ivy seeds or by collecting the berries of a mature ivy plant and removing the seeds. Soak the seeds in a glass of room temperature water for 24 hours to help the seedling break out of the shell. Then, plant them about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) deep into a container of all-purpose potting soil. After about 6 weeks, you can transplant them outdoors."

Take a sharp knife and remove a section of the ivy by cutting just below the node with as clean of a cut as possible so the stem isn\u2019t too damaged and roots will grow. The tip, or end of an ivy plant, is generally the best place to take a cutting from, but make sure it\u2019s still flexible. You can also use a sharp pair of scissors or pruners to cut the ivy."

When you see roots forming, the ivy cuttings can be transplanted to an indoor pot or the soil outside to start growing. Avoid moving or disturbing the cuttings so they can produce their roots. The ivy cuttings can survive in the glass of water for several weeks so you can plant them whenever you\u2019re ready."
