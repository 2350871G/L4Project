          "description":"Small tables and chairs are good options since they likely won't be too heavy. Find an empty cardboard box, and cut it into pieces big enough to slide under the legs of your furniture. To keep furniture from sliding off the cardboard, bend the tips upward to create a barrier. You may have to connect the barrier with strong tape or glue to keep them bent. Try duct tape or crazy clue. Just make sure it doesn\u2019t stick to the furniture. To make cardboard more durable, attach multiple pieces together (2 or 3) before placing them under the legs. Use tape or glue. Alternatively, use entire cardboard boxes, such as empty tissue boxes, to slide furniture across carpet. Just slip the legs in the openings."

          "description":"Tear enough pieces of aluminum foil to slide under your furniture legs. You can mold the aluminum foil against the furniture legs, which will keep it in place. It doesn't matter which side of the foil you use against the carpet. To make the foil thick enough, you may have to evenly fold it 1 or 2 times before placing it underneath. This will ensure it doesn't shred as you are sliding your furniture."

Turn the frisbees upside down, and place the furniture legs on the bottom side. The legs will be secured by the frisbees\u2019 upward-facing curves. Don't use frisbees with holes in the middle."

Bending over isn\u2019t necessary, allowing for proper upright posture. This equipment includes straps and harnesses for 2 people, so make sure you have a partner. It\u2019s one-size-fits-all and adjustable to different heights. A shoulder dolly can lift up to 1000 pounds. It moves furniture seamlessly across carpet and other surfaces. Fit the webbing through the buckles, and attach it together. Place the webbing directly under the furniture, and carefully lift to move it to your desired location. Use your hands to stabilize the furniture so it doesn't fall over."

Some moving dollies have handles you can grip for tilting and stabilizing furniture as you roll it. Although carpet dollies are designed to transport long and heavy carpet rolls, you can use them to move furniture across your carpet. Choose the type that allows you to completely place furniture on a flat surface."
