The rest of the crumb mixture will be sprinkled over top. If you prefer all crumb on top, spread all the batter into the prepared pan, making sure the whole thing is covered. Then, put all of the crumb mixture on top of the batter. If you are using the 9\" pan, bake for 40 to 55 minutes. If you are using the 8\" pan, bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick or a sharp object comes out clean."
