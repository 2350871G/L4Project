Estimate each item's cost, add them to find the total cost, and compare that figure with your savings, lines of credit, or other means of paying for the project. Estimate costs for a few scenarios: total your must-have priorities, create a plan with your needs plus a few wants, and estimate how much your ideal basement would cost. For instance, drywall might be a must, a ceiling with recessed lighting could be a plus, and adding a bathroom might be ideal. Labor and material costs vary by location, but you can search online for calculators that offer rough estimates. If you want to finish your basement, try to include a 15 to 20 percent contingency in your budget. If you have limited savings, you can also see if you qualify for a home improvement loan."

          "headline":"Finish your basement if your budget allows.",
          "description":"Figure out what you can afford, then plan your project's scope accordingly. Depending on your basement's condition and your expectations, it could cost anywhere between $6,000 and $20,000 (USD) to finish it. If you're going all out, your budget should be about 10 to 15 percent of your home's value. Specific expenses depend on the project. Framing and installing drywall can cost between $1,500 and $3,000, depending on the area's size. Adding a ceiling will cost another $1,250 to $1,500. Expect to pay an electrician $50 to $100 per hour. A large project, like an entertainment room, can run between $2,000 and $4,000. If there's existing plumbing, a bathroom could cost $500 to $1000. However, building a full bath from scratch will cost at least $6,000. Settling for a half bath can help trim your budget. You'll also need permits and inspections, which can add anywhere from $100 to $3,000."

          "description":"For a smaller price tag, make quick, inexpensive fixes to an unfinished or partly finished basement. Cosmetic fixes include carpet tiles or area rugs, furniture and accessories, and easy lighting upgrades. A rug or carpet tiles can cost around $100 to $200 (or more, depending on quality and coverage area). Quick lighting fixes, like string and tube lights, should cost less than $100. New furniture and accessories could cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, but buying secondhand pieces will cut your costs."

          "description":"You might be able to create multiple rooms if your basement and budget are large enough. If you're working with limited space and funds, create a single room that suits your lifestyle. It should get enough use to justify the cost of decorating it. For instance, create a family room if you want a cozy hangout spot. If you work from home or need a more productive space, turn your basement into an office. You could set up a game room or bar if you love entertaining guests or want to decorate the space around a pool or ping pong table you already own."

If you're finishing it and want a polished look, build walls to conceal the hot water heater, furnace, and other machinery. If you're just upgrading a partly finished basement, incorporate your pipes and ducts into your look. Polish them or paint them a bright color to add interest. For a cleaner look, paint the pipes, rafters, and walls white or light gray."

          "description":"Consistent design elements will make the basement feel like a natural extension of your home's livable space. If you're on a budget, simple choices like paint colors can add continuity. If you're installing drywall downstairs, add baseboards and moldings to mimic upstairs. If your main level has crown molding, include it in the basement as well."

          "headline":"Hire a contractor, plumber, and electrician to finish your basement.",
          "description":"While you can handle cosmetic changes and easy upgrades on your own, you'll need professionals to handle a full renovation. A contractor can help you plan the layout, oversee the project, and ensure precautions are taken to avoid damaging your home's structure. Wiring and plumbing also need to be professionally installed. Ask family, friends, or a local building inspector for referrals. You can also find a licensed contractor here: https://www.nari.org/consumers/find-a-remodeler. Get bids from at least 3 contractors. Make sure each contractor is licensed in your state, look for reviews online, and ask if they can provide references from satisfied customers."

If you have leakage problems, inspect your gutters and extend your downspouts at least 10 feet (3.0 m) from your home. If your property is on a hill, consult a landscape architect about regrading the soil around your home's foundation. Other sources of moisture could include cracks in the foundation or exterior walls, plumbing problems, and faulty window wells or door frames. If you have persistent moisture or mold problems, consult a building inspector or licensed contractor."

Clear everything out of the space and clean the floors thoroughly first. Use a roller to apply the paint across wide areas and a brush to paint the edges. You could go with a muted gray or brown, or use a more energetic color, like blue or green. Purchase epoxy paint online or at a home improvement store. Read the directions carefully, and mix the paint as directed. Each coat will need time to cure, so check the instructions to see how long you'll need to leave the floor undisturbed."

You could also use carpet tiles, which are more permanent than rugs, but are still easy to install. If you're dealing with 1 large space, use a rug or carpet to define a portion of it as a distinct room. Place a sofa and chairs around a rug or carpeted area, add a coffee table in the middle, and mount a television on the wall or on a console. Use similar strategies to divide the area into rooms with other purposes."

For an easier, less expensive option, string picture wire across the basement, and hang thrifted curtains or sheets from it. Curtain track systems for dividing rooms are available online and at home improvement stores. A 12 foot (3.7 m) track typically costs around $100."

Light colors will help expand and brighten the space. Display books, knick-knacks, and decorative objects on the bookcases to make the space feel more homey."

          "description":"Whether you're dressing up an unfinished space or decorating a finished basement, ceiling height is probably an issue. Furnish your basement with a sofa, chairs, desk, and other pieces that are as low to the ground as possible. For instance, a sofa with a back around 33 inches (84 cm) high is a good low-profile choice. If purchasing new low-profile furnishings all at once isn't in your budget, keep your eye out for secondhand scores. Have patience, and gradually purchase inexpensive pieces at thrift stores, consignment shops, estate sales, and Craigslist. You can also see if any friends and relatives are looking to get rid of suitable furniture."
