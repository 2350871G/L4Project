          "description":"For images that are irregularly shaped, measuring with a ruler or tape measure can be difficult. In these cases, outline the perimeter with a piece of string, then measure the length of the string to find the perimeter. For rough scaling of simple 2-D objects, you can probably get by with only measuring the width and height of the object. It\u2019ll be helpful when you start drawing the scaled image if the perimeter is broken up into segments, like the top, bottom, and sides. You may be able to break up the perimeter into small, regular shapes, like squares and triangles. These segments can be added together to find the perimeter."

          "description":"Common ratios include 1:10, 1:100, 2:1, and 4:1. When the first number is smaller than the second, it represents scaling down (reducing). When the first is larger than the second, it represents scaling up (enlarging). When scaling down images that are especially large, expect the second number in the ratio to also be large. A 1:5000 ratio might be used to fit a building-sized object on a single sheet of paper. Enlarge small images by increasing the first number of your ratio in small increments. A 2:1 ratio will be double the size of the original, a 4:1 ratio will be quadruple, and so on."

          "description":"When scaling down, divide the original measurements by the second number in your ratio. When scaling up, multiply the original measurements the first number. Some ratios may be irregular, like 5:7. All this means is that for every 5 units of distance in the scaled drawing, you\u2019ll have 7 units of distance in the original. For example, if scaling down with a 1:2 ratio, a length of 4 inches (10 cm) would become 2 inches (5.1 cm) because 4 \u00f7 2 = 2. When scaling up with a 2:1 ratio, a length of 4 inches (10 cm) would become 8 inches (20 cm) because 4 x 2 = 8."

If your drawing doesn't have a suitable straight segment, one that is mostly straight might work just as well. If your image is highly irregular, try drawing the perimeter from the top down or bottom up."
