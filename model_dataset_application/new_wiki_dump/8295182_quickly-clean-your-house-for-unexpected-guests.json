          "description":"Before you start any actual cleaning, remove all trash from rooms your guests will spend time in. Throw away any old magazines, trash from food, and work- or school-related papers. These messy items are the first things your guests will notice, so they should be the first that you clean up. If you have time before guests arrive, do a second walkthrough with a laundry hamper. This time, pick up out-of-place items from every room, place them in the hamper. Once you\u2019ve walked through the house and placed items in the hamper, return the items to the room they belong in. For example, grab the cereal bowls from the living-room couch, and place them in the dishwasher.

          "description":"Whether you\u2019re dusting a bookcase or cleaning kitchen counters, always start cleaning on the upper surfaces, and work your way down to the lower surfaces and the floor. This will push dust from higher surfaces down onto lower surfaces, ensuring that you fully clean the appliance or room. If you clean from the bottom up, you risk leaving dirt or other residue on the higher-level surfaces. This step applies on both large- and small-scale cleaning. If you clean the top floor of your house first, you\u2019ll bring dirt from upstairs rooms down the bottom floor. Then, when you finish dusting and vacuuming the bottom floor, you\u2019ll have removed all of the dust and dirt. ."

Large, highly visible surfaces\u2014especially windows, tabletops, and counters\u2014show fingerprints easily and should be cleaned. Clean large visible surfaces using Windex or another all-purpose cleaner. You may already have these products around the house, but if not, they can be purchased at a local convenience store or grocery store. When cleaning large surfaces, like windows, it can help to mentally break the surface down into a grid. This will help you clean the window fully: start in the top-left, then top-right; move to cleaning the middle-left, and so on."

Vacuum large open areas first; your guests are unlikely to notice specks of dirt in a dark living-room corner. Before you begin vacuuming, check your vacuum\u2019s bag or dust-receptacle.
