In Animal Crossing New Horizons, the Stingfish can be found between 4PM to 9AM in December through March in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, it's found between 4PM to 9AM in June through September. If you really want a Stringfish, and it\u2019s not the right time in the real world, you could always do Time Travel (i.e., manually change the date of your Animal Crossing town) in order to make it the right time."

      "description":"The shadow that the Stringfish makes in the water is bigger than the shadow that other fish make. If you want to save yourself the time of simply catching every fish in the river, just look for the big shadow. To help you save time, run along the side of the river if you only see small shadows. Running will scare away the small fish, and waiting a short bit of time will result in new, different fish populating the river. Rinse and repeat until you see that large shadow that you\u2019re looking for. In Animal Crossing New Horizons, craft fish bait from manilla clams at the crafting table. Use it at the clifftop river to increase your chances of finding a stingfish."
