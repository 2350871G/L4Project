In some areas, license only allow about 2 gallons worth of catch for non-commercial use. Be sure to know your limits so you do not get ticketed."

The \u201cpurge valve\u201d allows you to dive frequently for collecting without letting water go down into your snorkel. This makes for easier breathing and less frequent stops. The netted diving bag should have a drawstring closure because caught scallops may try to swim and escape. US laws often require a \u201cdiver down\u201d flag aboard your boat to let people know there are divers in the water. Make sure you have one as well, if needed."

You may be able to spot overturned scallops from the boat, but you may need to drop in occasionally to see if you are in a good location. The easiest sign of scallops are a few turned upside down with the brighter side facing up. This usually means a good number of additional scallops in the area turned with the darker, more camouflaged-side up. Seek out a clear, sandy floor with short grasses. Not only will it be easier to pick from, but you will be able to see collections of scallops well in these conditions."

Since scallops don\u2019t bite, the only thing you have to worry about is making sure to keep them in your diving bag. Come up often to measure your catch on board. Depending on where you are scalloping, patrols may come by to monitor that you are within your permitted limit. When you bring the scallops up to the boat, have ice ready to put the scallops on immediately. This will help to keep them fresh before you go on to clean and process them."

Whether you are dredging the floor or are trawling your net just above the floor, the scallops will either be laying motionless or swimming very slowly away. Trawling faster than this can increase the number of \u201cby-catches\u201d of other species. This will just increase the workload to filter later on. Dredging on the seafloor is also advised against as it often does more harm to the surviving sea life and vegetation. Catches can be just as successful pulling slightly above the seafloor as pulling the floor itself. As you pull in scallops, it can be wise to do filtering, a first wash and measuring immediately on the boat so that you do not end up out of permitted catch limits."

Additionally, if you need to return catch that was too small, they can survive by getting them back into the water as soon as possible. Filtering as you catch will also make sure you can accurately measure as you work.

By putting the scallops on ice immediately, or, if able, flash-freezing them will kill the scallops and make them easier to crack open and clean. If you plan to haul to the scallops around for multiple days, as is common for commercial fishing vessels, it is better advised to hold them alive in cool saltwater, preserving their freshness."
