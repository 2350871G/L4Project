Lily Rose Shadowlyn is sweet, and loves to cuddle, but she can give lethal \"vampire kisses.\" Count Vlad Von Gloom is a descendant from Dracula and is very royal. Choose wisely. There are six in all and they all have their ups and downs. You can read about all of them in the Hall Of Horrors on the Vamplets website."

When Destiny gave them milk first, they threw a tantrum. Which is why they never have milk, you can get a blood bottle on the vamplets website."

Include stuffed animals (Midnight Mori will need a stuffed unicorn to put her to bed), bedtime stories (Dracula, Alice in Wonderland, and Coraline are good stories to name a few), toys (spikey ball, tug -o-war chain, doll haunted house), and decorations (mini bouquet of roses, little black rug, etc.)"

This can be done by placing them in an enclosed pitch black space for a certain amount of time, or giving them a stern talking to. But never physically hurt them!"
