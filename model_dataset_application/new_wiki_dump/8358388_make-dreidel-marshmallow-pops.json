After all the chocolate is in the bag, snip off one of the bottom corners, making a small cut. Cut off only a tiny corner, so that the bag can function as a kind of frosting piper. If you have a frosting piper, you can also simply pour the chocolate in the piper bag."

Pipe out each of the four Hebrew letters that are found on a dreidel: Nun, Gimel, Hey, and Shin. Refer to other dreidels you may have at home or pictures of dreidels online if you are unsure of what these letters look like. Make 12 sets of the four Hebrew letters. You will eventually stick one set on each of the 12 marshmallow dreidel pops you are making. Nun and Gimel are similar-looking letters, so make sure to add the heel of the Gimel, which differentiates it from the more rounded Nun."

If your mixture is extremely thick and hard to stir, add a tablespoon (14.7 ml) of vegetable shortening and stir until the shortening is integrated and the candy melt mixture is smooth. Ideally, if you dip a spoon in the candy melt mixture, you want the mixture to stick to the spoon and slowly drip off.
