Christina Millikin\t\t\tFounder & CEO, Glow Events\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: You should send out your invitations early enough to get your RSVPs back about a month before your event. However, if you're not sure of all of the details of the event that early, you can include a website in the invitation that your guests can visit. That way, you can post updates as you get closer to the event date."

At your party, divide guests into two teams, give each group a stack of magazines, and start a timer for 15 minutes. Each team will frantically flip through the magazines in the hope of becoming the first team to find all the must-find items. Locating enough fashion magazines can be tricky. Ask your parents to buy the magazines, borrow magazines from friends and family, or ask doctors offices and salons for old magazines.
