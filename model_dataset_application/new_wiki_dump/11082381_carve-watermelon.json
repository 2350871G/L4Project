          "description":"If you\u2019re going to carve watermelon, you don\u2019t want it rolling around while you\u2019re trying to make intricate and delicate cuts. With your watermelon on a cutting board, cut a flat platform into the bottom of the rind with a long chef\u2019s knife. Hold the watermelon with your nondominant hand, and cut once through section between \u20444\u20131 inch (0.64\u20132.54 cm) deep at the thickest part of the rind to create a flat base for your watermelon to rest. Whether you make your cut on the short or long side of the watermelon depends on what you\u2019re carving. Remember, the section where you make this cut will become the bottom of the watermelon. Place a towel between your cutting board and the countertop to keep your cutting board from sliding around."

          "description":"If you\u2019re carving watermelon for decorative purposes, you may not need the edible pieces inside. Remove the insides if you can by cutting your watermelon in half and using a large spoon to scoop them out. There\u2019s no reason to waste perfectly good food if you don\u2019t have to. If your project calls for chunks of watermelon to serve as part of the design, you can cut cubes out of the watermelon interior by using a chef\u2019s knife to cut a perpendicular grid in the watermelon and scooping it out with a spoon or melon baller. Use your leftover watermelon to make a juice or simple snack. You can also freeze it and use it later."

This will ensure that you aren\u2019t damaging your watermelon rind when making larger cuts and will make carving much easier. Avoid serrated blades or risk damaging your watermelon."

Start by inserting a toothpick into the smaller piece\u2019s rind. With one hand on the remaining section of the toothpick and one hand on the rind that it\u2019s connected to, guide it into the larger piece of watermelon to connect them.Tip: You can also use skewers if you have longer sections that you need to connect."

          "description":"Cut your watermelon lengthwise in half with a chef\u2019s knife. Then, make a smaller parallel cut roughly 4 inches (10 cm) across at the bottom of either half of your watermelon so that it rests flat on your cutting board. Use a smaller knife to carve a grid into the watermelon\u2019s interior and use a spoon to scoop the pieces out. Use the same spoon to scrape the red, edible residue off of the rind. Wash the rind out by gently rubbing it while the rind runs under cold water to remove the residue from your watermelon bowl. You can fill the bowl with cheeses, fruit, or dip to make a fun serving dish for snacks. Since you\u2019ll have two halves when you cut the watermelon, do this twice to make a matching pair of bowls."

Choose a short end to be the face and use a dry erase marker to draw out an open mouth with the center section of the mouth opening 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2 cm) from lip to lip and the corners meeting on opposite sides of the melon. Cut halfway through your melon across the lines that you\u2019ve drawn with a chef\u2019s knife. Scoop out the mouth section with a spoon and dice the edible section into 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) triangles or squares before putting them back inside the melon. Create openings for the eyes with a melon baller by scooping out two eye sockets on opposite sides above the mouth. Use toothpicks or broken skewers to make teeth by sticking them in the section of exposed rind where you made your first cut. Use the section of rind that you removed for the mouth to make the eyebrows. Carve 2 small pieces so that they\u2019re shaped like crescent moons. Carve parallel lines downward from the arch of each eyebrow to give the eye depth and affix them above the eye sockets with toothpicks. You can cut out small drop-shaped sections for nostrils above the center of the mouth. You can also cut out and add 2 pieces of excess rind to make them drop-shaped and attach them with toothpicks to create your nose."

Using the same line, draw triangular wings that extend outward so that you have jagged tailfeathers in the back of your outline. Carve your outline with a thin scalpel or utility knife. Remove excess layers by using a chef\u2019s knife to cut out bigger chunks and a spoon to scoop out and smooth the interior. Use your utility knife to cut details out.Tip: Fill your swan with other pieces of melon or fruit and use it as a fun fruit bowl at a party or social event.

Using the same line, draw triangular wings that extend outward so that you have jagged tailfeathers in the back of your outline. Carve your outline with a thin scalpel or utility knife.

The full outline of the swan will circle around your entire watermelon. Using a Stencil to Carve Messages Cut a flat section across the long side of the watermelon to make a stand. Carving words into a watermelon rind involves making a lot of careful cuts, so you don\u2019t want your watermelon rolling all over the place. Make a flat and even cut \u20442\u20131 inch (1.3\u20132.5 cm) across the long bottom of the rind and use it to rest your watermelon firmly on your cutting board. Print the words you want to carve and tape them to the melon. Type the words you want to carve in a word processing program and print them.
