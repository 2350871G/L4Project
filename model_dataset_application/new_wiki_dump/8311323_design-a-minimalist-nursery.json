          "description":"It is easy to clutter a baby's room with toys and tools that they do not need. For a minimalist design, you should decide ahead of time what types of furniture you need in the room. Only write down the bare necessities. A crib is the most important item in the room. You should look for a crib with a high safety rating that can potentially be used for future children as well. It should be sturdy but stylish, with sleek lines. A rocking chair glider will be the centerpiece of the room. It should be comfortable but sturdy. If you're planning on having more children, you should make sure it is a neutral color that can fit into the d\u00e9cor of any room. A changing table and dresser will be necessary. You can buy a changing table built into a dresser or a separate attachment that can be placed on top of a dresser. You will want enough storage for your baby's toys, clothing, diapers, and other necessities but not so much that it clutters the room. Consider storage bins, shelves, and hanging storage."

Decide what it is you like about the design. Does it have a pleasing color palette? Are there particular pieces of furniture that stand out to you? Design websites, such as House and Garden or Parents may have galleries of pictures. Pinterest is a popular place for people looking for nursery ideas."

If you do not want one overwhelming theme, you can also choose a few motifs to guide your design instead.

If you want more colors, add it with bold accent pieces. Gray, white, and black are the best base colors for a minimalist palette. When deciding on accent colors, you might want to choose two or three colors. These colors may also be the same type of color tone, such as pastels, earth tones, or jewel tones. Colors do not need to be based on the baby's gender. You can always design a nursery with neutral colors or non-gendered hues, such as orange or yellow."

Mark where the windows, doors, and closets are. Draw in each piece of furniture where you think it will look best. Erase and move around furniture until you have a design that appeals to you. You can use blue painter's tape to help you visualize the furniture inside of the room. Outline with the tape places where you want the furniture to go. Move the tape around as it suits you."

Tell them that you are planning on staying minimalist and only buying what you need. If you are willing to receive gifts, sign up for a registry at local baby stores, and register only for what you need. You can say, \"We are designing a minimalist nursery for the baby. This means that we're only buying what we need for the baby so that the nursery does not become cluttered.\" If you have a registry, you can say, \"If you want to get something for the baby, we have a registry at ABC Baby Store that can tell you what we need.\""

Crib liners are a good way of adding some color to the room. You will need many different options, as these can easily be ruined. Pick a few different designs for variety. If you have wood floors, you should invest in a rug. It should be plush, such as a wool or shag rug, but make sure that the pile is short rather than long. Wall art can provide interesting statement pieces without cluttering the room. You can put up wall stickers, framed prints, or a mural. A mobile can add an interesting touch while giving the baby something to look at. Choose ones with high contrast colors. You can buy one or make your own."
