Dig a shallow hole, large enough to fit the playground equipment in, but with a flat bottom. Make sure the hole is big enough to allow side room for the children to play in and to ensure they won't bump their heads going down the slide. Cover the hole with a layer of plastic sheeting, then smooth a layer of concrete over it.  Fill the concrete hole with small pieces of clean tire rubber to make the playground area soft enough for little feet.  Place the equipment into the hole and place it far enough from the sides to make sure there will be no trouble.  Place waterproof cushions under all slides and stairs for extra safety.  Fill hole with water, and route hoses to flow water over slides and steps. The water should be no deeper than six inches, but if the child is very small it should be shallower.
