      "description":"These nests are usually in higher places with plenty of foliage, rocks, and other natural objects used to conceal you. A good sniper position can see vast distances of the map. All this allows a sniper to kill without being killed. And as said before, keep moving. A well-seasoned sniper will scope out multiple sniping posts before taking his first shot."

If a target is trying to make a speedy getaway in a vehicle, you need to adjust your aiming speed according to that of the vehicle. When you see an opportunity to fire, take it."
