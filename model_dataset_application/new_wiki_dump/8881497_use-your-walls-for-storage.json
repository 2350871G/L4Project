          "description":"Buy a basic towel bar and metal S-hooks at a hardware or big-box store. Follow the towel bar instructions to attach it to a kitchen wall with available space. Hang the S-hooks from the bar. Hang pots and pans from the S-hooks. The benefit here is that you\u2019ll free up cabinet space and the cookware is easier to reach. It\u2019s best to screw the towel bar into wall studs whenever possible. Since cookware weighs more than a towel, you\u2019ll need the extra support."

          "description":"Buy a sturdy magnetic knife strip from a department store or hardware store. Hang it on the wall over the counter where you are most likely to use the knives. The benefit of this is that by moving the knives to the wall, you free up the counter space that the knife block was using. It also saves a bit of time grabbing a knife from the wall rather than from the knife block."

          "description":"Go to the hardware store and buy a rectangular piece of pegboard, as well as some hooks that are designed for pegboard use. Pegboards come in many sizes, so choose what suits your wall space best. Hang cooking utensils or other kitchen items for quick access. You\u2019ll also need a minimum of four screws to secure the board to the wall at the corners."

Slide the mason jars into the ring clamps and tighten the clamps. Hang the board on the wall over your counter. Use the jars to store utensils, spices, change, batteries, toothpicks or almost anything that fits in the jars. Be sure to screw the board into wall studs so it\u2019s secure."

Secure the boxes to the wall by screwing them into studs or using curved wall hooks. This is a versatile option because it works with any type of basket, box, or crate. The material of the basket will determine what hanging method works best. For wooden crates, screwing them into studs is a good option. Wire baskets can be hung from hooks.

Buy three or four wooden spice racks and attach them in a vertical row to your child\u2019s wall. Try to screw the racks into studs whenever possible. If you want to get more creative, paint each rack a different color. Then use a stencil to paint words.

Feed a piece of rope through each hole, knotting it under the board. Screw hook screws into wall studs and tie the rope around the hooks. The shelf can be as long you want, but may require more rope and hooks for a longer shelf. Always use caution when using power tools."

Use these to hang shoes that clutter the floor of the doorway. This is great as an organizational tool because it gets the shoes up off of the floor. The basic setup can be moved to any room of the house as a way for extra storage. Nail the hooks higher up on the wall for things other than shoes."

The benefit of cork boards is that it\u2019s easy to take things down and pin new things up. They work great for collecting the various scraps of paper that always accumulate around the house."
