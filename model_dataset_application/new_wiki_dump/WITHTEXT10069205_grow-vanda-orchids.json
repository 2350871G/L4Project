          "description":"Check each of your plants or seedlings thoroughly before purchasing them. Look for an orchid with flowers that are partially open and some flowers that have yet to open. If all of the flowers have opened already, then it will be difficult to evaluate the health of the plant. Inspect the petals for fungal spots and pests, which would indicate that the plant is not healthy. The grower\u2019s shop is also a good indication of a plant\u2019s health. Consider the cleanliness of the shop, the attentiveness of the shop employees, and whether or not the grower is knowledgeable enough to answer your questions."

Transferring an orchid at any other time of the year may cause undue stress to the plant and this may kill it. Orchids become dormant in the winter and will begin to grow again in the spring. Try to time your transfer for early in the spring before the orchid starts growing and flowering."

Make sure to wait until after the orchid has bloomed to repot it though. Don\u2019t wait too long to repot your orchids! The roots should not grow more than 0.5 in (1.3 cm) before you repot it."

Instead, choose a special orchid posting mix, bark chips, tree fern, or stones as the growing medium. This will help to ensure that your orchid will have a solid foundation for its roots, but will not get soggy from frequent watering. Check your local nursery or garden center for a special potting mix for orchids. If you are not sure what to buy, ask an employee for a recommendation."

Then, cover the roots of the orchid with additional soil, but do not pack it tightly. You may also keep your vanda orchids in hanging baskets outdoors during the summer months."

Provide your orchids with humidity by placing some gravel on a tray and pouring water over the gravel. Place your orchids on the gravel and replenish the water as needed. The heat from the orchid\u2019s environment will cause the water to disperse into the air. You may also place a humidifier in the area where you keep the orchids to ensure adequate humidity. You can also mist the orchids to provide extra humidity when the weather is hot. Make sure that the water line is below the bottom of the orchid\u2019s pot.

You may want to bring your orchids in at night during the cooler months or when temperatures are expected to drop below 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C).
