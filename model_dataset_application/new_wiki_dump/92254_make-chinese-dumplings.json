Wonton wrappers (also called skins) are delicate and paper-thin, usually about a thirty-second of an inch thick. They typically come in three-inch squares and are made from flour, eggs, and salt. These wrappers, which are Chinese in origin, are suitable for boiling, steaming, deep-frying, and pan-frying."

If you'd like to be extra thorough, then you can add a dash of salt to the cabbage and let it sit in a bowl for 10 minutes; this will allow the salt to soak up the excess moisture in the dumplings. Mix the cabbage and minced meat together by hand. Ground meat is meat finely chopped by a meat grinder. The process of mincing is usually done manually.

To make sure that they are thoroughly cooked, one method used in China is the \"3 boil\" method. To do this, add the dumplings to boiling water, and return the water to a boil.

Serve. Serve these tasty dumplings while they're warm. You can enjoy them with a dipping sauce of your choice. Frying the Dumplings Heat cooking oil in a medium-sized pan over medium heat. You should cook about 8 dumplings at a time if the size of the pan allows it. Once the oil heats up, you should place the first 8 dumplings on the pan while trying to move them apart enough so that they don't stick together. Fry the dumplings for 2-3 minutes until their bottoms are light brown.  Add 50 milliliters of water to the pan and heat it over high heat.

Once you've finished frying these dumplings, remove them from the pan and place them on a plate with a paper towel on it to absorb the excess oil. You can also remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and shake the extra oil back into the pan. Cook the remaining dumplings. Then, cook the remaining 12 or so dumplings in two batches. Do exactly what you did with the previous batch of dumplings, adding more oil when necessary. Serve. Serve the dumplings while they're warm with your favorite dipping sauce.",
