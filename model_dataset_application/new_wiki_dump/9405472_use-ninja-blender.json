          "description":"Fruits and vegetables are ideal to use in the blender. You can create any combination of ingredients that are tasty to you. If you are using a fruit such as a banana or orange, make sure to peel it before putting it in the blender. Most fruits and vegetables don\u2019t necessarily have to be chopped up unless they are too large to fit in the blender, but chopping them up first helps to measure out portions. Make sure the lid is locked down before you choose a setting. You should not, however, use any hot ingredients in the blender. You can put cubes of ice or frozen fruit in the blender, but they may dull the blades. Let fruit thaw out for a few minutes before adding it to the blender."

Hold down the button to activate the blender. Hold it down until you\u2019re satisfied with the consistency of your ingredients. The Pulse setting means that the blender will work at its fastest speed, but it will stop blending when you release the button for the Pulse setting."
