  "text":" Preparing the Pies Place the mini graham cracker crusts on a cookie sheet.  Stir the coconut extract into the vanilla pudding. Stir thoroughly to combine. Spoon about a 1/2 cup of vanilla pudding into each graham cracker crust.  Refrigerate the crusts with the pudding in them until ready to use.  Preparing the Coconut Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF/180\u00baC.  Place the flaked coconut in a resealable plastic bag with some yellow food coloring. Shake the bag until the coconut is tinted yellow. Spread the tinted coconut on a cookie sheet in an even layer.  Toast the coconut, stirring every few minutes, until it is golden brown. (This should take about 7 to 10 minutes.) Once toasted, move the pan to a wire rack and let the coconut cool completely.  Preparing the Licorice Cut the orange licorice into twelve \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) triangles with scissors. This will form the beak. Cut the red licorice crosswise into 36 thin slices with scissors. This will form the comb and wattle. Forming the Hen House Pies Take the pies out of the fridge. Sprinkle the tops of the pies with the toasted coconut. Divide the whipped topping among four resealable plastic bags. Press out the excess air and seal the bags. Working with one bag at a time, keeping the other bags refrigerated, snip a \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) corner from the bag. Then add the hen features to the pies as follows:\nFor the hen's body, pipe a large dollop of whipped cream in the center of the pie, allowing the topping to form a peak at one end for the tail.

Serving the Pies Garnish a serving platter with bits of toasted coconut for hay. Add some white jellybeans for eggs. Arrange the 12 hen house pies on the platter. Serve cold.",
