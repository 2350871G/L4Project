Don\u2019t worry if a few beans float on the top. As soon as these beans soak up enough water, they will sink to the bottom. If want to cook more than one cup of beans, use more water. For every cup of beans, you should boil three cups of water. One cup of dried mung beans will yield three cups of cooked beans, or approximately three servings."

To check if the beans are ready, remove a small spoonful and allow it to cool before tasting it. A simmering pot will release a few small streams of bubbles. If the surface of the liquid is bubbling too much, reduce the heat. Resist the urge to add salt until the beans are done cooking. If you add salt while the beans are still simmering, they may become tough."
