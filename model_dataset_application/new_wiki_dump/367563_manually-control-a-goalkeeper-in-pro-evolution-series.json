Then quickly flick the ball down then up to chip the ball up, but don't recover the ball, dumping the ball to the opposition will give you more shots. Press R2 to call for the back-pass. Then when you get the ball, press R2 again to square up to the goal, then quickly flick the ball down then up to chip the ball up, but don't recover the ball, dumping the ball to the opposition will also give you more shots. You can also drop the ball and pass it behind the line for a corner. Get out of goal and towards the ball to try to catch it, or parry it. If you keeper is too short or can't jump, then don't do it too often."
