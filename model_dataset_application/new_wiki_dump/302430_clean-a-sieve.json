  "text":" Washing Up Prepare the washing water. As with any washing up, begin with a bowl of foamy hot water. Procure a brush of some sort, in particular one that is designed with washing up in mind.  Proceed to 'stab' at the sieve's holes with the bristles of the brush in a 'stippling' motion, dislodging any material stuck in the mesh.  Rinse. Once most of the material is dislodged, rinse the foam from the sieve with cold water, this will clear any remaining material and make draining and drying simpler. Boiling Clean the sieve roughly by using what ever cleaning tools you regularly use.  Remove the larger bits and pieces that will come off with a bit of effort.  Take a boiler or a pan.
