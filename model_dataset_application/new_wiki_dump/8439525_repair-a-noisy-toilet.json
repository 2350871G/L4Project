Thus, if the lid of your toilet is not completely in place, you may hear more noises than normal. Wiggle the lid around a bit to make sure it is seated properly. Before troubleshooting for a more severe problem, making sure that the lid is in place can save you a lot of time and headache."

In order to figure out what the problem is, you will need to familiarize yourself with the basic internal parts of a toilet. Inside the tank of your toilet there is a:\nFlapper: The flapper is connected to the toilet handle so that when you flush the toilet, the flapper is lifted. This releases the water in the tank. Float: The float can come in a variety of forms, usually a float ball or a float cup. It responds to the water level in the tank. When the water has filled back up in the tank, the float lifts high enough to switch off the water coming through the fill valve. Fill valve: Also sometimes called a flush valve, this valve is responsible for allowing water into the tank. It is turned on and off by the position of the float. Lever: The lever is the handle that you push down to flush the toilet. Inside the tank, it's connected to the flapper. If it's not connected correctly, then the toilet may run for long periods of time or fail to properly flush."

By having the existing fill valve with you, you can be sure to get a replacement that will fit your toilet. Ask an employee at the store to help you if you are unsure how to find the right part.
