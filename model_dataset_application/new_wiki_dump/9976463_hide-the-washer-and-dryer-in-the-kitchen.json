Use a tension or closet rod to hang the curtains from. Select a curtain that is long enough to cover almost the entire length from the ceiling to the floor, and coordinates with your kitchen so it doesn\u2019t look out of place."

Use a single panel divider if you have the space to keep it in one spot, and still have enough room to move around when the appliance doors are open. Use a multi-paneled, folding divider to place directly in front of your appliances. Simply fold it up and set it to the side when you need to do laundry."
