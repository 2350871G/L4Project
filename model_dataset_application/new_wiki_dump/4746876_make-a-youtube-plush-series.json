Make sure they are high-quality plushies - you don't want one with no head and stuffing coming out of it! Make sure all of the plushies are the sizes that are the most natural. If your dragon is smaller than your frog, then you might need to get a smaller frog plush or a bigger dragon plush."

Write down your ideas, sketch out the major storylines, and plan out the plot for each episode. Make sure the plot is original! There are tons of \"Peach is kidnapped by Bowser\" and \"Sonic has to defeat Eggman\" videos, as well as the Super Mario Logan Jeffy ones. Why not a series about something different?"

Each episode can attack one small part of the main plot, or each episode can be about something completely different. They can all use the same cast of characters, or each episode can focus on a different character."

If you don't like the way a series is going, make a series finale. If you don't want anything to do with a series anymore, than just announce the cancellation of the series."
