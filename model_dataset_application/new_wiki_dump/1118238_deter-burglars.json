          "description":"A burglar will want as much time alone and undisturbed in your house as possible. This will allow him to take what he wants without being caught. You can prevent your home from being a targeted by burglars by getting into a burglar mindset, which will help you shore up weak points in your home protection. Think like a burglar by asking yourself:\n\"How would I break in to my home if I had to? Would this be obvious to someone else? How can I make it less obvious/easy to break in to?\" \"Is my home easy to view by other people? Would other people see a person breaking into my home from the road? How can I make my home more visible?\" \"Does my home look unoccupied? How can I make my home look more occupied both when I'm away and at home?\""

Use dowels or rods as security bars. Lay these along the inside track of sliding doors and horizontally sliding windows to prevent being forced open. Install reinforced locks on exterior doors.

But even if a professional grade system is out of your price range, you can still purchase fake security cameras from your local hardware or home security store to achieve a similar effect. When setting up imitation cameras, be sure you do so convincingly. Connect the camera to an outlet even if it doesn't need power, and arrange other wires to appear connected to the inside of your home.

Security bars that you can attach to the outside of your windows can be bought at most hardware stores, and are a sturdy, high visibility deterrent. Second storey windows and doors are responsible for approximately 2% of burglaries, and usually only need to be secured with regular measures."
