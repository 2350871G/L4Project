For example:\nLet the group choose standard game or frantic, and take the time to explain the difference. (Standard game is one second down-time, frantic is one second down-time, so is a faster-paced game). Go the extra mile in answering the tech-obsessed kid\u2019s questions about how the pack works. Allow yourself to be used as a human shield by a bunch of teenagers. Let the birthday girl pick the teams. Ask whether a group want to play alone or with another group and accommodate that. Allow a group to take pictures of themselves with their packs on. Offer to take the picture."
