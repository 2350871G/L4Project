For this project, you\u2019ll need paint and primer (if you\u2019re not using a pre-primed, metal-clad door). Some products nowadays contain both paint and primer in one.

As you tap, the hinge pin will come out of the hinge. Pull the hinge pin out from the hinge. Repeat with the other hinge. Loosen both the hinges and remove the door. Have somebody else holding the door as you remove it from the hinges. When you have the door off, lay it horizontally on a bench or across two sawhorses. It\u2019s also OK to paint or stain the door while it\u2019s still hanging. In that case, you\u2019ll need to mask off the hardware or cover it with a painter\u2019s rag."

It will make painting much easier and faster if you don\u2019t have to paint around these things. You'll most likely need a Phillips or flathead screwdriver to remove the hardware."

When you find one, inject some filler into the hole to fill it. Smooth down the filler and press it into the hole or crack with a putty knife or scraper. When you\u2019ve filled all the holes, set the door aside to let the filler dry. Read the manufacturer\u2019s directions for exact times."

Soak a rag in mineral spirits or another solvent and rub the surface of the door. This step is not necessary if you're painting a wooden door."

This will also help remove any dirt and residue from the surface. Go over the entire surface of the door with 220-grit sandpaper, making sure to get all corners, nooks, and crannies. If you're painting a metal door, sand before cleaning it."

Take a slightly damp cloth and wipe down the entire surface of the door to get rid of any dust that the vacuum missed. Set the door aside and allow it to air dry for about an hour. If you cleaned a metal door with solvent, wash it with water mixed with a few drops of dish soap. Rinse the door and allow it to dry before proceeding."

Make sure the tape or paper covers every surface that you don\u2019t want painted. If you left the door on its hinges, tape adjacent walls, the frame, and the hinges. You can use a drop cloth, too, if you have one handy."

Your best bet for paint is either a water-based acrylic or latex paint, or an alkyd-based oil paint. Water-based paints tend to dry faster than oil paints, but oil paints will provide better protection for the surface underneath. If you currently have a water-based paint on your door, you'll have to paint over it with the same type of paint. The same goes for oil-based paints \u2013 you\u2019ll need to cover it with another oil-based paint. Make sure the paint you choose is specifically formulated for exterior surfaces."

You can use an oil-based primer with oil- and water-based paints. The best is to apply an oil-based primer followed by a latex paint. For primer color, choose a neutral color or a lighter version of the color you're painting the door."

However, make sure it\u2019s not raining either, and that it\u2019s not too humid or too windy. If it\u2019s too cold when you paint, the paint won\u2019t dry.
