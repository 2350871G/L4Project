      "headline":"Learn the zones of attack.",
      "description":"There are six zones of attack used to describe the moves in lightsaber combat. These are:\nZone 1 - the head\nZones 2 and 3 - the right and left arms and sides, respectively. Also refers to the right and left sides of the front torso. Zone 4 - the torso, specifically the back. Zones 5 and 6 - the right and left legs, respectively."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Learn the basic parry for each zone.",
      "description":"Zone 1 - a horizontal parry, in front of or above the head. Zones 2 and 3 - a vertical parry, with the lightsaber handle held near the chest or waist, and the blade pointing upwards. Less commonly, a drop parry (blade points downwards) with the handle held near the head. Zone 4 - a drop parry with the handle held behind the head. Zones 5 and 6 - a drop parry with the handle held near the waist."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Know that the basic attack for each zone is at right angles to the basic parry.",
      "description":"So a zone 1 attack is a (usually downwards) vertical stroke and other attacks are horizontal sweeps. Note that decapitation is classed as a zone 2/3 attack."

      "headline":"Always move forwards.",
      "description":"Don't retreat. Keep pressing forwards and cutting off your opponent."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Try to link your attacks together fluidly.",
      "description":"Shii-Cho has great potential for improvisation, as it is very simple. This makes it random and unpredictable, making it harder for your enemies to predict your actions. Mainly, though, it consists of broad sweeps linked together."

    {
      "headline":"Learn the disarming strike and the Sarlacc sweep.",
      "description":"In keeping with Jedi philosophy, the disarming strike attempts to disarm the opponent instead of killing them. It consists of a strong attack at your opponents weapon, in an attempt to rip it from their grasp - or chop it in half. The Sarlacc sweep is a rapid, sweeping movement designed to hit as many enemies as possible."

    {
      "headline":"Use Shii-Cho against multiple enemies.",
      "description":"Because of it's broad, sweeping movements, Shii-Cho is suitable for use against multiple opponents. However, a single opponent can easily find and exploit flaws in your attacks. In addition, the second lightsaber form, Makashi, was specifically designed for lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat. Do not use Shii-Cho against a Makashi user."
