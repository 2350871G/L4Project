      "description":"Toilets need to be cleaned every day and the constant liquid will likely impact the durability of the sticker, depending on where it is placed. For stickers placed directly under the seat (showing only when the seat is in the upright position), you'll need to use something that can cope with constant cleaning. A sticker placed on the cistern, wall or somewhere else above the bowl might fare better and not need washing as often. Placement is important for noticing though, so don't shift the sticker where it fails to catch the eye\u2013\u2013be prepared to do what will have the most impact! Here are several possible ways for making stickers:\nHomemade sticker hack: Make the sticker out of paper, then cover it with clear tape to adhere it to the seat. This won't last long but is very easily updated and replaced as needed. Old fashioned paper and tape: While this may not be truly deemed a sticker, you could use this method of signage around the toilet area. However, as it is clearly not waterproof, don't place this type of sticker sign near the toilet bowl or faucets. This temporary method can be easily revised and removed whenever you desire. Laminate the sticker: Either use a laminating machine or you can encase your homemade sticker between two sheets of contact paper. This can be another easily updated approach with temporary sticking power. Make an actual sticker, one that either clings or adheres long term: Printer programs and forms exist to enable you to make your own stickers. Or, you could have the sticker printed at a commercial printers after you've done all the design work. Just check that the adhesive can be easily removed once the message has worked its magic\u2013\u2013most sticker adhesives can be removed using goo-removing solutions or something like eucalyptus oil but you'll need to be sure the toilet seat surface can handle such solutions."

      "headline":"Design the sticker.",
      "description":"The design does need to be attention-grabbing. Eye-catching color is essential, so stick to bright colors, especially red, a color that tends to alert people to pay attention. Whether you use hand drawing, printed text or clipart is up to you, depending on what you're most comfortable with, just as long as the end result is visually attractive. Some design style ideas include:\nA visual-only sticker: Draw or use clip art to show the image of a person using the toilet, then putting down the seat, in the style of the airline safety sheets. Or, use the common symbol for a forbidden action, by showing the toilet seat upright inside a red circle with a slash through it. Visual stickers can be helpful for households with young children but since visual depictions attract our attention immediately, they're effective for alerting all householders and guests. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/ff\\/2142406-2-bullet-1.JPG\\/v4-460px-2142406-2-bullet-1.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/ff\\/2142406-2-bullet-1.JPG\\/v4-759px-2142406-2-bullet-1.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":308,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":508.4065934065934,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nWrite a simple message: A simple message stuck on the underside of the upright seat can be very effective when in bold colors. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b9\\/2142406-2-bullet-2.JPG\\/v4-460px-2142406-2-bullet-2.JPG\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b9\\/2142406-2-bullet-2.JPG\\/v4-759px-2142406-2-bullet-2.JPG\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":308,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":508.4065934065934,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nDirect the message to an actual culprit: Pinpointing the person who always leaves the seat up might work if he or she has a good sense of humor but do be careful with those who might be insulted by this direct approach.

Laminated sticker: Create the sticker on a piece of paper, cut it out and place it on top of one piece of contact paper. Use a glue stick to cover the bottom sheet completely and then gently place the next sheet on top. Smooth to remove any wrinkles.
