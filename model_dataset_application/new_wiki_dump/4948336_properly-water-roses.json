If your garden has clay-type soil then it will retain moisture better.

Newly planted roses may be at risk of drought during a dry, windy fall or winter. As a rough guide, in extremely hot weather you should assume rose plants will need watering daily. On a standard summer day with decent heat, you will need to water every two or three days, and in warm dry weather you will only need to water about once a week.
