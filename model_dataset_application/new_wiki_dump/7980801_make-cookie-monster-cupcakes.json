Ensure that you let your cupcakes cool completely on a wire rack before frosting or decorating them. If you frost cupcakes while they're still warm, the cupcakes will absorb the frosting or it may just slide right off."

Take a spoon and fill the piping bag with the blue frosting or buttercream. Cut the tip of the piping bag so you make a small hole in the end. You could also attach a pastry tip onto your piping bag. This would give your piped fur or frosting a unique design. Consider using a multi-opening tip to give the appearance of fur."

Try to make each cupcake look a little messy so the frosting looks like fur. You should cover the entire top of each cupcake with the blue frosting."
