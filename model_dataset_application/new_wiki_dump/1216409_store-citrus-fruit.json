Fruit that is under ripened will not have developed all of its sweetness, nutritional value and juice content. Properly ripened fruit will keep longer. Unlike other fruits, citrus fruits do not continue to ripen once they have been picked. So it is important that they be ripe right off of the tree. Ripened fruit will have very bright and vibrant colors. A fully ripened citrus fruit will have reached the fullness of its color. Dull looking fruit can indicate over ripeness and oranges with an abundance of greenish skin can mean that the fruit is under ripened. A bit of green on the skin of oranges and lemons is perfectly fine. These tend to keep the longest and will be perfect for storing."
