You can minimize the risk of bacterial contamination of food by choosing foods that travel well outdoors. Some examples include:\n\nDry food: Bread, rolls, crackers, etc. are usually safe choices. It's what you add to them that requires care, such as hot dogs, luncheon meats and salads. Food high in sugar: Sugar acts as a preservative and, in conjunction with dryness, can make foods safe for the tailgate party. For example, cake (no cream filling), cookies and candies. Fresh fruits and vegetables: Provided these are washed and handled properly, they are generally safe to enjoy at the tailgate party."
