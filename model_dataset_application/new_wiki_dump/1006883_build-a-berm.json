Most berms in home gardens are no taller than 24 inches (61 cm). An asymmetric appearance improves the aesthetics, with an off-center peak and a variety of slopes along the berm's length."

          "description":"Berms can act as miniature dams, altering the water flow in your garden. You may need to dig swales between the berms, build a culvert running through the berm, or regrade your garden. You may want to discuss this with a professional landscaper if you are building a tall berm (especially above 24 inches / 61 cm), or if you live in a rainy climate. A flat top reduces runoff and provides more water to plants growing on the side of the berm. While building your berm, do your best to avoid compacting the soil at the base with heavy equipment. If it's already compacted, loosen the soil by digging 8 inches (20 cm) deep to improve drainage."

Whether your berm is a slight curve or a full semicircle, keep the radius between 10 and 15 feet (3\u201345.m). The slope of the berm can be as gentle as a 7% slope, but steep downhill turns require a steeper angle. Building the turn around a tree, large rock, or other obstacle discourages bikers from short-cutting the turn. Make sure the obstacle doesn't block line of sight, and that it's not close enough to hit someone's head when they lean into the turn. For your first berm, avoid a sideslope (slope between the two sides of the turn) steeper than a 4:1 gradient (25%). Steeper slopes require a turning platform, which takes a lot more work."

There are two approaches if you decide to go this route:\nFlat, square stones weighing at least 50 lbs (23 kg) make the best retaining walls. Lock the stones together with smaller rocks and \"deadmen\" logs extending into the bank to prevent wobbling, then backfill each layer with small rocks and mineral soil. Wooden retaining walls take less labor, but rot over time. Use pressure treated wood rated for ground contact (\"heavy duty\" or \"extreme\" ground contact in wet climates). Lay deadmen logs into the bank, attached to the wall with notched log cabin construction."
