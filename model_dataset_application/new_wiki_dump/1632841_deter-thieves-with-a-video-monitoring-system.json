Accordingly, place your cameras in places where they will be noticed. Ideally, these cameras will also cover those areas that cannot be easily monitored by on-duty staff. For instance, hallways or other areas of a building that are relatively obscured are ideal locations for video cameras. If deterrence is your only goal, you can save money by using fake cameras.

In fact, in the U.S. alone, dozens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods are stolen by businesses\u2019 employees each year. Potential thieves on your staff may be deterred by video monitoring systems. However, they may also be aware of any gaps in the camera\u2019s coverage, so video monitoring systems alone cannot prevent employee theft. To prevent and diminish losses, install cameras covering your most valuable wares. For instance, place a camera in all storage areas, as well as those areas where any expensive equipment is kept. Only grant access to information about your video monitoring system to the minimum number of staff to ensure it can be used effectively."

Further, cameras on back entrances allow you to monitor anybody and anything that may come and go out your back door. Make sure the camera is visible from within the building if you\u2019re hoping to deter retail theft.

Some cameras have special features, such as panning, tilting, zooming, and night vision. For deterrence, you\u2019ll likely want to opt for overt cameras, which are designed to be plainly visible. Covert cameras \u2013 such as those hidden within a speaker or smoke detector \u2013 can help identify a recurring issue with theft by capturing a crime without the perpetrator knowing. Discreet cameras may be best for some environments. These are visible to someone who is looking, but will not negatively affect the feel of an environment. An example is a dome camera, covered by an unobtrusive glass dome."

They are often usable both outdoors and indoors. They also usually offer good enough resolution and \u201cnoise reduction\u201d \u2013 which prevents blurriness \u2013 to function adequately as security cameras. Expect to pay between $130 and $470 for each box camera you use."

Dome cameras also have a variety of capabilities, including infrared and low-light monitoring. These are also especially resistant to weather and criminal tampering. Dome cameras usually have a shorter depth of vision compared to box cameras. #*Expect to pay anywhere from $90 to $1,300 per camera. Dome cameras offer the best pan/zoom/tilt capability, including the potential to zoom in 60x and offer a 360-degree view. Costs can rise as high as $11,300 each for the highest-resolution models."

Frame rate, measured in frames per second (fps), is usually 6 to 10 fps for security cameras. However, if you hope to record and identify criminals, you need cameras that will be able to clearly identify perpetrators. Choose a camera with higher frame rate for improved image quality \u2013 30mps is considered \u201cfull motion.\u201d These are more expensive and produce video that requires large amounts of storage capacity."

The ratio of signal to noise (measured in db) varies from camera to camera, and is especially important when your video monitoring system will be in close proximity to other electrical components.

The quality of a lens will determine the camera\u2019s ability to shoot at different distances, or in a wide angle format. Lenses are often sold separately from cameras, especially on high-end models. This allows you to choose the lenses that are ideal for the environment you\u2019ll be monitoring. Opt for a fixed focal length lens for a camera with a stationary point of view. These lenses are the cheapest, at $46 to $400 each. Use variable focal length lenses if you want to be able to adjust a camera\u2019s focus. Lenses of this sort will allow you to manually adjust your field of view, and will cost between $40 and $660 depending on the range of the focal length. Motorized zoom lenses allow you to control your video image remotely. Namely, you\u2019ll be able to zoom anywhere from 2x to 60x. Costs for these lenses start around $700.
