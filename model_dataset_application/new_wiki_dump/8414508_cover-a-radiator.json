This will often cause the plastic to bend and change shape. Heat resistant padding can be used to create a safe barrier between sensitive material and direct contact with a radiator. A cloth, like a towel, specially designed heat resistant fabric (like potholders), and flame retardant fabric can be laid on top of radiators to protect covers from direct contact heat damage. Wood, for example, is often susceptible to heat damage.

A radiator cover with poor ventilation can greatly diminish the spread of heat throughout your home, which can be especially uncomfortable in northern or mountain climates. If you love a particular cover but it doesn't have good airflow, you may be able to improve this situation by using a small fan. Most covers will decrease the heat output of your radiator, some as much as 30%. Improved ventilation will decrease heat loss."
