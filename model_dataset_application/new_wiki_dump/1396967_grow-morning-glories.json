          "description":"Buy packaged seeds, or collect the seed pods from a friend's morning glory plant. As morning glory flowers die, they leave behind round seed pods at the base of the flower stem. The pods are ready to pick when they turn papery and brown, and contain dark brown or black seeds. Morning glories cross-pollinate, meaning that plants grown from seed will not necessarily look much like the parent once they grow."

          "headline":"Plant seeds after the last frost.",
          "description":"If planting outdoors, wait until the last frost has passed and the soil has begun to warm. If you'd like to start the morning glories indoors, plan on starting 4\u20136 weeks before the last frost. Depending on your local conditions you may be able to plant in late summer if you tend to have mild winters. If it gets cold in September, you probably shouldn't plant. If storing seeds over the winter, keep them in a dry, dark location."

        {
          "headline":"Scratch or soak the seeds (optional).",
          "description":"Some morning glory seeds are too hard to germinate quickly without help. Most growers either nick the seed with a nail file, or soak the seed overnight in room temperature water, in order to increase the odds of success. Often, you'll have so many seeds on hand that you can skip this step and accept that not all seeds will germinate. Some gardeners argue that soaking can cause rotting or infection, and that shallow planting in moist soil will produce similar results with less risk."

          "headline":"Select a permanent growing container or garden spot.",
          "description":"Morning glories react poorly to transplanting due to their delicate root systems, so it's best to pick one location and stick to it. If planting in an outdoor container, choose one at least 2 ft (0.6m) wide and 3 ft (0.45m) high for best results. If starting the plant indoors, use a 3 inch (7.6cm) peat pot that can be buried in your garden when you want to move the plant outdoors. Morning glories can be directly seeded outside successfully."

          "headline":"Prepare a well-draining soil.",
          "description":"Adult morning glories are very tolerant of poor soil conditions, but the seeds need a well-draining growing medium. To achieve this, mix 1 part perlite with 3 parts soil, or mix 1 part salt-free sand with 2 parts soil. Do not mix sand with clay-heavy soil. There's no need to grow these in extra-rich, fertile soil. Rich soil can even lead to fewer flowers in some morning glories, notably \"Heavenly Blue\" and other Ipomoea tricolor varieties."

If planting them directly in a garden plot, spacing depends on the variety's size and on personal preference. Consider planting the seeds 2 inch (5cm) apart, then culling to 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330cm) apart once the seedlings reach 3 inches (7.5cm) high. At this height, the seedlings are well-established and less vulnerable to pests."
