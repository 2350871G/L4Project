Create little \u201cwindows\u201d in the canopy by pruning back a few of the topmost branches. Be careful not create too many open areas in the canopy, though, as this could expose the tree\u2019s major branches to heavy sunlight.

Focus on smaller branches, pruning  several on each side, and only prune 1 major branch per year. Aim for a symmetrical conical shape, which provides the best amount of sun exposure. Re-shaping will likely make fruit yield drop drastically that year, but it should stimulate fruit growth in 2 years. Remember to be extremely careful with this kind of heavy pruning!

It\u2019s important to prune the sides of the tree symmetrically, making identical cuts to either side, to balance the tree\u2019s weight. For example, if you prune several branches on one side of the tree, it may stunt fruit growth on that side. When the fruit grows, the tree\u2019s weight will be unevenly balanced and make it more susceptible to strong wind and harsh weather."

This will direct the tree's nutrients to the healthy limbs and promote new growth. Although it may be tempting to cut away dead wood at any time of the year, remember that frost damage can sometimes make a branch look dead.

Avocado trees usually take 3 years to grow and produce fruit again after rejuvenation pruning.
