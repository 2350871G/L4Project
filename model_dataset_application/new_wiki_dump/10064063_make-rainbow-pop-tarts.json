  "text":" Making the Dough Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor. Blend well until fully combined. Add the butter and pulse the ingredients together. Blend for about 2-3 minutes, until the mixture turns into a crumbly texture. Sprinkle on cold water. You may need more or less depending on how much water it takes for the dough to stick. Pulse once more, until the dough begins to stick together and pushes down when touched. Divide the pastry dough into balls and add the food coloring. Separate and roll the dough into six medium-sized balls. Add a few drops of a different food coloring into each ball of dough. Roll the dough to even out the color. Flatten the balls of dough and stack them onto each other. Roll the balls into the shape of medium-sized flattened plates. Stack each color onto one another, but do not press them down. Slice the dough in half and roll them into two balls. Rolling the dough gently will combine the colors together which creates the rainbow-themed effect. Cover the dough and allow it to chill. Gently flatten the balls of dough with your hands and cover both with plastic wrap. Chill in the fridge for about an hour. Filling and Baking Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0 Fahrenheit (204\u00b0 Celsius).  Line a baking tray with parchment or waxed paper.  Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. Stretch out the dough until it is shaped into the size of a 10 by 8 inches (25 cm \u00d7 20 cm) rectangle. Cut out 4-6 rectangles from the dough. With kitchen scissors or a small knife, slice 4-6 rectangles out from the dough. Transfer the pieces to the baking tray. Add a dollop of jam on half of the pieces.  Fold the tarts over and pinch the edges. Close the pop tarts over by folding them into a half. Then, pinch the edges with a fork to seal the dough. Bake the pop tarts in the oven for about 20 minutes. Bake the tarts until the edges crisp and turn golden brown. Allow the pop tarts to cool. Remove the tarts from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack until warm enough to touch. Decorating and Serving Beat the whipping cream and vanilla extract in a bowl with a whisk.  Pour in the powdered sugar and beat once more. Whisk the ingredients until they are fully incorporated and resemble a glaze with no powdered sugar streaks. Spread the glaze over the tarts. Spoon about a tablespoon of the glaze and spread it over a pop tart. Repeat with the rest of the tarts. If you prefer less glaze on your pop tarts, you can use a fork to drizzle the glaze over the tarts instead. Sprinkle the rainbow sprinkles over each pop tart.  Serve. Allow the pop tarts to sit for about 5-7 minutes so the glaze can set. Afterwards, serve on a serving plate with a glass of cold milk, if desired. Enjoy!",
