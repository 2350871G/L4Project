You can print the template in the document above, and trace the shape onto the paper you want to use. If you choose to make your own disc, do your best to make the shape as round as possible. Improper measurements will have a big effect on your cone's result. It's a good idea to put extra effort into making the circle as round as possible. For your disk shape, you can also use a compass, or trace a round object, such as a lid or container."

          "description":"Use the template to cut out two sides from the circle to make your wedge. To draw your own wedge, make a mark in the center of the disc. Draw out two straight lines from the center point to make a wedge with your ruler. If the lines are closer together it will make a smaller wedge which will result in a cone with a broad bottom. Use a compass protractor to pinpoint the centre of your disc if you're unsure where to place your dot. If you're using a protractor tool to outline the disc to begin with, it can save you time to make the centre dot before you trace the disc around it. You can also draw your own triangle wedge using a ruler and pencil."

          "description":"To make a cone with a small bottom, cut out a larger triangle wedge. Use scissors or a precision knife to cut out your wedge as straight as possible. If you run into any cutting mishaps, you will probably need to start over again."

        {
          "headline":"Bring the cut sides of your disc together.",
          "description":"For your cone shape, bring one cut end of your disc over to the other in a cone shape. Hold it together and make sure the lower ridge of both sides overlap evenly. With this, your disc should have the desired cone shape you're looking for. Unfurl the paper and try again if the sides don't meet properly at first. Don't make firm creases in your paper. Your cone should be rounded."

          "headline":"Tape the inside of the cone closed.",
          "description":"Once you tape the two sides side by side so that the paper makes a cone. Tape the inside of the cone  by bridging the two sides so that they slightly overlap and bridging the overlap with tape. With that done, your cone should be ready to go. One straight piece of tape will give your cone the best stability. Multiple pieces of tape inside will make a mess. It is helpful to have one hand applying the tape while the other holds the shape of the cone."

          "description":"If the common disc method isn't to your liking, you can make a cone shape starting out with a paper triangle. In order for it to be rolled properly into a cone, there must be one long side, and two shorter sides of equal length. The bigger the triangle, the bigger your cone will be. Take care to make your measurements and cuts as accurate as possible. Slight errors can make your cone lopsided, or, worse still, too short to tape around. Similarly, you can make the same process work with a half-circle. A half-circle will result in a smoother top. If you don't want to make measurements yourself, triangle templates are available. Make sure you're using a template with one long side and two shorter sides of equal length."

With your other hand, bring the other corner and roll it overtop so that it wraps around the other corner. When this is complete, you should have a general shape of a cone in place. If you're having difficulty rolling the corners together, it may be that you didn't cut your triangle out wide enough. The far corners are the opposite ends of the wide triangle. Hold the first corner roll in place while you roll the other corner. One hand should be used for each corner."

If you think you rolled the two corner folds unevenly, feel free to try again. If there are excess lengths of paper jutting out from the cone shape, it may be that your original sheet wasn't an even shape. If this is the case, you can keep moving forward by cutting off any excess with a precision knife. So long as you have an even base for your cone, people won't be able to notice mishaps you had in the process of making it. It's a fairly quick process, so it pays to do it a few times until you get it right."

If the rolls have been done correctly, there should at least be a triangular end that should be folded inward. If for whatever reason you don't have enough paper to fold over, you can get over this issue by running a strip of tape across the base, from the outside to the inside of your cone. Try squeezing or loosening your grip on the cone if the folding slot isn't apparent enough."

With taping done, you should have a functional cone. The loose edge can be taped down as well."
