You may find it easier to do this in two pots. Cool the onions and then transfer equal quantities to freezer containers. I would transfer the equivalent of one to two onions to each container. Label each container and then freeze."

Whilst your meat is browning, simply defrost the onions and then add them along with the other ingredients.

You now have the basis for a whole range of dishes, from your best baked macaroni cheese recipe to baked fish in a sauce. You can add simple ingredients to make a pasta sauce or you could add the Bechamel sauce to a Lasagna or Moussaka. But the key thing is, that part of the work has already been done, thereby making it completely viable to have a nutritious meal on the table in a relatively quick time."

If you are going to make one batch of your favorite Beef Curry Recipe, make two - one for now, and one for the freezer. Apply the same rule to any stews, simple ground beef recipes and even chicken casseroles. Most of these dishes are good natured and will freeze well."

Put \"little bits\" together - egg whites, chopped frozen fresh herbs, leftover sauces and so on. A particularly helpful shelf in our freezer is the LUNCH BOX shelf. In this drawer there are all makings for healthy lunchboxes. There is leftover chicken, frozen in between layers of waxed paper. There are cooked burgers or ham. There are wraps, croissants, or muffins. This means that when we make lunchboxes at night it is easy for the whole family to get involved and home in on the correct drawer. It seems to simplify things and is certainly cheaper than take-out food."
