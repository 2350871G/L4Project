      "description":"Increase the speed from medium to high, and mix until the mixture just stays together, about 1/2 minute to a full minute, and is fluffy but not friably fluffy. If the mixture is over-tacky, pour more powdered sugar into the mixture. Continue to pour it until the mixture becomes drier. If the candies cannot be flattened because they're too smooth, or if you have a heated room for cooking food, allow them 20 minutes to become firm in your refrigerator."
