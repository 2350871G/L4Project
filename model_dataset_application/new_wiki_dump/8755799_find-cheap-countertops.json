With dimensions in hand, pick out the style you want along with a laminate covering. The countertop is then sent off to a fabricator to be covered. Fabricators can make laminate look like stone or granite, so this is a great choice if you want a high-end design."

Because butcher block is wood, you can cut it to size yourself or ask the store to do it for you. Butcher block is easy to maintain and looks great with many different decor styles. Do not use butcher block immediately around a sink. Use it on islands and around appliances. Make sure you oil the wood at least every 6 months."

Look for one at restaurant supply stores or online. Stainless steel provides a polished look and is a great choice if you like to cook a lot, since you can prep directly on the surface."
