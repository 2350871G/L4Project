Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Do not cover the pot with a lid. Reduce the heat once the water is boiling, and let the rice simmer for 10 minutes. At this point, you can place the lid on the pot. Turn the heat off once the rice has absorbed all of the water. You may notice some steam holes in the rice. Leave the pot, covered, on the stove for 10 more minutes. Rice gets stickier the longer you let it sit. If you make it a day or two ahead of time, your rice will be extra sticky. If you do plan on waiting that long, however, you might want to cover the rice and leave it in the fridge so that it doesn't dry out or spoil. Serve the rice. Transfer the rice to a serving plate.

You may be able to get regular rice to taste similar to sushi rice with the help of the right seasoning.

You can also use a spatula, but make sure that it is not made out of metal. Consider working in front of a fan, or having someone wave a paper fan over the bowl. This will help the rice cool down faster. Serve the rice while it is still warm. Japanese sticky rice is best while it is still warm, but not hot. Making Mango Sticky Rice Fill a large pot with 2 cups (450 milliliters) of water and bring it to a boil.  Add 1 \u00bd cups (300 grams) of short-grain rice or 1 cup (200 grams) of medium-grain rice. For best results, try to use a short-grain rice type. Short-grain rice tends to be starchier than medium or long-grain rice by nature, so it might give your better results. Popular medium-grain rice varieties include jasmine and basmati. Cover the pot with a and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Be sure to keep an eye on your pot so that it doesn't boil over. In another pot, combine 1 \u00bd cups (337.50 milliliters) of coconut milk, 1 cup (225 grams) of white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir everything together with a spoon to combine. You will be using this to season your rice. To save time, consider doing this while the rice is cooking. Bring the coconut milk mixture to a boil over medium heat. Be sure to stir the mixture from time to time. This will prevent it from getting scorched. Stir the coconut milk mixture into the rice once the rice is done cooking. When the rice has finished cooking, take the rice pot off the stove and remove the cover. Pour the coconut milk mixture into the rice, and stir it using a fork or spatula. Set the seasoned rice aside for one hour. Put the cover back on the rice pot, and place the pot some place where it won't be disturbed. This will give the rice enough time to soak up the flavors from the coconut milk mixture. Combine \u00bd cup (112.50 milliliters) of coconut milk, 1 tablespoon of sugar, \u00bc teaspoon of salt, and 1 tablespoon of tapioca starch in a saucepan. Stir everything together with a spoon. This will be your sauce. If you don't have any tapioca starch, you can also use cornstarch or arrowroot powder instead. Bring the sauce to a boil. Be sure to stir the sauce from time to time so that it doesn't curdle or scorch. Prepare the mango. Start by peeling the mango. If your mango is ripe enough, you should be able to nick the skin with your knife, then pull the skin off. Once you have the mango peeled, cut it in half and remove the seed. Cut the mango into thin slices. Repeat this step for the other two mangoes. Scoop the rice onto four plates. You can create more servings than just four, but the portions will be smaller. Arrange the mango slices. You can set them down right next to the rice, or on top of the rice. If you are placing the slices on top of the rice, to overlap them to create a fan-like shape. Drizzle the sauce over the mangoes and rice. If you want, you can also sprinkle some sesame seeds on top of the sauce. Keep in mind that, because you are not using sticky rice, the texture may not be quite the same as in the traditional dish.",
