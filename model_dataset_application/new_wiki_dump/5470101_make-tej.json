          "description":"To make a large batch of tej, you'll need a wide-mouthed, 1-gallon (3.8-L) glass jar with a lid. Wash the lid and jar in the sink with hot, soapy water. Rinse them with clean water, and then dry them with a towel. Place them on a baking sheet and transfer them to a preheated 225 F (107 C) oven for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes turn off the heat and leave the jar and lid there until you're ready to make your wine. It\u2019s important to sterilize your equipment before starting, otherwise harmful bacteria could grow in the wine."

To make a larger or smaller batch of tej, use a three-parts water to one-part honey ratio, and adjust the other ingredients accordingly. When you're done stirring, the liquid should be a golden amber color."

          "headline":"Stir in the yeast.",
          "description":"Sprinkle the yeast over the honey and water mixture. Use your large spoon to stir the yeast into the liquid. Any type of brewer\u2019s yeast will do, but if possible, look for the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is the yeast species that naturally grows in most tej batches. Tej is traditionally made by allowing wild yeast to accumulate in the mixture to ferment the wine. Because you can't control the kind of yeast this way, it\u2019s becoming more common to add yeast instead, as this ensures the batch won\u2019t become contaminated. To make tej without the addition of extra yeast, simply omit this step and add the gesho."

          "description":"Sprinkle the gesho on top of the mixture. Press it down with your spoon to saturate the gesho with the liquid. Stir the mixture to completely soak the gesho and incorporate it into the honey and water mixture. Gesho comes in two forms, which are entchet and kitel. Entchet is the bark from the buckthorn tree, and kitel are the dried leaves. Entchet is ideal because it\u2019s easier to remove during fermentation, but you can use either in your tej."
