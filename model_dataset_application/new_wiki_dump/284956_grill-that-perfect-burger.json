  "text":" Start with fresh ground chuck. Chuck is the most flavorful type of ground beef, and comes from a single cut of beef. Plain \"ground beef\" can include meat from all over the animal. Make sure the chuck has a fat content of at least 15 to 22 percent to ensure juiciness. If you prefer your burgers well done, ask your butcher for a higher fat content. This will allow you to cook them more without drying them out. Chill the beef well before forming patties. Wash your hands well, then form the patties. Season the meat with salt and pepper. Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper give the best flavor. Make each patty by forming about half a pound of ground chuck into a tight ball about the size of a baseball. Firmly press ball into a flat cake, first between your hands, then onto a clean cutting board. Use a spatula or other straight-edged tool to \"pull in\" the sides of the patty so that they remain together and tight.  Form patties about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick. Make the diameter about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) larger than the bun to allow for shrinkage. Build a hot fire in the grill. Lightly oil the bars with vegetable oil - pour oil onto a paper towel, then hold the towel with tongs to wipe the oil onto the grill bars. Place the burgers on the grill over direct heat. Cook about 3 to 4 minutes per side, turning once. Do not press down on the burgers with the spatula during cooking - this only squeezes out the juices, encourages flame-ups and dries out the burger. Check doneness by peeking inside a patty with a spatula, or use an instant-read food thermometer inserted into the center of the patty. (See Warnings for recommended temperature.)
