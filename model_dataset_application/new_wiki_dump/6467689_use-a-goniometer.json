          "description":"A goniometer has two arms: one that\u2019s attached to the circle with the angle degrees on it, and a movable arm that does the measuring. Make sure you understand how the moving arm points to the angle degrees so that you\u2019re able to measure the range of motion accurately. Once the moving arm of the goniometer is aligned with the moving limb, you'll look at the goniometer to see the angle degree that the moving arm is pointing to."

The center is the round section attached to the stationary arm. Aligning the fulcrums of both the goniometer and the joint will ensure an accurate measurement. For example, if you\u2019re measuring the hip joint, the center of the goniometer should be placed right where the hip joint is, in the center of your hip."

If you were measuring your knee\u2019s range of motion, the fulcrum of the goniometer would be on the fulcrum of your knee joint, with the stationary arm of the goniometer aligned with your thigh.

For example, hold your arm in place while bending your wrist forwards. The hand would be the limb that\u2019s about to be measured, and you\u2019d be keeping the arm stable and unmoving."

Hold the goniometer to the side of the knee joint and align the arms on either side, with the moving arm aligned with the moving leg. The average knee extension should be 0 degrees (when your leg is in a straight line), while the average flexion is roughly 135 degrees.

Measure the knee\u2019s extension and flexion using the goniometer. To measure the hyper extension of the knee, have the person lay flat on their back on a stable surface with the leg extended as straight as possible. To measure flexion, the person needs to lay on their stomach, bending the knee so that their leg is pulled toward their back as far as it will go. Hold the goniometer to the side of the knee joint and align the arms on either side, with the moving arm aligned with the moving leg.
