However, roller blinds require fairly substantial brackets. Before considering recessed blinds, measure the depths from the front face of the window frame to the horizontal rails and vertical stiles \u2014 the thin strips of trim that hold the window glass in place. Take several measurements for each window in your bay, and use the smallest measurement as your point of reference.

Use the smallest width measurement you get for each window, then subtract \u215c of an inch (1 cm) to be on the safe side. Use these measurements when ordering custom roller blinds, or if you're looking for the closest fit amongst in-stock blinds. Recessed blinds are a good choice for either box (right-angle) or angled bay windows.
