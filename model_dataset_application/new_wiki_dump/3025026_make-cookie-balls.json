  "text":" Oreo Cookie Balls Gather the ingredients. You'll need:\n1 8-ounce package cream cheese, softened\n36 Oreo cookies, crushed finely\n16 oz semi-sweet baking chocolate, melted Add the cream cheese and cookie crumb mixture to a mixing bowl. Stir to combine well. Shape into 1-inch/2.5cm balls. This will result in around 48 cookie balls. Place each ball onto a baking sheet lined with wax paper. Slide the baking sheet of cookie balls into the freezer. Allow to firm for 10 minutes, then remove. Dip the balls into the melted chocolate. Return to the wax paper-lined baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator. Chill the balls for at least one hour, or until firm. Serve. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Sugar Cookie Balls Gather the ingredients. You'll need:\n1 16-ounce packet sugar cookie dough\n1.5 ounce cream cheese, room temperature\n4 oz milk or white melting chocolate or 1 cup milk or white chocolate chips\n1 tablespoon butter, margarine or oil\nSprinkles (garnish, optional). Bake the cookies. Follow the instructions given on the dough packet. Allow to cool completely before making into cookie balls. Prepare a cookie sheet. Line it with either wax paper or a silicone baking mat. Put the cookies into the food processor. Break them up as you add them, to ease the processing. Then process until fine crumbs are formed. Add the cream cheese to the cookie crumbs. Keep processing to combine into a firm dough. Using your fingers, roll the mixture into balls about 1 inch/2.5cm across. Place each ball onto the prepared cookie sheet as they're made. Then either chill on the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour, or freeze for 10 to 15 minutes. This will cause the balls to firm up. Melt the chocolate and shortening together. You can either do this in the microwave or over the stove, depending on what you prefer. Place a ball sitting on a fork. Dunk the ball into the melted chocolate and cover with chocolate. Tap off excess chocolate as it drips, on the side of the bowl or saucepan. Place each dipped ball back onto the prepared cookie sheet. Continue until all of the balls have been covered. Add sprinkles if using. Alternatively, add desiccated coconut, cocoa powder or confectioners sugar. Let sit at room temperature until set. If it's warm, set in the refrigerator. Serve. They're now ready to eat. They can be stored in an airtight container in a cool place or in the refrigerator, for a few days. Making Baked Cookie Balls - General Instructions Have a pan ready for you to put the cookies in the oven. Make sure that a piece of parchment paper is over the pan, so that the dough doesn't get stuck. Use cookie dough that is firm. When baking, the dough must be firm, otherwise it tends to flatten during cooking. You may need to experiment a few times before getting the ball shape working. Sloppy dough will not keep its shape. Shape the cookie balls. Shape balls quickly; dough for baking can harden fast. If you have a scoop, use that to roll the dough into balls. Make sure the dough is tightly packed into the scoop, or it won't come out as a compacted cookie. Squeeze the lever until the dough comes out onto the plastic wrap. If you don't have a scoop, use your fingers. Take a small handful of dough and begin shaping it, very gently, with your fingers. Don't press too hard, though; it may break. Keep shaping it until you are satisfied, and transfer it to the parchment paper. Make sure the cookie balls are spread far apart from one another. If they are too close together in the oven, they will stick together, and will form one giant cookie instead of separate balls. Baked Cookie Balls Gather the ingredients. You'll need:\n1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose or plain flour. 1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n1/8 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 cup brown sugar\n3/4 stick/125g stick butter, softened at room temperature\n1 tablespoon sugar\n1 egg\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Add the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda to a mixing bowl. Whisk to combine. Add the sugars and butter to another mixing bowl. Beat until light and fluffy, using an electric mixer. Add the egg and vanilla extract. Mix in thoroughly. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Mix well until combined. The resulting dough will be very firm and will seem dry; that's expected. Do not mix too much. Add the chocolate chips and fold through gently.  Scoop small 1-inch/2.5cm wide dough balls. Place straight onto the baking sheet. When you have transferred all of the dough, place in the freezer. Let freeze for 30 minutes minimum, preferably 1 hour. This freezing process makes it more likely that the balls will stay in a ball shape during baking. Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF/200\u00baC. Remove the balls from the freezer.
