  "text":" Making a One-Handed Gun Turn your hand into the shape of a gun. Make a fist with your hand. Release your index finger so that it points straight out. Release your thumb so it points straight upward. This is the basic structure of the one-handed gun. Loop a rubber band under your little finger.

Stretch the rubber band around your thumb. Using your opposite hand, grab the loose end of the rubber band that hangs under your little finger. Stretch the rubber band over the back of your thumb. Pull the rubber band onto your index finger. Stretch the loose end of the rubber band past your thumb and let it rest on the tip of your index finger. Place it right in the middle of your fingertip so it doesn't slip off. Aim your gun. Aim the gun by pointing your index finger toward where you want the rubber band to go. Don't aim it at a person or anything that could be harmed by a flying rubber band. Fire the gun. Keep your index finger pointing straight forward and your thumb pointing straight upward.
