The arm connects the head to the base. There are no lenses on the microscope's arm. The eyepiece, or ocular, is what you look through to see the object beneath the microscope. The eyepiece tube holds the eyepieces in place. The nosepiece holds the objective lenses. The objective lenses are the main lenses of the compound microscope. There can be 3, 4 or 5 lenses on a compound microscope, depending on its level of complexity. The arm provides support for the microscope's head."

The focusing knobs may be either separate or coaxial (meaning the coarse focusing knob is on the same axis as the fine focusing knob.) The stage is where you place the slide holding the specimen. You can use a mechanical stage when working with higher magnifications. Make sure to use stage clips should when you adjust stages manually."

          "description":"The compound microscope provides its own light sources for optimal viewing. These light sources are in the base of the microscope. Light enters the stage through the aperture, which allows the light to reach the slide. The illuminator provides light for the microscope. Typically, the illuminator uses low-wattage halogen bulbs. Lighting is continuous and variable. A condenser collects and focuses the light from the illuminator. It's located beneath the stage, often together with the iris diaphragm. The condenser focus knob moves the condenser up and down to adjust the light. The iris diaphragm is located below the stage. Working together with the condenser, the iris diaphragm controls the focus and quantity of light provided to the specimen."

This will also protect the lens of your microscope from anything that might press against it. Position your sample between 2 pieces of glass to make a slide.

          "description":"Start with the lowest level of magnification. This will allow you to select the part of the specimen that offers the most interest. Once you've located this, you may increase the magnification to better view this part. Turn the nosepiece turret until the shortest lens (4x) is above your sample. It should click and feel rigid when it is in place. The shortest objective lens is the least powerful (the lowest level of magnification) and is the easiest level to begin when magnifying an object. Twist the coarse focus knob (the large one) on the side of the base so the stage moves upward toward the short objective lens. Perform this without looking into the eyepiece. It's important to make sure the slide does not touch the lens. Stop twisting the coarse knob just before the slide contacts the lens."

Move the specimen slide so that the image is in the center of your view. Arrange the illuminator until you've arrived at a comfortable level of light. The brighter the illuminator shines, the better you will be able to see your specimen. Twist the coarse focus knob the opposite way as you had before, so the stage moves away from the lens. Do this slowly until the sample begins to focus."

          "headline":"Magnify the image.",
          "description":"Use the coarse focus knob to get the specimen in view, and the fine focus knob to bring the adjusted slide into focus. You may need to reposition your slide as you magnify. When using a compound microscope, the correct viewing technique is to keep both eyes open. Look through the eyepiece with one eye, and look outside the microscope with the other eye. When you use the 10x lens to magnify the image, it may help to lower the amount of light for better clarity. Readjust your illuminator and iris diaphragm as needed. Switch lenses by rotating the nose piece turret to a longer lens. Perform necessary focusing adaptations. Once you've found a clear image, change to a higher power objective lens. This should be a simpler process, requiring only minimal use of the focusing adjustment. If you can't focus on your specimen, repeat the steps suggested above."

Always turn off the power when you're finished using your microscope. Lower the stage, remove your specimen and cover the equipment with a dust-repellent cover. Avoid touching any lens or glass with your fingers. Always carry the microscope carefully with both hands."
