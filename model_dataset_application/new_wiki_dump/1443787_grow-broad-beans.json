          "description":"Depending on where you live, you may want to plant your broad beans in the late autumn, after you've cleaned up your garden from the summer, which means you'll be harvesting them sometime in the spring when you're ready to start planting other plants. In regions with very cold winters, however, waiting until spring is essential. Temperate zones: In most regions, you'll want to start broad beans in the early spring to ensure a late summer harvest. Broad beans like to be planted between 60\u2109 and 65\u2109 (15-18\u2103), and struggle in temperatures higher than 80\u2109 (27\u2103). Warm Mediterranean climates: Let plants winter-over in areas with mild winters. Fava beans can stay healthy down to temperatures of about 15 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C), making them a good candidate for overwintering in some climates. Because of the long maturation period, planting broad beans in late autumn can ensure that you're harvesting in early spring. Cold or very hot zones: Start beans indoors in regions with sudden shifts in temperature. If you live in the American Midwest or the Southeast, the transition from winter to summer is often sudden enough that it puts a strain on broad bean varieties, making it a better choice to start your plants indoors, several weeks before putting them in the ground."

Fill the tubes \u2154 to \u00be full with potting soil. You'll probably spill some in between, but don't worry about the mess. Place one bean on top of the soil in each tube.

For this reason, it's important to plant stakes along your broad bean row to use to support them when they start to gain height. Use small dowels spaced every foot or two along the row, with twine tied between, to give the plants something to lean on. You can use twine, or old strips of bed-sheet to gently tie the plants and keep them upright and keep the pods off the ground. Don't wait until you've got a huge plant and it's flopping over to stake them.

Row covers are plastic or cloth sheets that you can stake gently, draped over the plants. This leaves enough room for growth and air circulation, and also warmth. Row covers can also be a great idea if you're planting in the autumn, because it will help trap the heat near the ground and protect the plants from frost. If you use a row cover, leave the rows uncovered for a while in the middle of the day, maybe while you're weeding to let the air circulate more readily.

Broad beans are notable for the waxy outer shell on each bean, but harvested young those outer shells will be soft and edible. Look for a narrow pod that's bright green. The pods should be thin and narrow, showing none of the bulges that are the sign of mature beans on the inside. If beans are showing, let them mature fully. Don't over-pick your young beans, since the full-grown variety is where the flavor's at. It's ok to pick a few from each plant if you can't wait, but save the majority for full maturation."

The pods will appear to plump some and begin to droop with the weight of the seeds when they're ready to harvest. Depending on what variety you're growing, pods can be anywhere from 6 to 15 inches long, with several large, fat beans on the inside, with several pods per plant. If you pick them regularly throughout the season, you should open up space for more production as well, if you're had a good growing season, weather-wise."

Again, depending on the variety, each bean should have 5-10 large beans in each pod, which have a thick waxy shell that needs removed before eating. It takes some work, but getting organized can help to make the process go fast. The easiest way to do this is to blanch them, dropping the beans in boiling water for a count of five, then removing them immediately with a slotted spoon and putting them right into ice water. This will loosen the shells on each bean."

Row covers are plastic or cloth sheets that you can stake gently, draped over the plants. This leaves enough room for growth and air circulation, and also warmth. Row covers can also be a great idea if you're planting in the autumn, because it will help trap the heat near the ground and protect the plants from frost. If you use a row cover, leave the rows uncovered for a while in the middle of the day, maybe while you're weeding to let the air circulate more readily. Watch for fungal disease and wet rot at the base of the plants. If you see any whitish or yellowish patches, water them less and expose the plants to more air. Watch out for aphids. Aphids love bean plants and will congregate usually at the top of the plants, near new shoots and buds. Some gardeners like to use insecticidal spray to keep aphids off the plants, but an easier method involves cutting the tops off the plants where the aphids congregate as you see them. If you're a diligent gardener, you should be able to pinch them off before they do much damage. Harvesting Broad Beans Harvest some early to eat them whole. Like other bush beans, broad beans can be tender and edible in the first couple days of their formation, eaten like sugar snap peas, or steamed whole as a side dish. Broad beans are notable for the waxy outer shell on each bean, but harvested young those outer shells will be soft and edible. Look for a narrow pod that's bright green. The pods should be thin and narrow, showing none of the bulges that are the sign of mature beans on the inside. If beans are showing, let them mature fully. Don't over-pick your young beans, since the full-grown variety is where the flavor's at. It's ok to pick a few from each plant if you can't wait, but save the majority for full maturation. Harvest mature beans when the pods are bright and not over-bulging. Broad beans are ready to be harvested when the pods and plump and the beans are fat and distinct in each pod. The pods will appear to plump some and begin to droop with the weight of the seeds when they're ready to harvest. Depending on what variety you're growing, pods can be anywhere from 6 to 15 inches long, with several large, fat beans on the inside, with several pods per plant. If you pick them regularly throughout the season, you should open up space for more production as well, if you're had a good growing season, weather-wise. Shuck the beans. To get at the broad beans, you've got to shuck them out of their pods. Holding each pod with the pointy tip up, pull the string along the side of each bean to open the pod. Again, depending on the variety, each bean should have 5-10 large beans in each pod, which have a thick waxy shell that needs removed before eating. It takes some work, but getting organized can help to make the process go fast. The easiest way to do this is to blanch them, dropping the beans in boiling water for a count of five, then removing them immediately with a slotted spoon and putting them right into ice water. This will loosen the shells on each bean. Enjoy the beans in soups, salads, and other dishes. The best way to cook broad beans is the most simple: steam them and serve them simply dressed with salt and pepper. They're big, meaty, and delicious, ideally paired with red meat. They're also a great base for bean soups, or as an addition to hearty salads. Return the whole plant to the soil when the beans finish. Because broad bean plants are great nitrogen-providers, it's a good idea to return them back to the soil and let their nutrients enrich the soil. Cut each plant down to the base and dig the roots into the soil. Cover them in soil and rotate your garden so something in need of nitrogen-enrichment is planted there next season.",
