Make sure to take bright, inviting pictures after you've gone through all the hard work of staging the house. If your REALTOR is taking pictures for you, ask to see the pictures they have selected for the online listing to make sure they meet your approval. You can always submit your own photos instead (or use a combination) if you don\u2019t like your REALTOR\u2019s photos. Your listing should include 25 photos. If you\u2019re trying to sell a more expensive property, consider bringing in a professional photographer and taking some overhead drone shots, as well."
