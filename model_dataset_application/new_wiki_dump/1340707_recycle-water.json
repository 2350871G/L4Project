Microfibers are non-biodegradable and they're often coated with chemicals, so it's important that you filter them out of your grey water before you use it in your garden. You can also use a microfiber laundry ball to collect loose microfibers in your laundry machine."

Keep grey water pipes clearly labeled and completely separate from clean water plumbing. Excess should drain into the sewage system, with a valve preventing backflow.

If you're in an area with a severely limited water supply, you may want to take advantage of this as well:\nThe kitchen is the most common source of dark water, containing grease, food contaminants, and powerful detergents from the dishwasher.
