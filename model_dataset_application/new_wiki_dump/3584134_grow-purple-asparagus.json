Make sure that it is fully in the sun with at least 6 hours a day of sun exposure. Avoid areas with poor air flow or where asparagus has been planted before."

Purple asparagus needs soil with a pH level between 6.5 and 7.0. Repeat the tests every three years to see if you need to make any changes to your asparagus bed. Amend the soil with lime if the pH level is too low. Till the lime deeply into the soil."
