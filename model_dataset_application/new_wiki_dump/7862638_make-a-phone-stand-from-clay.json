  "text":" Preparation Measure your phone's length and height. (Height of iPhone 6 is about 5.5 inches, and most Androids are 4.5 inches tall). Purchase suitable clay. The best clay for this project is air-dry clay, as it dries quickly and without having to fuss with heating. The remaining requirements for building this stand are listed under Things You'll Need below. Making the Base Take about a handful of clay. Mold it into a spherical shape. It does not have to be perfect. Flatten the sphere.  Mold the sphere into a neat square. Do this by cutting off the edges with the ruler. The size of the square is dependent on the size of your phone. Use the measurements made earlier to assist with this. Fold the edges up on three sides. Check that it is as long (horizontal) as your phone. Fold up one long side and the two short sides, leaving one long side unfolded (this side will be where the cradle is attached). Making the Cradle Take another, more generous handful clay. Once again mold it into a sphere. Make sure that this sphere is larger than the one made before. Flatten the sphere. This time, mold it into a rectangular shape, again using a ruler. Make sure it is the same length as the base. The size of the rectangle is dependent on the size of your phone. Use the measurements made earlier to assist with this. Hold the rectangle against the base, on the side not folded up. Use your finger to smooth one side of the rectangle into this side of the base. As you attach the cradle, ensure that it tilted at a slight angle, for holding the phone. Fold the edges upward, around the remaining sides of the rectangular cradle piece. This will prevent the phone from sliding off and keeps it in place. Take your phone and put it on the stand. Check for the need to make further adjustments, such as any widening, changes of angles or improving the edges, etc. When all adjustments have been made, you're ready to complete the project. Finishing Up Smooth the clay out using your thumbs or the clay smoother tool. It should appear even and neat all over the project. Add decorative effects, if wished. Using leftover clay, make fun things such as animals, objects like candy or shapes. Add anything you fancy to make your phone stand really pretty. Stick the clay shapes onto the stand.  Let the whole stand dry for about 48 hours or until stand is completely white. To test for dryness, you can stick your fingernail in the clay. If a nail print shows, the clay is not yet dry. Painting Choose the color(s) that you wish to use for the inside of the phone stand. You can try using one color for a simple look, it's up to you. If using more than one color, consider how to arrange or merge the colors so that they complement each other. Paint the inside of the stand. Use clean, neat strokes, being careful not to paint over any decorations. Take the color(s) you wish to use for the outside of the phone stand.  Paint the stand on the outside. Be careful to avoid painting over any decorations. Paint the decorations any color you want.  Add more decorative effects if wished. You can glue gems, add stickers, ribbons, etc., to personalize the phone stand. Allow the paint to dry completely before use. Test before putting your phone into the cradle and base of the stand. You are finished! Put the stand where it is most convenient and admire your handiwork.",
