          "description":"Copper wires are usually coated in a layer of plastic for insulation purposes. This is to protect users from electric shock. However, the battery cannot transfer electrons to the wire through the insulation. The coating needs to be removed. Using your wire strippers, remove a few centimeters of insulation from each end of the wire. Wire clippers look like a pair of scissors with a hole cut out in the middle. You feed the wire through this hole and pull the clippers across the wire to strip the insulation. You should get a wire stripper that's small enough to strip a very small bit of copper wire."

          "description":"Once you've prepared the wire, you can begin building your battery. To start, neatly wind the wire around your nail. The smaller loops you use, the stronger your battery will be. Be careful to leave enough wire on either end. You'll be attaching the excess wire to your battery, so it's a good idea to leave about 8 inches of loose wire on each end. You should wrap the wire in one direction. This assures that electrons can flow through a wire in a way that creates a magnetic field. If the wire is wrapped in opposite directions, magnetic fields will fight against each other. They will end up canceling each other out."

Make sure the portions of the wire that have been stripped of insulation are the ends touching the battery. Use your rubber band to strap the wires in place by wrapping the rubber band around the battery from the negative end to the positive end. It does not matter which end of the wire is connected to which end of the battery. It will work either way. If a rubber band is not holding the wires in place, you can use two pieces of masking tape instead."

The paperclip should rise up and attach to the battery. You have created a magnetic charge with the wire, nail, and battery. If you want to increase the strength of your battery, increase the number of coils running around your nail. This will allow your electromagnet to pick up more objects."

You may also have forgotten to remove the insulation from the wire."
