Flip the paper airplane over to create the wing on the other side. Once both sides are creased, unfold them slightly so the plane is flat on top. Make sure your wings are symmetrical to one another so your plane stays level when you throw it. Making an Advanced Plane Crease an 8 \u20442 in \u00d7 11 in (22 cm \u00d7 28 cm) piece of paper in half lengthwise. Use a piece of printer or construction paper for your paper airplane. Lay the paper on a flat surface and fold it in half lengthwise to create a long rectangle. Press down on the crease with your fingernail before unfolding the paper again. Try using different kinds of paper to add designs and test how it affects your plane. Bring the top corners toward the crease in the middle. Grab one of the top corners and fold it into a triangle so the edge lines up with the crease. Flatten the fold using your knuckle or fingernail so it holds in place. Repeat your fold on the other top corner so there\u2019s a point at the top of your paper. Make sure the crease you folded is pointing toward you when you start folding the paper, or else your folds won\u2019t line up. Fold the top point down so there\u2019s \u20442 in (1.3 cm) left on the bottom. Grab the top point of your paper and fold it down to hide the triangles you just made. Bring the point down until it\u2019s \u20442 in (1.3 cm) from the bottom of the sheet. Run your knuckle over the fold to secure it in place. Your piece of paper should look like an envelope. Don\u2019t let the point touch the bottom edge of your paper or it will affect the structure of your plane when you\u2019re finished. Bring the top corners toward the center. Grab one of the new corners you just made at the top of your paper. Fold the corner over so the edge lines up with the middle crease. Secure your fold by running your knuckle over it. Repeat the fold on the other side so there are 2 triangles. If you want your airplane to have a blunt edge in front instead of a point, fold the top of your paper so only the corners touch the center crease. Hold your folds in place by folding the bottom point over them. Crease the point closest to the bottom of your paper so it covers the 2 right angles along the center of your paper. Make sure the fold holds the triangles in place. Your paper should look like a large triangle on top of a narrow rectangle when you're finished. Fold the paper in half along the center crease.
