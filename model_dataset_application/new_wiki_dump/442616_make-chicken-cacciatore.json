          "description":"Remove the giblets from the chicken and pat it dry with a clean paper towel. Then, use a sharp paring knife to cut the chicken in half between the breasts. Cut off the legs, and divide each 1 into a thigh and a drumstick. Then, cut each of the chicken breasts in half so they are the same size and a wing is attached to each of them. If you prefer not to cut up a whole chicken, check your grocery store for pre-cut whole chickens. If desired, you may remove the skin from the chicken pieces. Removing the skin will reduce the amount of fat in the dish, but leaving the skin on will enhance the flavor of the dish. How to Replace Missing Ingredients \nUse beef or vegetable broth in place of chicken broth. You can use the same amount of broth that the recipe calls for, but use a different type of broth. Swap chicken for a different type of protein, such as pork, beef, duck, tofu, or chickpeas. Use an equal amount of a different protein if you don't have chicken on hand. Substitute lemon juice for white wine. Replace white wine with an equal amount of lemon juice, such as 4  fl oz (120 mL) of lemon juice in place of 4  fl oz (120 mL) of white wine."
