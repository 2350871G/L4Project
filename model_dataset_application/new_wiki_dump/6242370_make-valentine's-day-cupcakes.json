  "text":" Baking the Cupcakes Line your cake tin with cupcake cases. Pattern or gold looks cute, but if you only have white you could possibly use the kids to decorate them with non-toxic pens and doodle on the outsides only. Preheat the oven to; gas mark 4/ 170 degrees.  Mix 100g butter and the sugar together until it is creamy. A way to check this is that it should be quite pale; there should be no chunks of butter and the sugar should have magically 'disappeared'. Crack the eggs into the bowl and then add the food colouring and the cocoa powder.  Carefully fold in the flour.  Bake for 15-25 minutes or until golden brown. To check, poke a small skewer into a cupcake near the back or sides. If wet mixture comes out then it's not done. Be careful not to burn them. Making the Icing Mix the remaining butter and icing sugar together.  Spread over the cupcakes as soon as they are cool. Otherwise, it will run down the sides if the cupcakes are too warm still. Creating the Hearts Roll out the red and white icing separately.  Use the red to cut out the biggest hearts and firmly place them on the cupcakes. They should almost fill all the cupcakes' tops. Use the white icing to cut out a medium heart. Then use a little bit of icing to dab gently on the middle of the red heart to stick the white heart on. If you only have 2 sized cutters, skip to the next step. If you have three, cut out a third heart using the smallest cutter and again, dab a bit of icing onto the white heart and stick it on. Sprinkle your two or three layered hearts with edible glitter. You're done!",
