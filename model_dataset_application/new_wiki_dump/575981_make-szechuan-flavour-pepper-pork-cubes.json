  "text":" Peel the ginger root and chop. Cut some finely, and some into slices. Cut the pepper into strips.  Cut the green onion into short segments.  Chop the meat into roughly 5 centimeter (2.0 in) cubes (it is easier to do so while the meat is still frozen).  Put pork cubes, green onion segments, and ginger slices in one bowl.  Pour in the sugar, cooking wine, light soy sauce and the starch.  Use your hand or chopsticks to agitate the ingredients until thoroughly mixed.  Let the marinating last 20 to 30 minutes (the longer time it marinates, the more tastes the meat will absorb from its companies. The saturation may be reached after one to two hours). At the same time, peel broccoli--however in this dish, we only use the crest part.  Steam broccoli for about 10 minutes, till it begins to turn soft; then scatter some salt on it.  Now the marinating ends. Take out ginger roots, and green onions. Prepare to cook meat. Set the electric range temperature at MAX (or 10).  Wait until the corn oil gets hot, pour in the meat. Stir till it just turns white or pink. Take out the meat, and refill the pan with a few drops of corn oil.  Set the electric range temperature at 3 or 4.  Pour in the ginger grains, pepper strips, and Szechuan peppers. Fry them till the Szechuan peppers begin to turn black. Now your kitchen should be filled with a strong spicy smell. Put back the meat into the pan, and set the temperature to MAX.  Quickly stir the meat with the peppers for about one minute. The gravy will become like molasses. Turn off the electric range.  Scatter a few drops of sesame oil, and keep stirring till very well mixed.  The final step: put the meat and gravy in a plate, and decorate the side by broccoli crests. ",
