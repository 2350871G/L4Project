          "description":"As a general rule, chilli seeds need a temperature of 23-30 degrees Celsius (73-86 degrees Fahrenheit) to germinate. Place your seeds in a spot with consistent warmth (e.g. on a heated mat) for a period of 2-5 days, until they swell or sprout. Make sure that the heat source isn't hot enough to melt the zip lock bag or plastic container that your seeds are stored in. Pre-germinating the chilli seeds this way before planting them in compost or soil will give them a better chance of sprouting successfully. In warmer climates, the seeds can be left outdoors to germinate, provided that the temperature does not drop below 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit)."
