Since the game will be played over the course of a few days or weeks, set up the board in a convenient location that others will not disturb. Place all of the pieces in their respective positions. The back row of pieces is ordered from left to right as follows: Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook. The white queen must be placed on a white square; the black queen must be placed on a black square. The front row of pieces contains eight pawns."

It is tempting to use this advantage to skew the game towards one side or the other. Doing so, however, is not beneficial to your development as a player. In order to improve your skills through solo chess, you must remain indifferent about what side wins the game. Master chess players, while aware of their opponent\u2019s strategy, always strive to make the best move possible."

In order to castle, all of the spaces between your unmoved king and an unmoved rook must be open. Slide your king two spaces towards the unmoved rook. Place the rook behind the king (between the king\u2019s starting square and his new position). If your opponent fails to castle, look for an opportunity to capture their king."
