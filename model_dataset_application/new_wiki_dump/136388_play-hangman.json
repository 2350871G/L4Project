  "text":" Playing Basic Hangman Choose one person to be the \"host.\" This is the person that invents the puzzle for the other person to solve. They will be tasked with choosing a word or phrase that \"the players\" will have to solve. The host should be able to spell confidently or the game will be impossible to win. If you are the host, choose a secret word. The other players will need to guess your word letter by letter, so choose a word you think will be difficult to guess. Difficult words usually have uncommon letters, like \"z,\" or \"j,\" and only a few vowels. For longer games, you can also choose phrases. Draw a blank line for each letter in the word. For example, if the executioner chooses the word \"zipper,\" she/he would draw six blanks, one for each letter ( _ _ _ _ _ _ ). The host does not tell anyone else the secret word. Start guessing letters if you are the player. Once the word has been chosen and the players know how many letters in the secret word, begin guessing which letters are in the word by asking the host.
