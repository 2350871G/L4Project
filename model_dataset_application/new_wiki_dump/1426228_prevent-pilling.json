          "description":"Excessive wear can cause pilling, especially if the garment doesn't have time to rest in between. To prevent this from happening, give clothes at least 24 hours to rest and return to their original shapes before putting them on again. This includes sweaters, shirts, pajamas, and other garments. Wearing garments too often can cause pilling because when you wear an article of clothing, the fibers tend to stretch. This can cause the shorter threads in the yarns to come loose, and then they tangle and pill."

Anywhere that the backpack has contact with your clothes or body is likely to pill, such as the back, shoulders, and under the arms. Instead of a backpack, use a handbag that you can carry, a suitcase, or a wheeled carry-on bag."

          "description":"Purses can also cause friction and pilling, especially in the shoulder area. When you carry a purse, carry it in your hand instead of on your shoulder if you're worried about pilling. Over-the-shoulder bags, messenger bags, and other accessories that you wear against your body can all cause pilling too."

There are a number of actions that can cause rubbing and friction, and all of them should be avoided, including:\nResting elbows against a table when you're working or eating\nSliding around on the floor (can cause pilling on socks or the seat of your pants)\nCrawling on your knees when you're wearing pants\nSitting on rough surfaces"

But this is another instance of rubbing that can cause pilling, and it should be avoided. To treat stains on fabrics that pill, place the stained fabric on top of an old towel or clean rag. Apply a stain remover of your choice, and then blot the area with a clean towel. The stain will transfer to the towel below without causing friction."

When this happens, the Velcro can pull shorter threads loose, and then they're at risk of pilling.

To prevent unsightly pilling on the outside of garments, turn them inside out before throwing them into the washing machine and before handwashing. Pills may still form if the garments are inside out, but they will be on the inside of the garment, so they won't be visible. To prevent pilling on the inside and outside of the garment, place pill-prone items into a garment bag before washing."

To hand wash clothes and other materials:\nFill a sink or bucket with water that's the right temperature for the fabric\nAdd detergent and agitate the water to create suds\nSoak the item for at least five minutes\nSwish the item around in the water, but do not rub the material together\nRemove the item from the sink and squeeze out excess water"

When you wash clothes in these detergents, the enzymes dissolve the small weak fibers that pills might form on. When looking for enzyme detergents, look for ingredients like cellulase, amylase, pectinase, and protease, which break down sugars and carbohydrates, proteins, and other molecules. Powder detergents can be abrasive. Liquid detergents will cause less rubbing, and reduce pilling that occurs in the wash."

Instead, hang clothes, bedsheets, and other laundry items to air dry. During the warmer months, hang clothes on an outdoor line for the fastest drying time. In winter, you can hang clothes to dry inside, but keep a window slightly open and the room well ventilated to avoid moisture buildup in the air."
