          "description":"Time and time again realtors stress that a fresh coat of paint is the easiest way to increase the value of your home. That said, a bright purple room may be off-putting to potential buyers. Go for neutral tones like beige or muted green with simple white baseboards to appeal to a wide range of buyers. If you are on a budget then paint the most commonly used rooms first, like the kitchen, living room, and main bathroom. Avoid both bright colors like pink or yellow and dark shades like navy or chocolate brown, as these are polarizing choices for certain buyers."

          "description":"Wallpaper is a big turn-off for potential buyers because it is a hassle to remove if they don\u2019t like it. Stick to neutral paint colors to get the maximum value for your house. Some wallpaper, especially in small rooms, can be effective if chosen correctly. Stick to calm, simple patterns over big and bold images."

          "description":"A 2007 HomeGain survey found that lighting was the number one thing potential buyers used to separate good homes from great ones. You can add attractive lighting in a variety of ways:\nInstall mood-enhancing dimmer switches. Put in a skylight or sun tubes (glass holes in the roof that allow in sunlight) to bring light in naturally. Remove large and stuffy curtains. Replace old light bulbs with energy-efficient LEDs for a clean, modern look without breaking the bank."

          "headline":"Invest in new appliances.",
          "description":"A new oven, washing machine, or fridge tells a buyer that the home is up-to-date. Old appliances, however, can signal that your home is in need of costly repairs or improvements, lowering value. Buy one new appliance if you can\u2019t afford multiple. Having one shiny, high-end appliance like a dishwasher gives the impression that all of your appliances are high end. However, a new stainless steel oven will look odd if the rest of the appliances nearby in are worn, retro styles. If you are on a budget, look up new \"faces\" for your appliances. Often the front plate of an oven or dishwasher can be removed and replaced with a new one if you call your manufacturer and ask for a replacement."

Rip up the old flooring and add tile, clean wood floors, or a new carpet. Spending $1,000 on a new floor increase your home value by $2,000. Start in \"high-value\" rooms like the kitchen or the living room if you want new floors. These are the first rooms many buyers notice. Get tile for small, frequently dirty floors (bathroom/kitchen), hardwood for the living or dining spaces, and carpet or wood for bedrooms. Recent trends have shied away from carpets, as most consumers now prefer hardwood floors."

The more question marks you eliminate for potential buyers the more likely you are to sell your house for the right price. Some quick fixes include:\nNew rug for the entryway. New lighting fixtures. New faucets and handles. Clean and re-grout tiles in the kitchen and bathroom."

This is the room most buyers focus on, and you can expect to get up to 85% of your remodeling costs back when the house sells. A fresh coat of paint that hides splash marks can cheaply update a kitchen. Find or buy a place to tuck away your dishes and cookbooks to make your kitchen look clean and spacious"

New cabinets can completely transform a room for the better, giving the appearance that the whole room had a makeover. For a cheaper fix, hire a resurfacing company to clean and stain your old cabinets, making them look like they just came from the hardware store.

Homeowners like big, wide-open floor plans because they can imagine how their own stuff will fill the house when they move in. Knock down inessential walls. Remove the island in the middle of the kitchen to open up the house. Install swinging French doors to allow airflow between rooms like the kitchen and dining room."

Finishing the basement, however, can reap rewards when it is time for resale. If you have the money, consider adding additional rooms to your house. Larger houses, without fail, sell for more money. Additions, however, are expensive to construct and may take several months to complete. In general, improving your current house will lead to a greater return on your investment than adding new sections."

Solar panels make your house seem modern and cutting-edge, and signal to potential buyers that they will save money after they\u2019ve bought the house. Solar panels can lead to tax breaks for homeowners, which will quickly increase the value of your house. On the other hand, solar panels might be a big concern for the buyer. If you're paying high lease rates to a third party, when the panels break, who will fix them? Also, the cheap imported panels are being leased for 20 years, but they sometimes only last for five to eight years."

Not only does new siding usually give your house a facelift, but it usually helps with insulation and heating costs. Upscale siding, like fiber-cement boards of PVC lumber, can actually make you money on a sale, often returning 3-5% profit."

Eventually cracks will appear and the brick walls will become loose. The process of fixing the old mortar and restoring the brick walls to their original condition is called repointing. It involves removing the old mortar and replacing it with new mortar. Done right, brick pointing will ensure a home\u2019s integrity for at least 40 years. Brick repointing enhances the visual attractiveness of the house and it will increase the likelihood of more people liking the property which in turn will create competition on price. Having a visually attractive house to sell will roughly increase the price with 2-5%."

This only costs a few hundred dollars, but an attractive lawn brings in more buyers and drives the value of your home up before anyone even steps through the front door.

Use \"Weed & Feeds\" which are specially formulated products that fertilize grass and kills weeds, to get rid of small patches of weeds and water your grass at least 1-2 a week.

Cut your grass regularly so that it is trim and clean looking. Pull up any weeds the flower beds. Use a weed whacker to trim away tall grass next to the house, driveway, and walkways."
