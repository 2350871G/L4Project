If the child\u2019s mother has her baby\u2019s room decked out in animal print or loves pink, pay homage to her design choice by picking fabrics that matches her taste. Make sure you have enough fabric to create a 3\u201d, 5\u201d and 7\u201d square (front and back). Purchase thread that will compliment the fabric style. Also, if you are hand sewing the toy, don\u2019t forget to pick up sewing needles. Find a sharp pair of sewing scissors and a measuring tape to help you with precise fabric measurements.
