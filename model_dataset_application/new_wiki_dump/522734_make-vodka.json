          "description":"Vodka is commonly made from wheat, rye, barley, corn, or potatoes. Sugar and molasses can also be used alone or added to other ingredients. One distiller even makes an innovative vodka from Pinot Noir red wine. Whatever you choose, it must have sugars or starches so that alcohol is ultimately produced. Yeast eats sugars or starches and spits out alcohol and carbon dioxide. When making vodka from grains and potatoes, a mash must be made that contains active enzymes that break down the starches from the grains or potatoes and makes fermentable sugars. Fruit juice already contains sugars so starch-degrading enzymes are not needed. As with fruit juice, vodka made from store-bought sugars need only be fermented, thus bypassing the need for a mash. When already fermented mediums such as wine are used, the medium can be distilled right away into vodka."

If you\u2019re using grains and potatoes, you\u2019ll need additional enzymes. Grains and potatoes are sources of starch, so enzymes are needed to break the starch down into sugar. If you\u2019re using malted whole grains, you do not need additional enzymes. Malted whole grains, like malted barley or malted wheat, are rich in natural enzymes that break down starches into fermentable sugars. If you\u2019re using refined sugar and molasses, you do not need additional enzymes because the sugar is already present."

          "description":"Food-grade amylase enzyme powder can be purchased from a homebrew shop and added to the mash to convert the starch into fermentable sugars, if you're using potatoes, for example. Use the recommended amount for the amount of starch to be broken down. There is no need to use malted, enzyme-rich grains such as malted barley or wheat when using enzyme powder. For enzymes to be able to break down starches, the starches must first be gelatinized. Flaked (rolled) grains are often already gelatinized. Un-gelatinized ingredients such as potatoes and unrolled or malted grains are heated in water to the gelatinization temperature of the particular starch that is used. Potatoes usually gelatinize at about 150\u00b0 F (66\u00b0 C), and barley and wheat gelatinize at about the same temperature. Theoretically, a potato mash should only need to be heated to 150\u00b0 F (66\u00b0 C). If a low temperature is used with potatoes, the potatoes should be finely shredded before adding them to the water. Starch-degrading enzymes only work at specific temperatures and are destroyed at high temperatures. A temperature of 150\u00b0 F (66\u00b0 C) is common, but temperatures above 158\u00b0 F (70\u00b0 C) will result in the destruction of the enzymes. The absolute maximum temperature is 165\u00b0 F (74\u00b0 C)."

The absolute maximum temperature is 165\u00b0 F (74\u00b0 C). Making Different Mashes Try a wheat mash. In a 10 gallon (38 L) metal pot with lid, heat 6 gallons (23 L) of water to about 165\u00b0 F (74\u00b0 C). Add 2 gallons (7.6 L) of dry, flaked wheat and stir. Check the temperature and ensure that it is between 150\u00b0 F (66\u00b0 C) and 155\u00b0 F (68\u00b0 C). Stir in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of crushed wheat malt. The temperature should be about 149\u00b0 F (65\u00b0). Cover and let rest for 90 minutes to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. The starches should convert into fermentable sugars during this time, and the mixture should become much less viscous. After 90 minutes to 2 hours, cool the mixture to 80\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 F (27\u00b0 to 29\u00b0 C). Use an immersion chiller for rapid cooling or just let it cool overnight, but don\u2019t let it get much below 80\u00b0 F (27\u00b0 C). Go for a potato mash. Clean 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of potatoes. Without peeling, boil them in a large kettle until gelatinized, about one hour. Discard the water and thoroughly mash the potatoes by hand or with a food processor. Return the mashed potatoes to the kettle and add 5 to 6 gallons (19 to 23 L) of tap water. Mix to blend and bring mixture to just over 150\u00b0 F (66\u00b0 C). Add 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of crushed, malted barley or wheat and stir well. Cover and stir periodically over the course of 2 hours. Let it cool overnight to 80\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 F (27\u00b0 to 29\u00b0 C). Letting it cool for a long period of time also gives the barley malt enzymes more time to break down the potato starch. Make a corn mash. Make a mash according to the wheat mash recipe, but substitute flaked, pre-gelatinized corn (maize) for the flaked wheat. Alternatively, sprout your own corn over the course of 3 days and make a mash from it without added malted grain. A root about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long should sprout from each grain. The sprouted corn will contain enzymes that were formed during the germination (sprouting) process. Fermenting the Alcohol Clean all your utensils and prepare the area properly.

Lids can be affixed to buckets, as can drilled rubber stoppers to carboys, but when using a lid or a stopper, never seal the vessel completely, as pressure from carbon dioxide production will create explosive pressure.

This is called the \u201cbody\u201d or the \u201cheart.\u201d During this time, if using a column still with flowing cold water, the water flow can be adjusted to control the distillate output and purity. Aim for 2 to 3 teaspoons (9.8 to 14.8 mL) of distillate per minute. Increased distillate output results in decreased purity. Throw out the tails. Towards the end of the distillation process, when the temperature creeps up to 212\u00b0 F (100\u00b0 C) and beyond, the distillation process produces other nasty chemicals. These are called the \u201ctails,\u201d which contain fusel alcohols. The tails are undesirable as they contain propanol and butanol and should be discarded. Always make sure to throw out the tails, as they should not be consumed! Check the alcohol content and purity of the distillate. Cool a sample of the distillate to 68\u00b0 F (20\u00b0 C) and use an alcometer to measure the percentage of alcohol of the distillate. The distillate may be too diluted to serve as acceptable vodka (weaker than 40% alcohol), or may be more concentrated than desired (perhaps higher than 50% alcohol). Vodka is usually diluted before bottling, so the distillate may have a very high alcohol content. The distillate may also be too flavorful and aromatic and require additional distillations or carbon filtering. Redistill the liquid, if necessary or desired. This increases the alcohol content and further purifies the distillate. It is common to redistill the distillate 3 or more times to achieve vodka that has a high purity. Keep in mind that the heads and tails need to be discarded each time you distill the vodka! Premium brands of vodka go through 4 or 5 distillates, and most other brands go through 3 before the vodka is diluted and bottled. Adding the Finishing Touches Filter the vodka through carbon. Pass the distillate through an activated carbon filter, such as those available at homebrewing shops, to remove unwanted volatile flavors and aromas. Carbon water filters can also be modified to purify the distillate. Dilute the vodka to the desired strength. Add purified water to the distillate to attain the desired alcohol percentage. Use an alcometer to measure the alcohol percentage several times throughout this process until you achieve the desired strength. Bottle the vodka. Fill bottles using a gravity bottle filler setup and cork or cap the bottles. Label the bottles with custom labels if desired. Some gravity fillers may consist of a 7.5 gallon (29 L) bottling bucket (with spigot), vinyl tubing, and a simple spring-loaded plastic bottle filler. Multiple-spout wine bottle fillers can also be used.",
