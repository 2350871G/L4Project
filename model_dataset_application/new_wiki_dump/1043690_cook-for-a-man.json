          "description":"Ask your partner if he has a free evening in the next few weeks. Tell him that you would like to have him over for dinner. Try to choose a night where you will have the house to yourself. Try to avoid having children or flatmates home, as this might ruin the romantic mood. Weekends work well because you won\u2019t have the time pressure of needing an early night before work the next day. If you know that your partner is free on a certain date, you could write him a cute note inviting him for dinner and leave it on his pillow or in his letterbox. If you want to surprise your partner, plan the evening for a time that you are scheduled to hang out or a time where you know he will be free."

          "description":"The best way to know what someone likes to eat is to ask them. If he doesn\u2019t give you a very clear answer, try to suggest a food group such as Asian, Turkish, or Mexican. If he responds positively to one of your suggestions, you can rest assured that a meal from that category will be a safe choice. If he still isn\u2019t clear about what kind of food he likes, ask him what his favorite food is. If you want to surprise him, make something that you have eaten together before. That way, you know he will like the meal. Ask in general conversation if he has any allergies."

          "headline":"Ask him if there is anything he doesn't eat.",
          "description":"This is important because preparing a meal that he doesn\u2019t like will make you both feel awkward. When you invite him for dinner, take the opportunity to ask if there are any foods that he doesn\u2019t like. Ask if he has any allergies. A trip to the emergency room because of an allergy isn\u2019t going to be a fun way to end a romantic evening."

          "description":"Look through a cookbook or search online for a recipe. Choose a recipe that is appropriate for your cooking skill level. It is better to cook something simple rather than have a cooking disaster whilst cooking something fancy. Choosing a recipe in advance will allow you to write a list before you go shopping. If you are a beginner-intermediate cook, you could try making baked turkey wings or slow cooked chicken thighs, served with buttery mashed potatoes and a garden salad. Side dishes are great because they will help to bulk out the meal. Consider making a dessert. Ice cream served with fresh fruit is an easy and delicious option. Apple crumble is another yummy option. Check that the recipe serves at least 2 people as a main meal. It is always better to have too much food rather than not enough. Avoid serving soup or salad as the main meal. Choose a more hearty meal instead."

          "description":"If you are a still feeling unsure about what to make, a hearty Italian meal is likely to be a good option. Italian meals are easy to cook and will leave you feeling full. Both lasagne and spaghetti are easy and delicious options. If your partner can\u2019t eat gluten, there are plenty of gluten-free pasta options you can use instead. These can be purchased in the health food section of your supermarket."

Buy any fresh vegetables or meat 1-2 days before you plan to make the meal. Cooking with fresh ingredients will make the meal taste its best. Either buy or borrow any cooking supplies you don\u2019t have. Most recipes will require a sharp knife, saucepan, and measuring cups or spoons. Store your meat and vegetables in the fridge until you are ready to use them."

Prepare these components of the meal first so that they will be ready in time for your meal. Roasts, casseroles, and stews take several hours to cook. While these are in the oven, you will have time to prepare your side dishes. If your dish is cooking on the stove, make sure to keep an eye on it to ensure it doesn\u2019t burn or accidentally catch fire. Check the cooking time for the longest dish.

Prepare the side dishes that don\u2019t need to be kept warm first. If you are making a dessert, consider how long it needs to cook. Aim for it to be done about 30 minutes after dinner."

Turn on your warming drawer and transfer the dishes there until dinner. If you don\u2019t have a warming drawer, use an oven instead. Set your oven to 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C) and transfer your dishes onto a rack. Always use ovenproof dishes when keeping food warm. Avoid leaving the food in the oven or warming drawer for more than 15 minutes as this will affect its quality."
