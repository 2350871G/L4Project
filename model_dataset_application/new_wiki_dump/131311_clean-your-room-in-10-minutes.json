Don't use a dry rag; instead, buy wood cleaners or simply use a wet rag in warm water and a mild soap. Cleaning this way will prevent dust from flying around the room as you clean. In the doorway of the room, spritz a bit of nice-smelling perfume and waft it around with your hand so when people walk in they smell something nice."

      "description":"If you vacuum before you dust, the dust will settle and you'll have to vacuum again. Nothing gives a better impression of a clean room than freshly-vacuumed rugs. Buy a perfumed vacuum powder to improve the overall smell of the room as you clean. This will save you time in the long run. Don't bother vacuuming curtains or upholstery. It takes too much time and pulls you away from other, more important tasks. To kill odors on carpets and upholstery, spray them lightly with a solution of 1 part white vinegar:5 parts water solution."
