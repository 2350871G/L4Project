Drill 1/4\" holes half-way into the 37\" posts, 15 1/3\" from the bottom, then 14 1/6\" from the bottom. Glue and then insert dowels into the holes.

Line up this piece with the seat piece on the side that has the notches. Mark the locations of the dowel holes from the 1x4 onto the seat piece between the two notches. Drill 1/4\" dowel holes there as well. Drill 1/4\" dowel holes, centered, into each of your 3 pieces created from the 1x4.

Cut three pieces of 14\" 1x4, and cut a 12\" piece of 1x4 into 3 pieces. Cut a 17x17\" square from the plywood for the seat. Then cut 1.5\"x1.5\" notches out of two of the corners of the board, to make room for the back posts. Drill 1/4\" dowel holes into one of the 1x4s at the edge on one of the long sides (one hole centered and the other two 4 1/3\" from each end of the board). Line up this piece with the seat piece on the side that has the notches. Mark the locations of the dowel holes from the 1x4 onto the seat piece between the two notches. Drill 1/4\" dowel holes there as well. Drill 1/4\" dowel holes, centered, into each of your 3 pieces created from the 1x4. Drill centered pilot holes in your posts for your decking screws 1 3/4\" from the top of the short posts and 14 3/4 from the bottom of your tall posts. Build the chair back. Glue and insert dowels into both ends of the 3 pieces created from the 1x4. Then, insert them into the 1x4 and into the seat back. Allow the glue to set before proceeding. Insert the back/seat combination. Glue and then position the seat in place with the two side pieces below it, the back posts fit snugly into their notches.

Join a 12\" section of pipe with a 18\" section of pipe using a T joint. Cap both ends in L joints. Make a second, identical piece. Join these two sides together at the L joint on end closer to the T joint using a 26\" pieces of pipe. Make a separate piece with a T joint at the center and two 12\" pieces. Then, join at the upper ends together with this piece. All pieces should be dry fit before doing any trimming. Your end shape should be a rectangle. If your pieces aren't fitting together right, they can be trimmed down. The long side T joints should be facing into the inside of the rectangle. The upper T joint will need to be adjusted but will likely be around a 45 degree angle from the line of the long side. Create the joint. Place a 2\" section of pipe into the long side T joints and cap with a mirrored T joint. Make the horizontal section. Make the long sides the same as with the vertical section (12 and 18\" pipe sections capped with L joints). However, join the ends closest to the center T joint with an 18\" section and the other end with 8\" sections and a T joint. You should now have two rectangles, one inside the other, and joined at their lower third point. Measure for your desired angle. The seat is formed between the short portion of the horizontal section and the long portion of the vertical section. The chair rests on the long end of the horizontal section and the short end of the vertical section. Adjust the angle that the two pieces meet at until you like the angle of the back and seat. Measure the distance between the remaining T joints on the long sides needed to create the angle you want. Cut and insert the back brace. Cut a piece of pipe to your desired length and insert it into the two T joints. Create the sling. A sling which reaches between the top part of the chair and the front edge of the seat creates the space for you to sit down. You can make this sling out of fabric or you can even make it out of something like Duct tape. All it is is a long section of fabric with tubes at either end that you fit onto the PVC pipe. You can sew these tubes into place or you can even cheat and use iron on velcro. Enjoy! Your PVC beach chair is now done. Don't forget that you can change any of the measurements to make the chair larger or smaller, or even use thinner PVC pipe. Other Options Build a bench. If none of these are quite what you're looking for, you could build any one of a number of benches found on wikiHow. Build a stool. A stool is another popular type of chair and wikiHow has instructions for many variations. You can also repair existing chairs, if you're just looking to save money. You can do things like fix a papasan chair or reupholster your existing chairs.",
