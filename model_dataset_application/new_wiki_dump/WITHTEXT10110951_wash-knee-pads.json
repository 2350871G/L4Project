Make sure the bag is closed and any snaps or Velcro on the pads are secured. If you\u2019re not sure, check the care tag inside of the pads to confirm that your pads can be machine washed. It\u2019s safe to wash most pads in the washing machine as long as they fit in the drum. If you don\u2019t have a laundry bag, you can use a spare pillowcase as a makeshift protective bag for the pads."

Instead, put a small load of T-shirts or other clothing into the washing machine until it is about halfway full. If you use them for a sport, wash your pads with your uniform or practice clothes to keep all of the components together. Avoid placing delicate laundry into the washing machine with your knee pads."

          "headline":"Add a small amount of mild laundry detergent to the washing machine.",
          "description":"Pour enough laundry detergent for a half load of laundry into the machine. This should be enough to get the pads and clothes clean without damaging the material. Make sure the detergent doesn't contain bleach, which can remove the color from some knee pads. If your pads are particularly bad smelling, you can add a capful of white vinegar to the machine to neutralize odors."

Look for these options on the panel of the washing machine, and make sure they\u2019re selected before starting the cycle. If you can\u2019t find the \u201cgentle\u201d cycle, try looking for a \u201cdelicate\u201d option on the panel."

If you can, let them dry in the sun, which helps to kill any remaining bacteria in the pads. Alternatively, you can lay them on a flat surface to dry. If you lay them out to dry, make sure to turn them over at some point to ensure that both sides of the pads dry. Avoid putting the pads in the dryer because this can cause the material to shrink or warp, making them ill-fitting."

This is a great technique for washing larger knee pads that won\u2019t fit in the washing machine, like hockey pads. Using hot water when hand washing makes the job easier on your hands because the fabric will release stains more easily. However, if you\u2019re worried about darker fabric bleeding color into the water, you can use colder water."

Once they\u2019re completely submerged, move them around the tub to mimic the movement of the washing machine. Don\u2019t be alarmed if a lot of dirt seems to come out of the pads! Sometimes, they can absorb more sweat than you realize. If the pads still smell after swirling them for 5 minutes, add an extra capful of vinegar to the water."

This lets the cleaning agents soak into the middle of the pad and prevents bacteria from growing in harder-to-clean places. For really dirty pads, you may need to drain and refill the tub with hot water after the dirt and bacteria are released. Leave the pads in the tub while you refill it, and be sure to add more detergent, vinegar, or bleach."

Squeeze the pads frequently to expel water from the foam, and remove them from the tub once the water runs clear. If it takes longer than 1-2 minutes for the water to run clear, you may need to soak the pads in laundry detergent and water for another 30 minutes to make sure they\u2019re clean.

Then, hang them up on a clothesline to dry for at least 6 hours, preferably in the sun. The sunshine will help to kill bacteria, and the pads will dry faster. If you don\u2019t have a clothesline, you can lay the pads on a flat surface in a well-ventilated area. Make sure you flip them over after about 3 hours to ensure that both sides dry evenly.
