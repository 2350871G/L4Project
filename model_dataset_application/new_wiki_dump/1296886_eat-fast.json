          "description":"If you are away from home, eating out at a fast food restaurant often seems like a quick and easy way to have a meal when you're busy. However, it takes a lot of time to decide on a restaurant, wait in line to order, then wait for your food to be cooked. If you have prepared yourself a meal ahead of time you can save yourself a lot of time."

          "description":"If you are going to eat an orange, peel it and separate the slices in advance and bring them along in a container. When you get home from the store, wash and chop up some vegetables like carrots or celery so you have them ready to go. Prepping your food ahead of time can save you valuable minutes when you don't have much time to eat. If you find you are always short on time in the mornings, prepare your breakfast the night before. Likewise, you might benefit from prepping your food at home if you struggle to find enough time to eat at work."

          "headline":"Have a small snack before your meal.",
          "description":"It takes approximately 20 minutes for your vagus nerve to stop telling your brain it is not hungry anymore. If you eat your food too quickly your brain will still think it's starving. Eating something small 30 minutes or so before your meal can help shut off those signals. This way you can eat a smaller meal, which will take you less time, and you will still feel happy and full when you finish."

          "headline":"Eat healthy portions of food.",
          "description":"Eating fast often leads to eating too much. You can avoid this by only bringing along or ordering a reasonable amount of food. If there isn't too much in front of you, then you can still have a relatively healthy lunch even if you're eating too fast. Look for pre-packaged, single-serving portions of foods like greek yogurt, crackers, and string cheese. These items are all easily transported and can help to moderate your portions."

Hard-boiled eggs can be eaten in a minute or two and are really filling and nutritious. Nuts are also a great, quick snack that will keep your belly feeling full longer than a bag of chips. Cheeses are also filling, healthy and can be eaten quickly. Fruits like apples and bananas can provide a little natural sugar kick and might satisfy your sweet tooth."

Select a protein drink that is rich in protein, carbs, and fats with sufficient calories to satisfy your needs. You may just want to use a shake to replace part of a meal. Supplement the shake with a snack of fruit or veggies to assure you get the necessary nutrients."

You don't want to choke, but you don't want to waste time chewing food unnecessarily either. As soon as you know it won't get stuck, swallow it down so you can move on to the next mouthful. If you are eating something that is bigger than you can fit in your mouth at once, like hot dogs, hamburgers or pizza, figure out the best way to break the food down with your hands to make it faster to eat. For example, you can rip your hot dogs and buns in half and dip them in water to help break down the bread and be able to fit both halves in your mouth at once."
