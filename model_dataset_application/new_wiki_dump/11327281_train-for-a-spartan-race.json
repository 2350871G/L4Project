The Sprint is a course that covers 3 miles (4.8 km) and includes 20 obstacles, but has been updated to include new challenges. The Super course is  8 miles (13 km) long and contains 25 obstacles. The Beast is 13 miles (21 km) long with 30 obstacles\nThe Ultra, thought of as the hardest Spartan Race, is 30 miles (48 km) long and contains 60 intense obstacles."

The benefits of daily cardio include improved oxygen circulation, more efficient muscle development, and a stronger heart\u2014all of which will help you as you train for and complete the Spartan Race. To calculate your target heart rate, you first need to find your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age from 220.

That is one rep. You should aim to do 3 reps during a workout. Push-ups primarily strengthen the chest, arms (triceps and deltoids), and some of the back and abs. If classic push-ups become easy or boring, add some variety to your push-ups. Put your feet on a chair while doing them, or bring you arms right up next to your chest, or try to push off the ground and do a clap between push-ups."

To build these muscles, use weights or heavy objects that are between 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and 20 pounds (9.1 kg) to perform different curls or lifts: bicep curls, overhead tricep extensions, lateral raises, and chest raises from a prone position. As with the other exercises, perform each exercise 10 to 12 times as one rep, and aim for 3 reps in a workout."

Make squats more interesting by trying out different variations, like adding weights, putting your legs further apart or closer together, or adding jumps. Experiment with different types of lunges, too.
