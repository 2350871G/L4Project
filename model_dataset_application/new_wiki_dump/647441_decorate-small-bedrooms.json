          "description":"Dark hues have an amazing capacity to make a small room feel like a tiny cave. Instead, stick with cheery colors like sky blue, sunshine yellow, cream, aloe green, etc. (These are not real paint colors, or if they are it is coincidence that they are listed here--these were simply written as examples). If light colors really aren\u2019t your thing and you really want something darker, go with vibrant, bright colors like burnt orange, cherry red, or bright turquoise. These colors will make a bold statement without making the walls seem like they are closing in on a guest. Another option is to paint one wall in the room dark, such as the wall behind the headboard of your bed. This will anchor the bed without making the room seem smaller. This is called a feature wall. If you don't have the room for a proper headboard, you could even paint a faux one using darker paint. Another option is to have your feature wall on the wall with your largest window; having a dark color on the wall surrounding your window will draw the eye towards the window itself. Expert Answer\t\t\t\t\t\tQ\t\t\t\tA wikiHow reader asked: \"How do you make a small bedroom look bigger?\" Katherine Tlapa\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInterior Designer\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKatherine Tlapa is an interior designer, currently working as a Design Specialist for Modsy, a design service based in San Francisco.

EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tKatherine Tlapa, an interior designer, answers: \"The best way to make a room feel bigger is to brighten it up. Make sure you have sufficient lighting - add lamps to your nightstands or string lights on your headboard if you need more. Paint the walls a light shade, and make sure you're letting in as much natural light as you can.\""

          "headline":"Invest in a lot of mirrors.",
          "description":"Mirrors are an excellent way to make a room seem larger. If you already have a closet with a full-length mirror for a door, excellent! Do not replace it for anything. If you don\u2019t have a mirror already installed,  consider using mirrors as decorations. Make cool arrangements with odd shaped mirrors on your walls, or hang a large mirror somewhere. These additions really will help make your room feel like it has become larger. Be careful not to go overboard with mirrors! Too many may make you feel like you are living in a funhouse. To brighten a room, place the mirror opposite a window. This will not only lighten the room, but also create the illusion that you have multiple windows."

        {
          "headline":"Work with what you have.",
          "description":"If your tiny bedroom has features like a fireplace, or an odd nook, use it to your advantage. Use the top of the fireplace like a bookshelf. Or, if it is a taller fireplace that has been sealed off, place your bed up against it, letting the moulding of the fireplace act as a headboard. Nooks and crannies can be filled with chairs, a desk, or even a small built-in and cushioned bench for reading, particularly in front of windows. If the ceilings are high, use all of the height, such as by placing a tall bookshelf in the room and placing seldom used items at the top of it."

          "description":"As custom cubby design that incorporates your bed can go a long way in a small room. Imagine it as an extended headboard that doubles as a bunch of cupboards. Of course, it\u2019s important to remember to build around your bed--leave enough room so that you can sit up in your bed against the wall without hitting your head on a shelf or cubby."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Don\u2019t clutter your walls with decorations.",
          "description":"Because your room is small, you will want to make it feel as open as possible. When too many decorations are hung on the walls, it can have a similar effect to painting your walls a very dark color--the room suddenly feels like a cave. Instead, go with a few wall decorations (like mirrors) and leave other decorations for the surface spaces. Try placing a few pictures or a single piece of statement art on the wall."

Because you don\u2019t want these two items warring with one another for attention, its best to choose one as the focus of the room. Whichever you select, dress the other focus point neutrally. For instance, if you choose to focus on the bed, play the headboard space up with a few bright throw pillows and a fun duvet cover. At the same time, use neutral colors like white, cream, grey, or tan for curtains on your window. You can also create a win-win situation by placing your bed under your window--the two will combine into one pretty focus point."

Fulls and doubles are generally the way to go in a small space. However, if you are decorating a kid\u2019s small bedroom, definitely stick with a twin bed--they take up the least amount of space. If you will only be sleeping in the room and there\u2019s not much else in there, then you can use a large bed."

Purchase a closet shelf, which can be bought at a home furnishing store, and install it upside down on your wall. This will provide you with a place to store things, put an alarm clock, or add some decorative touches to your bedside area. You can also  install regular shelves that will work the same way as the closet shelf, but won\u2019t have the blocked ends to keep things from falling off. Try putting the bed up against the wall on one side of the room and the nightstand on one side of the bed. Opting for a nightstand that has some storage space for clothing is another great way to maximize your space."

Make a point of  keeping your area tidy by  making your bed everyday, putting things away after you have used them, and hanging up clothes at night. It is also a good idea to have a laundry basket or bag somewhere in your room--like your closet. Reducing the amount of clutter will increase your surface area in the room, and this will make it seem larger."

In particularly, hanging lights, like a funky chandelier, can really spruce up a room. Because they are hanging from above or off the wall, they also take up less space than a standard desk lamp does."
