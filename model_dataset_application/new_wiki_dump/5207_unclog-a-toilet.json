Instead, take the lid off of the toilet tank and close the toilet flapper. Closing the flapper will keep more water from entering the bowl. The flapper looks like a circular drain stopper attached to a chain. The water in the tank isn't dirty, so it's fine to stick your hand inside to close the flapper."

          "description":"In case splashing occurs, place newspapers or paper towels on the floor to soak up liquid. The paper will make for easier cleanup later. You should also turn on the ventilation fan or open a window to rid the area of foul odors. If the clog is serious, put on a pair of rubber gloves. Toilets are unsanitary, but a good pair of rubber cleaning gloves will protect you from any germs within. Choose gloves that reach up to your elbows. You may also want to put on an old set of clothing, just in case things get messy."

          "description":"It is important to use a large heavy-duty rubber plunger, either the ball-shaped type or one with a fold-out rubber flange on the bottom which forms a seal. Do not use the small cheap suction-cup type of plunger. These will often not work. Run the plunger under hot water before using it. This will soften it up, which will help with create a seal."

It is important to be pushing and pulling water through the opening, not air. Add water from the sink to the bowl if necessary. Pump the plunger over the hole. Start slowly at first, since the first plunge will push air into the bowl. Push down, then pull up sharply to disturb the clog and loosen it. Continue vigorously pushing and pulling until the water begins to drain. It may take 15 to 20 cycles before the toilet unclogs. Be patient. As long as you're sure there's no hard object, plunging alone often suffices. It might not work immediately but will often work after a few repeated efforts and flushings, with each effort consisting of dozens of plunge cycles."

Fill it to the point it is normally after a regular flush, then plunge again. Stubborn clogs might require you to do this a number of times."
