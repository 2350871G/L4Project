Cover the nuts with approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) of tap water. Use raw nuts if you can. These will last longer and make a fresher tasting milk. Almonds, cashews, and peanuts are popular and delicious choices. Use 1 type of nuts or try combining different types of nut to create a unique tasting milk."

Leave the nuts to soak overnight out on the kitchen counter at room temperature or for up to 2 days in the fridge. Larger nuts will require more soaking time than smaller nuts. Peanuts can absorb water in just 6 hours, whereas, large cashews need at least 12 hours. If you are using a variety of nuts, don\u2019t worry about the different times as you can\u2019t over-soak the nuts."
