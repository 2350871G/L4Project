At year's end, hot-house poinsettias provide dynamic color in a colorless season. These flowers come in many shades from bright red, to red-orange, pink, white and mixtures of those hues. Set off by green leaves surrounding the blossoms makes for instant excitement. At times of the year other than the dead of winter, you might want to highlight a different flower. Just pick something with bright colors and large enough blossoms to blend into a line of color as seen through the glass."

          "description":"Start with the flowers. Merge them into a band of color, forgoing details at this time, and with a smaller, pointed brush add the green leaves surrounding them. As soon as the painted band of flowers loses its shine, carefully apply salt. Leave it alone for the salt to do its work. It will form interesting star-shaped areas as the salt attracts the pigment. (If you wait too long, it won't work, but don't mess with it, just try again on another painting or piece of paper to get the timing right.) Paint the color in the greenhouse beyond and above the flowers. Any dark color will do. Again, work fast. Skip over the braces or framing around the windows. Allow to dry. Paint a neutral color such as tan or gray for the structural greenhouse frame. Allow the painting to dry naturally, or you can use a hairdryer to hasten the process."

          "description":"If you are doing a winter scene, adding falling snow is a lot of fun. On a separate palette or a large plastic lid, squeeze out some white paint. Dilute it with water carefully and slowly until it resembles heavy cream. Mix the white paint thoroughly. Dip your spattering brush into the paint and on a practice piece of paper, try making spatters. A toothbrush will give small spatters, while a bristle brush will make bigger spatters. Simply hold the bristles down toward the scrap paper and run your thumb over it, aiming downward. Again, dry the entire thing. Overnight is good because it takes the paper a lot of time to get truly dry. Ideally, the colors will lie on the surface and jump out at you."
