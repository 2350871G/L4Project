  "text":" Making the Cookie Dough Sift the flour into the mixing bowl.  Cut the butter into small pieces. Rub the pieces into the flour. Add the sugar and stir through.  Add cocoa until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.  Tip in the milk. Stir with the fork. Mix until it forms a dough. Use your hands to roll into a ball of dough. Wrap the dough in plastic food wrap. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 20 minutes. Baking the Cookies Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC/350\u00baF. Line the baking sheets with parchment paper in readiness for use. Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator. Roll out on a surface sprinkled with flour, to prevent sticking. Roll the dough to a thickness about 5mm/ \u20444 inch (0.6 cm). Cut out circles in the dough. Either use a circle cookie cutter or the open end of an average-sized glass. Leftover dough can be rolled into a ball and re-rolled to cut more cookies from. Arrange the cut cookies on the baking sheets.  Place in the oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven when baked. Let sit for 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then remove and allow to cool on a wire cooling rack before icing. Adding the Cobweb Designs Begin in the middle of each cookie. Draw a spiral design with the white writing icing. Continue piping the spiral. Pipe the icing evenly from the center right out to the edge of the cookie. Use the toothpick to add the web effects. Starting at the center, drag the toothpick to the outer edge. Aim to do this about 6-8 times around the whole cookie, dividing it into equal pie slice shapes. Make any other adjustments using the toothpick that you think will enhance the look of the web. Consider making small spiders for a more realistic look and a touch to the cookies. Repeat with the remaining cookies. When finished, you'll have a batch of cobweb cookies that look tasty and intricately detailed. Serve. Ways to serve include:\nSimply pile into a basket, web side facing upward. Pierce little holes in the cookies and string them up on a thin piece of twine to make cobweb cookie bunting. Hang in place. Use the cookies as part of a decorative food setting, perhaps including edible spider candies, edible insect candies, etc.",
