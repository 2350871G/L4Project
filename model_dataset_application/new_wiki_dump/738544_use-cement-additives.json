  "text":" Steps Take precautions before you start. Most cement additives are non-flammable and non-hazardous in normal use but sensible precautions should be taken when using them in much the same way as when using cement which is an alkaline product. Avoid skin contact as much as possible. If contact does occur or if liquid is accidentally splashed in the eyes wash out thoroughly in clean water. You should wash anyway after using cement and additives, before eating or allowing hand to mouth contact. Should any liquid be swallowed, seek medical advice immediately Store properly. All additives should be stored in a frost free place within the temperature range 5\u00b0 - 30\u00b0 C. Liquid waterproofer Pun or vibrate the concrete. To achieve the greatest resistance, it is essential that concrete is well punned or vibrated to eliminate trapped air. Understand the effect of the additive. It is to 'plasticise' the mix, reducing the amount of gauging water required, giving the mix additional strength and flexibility to prevent it cracking or crazing during a more controlled drying out period. It provides a compact easily worked mix when wet with a smoother hard wearing, less dusty surface when dry.

It is simply mixed with water 1:30 and added to the cement/aggregate mix as the gauging water to the required consistency. Mortar plasticiser Use a mortar plasticizer. It has all the advantages of lime and none of the disadvantages. This liquid admixture plasticises a cement/sand mix using less gauging water than usual, giving an easily workable 'fatty' mortar with strong adhesion. It has a reasonably fast initial setting period but leaves ample time for the adjustment of bricks. When dry the mortar with added plasticiser is more resistant to the effects of frost than a standard cement/sand/lime mix. Add the plasticiser to the gauging water at a rate of \u20445 liter (0.1 US gal) of plasticiser to 20 liters (5.3 US gal) of water. It is normal practice to mix sufficient plasticiser and water in a large tub to provide a uniform strength for several mixes of cement and sand. As a rough guide, you will need to mix in 0.28 liters (0.1 US gal) of plasticiser with water for every 50Kg of cement. Concrete Dust Proofer and Surface Hardener Add a concrete dustproofer and surface hardener. It is a ready-to-use alkaline solution of tough silicate material which combines with softer lime-free particles in conventional concrete mixes to form a harder surface which resists wear and dusting. It can be used on old concrete in basically good condition or on new concrete laid at least 14 days before. Pour the dust-proofer in the concrete. Provided the concrete is clean and free from surface water, the dust-proofer is simply poured onto the floor and spread out with a soft broom, then left to dry for 40 minutes. The floor is then washed with clean water. Add more if needed. On very porous floors a second or third coat should be applied with 40-60 minutes between coats. Ponding should be removed after 10 minutes. 40-60 minutes after the final coat the floor should be washed with clean water. When coloured pigments have been used on concrete or granolithic flooring, it is advisable to test treat a small area first to check that Dustproofer has no adverse effects on the colour. Frost proofer and rapid hardener Place sheeting down for summer laying. In very hot weather where concrete has been laid in direct sunlight, polythene sheeting or damp sacking should still be placed over the surface to prevent the top drying out at a faster rate than the remainder. Take precautions with winter laying. In winter, the concrete will still harden much more quickly than usual and is protected against sudden temperature drops but you should still take the precautions generally associated with cold weather concreting, such as laying polythene sheeting covered with sacks, expanded polystyrene or a similar insulant over the concrete to preserve the heat generated during the drying process. Use with the correct cement. Frost Proofer and Rapid Hardener should only be used with ordinary and rapid hardening Portland Cement. It should not be used with high alumina cements, sulphate resistant cements, extra rapid hardening Portland Cement, lime mortars or in mixes intended for steam curing. The admixture which contains calcium chloride should also not be used in steel reinforced concrete or for pre-stressed concrete work. The admixture is added to gauging water at the rate of 1.7 liters (0.4 US gal) for each 50 Kg of cement. In winter, the gauging water should be at temperature of not less than 20\u00b0C particularly when the air temperature is close to zero. When mixed and laid the concrete should be no colder than 10 \u00b0C. At no time should the component parts of the mix be allowed to become frozen. Wickes waterproofer and retarder for render - 5 liters (1.3 US gal) - 240-146 Use internally or externally. Generally used for exterior rendering, it can also be used internally for making good after the installation of injected damp proof courses. Add the admixture to the gauging water at a ratio of 1 part admixture to 30 parts water.  Calculate at 500\u20131,000 milliliters (16.9\u201333.8  fl oz) per 50kg of cement. ",
