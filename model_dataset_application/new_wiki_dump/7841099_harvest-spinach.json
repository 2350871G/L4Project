If you want the spinach to regrow again, chop it at the base whilst leaving a bit of stem for it to regrow. If you're lucky, you will have another batch of spinach to harvest. Additionally, you can cut the bigger, outer leaves and leave the smaller spinach leaves to grow. This way you'll have yourself another harvest if the rest of the spinach leaves still need time to grow."

      "description":"The most common problems gardeners encounter is when the spinach leaves turn yellow or \"bolt\". Be sure to harvest the spinach before then. Bolting is when the stems and leaves shoot straight up, failing to form the larger leaves required for culinary purposes. It usually occurs when the climate gets warmer early in the growing season. The spinach prepares to 'flower' and reproduce rather than focusing on leaf production."
