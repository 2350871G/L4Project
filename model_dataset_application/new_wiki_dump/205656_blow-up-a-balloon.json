Stretching the balloon will loosen the latex, making the inflation process less resistant. Stretch the balloon in all directions, being careful not to tear the latex. Just make sure not to stretch the balloon too much, or you risk it popping when you inflate it. A few stretches here and there will get the job done."

Try to keep your lips puckered and tight as you blow into the balloon. Your cheeks will fill with some air, but they shouldn't be getting really big \u2014 the balloon should! Think of how a trumpeter blows into his or her horn: Maintain good embouchure, or facial muscle tension, especially if your lungs are weak or you're having trouble getting the balloon to fill with air.

But it will gradually expand after the initial resistance. This takes some getting used to, so keep blowing until the balloon inflates, then use that experience to guide you for the next balloon. If you're still having trouble blowing up the balloon after the first attempt, try tugging on the spout of the balloon gently as you blow into it for the second time.

Blowing Up a Balloon With a Manual Pump Attach the opening of the balloon to the nozzle of the pump. The nozzle should be ribbed to allow for a tight hold on the opening of the balloon. Start pumping. For a hand pump, pull out the hand lever and then press it back in. For a foot pump, step on the pedal and release it. There\u2019s no need to stretch out the balloon latex first. Tie the balloon when it\u2019s filled. Once again, use wikiHow\u2019s handy guide! Using a Helium Tank Screw the inflator onto the helium tank. The inflator is a metal tube that is threaded at one end and has a nozzle on the other end. Screw it securely onto the threaded opening at the top of the tank. Press the correct adaptor onto the end of the inflator. Most inflators come with two attached, plastic, cone-shaped adaptors. The smaller one is for foil balloons; the larger, for latex balloons. Securely press the adaptor that suits your needs onto the inflator. Open the valve.

Creating a Science Experiment Add two tablespoons of baking soda to a deflated latex balloon. Insert the small end of a funnel into the mouth of the balloon to make this process much easier. Two tablespoons equals roughly 30 grams (1 oz). Pour four ounces of vinegar into a small soda bottle. Use a clean, dry, empty bottle. Once again, a funnel will make this easier (but rinse away any baking soda residue first). Four ounces equals roughly 120 milliliters (4  fl oz). Place the balloon\u2019s mouth over the bottle top.

Let the baking soda fall into the bottle. Lift the limp balloon over the top of the bottle and pull upward slightly, so that the baking soda can fall straight down into the bottle.
