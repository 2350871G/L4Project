      "description":"The Peace Lily is a green leafy plant that produces an elegant and unique looking white flower; it is a house plant that likes sitting near a window, getting some indirect sunlight (not too much, in other words). Add some sand to the top of the soil of your Peace Lily to keep the soil drained and give it a nicer look. It is best to keep your Peace Lily indoors. However, it can survive outdoors if planted under a tree and kept watered and shaded. It needs to be watered about every other day...just enough to keep the soil moist, but not soggy. To start a new plant, be sure to pull roots and all up, when ready to transplant a piece."

Water every couple of days, just enough to keep the soil moist. To start a new plant, simply break a clipping from the original at the joints. The clipping can be placed in water to allow the roots to grow or be transplanted right away."

Succulents all prefer the soil to be on the dry side; do not soak them. They are great if kept indoors or outdoors, but if keeping inside, set them where they can get some sunlight and they'll be happy plants."
