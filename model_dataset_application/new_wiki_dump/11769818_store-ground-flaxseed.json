Examples of airtight containers include plastic containers with sealable lids, glass jars with lids that can be sealed closed, and plastic freezer bags with sealable openings.

Check the expiration date on the packaging to select the freshest flaxseed. If you\u2019re looking for ground flaxseed that will store the longest, choose a vacuum-sealed container or bag. Expiration Tips\nYou can extend the life of your ground flaxseed past its expiration date if the package is unopened. Store unopened containers or packages in your fridge for 1-2 months past the written expiration date. You can also put the unopened container in your freezer to extend the life of the ground flaxseed for 3-4 months."
