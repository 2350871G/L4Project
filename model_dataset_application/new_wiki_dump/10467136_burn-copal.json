Burning Copal without Charcoal Try a resin burner for ease of use. Put a small amount of copal into the cup of the resin burner. Next, find a socket for the plug and connect it to an electrical outlet. If the burner has a temperature setting, turn it to 235 \u00b0F (113 \u00b0C), and place the lid on top.

Turn the stove burner on to medium-high, and then set a piece of resin on the foil. Make sure to keep an eye on it the whole time it's burning. If the copal is burning too hot for your liking, turn the burner down. Use a pan to burn the copal on your stove for another quick solution. Pick a small pan that you don't mind dedicating to resin burning, though you can line it with foil if you'd like. Turn the stove burner to medium-high, and put the pan on top. Set a small amount of copal resin in the pan, and let it start burning. Leave it on until the copal burns out. You can always add more copal as needed. Don't use a pan that has a nonstick coating, as those can put off chemicals if you don't have much in them. Use an oil warmer for less smoke.

Just leave it in the warmer to cool, then turn the warmer back on when you want to heat it up again. Place a copal resin incense stick in a holder or sand. Sometimes, copal is formed around a stick. In that case, light the bigger end. Set the smaller end in a bowl filled with sand or in an incense holder built for stick incense. Don't leave stick incense unattended. Enjoying the Benefits of Burning Copal Use copal before meditation to provide peace of mind. Many people burn copal before they meditate or while meditating. They believe that it assists with removing negative energy from your mind, body, and space. Smudge a space with copal smoke to clear bad energy.
