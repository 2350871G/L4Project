But there are plenty of other types of lamps that contain more of the toxic chemical, including neon and black lights, fluorescents, tanning bed lamps, sodium and mercury vapor lamps, metal halide and mercury short-arc lamps. You should know which type of lamp you have so you can follow the safest procedures for disposing of it. A printed label typically appears above a CFL\u2019s screw base.

          "headline":"Remove the lamps from their fixtures once they\u2019re cool.",
          "description":"Once a lamp has burned out, you should wait until it has completely cooled before attempting to remove it from its fixture. Then, unplug it (or make sure the switch is off if you\u2019re not able to unplug it). Most household CFLs can be twisted out of their sockets, whereas fluorescent tubes can usually be rotated 90 degrees from both ends until they slide out of their sockets. Look up the manual for the fixture you have and follow the removal instructions. Consider using a ladder to safely reach the fixture, and laying down a drop cloth in case of breakage. Arc lamps reach extremely high temperatures. You\u2019ll risk burns and potentially ignite any surface you place one of these hot lamps upon. Wait until the lamp is cool (at least 15 minutes) before extracting it. Neon lights can be incredibly dangerous, so don\u2019t try to remove neon tubes from their fixtures. Enlist the help of a professional if necessary."

          "description":"Search for detailed cleanup procedures specific to your situation and safely follow all guidelines when cleaning up the mercury and glass shards. Use a piece of cardboard to sweep the debris into a container. Pick up mercury powder and small fragments using the adhesive side of a piece of tape and add this to the disposal container. Seal it up and search specifically for a waste facility that accepts broken lamps containing mercury. Either a lidded plastic tub, a lidded glass container, or a resealable plastic bag is safe to use. Do not attempt to vacuum up the mess! Vacuum cleaning can spread toxic mercury material. Unbroken lamps are often good candidates for recycling programs, whereas broken lamps cannot be recycled."

In many areas, they cannot be thrown in the trash and left for regular curbside pickup. Check with your local authorities to see what disposal methods are permitted and prohibited in your area. Numerous U.S. states have banned the inclusion of light bulbs containing mercury in regular trash and landfills. Some municipalities do offer curbside pickup programs or semiannual HHM collections. If your location doesn\u2019t require recycling and permits the inclusion of CFLs in the regular trash, you should completely seal the lamps in individual plastic bags and keep them outside in a protected space until the trash is collected."
