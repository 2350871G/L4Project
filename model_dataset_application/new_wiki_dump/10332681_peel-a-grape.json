  "text":" Peeling with a Knife Wash your grapes. Before peeling your grapes, rinse them in cold water from the sink. Hold the grape bunch by the stem, and let the water run over them. Try to cover every grape with water. Make sure there is no residue from the package remaining on any grape, and that their surfaces are all clean and clear. Remove the grape stems. Take each grape off its stem before you begin peeling it. Either twist or pull it out of the grape to remove it. Toss any grapes with broken skins you come across.

Fill a medium sized cooking pot you can fit a grape bunch into with water, and set on the stove to boil. Continue to let it boil once it reaches the right temperature. Prepare a bucket of ice water.
