Place in large pot and set aside. In the same saucepan, brown ground beef and sausage (can be done together or separately). When done cooking, drain grease and add to the onions in the large pot. Add pasta sauce and tomato paste to the meat and onions in the large pot. Allow to simmer on low to medium heat, stirring occasionally, until needed later. REMEMBER THE PASTA. When it's done cooking, drain it and return to pot. Preheat oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and grease the pie plates.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, eggs and parmesan cheese.

Using the remaining cheese mixture, create a layer on top of the sauce. Arrange the mozzarella slices on top of cheese mixture.
