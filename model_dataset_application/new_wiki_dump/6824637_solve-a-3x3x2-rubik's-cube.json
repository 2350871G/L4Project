  "text":" Understanding the Notation Become familiar with the notation used here. Each letter refers to a 90-degree clockwise movement of a face. Holding the cube directly in front of you, these rules apply:\nIf the letter is F, turn the layer facing you clockwise. If the letter is B, turn the layer opposite the layer facing you clockwise.

If the letter is L, turn the layer on your left clockwise. If the letter is R, turn the layer on your right clockwise. Know that a tick mark represents a counterclockwise movement. For example, F' (read F prime) represents a 90-degree counterclockwise movement of the layer facing you. Know that a 2 represents a 180-degree movement. For example, U2 represents a 180-degree movement of the layer furthest from the floor. Know that a number before an algorithm in parentheses means repeat the algorithm that many times. E.g., 2(R2 U2 F2) is executed the same as R2 U2 F2 R2 U2 F2. Building the Bottom Layer Make the cross.
