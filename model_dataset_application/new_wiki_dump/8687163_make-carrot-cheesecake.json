Puree the mixture for a minute until it is fully combined. Make sure to stop the food processor and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula before processing it again to ensure that all of the cream cheese is incorporated. Beat in the eggs one a a time. Once you've mixed the cream cheese into the filling, add 4 eggs to the food processor. However, add the eggs one at a time, processing each addition before adding the next. You can use egg substitute in place of the eggs if you prefer. Baking the Cheesecake Pour the cheesecake batter into the crust and top with nuts. After you've beaten the eggs into the cheesecake filling, carefully spread it over the prepared crust. Next, sprinkle the top of the cake with \u00bc cup (30 g) of chopped pecans. If you prefer, you can substitute another nut for the pecans, such as walnuts. Bake the cake until it is set. Once the cake is prepared, place it in the preheated oven. Allow it to bake for 50 to 60 minutes or until the center of the cake is just set. You can be sure that the cheesecake is finished baking by inserting a toothpick, knife, or cake tester into the center. If it comes out clean, the cheesecake is ready. Allow the cake to cool. When the cake is finished baking, remove the pan from the oven. Let the cake cool on wire for 10 minutes. Run a knife along the edges of the cake to help loosen it, and allow it cool for another hour. The cake is fairly fragile, so be careful when you're running the knife around the edges. Cover the cake and refrigerate before serving. Once the cake is cool, cover the pan loosely with a piece of plastic wrap.
