It\u2019s okay to take more than 1 cutting from the plant, as long as you don\u2019t cut away more than one-third of the plant. Taking more cuttings from your jasmine increases your chances of successfully growing a new plant."

However, the cutting is more likely to root if the top few leaves are left on the stem. Leave a few leaves at the top of the cutting while removing most of the leaves from the bottom. You can cut the leaves off the stem or pluck them with your fingers. Removing most of the leaves helps to balance the growth between roots and leaves."

Additionally, dying flowers will mold, damaging the rest of the cutting. You can cut the flowers off or pinch them off. Don\u2019t take cuttings from stems that are in bloom. Even if a flower is cut off, it will still be in the bloom stage."
