          "description":"Mix together a paste of 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of water and 2 tablespoons (6 g) of baking soda. The paste should be a bit runny, but still thick enough so that it can stick to the plate of your iron. Use filtered or distilled water, if you can."

If your iron is only dirty in one place, you don\u2019t have to spread the mixture all over. If you are just doing a general cleaning, it is also OK to spread the paste over the entire plate. You can use your fingers to apply the paste or you can use a spatula. You can leave this paste sitting on the iron for a few minutes if there is a lot of buildup on the iron. Spread the paste on generously, especially if your iron is very dirty."

You may need to use more than one cotton swab if there is a lot of gunk coming out of the holes. Use a new cotton swab if there is a lot of buildup stuck on the swab."

After it is empty, use distilled or filtered water, and fill the reservoir about 1/3 of the way. You can also fill the reservoir with a mixture of 3/4 cup (180 mL) of water and 1/4 cup (60 mL) of white vinegar for a stronger cleaning solution. However, you should read your iron\u2019s instruction manual to make sure that it will tolerate vinegar."

Don\u2019t get burned by the steam that will be released by the iron."

All you need to do now is iron the cloth to help clean out the iron. If you have a manual steam button, press the button often to help release even more steam.

You can also use a soft brush to do this, unless you have a teflon coated iron as the brush may scratch the coating. Avoid using a wire brush as this will ruin the iron\u2019s plate.

You can do this by dipping a clean rag into some white vinegar and gently cleaning the plate of the iron again. After that, you can turn the iron on and run it over a piece of old, but clean cloth. This will help burn off any residue that might be left."
