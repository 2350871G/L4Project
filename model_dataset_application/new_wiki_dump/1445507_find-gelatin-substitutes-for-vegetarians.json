          "description":"Heat up powdered agar agar in boiling water to dissolve and activate it. Make sure to stir it constantly so it doesn\u2019t clump up! Use the same amount of powdered agar agar that you would use for gelatin powder. For instance, if the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) of gelatin, use 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) of agar agar. Agar agar is made of cooked and pressed algae, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s totally flavorless! Agar agar, also called kanten, is a traditional substitute for gelatin in many recipes (particularly Asian desserts). 2 tbsp (28.6 g) of powder or 1 tbsp (14.3 g) of flakes mixed with 16 fluid ounces (470 mL) of liquid will produce a firm jelly. Powdered agar agar is the strongest while the flakes and the bar forms are less potent. 1 tsp (4.2 g) of agar agar powder = 1 tbsp (14.3 g) of flakes = \u00bd agar bar."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Thicken soft jellies, puddings, soups, and vegan ice creams with carrageenan.",
          "description":"Soak dried whole carrageenan (in seaweed form) in water for about 12 hours before you plan to use it. When you notice it swelling, remove it from the water and boil it in the liquid that you plan to use in your recipe. Once it\u2019s thoroughly boiled for 10 minutes, strain it out using a fine mesh sieve. One oz (28 g) of dried carrageenan will set 1 cup (240 mL) of liquid. Use kappa carrageenan for firm gels and iota carrageenan to create elastic-like gels. You can also blend the two types together or a not-too-firm, not-too-soft consistency. Lambda carrageenan is best used as a thickener for syrups, sauces, and gravies. Add it to vegan coconut milk ice cream to make it thick and decadent! Note that carrageenan has been linked to mild gastrointestinal problems and other health issues like inflammation, gut tumors, and ulcers. However, these symptoms have only been reported with extremely high doses."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Make thick homemade jams, jellies, and marmalades with pectin.",
          "description":"Pectin requires sugar and some sort of acid to properly activate, so it\u2019s perfect when you\u2019re working with fruit that contains natural sugars and acidity. For example, for a loose-set strawberry jam, use 6 cups (2040 g) of strawberries and 4 tbsp (56 g) of no-sugar-needed pectin or 7 tbsp (89 g) of regular pectin. Low-sugar methoxyl pectin works great for hard-set jellies and jams. Increase the amount of pectin powder by 3 for medium and firm-set jellies and jams. For example, if you\u2019re working with 6 cups (2040 g) of strawberries, use 7 tbsp (89 g) of no-sugar-needed pectin or 10 tbsp (127 g) of regular pectin for a medium-set jelly. To thicken a soup that already contains sugar (like a sweet coconut milk and yam soup), use about 1/8 tsp (0.6 g) of powdered pectin for every 1 cup (240 mL) of liquid. Boil the mixture for 30 seconds to activate it. Pectin can also be a great substitution for eggs in vegan baking. Extract pectin from the cores and skins of sliced green apples. Boil them for 20 to 30 minutes, strain out the pectin through a sieve layered with cheesecloths, and reduce the liquid to half. Store it in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 2 or 3 months."

          "description":"Kuzu powder comes in chunks, so use the back of a spoon to crush the chunks before you measure out the correct amount. Use about 1 1/2 tbsp (19 g) of kuzu for every 1 cup (240 mL) of liquid. If you want to gel a liquid, add 2 tbsp (28.6 g) per cup. To turn a liquid into a gel (like for turning fruit reductions into cake ornaments), use 2 tbsp (25.5 g) of kuzu powder for every 1 cup (240 mL) of liquid. Kuzu is not the same thing as arrowroot, potato starch, and cornstarch. Kuzu will gives soups a shiny gloss and is great for thickening sauces and gravies without affecting the taste. Dust vegetables and vegetarian meats (like tofu, tempeh, or seitan) in kuzu powder and deep-fry it for a light, crispy coating for vegan tempura and fried chick\u2019n!"

        {
          "headline":"Blend xanthan gum into vegan dressings, ice cream, yogurt, or sour cream.",
          "description":"Use a blender to incorporate xanthan into your recipes because it will seize up and cause clumps if it\u2019s not constantly in motion. Use half the amount of xanthan gum that the recipe suggests for the gelatin. For example, if the recipe requires 2 tsp (8.5 g) of gelatin, only 1 tsp (4.25 g) of xanthan gum. Use 1/8 tsp (0.6 g) of xanthan gum for every 1 cup (240 mL) of liquid. Avoid xanthan gum if you\u2019re allergic to corn. Xanthan gum is especially great for homemade vegan yogurt because it will act as a thickener and a stabilizing agent, preventing ingredients from separating."
