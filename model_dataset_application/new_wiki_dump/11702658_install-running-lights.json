          "description":"Universal-mount DRL kits use 2 LED light bars that clip into separate mounting brackets. Hold a bracket (without the light bar installed) against the vehicle body where you want it placed, stick a pencil through the pre-drilled screw holes to mark the locations, and repeat with the other bracket. Your DRL will look better if you take the time to use a tape measure and pencil to mark off a pair of symmetrical locations (typically beneath and slightly in from the headlights) for the brackets. Government vehicle safety regulations where you live may require that DRLs be a certain height off the ground, a certain distance from the outer edges of the car, and/or at a certain angle vis-a-vis the front headlights. The instructions provided in this article are generally applicable, but most specifically related to one of the most popular DRL kits\u2014the Philips LED Daylight 8 kit. Always follow your specific product\u2019s instructions when installing running lights."

          "description":"Line up the screw holes in one of the brackets over the pencil marks you made, then use an electric screwdriver to drive the 2 provided screws through the holes and into the body material of the vehicle. Do the same with the other bracket. Alternatively, use a power drill to create holes in the auto body at the pencil marks, then place the bracket over the holes and drive the screws in place with a manual screwdriver. Another option is to skip using the mounting bracket altogether and instead secure the light bar itself directly to the auto body using outdoor-rated, heavy-duty, double-sided tape. This might be an option if you\u2019re putting the lights beneath the overhang of an air intake grille, for instance."

This is the \u201cnerve center\u201d of the kit and should be placed near the vehicle\u2019s battery. Use screws, zip ties, or mounting tape (one or more of which should be provided in the kit) to stick the box near the battery, but away from heat sources within the engine compartment. For instance, look for a spot along the perimeter of the engine bay that\u2019s within about 1 ft (30 cm) of the vehicle battery."

Work the wire up and out of the top front of the engine bay for the time being, then repeat the process with the other light bar\u2019s wire. In some cases, you may need to remove and then reinstall the vehicle\u2019s front grille in order to get the wires into the engine bay.

Some brands may not have the 2-pronged forks at the ends of the wires. Refer to your product guide for specific instructions. Connecting to the Side or Marker Lights Identify the positive wire for the battery-side marker or side light. Side lights are usually located to the inside of the headlights, while marker lights are typically to the outside.
