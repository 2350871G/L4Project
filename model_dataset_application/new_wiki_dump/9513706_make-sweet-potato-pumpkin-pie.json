  "text":" Making the Pie Crust Gather all of the pie crust ingredients listed above. Also, gather the items listed in things you'll need. Take the stick of butter (1/2 cup) out of the packaging and place it on a plate.  Cut butter into cubes and put it in the freezer for 5 minutes.  Prepare ice water. Measure out 1/4 cup of water in measuring cup. Place measuring cup in the freezer for about 15 minutes or until ice crystals begin to form. Measure out 1 1/4 cups of flour and 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  Combine in a bowl using a whisk or a fork.  Remove the butter from the freezer and add to the flour/salt mixture.  Cut in butter. Using a fork, cut the butter up by pushing the bottom of the fork into the butter continuously. Do this until coarse crumbs form and the butter is evenly distributed with the flour/salt mixture (about 7 minutes). Put mixture in the freezer. Leave for approximately 5 minutes. Take the ice water, and the mixture, out of the freezer.  Gradually, using a spoon, pour the ice water into the butter/flour/salt mixture. Combine with a fork until it begins to clump up and form a ball. Wash hands if you haven't already, and form the dough into a ball.  Lay out a sheet of plastic wrap and place the ball of dough on top. Cover the ball in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least 4 hours. Making the Pie Filling and Baking Gather all of the pie filling ingredients listed above as well as the items listed in things you'll need.  Bring water to a boil in large pot. Add two medium sweet potatoes to boiling water. Boil in whole skin for 40-50 minutes, or until done. Remove pie crust dough from the fridge after it's been in there for at least 4 hours. Prepare to roll out dough. Take out 9-inch pie plate. Alternatively, if you skipped part 1 and are using a pre-made pie crust, disregard steps 3-6. Roll out dough to fit the 9-inch pie plate.  Place crust in pie plate. Press the dough evenly into the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Put pie crust in the fridge.  Remove sweet potatoes from pot when both are finished cooking. Be cautious as they will be hot. They should be soft when poked with a fork. Allow them to cool. You can run them under cold water to help with the cooling process. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Remove the skin. It should peel off very easily. Add potatoes to large bowl. Use a knife to cut them up. Use hand blender to break up sweet potatoes further, until smooth (about 3 minutes).  Add softened stick of butter (1/2 cup) and mix well with mixer.  Measure out a 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup evaporated milk, and 2 eggs.  Combine the ingredients and mix well.
