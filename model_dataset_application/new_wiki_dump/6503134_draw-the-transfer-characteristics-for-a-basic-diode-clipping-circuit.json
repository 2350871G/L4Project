In this condition, the input applied is simply reflected as output without modification. The graph is a straight line originating from the origin, having an angle of 45' with the X-axis (or Y-axis). When the input voltage exceeds the Vref, the diode (Ideal) becomes forward biased and hence it is a short circuit. The output will be equal to the magnitude of Vref. Hence, you can get a graph of a straight line from Vref point, which is parallel to the X-axis. The slope of this line is zero because, as Vinp changes, Vout does not change, but it remains constant to Vref. That is, the value of  \u0394 Vout= Vref - Vref= 0 and the value of  \u0394 Vinp= Vinp2 - Vinp1= b (some value). Therefore tan \u03b8 = 0/b = 0."

Understand the output waveform of the circuit.

Transfer characteristics must be analysed for positive and negative input voltages. Since transfer characteristics is defined as the plot of Vinp (input voltage) versus Vout (output voltage), input voltage may be positive, negative or zero. Therefore, start the analysis for both types of inputs. Make a note of the output voltage obtained for the corresponding input voltage.

Therefore \u0394 Vout = \u0394 Vinp = a (some value), now the value of tan \u03b8 = a/a=1, and hence \u03b8 = 45'. Analyse the circuit for positive input voltages. For the positive input voltages less than the Vref, the diode (Ideal) is reverse biased. Therefore, the circuit becomes open and no current flows through the circuit. In this condition, the input applied is simply reflected as output without modification. The graph is a straight line originating from the origin, having an angle of 45' with the X-axis (or Y-axis).
