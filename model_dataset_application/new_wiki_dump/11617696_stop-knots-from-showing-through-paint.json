If you\u2019re working on a large piece of wood, move other pieces of furniture out of the way or do the painting in an open garage or other work area.

If your piece of wood is brand new, the knots will be clearly visible as darker circles. Otherwise, the knots may be a slightly darker color than the rest of your painted wood. Anywhere you see a darker spot on your piece of wood should be covered up with a stain blocker."

Brush it onto the entire surface of the knot, creating a thin layer that\u2019s even with the rest of the wood. If your stain blocker is clear, don\u2019t worry if the stain appears darker after applying it. A white stain blocker should cover the stain to make it less noticeable. Avoid applying too much stain blocker to one area of the wood; otherwise, it will get too clumpy. If your white stain shellac doesn\u2019t completely cover the knot, don\u2019t worry. You can apply another coat once the first one has dried and been lightly sanded."

If your piece of wood has already been painted once and you\u2019re just going over the spots where knots are showing through, cover the entire surface of the knot to be sure none of it shows. Otherwise, apply the coat of wood paint to the entire piece of wood evenly. Water-based paints like latex or oil-based paints like alkyd-based paint are both safe on wood. If you\u2019re using a roller, pour a small amount of paint into a tray to make the application process easier. Use back and forth strokes of the roller or paint brush to create an even layer of paint. If you're just painting over the knot, make sure the paint color is an exact match and use brush strokes that go in the same direction as the previously painted layer."

If you want to add another coat of paint to the wood, use the roller or brush to apply the second coat just like you did the first. Paint slowly and evenly to be sure there aren\u2019t any drips, and cover the spots with the knots thoroughly. Read the instructions that come on your can of paint to find out how long it will take to dry, as all types of paint are different. Consider adding a sealant to the wood after you\u2019ve applied a regular coat of paint for extra protection. Wait for the additional layers to dry completely before applying the sealant."
