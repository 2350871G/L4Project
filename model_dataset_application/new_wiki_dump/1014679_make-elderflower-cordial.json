          "description":"To make elderflower cordial, you do need freshly cut elderflowers. You can either harvest these on your own if they grow in your area, or you can find them at farmers markets, local farms, or specialty grocers. Because you'll be using the flowers for food, look for spray- or pesticide-free flowers. The supplies you'll need include:\nLarge saucepan\nFruit zester\nSharp knife\nLarge heat-proof mixing bowl\nLarge bowl and funnel\nStrainer\nCheese cloth\nBottles or mason jars (with lids) for storing\nScissors\nMixing spoon\nTwo clean tea towels"

          "description":"Pour the water and sugar into a large saucepan and heat over medium heat. Stir occasionally until the sugar has dissolved. Once that happens, increase the heat slightly and bring the mixture to a boil. Once the syrup boils, remove it from the heat. Set it aside to cool as you prepare the other ingredients."

          "description":"Use your fingers to pick out any insects, dirt, and dead flowers. You don\u2019t want to wash the flowers, because washing will remove the pollen, which is where the flowers get most of their delicate flavor. Use the scissors to trim the stems off the flowers. The stems are actually poisonous and bitter, so remove as much of them as possible. A few stems in the mix won\u2019t hurt you, but you really only want the flowers to make the cordial. Place the cleaned and trimmed flowers into the heat-proof mixing bowl."

Then cut all the lemons and oranges into slices and add them to the bowl as well. Sprinkle the citric acid over the mixture. With your hands or a spoon, mix the flowers, zest, fruit slices, and citric acid together. The citric acid serves as a preservative in this recipe."

For the best results, let the cordial sit like this, covered and at room temperature, for 24 to 48 hours. This will give the syrup time to become infused with the flavors of the flowers and the citrus."

Pour in the cordial mixture, using the cheesecloth to strain out the flowers, zest, and fruit slices. Let the mixture drain through for a few minutes. You can also squeeze the fruit inside the cheesecloth to remove as much cordial as possible. If you don\u2019t have cheesecloth, you can use a piece of muslin, a jelly bag, or a clean tea towel."

To sterilize them, run the jars through the dishwasher and wash the lids by hand in hot, soapy water. Let them cool before bottling the cordial. To sterilize without a dishwasher, wash the bottles and lids by hand. Dry the bottles and leave the lids to air dry. Transfer the bottles to a roasting pan and bake them in a 320 F (160 C) oven for 10 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool."
