          "description":"If your dog is attracted to a specific piece of furniture and it just won't leave it alone, you may need to make that piece of furniture unpleasant to the dog. Putting an unpleasant taste on it may just do the trick and it may prevent your dog from continuing to chew on your furniture in the future. Use foods or seasonings that will not be toxic to your dog, such as hot sauce or cayenne pepper. If you don't want to use spices to keep your dog off your furniture, you can purchase a commercial, furniture-safe, anti-chewing spray from a retail store that specializes in pet products."

For example, you can put aluminum foil or double-sided tape on areas that your dog is attracted to. The crinkles of the foil and the stickiness of the tape will both be unappealing to your dog."

          "headline":"Use a remote deterrent to make the furniture less appealing to the dog.",
          "description":"Choose a deterrent that your dog dislikes and that will activate when the dog approaches the furniture. For example, a motion activated can of compressed air posted near the furniture could make the dog avoid the area. Don't choose anything that will emotionally scar the dog, such as a deterrent that frightens the dog. If the dog will not even enter the room at all, then you should remove the deterrent."

This will allow your dog to roam freely without damaging any valuable items or furniture. You can also place your dog and its toys in a room without furniture to prevent it from causing any damage. If you place your dog outside while you are not home, make sure that it has shelter from extreme temperatures and weather, and water and food available to it at all times."

For instance, if the piece of furniture is a chair, place something large in the chair before you leave, so that the dog cannot get in the chair. Taking a little bit of time before you leave your home to limit your dog's temptations will be beneficial to both you and your dog. Try placing baby gates around your furniture to keep your dog away."

Covering furniture with items you can wash, such as rugs, blankets, or covers, makes it easy to keep the furniture clean. Whenever the washable item gets dirty, simply throw it into a washing machine. If you're worried about the look of your living room, chose a stylish throw that's still washable. You can easily incorporate this into your decor. You can also find special blankets made to protect furniture from pet fur, urine, and feces. If your dog frequently has accidents on the couch, rugs can be a better option than other fabrics. Alternatively, you could put puppy pads or plastic covers under the blanket."
