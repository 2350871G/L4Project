They\u2019re easily consumed on the go, but are sometimes bulkier and more inconvenient than bars. Meal replacement shakes come in a variety of forms that might need freezing or refrigeration.

          "description":"A homemade meal replacement is a great option if you\u2019re looking to save money and know exactly what\u2019s going into your meal replacement. You can make either bars or shakes at home. Making your own meal replacement will help prevent the monotony that comes with eating the same meal every day. You can mix up the flavors of the smoothies or bars that you create. Cooking meal replacements yourself is a creative way to begin understanding what ingredients contribute to healthy eating. Try your hand at making your own shake with this easy recipe: blend together half an avocado, .5 cup (64 g) of spinach, half a banana, .5 tablespoon (15 g) of natural peanut butter, .5 cup (236 mL) of milk, and 3 ice cubes to make a delicious meal replacement shake. You can also make your own meal replacement bars. Mix 14 oz (400 g) natural protein powder, 7 oz (200 g) rolled oats, .75 cup (180 ml) low fat milk, 3 oz (100 g) natural peanut butter, 3 oz (100 g) honey, 1 oz (30 g) cocoa powder, and a sprinkling of flax seed (optional). Use your hands to mix the ingredients. Form thirteen even-sized bars. Place the bars in the refrigerator. They will keep for a week."
