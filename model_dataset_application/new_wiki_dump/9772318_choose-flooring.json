Choose from an extensive range of styles and patterns, then decide on a thickness. Linoleum is also DIY-friendly, since you can easily lay the flooring down with an adhesive. The thicker the linoleum, the more durable and expensive it will be. This type of flooring also works well in humid climates, whereas tiles would be more likely to crack. You can also choose a linoleum that mimics wood or marble without having to pay for the real thing."

          "description":"Ceramic tiles are beautiful, durable, dent-resistant and non-porous, so they can protect against most scratches and spills. Cleaning ceramic floor tiles is also simple if you do it regularly. Choose your tiles from a wide selection of styles, then hire a professional to install them, since this flooring can be tricky to lay down. If you have small children, you may want to choose a textured tile that won\u2019t get slippery when it\u2019s wet. Keep in mind that ceramic tiles can be prone to cracking if your house is old and experiences structural movement. However, if you replace your subfloor as well, you can still use tile flooring."

Pick out a color and texture that suits the room, whether kitchen or bathroom, and order it. You will need to hire an expert to install these heavier, more difficult materials, but the end result should look stunning."

It\u2019s also much warmer underfoot and easier on your back than other options. Choose a type of wood, width, and finish that suits your decorations and color palette. Some popular wood options include oak, maple, birch, and pine. The only downside of hardwood flooring is that the upfront cost can be quite expensive. However, with proper care, your hardwood floor will be a great investment and last you for years to come! Over time, hardwood flooring can develop scratches and dents from regular use. However, you can sand and refinish some floors up to 5 times to restore it to like-new condition."

If you\u2019re looking for a quirky, durable flooring to brighten up your room, pick out a fun pattern style from an endless array of options. If the tile begins to feel too cold or hard underfoot, you can always add some soft, thick rugs to warm it up. You can also choose between materials, such as ceramic or stone. Stone tiles, such as marble, travertine, or sandstone, are more durable, but ceramic give you a greater variety of options. Tile flooring is also very convenient for making repairs. If 1 tile chips or cracks, then you only need to replace that 1, rather than the entire floor."

          "description":"If you\u2019re looking for something more plush, warm, and inviting for a space where you usually go barefoot, go with carpet. Choose from a variety of styles, colors, piles, and costs to find the perfect carpet for your room. Make sure to lay down a nice, thick pad beneath it as well for added comfort. Carpet comes in different materials, as well as textured, looped, twisted, or patterned types, so try walking on a sample of each type before choosing your favorite. For example, you could go with a classic wool or durable nylon carpet. Carpet is also a good choice for cold or open rooms that need some sound-proofing."
