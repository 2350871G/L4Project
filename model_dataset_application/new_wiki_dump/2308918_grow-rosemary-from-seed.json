Rosemary seedlings will do best if you don\u2019t transplant them until they're well-established, the risk of frost has past, and the ground has had time to warm up. If you started the seeds inside 10 to 12 weeks before the last frost, the rosemary should be ready to go outside in late May.

Use a spade or your hand to dig holes in the soil that are large enough to accommodate the rosemary root balls. Space the holes 18 to 24 inches (46 to 61 cm) apart. Place one rosemary plant in each hole and cover the roots with fresh soil. Water when the soil dries out. Rosemary is somewhat drought-resistant and doesn\u2019t like to be overwatered.
