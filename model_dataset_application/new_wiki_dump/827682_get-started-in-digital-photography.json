      "description":"Know how to use most, if not all, of the features on your camera. Most cameras offer a \"full automatic\" mode, which is great for those beginning into digital photography. Just compose the shot and take the picture. As you become more advanced, you can start to try out the other various modes on your camera."

      "headline":"Get out and take pictures.",
      "description":"You won't get better at anything without practice. Take your camera with you wherever you go, and always be ready to take a picture. While you are out, try out new techniques or ideas that you have come up with. Try to get the picture that you can visualize in your head beforehand."

      "headline":"Learn how to use post-processing programs.",
      "description":"The two major programs are Adobe Photoshop and GIMP. These can be extremely complicated, technical, and hard to use, but once you master the basics you will be very happy that you took the time to learn. For beginning photographers, GIMP is perfect because it is completely free. It is similar to Photoshop, but a little bit less daunting and much less expensive. Start by reading a few articles on how to use GIMP, then spend time experimenting with your own images. There is an excellent video podcast on how to use GIMP called Meet the Gimp."

Join a beginning photographers group and ask any questions that you have. Look at other people's photographs, analyze them, try to duplicate them, and then apply what you have learned to your own photography."
