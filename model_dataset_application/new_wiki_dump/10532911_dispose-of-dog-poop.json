          "description":"While it may seem like it's fine to leave dog poop in your own yard, it can contain bacteria and other parasites. They can infect you if you do any gardening, as well as any kids who play in the backyard. If the dog poop gets in the storm drain, those same bacteria and parasites can show up in local lakes and rivers where people swim. It can infect people who swim in those areas or even end up in shellfish consumed by people."

Bagging the poop to send to the landfill is the best way to contain and kill any bacteria living in it. You can even use the bag to scoop up the poop. Put it over your hand, inside-out. Grab the poop with your hand covered in plastic, then flip the bag around it."

If it's a straight bag, like a bag meant for scooping poop or a grocery bag for vegetables, tie a single knot in it by making a loop with the top half of the bag and pulling the top end through the loop. Sealing up the bag helps ensure bacteria and other parasites won't get out."

If you're away from your home, stick it in a public trash can or a disposable unit specifically designed for dog poop. Always carry plastic bags with when you take your dog out."

You should never flush a regular plastic bag, as the city's septic systems won't be able to handle it. Once you put the poop in it, simply flush it away. You don't have to buy special bags; you can simply dump the poop out of the bag into the toilet and toss the bag into the trash. You can even buy what amounts to a toilet for the backyard, specifically made for dog poop. One such product is called the Powerloo. It's connected to your sewer line, and you can scoop the poop directly into it."
