For the best snowballs, seek out snow from areas where the ground may be warmer. Wetter snow makes for better snowballs. Heat is often given off by a house. Snow close to buildings may be warmer than average. Snow that's exposed to the sun may be warmer than snow you would find in the shade. If you can't find warmer snow, lie down on the ground for a few minutes. The heat from your body will melt the snow slightly, adding moisture. This will make for better snowballs. If it's possible, choose to have a snowball fight during the afternoon. Snow tends to be more shapeable when the weather is slightly warmer, so playing when the sun is out can give you a better selection of snow."
