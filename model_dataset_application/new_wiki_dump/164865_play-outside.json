          "headline":"Build a fort.",
          "description":"You can make your fort as simple or as complex as you like. Choose an area that will make a good floor, such as soft grass or flat dirt. Put a picnic rug and cushions onto the ground to make it feel extra cozy. Place outdoor furniture (such as outdoor chairs) around your floor area. Hang blankets between the chairs to create walls. If you have a big blanket, drape it over the top of all the chairs to create a roof. If you have a big tree in your backyard, lean sticks against the tree trunk to make a teepee. If you don\u2019t have the right equipment to build a fort, ask your parents if you can put up a tent instead. If your parents give you permission, you could even sleep overnight in it."

          "headline":"Practice your photography skills.",
          "description":"Ask your parents if you can use their smartphone, tablet, or camera to take photos outside. Look around the garden, or your neighborhood, for things you might like to photograph. Look for things that are different colors, shapes, and sizes, that might make interesting photos. Hunt for insects and take photos of the ones you find. If you have a pet, try taking some photos of it. Take a picture while it does a trick or when it is running in the yard. Make sure you are careful with the camera as they can be really expensive to repair or replace."

        {
          "headline":"Hang out with your pets.",
          "description":"Playing with your pets is a great way to pass time. Try to teach your dog new tricks, like turning around or lying on its tummy. You could also create a small obstacle course for your dog and teach it to go through it. If you have a cat (or rabbit or guinea pig) you could play with them in the shade and give them lots of pats. Make sure you supervise small animals like rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice, when they are outside."

          "headline":"Fly a kite if there\u2019s some wind.",
          "description":"If there\u2019s a bit of wind, take the opportunity to practice your kite flying skills. See how long you can keep your kite in the air for, or how high you get it. Make sure to fly your kite away from power lines and trees. If you don\u2019t have a kite, try making your own. Don\u2019t fly your kite on a gusty day, as this makes flying hard and can cause the kite to break."

          "headline":"Jump on the trampoline.",
          "description":"If you have a trampoline at home, there are endless ways you can play on it. Count how many times you can bounce from your bottom onto your knees, or practice jumping onto your back and then landing on your feet. Bring one of your soft toys onto the trampoline and see how high you can bounce it. Always be extra careful when practicing flips or new moves. If you have chalk, draw a circle in the middle of the trampoline and see how many times you can bounce in the same spot."

          "headline":"Go on a scavenger hunt.",
          "description":"There are probably lots more hidden treasures in your backyard than you realise. Go on a hunt to find as many different kinds of leaves, rocks, insects, or flowers as you can. Arrange them in a cool way to show your parents. If you have a journal, you could document all your different finds by drawing pictures and describing where you found them. If you don\u2019t have a journal you could take a picture instead. Use the rocks you find to start a cool rock collection. Keep adding to over it time."

Get your friend to stand still on a concrete surface, while you trace around the shadow of their body. Trade places, and let your friend have a go at drawing your shadow. Once you have traced your shadows you can colour them in and draw clothes onto them. Be creative and use different colors and patterns. Hold your body in different positions to create different shadows. Try putting your arms up or to the side to create a different silhouette."

          "description":"Create an obstacle course with your friends using items from in the garden, as well as the trees and bushes in your yard. For example, you could run to the washing line, crawl under a bush, run around a tree, climb under an outdoor table and run back to the starting line. Time each person and see who can do it the quickest. Try making a simple obstacle course and doing it blindfolded. Make sure someone follows the blinded person to ensure they don\u2019t hurt themselves. If your obstacle course gets a bit boring, add in some more obstacles."

          "headline":"Play on a waterslide.",
          "description":"When it\u2019s hot, waterslides are the perfect way to spend an afternoon. Set up a waterslide on a flat area that is close to the hose. Turn on the hose and take turns sliding down. You could also get out your water guns and have a water fight while you\u2019re already wet. If you feel like playing a game, sit on your knees and wrestle each other off the waterslide. The winner is the person that stays on the waterslide the longest. If you don\u2019t have a waterslide, turn on the sprinkler and run over it with your friends. Play games under the sprinkler or just run around and have fun. Make sure to wear sunscreen while you\u2019re in the sun."

You could stop in at your friends houses or check out a local park. Always tell your parents before you leave the property. Make sure you wear a helmet when you\u2019re riding a bike."

When you start to catch more of the throws, try stepping back a couple of steps to make it a bit trickier. If you want a real challenge, try throwing the frisbee in the opposite hand. Frisbee is easier to play if it\u2019s not windy."

There are lots of variations of tag you can try if you get bored of regular tag. Try group tag where once you have been tagged you help the tagger to tag more people, or band-aid tag where the person has to hold the body part where they have been tagged. Swap taggers if the tagger is struggling to tag anyone, this will make it more fun for everyone. Decide on where the boundaries will be before you start the game."
