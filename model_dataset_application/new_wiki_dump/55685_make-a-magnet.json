The nail will become magnetized either way; the only difference is that its polarity will change. One side of the magnet is the north pole, and one side is the south pole. Reversing the wires will also reverse the poles. Once the battery is attached, the wires will grow hot as electricity begins passing through them, so be careful not to burn yourself."
