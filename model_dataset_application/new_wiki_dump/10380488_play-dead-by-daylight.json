The higher quality the emblem, the more pips you get. If your emblem quality is low enough, you can actually lose pips, thus losing rank, so play safely. Every rank needs a certain amount of pips to progress to the next, and rank ups will steadily get harder to achieve as you progress."

Learning how to keep a level head when loud music is roaring in your ears and your in-game heart is beating will keep you off the hook. Vaulting is an effective way to extend a chase for a small amount of time. Simply sprint at the window and press space when the prompt comes up to quickly vault the window. Killers normally vault windows at half your speed, so they will most likely go around the vault rather than over it. Be aware that vaulting a window quickly will trigger a noise prompt for the killer if they aren't in a chase. Using pallets to your advantage is the most popular tactic in the DBD community. Press space to throw down a pallet when running through it. After a pallet is downed, survivors can either slowly or quickly vault over it. Quickly vaulting over the pallet will create a noise notification. The pallet cannot be reused, and once the killer breaks it it is no longer useful. Downing a pallet when the killer is in the hitbox will stun them for a brief period, adding to the time before they can resume the chase. Hiding is a high risk medium reward tactic, and can be incredibly effective if paired with other chase tactics. Hiding can allow you to avoid the chase entirely if pulled off, but can allow the killer to get a free hit on you if they spot you before you can put difference between yourself and them."

After you've injured a survivor, they leave pools of blood that last slightly longer than scratch marks. These pools of blood may be hard to follow, but can be brightened with certain perks and addons. If your headphones are a high enough quality, you can hear survivors breathing and hear cries of pain if they are injured. Injured and uninjured breathing can be amplified with perks.
