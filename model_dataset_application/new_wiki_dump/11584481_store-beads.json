The most popular bead storage containers are generally plastic tray containers that have several compartments where you can separate your beads, as well as an attached lid to keep your beads from spilling out. Some bead storage tray containers are made to snap together, so you can keep all your beads securely together in one storage area. Bead organizing cases are generally made to be airtight so even the smallest of beads won\u2019t spill out."

          "description":"If you want to store your beads on a tabletop or shelf so that they\u2019re still visible and easy to access, using empty spice jars and a spice rack is a great choice. You can separate your beads so that each jar holds a different set of beads for an easy-to-find, visually appealing storage option. To make your beads even easier to find and access, purchase a Lazy Susan spice rack that spins around on your tabletop."

Most pill organizers are made so that you can choose to open only one compartment at a time, making it easy for you to access the beads you need while keeping the others locked in place. Pill organizers can cost as little as $1 USD, making them a great cost-effective bead storage solution. You can also organize small beads in ice cube trays."

While tackle box compartments aren\u2019t generally as airtight as pill or bead-specific organizers, bigger beads are less likely to spill through the cracks and will likely stay in their designated compartments. Tackle boxes are also a good option for storing beads that you only have a few of and keep in small plastic baggies. The larger compartments allow you to separate the beads in the baggies by size, color, or material and keep them all together. Art supply and tool boxes are both good alternatives to a tackle box."

With particularly small beads, you\u2019ll be able to store hundreds of beads in a single test tube, keep them secure with the cork or plastic lid, and have them on display and easy to find, if you choose. Once you store your small beads in test tubes, you can organize the tubes in a test tube rack or lipstick holder if you want the tubes to stay upright and on display, or in a basket or box if you don\u2019t mind laying them on their sides."

This will make it easy for you to pull out all your options for a single material and assess what you want to use when you\u2019re making a new piece.

Organizing by color not only makes it easy for you to see what\u2019s available when you need a certain color bead, it also tends to be more visually appealing than other types of organization. If you choose to organize your beads first by material, you can then further subdivide and organize all the beads made of that material by color within each storage area or container. For example, you may have all your stone beads stored in one section of your storage area, and then have all your blue stone beads in one type of container, green in another, and so on."

For example, if you have all of your blue stone beads stored in one part of your storage area, you can then further organize them by placing all your small blue stone beads in test tubes, then your medium-sized beads in a spice rack, and then all of your large blue stone beads in a tackle box.
