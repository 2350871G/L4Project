          "description":"Use your fingers to break up the chocolate if it is soft or thin enough, and set it aside. For denser chocolate, place the chocolate on a cutting board and cut it up with a sharp knife. If you are using chocolate chips or chocolate that is already portioned into small pieces, then leave the chocolate as is."

The circumference of the pot should be wide enough to allow the mixing bowl to rest on top, but not so wide that the bowl falls into the pot. Fill the bottom of the pot with water and bring it to a boil. If you do not have a pot size that will support your mixing bowl, you can also use a saucepan."

It is okay if the bottom of the mixing bowl is touching the water, but make sure it is not submerged. The double boiler will make it easier to melt the chocolate for the fondue. If you already have a double boiler system that works well for you, use that to create the fondue instead."

Lower the heat on the stovetop to a medium-low temperature if the cream starts to bubble. If you are using a saucepan instead of a pot, make sure to use a potholder to hold the mixing bowl still when you stir. Add 4 cinnamon sticks or 1/2 tsp (1.15 g) of ground cinnamon to the cream while it is heating to give the finished fondue a festive taste. Then, let the cinnamon steep in the cream for 15 minutes off the stove. If you used cinnamon sticks, remove them after the cream is heated and before adding the chocolate. If you prefer, you can steep the heated cream with 1/2 tsp (1.15 g) of ground cinnamon and ancho chili pepper for a spicy Mexican chocolate fondue, or steep the cream with your favorite tea for a subtle earthy flavor."

If the fondue seems too thick, whisk in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of heavy cream to thin it. Add more heavy cream if needed to reach a desired consistency."

Elevate the flavor of the fondue by spiking it with 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of your favorite alcohol or liquor. The alcohol will cut the sweetness of the chocolate and compliment the vanilla extract nicely. Start by trying brandy, rum, amaretto, or Bailey\u2019s Irish Cream. Instead of vanilla extract, experiment with other extract flavorings and match the taste of the fondue to the occasion. Contrast a dark chocolate or bittersweet fondue by adding 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of orange extract, or make a white chocolate fondue festive by adding 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of peppermint extract."

If you do not have a fondue pot, pour the mixture into a chafing dish or ceramic bowl. Then, wrap a towel around the base of the bowl to trap the heat.
