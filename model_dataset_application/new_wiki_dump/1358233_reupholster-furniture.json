If you attempt to do so on a piece of furniture that is poor quality, you'll experience two things: increased difficulty with the process, and an increased likelihood that the furniture won't last long (making your time/money investment pointless). Start out on the right foot by selecting furniture that is high quality with an ugly 'skin'. Look for furniture that is made of solid wood, not veneer or plywood. Solid wood will maintain its value and last a very long time, while veneers and plywood furniture aren't quality enough to last very long. Check the furniture for any squeaks, noises, or imbalances. Move the furniture around a bit - if it wobbles or makes noises when you do, it's not in fantastic shape and probably isn't worth reupholstering. Look at the overall construction to determine if there is any major damage or problem areas. Nails/screws that are sticking out or missing, broken boards/pieces, or sagging areas may be a sign that the furniture will require more work to fix up than you want to put into it."

          "description":"Although you can technically reupholster furniture with any kind of fabric, most fabrics won't be thick and sturdy enough to last for many years. Look for special upholstering fabric, which is thicker and made to stand against wear-and-tear better than other types of fabric. Keep in mind that the type of furniture you use will depend on the placement of the piece; you can get away with using regular fabric on a piece of furniture that won't be frequently used, but you'll definitely need upholstering fabric for pieces that are used often (like a couch). Because reupholstering is such a time-consuming process, try to select a fabric that is relatively neutral and will stand the test of time in terms of style. That way, it will fit with your interior design preferences for more time than a bold or trendy fabric choice would. If you get a patterned fabric, try to choose one that won't require you to match specific sections of the pattern (like wallpaper) when you cut it into sections. You can still use a cut-specific pattern like this, but it will take much more time trying to lay the pattern out so that each piece is going the same direction as all the other pieces."

Use your flat-head screwdriver or butter knife to carefully pull out every staple. Do not cut any of the fabric to remove it, as you will be using the pre-existing fabric as your pattern for the new upholstering fabric. If you're removing fabric from a couch, you'll need to flip it over and take the fabric off the bottom and back as well. Remove any cushions that might be there, but if they don't have a zipper, you might be able to make a cover for them rather than removing all the current fabric. Side panels of fabric (like on a sofa) may not require fabric removal, because often you can tack your new fabric over the top. Be careful not to cut yourself on the staples or tacks, as these are a very real tetanus threat."

Use a bit of wood oil or cleaner to prepare the wood parts of your furniture, and seal it if necessary. If your furniture was damaged or scratched, you should take time now to repair it and prep it for new fabric. If you want to stain or paint the wood on your furniture, you should do so at this point."

Once you've gotten all the pieces measured/traced, you can very carefully cut out each section, making sure that you mark or keep track of where on the furniture it will be put.
