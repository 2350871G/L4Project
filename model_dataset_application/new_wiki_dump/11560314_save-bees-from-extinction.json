Synthetic products, particularly those that contain neonicotinoid chemicals, will not only keep bees from finding a safe home in your yard, they can also endanger their lives by poisoning them over time. Even some organic pesticides can be harmful to bees. Therefore, make sure you check the ingredients list to make sure it\u2019s safe for bees. A few safe options include pesticides using garlic, kaolin clay, corn gluten, and bacillus thuringiensis."
