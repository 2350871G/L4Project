You can get several different sizes of \u201cv\u201d shaped knives. If you purchase a range of sizes, you will be able to make many different kinds of cuts. These tools can be purchased at specialty cooking supply depots or online. Purchase a knife sharpener as well. If you sharpen your knives they will create better cuts."

Lastly, experiment with your other tools, such as your \u201cv\u201d shaped knife, to figure out the different kinds of cuts you can make. For example, the \u201cv\u201d shaped knife is especially good at making thin, clean grooves. If you use smooth movements, you can make straight lines or graceful curves. When using the paring knife, practice making straight cuts and curved cuts."

If they encounter too much resistance, you may apply too much pressure and accidentally cut yourself.Consider purchasing protective woodcarving gloves. These gloves will insulate your fingers against the sharp edge of a knife. If you carve a juicy or slimy fruit or vegetable, wash the handles of your tools often. This will help prevent them from becoming too slick to use safely."
