It's a bit like a bank account number, except that it can only be used to deposit a specific cryptocurrency (in this case, Dogecoin).Your wallet address will be displayed when you open your wallet app. It's a long string of characters, typically including upper- and lower-case letters along with numbers. Your wallet will also have a QR code that you can scan to deposit Doges into your wallet without having to copy that long string of characters.Tip: Your public address doesn't need to be kept secret. However, your private keys do. Anyone who has your private keys has your Dogecoin, and if you lose your private keys, you lose your Dogecoin."
