  "text":" Steps Gather all the materials needed, listed below in the \"Things You'll Need\" section.  Prepare your work space. You must work in a well ventilated area. Creating the Plant Pot Holder Start with the sample. Here's a sample on how the bunny plant holder would look like as a whole. Take this boost to get you going, save and print the attached picture above. It is scaled to match the 1.5 liter plastic bottle size. Print it on a 8.5 inches x 11 inches board paper. Note: Do not check the scale to fit media box before printing. If you don't have a printer, you can always do it manually by hand. Ask someone you know who have the skills. Cut the printed paper board along the cutting line and attach it to the lower part of the plastic bottle. Align the nose part of the bunny in between the plastic bottle bottom stand. Adjust the height of the bunny according to the height of the plant pot. Use the marker to mark the plastic bottle along the cutting line and around the back of the bottle.  Remove the paper and keep it aside. Start cutting the plastic bottle using a cutter. Cut a small part outside the marked line. Get the scissor and insert it in the small cut then start cutting. It is advised not to use the cutter to cut the whole piece as it can easily slide off and cut yourself or even ruin your project. Wipe the plastic bottle then start coating it with a plastic primer. Place it in a ventilated area and spray it inside and out. Let it dry according to package direction. Spray it with white paint of your choice. Using spray paint is better than brush painting  because it makes a smooth and even finish. You can use the glossy one for a shiny finish. Let it dry according to package direction. Creating the Drip Pan Place the grass mat on top of the baking pan to get the right size. Cut the grass mat using a cutter. Set the grass mat aside. Glue 2 pieces of popsicle sticks together and glue it on all sides of the baking pan. Cut the popsicle sticks according to the width of the sides. Brush the baking pan with aluminum primer on all sides and the insides. leave the popsicle exposed as well the bottom of the pan. Let it dry according to package direction. Paint over the primer with green latex. Let it dry according to package direction. While the paint dries, you can start cutting the popsicle in half. These are what makes the fences on the sides. Mark each popsicle stick using a guide before cutting them. When the drip pan paint is thoroughly dry, stick each popsicle cuts on each sides using a super glue. Leave a small gap in between each sticks. Set it aside when finished. Finishing and Assembly Assuming the plastic bottle is dry, make a small hole on each of the 5 stands at the bottom. This is to allow the excess water to pass through. To make a hole, grab a nail using pliers and then carefully drill a hole on each stand. Let's draw the face of the bunny. Get the printed paper board with the bunny pattern and place it on a cutting mat. Using a sharp cutter, cut the eyes, nose, mouth, ears part. etc.. When done, place the paper board again in the plastic bottle and start tracing lightly using a marker. Take off the paper board when finished. You can draw it manually if you missed any detail. If you want, you can add a light pink blush on the cheeks using your mom's cosmetics. This will work on a non glossy paint, use a pink spray paint if not. Before assembling the parts, you can also spray a quick-dry top coat on all components for dust and water protection. Put the components together and you're finished.",
