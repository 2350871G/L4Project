          "description":"For many in today\u2019s world of communication, CB radio seems like an outdated method of contact. CB radio still has many benefits depending on how you use the device. For desolate environments, like mountains or deserts, CB radio can be the most effective device to contact people. The radio signal is short wave, so you can only contact those in a 40 to 100 mile radius, depending on the device/antenna you have. You should probably have a contact you are planning to communicate with using the CB radio. Another use for CB radio is for safety contacts. If you are going on a long road trip through desolate areas, CB radio can be a vital tool to connect with the police."

Consider what you need the radio for to help decide what price you want to spend. If you are using the radio for fun between friends, don\u2019t spend more than $50. If you are setting up a radio communications system for work, spend a little extra for a reliable machine."

          "description":"The most common place to mount a CB radio is in your car. It is important to mount the radio in a location that won\u2019t impinge your safety while driving. A common place to place your radio is underneath the driver\u2019s seat. This ensures that you won\u2019t mess with the radio while driving. Some CB radios come with mounting hardware that will require you to modify your vehicle. Only the larger, older models require you to do this type of installation. Smaller CBs don\u2019t require any serious installation and can work in the dashboard. Check the mounting instructions before purchasing the CB radio."

          "headline":"Select and mount an antenna.",
          "description":"You can get large antennas for a wider range in service, but will require more time to install. There are small profile antennas that are only 2 feet, like the Walcott, which can even be used on motorcycles. The best place to mount your antenna is on the center of your roof. Depending on what antenna you have, you might have to drill holes into your vehicle. Check the installation requirements of the antenna before purchasing it. If you want an easier installation process, you can invest in a magnetic antenna."

There are 40 stations for CB radio and you\u2019re sure to find someone talking on one of these stations. Listen out for some common CB codes:\n10-1 means the reception is poor. 10-4 means messaged received. 10-7 means out of service. 10-9 means repeat message\n10-20 means what\u2019s your location?"

If no one responds, re-issue a radio check, but wait patiently before doing so. When another operator responds, interpret their response. Many operators are truck drivers who aren't looking for conversation. Others are enthusiasts that can not wait to chat. Follow the tone of the other person/people. Be polite. Nobody wants to communicate with a rude operator. Also be sure not to take up too much air time while on a crowded station."

Say something simple like, \u201cThis Wendy at the old lodge, over.\u201d Wait a couple moments before sending out the signal again. Once your contact responds, you can use the CB to chat.
