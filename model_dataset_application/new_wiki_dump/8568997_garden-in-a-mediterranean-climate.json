They don\u2019t require much water and can be grown in barren areas. Supplement their growing area with gravel. Stones absorb heat, helping the plants grow."

          "description":"Look around your area for inspiration when selecting plants. The shrubs and succulents that grow naturally here are evergreens. Many of them have deep roots and features that limit water loss. Substitute taller, greener plants for thinner, smaller, and grey-green shrubbery and succulents such as aloe and agave. The off-green color of these plants helps them reflect sunlight. Some plants that grow in this climate can also shed their leaves during dry periods or reorient their leaves to avoid direct sunlight."

          "headline":"Add fruit trees.",
          "description":"Many important fruit crops come from Mediterranean climates. Olive, pomegranate, and fig trees naturally occur there, as well as pistachios. However, other trees, such as citrus and nut trees, thrive during the winter. Give them adequate amounts of sunlight and water and they\u2019ll grow well. Many trees in Mediterranean climates are small and thin in order to survive with minimal water. Some larger trees including oaks and pines are common in Mediterranean greenlands, so you can grow them along with fruit trees in your environment."

Many flowers well-known in gardening from northern parts of the world, such as rhododendrons and azaleas, struggle in this dry Mediterranean climate. These flowers grow slowly and require lots of shade and water. Instead, choose plants such as rockrose, jasmine, wisteria, and climbing vines. Drought-resistant roses such as teas also do well here."

Leafy vegetables such as kale and root vegetables such as carrots are some of many plants that do well in winter. Begin planting in September and plan on harvesting by spring.

Herbs such as sage and rosemary, for example, prefer full sun while others thrive in part or full shade. Put space between your plants so that they don\u2019t shade each other and their roots don\u2019t compete for water. Vine plants such as cucumbers climb on vertical growing platforms to get sunlight. These platforms can be used as shade for other plants. Some plants, including leafy vegetables such as lettuce, benefit from some shade, while others, such as spinach require more shade and should be grown in smaller amounts. Don\u2019t be afraid to move plants during the evening or hang sheets over vulnerable plants during the afternoon in order to give them some shade."

Separate your plants according to low need, medium need, and high need. Allot your water as needed and consider replacing your area of high-need plants with native varieties in case of drought. Plant high need plants in low areas where water drains well. Plants of low and moderate water need can be supplemented with mulch and compost to retain water. Account for your lawn if you have one. Lawns consume a lot of water and limit what you can afford for thirsty plants such as begonias and hydrangeas."

It can be bought in lawn and garden stores or made at home. Place a couple of inches of dark, moist compost around your vegetables and flowers to help them grow. Compost provides nitrogen lacking in Mediterranean-climate soil and also helps hold in moisture. Remember to aerate the compost and water it throughout the season. When it begins to solidify and become less crumbly, moisten it again."

Gravel also helps hold in heat for drought-resistant plants. Plants that prefer poor soil, such as herbs, benefit more from gravel than organic mulch. Mulch also limits the amount of weeding work you need to do."

Not only do some plants suffer in wet soil, water is a commodity during drought months. Add enough water to moisten the soil of most plants every week. Deeply soak plants with a high water need.

Connect your garden hose to your faucet then connect smaller hoses to the other end of the hose. Poke holes in the smaller hoses, then turn on the water. Instead of the spray from the big hose, water will dribble out of the holes. Another way to do this is to poke a hole in a bucket and set it on the mulch before filling it. Many companies sell drip irrigation systems and kits. You can add timers, pressure systems, and sprayers to control your water use."
