          "description":"Upright vacuums are likely what you think of when you picture a vacuum. They have a long handle and a foot lever. Though these vacuums aren't quite as a maneuverable as some other options, they tend to work a little better at picking up dust and debris. These types of vacuums tend to work best if you have deep carpets. They get the ground-in dirt better than other options. The drawback to upright vacuums is you must rely on attachments to do things like get into corners and go up and down stairs. They also tend to be the loudest of the vacuums.

Chris Willatt, the owner of Alpine Maids, says: \"The most important thing is that you choose a vacuum with a good roller brush in it, as well as something with a lot of power. Stick vacuums are good for a kitchen, but they might not be strong enough for a bedroom or a living room. Canisters tend to have the most sucking power, but uprights have come a long way, and they're easier to use.\""

          "description":"A canister vacuum has a motor attached to a hose. The hose is then connected to a long wand you can use to vacuum. Because you're not moving the motor around as much, it can make the vacuum seem lighter. Plus, the hose and wand make it easier to get into corners and on stairs. This type of vacuum works well if you need to get into a lot of nooks and crannies or go up and down stairs. The downside to this vacuum is they are little bulky and don't fit as easily in a closet. Plus, their sucking power isn't quite as good as uprights. They are also relatively loud."

          "description":"If you hate vacuuming, then a robot vacuum is the best choice for you. These vacuums map out your room and move about all on their own, picking up dirt as they go. These vacuums are relatively quiet. Robot vacuums can work on bare or carpeted floors, but they'll only pick up the top layer of dirt. You'll likely need to deep clean with another vacuum. On the flip side, they don't work as well as uprights or canisters, and they only have a small holding area for dirt, meaning they need to be emptied often."

          "description":"This type of vacuum is basically a lightweight upright. It's great if you hate lifting larger vacuums because it is light and easy to move around. Stick vacuums can be quieter than other options, though not always. The downside to these vacuums is they don't pick up as much dirt as their heavier duty cousins, so they work best on lighter carpet."

          "description":"A handheld vacuum is one that doesn't have a long wand or stick for you to use to vacuum. Instead, you must bend over to use it. These types of vacuums are great for small spills that you need to clean up quickly. While you can use these vacuums over larger areas, it's going to get tedious after a while. This option is your best bet for a car, particularly if you choose a cordless type."

With bags, you create less dust because you're pulling the whole bag of the vacuum with the dust in it. On the other hand, sometimes the replacement bags are hard to find or expensive."

Plus, a bagless container makes it easier to find something you lost and vacuumed up, such as an earring. However, you must keep the filters clean with this type of vacuum, and it can release a lot of dust when you're dumping the container."

While some options are cordless, most traditional and canister vacuums have cords. Check the cord length and measure the length of your rooms to make sure you can cover the whole room fairly easily. Most upright and canister vacuums have cords, while only some handheld and stick models do. Robot vacuums are also cordless."

If you're just getting it for spot cleanups, the charge doesn't need to be terribly long. However, if you're getting it to cover a room, you'll need it to run at least 10-15 minutes on 1 charge. It's also useful to have an easy-to-read battery display, so you know how long you have left before the battery runs out."

          "description":"Every category of vacuum will have more eco-friendly options. Some save energy, while others may use less plastic or need replacing less often. Durability is a key factor to being eco-friendly. That is, having a vacuum that lasts longer means creating less waste. Repair your old vacuum, or choose a model that has high ratings for durability. Look specifically at how much power each vacuum uses. Lower consumption of power is better for the environment. Choose uncoated bags or filters for a more environmentally friendly option. Uncoated bags can be recycled, or use a bagless vacuum so you don't need bags at all."

Think about what you need to clean before deciding what you require in a vacuum. If you have pets, look for a vacuum that's marketed specifically for pet owners, as it will likely have the attachments you need. Some also come with fan-cleaning wands, stair cleaners, wall cleaners, and crevices cleaners."
