You can even do the release indoors in a high-ceilinged venue to avoid harmful environmental impact and lessen cleanup. Make sure that you have the proper permission to rent or reserve the space for a balloon-reelease event if you need it. Avoid holding the event by a lake or other body of water, or within 500 miles upwind of the sea. While this might seem ideal for its open space, it will be too difficult or impossible to retrieve the fallen balloons after the release, and leaving them in the water is both littering and a threat to the wildlife in that body of water."

Preparing the Balloons Visit a party supply store. Go to a party supply store or a general retailer that sells balloons. Purchase the number of balloons you decided on for your guests. Keep in mind any restrictions that your city and county has on the number allowed, and remember that you will need to pick up all of the balloons after the release.
