If making your own drinks, always use attractive bottles, jars and other containers. Label with a unique and interesting label that includes date of production and details about using the drink and any tips. Don't simply stick a bottle of wine into a wine bottle bag. Instead, consider a beautiful box lined with a soft, silky fabric and finished off with a ribbon. Or place several bottles into a wine bottle basket or perhaps bottles and matching food into a picnic basket. Such additions turn a simple bottle into a complete gift. Look for unusually shaped bottles when buying the drinks. On their own, these can be an exciting gift and the recipient can decide to keep the bottle once the drink has been consumed."
