          "headline":"Gather your supplies and heat the oven.",
          "description":"Preheat your oven to 425 F (218 C). This recipe will make about 12 scones. Along with your ingredients, you'll also need:\nLarge bowl and mixing spoon\nSifter\nPastry cutter or two table knives\nFork\n2.5-inch (6-cm) cookie cutter\nSmall bowl and whisk\nPastry brush\nUngreased baking sheet\nWire cooling rack"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Combine the dry ingredients.",
          "description":"Place the sifter over the large bowl and pour in all the dry ingredients, including the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cayenne, and salt. Tap the sifter against the side of your hand to knock the ingredients into the bowl. If you don\u2019t have a sifter, put the ingredients right into the bowl and whisk them together."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cut in the butter.",
          "description":"Add the cold butter cubes to the bowl and cut them into the flour with pastry cutter or knives. Continue working in the butter until the dry ingredients and butter come together and form pea-sized crumbs. Mixing in the butter this way will ensure that the scones are light and fluffy, rather than dense and heavy."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add the cheese and milk.",
          "description":"Once added, use the fork to mix the ingredients together. You want everything to come together as a slightly sticky ball of dough. Stop when all the ingredients are incorporated, otherwise the gluten in the flour will start to develop, and you'll have tough scones. For an extra punch of flavor, you can also add in a clove of grated garlic."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Knead, roll, and cut the dough.",
          "description":"Turn the dough out onto a flat, floured surface, such as a countertop. Flour your hands and knead the dough for 30 seconds to a minute, about 10 times. Use your hands to roll out the dough. Don\u2019t use a rolling pin, as it\u2019s too heavy. It will flatten the dough too much and your scones won\u2019t rise. Spread out the dough until it\u2019s about three-quarters of an inch (1.9 cm) thick. Use the cookie cutter to cut out circles from the dough. If you don\u2019t have a cookie cutter, use the rim of a drinking glass or mug. When you\u2019ve cut out as many circles as you can, roll up the remaining dough, work it back into a ball, and pat it out again. Arrange the scones on the baking sheet, leaving at least one inch (2.5 cm) between them."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Brush the tops with egg wash.",
          "description":"Break the egg into the small bowl and beat it with the whisk. Use the pastry brush to wipe a thin layer of egg on top of each scone. This will help the tops of the scones develop a nice golden color. Instead of egg, you can also brush a bit of milk onto the scones."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Bake the scones.",
          "description":"Place the scones onto the middle rack in the oven and bake them for 12 minutes. Check on them at the 12-minute mark, and cook them for another three minutes if necessary. The scones are done when they develop a golden color."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Serve warm.",
          "description":"Remove the scones from the oven after 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer them to a wire rack and allow them to cool just long enough that they can be handled. Serve the scones either on their own, or with extra butter, jam, or more cheese."

For this recipe, you will also need your ingredients, one large and one small bowl, a whisk, a greased baking sheet, a sharp knife, and a spoon or fork. Instead of greasing the baking sheet, you can line it with parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet."

For an extra savory dish, you can also cut up some cooked ham into small bites as well to make ham and cheese scones. Add them to the mixture when you add the scallions."

          "headline":"Add the remaining ingredients.",

Add the mustard and hot sauce as well. Instead of milk, you can also substitute in cream, ricotta cheese, or sour cream for a richer and slightly heavier scone. Good mustard choices for these scones include spicy, horseradish, and Dijon. Both the mustard and hot sauce are optional ingredients in this recipe. Leaving them out will result in a tasty scone that isn't spicy."

With lightly floured hands, roll the dough out into a circle with a diameter of eight or nine inches (20 or 23 cm), and a thickness of about one inch (2.5 cm). Cut the dough in half horizontally, then again vertically. For smaller scones, cut each of those quarters into thirds, for a total of 12 scones. For larger scones, cut each quarter in half, for a total of eight scones."

They are ready when they turn golden brown and are firm to the touch. Remove the scones from the oven when they're cooked and serve immediately, as soon as they're cool enough to be touched without burning the hands. They can also be served warm or at room temperature. Place leftovers in an air-tight container and store at room temperature for up to a few days."
