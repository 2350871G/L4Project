          "description":"Mix a tablespoon (5 grams) of cornflour or cornstarch into 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of water. Stir them together to make a paste, then add the paste to the stew. Stir the stew until the paste is fully mixed. Cook for 2 minutes over medium heat to allow the cornstarch to mix into the soup. Check the consistency of the stew and add more paste if necessary. Remember to cook the soup for 2 more minutes after adding the paste. Arrowroot can be substituted for cornflour or cornstarch. It has a more neutral flavor than cornstarch and can be used at varying temperatures without losing its ability to thicken foods."

Bread has a mild flavor, so it shouldn't alter the taste of your stew. If your stew is still too watery, add more breadcrumbs or pieces of bread. However, too much can alter the flavor. You can use fresh, dried, or frozen bread crumbs. If you\u2019re using fresh bread, it\u2019s best to choose white bread."

          "headline":"Add mashed potatoes for a creamier broth.",
          "description":"For an easy option, remove potatoes from the stew and mash them. If you like a lot of potatoes in your stew, make a separate pot of mashed potatoes by boiling peeled potatoes, then mashing them. Add a dollop of mashed potatoes back to the stew. Stir the mashed potatoes into the stew, mixing it into the broth. Continue to add potatoes until the broth reaches your desired consistency. Another easy option is to sprinkle dried mashed potato flakes into the stew. Add the flakes in small amounts, stirring and checking the consistency until it reaches the thickness you prefer. Potatoes have a neutral taste and will not significantly alter the flavor of your stew."

However, don\u2019t add too much, as it may alter the flavor. Ground quick oats are your best option. How much you can add without altering the flavor will depend on how much stew you are making."

Cook the roux for 10 minutes, after which it should have a brownish-red color. Add small amounts of roux to the stew, stirring to combine. Continue to add roux to the stew until you reach your desired consistency. It\u2019s importantly to add the roux gradually to avoid having lumps in your stew. The roux should enhance the flavor of the stew. Vegetable oil can be substituted for the butter, if you prefer."

Bring the stew back to a boil so that the flour taste will dissipate. If necessary, add more paste until the stew reaches the thickness you desire. Flour can alter the taste of your stew, so use it sparingly. You may find the taste of the uncooked flour unpleasant. Don\u2019t add too much of the paste to your soup, as the flour could cause lumps. Similarly, you should add it slowly."

Although you can puree any part of your stew, root vegetables like carrots and potatoes are easiest. Pureeing is a great option for when you want to maintain the flavor of the soup and aren\u2019t worried about cutting down on solid ingredients. Be careful when handling the stew, as it will be very hot. You could get burned, especially while blending it. Move slowly, and use towels to handle the blender or food processor and its lid."
