      "headline":"Use Splash: If you have in your hands a rocket launcher or splash weapon, the best target is not the torso or the head; the best target is usually an enemies feet.",

      "headline":"Use Baseball: On rare occasions, a game may include a splash melee weapon.",
      "description":"In even rarer circumstances, that weapon may have a direct effect on projectile weapons. Let's face it, Halo 3 is the only forthcoming example, but don't forget about such an advantage. A rocket, grenade, or even a sword wielding enemy can be fouled by a properly timed hammer strike."

      "headline":"Use the Bouncer: For cripes sake, lead your enemy with grenades!",

      "headline":"Use the Tapper: When you have to fire a machine gun at long range or dual machine guns, it is often better to tap the trigger to maximize your damage.",

      "headline":"Clear Screen Tactics: Never underestimate the true value of a small weapon.",
      "description":"In short, smaller weapons allow for more view-able gaming area. For instance in Halo Two, one could argue that dual pistols allow a greater viewing area than the battle rifle, therefore adding advantage to a closer quarters battle."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use Screen Peeping: The best players are screen peepers, admitted or not.",
      "description":"This is due to two separate advantages. By looking at another player in split screen, you can identify your tactical advantage in reference to the other player. Also note that your peripheral vision is better at picking up movement; therefore, many screen peepers are able to play two screens at once and still easily win."

      "headline":"Understand Hierarchy: Very simply, have a firm understanding of the weapons that suck.",
      "description":"That may not be measured universally, but on your own skill and merit. Some are better snipers, some are better flak monkeys. Adjust your hierarchy as such."

      "headline":"Feign death: Some shooters allow you to feign death.",
      "description":"The irony is that most people do not know that. Map your controls and have that one handy. Lying on the ground with your tongue hanging out can have three effects. First, is that your enemy will walk right over you allowing you to easily shoot him in the back. Second, you will be accused of hacking or \"popping out of the floor.\" Third and most likely, if they do figure out what is going on, they will waste ammo on every corpse they come across. Giving you even more to laugh about."

      "headline":"Use Grenade Donkey Punch: Some shooters allow one to throw their opponent back with splash damage.",
      "description":"Whilst following an enemy, throw a grenade in front of them whilst running forward. The resulting blast should throw them backwards into your awaiting melee strike."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use Grenade Jumps: Although very common, grenade jumps are often misused.",
      "description":"When one is being \"lightly\" shot at from behind, a well placed grenade can, with practice, epically throw you over a wall or other impediment that places you out of the reach of your potential killer."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Control Sensitivity: It is a good practice to have your control sensitivity turned up very high.",
      "description":"This is for two reasons. One is to provide easy multi kills and draws against multiple opponents. The other advantage is to be able to address a potential killer to your rear. A person with low sensitivity would stand little or no chance in such a scenario. Get used to small jerky movements with your hands. A good tip with a mouse is to have your lower palm straddling the end of a table for leverage and quicker movements."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use Flag Armor: A good practice is slowly shoot your enemy when he has a flag.",
      "description":"In this, your objective is not to kill but to goad your enemy into seeking good defensive cover where you should then kill him. This is to give your teammates a decent position to defend the flag as it respawns."

    {
      "headline":"Sneak around: In some FPS, one team has objectives that can be captured.",
      "description":"They are assigned to defend these. If you happen to be the last person left that round, and there are several other enemies, some of who are camping, you might want to sneak past their lines. Do this by first firing wildly into the air, so the enemy knows you're there. Then, take the longest way to the objective as possible. The enemy, hungry for more blood, will attempt to take the shortest way to you to kill you and win the round. Thus, you will bypass the restless defenders, and it will be easier to win the round as last man standing."
