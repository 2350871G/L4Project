Keep a close eye on the weather forecast during the fall and be ready to move your begonia pots indoors when the evenings become chilly. For overnight storage on a chilly evening, simply move the pots to a garage or basement that stays above 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). If your begonias are planted directly in the soil, your only recourse is to loosen the soil around the root ball, pull out the entire root ball and attached soil, and move each begonia to an individual pot filled with nutrient-rich potting mix."
