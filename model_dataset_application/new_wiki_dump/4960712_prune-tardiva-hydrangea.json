          "description":"If you are growing your Tardiva hydrangeas in a tree formation, you should be careful not to remove any of the plant's upper limbs or the main trunks that contribute to the plant's particular shape. By pruning the base, your plant will grow much larger at its top rather than its base, contributing to a tree-like look. This is because the hydrangea will grow several feet taller before it produces blossoms, giving it time to gain height relative to its width. However, if you want to reduce your plant to a shrub, then go ahead and prune these upper branches and the hydrangea will revert to its naturally shrubby state."

Cut one-third of the oldest stems right off at the base in winter or early spring each year for three consecutive years. The height of the remaining stems can be reduced by one-third each year as well to help reduce the overall size of the shrub. In the fourth year, most of the stems will be new and the shrub will be full-looking."
