          "description":"Swap \u00bc of a medium avocado into your morning smoothie in place of a banana. It adds a rich, creamy texture to your drink and reduces the total amount of sugar. If you miss the sweetness of the banana, add a teaspoon (7 g) of honey to your avocado smoothie. Blend \u00be cup (170 g) of grapefruit, 1 cup (30 g) of spinach, \u00bc of a medium avocado, 2 scoops of protein powder, \u00be cup  (176 ml) of cold green tea, and 1 teaspoon of honey (7 g) in a blender for a delicious smoothie."

Fold \u00bd cup (75 g) of sunflower seeds, \u00bc cup (100 g) of cocoa powder, \u00bd cup (30 g) of shredded coconut, and \u00bc cup (40 g) of chia seeds into the mixture. Spoon the mixture into an 8 in x 8 in (20.32 cm x 20.23 cm) greased, lined baking pan, pressing it down with your hands. Refrigerate the mixture until firm and then cut it into rectangular bars. These bars are great for a healthy breakfast on the go when you don\u2019t have a lot of time. These bars should take about 2 hours to firm up in the refrigerator."

          "headline":"Make avocado-banana pancakes.",
          "description":"Use a 1:1 ratio of avocado to banana to make a healthier version of your favorite banana pancakes. Mash the avocado and banana together, and use the fruit mash in place of the mashed banana. The result is a subtle, creamy pancake that has less sugar, so you can use more maple syrup guilt-free! For an extra dose of fruit, add sliced bananas and diced avocados on top of the pancakes. For example, if your pancakes call for 2 cups of mashed bananas (600 g), use 1 cup of mashed bananas (300 g) and 1 cup of mashed avocado (300 g) instead. For a delicious pancake batter, mix 2/3 cup (85 g) of whole grain flour, \u00bd cup (64 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon (13 g) of brown sugar, 2 teaspoons (8 g) of baking powder, 1 ripe mashed avocado, 3 bananas, 1 cup (235 ml) of milk, 2 large eggs, and a splash of vanilla extract. Pour your pancakes into a greased pan, flipping each after about 2 minutes. Enjoy!"

You\u2019ll reduce the amount of saturated fat and gain additional vitamins and minerals. For example, if your recipe calls for 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter, use 2 tablespoons (28 g) of mashed avocado instead. Reduce your oven temperature by about 25% when substituting avocado. The substitution will also likely increase baking times. Check your goods when they would normally be ready. If they\u2019re not finished, check them again at 2 minute intervals until they are done."
