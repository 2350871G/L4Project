          "description":"Many video games can take upwards of 100 hours to complete. However, most publications expect a review within 1 week of the game being released. Try to play the video game that you are reviewing for at least 7 hours to get a feel for it. Explore as much of the game as you can in this timeframe. If the game has different levels, try to level up as many times as possible. If the game is an open world, explore as much of it as you can."

          "headline":"Take notes on what you appreciate about the game.",
          "description":"Your notes will translate directly into what you put in your review. Use a computer or a notebook to write down what you like about the game. Pay attention to playability, sound, graphics, and in-game purchases. Jot down anything that sticks out to you, even if it is small. Details as small as the trees waving in the wind or a character\u2019s headband can help a reader envision the in-game world when they read your review."

          "description":"Not every game is perfect, and your review should focus on the improvements that you think could be made as well as the positives. Take note of what you didn\u2019t love about the game. Maybe the graphics are clunky, or the load times are too long. If anything annoys you even slightly, be sure to write it down.Tip: Try to be specific. Instead of writing \u201cThe main character sucks!\u201d try, \u201cThe main character didn\u2019t have as many weapon options as I would have liked.\u201d This will be helpful when you start writing."

Think about games that are in the same genre as the one you are playing. Is it an action-based game? A horror game? A racing one? Then, think about which ones you liked better or worse. Would you play this one more or less than other games? For example, you could say, \u201cThis racing game has more car model options, but less customizable pieces than their last release.\u201d"

Indie games or mobile apps can be on the lower end, while popular games should be more in-depth and closer to 1,000 words.Tip: If you are publishing a video game review on your own website or blog, you can choose your word count.

Introduce the game that you are reviewing without giving away too much about the story itself. Open with a hook to grab your readers\u2019 attention and make them want to read the rest of your review. For example, say something like, \u201cAfter the success of Injustice, the newest game from the NetherRealm Studios is Mortal Kombat X. With this installment in the MK series, Nether Realm has mended all the shortcomings that Injustice had and added so much more. MK X is by far the best MK game we have seen in the series.\u201d"

For example, \u201cThe movements of the characters and flair with which the executions and bonus moves are performed are one of the best we\u2019ve ever seen.

For example, \u201cThis game breathes fresh air into the market by offering characters who each have a different playing style, offering you the opportunity to learn the combo moves of each character.\u201d"

You can give it a numerical rating if you\u2019d like to make it easy to understand. For example, \u201cI certainly advise you to go pick yourself up a copy of this game.
