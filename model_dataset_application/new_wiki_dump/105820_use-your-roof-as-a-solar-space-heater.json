  "text":" Access the roof space of your house and make sure that your roof has an insulation membrane under the roofing sheets.  Locate the top two purlins either side of the roof ridge  Now tidy up any excess insulation. Use a hand tacker staple gun to neatly secure the insulation to the purlins along the whole length of the ridge. When finished each side of the roof should now have insulation running from the gutter to the height of the top purlin.The space between the purlin should be open to the underside of the metal forming the ridge.  Cut strips of insulation wide enough to fix across the underside of the top two purlins and long enough to run the length of the ridge.  Fix this insulation to the underside of the top two purlins with your hand tacker, thus forming a header between them. The air between the roof sheeting and the insulation will be heated by the radiation of the sun.It will rise toward this header and collect there. Near the center of the ridge fit a suitably sized duct outlet. ( if you intend to use a six inch ducted fan then you should use a matching 6 inch duct) Fix it to the underside of the purlins. Seal to the foil using silicone or similar product , making sure that the portion of foil directly under outlet is removed to allow the heated air to flow from the duct. Fit a ceiling duct outlet to the ceiling of the area you wish to heat.  Fit a suitably sized ducted fan somewhere between the duct from the ridge and the duct to the ceiling.Best practice would entail suspending the fan from the roof structure using a heavy duty spring .

Measure cut and fit two lengths of foil ducting.One to connect your ridge duct to the fan and one to connect the fan to the ceiling duct.  Fit a thermostatic switch near the duct at the header and position the sensor bulb inside the header near the duct opening. Secure the bulb to the purlin.
