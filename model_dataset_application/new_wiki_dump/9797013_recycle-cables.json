All you have to do is box up whatever cords and cables you no longer have a use for. The attendants will sort, inventory, and prepare them for processing. Check the community events section of your local newspaper to learn when and where e-waste collection events are happening near you. Generally, any device or accessory containing materials like lead, cadmium, beryllium, or brominated cyclic hydrocarbons that may be harmful to the environment falls into the category of e-waste."

Copper, in particular, is very valuable\u2014in many markets, it can go for as much as $3 per pound. Contact your local scrapyard or metal recycling center and ask about their criteria for accepting salvage metals. Some dealers are happy to handle the extraction process themselves, while others may expect you to have the raw materials ready before you bring them in. Be aware that copper theft is a felony offense. The only time you should attempt to mine raw copper for sale is when it comes from an electronic component that you purchased legally."
