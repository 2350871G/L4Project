          "description":"Since collecting gemstones is such a versatile hobby, there may be some differences in design when people first begin to collect gemstones. It\u2019s important to know what you want out of collecting before you begin to collect. For most people, this will simply be a choice between collecting for fun or attempting to collect as a source of investment. If you\u2019re choosing to collect as an investment, know ahead of time how much time and money you\u2019re willing to spend. Those will be the factors which most influence your collecting. If you\u2019re collecting out of interest, then collecting will be a matter of choosing what you like best. You might consider centering your starting collection around a certain theme, like color or location of origin."

Unless you\u2019re lucky most locations with public digs will require a bit of a trip, so plan ahead if you\u2019re hoping to visit a dig site. Those who are collecting as an investment will want to stay away from public digs. Gemstones worth investing in will need to be considerably more rare than those found at public dig sites. Also, those who are looking to collect especially exotic or scarce gemstones may want to look elsewhere. Public digs will usually only involve more common gemstones, such as emeralds, sapphires, and diamonds. To find dig sites, look online. Alternatively, you can seek out local geological/gemological societies and organizations for any recommendations. Prepare for anything when it comes to these public digs. Some are sheltered and have you sitting and sifting, others have you entering caves with full equipment."

          "description":"Certainly a perk for the gem enthusiast, collecting gems will require you to possess or begin to possess a familiarity with gemstones. Even the shrewd investment collector will prefer to be able to at least somewhat identify gemstones they see in person. Identifying gemstones will require some equipment: tweezers, a loupe (glass eye, usually with 10x magnification), and some light source. More advanced identifying techniques may require a refractometer or polariscope. This is why it is always a good idea to form a good relationship with a dealer; a friendly dealer may lend their expertise and equipment when you\u2019ve got something that needs identifying. Fortunately the most basic assessments can be done with the naked eye by examining the gem\u2019s color by analyzing its hue (base color), tone (depth of color), and saturation (strength of color)."

          "description":"Though only a serious concern for investment collectors, it\u2019s never a poor choice to decide what you\u2019d like to purchase ahead of time. Of course what you choose to buy will ultimately be decided by how much you\u2019re willing to spend; this is something that, mentioned previously, is also helpful to know ahead of time. Collectibility (and value) in gemstones is almost always decided by rarity. While rarity may not always mean expensive to purchase, rarity will mean consistency of value--gems which are rare now will only become more rare. In that vein, gemstones you\u2019ll want to look for if you\u2019re an investor are those which are especially rare in occurrence, or more common gems with uncommon traits (such as \u201cunheated\u201d gems or unusual colors like yellow sapphire). Again, don\u2019t purchase the most expensive gems you can find in the hopes of them being more expensive later on. The gem market is unusually receptive to short-lived trends, and certain gems may receive artificial price boosts which fail to last."

          "description":"As one might imagine, a growing number of gem dealers are expanding or altogether moving their operations online. The most important thing to be aware of when shopping online (for gems or anything else) is to be aware of anything that looks illegitimate or untrustworthy. Normally you\u2019ll want sites that have a good selection, as well as a photograph along with everything they sell. Never buy from a site which doesn\u2019t allow returns; too often you\u2019ll find gems in-person won\u2019t match their online photographs. While there are a host of legitimate sites online, a few reputable choices with broad selections are: http://www.multicolour.com/, http://www.palagems.com/, and http://www.thechinastone.com/. It\u2019s not a bad idea to choose a few sites to build a lasting relationship with; it often becomes easier to do business with dealers that know you better."

If you\u2019re fortunate you may have a gem collector\u2019s shop in your own town. While these rarely contain a large selection for sale, they are a good base for trade talk and advice. The most reliable and active scene for purchasing gems in person will be trade fairs. Usually traveling or part of temporary flea markets, these are usually groups of several vendors looking to sell. Be aware that there\u2019s often a culture of haggling at these gatherings; be prepared to have to talk some prices down. Like online stores, it helps to build relationships with any dealers you find reliable, especially if you\u2019re looking for certain gems in particular. A good dealer can provide insight into the smaller gem mining/processing community."

Far from suggesting anything illegitimate, hobby collectors should consider other avenues, such as informal online trading, for their gem purchases. Since hobby collectors generally have specific stones in mind which might not fall in the rare or expensive category, casting a wider net can be very helpful. If you have a specific gemstone in mind, don\u2019t hesitate to try and reach out to others on Craigslist or gemstone collecting forums online. Plenty of communities will already have an ad-hoc trading environment set up. Trade fairs will also have a fair amount for hobby collectors to appreciate.
