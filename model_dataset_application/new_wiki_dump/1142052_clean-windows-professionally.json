Always start the job with a clean scrubber or lamb\u2019s wool applicator. Scraper blades are changed at the beginning of each day. Every job also gets a fresh clean bucket of soapy water. Last but not least are two lint free towels. One will be used to dry your squeegee after each pull and the other is for your final detailing of the corners and window sills."
