          "description":"Brussels sprouts have a relatively long growing season, and growers will harvest them over about a 6- or 7-month window. So, if you live in North America or Europe, you can find fresh Brussels sprouts between September and March. Major grocery stores may stock Brussels sprouts year round. However, if you purchase sprouts out of season (in summer), they\u2019re more likely to be flavorless."

          "description":"Brussels sprouts grow on a long stalk, although they'll usually have been plucked off of the stalk by the time they reach your produce aisle. However, if you do manage to find a stalk with sprouts on it, these sprouts will be richer in flavor and will also keep longer in your fridge. You\u2019re more likely to find Brussels sprouts still on the stalk at a local farmers market or co-op."

          "description":"Sprouts that were on the vine for at least 1 winter frost will be sweeter than those harvested prior to the frost. If you\u2019re buying sprouts at a farmers market and you can speak with the farmer who harvested the sprouts, ask at what point in the season they made the harvest. If you\u2019re purchasing Brussels sprouts at a large grocery store, the produce venders may not know whether or not the sprouts were harvested after a frost."

          "description":"A bright green color indicates that the sprouts are young, healthy, and have plenty of flavor. Avoid purchasing any sprouts with yellowed leaves. If you see mostly yellowing sprouts, you\u2019re looking through a batch of old and no longer fresh sprouts. It\u2019s okay to use yellowing sprouts in dishes like a stew or casserole. The sprouts\u2019s age and texture won\u2019t matter as much in these dishes, since they\u2019ll be cooked and blended with other ingredients."

          "description":"As Brussels sprouts begin to age, their overlapping leaves will begin to loosen. Older sprouts will have less flavor and will go bad more quickly in your fridge. So, only purchase firm, tightly-closed sprouts. Test the sprouts\u2019 age by feeling them. A quick 2-finger squeeze will tell you if the sprouts are young. Sprouts should feel firm and have little give when you squeeze them."

          "description":"As with the majority of fruits and vegetables, smaller sprouts have a sweet, pleasant flavor. Look through the Brussels sprouts bin until you find a few that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. Larger sprouts will have a tougher consistency and will be largely flavorless."

          "headline":"Find sprouts of a uniform size without lumps or blemishes.",
          "description":"If you find a lumpy, uneven Brussels sprout, put it back in the grocery store bin. Uneven sprouts will cook unevenly, leaving you with sprouts that are fully cooked in parts and still raw in others. Also avoid selecting sprouts with black or brown patches or that have been eaten by insects. The sprouts that you select don\u2019t need to be completely symmetrical, but every side of the sprout should be proportionate to the other sides."

So, break off the individual sprouts before storing them. Throw away or compost the stem.

The less air you leave in the bag, the slower the sprouts will go bad. If you\u2019re using a container, you just need to put on the lid and seal it shut.
