Generic potted plants and flowers with muted colors, like lily whites and carnations, go well with most walls. For a more striking niche display, try flowers like roses, camellias, and dahlias."

For small niches, try showing off busts, action figures, collectibles, signed objects, and other items that are either visually striking or personally meaningful. For large niches, go with paintings, posters, statues, 3D art, and similarly stunning, grandiose objects."

Since wall letters are customizable, you can decorate them however you wish and arrange them in any order. Some simple design ideas include:\nThe names of your friends and family members. Your family motto. An inspirational quote."

Though not always practical for small wall compartments, large niches provide ample room for a variety of objects. Try:\nAttaching hooks to the wall, creating a spot for keys, coats, and other items. Installing shelves in your niche, turning it into a bookshelf or something similar. Placing lightweight drawers in the niche, converting it into a supply area."

Thankfully, a simple mirror can usually fix the problem, creating the illusion of space and depth. Mirrors go particularly well with bathroom and bedroom niches, often serving as makeup or wardrobe aids."

Because they're typically made with tile, these wall compartments work well with soap, hand sanitizer, lotion, and similar messy substances. Some other design ideas include:\nTurning the niche into a towel holder. Using the wall compartment as a medicine container. Giving guests a spot to place their rings."

If you build fires often, the easiest way to decorate this wall compartment may be by simply filling it with lumber you intend to burn. Not only is this decor incredibly functional, but it will create a warm, natural aesthetic perfect for the winter. To avoid damaging the niche, place a sheet of cloth underneath the firewood."

If this is the case, try adding accent lights to your wall compartment. Most people install small, low-watt spotlights inside their niche's ceiling, similar to a museum display. However, you can also install accent lights by:\nGluing a LED strip along the edges of the niche. Placing a tap light inside the niche. Pointing external spotlights at the niche."

Wired via a hole in the niche's ceiling, these lamps hang down and take up a large amount of space, pulling people's eyes to the area. Depending on your desired aesthetic, try going with a sleek, modern lamp or a more elegant fixture reminiscent of a chandelier."

Large, tall candles will create an elegant look reminiscent of religious services and holidays. Small tea lights will create a more romantic display, bathing the area in warm light."
