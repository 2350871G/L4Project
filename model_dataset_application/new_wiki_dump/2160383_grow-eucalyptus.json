Though eucalyptus grows more successfully from a seed, it can be propagated from a cutting, too. Take a 4- to 6-inch cutting and plant it in a small pot filled with perlite or potting soil. Keep this substrate most and regularly mist the cutting. Place it in a warm area with good sunlight and let your tree grow!"
