Ceiling fans are often the most effective way to cool down a room, while stationary and tower fans are usually cheaper to purchase. Determine how large you want the fan to be and how it blends in with your existing decor. If you don't have a lot of space, you could purchase a smaller desk fan. If you need to cool multiple people, you should consider purchasing an oscillating fan. Stationary fans can come in the form of box fans, table fans, and tower fans. You can purchase a stationary fan at most department stores or online."

Look on the product detail sheet or the packaging of a stationary or window unit to make sure that it\u2019s optimized for the size of the room you want to cool. Then, once you have air conditioning, turn down the thermostat to reduce the temperature of the room. Air conditioning is the easiest but least energy efficient way to cool a room.
