The slotted kind of ribbon yarn has edging that is made up of rectangular slots made from string. If you are working with this type of ribbon yarn, then you will be knitting into the slots only and not using the entire ribbon. The regular type of ribbon yarn just looks like a long length of ribbon. To work with this yarn, you can knit it as usual."

Knitting into every other slot will help to ensure that your finished project has a ruffled look to it. If your ribbon yarn does not have slots, then just knit with it as usual. However, you may want to double wrap your yarn around the needle for your stitches in every other row. Then, unfurl the yarn in the next row to enhance the ribbon-effect of the yarn."
