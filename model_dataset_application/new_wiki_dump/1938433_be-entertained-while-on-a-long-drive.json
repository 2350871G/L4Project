          "description":"While your taste in music has probably changed since you were a kid, you may still have those old CDs stashed somewhere. A long drive can be a great time for a walk down memory lane. Grab a handful of CDs you haven\u2019t listened to in years and see if you can still sing along to all of the words. You can also take some of your current favorites, borrow new music from a friend, or check out something random from the library. If you prefer an MP3 player over CDs, consider playing it on shuffle and see if you are surprised by some of the music you forgot you had on there. When travelling with kids, bring some CDs of silly songs kids like to sing along to. Or if they are older, let them play some of the music they like."

          "description":"If you love to read, you probably have that one book you know you should read but have been avoiding. A long trip can be a great time to listen to an audiobook, especially of a book you can\u2019t make yourself read. You get to experience the story without the potential boredom of hours of reading. Most public libraries have a large assortment of audiobooks on CD, which you could check out. You can also download from sites like Audible. Some libraries may even have digital audiobooks for streaming or download. There are all kinds of audiobooks that are kid-friendly, so consider finding a story kids and adults both could enjoy. You don\u2019t have to just choose a difficult book. You could check out the latest best-seller or something a friend has recommended that you\u2019ve put off for too long already."

Podcasts often have celebrity interviews but can also be done by people who are not otherwise famous. Searching in iTunes or the Google Play Store will give you nearly unlimited options. You can download podcasts that discuss the latest in sports, music podcasts that include full songs or clips, or serialized podcasts that tell a narrative in each episode. If you have a hobby or interest, there is most likely a podcast that will suit your taste."

You might assume that radio is basically the same everywhere, but you might be surprised by what you find being played. Even if you don\u2019t settle on a station, or if none have good enough reception, it\u2019s a fun way to take a break from whatever else you\u2019re listening to."

You can try working together to follow a logical pattern, or some players may think of something crazy to challenge the person after them. The idea is to think quickly and keep the story moving, so have a reasonable time limit on how long each player gets to say their sentence. If you play multiple times, rotate who starts the story, or let people jump in with their sentence in a random order. This is a great game for kids because they can make the story extra silly. It gives them a chance to engage their minds when the drive gets boring."

Take the list with you, maybe even a copy for each passenger, and mark things off as you see them. You can even have a disposable camera with you to take pictures as you see the thing. If you have time, you can stop and stand by the things for the picture. Examples might be a round barn, a windmill, a rock formation, an RV, animals, towns in other states with the same name as your hometown, or a courthouse. You can come up with wild things that you\u2019d never expect like a lion or a robot. You can make the items as general or specific as you want. For example you might say \u201ca cow\u201d or you might say \u201ca brown cow.\u201d You could say \u201ca park\u201d or \u201ca park with a playground.\u201d This makes some items harder to find. You could also put the items on a bingo grid and have everyone try to get bingo with the items. If kids are playing, the prize for getting the most items or a bingo might be letting them pick the restaurant when you stop to eat. Or you could have an actual prize for them like a candy bar or a small toy."

You can adjust the rules, as you wish. You can make it any car you see and play for a certain time limit. Or you can make it only cars that pass you.

If you don\u2019t mind taking a longer drive, consider using smaller roads that offer more scenery. You may drive a bit farther and take longer, but the drive will be more enjoyable than faster routes. This is probably best done if you are a very good navigator or have GPS handy so that you make sure you still get where you are going without getting lost. You don\u2019t want to get stuck on back country roads with no idea how to get back to the highway. If you have kids who are old enough to read a map, you can let them choose the route you take.

Almost anywhere you drive will have something interesting you can stop and look at. This doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be completely spontaneous. You could look ahead at your basic route and see if there is anything interesting to stop and see along the way.

You can always ask the standard questions like what they do for work, what they are studying if they\u2019re in college, or what their hobbies are. When you want to dig a little deeper, you can ask them what social issues they care about, what they would do with their time if they didn\u2019t have to work, or just ask them to tell a story about something that happened to them in the past. You can ask kids a lot of different questions to keep them entertained. Ask what kind of jobs they might enjoy someday. Ask what places they would like to travel when they have the chance. You can often keep kids talking for a while without too much work."
