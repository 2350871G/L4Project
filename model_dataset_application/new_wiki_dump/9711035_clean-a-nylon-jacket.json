Apply the detergent solution to the stain on the nylon, and allow the solution to sit for 15 minutes. Using a different clean, wet cloth, wipe the detergent from the stain. Use a dry cloth to blot the remaining moisture from the spot. The newer the stain is, the easier it will be to remove. Try to remove food or drink stains as soon as you notice them."

Next, in a ventilated space, spray a high-grade cleaning solvent such as Simple Green, some dish soap, or a stain remover such as Shout onto some paper towels and then dab at the stained area until the stain is gone. Wipe the area dry with some dry paper towels. Do not apply cleaning solvents directly to the nylon. Lightly spray paper towels with solvent and gently dab those onto the jacket. Wear gloves while working with cleaning solvents."
