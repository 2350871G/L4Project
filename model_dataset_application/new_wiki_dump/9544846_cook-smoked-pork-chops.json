  "text":" Cooking Smoked Pork Chops on the Stovetop Heat 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of cooking oil in a large pan. Turn the burner under the pan to medium-high heat. Wait for the oil to start smoking so you know it's hot enough. Cook the smoked pork chops in the pan for 2 minutes on each side. After 4 minutes, both sides of the pork chops should be browned. Lower the heat and cook the pork chops for 1 minute. After 1 minute, check the temperature of the pork chops with a meat thermometer. The pork chops need to be at least 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) for them to be safe to eat. If they\u2019re not, cook them for 1-2 more minutes on the stovetop. Transfer the pork chops to a plate and serve. Be careful of the hot oil in the pan when you\u2019re moving the pork chops. Let the pork chops cool for a few minutes before serving. Grilling Smoked Pork Chops Turn on your grill and set it to medium-high heat. Make sure the grill grates are clean before you put the smoked pork chops on them. Brush the grill grates with vegetable oil. This will keep the pork chops from sticking to the grates. Brush the oil on using a basting brush. If you don't have vegetable oil, use a different cooking oil, like olive oil, instead. Cook the smoked pork chops on the grill for 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, the bottom sides of the pork chops should be browned. Rotate the pork chops 90-degrees and cook them for 2 more minutes. Rotating the pork chops will give them diamond grill marks. If you don\u2019t want the pork chops to have diamond grill marks, you can leave them as they are and let them cook for 2 more minutes. Flip the pork chops and cook them for 2 more minutes. After the 2 minutes, check the temperature of the pork chops with a meat thermometer. If the pork chops aren\u2019t at least 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C), they\u2019re not safe to eat.

Roasting Smoked Pork Chops Preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Move the oven rack to the middle if it\u2019s not already there. Brown one side of the smoked pork chops in a pan over medium-high heat. It should take about 3-4 minutes for the pork chops to fully brown on one side. If the pork chops start to smoke, turn down the heat on the burner. Transfer the pork chops to a baking pan so the browned side is face up. Don't worry about lining or greasing the baking pan. Roast the pork chops in the oven for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the pork chops. You want the pork chops to be at least 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) or they won\u2019t be safe to eat.
