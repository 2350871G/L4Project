          "description":"Trading attempts is when you put an item on trade and see what people offer you for it, but you don't accept any trades yet. When the majority of people trade you the same amount of rarity for your item, you will know that that is what your item is worth. Go to a populated den or server, put your item on trade, and keep doing trading attempts for it until you see a majority of people trading you the same amount of rarity for it. This technique is useful because whenever you're not sure if an item has gone up or down, you can always see what most of the people trade you to find out. Be aware that most Jammers undertrade, or try to trade a bit less than what an item is worth to make a profit. Once you get your most common trade value, bring it up a tiny bit so you can be more accurate. For example, a Rare Item Monday Headdress is worth 2 black long Spiked Collars, but most people will only trade one black long Spiked Collar and a red long Spiked Collar."

Then trade a black long and a red long to another person with an RIM headdress. They may tell you to add as well. If several people tell you to add, that means your trade is under. Once you add, and they are willing to accept, check if many people are willing to accept that trade. If they are, then you know your offer is the worth of that item that you have and are also trading for. Make sure to do this with a lot of people so that you know if you're correct or not. Some people will tell you to add even if your offer is fair. Don't actually accept any trades in this process unless you are sure you know what the worth of the item is. Or, you don't have to accept any trades at all if you just wanted to discover the worth of your item. This technique may be a bit complicated if you don't have a lot of very rare items. However, it can still work for smaller rares, such as den betas that include wood floors, tan carpets, etc."
