If you catch a diseased portion before it spreads throughout the whole plant, you can save a cactus from being completely destroyed.

If the plant becomes disproportionate or is beginning to bend and break due to the weight of overgrowth, pruning the cactus back can help to bring things back to a more balanced state. Look for leaning sections that might even have clear breaks in the plant to determine if overgrowth is occurring. Sometimes a plant has simply grown too tall or wide for its setting.

Padded and prickly pear style cacti usually can be pruned with smaller pruning shears or garden clippers. The larger columnar cacti will more likely need a saw. Tools should be cleaned with soap and warm water, or if they have been used on diseased plant material already, use \u00bc cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water. Select heavier clothing that will not only cover as much skin as possible but will also prevent the cactus spines from penetrating the cloth and hurting you. Since you will be working with your hands, leather gloves are perhaps the most important component to keeping yourself from getting pricked. You may also wish to tape your sleeve cuffs over your gloves to prevent spines from falling up into your sleeve. The same can be done with pant cuffs at your ankle in case you are walking into a denser section of cacti to prune."
