While you can have a professional install the filter, they\u2019re relatively easy to install over the course of an afternoon. You\u2019ll need to assemble the filter mechanisms, and hook the system\u2019s hoses up to your tap beneath your kitchen sink. Many filtration systems also come with a small faucet that you\u2019ll need to install, typically by removing the side sprayer. Filtration systems should be available at the majority of larger hardware stores, or also at home-supply stores."

The filters themselves are cylindrical units, about 12 inches (30 cm) high, with a 3 inch (7.6 cm) diameter. You should be able to purchase them separately at the same store where you initially bought the RO system."

          "description":"RO filters are effective; they remove up to 95% of the fluoride from drinking water by forcing the water through a series of permeable membranes that removes fluoride and other contaminants. However, RO systems go through a lot of water: an RO filter needs 3 or 4 gallons (11.4 or 15.1 L) (11 or 15 L) of tap water to produce 1 gallon (3.8 L) (3.7 L) of filtered water. Because of the system\u2019s slow filtration rate and the ratio of unfiltered water to filtered water, they\u2019re often seen as being inefficient."

If you live alone, or have only a couple of people in your family, an RO system may be an unaffordable option. If you\u2019re set on an RO filter, however, there are cheaper options available. For example, the iSpring 75GPD 5-Stage Filter can be purchased for just under $200. More expensive RO filter options will be able to filter and store larger amounts of water, and will likely filter water more quickly than cheaper and smaller filters."

These minerals can benefit your health, and also give tap water some of its pleasant taste. RO-filtered water often has a \u201cflat\u201d or lifeless taste. That said, you can also purchase mineral and salt drops to \u201cremineralize\u201d water that has gone through an RO filter. These drops can be found at health-food stores or at various online retailers. \u201cHard\u201d (mineral-filled) water or highly contaminated water will both reduce the lifespan of the RO system\u2019s filters. However, you can purchase replacement filters for the RO system. These filters typically have a threaded base that can simply be unscrewed from the RO system base, once you\u2019ve turned off water to the kitchen sink. The new filter can then be screwed back in place. You do not need to call a professional to replace your filters."
