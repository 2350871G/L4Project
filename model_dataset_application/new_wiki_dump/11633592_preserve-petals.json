Check that the flowers you choose have clean, unblemished petals. Preserving petals is a great way to save or recycle a bouquet of flowers. However, you can also harvest your own flowers from outside.Tip: If you're cutting or picking flowers from outside, wait until the flowers are dry to harvest them. This will cut down on your drying time."

Otherwise, you may accidentally absorb or ingest unwanted chemicals. For instance, you might look for organic flowers. If you want to use dried flowers in recipes often, consider growing your own flowers."

Leave the petals to dry for 2 weeks, turning them daily to ensure they dry evenly. Pick a window that isn't near an air conditioning vent or fan, as moving air could blow the petals away. The petals will shrink and curl up as they dry."

          "description":"Arrange the flower petals in a single layer on a sheet of wax paper. Cover the petals with a second sheet of wax paper. Open the book at the approximate center and carefully lay the wax sheets containing the petals over one side of the book. Close the book over the wax paper and stack 2-3 more books on top. Wait 1 month for your petals to dry out. You can also use plain paper if you don\u2019t have wax paper. However, sometimes the moisture from the petals soaks through plain paper and may stain your book pages. Pressing your petals creates prettier petals because they'll have flat edges and won't look shriveled."

Position the hairspray about 6 in (15 cm) away from the flowers and spray a light, even coat of hairspray onto the petals. Let the hairspray dry for 10 minutes, then display or store your flowers. Aerosol hairspray works best for preserving flower petals because the bottle makes it easier to apply an even layer of hairspray."

          "description":"Put a .5 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) layer of silica gel in a clean air-tight container. Place a single layer of flower petals over the silica gel, then add another .5 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) of silica gel. Secure the lid on the container and let it sit for 2-3 days. Check them to see if they're dry. If they're not dry after 2-3 days, let them sit for another 2 days, then check them again. They will dry out within 2 weeks, usually sooner. Silica gel is a porous form of silicon dioxide that absorbs moisture. It looks like tiny blue or clear beads. You can purchase it at a craft supply store, big box store, or online. You can reuse silica gel until it turns pink, which means it's lost all moisture."

Allow your petals to dry for 4 hours, then check to see if they are done. Rotate the trays every hour to help the petals dry evenly. If the petals aren't fully dehydrated after 4 hours, leave them in the dehydrator for another hour before checking them again. Continue to check the petals every hour until they are fully dry. It will likely take 6-8 hours for the petals to dry out."
