For example, ISO 400, shutter 400, f 16 (sunny 16) = ISO 400, shutter 800, f 11. Also equal to ISO 400, shutter 200, f 22. What you're doing is bring shutter one stop up (halve the speed, i.e. double the exposure duration from one 400th to one 200th of a second) and the aperture one stop down (halve the area of the opening)\nMost lenses do not have f 0.5. And only expensive lenses even have 1.4 and f 2. In a way, those values can be considered hypothetical. So, for example you have film with ISO 400, and you are shooting a not very brightly lit room. According to the above, f=0.5. say your widest aperture (lowest stop) is f4. there are 6 stops from f4 to f 0.5 (2.8, 2, 1.4, 1, 0.7, 0.5). Therefore, you need to reduce the speed 6 stops from 400 to 6 : 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6. You probably need a tripod, because this is 1/6th of a second and the picture will be blurry due to handshake."
