Most British breakfast tea blends are made from black tea."

However, many people prefer tea bags because they\u2019re easier to use and don\u2019t require an infuser.

Otherwise, wait until you see large bubbles rising quickly to the surface of the water. You can also use an electric kettle to boil water.
