          "description":"You'll need: 3 cups packed fresh basil, 1/4 cup pine nuts, 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1/2 cup Italian cheese (Parmesan, Romano, etc. ), 2 cloves of garlic (depending on taste) and salt and pepper to taste. Spread the pine nuts on a baking sheet and toast until golden brown. Place the pine nuts underneath a broiler until golden brown or simply bake in a 400 degree Fahrenheit oven for 5-10 minutes, checking often. Alternatively, toast the pine nuts in a pan over low or medium-low heat on a burner. Stir often. Pine nuts burn very easily, making them somewhat finicky to work with. When toasting pine nuts, pay attention closely and move them around often. The difference between perfectly toasted pine nuts and burnt pine nuts is often a matter of seconds. Chop the garlic, cheese, and nuts (optional). Chopping before they are put into the food processor makes a finer ground pesto in the end. Add the chopped ingredients and basil into a food processor. Add the extra virgin olive oil in the spout gradually as the food is being processed. If you don't have a food processor, you can also use a blender in a pinch. (Pesto will turn out finer and less grainy when using a food processor.) Add salt and pepper to taste. Give the food processor one or two more pulses. It's now ready to use on pasta, salad, or bread."

Shock the basil. Drain and rinse them under cold water immediately. By doing this, you will stop any cooking. Use paper towels to dry the basil. Add the basil leaves to a blender. Puree the basil while slowly dripping the olive oil in. Puree until you get a smooth texture. Store the basil oil in an airtight container. Use within 3 days."

Knead with the back of a wooden spoon. Add the chopped basil to the butter. Blend through with the wooden spoon. Lay out wax paper on the work surface. Place the blended basil butter onto the paper. Roll into a sausage shape. Sprinkle with more chopped basil. Roll the wax paper around the butter log. Place into the butter log in the refrigerator to chill. Serve.
