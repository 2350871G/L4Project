It's true that some famous artists have illegible signatures, but they can get away with it because a lot of people in the art world are familiar with them. If your signature is illegible, future owners of your painting will have a hard time finding out who you are. Practice signing a legible signature on a piece of paper. Then, show a few friends and ask if they can read it. If they can\u2019t, work on making it easier to read."
