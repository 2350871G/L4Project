      "description":"The first step to using a Fatality in Mortal Kombat is to read up on the move lists of the character you are currently playing as. All characters have different Fatalities and move lists. You can access move lists and Fatality information about the character you are currently using by pressing \u201cStart\u201d on the Xbox One, pressing \u201cOptions\u201d on the PlayStation 4 or by pressing \u201cEsc\u201d on the PC. Navigate to the \u201cMove List\u201d option and press A for Xbox One, X for PS4, or Enter/right mouse click on PC. Go to the \u201cFinishing Moves\u201d listing to the far right by using your joystick, D-pad, or arrow keys. Pick out a finishing move on this page, and memorize the combo listed for the finishing move you have picked or write it down for later reference. You will need to repeat this combo with your controller, keyboard, or gamepad after you have defeated your enemy to use a Fatality. Think of it like an old-school cheat code combination."

      "description":"If you do not kill your opponent, you will not be able to perform your Fatality, so use what you\u2019ve learned so far to take out your enemy. You cannot perform a fatality until the end of the winning round.

      "headline":"Initiate your Fatality.",
      "description":"Once your opponent\u2019s health has been brought down to zero and their health bar is displayed as empty, they will stand there in a dazed state. At this point, you can initiate your Fatality. Refer to the combo you wrote down earlier and input this combo with your controller, keyboard, or gamepad. Sometimes completing a Fatality combo can be quite difficult due to the wide combination of buttons that must be pressed in quick succession. You can practice initiating a Fatality every time you beat an opponent, but it will take a good few hours of play before a new player will feel confident enough to successfully complete a Fatality each time."

      "headline":"Buy Easy Fatalities.",
      "description":"Alternative to entering a Fatality combo, which can be long and difficult to remember, you can purchase Easy Fatalities from the Xbox Games Store, the PlayStation Store, or from the Steam store. You can also earn Easy Fatalities by playing through the single-player modes in Mortal Kombat. Easy Fatalities are much easier to initiate, but they still do require a user to input a set combo. You can find Easy Fatalities in the Finishing Moves section in the Move List option under the pause menu, alongside the other Fatalities found earlier."
