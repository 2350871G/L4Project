          "description":"Cutting your flowers earlier in the day when it's cool will ensure that the flower has stored carbohydrates, which are required to keep them alive. Keep a bucket of water with you and make sure to transfer them immediately after cutting them. Flowers need a constant stream of food to flourish, and being left out of the water causes them to dry up. Flowers should be cut at varying maturity levels depending on the type of flower. Daffodils, roses, irises and gladiolas should be cut in the bud stage, while delphiniums, marigolds, dianthus flowers should be open before cutting. Use a plastic bucket or pail. Metal can throw the flower's pH balance and reduce its lifespan."

          "description":"Refrigeration at 35\u00b0F (1.5\u00b0C) can triple the lifespan of freshly cut flowers in your house. Doing this before you transfer them to a vase with water slows down water loss, respiration, and development. Your flowers will require less water and die slower if you put them in the fridge. Slowing down the flower's development will allow it to remain in the flowering stage for a longer period of time before wilting and dying. You can also pop your flowers in the refrigerator when you are going to sleep to help preserve them for a longer time."

          "headline":"Recut the stems on your flowers every three days.",
          "description":"Trim one inch from the bottom of the stem at a 45-degree angle using durable gardening tools like shears or clippers. Water bubbles can get trapped on the end of a flower's stem which will prevent it from absorbing water. Keeping your flowers recut will ensure that their water absorption levels remain steady. Flowers like the sunflower develop sap on the end of their stems after some time. You can remedy this by pouring boiling water on the end of the stems for 20 seconds. Do not crush the stem, as this can damage the flower internally and inhibit water absorption."

Remove any leaves or flower petals that look bruised. If you have roses, do not remove the thorns as this has been shown to reduce the lifetime of the flowers. Failing to remove damaged leaves or leaves that are under the water line can promote bacterial growth in your vase."

As a rule of thumb, keep your water at 100\u00b0F to 110\u00b0F (37.7\u00b0C to 43.3\u00b0C). While this applies to most flowers, there are exceptions to this rule.

Scrub down the sides with a soft dish soap and remember to rinse it thoroughly before placing your flowers back into the vase. Other than promoting decay in your plant, certain bacteria are capable of entering a flower's stem and stopping water absorption as well. If you are using a chemical floral preservative, make sure to replace the nutrients as well as the water. Use a bottle brush for a vase with a thin neck. If you are having trouble getting to the crevices of your vessel, mix up a solution containing one part household bleach with ten parts water and allow the vase to soak overnight. Air dry your vase before refilling it with water."

Replace the flower preservatives when you change the water in your vase. Use recommended measurements when using floral preservatives. Homemade flower preservatives usually have mixed results and should be avoided."

While it has shown varying results, adding a penny should work as a fungicide which should collect bacteria. The aspirin works to increase the water's acidity, which helps water absorption.

Add one cup of lemon-lime soda, such as 7Up, one cup of water, and a 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of household bleach to the vase that is housing your flowers.

Another benefit of mouthwash is that it acts as an acidic which helps your flowers with water absorption."
