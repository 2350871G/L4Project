          "description":"Find or buy a pegboard from a home improvement store like Home Depot or Lowes. You can get it cut to whatever size you need and it should only require a few wood screws and drywall anchors to set it up. Paint the pegboard whichever way you like. Try bright colors like red or orange or a design with stars and stripes. Once painted, attach hooks and hang things like baskets, toys, and clothes to get things up off the ground and add space to the room. This is an easily customizable item and can be changed regularly as you need."

          "description":"Buy a cloth or plastic see-through over-the-door shoe organizer for toys like Barbies, stuffed animals, or cars. Simply follow the instructions to hang it over a door and then fill every cubby as needed. You can even divide the shoe organizer in half with different children\u2019s toys. For example, barbies and their clothes can go in the top half and action figures like G.I. Joes can go in the bottom. Using a see-through organizer makes it easy for kids to see what\u2019s in each pocket, which helps make clean-up easier."

          "headline":"Put up some strips of magnetic tape.",
          "description":"Measure out a few strips of magnetic tape to add to a playroom wall. The amount you use will depend on the number of toys you plan to attach. For example, if your child has a large collection of race cars, then you may want 3-5 strips of tape. However, if you have the wall space, you can also just do one long line of magnetic tape. Once you\u2019ve attached it to the wall, simply place the cars or other metal toys along the stripe. Make sure this strip is low enough for children to access easily. You can find magnetic tape at most craft stores or online on Amazon for around $20. It should have one side with a typical tape adhesive covered in thin white paper. Simply peel this off and stick the tape to the wall. The tape should peel off easily. However, if you are having issues, try using a mixture or warm water and dishwasher soap to remove the tape."

          "description":"A hideaway table or desk is a great way to free-up space in a playroom. You can find wall-mounted desks on Amazon or from Ikea for under $50. Everything you need for the set-up is included, outside of a screwdriver. Just make sure to test the durability of the desk before you buy it, as children can be rough in their usage of household furniture. Most fold-away desks only require screws and hinges. You first need to decide where on the wall you want the desk, then use a level and pencil to mark a straight and even line. Once you've done this, you should only have to screw the hinges into the desk, and then screw the other half of the hinges into the wall."

Most chests are already at the perfect height for children, however, you can always add table legs to elevate the chest and make it appear more like a table. Try purchasing wooden table legs from Lowes or Home Depot, which are only $1-$3 each. You can also paint or stain these trunks to match the decor of the room. If you don\u2019t have a chest, try searching in thrift stores or at Goodwill for a cheaper item you won\u2019t mind the kids getting paint and other things on."

If you have a window, try installing a bench with storage directly under it to create a reading area. You can then fill the cubbies with your child\u2019s favorite books."

Doubling Furniture Functionality Turn storage bins into seating. Take a couple of wooden, plastic, or wicker storage bins and attach seat cushions to their tops.

You can even attach wheels to their bottoms to make them easy for kids to move around as needed. Try different colors and patterns for the fabric tops to add character to a playroom. Use chests as tables. Repurpose a wooden or wicker chest to double-up as a table. Most chests are already at the perfect height for children, however, you can always add table legs to elevate the chest and make it appear more like a table. Try purchasing wooden table legs from Lowes or Home Depot, which are only $1-$3 each. You can also paint or stain these trunks to match the decor of the room. If you don\u2019t have a chest, try searching in thrift stores or at Goodwill for a cheaper item you won\u2019t mind the kids getting paint and other things on. Line a wall or under a window with benches. Benches are a great way to get both storage and seating. Look for ones that have cubbies for you to put things away in. You can even get a bunch of baskets or colored storage containers to enliven the room's decor. Use these cubbies to pack away stuffed animals, clothes, or shoes.

You can find floating shelves in plain wood colors like oak or cherry, or in black and white. They are carried in most stores like Target, Home Depot, and Walmart. All hardware required for the shelves is included. However, you will need a drill to put in the drywall screws to make sure these shelves are secure.
