Slowly close the cabinet door until it is lightly touching the straight-edge. Mark a pencil mark on the door where it touches the straight-edge. Move the straight-edge over at least a couple of inches and make a second mark."

          "description":"Now, place your straight-edge on the bottom shelf with its face against the vertical stile (vertical piece of the face frame) opposite the hinged edge of the door. As before, it should stick out a few inches. Hold it as parallel with the side of the cabinet as possible so it\u2019s close to 90 degrees to the face frame of the cabinet. Again, slowly close the door until it just touches the straight-edge. Mark a pencil mark on the door where it touches the straight edge. Raise the straight-edge at least a few inches and make a second mark."

          "headline":"Measure the actual height of the cabinet opening (from the surface of the bottom shelf).",
          "description":"From the pencil mark near the bottom of the door, use that measurement and make a pencil mark at that point near the top of the door, then make a second one a few inches apart from the first one. You should now have two marks near the bottom of the door, two near the top, and two along the opened edge of the door."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Make new reference marks.",
          "description":"Create new reference marks by measuring up \u00bd\u201d from the bottom marks, \u00bd\u201d down from the top marks, and \u00bd\u201d in toward the center of the door from the vertical edge marks. From the new reference marks you just made, line them up with a straight-edge and connect them with a pencil line. Do this along all three edges. These lines represent the size of your piece of sheet metal."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Take measurements from between your reference marks.",
          "description":"Measure the spaces between your reference marks be sure you stay BETWEEN the hinges and the outer line on the door. By taking these measurements once, you have established the vertical measurement for all the cabinets of the same height in your kitchen. For cabinets of different widths, measure from the outer edge of the \u201cmodel\u201d door to the vertical pencil line. Measure that same distance on the other doors and make your reference points. This process will prevent the sheet metal from contacting the face frame of the cabinet. For frameless cabinets, you can use the straight-edge easily at the top, bottom and side without the encumbrance of a face frame. Always remember to measure between the hinge location inside the door and the outer reference line so your sheet metal does not touch the hinges! If the cabinet door has a separate panel within a frame, you can cut the metal to fit the size of the panel (inside surface of the panel) without doing all the measuring and marking. Do not make the sheet metal larger than the panel, or the metal will not attach flatly to the inside of the door."

You will likely have to cut it to size or have someone at the store do it for you. It should be about the thickness of a sheet of poster paper. If it\u2019s too thick, it will be very difficult to cut and be more expensive. Be sure you are not buying sheet aluminum! They look similar, but aluminum is not magnetic."

          "description":"Cutting your metal requires a pair of tin snips, usually under $10 at your home improvement store. Put on your leather work gloves, because cutting sheet metal creates very sharp edges. As you cut with the tin snips, chances are your hands will come in contact with a freshly cut edge. Cut your metal as you would cut a sheet of poster board with scissors. Go slowly and do not completely close the tips of the tin snips at the end of each \u201csnip,\u201d as this tends to create a sharp \u201ctooth\u201d along the cut line. Complete the vertical and horizontal cuts and carefully discard the excess."

  "text":" Measuring the Cabinet Lay a straight edge on the bottom shelf of the cabinet. Measure the inside surface of the cabinet, by first laying a straight-edge face flat on the bottom shelf of the cabinet with one end of the straight-edge sticking out of the cabinet a few inches. Slowly close the cabinet door until it is lightly touching the straight-edge. Mark a pencil mark on the door where it touches the straight-edge. Move the straight-edge over at least a couple of inches and make a second mark. Move the straight-edge on to the bottom shelf. Now, place your straight-edge on the bottom shelf with its face against the vertical stile (vertical piece of the face frame) opposite the hinged edge of the door. As before, it should stick out a few inches. Hold it as parallel with the side of the cabinet as possible so it\u2019s close to 90 degrees to the face frame of the cabinet. Again, slowly close the door until it just touches the straight-edge. Mark a pencil mark on the door where it touches the straight edge. Raise the straight-edge at least a few inches and make a second mark. Measure the actual height of the cabinet opening (from the surface of the bottom shelf). From the pencil mark near the bottom of the door, use that measurement and make a pencil mark at that point near the top of the door, then make a second one a few inches apart from the first one. You should now have two marks near the bottom of the door, two near the top, and two along the opened edge of the door. Make new reference marks.

Also, slightly round the sharp corners. Very carefully, feel the edges to make sure they are smooth. Clean the interior surface of the cabinet door. Before you attach the sheet metal panel, clean the interior surface of the cabinet door and the mounting surface of the sheet metal. It is likely that the sheet metal is treated with an oily film when it comes from the factory, and adhesive will not stick properly to oily or greasy surfaces. Use a household window cleaner to clean metal and the cabinet door. Attaching With Contact Adhesive Spray or roll a thin coat of contact adhesive on the metal and door. Apply contact adhesive to both surfaces to be joined. If you made reference lines on the door, keep the adhesive within those lines. Do not join the two pieces at this time. Allow the adhesive to set for about 10 minutes or until your finger barely sticks to the coated surface. Hold the sheet metal about halfway up with your fingers against the sticky surface. Your fingers will act as \u201cspacers\u201d as you line up the bottom and the right or left edge with the pencil reference lines.

Bond the whole surface. Once you feel the metal is properly lined up, slowly move your fingers up the length of the metal and bond the surfaces together. Press the pieces together for a solid bond. Allow them to set for a couple of hours before using. Attaching With Pan Head Screws Use this method only on solid slab-style doors. This method should not be used on frame and panel doors. You may use either a hand screwdriver or a power driver. Hold your metal panel in place against the door. Make reference marks along the bottom edge, about an inch or two in from the corners. Set the metal panel aside for now. Make a dimple in the door to guide your screws. Using a center punch or a large nail, make a dimple in the door. A couple of taps with a hammer should do to pierce the surface of the door. This will be your starter/pilot hole for your pan head screws. Drive a pan head screw into each pilot hole. Drive your screws in, leaving enough space between the head of the screw and the door so the metal panel will fit in that gap. Set the bottom of the metal panel into the space between the heads of the screws and the door. Hold the panel in place and make two reference marks along the top edge the same way you did at the bottom. Then remove the metal panel. Drill new pilot holes about 1/16th of an inch above those marks. Insert the screws and leave a gap a bit larger than on the bottom. Now place the bottom edge of the metal into place, then flex the metal to pop it into place at the top. Adjust its final positioning then tighten the screws until they hold the panel firmly. Punch one pilot hole in the door at the center of each vertical edge. Punch one pilot hold into the center of each vertical edge, about 1/16th of an inch off the edge. Insert a screw into each hole and tighten until snug. Check to make sure the door closes properly and make any needed adjustments. You are now ready to use your new sheet metal panel for display. Attaching With Double-sided Carpet Tape Clean your bonding surfaces. Make sure both bonding surfaces are clean by cleaning with a household window cleaner. Clean thoroughly, to avoid poor adhesion. Cut and attach vertical strips of carpet tape. Cut strips of carpet tape about \u00bd\u201d shorter than the vertical height of the metal panel. On the bonding face of the metal, press the strip of tape in place about \u00bc\u201d in from the edge with the ends of the strip about \u00bc\u201d from the top and bottom of the metal panel. Cut and attach horizontal strips of carpet tape. Cut two strips at a length nearly equal to the space between the two strips you just placed. Press them into place along the top and bottom edges of the metal. Cut and attach central strips of carpet tape. Cut and place two strips about 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) long somewhere in the center portion of the metal. Peel the protective film off all the strips you just mounted. Be careful not to get them dirty or they may not stick properly. Place and bond the metal into position. Carefully place one edge into position along the reference lines you drew when measuring for the metal. Once the metal is in the proper position, you may bond the entire metal panel to the door. Once the two surfaces are bonded, it is difficult to peel the metal away without damaging it. If you need to remove the metal, heat the metal with a hair dryer to soften the adhesive.
