          "description":"What makes a professional print look professional is the sharpness of the resolution. What resolution you need will depend on what size project you\u2019re working on. You can usually print anything up to 13 in (33 cm) by 19 in (48 cm) without adjusting the resolution from the standard 72 dpi. For larger projects or projects that will be displayed, increase the resolution to up to 300 dpi. To resize the image in Sketchbook Pro for Mac, go to \u201cImage,\u201d then choose \u201cSize.\u201d In the menu box that comes up, make sure \u201cKeep Proportions\u201d and \u201cResample Image\u201d are both checked. Then change the resolution. If you\u2019re using Photoshop, go to \u201cImage,\u201d then \u201cImage Size.\u201d Check the \u201cConstrain proportions\u201d and \u201cResample Image\u201d boxes.

It will give you a good starting point after you adjust the resolution."
