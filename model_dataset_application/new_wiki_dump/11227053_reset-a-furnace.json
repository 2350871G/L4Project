Start by shutting off your furnace\u2019s electrical components. Look on the exterior sides of your furnace for a light switch. Flip that switch to shut down power to the furnace\u2019s fan and motor. Some really old furnaces won\u2019t have a switch. If your furnace doesn\u2019t have a switch, simply ignore this step and move on to turning off the breaker. The light switch will typically have a faceplate and an electrical box to house the wires, just like a regular outlet. If you flip the switch and your furnace kicks on, you were probably trying to troubleshoot the furnace when it was off!"

Flip all of the switches for the room to the off position so that electricity for the room is shut off. This will ensure that all electrical inputs and background processes are off. If your fuse box is unlabeled, simply flip all of the breakers off. Other than the food in your refrigerator getting a little warm, you aren\u2019t going to cause any damage by leaving the breakers off for a little bit."

If it has a plastic frame, it is reusable. Clean a plastic filter with warm water and a clean cloth. Replace disposable filters by buying a filter that is the same size as the original and sliding it in. The dimensions for a disposable filter are always printed on the side of the frame.

This is the oil gauge. If the needle or line on the gauge is in the red, you need to refill the oil on your tank. To refill the tank, go outside to the access pipe and unscrew the cap on the top. Use a funnel to fill it with your specific brand of heating oil. This is typically a service that homeowners pay their heating company to perform for them, since you have to be in possession of a large amount of heating oil.
