Next, cook them in water in either one of two ways:\nIn the oven: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (191 degrees Celsius). Place the beats in an oven-safe dish. Add about \u00bc-inch of water. Place the dish in the oven and bake for 35 minutes or until the beets are tender enough for a knife or fork to puncture them without any effort. On the stovetop: Place the beets in a saucepan. Cover them with water. Bring the water to a boil and then lower to simmer. Cook for 30 minutes or until they are soft enough for your fork or knife to poke through them with zero effort."
