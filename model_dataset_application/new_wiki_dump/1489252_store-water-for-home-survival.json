      "description":"The length of time water can be stored is dependent on the container used, the temperature, the ability of light to get to it, etc. Contaminated water is no good to you, so follow these guidelines:\nUse opaque containers for water. If you are buying bottled water as a back-up, revolve it every few months and replace it with newer stock and either use the old stock or water your plants with it. Store all water away from light. Don't give algae and other lifeforms the chance they're waiting for to grow. Store the water away from anything that could contaminate it such as pesticides, fungicides, insecticides, gasoline, paint, or any other chemicals. Don't store the water where it can freeze outside. An ice block isn't going to be useful when you have no heat to melt it. One exception to this is those living in a hot climate can store some of the water in the freezer as it will melt in the heat."
