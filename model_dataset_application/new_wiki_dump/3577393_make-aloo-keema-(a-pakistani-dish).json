  "text":" In a pressure cooker, put about  1/2 cup of cooking oil and turn the heat on.  Peel the garlic and chop it into little pieces. Then, put it in the pressure cooker. Stir with intervals while doing these steps: Peel the onion and chop it into pieces, \"NOT\" very small pieces; each little piece should be about 1 centimeter (0.4 in).  Peel the tomatoes and chop them in half. Then, slice them into pieces. Get the ginger and peel it. Then, grate it. Remember to keep stirring and when the onion pieces, some of them, are brown, and some light brown, and some white, add the ginger. Keep stirring with NO INTERVALS for one minute. Make sure you don't let the ginger stick and burn at the bottom. Next, add the tomatoes and stir for one minute with two second intervals. While stirring, squish the tomatoes with the wooden spoon. Add half cup of water and stir.  While the water is still there, add one level teaspoon of salt. Then add one heaping teaspoon of red chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of haldi, and one pinch each of: methi (fenugreek), garam masala, and corriander powder to taste. Stir many times and then put the lid of the pressure cooker on. After two minutes, lower the heat. Wait ten minutes.  Next, pull the pressure regulator up so that gas escapes. When no more gas comes out, lift the lid up and carefully, get one of the onion pieces and try to squish it with an easy squish move, and if it squishes, continue with step 14. However, if it doesn't squish, then cook it until it is. Start peeling the potatoes. Once you've peeled them, chop them in half. Then wash them all. When the water in the pressure cooker is dry, then add the lamb mince (also known as Keema).  Stir with intervals.  After 2 minutes add the two green chillies. And carry on step 15. After about 10 minutes from step 15, put the lid back on the pressure cooker.  Wait ten minutes.  Then, turn the heat off and pull the pressure regulator up to escape the gas. When the gas has escaped, take the lid off. Turn the heat back on and stir while putting potatoes inside the pressure cooker.  Get pepper. The picture above shows lots of the slices of the pepper, but you, have to only get 2 of them and chop them into little pieces. Put the pieces into the pressure cooker.  Put the lid back on.  Turn the heat low.  After 10 minutes, turn the heat off, pull the pressure regulator up to escape the gas, then take the lid off.  Stir a bit and serve once the meat has browned. ",
