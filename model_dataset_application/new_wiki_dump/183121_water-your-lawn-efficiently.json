          "description":"Mowing the lawn is essential, but mowing too often or cutting the grass too low can dry out an otherwise healthy lawn. Using the same pattern to mow your lawn can also cause stress to the grass from the repeated wheel tracks that follow the same direction week after week. Try changing the direction(s) you mow in every time you cut the grass. It will help cut down on stress to the lawn, and may also prevent divots from forming in your pattern. Set your mower's wheels to the proper height. There is some variance of recommended heights depending on the type of grass in your yard. Tall Fescue grass, for example, should be kept no shorter than two and a half to three inches, while Bermuda grass should be kept between \u00be of an inch and 1\u00bd inches."

Using too much fertilizer or fertilizing too often will increase the need to water your lawn more frequently and in greater quantities. In late spring and early fall, use a fertilizer that is three parts nitrogen, one part phosphorus, and two parts potassium. This is ideal for maintaining a healthy lawn without needing to over water the grass. Opt for either slow-release fertilizer or a mixture of quick- and slow-release fertilizers for your lawn. Quick-release fertilizer releases all of the nitrogen rapidly, which will require more frequent applications over time. Follow the instructions and recommendations on your fertilizer's packaging label, or read online about how and when to properly apply fertilizer to your lawn."

In addition to keeping the grass at its optimum health, it also reduces airborne dust and helps regulate the temperature of the soil. But if there are parts of your yard that do not get a lot of foot traffic or do not serve an aesthetic purpose (parts of the backyard or side yard, for example), consider reducing how much and how often you water those areas. You can still water them regularly to prevent withering, but they may not need as much water as the rest of the yard. In addition to cutting back on which parts of the lawn you water, you can also reduce evaporation around certain plants or flowerbeds by laying down a layer of organic mulch over the topsoil.

Rainwater is safe to use, as it is the same water that would otherwise naturally irrigate your yard, though there may be restrictions on how rainwater is collected and harvested depending on where you live. Grey water, the gently-used and non-hazardous water from showers, dish sinks, and washing machine runoff, is not safe to drink but is generally considered safe to use for watering your lawn. If harvesting grey water, be sure to use environmentally-safe soaps and detergents. Try to use products that are considered \"plant friendly,\" meaning they are free from salt, boron, and chlorine bleach. Try collecting rainwater. It's safe to use on any part of your lawn (including vegetable gardens), and it helps cut down on municipal water consumption. Some states in the U.S. have their own laws about the collection and use of rainwater. To find out any requirements or restrictions on collecting and using rainwater in your state, check the American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association website, click the Resources tab, and read the section titled Laws, Rules & Codes. An easy way to get started collecting rainwater is to simply arrange buckets or barrels under the downspout coming off your gutter. If you decide that collecting rainwater is something you'd like to pursue more actively, there are more advanced collection methods, like rain barrels."

Each variety has its own advantages, depending on the climate and region in which you live. Perennial Ryegrass is somewhat drought tolerant, easy to establish across the lawn, and can compete well with weeds that sprout up in the yard. Tall Fescue grass is very drought tolerant and has the deepest root system of all turf grasses, running anywhere from three to six feet deep. Tall Fescue doesn't necessarily use less water, but it does use water the same way a deep-root plant would use water. It also stays green during drought, which is advantageous if you live in a drought-prone climate. Fine Fescue grass has a low fertilizer requirement and a high drought tolerance. It can actually go dormant during dry periods when water is absent, and will quickly come back to a healthy shade of green once water is returns. Bentgrass grows well during cool weather, and much like Fine Fescue it can also go dormant during droughts. Bentgrass does not require very much fertilizer, either. Kentucky Bluegrass grows best in cool, humid, semi-arid, and temperate climates. This grass variety is moderately drought-tolerant."

          "description":"Whether you have a large yard that is difficult to manage or you simply want a little more diversity in your yard's landscape, there are plenty of options for non-turf alternatives. Some drought-stricken communities may even offer incentives to homeowners who opt for non-turf alternatives, so it may be worth checking online or with your local department of natural resources to see if your region offers these incentives. Ground cover makes a fine substitute for turf in some yards. Ground cover, like drought-resistant plants, are ideal for low-traffic parts of the yard. Planting ground cover in slanted parts of the yard that tend to lose a lot of water may also help conserve some water and promote a greener yard. Perennials, shrubs, and trees are all excellent alternatives to grass. Many of these plants have drought-resistant varieties that can help control erosion and water loss. Hardscapes, like decking or pavement (including stepping stones), can help cut back on how much you need to water your yard. Hardscapes also create recreation space, as a deck or patio makes an excellent place to sit outside for picnics, meals, or simple downtime."

          "headline":"Evaluate your soil type.",
          "description":"The type of soil under your lawn, as well as the climate and time of year, will dictate how often you need to water your lawn. If you live in an area that is prone to heavy rainfall during parts of the year, for example, you will not need to water as frequently. Certain yards may not reap the full benefits of rainfall, however, depending on the yard's composition and layout. Certain soil types absorb water better than others. A high composition of clay, for example, will prevent water from absorbing into the soil. Clay tends to retain an average around 1.5 inches of water per foot of soil, while fine sand and loamy sand retain the least amount of water at 0.7 and 0.8 inches of water per foot of soil, respectively. Silty loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam have the highest water retention of all soil types, averaging 2.4 inches of water per foot of soil. The layout of the yard is a factor as well. A sloped lawn will not be able to absorb much excess water. Any moisture not readily absorbed will most likely run off downhill."

          "description":"While some may feel that the lawn should be watered on a daily basis, oftentimes this is not necessary. Many factors influence how often you need to water your lawn. In drought-prone Southern California, for example, you may need to water your lawn anywhere from 20 minutes per week to 200 minutes per week, depending on the region, time of year, and hourly sprinkler output. Use the minimum amount of water necessary to maintain your lawn. Using too much water will run up your monthly water bill, waste vital resources, and may end up damaging your lawn with over-saturation. The best measure for determining how often to water your lawn is to check the lawn itself. If footprints or lawnmower tracks remain indented in the grass for longer than 30 minutes after passing through your yard, it is a good sign that your grass is getting dry. Check the color of your lawn. Turf grass that is dry will often turn to a blueish-gray shade, rather than a lush green. You can also check the soil moisture to see if your lawn needs to be watered. Drive a six-inch screwdriver or stake into the ground. If the screwdriver breaks through the soil easily and without much effort, the soil is likely retaining enough water and you can hold off on watering."

You can measure the output of your sprinklers by arranging empty and cleaned tuna cans or cat food cans across your lawn. If you do not have empty cans, several coffee mugs will also work well. Then run the sprinklers for 20 minutes and use a ruler to measure the water depth across the yard. After 20 minutes, add all the depths together from each container in your yard and divide by the total number of containers to obtain an average for the whole yard. Then multiply that number (the total yard measurements over 20 minutes) by three to average your total sprinkler output per hour (60 minutes).
