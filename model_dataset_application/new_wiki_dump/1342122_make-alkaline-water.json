When the baking soda mixes with the water, it increases the alkaline properties of the water. Shake (if you are using a water bottle) or stir (if using a glass) the mixture vigorously to make sure the baking soda mixes in thoroughly with the water. If you are on a low sodium diet, do not add baking soda to your water. Baking soda is high in sodium."

Fill one pitcher (64 oz.) with clean water. Filtered water is the best way to go, but if you don\u2019t have a filter, tap water is okay to use. Cut up one lemon into eighths. Add the lemons to the water but do not squeeze them--simply place them in the water. Cover the water and let it sit overnight for 8 to 12 hours at room temperature. You can add one tablespoon of pink Himalayan sea salt to your lemon water if desired. Adding the salt mineralizes your alkaline water."

The alkalized water makes up about 70% of the produced water and can be used for drinking. Don\u2019t just discard the acidic water. Acidic water can kill many types of bacteria.
