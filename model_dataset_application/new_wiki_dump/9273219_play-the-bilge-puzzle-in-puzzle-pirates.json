The puzzle consists of a board with, when you first start off as an amateur bilger, five different-colored tiles. As you become better and better, the puzzle will grow to six different colors, and eventually, it'll reach seven."

To swap the two tiles selected, simply click the mouse button or use the spacebar. This sounds easy, but you can only swap two horizontal tiles; you can't swap vertically!
