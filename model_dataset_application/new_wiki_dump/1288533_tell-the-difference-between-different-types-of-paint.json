      "description":"Undercoat is used over the primer. It's the coat to add before you add the main color. Depending on the brand purchased, it may be specially tinted or have certain protective properties you need for the surface or area being painted. Most paints require undercoat even if primer has not been needed. Some types of paint may claim that there is no need for an undercoat but generally it ensures a smoother finish if used."
