          "description":"UV light can be extremely damaging for plastic toys and the packaging of most figures. Never place your figures in direct sunlight, and keep them away from windows when they\u2019re in storage. The combination of heat and UV light can harm the plastic and cause paint to peel. When storing your figures, try to find a windowless room. If the room does have a window, make sure your figures are facing away from it."

          "headline":"Store your figures at room temperature in a dry area.",
          "description":"When looking for a storage space, find a room that has a fairly steady temperature around 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C). If you\u2019re concerned about the humidity of the room, use a hygrometer to check that the humidity is around 35-45%. Extreme changes in temperature and humidity can be especially damaging for figures that are still in their original packaging. Closets and cupboards are normally great places for storing an action figure collection. If you have a finished basement, you can also store them there, as long as it doesn\u2019t get too cool or damp."

          "headline":"Purchase sealed storage containers for your most valuable figures.",
          "description":"For collectibles worth over $100, buy a sealed glass storage container. Open the container and carefully position your figure inside. Then, close the container and seal it according to the directions. The container will protect it from dust and dampness. Keep in mind that sealed containers will not protect your figures from changes in temperature or exposure to sunlight. Be sure to keep this in mind when storing your collectibles. Normally, you can find these containers online through websites that specialize in storing collectibles. However, if you have a store that specializes in storage solutions near you, try calling them to see if they have any in stock."

          "headline":"Use a display case if you have a large collection.",
          "description":"Many collectors like to keep their action figures on display. Look for a case that has glass doors to protect your figures while still showing them off. Position your figures on the shelves so that they\u2019re visible but not overly crowded, which can damage them. Some collectors use bookcases with detachable glass doors to store their figures. Keep in mind that glass will not protect the action figures from changes in temperature and exposure to sunlight. If your shelving doesn\u2019t have protective doors, be sure to monitor the temperature and humidity in the room, and keep your figures away from sunlight."

          "description":"If you want to display and protect your figures but don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money, acrylic and plastic shell cases are the perfect solution. Normally, they open on a hinge, and you can insert your figure into the case. Then, close the case and position the container on a shelf. Be sure to keep the containers away from direct sunlight and store them at room temperature."

These will protect your figures from dust and dampness, but allow you to store many figures at once. If most of your figures are outside of their packaging, be sure to wrap them in cloth or place them in resealable bags to prevent them from hitting against each other in the container."

Start by dusting the shelves with a duster if they\u2019re on display, and then use a soft bristle brush, such as a makeup brush or paint brush, to remove particles from your figures and packaging. For delicate figures, spray them with pressurized air to remove the dust without touching them. You can find pressurized air at most grocery or department stores. If you want to buy a few cans at a time, search online retailers like Amazon to see if you can get a better deal."

Once the tablet is about halfway dissolved, flip your figure over in the water to clean the other side. Never place an action figure that has a battery compartment or sticker decals directly into water. This can irreparably damage your figure and can be dangerous to you!

Then, dip a cotton swab or microfiber cloth into the water, and remove excess water by squeezing or pinching. Rub the stained area until the mark disappears, and wipe the area with a dry towel to soak up any leftover water. It may take a few sessions of scrubbing for the soap and water to remove the mark completely. Be patient and use more soapy water as needed. Never use water on an area where there is a sticker decal or near the battery compartment of a figure."

Keep dabbing until the mark disappears, and then wipe the area with a damp towel to rinse it. Dry your figure with a towel and inspect the area to make sure there is no discoloration. Leaving the alcohol on your figure can cause extreme discoloration. Be sure to rinse it completely before putting it into storage."

If you forget this step, remove the batteries as soon as possible to prevent leaks, which happen over long periods of time. If you open the battery compartment of a figure and see a crystallized, white residue, put it down and put on a pair of rubber gloves.

If your figure has a base, try to hold it by the bottom as much as possible to prevent damage to the top portion. If you don\u2019t have a pair of gloves available, use a microfiber cloth or a clean towel to handle your figures. This will act as a thick barrier and protect the plastic."

To get an insurance policy, make sure you have a detailed list of which figures are in the collection, pictures of each figure, receipts, or some other proof of purchase for each figure. Depending on which insurance company you use, they might also require that the figures are kept in a safe, protected environment. If you own a house, you may be able to extend your homeowner\u2019s insurance to include your collection. Call your agent to ask if this is possible."
