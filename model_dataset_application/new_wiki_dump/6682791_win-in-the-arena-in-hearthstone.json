You want to have a solid plan in place when you begin to play but also keep yourself open to changing strategies based on what you draw during any given turn. The 1-2 Strategy: This deck has many cards that require one or two mana crystals. A good strategy is to play as many creatures as possible during any given turn. Keep some creatures in reserve to block. When attacking, try to hit the player directly instead of focusing on their minions. High cost deck: In the early game you will need to rely on your hero ability and cards that protect or heal you until you gain enough mana crystals to play the higher cost cards in your hand. This style of play is an advanced technique. It probably shouldn't be tried till you have played in the arena a few times. Spells: Use this strategy to do direct damage or to buff/heal you and your minions. Damage spells are also effective at taking out creatures with taunt. Playing minions that increase spell damage with this deck can enable you to do devastating damage to your opponent and give them limited options to block."

If you forfeit during a match, it will count towards your number of losses."
