You want the mixture to be as smooth as possible (although, it probably won't be as smooth as with a blender). If you're using berries too, smash them firmly until mushy then combine it with the banana and continue to mix."

Using coconut milk in a milkshake can add to the thickness and deliciousness of the milkshake and it usually only has a hint of coconut."
