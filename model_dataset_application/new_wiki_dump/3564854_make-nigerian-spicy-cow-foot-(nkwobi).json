  "text":" Preparation Cut the cow foot into medium chunks. Your butcher may be willing to cut it for you. Put the powdered potash into a bowl. Add a small quantity of water (about 4 tablespoons) and stir well. Pass it through a fine sieve and set the liquid aside. Cut 1 onion into four big chunks.  Pound the pepper with a mortar and pestle or blitz it.  Grind the crayfish.  Crack and remove the outer shell of the Calabash nutmeg (ehu). Grind with a dry mill, for example, a coffee grinder. Cooking and Garnishing the Cow Foot Wash and put the cow foot chunks in a pot. Add the stock cubes (crushed) and the chunks of onion. Add a small quantity of water and start cooking at medium heat till well cooked. Add just   enough water to prevent burning as you cook. There should not be any stock (water) left in the pot when the meat is done. While the meat is cooking, pour the palm oil into a clean dry pot. Pour in the potash mixture (sieved) into the oil. Stir with a wooden spatula as you pour the potash. You'll notice the palm oil begin to curdle and turn yellow. Keep stirring till all the oil has turned yellow. Add the ground crayfish, pepper and Calabash nutmeg (ehu) seeds. Stir well until they are all incorporated. When the meat is done, add the salt, stir and cook till all the water has dried. Add the well-done cow's foot to the palm oil paste and stir well with the wooden spatula. Put it back on the stove/cooker and heat till the spicy cow foot (Nkwobi) is piping hot, stirring all the time to make sure it does not burn. To prepare the garnish, cut the onions into rings and cut the Gongronema latifolium leaves (utazi) into long thin slices.  Serve the spicy cow foot (Nkwobi) dish in a wooden mortar. Add the thin slices of utazi and onion rings on top for the full effect. Finished! This dish is best served with chilled drinks, such as palm wine, beer, or stout and soft drinks.",
