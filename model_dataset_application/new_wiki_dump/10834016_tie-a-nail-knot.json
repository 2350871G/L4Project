A leader is a transparent connection between the line and the fly, and is often made of monofilament nylon, with the butt end being larger in diameter. Pinch the leader to the line and the tube or nail with your left thumb and forefinger, leaving about 10 to 12 inches of tag end on the leader to allow you to create the knot. You should now be holding the fly line, tube or nail, and leader between the same two fingers. This will keep everything together so you can easily wrap the coils."
