Take special care with birds, who are particularly susceptible to harm from this process, by removing them from the house completely. Note that pet birds are easily harmed and killed by inhaling the fumes that come from the pyrolytic coating on self-cleaning ovens, as well as many other nonstick kitchen items containing a substance known as PTFE. While humans and other pets are less susceptible for toxicity from this chemical, they can also experience irritation from PTFE fumes while running the cleaning cycle. Pets should be kept on another floor or removed area of the house for safety, and humans should also try to stay away, except to monitor the progress of the oven cleaning."

You will notice an unpleasant odor from your oven once it reaches high heat for the cleaning cycle. This is due to the heating of the pyrolytic coating, as well as the burning food material. You can also consider setting up a fan faced toward an open window or door to help pull the smell from the oven outdoors. Do not perform the self-cleaning function on your oven if you don\u2019t have these ventilation options available. Your kitchen can fill with smoke and fumes, set off smoke detectors, and become very overheated."

Some oven racks are also coated with the pyrolytic material needed for self-cleaning and are thus intended to remain inside the oven for the cleaning cycle. Standard stainless steel racks should typically be removed. Consult your model\u2019s manual to be sure of this.

Then wait the 2-4 hours it takes for the full cycle to complete. Some ovens will feature a countdown or words on the display to indicate the phases of the cleaning cycle and the time remaining (for example, cLn 4:00). Some oven owners experience problems with their ovens after self-cleaning cycles, especially after repeated cycles on older ovens. This is because the prolonged high heat can more quickly damage heating elements and electronic control panels. For a lower risk of this, try setting the cleaning cycle to just an hour if you are able to, or opt for a gentle manual cleaning."
