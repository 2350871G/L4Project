      "headline":"Cover the sago and microwave for 5 - 10 minutes depending on your microwave.",
      "description":"Stir every 3 -4 minutes. If the sago has absorbed all the coconut milk but is not yet completely transparent, add more (or water, but you do not want to add very much water since the creaminess of this dessert comes from the coconut). Extra liquid can be drained off, but too little will result in a gluey (but still delicious!) dessert. The picture shows how your sago will look when done - transparent with a small white core. If you are unsure, taste the sago! Microwaving your sago is not only quicker - it means you CANNOT burn your dessert. Nothing is more annoying then burning your sago after 30 mins of simmering on the stove!"

      "headline":"Stir your sago and add your sugar or desired sweetener.",
      "description":"Palm sugar is the traditional sort, but any sugar or even artificial sweetener will work. You will need less than you think, since the creaminess of the coconut milk will add some sweetness. For this reason this recipe can make a really delicious honest low fat / calorie dessert."
