  "text":" Homemade Cork Board Save up wine corks over a period of weeks and months. If you want to make this craft soon, you can inquire at a local restaurant or wine bar to see if they will save wine corks that they usually throw away. Keep in mind a 16 by 20 inch (40.6 by 50.8 cm) board requires approximately 100 corks, if they are evenly cut in half. Find an old picture frame, a strong piece of cardboard, MDF or a piece of plastic. This will serve as the backing to your cork board. Choose something that already has a frame around the edges, or make a frame out of reclaimed wood or metal. Think about preferences of the person you are planning to give the gift to. A cork board is a great gift for wine lovers and it can be used in the kitchen, hallway or office. Choose a frame that reflects the interior d\u00e9cor preferences of this person. Glue the outside frame to your cardboard or MDF with very strong craft glue. Allow it to dry. Cut your corks in half lengthwise with an X-acto knife. This is not necessary to create a cork board; however, the board will be sturdier and more durable if you glue on a flat surface. This part of the project may take a few hours, depending upon the size of your cork board. Place the frame on a flat work surface. Gather all your corks nearby. Place a medium-sized line of glue down the length of your cork. Place it vertically in the top corner of your frame, making sure there isn't a space between the frame and the cork. Glue and place another cork next to it vertically. Glue 2 corks horizontally right next to the 2 vertical corks. The width of these corks should equal the length of the vertical corks. Continue this pattern, gluing corks in groups of 2 horizontally and vertically across the board. You may need to cut your corks into smaller sizes near the end of the board to ensure there is no empty space between the corks and the frame. Allow the glue to dry completely according to package instructions. Attach a hanger to the back of the cork board. Wrap it and give it away as a present. For a twist on this project, use a smaller frame to make a trivet or smaller pieces of cardboard or MDF to make a set of coasters. Vinyl Record Bowl Pick out a vinyl record that you do not have plans to use in the future. This is a great project if you have vinyl records that you cannot sell or play, but you want to make a gift for someone who loves music. While vinyl building materials are often recycled, records are made of such strong plastic that they cannot normally be recycled in post-consumer recycling programs. Preheat your oven to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65.5 degrees Celsius). This is usually the lowest setting, or \"warm\" setting on an oven. Choose a stoneware bowl to use as the mold for your record bowl. The bowl must be oven safe, so check the manufacturer's indications when using any other type of bowl. Place the bowl upside down in the oven. Use potholders or kitchen mitts to slide it to the center of the rack. Center the record on top of the bowl.  Wait approximately 5 minutes. Turn on your oven light so you can see when the record begins to soften, melting slightly. Open the oven and remove the bowl and record with oven mitts.  Turn it over as soon as you can. Place it on a heat-proof surface, like the stovetop. Press the record onto the bowl with your oven mitts, while the record is still very warm. Make sure to smooth it up on all sides. The record will have extra plastic when it is bent, so it will form a ridged effect. Allow the record to dry around the bowl. Place it back in the oven at 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65.6 degrees Celsius) to reshape it. Personalized Placemats Decide upon a theme for your gift. You can choose a holiday theme, a seasonal theme or photographs and colors based on the person's favorite things. Clip out pictures from magazines, use old greeting cards or gather old photos. Also, find ribbons, lace, leaves, and letters to form the person's name. Tear off a piece of paper towel that is the size you would like your placemats to be. Tear off 1 to 3 more pieces of the same size, depending on how many mats you would like to make. Placemats often come in a set of 4. Place the first paper towel on your work surface.  Arrange your collage elements on top of your paper towel. Create an attractive design. You can set out all of your paper towels and do this part at the same time on a large table. Cut a sheet of contact paper that is slightly bigger than your piece of paper towel. Contact paper is often used for easy laminating or covering kitchen cabinets and shelves. It forms an easy to clean substance. Remove the paper off the back of the contact paper. Make sure to do this very carefully, so that the paper doesn't fold in on itself. Align the contact paper right over 1 side. Move from 1 side to the other slowly lowering the piece of contact paper horizontally a few inches at a time. Smooth out any bubbles that are formed as you go. Turn the placemat over. Cut out another piece of contact paper. Cover the back side with this piece of contact paper in the same fashion. Cut the placemat approximately 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) from the edge of the paper towel line all the way around the perimeter. Repeat these steps with the remaining placemats.",
