The smart straw is a long red tube that, in its undeployed state, remains snug against the WD-40 canister.

If you\u2019re using a WD-40 canister that doesn\u2019t have a smart straw, identify the location of the actuator orifice (the place from which the WD-40 issues) and aim it toward the door hinge. The actuator orifice should be one inch (two centimeters) from the door hinge you wish to apply WD-40 to. It can also help to tap the hinge pin up just slightly and spray the WD-40 in the gap on top of the hinge. This allows the spray to penetrate the inside of the hinge and the pin."

WD-40 canisters emit their contents quite quickly, so do not hold the actuator down for prolonged periods. Instead, press down on the actuator using your index finger, then release it quickly. WD-40 will leave the canister. Apply the WD-40 in quick bursts, moving from the top of the door hinge to the bottom."

After applying WD-40 to the door hinge, wipe it clean by dipping a microfiber cloth in some hot, soapy water. Wring it out, then wipe the door hinge with the cloth. To prevent rust, wipe the hinge down with a dry microfiber cloth. You can also use a paper towel sprayed with all-purpose cleaner. If you lifted up the hinge pin, remember to tap it back down when you finish spraying."
