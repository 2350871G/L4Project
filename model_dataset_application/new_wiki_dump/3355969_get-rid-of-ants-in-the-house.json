The sugar will attract the ants, but when they eat the sweet mixture, the borax will kill them by breaking down their digestive systems. Every other day, add fresh solution to the parchment paper. At first, you may see a large swarm of ants around the sugar and borax mixture, but that\u2019s perfectly normal! Just keep replenishing the mixture every other day.
