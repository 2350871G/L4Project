          "description":"Pomegranates don't have many soil requirements. Almost any type will do, but it needs to drain well. If you have clay-based soil or another type with poor drainage, replace it with a looser topsoil. A visual test is an easy way to check your soil's drainage. Dig a 1 foot (0.30 m) x 1 foot (0.30 m) hole in the ground, and wait until the soil in it is dry to the touch (this might take a day or more). Pour enough water into the hole to fill it up. If it takes more than a few hours for the water to drain out of the hole, then your soil has poor drainage."

If the air temperature isn\u2019t mostly at or above these temperatures, use a soil thermometer to check the ground temperature.

The goal is to remove any weeds, large rocks, or other debris, and to loosen up the soil so that it will be easier for the plants to grow. After debris is removed and clumps of dirt are broken, go over the soil again with a rake to even it out again."

However, you\u2019ll have to plant them in pots in regular potting soil and keep them indoors in a sunny area. You do not have to use special seedling containers if germinating your seeds indoors.
