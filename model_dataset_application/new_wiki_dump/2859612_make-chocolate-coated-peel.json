  "text":" Preparing the Peel Cut each orange or other citrus fruit with a sharp paring knife. Cut lengthwise, into 6 to 8 sections. Remove the peel from the flesh of each section. The flesh can be used to make juice, cook with or for eating. Cut the peel. Cut into strips measuring about 1/4 inch/5mm wide. Cooking the Peel Place the strips into a saucepan. Pour over enough cold water to cover the peel. Bring to the boil slowly. Cook on low, gentle heat for about 15 minutes. Drain the water. Repeat again. This time, keep the water that is drained from the peel. Pour the sugar and glucose into the saucepan with the water. Mix. Add the drained peel. Cook gently until the syrup thickens. The peel strips should also look soft and clear. Drain thoroughly. Set aside the peel strips to cool. Preparing the Chocolate Place the grated or chopped chocolate into a bain marie or double boiler. If you don't have a ready-made one, a bowl sitting in a pan of water can also work. Bring the water to a simmer beneath the chocolate bowl. Stir the chocolate to help it break down and melt. Remove from the heat when the chocolate has melted an appears smooth. Set aside to cool slightly. Dipping the Peel Prepare baking sheets by lining with parchment paper or foil. Alternatively, roll out a silicone mat over the baking sheet. Test the chocolate temperature. It is ready for dipping when it is just warm and has slightly thickened. Dip the strips. Dip one strip at a time:\nDip into the chocolate while holding the end in the tips of a finger and thumb. Dip right in (you'll get chocolate on your fingers, it's a small sacrifice). Lift the peel up slightly. Allow surplus chocolate to drip back into the bowl. Transfer the dipped piece to the lined sheet. Repeat with each peel strip until all have been dipped. When aligning them on the sheet, keep them separate from each other and not touching. Let set at room temperature. The peel will firm up as it dries. If it's really hot in your kitchen, place in the refrigerator to set. Storing and Serving Lift the chocolate coated peel off the baking sheet once set lining one by one. They can be eaten immediately or they can be stored in an airtight container. Give as a gift. There are various possibilities for presentation, such as:\nLine a flat candy box with tissue paper, and place wax or parchment paper on the base over the tissue. Arrange a row of chocolate coated peel, then add another layer of paper and close the tissue over the top. (Several layers can be added by adding paper, then chocolate peel, then paper, etc.) Place the lid over the top and finish with a ribbon or elastic wrap. Place in a small clear jar.
