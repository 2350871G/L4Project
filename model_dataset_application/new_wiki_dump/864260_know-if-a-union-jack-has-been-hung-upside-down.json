  "text":" Examining the Stripes Look at the white diagonal stripes on the side closest to the flagpole. The white stripes on the Union Jack are not all the same size. The wider white stripes on the side closest to the flagpole should sit on top of the diagonal red stripes. The white stripes represent Scotland\u2019s Saint Andrew\u2019s Cross while the red ones represent Ireland\u2019s Saint Patrick\u2019s Cross. A good mnemonic device to use is \"wide white top.\" Look at the white diagonal stripes on the side furthest from the flagpole. On the side furthest from the flagpole, the white stripes that run diagonally should be thinner on the top of the red stripe, and thicker below the red stripe. This applies to both white stripes on the side furthest from the flagpole. Saint Andrew's Cross was on the flag first and takes precedence over Saint Patrick's cross. Ensure the thick white line is on the top left, if hung vertically. When hanging your flag vertically, the thick white stripe should be on the top of all the other stripes on the top left hand side of your flag. The top edge of the flag should become the left edge of the flag when hanging it vertically.

Fly the flag upside down for a distress signal. Flying the Union Jack upside down is a coded distress signal, and should only be used as such. In the UK, flying the flag upside down may be considered an insult, even if it was an honest mistake. Hanging the Flag In Other Circumstances Assume the pole is on the left if it\u2019s a graphic flag. When drawing the flag or putting up a graphic of the flag with no pole, assume the pole is on the left side of the flag. This means that the thick white stripes should lay over the red stripes on the left side of the flag. Drape the top left of the flag over the top left of the shoulder, when draping it on a coffin. When draping the flag over a coffin for a funeral service, make sure that the top left of the Union Jack be laid over the top left corner of the coffin. This is the traditional way to drape the flag for military funerals. Before cremating or burying the body, the flag should be removed and folded.
