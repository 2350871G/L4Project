For a bolder bouquet, choose complementary colors or flowers with a major contrast, such as dark red Barcelona roses and white baby's breath. Consider how vivid the colors are as well. A bright, vivid flower will drown out pastels, so it's best not to mix them together."

Expand this to a similar ratio for a larger bouquet, or divide it into three layers with large, medium, and smaller flowers."

Fill in the gaps between with your other flowers in the same way, so the mix of flowers are distributed throughout the bouquet. Make the overall shape symmetrical, and avoid glaring imbalances of color."

Use these if you'd like to add a little green throughout your bouquet and soften the presentation. If you like, leave a few sprays hanging down over the edge of the bouquet. For more dramatic effect, you can add large, protruding ferns or other foliage at the back of the bouquet. As a rule of thumb, have about 30% of your arrangement by leaves or greenery. This includes the leaves of the main flowers."

To help the flowers last longer, pour a little colorless soda into the water, or use flower food sold at florists for this purpose. The choice of vase can complement the arrangement. You could use ginger jars for a high society function, or antique milk bottles to decorate a rustic home."
