Organizing Your Important Documents Start to organize the remaining files. Move to a desk or big table and organize the papers into piles that are logical and sensible to you. These will become your individual files. Make piles that will help you find exactly what you\u2019re looking for. Consider categories for home cabinets such as:\nUtilities\nAuto\nMedical\nPet\nBusiness\nHome\nTaxes\nFinances Ask coworkers for advice about work cabinets. There may be specific company conventions for organizing papers. If not, file chronologically or alphabetically. Ask tidy coworkers what systems work best for them. Keep your categories simple.

Put the papers in so that the document at the top of the stack is at the front of the folder. This will keep the documents in the same order that you organized them in. Making Files Easy to Find Clearly label each folder. Make sure that the writing on the tab is large, legible, and makes sense to you and others in your office or family. Use a label maker for extra clarity. Let each drawer hold its own category, and label it clearly as well. Divide your files among drawers in ways that make sense to you, with each drawer containing a distinct category. Each category should contain related files, which will help you find things more easily. Financial information like tax documents, investment files and mortgage statements might go in one drawer.

Change your system if it doesn\u2019t make sense. After a month or two of use, don't be afraid to change the things that aren't working for you. Move different files to the front, or break up categories that are hard to tell apart. Remember that your filing cabinet is a system for you, and it needs to conform to your work flow. Maintaining the Organization Be proactive to stay organized. Pay immediate attention to mail and documents as they come in, and once you\u2019ve dealt with them, file them right away. Set up an inbox on your home or office desk. Look through your incoming mail once a day. You won\u2019t lose track of anything this way, and it won\u2019t pile up. Filing won\u2019t seem like such a chore it's done a little bit at a time. Reorganize your cabinet often.
