Delay this by only washing your strawberries right before you eat them or use them in a recipe. If you have already washed a batch of strawberries, pat dry with a paper towel.

Fruit will break down even if the organisms that feed on it are killed, and too much liquid may actually break it down faster. If many of the strawberries in the batch had to be thrown out due to mold, it may be worth it to apply one part white vinegar and three parts water with a spray bottle. Otherwise, use vinegar washes only when washing the fruit, directly before using. Rubbing the fruit with your fingers while washing will dislodge dirt and micro-organisms, and is more effective than only holding the fruit in running water. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/87\\/Keep-Strawberries-Fresh-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Keep-Strawberries-Fresh-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/87\\/Keep-Strawberries-Fresh-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Keep-Strawberries-Fresh-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
