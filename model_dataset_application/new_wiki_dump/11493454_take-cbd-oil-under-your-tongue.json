          "description":"To use CBD oil under your tongue, you\u2019ll need a tincture, which is CBD dissolved in a carrier oil (such as sesame or coconut oil). Tinctures typically come in the form of drops or sprays. Tinctures in drop form usually go under your tongue, while sprays can go under your tongue or inside your cheeks."

          "headline":"Avoid eating right before or after using the tincture.",
          "description":"Eating immediately before or after you take the CBD can affect how consistently it absorbs into your bloodstream. Hold off on having anything to eat for 15-20 minutes after using the tincture, or wait a similar amount of time after eating before you take your dose. This doesn\u2019t mean you should take CBD oil on an empty stomach. In fact, taking CBD while there\u2019s food in your stomach can increase the level of CBD in your bloodstream. Brushing your teeth right before you use the tincture may also help it enter your bloodstream more effectively."

Measure out an appropriate dosage of the CBD tincture with the dropper and place the drops directly under your tongue.Tip: Swallowing a high-quality CBD tincture won\u2019t harm you, but swallowing it too soon will make it take longer to enter your bloodstream. You might not start feeling the benefits of the CBD for half an hour or more. Don\u2019t put the tincture on top of your tongue. It won\u2019t absorb into your bloodstream as effectively, and you may accidentally swallow it too soon. If the tincture is in the form of a spray, spritz it under your tongue. The label on the product should tell you how much CBD is in each puff of the spray."

          "description":"Keep the CBD under your tongue for at least 30 seconds to give it time to enter your bloodstream and start working. You may experience a buildup of saliva in your mouth while you\u2019re holding onto the drops, but try to resist the urge to swallow!

Be sure to disperse the liquid throughout your mouth, making contact with your cheeks and the area under your tongue. This will allow the CBD to absorb rapidly into your bloodstream."

Before taking CBD oil, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits.Tip: Look for a doctor who specializes in medical marijuana, if there are any in your area. Doctors who work with cannabis are likely to have experience with CBD products. Give your doctor a full list of any medications or supplements you are currently taking. Let your doctor know if you are currently pregnant or nursing, or if you have any other health concerns. If you experience side effects while using CBD, stop taking it and consult your doctor."

However, your doctor should be able to give you some recommendations about what dose will be safe and effective for you. If you\u2019re just taking CBD, 10 mg is a good starting dose. A common starting dose for sublingual CBD with THC is 2.5-5 mg.\nUntil you know how the CBD will affect you, it\u2019s a good idea to use a relatively low dose.

Look for products that have been analyzed by reputable third party laboratories. When you buy CBD from a store or dispensary, ask to see the COA (certificate of analysis) for the product.
