Consider the following places from which people often draw their water: \nRainfall: You can collect and store rainwater. It is usually pure enough for drinking, cooking, and bathing. Beware, however, of the chemical contaminants in \"acid rain.\" Groundwater: You can collect water from underground using a tube well or a pump machine. This is usually pure water, although chemicals and bacteria can seep into the water table and contaminate this source. From a lake or pond: you can collect water from ponds, but this water is not usually potable. It must be purified before drinking. You can, however, use it for watering or irrigation purposes. From a river/canal/sea: This water can be used for irrigation. This is big source of all water of our daily use. Water from air: By applying new technology we can get collected water from air. This may be a very small amount, but it could be useful in some circumstances."

Grey water is water that has contaminants but may not be necessarily toxic, however it does need to be filtered and processed before it is classified as clean. This grey water can be distinguished further by where it comes from and the one that is most suitable for collection is rain water. Apart from standard outside water use, grey water can also be used in cooling your house and filtration for more drinking water."

A good rule of thumb is: if you have a one thousand square-foot roof area and have it all guttered and piped into a rain holding tank, you should gather 600 gallons from a 1\" rainfall event. Metal roofs are best, but shingle roofs can work fine. Most folks will design in a \"first flush\" device that routes the first 20 or so gallons of run-off into a separate small tank. This \"first flush\" rainwater will contain dust, bird droppings, small leaves, etc that you don't want to get into your main holding tank. But if not, these items will settle to the bottom of your holding tank and won't be a big problem. Most rain tanks have a 2\" threaded hole on one side just above the bottom of the tank, so you can attach a hose, or a pump to pump for a distance uphill. You can gravity feed from the bottom of the main tank into your system for garden watering. You can also use a small 12 volt electric, \"on demand\" pump. Think about how to protect this pump and piping if you live in a cold climate."
