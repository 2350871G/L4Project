Use a duster to periodically dust off your wood doors to keep the dust and cobwebs from building up over time. Try to dust your wood doors, especially in the grooves of the door, once every week or so to keep them looking nice. This will also help prevent larger stains from forming. This is especially important for exterior doors because it will help keep spiders and insects from congregating near the entrance to your home."

You may need to rinse the cloth as you go to keep it clean enough to do the job, especially if there is significant buildup of dust or dirt. You can add a bit of mild dish soap to your damp rag if the dirt seems resistant to wiping. But be sure to clean off all of the soapy residue when you finish."

You can sand the old varnish off \u2013 a very time consuming task. Or you can use chemical strippers to remove the layers of paint. Either option will work well, but remember that chemical stripping must be done in a ventilated area with proper precautions (like wearing a dust mask). There are several types of chemical strippers \u2013 liquid, brushable pastes, and wash away strippers. In any case, you apply the chemical stripper to the wooden door and let it sit until dry.

Wipe down the door thoroughly before you apply any finishing stain or paint. Choose a stain that is made specifically for indoor wood (unless this in an exterior wood door) and choose a color that suits your d\u00e9cor. You may need to sand down the door or scrape (and then sand) away any existing varnish that is chipping or flaking. Apply the stain or varnish and let it dry completely before you begin using it like normal again. If there is a glass window on your door, make sure you tape it off with painter\u2019s tape before you begin staining. Otherwise, you might get the glass dirty or accidentally paint it."

Use a regular all-purpose cleaner or a solution of vinegar and water to wipe down and sanitize both sides of the door knobs. The fixtures come into contact with the most bacteria, so it\u2019s important to address this when cleaning your wood doors."
