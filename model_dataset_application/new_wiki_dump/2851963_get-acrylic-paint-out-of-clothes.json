  "text":" Preparing to Treat Your Clothing Act quickly. Regardless of the method you choose to remove the acrylic paint from your clothing, the faster you respond to treating the stain, the more likely it is that you'll successfully remove it from the clothing. Scrape any congealed or blobbed paint off your clothing with a spoon or knife. If the paint is still wet, dab it gently with a paper towel or cloth to soak up the excess paint. The key is to get as much paint off as possible as soon as possible. A bristled brush may help with tougher fabrics, especially if the paint has congealed in large globules.

Rubbing will push the excess paint further into your clothing and make it even more difficult to remove. Once you have dabbed off the extra wet paint you can proceed to any of the following steps. Removing the Paint with Isopropyl Alcohol Soak the stained area with the isopropyl alcohol. The stained area should be completely saturated, so be generous with the amount. You can buy isopropyl alcohol online or at your local pharmacy for a relatively low price. CVS will sell you a bottle for $ 2.50. Scratch at the paint. Use your fingernail, a wooden stick, a coin, or another item to scrape away at the paint and try to lift it off the fabric.

Hopefully the stain will have been lifted out by both the alcohol and the wash. If you aren\u2019t satisfied you can repeat the process over again, but it might be too late. Removing the Paint with Ammonia and Vinegar Soak the stained part of the clothing with cold water. Drop it into a sink or bucket filled up with water. Let it soak in there for a minute before you continue. You want it to be thoroughly drenched. Mix together 1 cup/240ml of ammonia, 1 cup/240ml of white vinegar and a handful of salt. Do this in a separate bowl. You can make the mixture while your clothing is soaking in the water to save time. Drain the water from the soaking clothing. Twist the clothing together to wring out the water. Try to get out a good amount of water so that it\u2019s not dripping heavily, but don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s still wet or damp. You want it to be damp \u2013 that was the whole point of soaking it after all. Dip a lint-free cloth or sponge in the solution of ammonia and vinegar. Now scrub the paint stain with this cloth or sponge. Don\u2019t be afraid to scrub pretty hard. Dip in the solution as often as needed until the stain appears to be lifting.

If you still aren\u2019t satisfied you can repeat the process but you probably will only see results with diminishing returns. Removing the Paint with Dish Detergent Turn the garment inside out - or at least the part where the stain is. Hold it under warm running water to try to flush out as much of the paint as possible. Mix one part liquid dish detergent with one part warm water. This is the solution you are going to use to attempt to get rid of the stain. This method is helpful because you are likely to have dish detergent on hand. Dip a lint-free cleaning cloth or sponge into the solution. Dab and sponge the stain with vigor; avoid rubbing too much though, as this can spread the stain. Don\u2019t be afraid to use your fingernails on the stain. Try to get out as much as possible.

Just wash these clothes the way you normally would wash them. Make sure the article of clothing can be machine washed. Now dry your clothes as you normally would and check for the stain again. Hopefully it has now gone. Removing the Paint with Window Cleaner or Hairspray Gently blot the stain with a cleaning rag or paper towel. Don't rub the paint in. This step is only needed if the paint is still wet. Spray the window cleaner or hairspray onto the cleaning cloth or sponge. Hold the dampened area over the top of a bottle of nail polish remover and moisten with a little acetone. If you have either window spray or hairspray in the house, both of these products might remove the stain. It's recommended that you test an inconspicuous area on the piece of clothing first to be sure the fabric can handle the chemicals in these products. If not, use a different method. Scrub the paint stain with a the moistened cloth. Position the cloth over the stain and start scrubbing up and down. Try not to be too vigorous - you want to avoid spreading the stain.
