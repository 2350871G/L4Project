Otherwise, just follow your taste buds\u2014from pumpernickel to sourdough, there is no wrong answer. Avoid bread with large air bubbles or holes, as your cheese may melt right through and drip out."

          "headline":"Use dry, day-old bread if you have it.",
          "description":"Since the moisture in fresh bread makes it soggy (unlike a hot oven, a microwave won't evaporate the moisture, which would allow it to get crispy), a dry piece of bread will fare much better in a microwave. Always check old bread for mold, just to be safe."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use sliced sandwich bread if possible.",
          "description":"Each slice of pre-sliced bread will have the same thickness, which means they will toast evenly. If you are buying an unsliced loaf from a bakery, ask if they can slice it for you. Most bakeries, and bakery departments at grocery stores, have a bread slicer. If you slice the bread by hand, use a serrated bread knife and try to cut the slices about 3/4 of an inch thick. Bread at this thickness will fit in a standard toaster and be thin enough for the microwave heat to penetrate."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pick a cheese that melts easily.",
          "description":"American and Cheddar are the go-to cheeses for a grilled cheese, but you can branch out with cheeses like Monterey Jack, Gruyere, Munster, Gouda, or Brie, as they all melt smoothly. Avoid fresh, crumbly or very hard, aged cheeses, including fresh goat cheese, Feta, and aged Parmesan. These cheeses just don't melt well when they are the main cheese in a sandwich. A very hard cheese like Parmesan will melt smoothly if you grate it and pair it with a melter, like Cheddar. The moisture in the Cheddar will help the Parmesan melt better. If you can't resist those hard-to-melt cheeses, you can still add them to your sandwich for the taste (like you would add pickles or a tomato). Just make sure you also have plenty of cheese that melts easily, like Havarti or American."

          "headline":"Choose your spread.",
          "description":"Butter is the classic choice, but margarine or mayonnaise will also infuse your bread with a richer flavor and help crisp the outside."

        {
          "headline":"Consider adding extra ingredients to your sandwich.",
          "description":"Pickles, tomatoes, jalapenos, avocado, even potato chips\u2014get creative with additional fillings if you want to branch out from the classic cheese-and-bread-only sandwich. Up your protein intake with a few slices of ham, turkey, or other deli meat. Just wipe off extra moisture before putting it on your sandwich. Remember that ingredients with additional moisture\u2014like tomatoes\u2014might make your sandwich a little soggy. Enjoy your sandwich with a side of mustard, ketchup, sriracha, or tomato soup."

That way if your bread is a little under-toasted, you can pop it back in at the lowest setting to crisp it up. The drier the toast, the better. You will be adding moisture back into the bread when you microwave it with the the cheese and butter. Too much moisture can make your sandwich soggy."

          "description":"The dry, unbuttered side of the bread should be touching the cheese, with the buttered side on the outside. Two slices of cheese at about 3/4oz (or about 1.5oz total) is usually plenty of cheese. Make sure the cheese is evenly distributed across the bread so it melts evenly. You can tear slices into smaller pieces to make them fit. Don't pile your sandwich too high with extras. Microwave heat can't penetrate very deep--only about 1-1 1/2 inches--so a fat sandwich may not heat all the way through and your cheese might not melt."

You can also see if the cheese is melted by trying to lift the top slice of bread. If the cheese is fully melted, the bread will stick together and be difficult to separate."
