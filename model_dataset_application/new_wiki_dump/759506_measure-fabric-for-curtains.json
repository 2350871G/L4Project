For example, let's say you're working with a 48\"-wide, 36\"-tall window with a curtain rod 6\" above. You want standard 4\" overlays (both vertical and horizontal), 1/2\" hems, and a fullness ratio of 1.8 for a gathered heading style. You would like your curtains to be broken up into two panels. Your final estimated width would be: The width (48\") plus twice the overlay (4\"). You would then divide this length (56\") by the number of panels (2). Next, add four times the hem (0.5\"). Finally, multiply this final number (30\") by the fullness ratio (1.8), yielding a width of 54\". This can also be expressed with the equation 1.8 x ((48 + 2 x 4)/2 + 4 x 0.5) = 54. Your final estimated height would be a much simpler: Just add the height of the window (36\") to four times the hem (0.5\") along with the overlay (4\") and distance to the rod (6\"). In this example, you would need to buy 48 inches (120 cm) of fabric. This can also be expressed as the equation 36 + 4 x 0.5 + 4 + 6 = 48."

Next, divide this number by 36 (there are 36 inches in a yard). Round up to the nearest whole yard. Using the previous example: Take the final height (48\") and multiply it by the number of panels needed (2). Divide this length (96\") by the number of inches in a yard (36\"), giving you a minimum yardage of 2.67. The equation used here would be (48 x 2)/36 = 2.67 yards (2.44 m).

To do this, you will need to modify your calculations slightly. Start by determining the vertical repeat of the pattern. This is typically listed on the fabric's product information. Divide your final height by the vertical repeat. If the resulting quotient isn't a whole number, you'll need to adjust your yardage. Using the previous example with a vertical repeat of 12.5 inches (31.8 cm): Divide the final height (48\") by the vertical repeat (12.5), which is 3.84. This number rounded up would be 4. You will need to calculate your yardage again using 4 times the vertical repeat (or 50\") in place of the final length. The number yards you'll need to buy would be: (50 x 2)/36 or 2.78 yards. Rounded up, this number is 3 yards. Luckily, in this instance you would be paying for the same amount of fabric as you would if it wasn't patterned. If you skip this step, you will end up with curtains with patterns that don't match up. If that's the look you want, then go for it.
