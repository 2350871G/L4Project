If you want to make a good gesture for the environment or save money, you can clean and recycle an old bottle with dispenser instead of buying a new one. Choose a sturdy and aesthetically pleasing bottle. Remember that you want to use it for a long period of time. If possible, test a few bottles. Make sure that the pump works well and look for a sturdy bottle which can survive a fall on the floor."

The most common allergic reactions are caused by the following ingredients: QAC, iodine, iodophors, chlorhexidine, triclosan, chloroxylenol and alcohols. Look for a soap with moisturizer to protect the skin of your hands."

          "description":"Pour tap water into your empty hand soap bottle until it is one third of the way full and then add the gel soap refill until another third of the space is filled. Shake well to mix the gel and the water until they form a liquid. Tighten the pump back onto the hand soap bottle. Add the water first. If you don't, the water will make the soap foam up. Do not fill the bottle beyond two thirds of the way. If you do, the bottle will overflow when you screw the cap back on. If the dispenser pump is not springing back to the up position, rub a bit of petroleum jelly on the dispenser stem to get it freely moving again. The mixture must be diluted enough to flow through the pump. If the dispenser is clogged, clean it and add more water to the mixture."

          "description":"In addition to an empty bottle with a dispenser pump, you will need liquid scent-free soap and perfumed essential oils. Essential oils will determine the color and the scent of your foaming hand soap and are believed to have various health properties. Make sure to use a scent-free soap. Otherwise, the soap will overpower the subtle smell of the essential oils. Essential oils can be found in most supermarkets and health shops. There is a large range of colors and scent, such as orange, rosemary, violet, and many more. Aromatherapy claims that essential oils have many health benefits. While some are true, many others are largely exaggerated."

Wear an apron to avoid staining your clothes and use gloves if you have sensitive hands. Keep a kitchen roll handy in case water spills on the table or on the floor. Be particularly careful with essential oils. They stain easily and are very hard to remove."

If the scent is not strong enough, add another teaspoon of essential oils. Don't add too much at once as essential oils are both powerful and expensive. You can also modify the color by adding food coloring. Always use natural coloring to avoid chemicals."
