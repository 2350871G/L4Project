      "description":"Now place your grated soap pieces into a metal pot. Then pour in about 2-3 tablespoons of water into every cup of grated soap. Then turn the heat onto medium, never turn it to high- soap can surprisingly burn. Stir your soap until it gets to a whipped cream like consistency."

      "description":"Now to the fun part. This is where you can be creative. You should add either scented oils (like lavender), fresh squeezed lemon or orange juice, the zest of an orange or lemon, or even pureed cucumber. You want to have around 3/4 the amount of oils, juices, zests, or puree to your soap. You can combine juices or zests or any other scent choice. Now stir the scents you want into you mixture an move to the side. Look online for other suggestions for scents if none of those tickle your fancy."
