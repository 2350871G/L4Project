          "description":"As is often the case with small bedrooms, there may only be 1 wall in your room that makes sense for the placement of the headboard or the head of the bed. Locate the wall that works best for this purpose and build your layout around it. This may be the wall across from the door, the wall with electrical outlets on either side, or the wall that positions your bed directly under the ceiling fan. With other placement options, you might not be able to access your closet or close your door without shimmying around it. Don\u2019t be afraid to put the head of your bed beneath a window if this seems like the best option for your room. Try not to overcomplicate the placement of your bed. Avoid setting it on an angle unless you\u2019re following an angled wall, since this will just eat up precious floorspace."

          "description":"If you want to be able to walk around all the sides of your bed, centering the bed along the wall with space left on either side may be the best choice. If you choose this option, try to keep the rest of your layout relatively symmetrical and balanced. This can be useful for 2 people who wake up at different times, since each person can comfortably roll out on their own side. It\u2019s also a good choice if you like being able to comfortably make the bed and change the sheets. A symmetrical layout works best for rooms with symmetry. If you have an offset closet door or an angled wall, consider an asymmetrical approach instead."

          "description":"Pick the most practical wall to press your headboard against, but instead of centering the bed along the wall, slide it over to one side. This may leave some extra space in front of your closet door, or it might allow you to squeeze a larger piece of furniture along the opposite wall. If you\u2019re worried about fitting in a heavy dresser into your space with a centered bed frame, or if your room is full of quirky angles, doors, or permanent fixtures, opt for asymmetry. Maintain floor space on either side of the bed for easier access."

This will leave the rest of the room open for other furniture items. You may want to choose the corner furthest from your bedroom door or any closet doors. Feel free to place your bed along a wall with a window. If there\u2019s any space left at the foot of your bed, take advantage of it!

Push the head of the bed along the wall beneath the low point of the slope. In most cases, this is practical because you\u2019ll be lying down and won\u2019t miss the lost headspace. Leave as much open floor space as possible beneath the higher parts of the ceiling so you can walk around without bumping your head. If you have an A-frame ceiling, try a symmetrical layout instead.

If you can, choose a smaller mattress and bed frame, such as a full-sized bed (also known as a double bed) or a twin bed, for your small bedroom. In a guest bedroom, consider using a sleeper sofa or a narrow daybed. These take up a smaller footprint and will make the room functional when you don\u2019t have guests. If you\u2019re really committed to maximizing the space in your room, mount a Murphy bed on your wall to keep the floor space open during the day. This type of bed rests on a hinge. It can be folded away to lay vertically against the wall or brought down to lay flat at night."

This strategy can also be used with a centered bed if you don\u2019t mind the asymmetry.

You can free up some floor space for larger, more functional pieces like dressers or wardrobes. Try using floor lamps or wall-mounted sconces to bring some lighting into your space, now that bedside table lamps aren\u2019t possible. Use a nearby windowsill for small storage, or utilize the top of your dresser for the typical nightstand contents.

Stick with full-sized furniture and use only the necessary pieces. If you\u2019re downsizing from a bigger space, know that you can\u2019t keep everything in your smaller bedroom.

If you sit up in bed and watch TV every night, mount your TV on the wall across from your bed so you don\u2019t have to strain your neck.

This can be a great strategy if you\u2019re renting a space with plain white walls. This bright, airy color palette works well for rooms that get plenty of natural light. If your room doesn\u2019t get a lot of natural light, add lighting fixtures throughout the room. Without sufficient light, an all-white room may feel dingy and claustrophobic."

Go for a color scheme of rich, deep tones on the walls, floors, and textiles to make the edges of your room recede. The dark color palette will be enveloping and cozy. Jewel-tones can be especially effective in small bedrooms. Try a warmer color palette of reds, purples, and warm neutrals to create a sultry effect, or consider a more soothing color palette with cool shades like navy blue or emerald green.
