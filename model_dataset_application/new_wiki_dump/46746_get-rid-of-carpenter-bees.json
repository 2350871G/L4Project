          "description":"Carpenter bees are notoriously sensitive to noise (which may in fact be a sensitivity to vibrations). Set up a boombox or loud speakers next to the area they've infested and play loud music for 2-3 days to encourage them to leave. This method is one of the safest and least bothersome means of getting rid of carpenter bees. There is a chance the bees might eventually return to the area of infestation after you dispel them with loud sounds. For best results, take preventive measures on the wooden structure as soon as the bees have all left. If you have neighbors who live close by, make sure you let them know you plan to use noise to get rid of your bee infestation before beginning this process. The loud music may be bothersome to them."

          "description":"Cut up the rinds of several different citrus fruits (orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit) and boil them in a shallow pot filled with water. Fill a spray bottle with the citrus-extract water and spray the carpenter bee burrows with it. Carpenter bees, like other insects, have a natural aversion to citrus oil (which is why the skin and rind protect the fruit on the inside \u2014 to keep it away from predators) and so will be particularly bothered by your citrus-extract spray. This spray won't kill the bees, but it will make them want to leave whatever wood they've built their nest in.

David Williams\t\t\tBeekeeper & Bee Removal Specialist\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: For a non-toxic way to get rid of carpenter bees, fill a spray bottle with soapy water, then spray that solution directly into the hole. That will kill the bee, and then you can seal the hole up to prevent moisture or other bees from getting in there."

          "description":"A very non-invasive means of getting rid of your bee infestation is to buy a bee trap and place it near the area of infestation. The trap will attract carpenter bees and prevent them from escaping, thereby slowly reducing the population of bees infesting your home. Hang your trap directly above the carpenter bee holes. If you don't have an infestation, hanging traps is also a good method of preventing one. You can find bee traps online, in pest control and home gardening stores, and in some department stores."

          "headline":"Use a tennis racket to kill carpenter bees when they're most active.",
          "description":"In the spring, carpenter bees fly around looking for burrows to lay eggs and deposit pollen as food for the larvae. This means they are very active for 2-3 weeks. Use a badminton or tennis racket to effectively smack and kill carpenter bees. If you want to ensure the bees are dead after you smack them, you can also step on them with shoes after they've been smacked to the ground. Because male carpenter bees are unable to sting and are the ones most likely to be buzzing around the nest, you're unlikely to be stung using this method. Note that this is NOT a preferred method of getting rid of your bee infestation, since carpenter bees are helpful pollinators that are necessary for the proper cultivation of many crops."

Use a hand duster to apply insecticidal dust directly into the carpenter bee holes to kill the existing bees and prevent further growth of the bee population. Apply the dust at night to minimize your chances of being stung. You should only have to apply insecticidal dust once per season. Recommended insecticidal dusts include Sevin and Delta Dust Insecticide."

There are a number of insecticides available for purchase anywhere you buy gardening equipment. Consider buying a residual insecticide and spraying them on the carpenter bee holes to get rid of your infestation. Some recommended insecticide sprays include Cyzmic CS, Demon WP, and FenvaStarCap. For best results, spray insecticide on the holes twice during the spring at intervals of roughly 3-4 weeks."

Use this method to avoid having to spray actual insecticides into your wood. Petrol and diesel are both flammable liquids. Make sure you don't use them near a source of ignition. Avoid getting petrol on your skin or inhaling its fumes. Wear an N-95 respirator, some goggles, and gloves when applying petrol to the holes. If using a spray bottle to spread petrol, be sure to label it and set it aside for petrol-only use in the future. You probably don't want to use the spray bottle to spritz your plants with water after using it to gas carpenter bees."

An aerosol carburetor cleaner that has an extension tube for the can will either kill bees instantly or discourage them from taking up residence in your home. Aerosol carburetor cleaner can be cheaply bought at any auto supply store. Be very careful to not get this in your face or eyes; wear protection and read the precautions for safety."
