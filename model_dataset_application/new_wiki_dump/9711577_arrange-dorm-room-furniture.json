          "headline":"Place your and your roommate\u2019s furniture in different areas.",
          "description":"If you share your dorm with another person, the easiest way to divide the space is by placing your furniture items in different areas of the room. If your dorm has a decent amount of space, try dividing the room into equal halves. If your dorm is pretty small, you may need to create more unique patterns out of your furniture by doing things like:\nMoving your beds to different corners of the room and building your space out from there. Placing your beds in the center of the room and using the walls as a shared space."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Segment the room using large furniture items.",
          "description":"If you have large furniture items like dressers, wardrobes, and bookshelves, don\u2019t simply press them against the wall. Instead, arrange them throughout the room so that they create makeshift borders. You can use this method to simply divide an area, like placing a shelf between your bed and desk, or you can surround an area with furniture items to create a miniature room. Many dorm rooms come with large, school-provided furniture items that can be easily transformed into makeshift walls."

          "headline":"Create temporary dividers using screens.",
          "description":"Screens provide the same level of segmentation as large furniture items, but you can easily rearrange them to suit your current needs. You can purchase specially-designed paper and cardboard screens at most discount and furniture stores, or you can repurpose old boards and panels into free-standing dividers. Some screens look like free-standing panels while others copy the design of traditional Japanese Shoji screens."

          "headline":"Make private areas within your room using curtains.",
          "description":"Dorm rooms are rarely designed with privacy in mind, so you\u2019ll have to create your own. Curtains provide great coverage around places like your bed, and you can even use them to conceal personal items like your laundry hamper or hygiene products. In lieu of professional curtains, try purchasing cheap cloth at thrift shops or craft stores. You can hang your curtains by attaching them to a curtain rod or tying them to hooks on the wall using string."

          "headline":"Get a loft bed to create an additional area.",
          "description":"At some colleges, you can request a loft bed instead of a standard floor bed. This will open up a lot of space beneath the bed that you can use as a private study or something similar. If you have a roommate, try placing their bed underneath your loft to divide the room more efficiently. If your college doesn\u2019t offer loft beds, see if they have stackable or bunk beds instead. If you\u2019d like to increase the privacy of this area, attach large curtains to the base of your bed so that they hang over the open space. For stackable or bunk beds, try hanging an additional curtain from the ceiling to create 2 private spaces. If you get a stackable or bunk bed, be aware that you\u2019ll have to make an agreement with your roommate about who sleeps on top and who sleeps on bottom."

If you own a television or similar entertainment device, place it in a common area so guests have a spot to flock to. If you don\u2019t, try placing chairs, couches, and similar items around a large table that way guests will naturally sit there. In addition to creating a place where you can spend time with friends, a common area will keep people from entering your more private spaces. If your room is too small to have permanent seating, try investing in butterfly chairs or similar furniture items that you can fold and put away when necessary."

If you live alone, push your dressers, shelves, and similar items together to create more room for guests.
