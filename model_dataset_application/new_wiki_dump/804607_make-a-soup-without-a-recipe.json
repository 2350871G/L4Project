  "text":" Find a pot large enough for the soup. A two quart (1.89 liter) pot is minimum, but 4-8 quarts (3.7 liters - 7.6 liters) would be best. Determine what ingredients you have on hand to decide what kind of soup you will make. Basic ingredients include meat, vegetables, grains, legumes, or fruit. Other potential ingredients include spices, herbs, acid (like vinegar or lemon juice), and fat (like butter or cream). Some basic soup styles include savory, sweet, or sour; hot or cold; heavy or light; cream or clear (consomm\u00e9). Divide your ingredients into those for the stock, and those for the finished soup. Decide if you will use dry beans or grains. Dry beans require pre-cooking, either by an over-night soak, or a 2 hour soak in water that is first brought to a boil, then turned off and covered. You can speed things up by using canned beans. Grains such as buckwheat or brown rice need up to an hour to cook (see the package for cooking time). Make Your Stock.
