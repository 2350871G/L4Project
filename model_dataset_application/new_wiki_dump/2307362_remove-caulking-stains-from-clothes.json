After a few days, you should be able to easily \"peel\" most of the goop off with your fingernails or a butter knife. Once the caulk is solid, carefully peel it off the article of clothing. The biggest chunk should come off in a glob. Alternately, use an ice cube. Hold an ice cube in place over the stain until it freezes.

Add more alcohol each time. Always use a clean section of the towel. If the towel becomes overly stained and saturated with caulk, you may need to switch to another rag."
