A large rug in a neutral color, like cream or beige, is great. If you want to incorporate a design, consider a floral pattern. Choose rugs made from natural fibers, like an animal-hide, or faux animal-hide, rug or a woven jute rug. A simple, striped rug is another choice."

Light yellow, off-white, sage green, and light blue are good color choices for cottage style bedrooms. Light blue is great for a beachy, cottage theme. Light yellow, beige, sage green, and off-white will work for almost any room."

Sponge on dark gray paint to create the stone texture. Then, remove the painter\u2019s tape. Finally, use a cheesecloth to refine the texture."

A nail gun can help you get the job done quickly.Spackle the nail holes then sand them down before painting over the shiplap or beadboard."

After that, mix acrylic glaze with white latex paint and apply it with a roller. Use the paint comb that comes in the kit by holding it at a 45-degree angle to create the veins in the paint. Last, use the heel of the rocker that comes in the kit to create the \u201cplanks.\u201d\nGo back and use the comb after you\u2019ve created the planks to vary the look of the planks.

Take the sandpaper and rub it over the paint until it looks as distressed as you\u2019d like it to be. Then, finish with wax or varnish. Use fine-grit sandpaper. A sandpaper with a rougher texture could do too much damage to the furniture. You only need to sandpaper gently. If you use the sandpaper with too much force, you could damage the furniture more than intended. Alternatively, you can use chalk paint to create a distressed look"

During the day, you can put thin, cotton curtains over the window that will filter the sunlight throughout the day. For the darker hours, look for light bulbs with a Kelvin temperature of 2700 or less for warm, soft lighting. It is also an option to light candles in place of lamps at night. Install a chandelier over your bed or vanity for a shabby-chic look."
