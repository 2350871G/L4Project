Tourmaline in particular usually has rounded edges, which means that the lines separating each face will be smooth and faint rather than sharp and angular.You\u2019ll be able to tell right away whether your specimen is prismatic as opposed to, say, banded, fibrous, geodic, or stalactitic."

Most tourmaline crystals have either a triangular or hexagonal cross section. If the stone you\u2019re investigating has any other shape, chances are good that it\u2019s something else.A typical tourmaline gem will look something like a pencil, with a long, narrow, 6-sided shaft. They may even taper to a slight point on one end. Just don\u2019t bother searching for an eraser!"

By comparison, steel-bladed knives only have a hardness rating of around 5-6. It\u2019s important to use a knife made from solid steel. If the blade is molded from a weaker type of metal, it could be susceptible to scratching even by minerals with a lower hardness rating."
