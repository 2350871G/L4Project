Finally, more expensive brands tend to taste better. If you're not sure where to start, try Medaglia d'Oro or Starbucks VIA Colombia. These tend to convert more coffee snobs than most brands.

If you live in a hard water area or your tap water just tastes bad, put it through a water filter first. If you don't have a kettle, microwave a mug of water before adding the coffee. Microwaved water can \"explode\" if overheated. Prevent this by putting a wooden popsicle stick or teaspoon of sugar in the cup."

Most importantly, use the same spoon and the same mug each time. If you switch to a different size each time, you can't pinpoint a ratio you enjoy. If there's no recommendation on the package, try 1 slightly rounded teaspoon (5mL) per 8 oz (240mL)."
