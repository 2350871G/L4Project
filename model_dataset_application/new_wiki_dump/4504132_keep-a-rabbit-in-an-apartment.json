      "description":"The idea that rabbits can happily live out their days in a 2'x3' cage and eat nothing but pellets and carrots is a myth that hurts and even kills a large percentage of pet rabbits. Rabbits require unrestricted and unlimited access to timothy hay (or alfalfa hay, if the rabbit is under a year old), which can be expensive and messy. Since rabbits eat a lot of food, they also go to the bathroom a lot, and while rabbit poop is not particularly gross (since they're herbivores), it does have a tendency to get everywhere and the rabbit's cage and litter box will need to be cleaned often. Rabbits also need space to run around, so you will have to either provide a fenced-in pen with sufficient space or rabbit-proof your apartment and let your pet run around for at least a few hours every day."

      "description":"A healthy rabbit can live for around 10 years; they are not a short-term commitment by any means. If you have children, take into account that rabbits are a lot more fragile and less cuddly than you may have been led to believe, and they are not appropriate \"starter pets\" for kids who don't know how to handle them. You will also have to clean up their living space at least every other day or so, and they tend to chew on things like furniture and carpet, which is annoying anywhere but can be particularly costly if you live in an apartment. That said, rabbits do make great pets, especially for people with limited space and time to deal with a larger animal like a cat or a dog. They are affectionate and entertaining. However, they do not like to be cuddled. They prefer to interact with you on their terms, that is, sitting on the ground. It will take awhile for you to gain their trust. Be patient. They also don't smell or make much noise, which makes them particularly great pets for apartment-dwellers."

Also, be sure to get your rabbit from a rescue organization instead of a pet store. Pet store rabbits may be cheaper, but they are often sold too young (resulting in them being timid, antisocial, and/or dangerous for most of their lives) and do not tend to live very long due to various breeding-related health issues. Additionally, a pet store will not usually give you time to get to know your potential pet, whereas rescue centers almost always do."

If at all possible, try to bring your new rabbit home in a car (as opposed to taking public transportation), as your rabbit will likely be scared and a bit stressed and loud, confusing places will not help. Don't make any unnecessary stops on the way home and make sure the car is not too hot; rabbits are very sensitive to heat and it will only exacerbate an uncomfortable situation. When you get back to your apartment, give your rabbit some hay and water, and leave it alone in a quiet environment for a few hours to settle in."

Rabbits like to go to the bathroom in corners, so this may be a good place to put your litterbox (and look out for messes there in the meantime).
