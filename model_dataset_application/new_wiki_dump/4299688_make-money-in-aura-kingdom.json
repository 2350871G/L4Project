If you get familiar with the market, you can buy low-priced items and then sell them at a higher price. You can find these Auction Houses in the Navea City and Guild House. To locate them, check your mini map for the $ sign. If you are in a guild, simply open your guild window and then press \"Guild Hall\" to teleport into your guild house (this is only available for players with that have guild level 4). Buying and selling requires patience, timing, and the ability to know the Aura Kingdom item prices. The Auction House is best for items that are not rare, as you will not lose out on profits due to the 10% commission."
