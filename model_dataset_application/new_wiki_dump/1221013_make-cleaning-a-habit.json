You can fix these problems, but that will take some time. Dealing with a huge mess of dirty laundry, candy wrappers, and lollipop sticks is torment. YOU didn't make this mess, so why should you have to clean it up? We all ask ourselves, \"_____ made this mess, not me! Why am I cleaning it up?\" The point is, sometimes, you have to just suck it up and clean it, whether you like or not."

If you do not have one or two of these items, now would be a good time to go purchase them. Before cleaning up the messes, get all the supplies."

If you have a mess in the living room, make sure all of your supplies are somewhere near the mess, just for the convenience of not getting up and down every 5 seconds to get a different supply. But sometimes, the best supplies are your bare hands. When working with a mold stain, always wear rubber gloves, to avoid being contaminated, or worse, getting mold spores in your air and ending up with mold in your lungs, which can kill you if a medical professional doesn't help immediately. Maybe save the mold for the experts. Getting the dirty clothes and candy wrappers out of the way is important. You need an open space so you can clean without having to try to shrink somewhat. Once that is out of the way, start!"
