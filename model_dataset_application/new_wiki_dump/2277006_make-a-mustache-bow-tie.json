Add a dab of hot glue around the perimeter of the mustache pattern. Add a drop of glue every half inch (1.3cm) around the perimeter of the pattern. Add a few drops in the middle of the pattern to ensure a smooth transfer. Only add a small amount of glue near but not on the edge of the pattern. This will reduce the likelihood the glue will spill over the edge."

If you don't have seamstress measuring tape, use a tape measure and wrap it around your shirt collar. Line the elastic up against the measuring tape and cut to size. Lay the elastic down next to your measuring tape and cut to size."

      "headline":"Sew the elastic band to the mustache.",
      "description":"The elastic band will hold your bow tie in place. Remember to place elastic underneath the shirt collar to hide it once the tie is in place. Lay the mustache felt side down on a flat surface. Lay the elastic band across the mustache, lengthwise, checking to be sure that the elastic sits evenly on both sides. Stitch the elastic in the middle of the mustache. Create a stitch that won't be overly obvious from the front of the mustache. If the cardboard or plastic you're using is thick, consider trying to just stitch the elastic to the cardboard and avoid hitting the felt."
