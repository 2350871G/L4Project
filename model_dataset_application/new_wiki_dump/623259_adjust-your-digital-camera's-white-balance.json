      "description":"Different kinds of lighting look the same to the human visual system (although once you, as a photographer, know that there is a difference, you'll look for and notice it everywhere!). Our brains compensate for it automatically, so that a white thing will look white under any light. But a subject in the shade is slightly bluer than the same subject in bright daylight, and incandescent lightbulbs are very orange compared to both.People who shoot film need to use coloured filters on their lenses (or use special films). A digital camera can digitally alter the colour information from its sensors to compensate for the different colours coming from various light sources. The setting which controls how and to what extent this is done is called the white balance. Apart from compensating for the colour conditions, though, the white balance control can be used to warm or cool colours for artistic effect. Most cameras have a white balance control, and will have all or some of the following settings:\n\n{\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/f\\/f5\\/White_balance_-_AWB_259.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/f\\/f5\\/White_balance_-_AWB_259.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":193,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":319.2,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>\\\"AWB\\\" white balance icon, I made this\\n<\\/p><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Public_domain\\\">Public Domain<\\/a> (ineligible for copyright protection)\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Automatic white balance.

As said, these settings are intended to compensate for bluer light, but you can use them to warm your colours, too. Cameras have built-in colour correction algorithms, not built-in artists; they don't know that your photograph should be warm. Use white balance trims to get your colours perfect. You might find, for example, that under certain kinds of indoor lighting your camera almost gets the white balance perfect in its \"Auto\" setting, but could do with being a little cooler, or that your sunsets would be perfect if they were a little bit warmer. This is where white balance trims (called \"hue adjustment\" on some cameras) come in: it allows you to take one of the camera's white balance presets, and adjust them slightly warmer or cooler to get perfect results. On all but the cheapest Nikon SLRs, you can do this by holding the white balance button and spinning the front control dial. Many cameras lack this adjustment entirely.",
