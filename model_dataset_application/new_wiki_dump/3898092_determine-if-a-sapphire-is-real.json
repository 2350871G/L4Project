          "description":"Gemologists can examine a sapphire and determine what kind of gem it is. They will give you a report on what they decide about the sapphire once they have analyzed it. They can tell you if it is natural or synthetic, treated or not, as well as many other attributes. Once the gemologists have fully examined the gem, they will give you an official statement. If you have an old family sapphire that you are sure is natural and valuable, it is good to have it certified to ensure that you get the best value if you sell it. A certified sapphire will be easier to sell for a good price.

Kennon Young\t\t\tMaster Gemologist Appraiser\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: The only way to be completely sure if a sapphire is real is to have it tested by a gemologist. They'll use instruments like refractometers, magnification, and polariscopes to evaluate the gem. Try looking up gemologists near you, or contact someone from a gemological organization such as the American Gemological Association."

Gems of equal hardness can\u2019t scratch each other, so if both are real sapphires then nothing will happen. If the real sapphire leaves a scratch on the second sapphire, then the second one is not real, or is at least of lower quality.
