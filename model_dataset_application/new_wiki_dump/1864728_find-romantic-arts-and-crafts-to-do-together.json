Buy two clear Mason jars, one for you and one for your partner, and colorful craft paper. Cut out rectangles to write on them.

Simply melt the wax in a double boiler and add fragrances or dyes of your preference. Put a wick in a glass or jar, holding it in the center, and fill the container with hot wax. Let the wax sit for 4 to 6 hours, and trim the wick down as needed. You can also use the candles you made for a romantic night later."

The easiest way is to buy a tie dye kit at a local craft store, and use different tying techniques to create different patterns. Perhaps the simplest is to tie the shirt into a knot and use a few rubber bands to hold it. Follow the instructions on the kit, mixing the dye with hot water in a bucket and soaking the fabric in it, typically for 4 to 10 minutes. Remove and rinse the fabric. You can also repeat this process for multiple colors, starting with the lightest color."

Start a tradition of writing love letters to each other. When it\u2019s your turn, set aside a time alone, contemplate on how you feel about your partner, and start writing your love letter. Send each other romantic poems that you have either written or taken from a famous poet. Set up a secret location for letter delivery\u2014just like in the book Little Women\u2014such as a box sitting in the living room display or one of the drawers in the bedroom. The secretive \u201cmailbox\u201d will add a clandestine and intimate element. Consider adding romantic treats with your letter such as a rose or a piece of decadent chocolate."

You can also add photos of you two from each place, or little notes referencing specific memories. Try sticking the map onto a corkboard and make it easier to pin down your destinations. You can also set goal destinations and pin them with a different color. Once you travel there, you\u2019ll have accomplished your goal and you can change the pin."

Clues could even begin while they are at work (for example, an email could tell them to walk to the car and find the first clue). Include fun inside jokes or stories as clues (such as referencing your favorite movie as a couple or the place where you had your first date). Sweeten the treasure hunt with a piece of candy, a bottle of wine or a rose along with each clue, and have a prize at the end with you waiting there. Set the tone for romance throughout the house by turning on soft music and dimming the lights. Light tea candles to line the walkway as your lover arrives and sprinkle rose petals throughout the house. Keep the activity short but sweet. Don\u2019t take them on a lengthy, wild goose chase."
