          "description":"Remove any oven racks, thermometers, or other removable elements from your cooled oven. Then apply baking soda to all stained surfaces of your oven's interior, paying particular attention to thick or greasy stain areas. Make sure that if you have used your oven recently, it is turned off and completely cooled before cleaning it with baking soda. Apply the baking soda liberally, up to \u00bc inch thick in areas that are stained. For the sides and top surfaces of the oven where you can't easily sprinkle on baking soda, add enough water to the baking soda to make a paste that can be spread on to the oven surface."

          "headline":"Apply water to the baking soda.",
          "description":"Lightly pour or spray water from a spray bottle onto the baking soda-covered surfaces of your oven. Use enough water to fully saturate the baking soda. A spray of water should be enough for a light layer of baking soda, while pouring on water may be needed for a thicker coating. The goal is for a paste-like consistency, with no dry powder but no pooled water either. You may also spritz plain white vinegar over the baking soda with a spray bottle. Take care if using this method, as the combination of vinegar and baking soda creates a chemical reaction that can be explosive in large quantities. Use only a spray bottle for vinegar in this case.

You can spritz the baking soda with water again if you find it has become dry, but otherwise you can leave the mixture alone until the next day. You'll find that the damp baking soda turns black or brown as it picks up the grease and stains from your oven. If you used a vinegar spray, the mixture will bubble. These signs are normal and show the effect of the baking soda in picking up food stains."

Sprinkle baking soda over the rack, spray on white vinegar, then let soak in hot water overnight. You can also scrub at the racks using baking soda and a wet sponge or toothbrush for smaller grates. It typically works best to soak before scrubbing. You can try soaking oven racks in a bathtub protected by old towels. Allow them to sit submerged in hot water with \u00bd cup of dishwasher detergent for 4 hours or overnight. This will loosen grime and make scrubbing easier, or in some cases not even necessary. Make sure to wipe down the racks with a clean damp cloth once treated with baking soda, soaked, or scrubbed, to ensure they are free from any residue before placing them back in the oven."

Simply let baking soda and water/vinegar sit overnight and wipe down in the morning. Remove grates if possible on a gas stove. Also note that you want to avoid allowing baking soda and water to drip down into the ignition area, so keep baking soda to a paste and apply carefully on gas stoves. Remember to wipe down the cooking surface thoroughly with a clean damp cloth once the baking soda and grime is removed, then let dry. A glass-top electric stove will smoke easily from any baking soda residue or other moisture when it is turned on."
