They do well in filtered sunlight, such as by a window that gets direct sunlight. Put a sheer curtain up so the houseplant gets just enough light. If you have a bright window spot available, this is the plant for you. It will bloom constantly and produce colorful blooms to brighten up any room. You should water African violets when the soil feels less moist with tepid water. Water these houseplants at the base and do not get any water on their leaves."
