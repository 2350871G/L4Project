Pairing Beer and Foods That Complement Each Other Find harmonies between beer and food. Pairing food with a beer that shares some of its flavor or aroma is a great place to start.

Foods such as aged Gouda, walnut cake, roasted pork, smoked sausage and cashew chicken will complement the malty flavor of a brown ale. Try pairing a stout with oysters. The coffee and chocolate flavors of a stout highlight silky, salty foods such as oysters on the half shell. A stout also pairs well with braised or caramelized meats and sauces.

Intensity of food flavors is all about richness, spicing, sweetness, texture, and complexity. Try matching foods heavy on sweetness or fattiness with contrasting flavors in beers like hop bitterness or roasted malt. Pair a bock with spicy foods. The flavor profile of a bock is rich and warm with caramel and toasty aromas. Balance this sweetness by pairing a bock with intensely flavored or spicy foods such as slow roasted meats, Cajun food, or jerk chicken. Pair an amber ale with smoked foods. Amber ales are known for their sweet caramel notes and citrusy aroma profiles. This is best contrasted by foods with a smoky flavor profile such as chili. Pairing Food with Beer That Cuts Intense Flavors Cut the intensity of food with a balancing beer flavor. Cutting intense heat, flavor, or richness of foods with an equally intense beer can allow strong flavors to mingle and even compete. If you\u2019re not a fan of intense beer flavors and aromas, you can cut the flavor of food with a beer whose flavor profile is on the opposite end of the intensity spectrum.
