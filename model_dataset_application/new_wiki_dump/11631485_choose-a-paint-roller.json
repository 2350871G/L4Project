          "description":"Choose a short-nap roller if you're painting a very smooth surface that could show streaks or imperfections, such as wood, walls, or metal. You should also select a short nap if you're painting smooth drywall or a surface with light texture. For a single-use roller, use a foam roller instead of one with woven or fabric nap. The foam will apply the paint without leaving streaks or lint."

          "description":"A \u20448 inch (0.95 cm) nap is a standard nap size, which makes it a good choice for most painting projects. If you're painting ceilings or interior walls, use this size since it will pick up more paint than a roller with a shorter nap and will fill in a slightly textured surface. If you're still unsure about which nap is right for your project, start with a \u20448 inch (0.95 cm) nap. If the roller is picking up too much paint for the job, move down to a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) nap."

These are great for painting metal doors, cabinets, or trim. Because foam rollers don't last very well after using and washing them, most are considered to be single-use."

For a longer-lasting cover, choose one that's a blend of polyester and wool. The wool helps the roller pick up more paint while the polyester prevents the roller from wearing out quickly.Tip: Although you can use a blended cover for oil paint, it's fine to use a natural cover made from mohair or sheepskin. These are more expensive and can't be used with latex paint, but they apply oil paint well. Synthetic covers don't pick up as much paint as a wool cover, but they last a long time when cared for properly."

          "description":"Brush your fingers over the roller material and pay attention to how loose or fluffy it feels. The material should feel tightly woven if it's a well-made roller. Don't buy a roller that releases lint or fibers when you brush it since these will end up in your paint. Keep in mind that it's easier to clean and reuse higher-quality rollers since the roller material won't fall away from the roller as easily."
