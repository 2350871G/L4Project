Avoid using cassava flour in recipes that require your food to rise like cakes.

For this reason, you'll want to measure your flour before you use it in a recipe using a digital scale. If you don't have a scale, the most accurate way to measure your flower is by fluffing it up and then scooping it using a measuring a spoon. This will prevent it from packing down.
