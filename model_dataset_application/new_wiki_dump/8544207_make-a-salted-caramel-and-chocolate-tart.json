Prick holes into the tart shell with a fork and bake for 25 minutes.  Making the Sauce Place the sugar into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Wait for it to turn a rich amber color. Remove the pan from heat. Whisk in butter and cream. The mixture will bubble, so be careful. Pour caramel into the cooled tart crust. Let it cool for 1 hour. Making the Chocolate Cream Chop the chocolate into small cubes.  Bring the heavy cream to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat.  Put the chocolate in a bowl and pour the cream on it.
