Use stevia drops in drinks (hot or cold), sauces, salad dressings, or soups. Stevia can have a bit of a bitter and/or licorice-y aftertaste. Experiment with the number of drops you need to gain optimal sweetness with minimal aftertaste."

Stevia extract powder is more potent than sugar, however. Use half (or less than half) of the amount of stevia as you normally would for sugar. Stevia extract powder can be used in drinks (hot or cold), on cereal, or in recipes. It can be purchased in large containers, or in individual packets you can take along with you.

This means you will need to add more bulk (such as flour) and liquid (such as milk, applesauce, or butter) to account for this difference.

This helps you to eliminate the presence of additives and save money. To sweeten a cup of hot tea, simply remove 1-4 small leaves from your plant and place them in hot water with your tea bag. Remove the leaves after several minutes. Although it has been used around the world for thousands of years, unrefined stevia leaf has not been approved as a food additive by the FDA. Before using stevia leaf in your food or drink, it is best to consult your doctor."

You can either pluck 8 or more leaves from your plant and place them between 2 paper towels, or simply remove an entire stevia stalk and hang it upside down. In either case, leave your stevia leaves in a cool, dry place for a few days. Then grind the dry leaves using a mortar and pestle. Use this green powder to sweeten drinks, breakfast cereal, or curries. 1 teaspoon of this stevia powder is equal to approximately 10 teaspoons of sugar.

Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the water is the consistency of syrup. Use a cheesecloth to strain out the powder. Store your stevia syrup in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. Use this syrup in cold drinks, fruit salads, or sauces. Remember that this sweetener will be more potent."
