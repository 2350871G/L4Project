Fasten the top of the box and tie a colorful ribbon around it for a creative touch. To determine the size box you'll need, measure the diameter of the compartments in your cupcake tin, then add 1 in (2.5 cm) so the cupcakes don't touch. For instance, if your tin makes a 3 inches (7.6 cm) cupcake, you would need 4 in \u00d7 4 in (10 cm \u00d7 10 cm) of space for each cupcake. If you're going to be carrying more than 1 cupcake in each box, you can create a makeshift insert for added stability. Cut squares of card stock that are slightly larger than the cupcakes. Cut a notch into each corner, then fold down each side so the card stock sits slightly raised. Then, cut an X into the center of the card stock for the cupcake to sit in. If the cupcakes are a gift, place gift tags on each box and write the person\u2019s name or a short message."
