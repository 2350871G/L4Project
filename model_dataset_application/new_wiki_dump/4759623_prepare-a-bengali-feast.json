The rest of it gets cooked on dum (when you layer the chicken and rice, seal it and put on a very slow fire). Take a big deep wide mouth vessel, add lots of water (at least 10 times more than rice). Add ample salt (this is very important because the rice needs to be salty when cooked). Also add a cinnamon stick, a couple of green cardamoms, a few cloves and the rest of caraway seeds (shahi jeera), for flavoring the rice. Boil all this for a few minutes on a high flame (7 minutes or so). Check for readiness. This is how to check if the rice is done. Without burning your fingers, take a few grains of rice (use a clean spoon to take some out of the boiling water), break a grain, if it breaks into 3 parts easily, the rice is done. Strain the rice and spread it on a clean surface (a tray or something), so that it cools faster. If you want to pick out the whole spices which you added, you can do that now.

  "text":" Dessert Start with Bengali desert because it is easy to make. This recipe is for Sandesh [\u201cshon-daesh\u201d], which is a sweet treat that can be seen at any Indian celebration in a Bengali household. Traditional Sandesh calls for two separate recipes \u2013 the making of the paneer (cheese) and then the recipe for the dessert, where you mix in the fresh cheese with the rest of the ingredients. Cook Time: 20 - 30 minutes\nCooling Time: 2-3 hours. Assemble the ingredients. For making sandesh, the ingredients are:\n2 quarts whole milk\n\u00bc cup of lemon juice (or lime juice)\nFresh paneer from 2 quarts of milk\nA handful (approx. 8-12) each of almonds and pistachios cut into slivers\nA few saffron strands\n1 tablespoons warm milk (to soak saffron)\n1/2 milk powder\n1/2 cup powdered sugar (or regular, granulated sugar)\n1/2 tsp cardamom powder\n1 teaspoon rose water\nGhee (or butter) to lightly grease molds\nOptional additions: pistachio essence (1/2 teaspoon), for flavor. Assemble the items needed as well. These are:\nLarge heavy bottom pan\nCheesecloth\nMolds of any shape you like (a leaf is a traditional holiday shape). Heat the milk in the pan until just before it boils. Then turn off the heat. Do not overcook the milk. Add lemon juice (or citrus substitute) one tablespoon at a time.  Stir the milk constantly while adding the lemon juice. The solid curds will separate from the liquid whey. Place the cheesecloth in a strainer. Strain out the whey from the curds. Allow the curds to cool for at least 15 minutes. During this time, begin prep for the sandesh. Use the cheesecloth to squeeze out any excess moisture. Set aside and begin mixing the ingredients for the dessert. Soak the almond and pistachio slivers with the saffron in warm milk. Keep aside to use as topping. If the nuts do not soak up all the milk by the time you are ready to use them, drain it away before you use the nuts as topping. Combine the sugar, milk powder and paneer and mix well.  Place on a medium-low flame, folding the doughy mixture continuously for 4-5 minutes in the pan.  When the mixture becomes slightly more solid in texture, splash the rose water on it and remove the pan from the heat. Stir a few more times. Allow the mixture to cool.  Add sugar and cardamom powder and mix until smooth dough is formed. If using pistachio essence, add in with the sugar and cardamom powder\nIf using pistachio essence, add in with the sugar and cardamom powder. Lightly grease the molds with ghee (clarified butter).  Put a little topping mixture (soaked almonds, pistachios and saffron strands) in each mold.  Press some of the prepared paneer mixture on top of the topping in each and shape into the mold.  Chicken curry for main course Assemble the ingredients: 1 chicken or its equivalent Water 1 onion, finely chopped salt, according to taste Fresh coriander (about half a bunch) 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon a teaspoon of turmeric powder 2 tablespoons of tomato puree 2 tablespoons of cumin powder 1 teaspoon crushed ginger A pinch of crushed garlic. Use 1 kilogram of chicken with or without bones. Chop into desired pieces, either large, medium or into smaller pieces. Add into a pot containing 1 glass of water. Allow to cook for 15 minutes until the natural oils from chicken mixes with the steamed water. Add the onion into this mixture. At the same time, add salt according to taste. When chicken appears to be half cooked, add fresh coriander.  Add the cinnamon, turmeric powder, tomato puree, cumin powder, crushed ginger and garlic.  Turn down the heat slightly, as the above spices will need to blend into the chicken mixture, while it cooks into the chickens own natural oils. If required, add half a glass of water to avoid burning the spices. Once the mixture obtains a smooth consistency, mix thoroughly to get an even consistent blend.  Allow to simmer until chicken is completely cooked.  Add the required amount of water while cooking, if one desires to add gravy to this dish.  Garnish with one diced tomato(fresh), five minutes before switching off the cooker.  Check the salt content. Adjust if necessary. Serve. This delicious dish serves 4 to 6 people. Making the chicken biryani (main meal) Obtain the following ingredients: 1 kilo of chicken on the bone cut into 8-10 parts 1 tablespoon of ginger garlic paste 1 teaspoon of coriander powder 1 cup of card or milk with one lemon juice 1 tablespoon garlic paste 1 teaspoon biryani masala (2 cardamom,1 inch cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon fenugreek, 3 cloves - take all these, fry them without oil, make them into a powder) A pinch of salt. Mix all of the above ingredients together. Let the chicken marinate for 6 to 12 hours in the refrigerator, the more the better. Prepare the herbs, spices and condiments. Mix together as follows:\n8 cloves\n1 cinnamon stick\n6 green cardamoms\n2 bay leaves1\n2 teaspoons shahi jeera (caraway seeds)\nA few pinches grated nutmeg and mace each\n1 teaspoon coriander powder\n1 teaspoon red chili powder (to taste)\n1 tablespoon garam masala powder\n5-6 tablespoons of chopped fresh mint\n2-3 chopped green chilies\n4-5 chopped tomatoes\nA whole bunch of fresh coriander leaves\n1 inch piece of ginger root, grated\n1 kilo basmati, jasmine or ganador rice\n1 cup tomato paste (not tomato sauce)\n1 cup milk, cream, or yoghurt Assemble the fried onion ingredients. The ingredients needed are:\nAbout 8-9 medium size onions\nOil for deep frying\n3-4 tablespoons for cooking\n1 tablespoon of ginger garlic paste\n1/2 cup of milk\nA few strands of saffron (kesar)\nDesi ghee (clarified butter), about 6-7 tablespoons\nCashew nuts (a few or as many as you want)\nRaisins and almonds are optional\nSalt to taste Deep fry the onions. While the chicken is marinating, slice the onions thinly. You can use a food processor for this or a slicer. Heat oil and fry the sliced onions in batches. The heat should be medium. Definitely not high, otherwise the onions will get burned. Stir the onions continuously for uniform browning. When they become light brown, drain them on kitchen paper. Keep them aside. They will get nice crispy as they cool down.Ad Cook the chicken. Take a deep, wide mouth vessel and heat 3 to 4 tablespoons of oil in it. In this, add the bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, cardamoms, little bit of shahi jeera and allow to crackle. Add a tablespoon of ginger garlic paste and stir a little. Tip out all the marinated chicken and the marinade. Cook on a high flame so that the water gets evaporated quickly. Add the chopped tomatoes, mint, green chilies, all dry powders( coriander, chili), and salt. Cook till the chicken is cooked and the gravy (masala) is not watery. Add one third of the fried onions. Mix well. Keep aside. Parboil the rice. Boiling rice is one of the most important part of cooking a biryani. The rice needs to be parboiled, meaning that it should be three fourth cooked. The rest of it gets cooked on dum (when you layer the chicken and rice, seal it and put on a very slow fire). Take a big deep wide mouth vessel, add lots of water (at least 10 times more than rice). Add ample salt (this is very important because the rice needs to be salty when cooked). Also add a cinnamon stick, a couple of green cardamoms, a few cloves and the rest of caraway seeds (shahi jeera), for flavoring the rice. Boil all this for a few minutes on a high flame (7 minutes or so). Check for readiness. This is how to check if the rice is done. Without burning your fingers, take a few grains of rice (use a clean spoon to take some out of the boiling water), break a grain, if it breaks into 3 parts easily, the rice is done. Strain the rice and spread it on a clean surface (a tray or something), so that it cools faster. If you want to pick out the whole spices which you added, you can do that now. Or else just let them be. Keep all these ready. Now that the rice and chicken are cooked and the fried onions are ready, you just need to get a few more things organized, so that the layering can be done. Chop the coriander leaves. Boil the milk and add crushed saffron in it. Give it a stir. In desi ghee, fry the cashew nuts till golden brown. Also the almonds and raisins, if using. Keep aside. Keep some melted desi ghee aside. Take a heavy bottom pan with a lid (non stick is best). Take some melted ghee and grease the bottom of the pan with it. Then put a layer of rice, then a layer of chicken followed by a layer of fried onions. Then a layer of chopped coriander. Repeat and finish off with the rice layer. Lastly, sprinkle the leftover fried onions (if any), cashews and other nuts. Pour the saffron milk on top. Also pour some desi ghee down the sides of the pan and some on top of the rice. It will trickle down with the heat. Done. Seal the lid by sticking it with some chapati dough or simply fix a big foil before placing the lid. The idea is to restrict the steam from escaping. Place this pot on a very slow flame. Ideally place this vessel on top of another flat pan or tawa, so that the bottom of the pan doesn't come in direct contact with the heat source. Leave for one hour. When you open it, what you get is the magical, flavorsome and aromatic chicken biryani. Dig in. Don't forget to prepare a raita while your biryani is cooking. Enjoy hot biryani with a cold raita. Fry the cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and onion in the pressure cooker pot and cook until it is fried to a golden colour.  Add the ginger and garlic. After a minute of mixing, add the coriander leaves & mint leaves. Then add tomatoes, chicken, salt, and other spices. Add the amount of uncooked rice you want to use along with the required amount of water (usually twice the amount of rice) - stir this mixture using a long spatula to mix everything together, then close the lid of the cooker and wait for the whistle. After the pressure is fully released, open the lid, stir the biriyani without spoiling the rice and serve with raitha.

Open and serve. After the pressure is fully released, open the lid, stir the biriyani without spoiling the rice and serve with raitha. Making hilsa (fish) korma (main meal) Assembler the needed ingredients. They are:\nHilsa\nCurd\nGinger paste\nOnion paste\nGreen chilli paste\nSalt\nSugar\nGhee\nBay leaf\nCardamom\nCloves\nWild cinnamon Take the body of the fish, except for the head and tail.  Wash the fish. After washing the body, marinate it with a paste made of the curd, ginger, onion, chilli, salt and sugar. Heat the ghee in a pan and put a bay leaf, cardamom, wild cinnamon.  Put the marinated fish into the pan.  Pour \u00bc cup of water and cover it.  Cook it in low flame. It will boil within 10 minutes. It's then ready to serve. Making the baingan bhaja (side dish or appetizer) Assemble the ingredients. They are:\n1 big purple brinjal/eggplant/aubergine\n1 teaspoon chili powder\n2 teaspoons rava\n1 tsp rice flour\n1/2 teaspoon sugar\n1 teaspoon jeera powder\n1 teaspoon dhania powder\nSalt to taste\nMustard oil. Cut the eggplant lengthwise.  Rub in salt, turmeric and sugar.  Keep aside for 30 minutes to one hour. This removes the bitterness from the eggplant. Heat the mustard oil in a frying pan.  Lay the eggplants down in the oil.  Turn the sides to cook evenly on both the sides.  Serve hot.  Cut the brinjal/eggplant into around 1/2\" slices and drop it in a bowl of water for around 15 minutes.  Drain the water and wipe all the slices dry.  Mix all of the masala ingredients, along with rava, in a mixing bowl.  Apply this mixture on the both sides of all the brinjal slices.  Heat little oil in frying pan.  Place the brinjal slices in the pan. Shallow fry the slices. Brinjal absorbs oil so care should be taken not to use lot of oil while frying. Turn the slices around & fry till they turn brown on both sides.  Garnish with coriander leaves on cooked slices and relish. Serve as an appetizer.",
