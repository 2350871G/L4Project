Multiply this number by a standard multiplier, which is 7.5 for rectangular and square pools and 5.9 for other shapes. Example: 16*32*5*7.48 = 19,149. This would give the volume of the pool in gallons for this 16x32 inch pool that has an average depth of 5 feet. If your pool has different areas of depth to it, calculate the volume of each area of depth before adding them all together to find the total volume of your pool."

You can estimate your pool plumbing resistance to be 20ft/lbs for small pools, and 40ft/lbs for large pools or installations where the pool pump is far removed from the pool area. The pump manufacturer can tell you the flow rate for certain resistances. An average 1 HP pump will move about 50 gallons per minute. This would be 3,000 gallons per hour."

Use this equation to see how long you should run your filter: (Pool Volume \u00f7 Filtration rate) x 2 = Hours to run filter. This will tell you how many hours to run your pump to filter the water a full 2 times. For example, using a pool volume of 19,149 gallons and a filtration rate of 3,000 gallons per hour:\n(Pool Volume \u00f7 Filtration rate) x 2 = Hours to run filter\n(19,149 \u00f7 3000) x 2 = 12.766, or about 12 hours and 45 minutes for a full 2 cycles."

You can run it on its lower settings normally, and then on the higher settings when you\u2019re adding the chlorine or other cleansers to the water. This way, you\u2019ll be ensuring you\u2019re filtering out the entire contents of your pool at least 2 times a day. If you have a small filter, you will need to run the filter longer depending on how many gallons the filter can process in a given time. Don\u2019t worry about running it for too long, it\u2019s better to overrun your filter than not run for long enough."
