      "description":"There is usually no better place to hold your child's birthday party than your own home. Children are usually better behaved in the home environment and much easier to control. It's always wise to make sure any valuable items are stored away in case of accidents. Also, outdoor parties can be a lot of fun, whether it's held in one of the local parks or simply in your own backyard. If you feel your house is too small to accommodate the number of children you are planning to invite, then booking a local hall is a sensible option. Choose carefully and try to find one that has a carpeted floor. When holding your party in a hall, be sure to make a thorough checklist of everything you will need to take with you for the party (Don't forget your music, prizes, matches or a lighter to light the birthday cake candles with!). Shows at a local restaurant can also be a great option for certain families."
