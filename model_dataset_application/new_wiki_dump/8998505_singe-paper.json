Using a Candle or Lighter Select a piece of uncoated paper. Any piece of paper that\u2019s shiny or very bright white probably has a coating on it. This makes it more aesthetically pleasing for printing purposes, but makes it more difficult to achieve a natural, singed look. Choose a piece of paper that\u2019s designed for painting, watercolors, or charcoal drawing and has fibers that you can clearly see. Light a candle or turn on a lighter.
