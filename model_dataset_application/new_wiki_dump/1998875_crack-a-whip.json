With the whip held firmly in your dominant or writing hand, bring your arm up straight up to the 12 o'clock position, as if you were pointing at the sky. Keep your elbow locked on the up motion, keeping your arm straight. To crack the whip, let your elbow bend naturally and snap your arm down firmly in front of you, keeping the whip clear of your body. Practice bringing the whip up smoothly, and letting the weight of your arm falling do most of the work. It shouldn't be an abrupt or jerky motion, it should follow the natural motion of your arm."

          "description":"The reason the whip cracks is because one part of the whip is traveling in one direction along a straight plane while the other end of the whip is traveling in the opposite direction. This is called the loop. When you bring the handle of the whip straight up, at the apex, the end of the whip will still probably be close to the ground and traveling up. As you bring the handle down, the end of the whip moves toward the point where the handle used to be, and will \"crack\" as you abruptly change direction. Maintaining this loop is essential to making good whip cracks. It helps to make sure you've got the whip in the right starting position."

Whether vertical or horizontal, your arm and the whip need to be in a straight line to get that distinctive cracking sound from the whip. If you're having trouble getting the whip to crack, make sure you're bringing the whip up high enough on the initial up motion."

Your starting position for this whip crack needs to have the whip laid out in front of you, rather than behind you."

This crack can be used as part of a combination crack. After bringing the whip forward, adjust your footing to stand straight up and bring the whip back over your shoulder to complete a second forward crack. This looks and sounds more complicated than it is. Be careful not to bring the whip back into your face if you attempt this."

Start the crack as you would the forward crack, bringing your arm up, but keeping your arm flexed, rather than perfectly locked and straight. Flex your wrist backward at 12 o'clock position to strike the whip straight out, rather than straight down."
