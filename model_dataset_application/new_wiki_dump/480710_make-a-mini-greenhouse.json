          "description":"You can use a simple 1 liter plastic bottle to make a variety of greenhouses. These are ideal for growing a single, short, shallow-rooted plant. Examples would include an orchid, a small fern, or a cactus. Look for bottles in a variety of shapes, as this can give you more customization options. To make a complex soda bottle greenhouse, begin with two bottles. One should be slightly wider than the other if possible. Carefully cut the top off of the thinner bottle, just past the point where it curves to form the tube section. Cut as straight and clean as possible. Use hot glue to attach the opening of the bottle top you just cut to the bottom of the remainder of the bottle. This will form a vase-like base for your mini greenhouse. Smooth any rough edges so that it sits evenly on a table. Next, make the lid for the greenhouse by cutting the top off of the wider bottle, maybe a centimeter below where the top curves into the tube section. The top of this bottle then becomes a lid for the thinner bottle to which you glued the base. If using this style, be sure to put the proper growing materials at the bottom of your greenhouse. This style does not have drainage and will have to be treated more like a terrarium. A simpler method would be to cut the bottom from a 1 liter bottle and simply push the upper portion into the dirt or over a small pot but this will not look as nice as the method described above."

It will, however, need to be reasonably tube-like in shape (if going over a pot or making a vase structure). This bottle can accommodate up to three small plants of the same varieties used with the 1 liter jars. You can also use this bottle to create a base which drains, by puncturing the bottom and cutting 1\u201d vertical lines into the bottom edge of the lid. Be sure to leave at least 1\u201d of jar above the desired dirt line when cutting for the lid. This will keep the dirt from falling out when the bottle is opened."

Mason jars come in a variety of sizes and should be chosen appropriate to the size of the plant you intend to grow. Simply fill it with growing materials appropriate to a terrarium and you will have a beautiful tiny greenhouse."

It will depend on the size and number of the plants you intend to grow. A small plant in a bed can simply be covered with an upside-down, wide opening fishbowl. A right-side up fishbowl can be used like a terrarium, either covered with plastic or left open at the top. A large tank can be treated as a terrarium with no drainage, holes can be drilled in the bottom to provide drainage, or (if it has a glass bottom) it can be flipped upside-down to form a greenhouse. If left right-side up, a lid will need to be created from plastic wrap or using the wood-frame method described below."

Attach the frames together by drilling a small hole through the inside edge of the larger frame and half-way into the smaller frame. Then use a screw of a size corresponding to the hole you drilled to join the frames securely. Continue joining the frames until you have a rectangle formed by the four largest frames (both 11\u201dx14\u201d frames and bother 8\u201dx10\u201d frames)."

A hinge will be attached to allow you to open the greenhouse to water the plants inside. Place two of the 5\u201dx7\u201d frames side-by-side, so that the short ends are touching. Then join them together by screwing 2\u201d mending plates at each end of the joined edge. Drilling pilot holes first will make this easier. Repeat process with the other two 5\u201dx7\u201d frames.

You may be able to simply place it on top but joining it to the rest of the frame will be more secure. Be sure to eliminate large gaps by finding a filler for the ends of the roof. Join the roof to the structure by attaching two 1\u201d utility hinges, evenly spaced, along the edges to be joined. Fill the triangular gap with material cut from the backing of the larger frame, plywood, foam, or another other material you think appropriate. Plywood or foam would need to be accordingly thick, to make them easier to attach to the frame. Whatever material you choose, simply trace the inside of the triangular end (if using plywood or foam) or the outside edge (if using the backing of the frame) and glue into place. The plywood can be nailed if desired."

Replace the glass from the inside of the greenhouse and attach it by hot gluing the corners. Once the glass is in, seal all the edges with more hot glue. You can even use plastic instead of glass frame."

This will give your greenhouse greater stability and strength. Use relatively thin PVC pipe, no more than 1.5\u201d wide. A good size to use would be closer to \u00be\u201d.

When you are done, you should have a horizontal rectangle or square base with posts coming up from the T joints at regular intervals.

Form the central roof structure by creating a line of PVC pipe identical to one long side of the base. The pieces should be connected with four-way joints at the same intervals as your wall posts, except for the ends which will be capped in T joints. From the T joints and four-way joints, place short sections of pipe and cap them in 45\u00b0 joints. Next, place 45\u00b0 joints at the top of each of your wall posts. After that you will need to measure how much pipe you need to join the 45\u00b0 joints of the wall to the 45\u00b0 joints of the central roof structure.
