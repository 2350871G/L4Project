In most areas, running the vineyard on a downhill, southern facing slope, is ideal. However, in climates that regularly achieve temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius) you may want to choose a northern facing slope to protect grapes from extreme heat.

These systems are essential because the vine cannot support the full weight of the fruit it produces. Trellises can be a simple series of wires, decorative fencing, or more decorative options, depending on your needs. Fencing companies typically offer trellising services at minimal costs, and they have the experience to design and place a system that will support your vines. Consult with a landscaper or nursery specialist if you would like to build your own trellis system.
