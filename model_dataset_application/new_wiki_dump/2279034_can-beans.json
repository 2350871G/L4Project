This method is the best for ensuring the beans absorb enough water to cook evenly all the way through. Quick soak: bring the pot of water and beans to a boil, then turn off the burner and let soak 1 hour. This will do the job much faster, but the beans won't cook as evenly. The beans will expand as they absorb water, so leave space in the pot. Broken and split beans will rise to the water's surface. Remove these."
