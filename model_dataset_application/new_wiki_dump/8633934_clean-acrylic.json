Instead, use air or water to remove dirt before you begin to clean. You can use canned air to blow dirt off of the windows, or drip water onto the surface that picks up the dirt and allows you to float it off. If you use water, blot the window dry with a microfiber cloth after the dirt has come up."

Simply repeat the process of dropping water onto the surface of the acrylic and blot it dry with a microfiber cloth. Don\u2019t rub the window with the microfiber cloth as this can cause scratches in the acrylic."

Simply sand the acrylic surface the same way you would with a piece of wood \u2013 start with a coarser sand paper and once you\u2019ve worked over the entire surface, move to a finer paper and repeat the process. Using a buffer after you sand acrylic can give your acrylic an extra shiny finish. This technique should only be used on unfinished acrylic or if your acrylic windows have suffered extreme damage from storms."
