  "text":" Making the Dough Place the butter and confectioner's sugar in a mixing bowl.  Mix the ingredients together using either a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Beat them for 15 minutes or until the mixture begins to turn white. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, followed by the brandy. Beat for another minute. Mix 3 cups of flour, baking powder and baking soda in a bowl using a whisk.  Pour 1 cup of the dry mixture into the wet ingredients, beating the mixture until the dry ingredients are incorporated.  Repeat in 1 cup intervals until all of the dry mixture is combined with the wet ingredients. If the dough is too soft, add the additional flour in increments until the dough is semi-firm. Fold the chopped almonds into the dough using a flat plastic spatula.  Preparing the Cookies Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180\u00b0C). Spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray and then cover the baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll a tablespoon of dough into a ball and place the ball on the baking sheet. Add additional balls of dough, leaving 1\" (2.5 centimeters) of space around each ball of dough on the baking sheet. Push the dough balls down with your palm to flatten them slightly. You want to ensure that the center of the dough is higher than the edges. Bake the cookies for 20 to 25 minutes, until they just turn golden.  Remove the baking sheet from the oven and place it on the stovetop.  Sprinkle the cookies with rose water or orange flower water and then cool the cookies for 2 minutes.  Remove the cookies from the baking sheet with a spatula and place the cookies on a wire rack sitting atop a sheet of parchment paper.  Pour confectioner's sugar into a sieve and position the sieve over the top of the cookies.  Tap the edge of the sieve, which will sift the confectioner's sugar through the mesh, so that it can dust the cookies. Dust each cookie generously with the confectioner's sugar. Repeat the process with another baking sheet full of cookies until you have baked all of your dough.  Finished. ",
