Small to mid-size audiences are well-served with a 2000-lumen projector, while larger audiences (100+) require a 3000-lumen projector for crisp, clear image projection."

If you\u2019re presenting indoors, odds are there will be at least some ambient light (to assist your attendees in note-taking, finding their way out of the room to take a call or use the bathroom, and to help you maintain eye contact with the participants). Generally speaking, if the room is exceptionally dim (almost completely dark), then a low-lumen projector would suffice. Most presentation environments feature dimmed ambient light, which makes a 2000-lumen projector a wise choice."
