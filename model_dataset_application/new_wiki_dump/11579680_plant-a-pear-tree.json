This allows your tree to take root at the beginning of the growing season. Bare-root stock trees are dormant, so you can hold them in your home as long as you need. Additionally, they can be planted from late-autumn to early spring."

Choose an area that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight. If you\u2019re planting 2 trees, look for at least 2 good spots that are at least 20 ft (6.1 m) away from each other."

Then, follow the directions to test your soil pH. If it\u2019s not between 6-7, make soil amendments to get the proper pH. If your soil is above a 7, add organic matter like peat moss, decomposed leaves, or pine needles to lower the pH. If your soil is below 6, add about a cup (220 g) of dolomite or quick lime to raise the pH."

For pollination, plant 2 or more different types of pear trees within 200 ft (61 m) of each other. Make sure that the trees are at least 20 ft (6.1 m) apart so they don\u2019t compete for resources. For instance, a Bartlett pear tree will work well with a Bosc, Anjou, or Kieffer pear tree because they blossom at the same time. All of these varieties can be mixed or paired with another tree that\u2019s the same type. A Bradford pear tree will pollinate other pear trees but won\u2019t produce edible fruit."

Container pear trees cannot grow to full-size, so it\u2019s important that you get a tree that\u2019s grafted onto roots for a smaller tree. Often, these trees are labeled with a \u201cC\u201d for container. Make sure the tree you pick says it can be grown in a container.

You want a container that\u2019s just big enough to support a small pear tree. This way the root system won\u2019t grow too large, which can affect the overall look of your ornamental pear tree.
