Repeat the same process on the colander\u2019s other handle. Place sheet moss inside the colander to line it. Fill the colander with potting soil, then plant ferns and pansies inside. Attach four lengths of twine to the colander handles, then use the twine to hang the colander in a sunny spot."

          "description":"To complete this project, you will need a pair of old rain boots, a metal grommet, some burlap ribbon and two cylindrical vases. Install a grommet into the back of  each boot, using a hammer. Thread a piece of burlap ribbon through both grommets. Place a 3-inch-wide vase in each boot and fill the vases with flowers. If the vases seem unstable, pack the bottom of the boots with tissue paper. Tie the ends of the ribbon into a knot, then hang the display from a nail in your front door. Grommets can be purchased at any hardware store."

Place the square pattern side up, then fold three of the corners inward, towards the square\u2019s center. Sew the three sides together to create a pouch that looks like an envelope. Turn the sachet inside out and press it with an iron. Sew a button on the flap (this will be strictly decorative). Pour dried lavender or other dried flowers into the pouch, then sew the flap shut."

Use sewing scissors to remove any excess fabric, then sew the doily around the vase, making sure it fits snugly. Use a clear glass for a more elegant looking vase. Try using a blue glass vase paired with an off-white handkerchief for a more modern take on this project. Fill the vase with flowers and use it to brighten up your kitchen."

Cut a buttonhole using scissors on the opposite end of the strip. Loop the bandana strip around a rolled up white napkin and button the strip to secure it in place."
