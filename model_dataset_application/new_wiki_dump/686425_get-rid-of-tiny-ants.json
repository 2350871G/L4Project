          "description":"Ants come into your home for two main reasons: to find food to bring back to the colony, and to seek shelter from cold weather conditions. Ants could enter your home from many different areas, so be sure to check around window cracks, door entryways, lighting fixtures, and other possible entrances. If you see a trail of ants in your home, follow them to see where they are entering from. If you find specific entry points where ants are coming into your home, focus your repellant and deterrent efforts on these areas. That way, you reduce the chances of the ants reentering you home through these avenues."

Consider filling in cracks and crevices with a silicone caulk treatment. You could even put some sort of deterrent (Borax, cinnamon, coffee grounds, bay leaves) in the crack, and then continue to seal the opening with caulk. Latex and siliconized acrylic caulks are not effective when trying to seal ant entryways, because ants can break down these caulking treatments."

          "description":"Consider creating a barrier around your house or garden to prevent ants from entering. Scatter coffee grounds around the foundation of your house, along the perimeter of your garden, and along any sites where you have noticed ant trails or a lot of ant activity. Consider keeping mint or chili pepper plants around your house or planting them in your garden. These plants are known to keep intrusive ants at bay. You could also lay down a ring of food grade diatomaceous earth around the perimeter of your house or garden. Sprinkle this powder near from your home\u2019s foundation or garden, and try to sprinkle a ring around known anthills and nests. Diatomaceous earth breaks down the ants\u2019 exoskeleton and causes them to dehydrate. DE is non-toxic to humans, but try your best not to directly breathe in powder particles. Commercial insecticides can be used on the outside of your home, but bear in mind that insecticides are usually dangerous to humans, pets, and sometimes the environment."

Simply create a solution of dish soap and water, and use a sponge to wipe away the trail as well as some of the surrounding area. That way, the ants will no longer have a scented trail to follow each other into your home. You could also use vinegar to remove scented trails. Simply spray white vinegar over areas known for a lot of ant activity, and wipe down surfaces where you have seen ants before."

Kevin Carrillo\t\t\tMMPC, Pest Control Specialist\t\t\t\tPepper-based compounds can help deter ants, but it's still best to treat them at the nest. If you can find products that are piperonyl-based, which is basically a type of pepper, those can work as an irritant to the ant's exoskeleton. However, ants are very communicative, so if one or two ants come into contact with an irritating substance, they're going to use pheromones to mark off that area. Other ants who come to that area will just go around it. That's why the best approach is generally to remove their food and water sources and use a granular bait to treat the colony at the nest."

          "description":"Borax is a cleaning chemical that is poisonous to ants, but non-toxic to humans. To try and kill the ants at their source, make a Borax bait that the ants will flock to, and bring back to their nest. Mix one part corn syrup (or any sweet, sticky substance) with one part Borax, and spread the mixture on an index card. Place the index card in an area where you have witnessed a lot of ant activity. The ants will bring this sweet, poisonous mixture back to their colony, and it will slowly eliminate the ants. Consider setting this bait at night, because ants tend to hunt for food during the night hours. You could also make a poison mixture with Borax and powdered sugar. Mix together 1 part Borax with 3 parts of powdered sugar. Fill small containers with this mixture (bottle caps, spoons, etc. ), and place these containers around areas where ants may be entering your house. If you have pets or children who could get into this powdered Borax mix, consider mixing 1 cup of warm with \u00bd cup of sugar, and 3 tablespoons of Borax. Soak cotton balls in this mixture, and set the cotton balls out in shallow dishes near known ant entry points."

          "description":"Commercial bait traps eliminate ants much the same way as Borax traps, but they tend to work a bit faster (although they are still slow-acting), and can be more targeted to specific food preferences of your invading ant. For example, there are ant baits that are sugar based, grease based, and protein based depending on what kind of ant you are dealing with. When in doubt for what kind of ant bait to use, consider getting one of each. If you find that the ants are not taking the bait, you may have to change the type of bait you are using, or relocate the bait to a more active area. When using bait, all other food competition must be removed from the area. This food competition could inhibit the effectiveness of the bait. When the ants start feeding on the bait, leave them alone to feast and bring it back to their colony. After some time, you should see a reduced number of ants."
