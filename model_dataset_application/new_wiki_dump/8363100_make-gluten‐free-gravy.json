For this purpose, any alternative to wheat-based starch will work just as well. Sweet rice flour, King Arthur gluten-free multi-purpose flour, or simple cornstarch are all good choices, and will result in a rich, smooth gravy with no noticeable differences in taste. Many gluten-free chefs praise the smooth texture of sweet rice flour for making gravies, soups and sauces. You can also use white rice flour if it\u2019s what you have on hand. If you decide to use cornstarch, you can skip the roux-making phase altogether, as it will thicken the stock on its own."

          "description":"Place about 2.5 tablespoons of unsalted butter in a small saucepan and begin heating it at a medium-high temperature. Coat the entire bottom of the saucepan to keep the flour from sticking later on. The butter will serve as one half of the base of the roux, which should be equal parts fat and starch in order to set up and flavor properly. Unsalted butter will have less of an influence on the saltiness of the gravy, giving you more control over how it\u2019s seasoned. Substitute olive oil if you have eaters that are dairy-free."

          "description":"Use a measuring cup to portion out roughly 2.5 tablespoons of sweet rice flour, gluten-free multi-purpose flour or cornstarch. Sprinkle the gluten-free flour into the melted butter, stirring as you go. When combined, the two ingredients will begin to form a thick paste. Stir in the flour as you pour, rather than dumping it all in at once. Remember to keep the ratio of flour to butter equal."

          "headline":"Whisk the roux to smooth it out.",
          "description":"Stir the mixture constantly at a gentle speed to break up clumps and make sure the flour and butter are distributed evenly. Due to the characteristics of their grains, certain gluten-free flours will thicken differently, so don\u2019t worry if your roux seems a little gummier than it should be. You\u2019ll be able to thin the gravy out when it comes time to incorporate the stock. A perfect roux is smooth, creamy and all one color and consistency. Whisking the roux also helps expose it to air, which will prevent it from burning or becoming dense and gelatinous."

          "headline":"Cook the roux until it begins to brown.",
          "description":"Undercooked gluten-free flour can have a somewhat raw, starchy taste, interfering with the flavor of the gravy. To counteract this, heat the roux until it becomes a deep tan color. This will break down the starch a bit so that it\u2019s not as noticeable in the finished gravy. Your roux doesn\u2019t need to get too dark. You should end up with something resembling a blonde gravy that\u2019s slightly lighter in color than the regular variety. Be careful not to overcook the roux. If it gets too brown, the gravy may have a burnt, unpleasant taste."

The stock will even out the consistency of the gravy and give it its salty, savory base flavor. Look for low- or no-sodium varieties so that you can season the gravy yourself to the desired saltiness once it\u2019s ready. Check to make sure the store-bought stock you\u2019re buying doesn\u2019t contain traces of gluten.

Scoop up about a 1 \u00bd cups of dripping in a measuring cup, making sure you get some of the tasty fat that\u2019s floating on top. With real turkey drippings, the gravy will have a more authentic, homespun flavor. Reusing the turkey drippings may make for deeper, more complex gravy, since you\u2019ll also be able to taste hints of the herbs and spices used to season the turkey. Be sure to taste the drippings to see how much salt you\u2019ll need to add later. Discard your drippings altogether if they\u2019re burnt."

It\u2019s better to add the stock in increments so that you don\u2019t accidentally make the gravy watery.

The stock, drippings and butter all contain a little bit of salt, so you may not need to add much extra to get the gravy adequately seasoned.
