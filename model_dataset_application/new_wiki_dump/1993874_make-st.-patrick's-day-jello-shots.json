Place the saucepan over medium heat until the gelatin is dissolved, stirring constantly. Once the gelatin has dissolved in a few minutes, remove the pan from the heat. It\u2019s best to use clear and unflavored gelatin for these shots. The quantity required for this recipe is about two envelops of gelatin."

          "headline":"Add the vodka and milk.",
          "description":"Pour the alcohol and sweetened condensed milk into the warm lemonade and gelatin mixture. Stir the mixture to completely incorporate all the ingredients. To make these shots non-alcoholic, use water instead of vodka. In place of the sweetened condensed milk, you can also use a combination of regular milk and ice cream."

        {
          "headline":"Divide the mixture.",
          "description":"Pour the gelatin mixture into three separate bowls. Each bowl should contain the same amount of the mixture. By dividing the mixture, you can color each one a different shade of green to make the tri-colored jello shots."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add food coloring to the three bowls.",
          "description":"For the best results, use green and neon green food coloring. You can experiment with different quantities of the food coloring to create different shades if you like. For a basic tri-colored shot with light, medium, and dark green layers:\nIn the first bowl, stir in two drops each of green and neon green to create a light green. In the second bowl, stir in four drops each of green and neon green to create a medium green. In the third bowl, stir in six drops each of green and neon green to create a dark green. To make Irish flag jello shots, leave one bowl the whitish color it is, color one bowl green, and color the last bowl orange."

        {
          "headline":"Pour the light layer of jello.",
          "description":"Arrange your 10 shot glasses on a tray or baking sheet. Fill each shot glass one-quarter of the way full with the light green jello. This will be the bottom layer. Transfer the tray with the filled shot glasses to the refrigerator and let them set for 20 minutes. Cover the other two bowls of jello with sheets of plastic wrap to keep them from setting. You can use any type of shot glass you like, including straight or tapered ones, but make sure they're clear so people can see the multiple layers. To make Irish flag jello shots, put the green layer on the bottom."

Remove the plastic wrap from the medium green jello, and fill each shot glass with equal amounts of medium green jello as light green. The shot glasses should be halfway full at this point. Once they\u2019ve been filled with the second layer, return the shot glasses to the refrigerator to set for another 20 minutes. For the Irish flag jello shots, the whitish layer should be the second layer."

Make sure you have equal layers of light, medium, and dark green jello. The glasses should be three-quarters full. To finish Irish flag jello shots, pour the orange layer on last."

          "headline":"Give the jello time to set.",
          "description":"When all three layers have been poured, transfer the shots to the refrigerator one last time. Let the jello set overnight if possible, or for at least four hours. The jello is ready when it\u2019s completely firm. To prevent a hard film from developing on top of the jello, cover the shots with a large sheet of plastic wrap."

          "description":"Right before it\u2019s time to serve the jello shots, remove them from the refrigerator. Top each one with a small dollop of whipped cream to fill the remaining quarter of the shot glasses. You can also garnish them with green or gold sugar if you like. Serve the shots with small spoons so people can dig out the jello."

This will be warm enough to dissolve the gelatin, but not so hot that the alcohol burns off the beer. You can also microwave the Guinness for 80 seconds to heat it.
