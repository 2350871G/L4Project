          "description":"Depending on the extent of the damage, you may just need to cut out a bit of drywall or you may need to remove entire portions. If you only need to remove a small portion of the ceiling, use a keyhole saw or similar tool to remove the affected area. If the damage is extensive, you may need to use the claw end of a hammer or a crowbar to remove all of the damaged material. Ensure all stained drywall is removed and that any material remaining is dry and not sagging. Clean the area with household cleaner to ensure mildew and mold does not develop."

          "description":"Now that all of the damaged material is removed, it\u2019s time to replace it with new drywall. Cut a portion of drywall that is the same approximate size as the area you cut out of the ceiling. If the hole you are patching is small, simply place the newly cut drywall into the hole, then use drywall joint compound to fill the gap and serve as glue to keep it in place. Use a putty knife to ensure it is flat and even. If the hole is larger, you may need help holding the replacement drywall in place while you use the joint compound to fill the gap and set. Allow the drywall joint compound to dry thoroughly, then use fine sand paper to ensure it is flat and even."

Many hardware stores can match the color for you if you provide them with a sample. Repainting the entire ceiling will ensure the color matches throughout. Adding a layer of shellac before you primer can help seal the repair."
