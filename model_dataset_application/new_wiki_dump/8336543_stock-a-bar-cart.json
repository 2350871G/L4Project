One bottle of each should be the foundation of any well-stocked bar cart. It's not uncommon to include more than one bottle of each, especially if you already know which liquors you use the most frequently. You could expand the basics by including two bottles of each liquor \u2013 an average brand and a top-shelf brand. Differences between average and top shelf liquors include how thoroughly they may be distilled and the quality of ingredients. Top shelf liquors are more expensive than other brands. Flavored liquors are popular, but they aren't essential for a basic set up since their uses can be fairly limited."

          "headline":"Add cocktail mixers and liqueurs.",
          "description":"You can make most cocktails with one of the following base mixers: dry vermouth, sweet vermouth or Lillet, Cointreau or triple sec and bitters (Angostura, orange, etc.). One bottle of each mixer is fine. If you have favorites or anticipate using one of them frequently, go ahead and get a second bottle. The most common liqueurs and cordials to have on hand are limoncellos, Bailey's Irish Cr\u00e8me and triple sec. One of each is plenty. Keep basic grocery store mixers on hand. Coke, orange juice, ginger ale, and tonic are all very popular in cocktails. To avoid wasting mixers, buy the tiny bottles and cans. You can use these individually as needed."

Cocktail cherries, olives and/or onions and simple syrup should be in any well-stocked bar cart. Keep a small, preferably covered bin or section in your cart set aside for these items. Don't forget about cocktail sticks, which are essential for holding garnishes. Some people like to have them just for decoration. Straws and swivel sticks are also good to have in your bar cart. Keep extra limes and lemons to use for juicing."

Short glasses include shot glasses and lowballs. The essential taller glasses are pint glasses, highballs and martini glasses. Six to eight of each is ideal for a basic set up. If you're serving wine, you'll need to have wine glasses on hand. At a minimum, you should have one type that will hold any wine you plan to serve. However, most bartenders believe reds and whites should have different glasses. That choice is up to you. If you're only serving beer, only having pint glasses and highballs is fine."

          "description":"Jiggers are small glasses used to measure different amounts of liquor. Some people like to mix drinks by eyeballing the liquor as they pour, but this isn't recommended. Jiggers allow you to measure exactly. Bar spoons have thin handles that are long enough to reach the bottom of a shaker. You will use these constantly to stir, mix and layer cocktails. If you are a bartender for someone else, or if you're setting up someone else's bar cart, you definitely need to include several jiggers. Jiggers and bar spoons take up relatively little space, so try to keep at least 6 to 8 of each stocked in the cart."

If you're serving wine, at least one quality corkscrew is absolutely necessary. The paring knife and cutting board are mostly for keeping up with garnishes, so at minimum have one of each. If you serve a lot of wine, spend a little extra money and invest in a good corkscrew that can pull corks quickly without breaking them."

One favorite is a vintage-themed bar cart. You could stock it with vintage glassware and vintage-style tools. You could even go all out and invest in a bar cart that is vintage. Sports-themed bar carts are also popular. You could deck yours out with team-themed drinks, napkins in team colors and a decal of your favorite team's logo right on the cart. You could also base your theme around a particular type of drink and stock the bar with only the items needed for that. For example, you could set up a martini-themed bar cart for a party."
