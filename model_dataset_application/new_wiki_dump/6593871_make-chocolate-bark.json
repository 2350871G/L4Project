          "description":"Measure \u00be cup (170 grams) of raw nuts and place them on a rimmed baking sheet covered in aluminum foil. Toast the nuts for about 8 minutes, or until their edges turn golden. Sometimes the nuts will turn golden in as little as 6 minutes. Other times, they\u2019ll take closer to 10 minutes. Check on the nuts after 5 minutes to monitor their progress. You can choose from almonds, hazelnuts, pecans, or pistachios. If you want to use more than 1 kind of nut, go right ahead!Tip: Certain nuts work best with certain kinds of chocolate. If you\u2019re using dark chocolate, use pecans, peanuts, hazelnuts, or almonds. If you\u2019re melting milk chocolate, go with walnuts because they\u2019re milder than other nuts. Finally, if you\u2019re making white chocolate bark, use macadamia nuts."

          "description":"Transfer the nuts from the oven to a cutting board once they've cooled. Scoop the nuts into a pile and roughly chop them with a large knife. If you can't or don't want to use nuts, substitute a hard candy like Jolly Ranchers, peppermints, or M&Ms for your crunchy ingredient. Put these candies on a plate and stick them in the microwave for 10 seconds to soften them up. Then, transfer the candies to your cutting board and chop them up into tiny pieces."

          "description":"Take the chocolate chips and place them in a microwave-safe bowl. Then, put the bowl in the microwave and melt the chocolate in 30-second increments. Take the bowl out after each 30-second increment and stir the chocolate with a spatula. When the chocolate is about 90% melted, it\u2019s done. Keep stirring at that point to completely dissolve the remaining pieces. You can use chocolate bars instead of chocolate chips if desired. Additionally, choose your favorite kind of chocolate, whether that's white, milk, dark, or a combination.Tip: You can melt chocolate on your stove or in a double boiler if you don\u2019t want to use the microwave for this step."

Make the layer of chocolate about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) thick. If you make the thickness about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm), the chocolate won\u2019t reach the edges of the baking sheet and will be easier to remove from the sheet when it\u2019s hardened."

Use your palms to lightly press the nuts and fruit into the chocolate. As an alternative, you can combine the nuts and chocolate before placing the 2 ingredients on the baking sheet. This way, the chocolate will harden around the nuts as opposed to below them. Best Chocolate and Fruit Pairings:\nMilk Chocolate: Apricots, cherries, coconuts\nDark Chocolate: Cherries, coconut, pears, raspberries\nWhite Chocolate: Blackberries, blueberries, oranges"

Lightly poke at it with a spatula to feel if it has hardened. If you feel the nuts and fruit move within the chocolate, it hasn\u2019t completely hardened yet.Tip: If you\u2019re in a hurry and need the bark to harden quickly, place the baking pan in your fridge for about 15 minutes."

Instead, break the bark into triangles and squares that are about 4 inches (10 cm) long. Serve the bark immediately so everyone can eat it when it\u2019s fresh and ready."

Chocolate bark will stay fresh for up to 1 week. You can also keep the chocolate bark in the fridge, but only store it in the fridge for 3-4 days at most."
