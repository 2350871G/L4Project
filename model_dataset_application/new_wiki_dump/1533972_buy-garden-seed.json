Research seed farmers and seed companies in your area to get a feel for what's available. Browse online seed stores to compare stock, prices, and customer reviews. To narrow down your search, start by searching for vendors offering the particular seeds you are looking for and expand your scope as needed."

          "description":"To get high-quality seeds, avoid buying from large corporations that mass-market their products. Buy from smaller companies that show a commitment to sustaining the environment and producing healthy, organic seeds. Shop at local seed businesses, or look online to expand your search. Quality seeds will likely produce higher yields and healthier plants. Look into how long a seed company has been in business and if there are any consumer complaints against them."

          "headline":"Look for organic seeds to ensure that you have a chemical-free garden.",
          "description":"Organic seeds come from parent plants that are pesticide-free and organically grown. These seeds may be heirloom or hybrid. Buy organic seeds to ensure that your own garden has no traces of synthetic pesticides, and to contribute to the harvesting and distribution of chemical-free seeds. Make sure the seeds you buy are labelled \"certified organic.\" If seeds are not specifically labelled organic, they are probably not. Purchase organic seeds to grow non-edible plants as well as fruits and vegetables to ensure a chemical-free garden."

        {
          "headline":"Buy heirloom seeds for plants that are not genetically modified or artificially selected.",
          "description":"Heirloom seeds come from plants that have been grown naturally without any artificial adjustments to their genetic makeup or selective breeding. The seeds from these plants will produce the same type of plant they were harvested from. Look for heirloom seeds if you do not wish to grow any genetically modified or artificially bred plants in your garden. \"Heirloom\" generally signifies that seeds have been harvested and passed down within 1 family or community for at least 50 years. With a few exceptions, GMO seeds are not widely available to members of the general public. However, many plants are bred under controlled conditions to select for specific characteristics (such as size, color, or shape). Heirloom seeds are open-pollinated, allowing them to retain their unique characteristics."

          "headline":"Purchase hybrid seeds if you are interested in \"enhanced\" plants.",
          "description":"Hybrid seeds are crossbred from 2 different parent plants to promote certain desirable traits. These \"enhanced\" seeds may produce plants that are more disease-resistant or produce larger fruit. Look for hybrid plant seeds if you are interested in plants that may produce unique and \"enhanced\" crops. Broccolini, a hybrid of broccoli and gai lan, is an example of a hybrid plant. The disadvantage of this type of garden seed is that unique plant genes, affecting things like flavor and texture, may be lost in crossbreeding."

Choose warm weather seeds if you want to grow things during the late spring, summer, or early fall, when the soil is still relatively warm. Seeds that grow best in a warm environment include cucumbers, tomatoes, eggplants, basil, squash, zinnias, and nasturtiums."

Buy seed trays from a garden store or online to germinate your seeds indoors. The length and width of your seed tray should depend on how many seeds you're planting. As a general rule, your tray should be 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) deep. The time that your seeds will need to germinate will depend on the type of plants you are growing. For instance, marigold seeds will sprout in 5-7 days, while zinnia seeds will sprout in 7-10 days."

Make sure that your soil is garden-ready before planting. Choose these seeds if you want an easy planting experience that will not require the transferring of any sprouts to your garden. Notable cold-resistant seeds include kale, lettuce, broccoli, peas, carrots, cilantro, parsley, and cabbage. Root vegetables are well-suited for the direct sowing method of planting because they are difficult to transfer after germination. For instance, buy carrot, beet, or radish seeds."
