Keep in mind that during an earthquake you'll have only seconds to get into a safe place, such as underneath sturdy furniture or against an interior wall, away from windows and unsecured furniture that could fall on you. Knowing what to do if you're not all together, including having communication methods and central meeting points. Identify a single meeting place for all family members to reunite, when possible, after an earthquake. Mapping escape routes to and from your home. This means making escape route plans for leaving work/school/other regularly visited places to your home and plans for leaving your home. Be aware of alternative routes and be aware that if the electricity and internet connections are down, you need paper maps and road guides. Keep the escape plans in your \"go bag\" or in a safe place at work/school, etc. Deciding who can help you if you need to leave the city or town for a while. Which family members or friends interstate or across the region might put you and your family up for a while if things are bad enough that you have to leave? Ask them in advance if they are prepared to be your refuge in such a situation and reassure them that you will cover costs, etc."
