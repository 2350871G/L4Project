A piece of furniture that has many scratches and dents may be made out of softwood. Try scratching an inconspicuous area of the furniture with your fingernail if you don\u2019t notice any marks to see if it is easy to put a mark into, which can indicate that it is made out of softwood. Softwoods come from conifers like pine, redwood, and cedar."

Remember that if your furniture is stained or weathered, it will be harder to tell what kind of wood it is based on the color.
