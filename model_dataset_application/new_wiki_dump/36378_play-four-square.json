If they don\u2019t hit the ball correctly or it goes out of bounds, that is a \u201cfault,\u201d and one fault is allowed per round.

The goal of the game is to move up to the servers\u2019 square. If you have more than 4 players, a new player will move into the lowest-numbered square when a player is eliminated. If you only have 4 players, the person who is out moves to the lowest-numbered square and the other players move up, if applicable. Playing Variations on the Game Allow young players to catch the ball for an easier version of Four Square. Younger or less-skilled players might have more fun if they can catch the ball before throwing it again. Assign 2 players per square if you have 8 or more players. Play a relay-style variation of Four Square by having 2 players for each square. Whenever one player hits the ball to another square, they\u2019ll jump out of their court and their partner will jump in. When playing with 2 players per square, if one player is out then the team is out. If everyone agrees, however, you can adjust the rules to allow the other team member to continue playing until they are out. Hit the ball into your own square first for an Australian variation. Australian players must bounce the ball in their own square, regardless of whether the ball has already bounced in their own square. Also, in Australian Four Square the ball is allowed to touch the line. Play Black Jack to get players out faster. In Black Jack, if a player can catch the ball before it lands in their square, then the person who hit the ball is out. This usually makes the game move faster. Allow the server to make up special rules to keep the game changing. The server can call a rule that all of the players must follow, but it only lasts for that round.
