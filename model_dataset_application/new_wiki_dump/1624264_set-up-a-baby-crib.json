If you are buying a used crib or receive a used crib, check on the official website to make sure that the model was not recalled.

Common crib parts include screws, bolts, headboard, footboard, support spring, and side panels. If you are missing pieces or find defective pieces, contact the crib manufacturer and request that they send you new ones. Ensure that all pre-assembled parts are properly constructed and screwed together. Loose pieces could create a hazard for your child."
