The paperclips, one to act as lock pick, one to act as tension wrench, and a pair of pliers to shape the paperclips. Two big paperclips, one to act as tension wrench, one to act as the pick. There is no upper size limit, but you want to make sure that the width is not slim enough that it will fit into the lock and that the height is tall enough so that you can insert it into the lock while still holding onto enough length to turn them. Grab a pair of pliers to shape the two paperclips. It's easier to use pliers than your hands."

Some locksmiths also put a tiny upward bend into the tip of the pick. This is to depress the pins inside the lock, but is not strictly necessary."

Make a 90\u00b0 bend in the curved end that's about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) long. Alternately, you could unfold an edge of your paperclip until a straight portion sticks out at a 90\u00b0 angle. This is a basic tension wrench that is workable but not ideal."

There are a couple ways to test the lock and see which way the key would turn. If you know which way the lock turns in order to open, turn the tension wrench in that direction. If you don't know what direction the lock opens, guess to one side; on the first shot, you'll have a 50/50 chance of opening the lock. If you have a sensitive touch, you can also feel which way the lock opens by turning with the tension wrench. Turn clockwise first, then counter-clockwise. You'll feel slightly less pressure when the wrench turns the right direction."

Quickly doesn't mean yanking it out, but you want to move quickly enough that the motion is smooth.

This will tell you where you need to depress them."
