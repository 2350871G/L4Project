Your fern can still be a young plant when you buy it. Rabbit foot ferns are available at garden centers and through online distributors. Choose a plant that looks vibrant, green, and healthy.

The container should be either plastic or clay, and 6\u201310 inches (15\u201325 cm) in diameter. Plastic containers tend to allow for a more even distribution of water than clay pots, but clay pots are sturdier and may last longer."
