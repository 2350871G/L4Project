Changing Reusable Bags Open the vacuum body. Reusable bags are usually stored in the same manner and place as disposable bags. Open the body of your vacuum, whether it is a zip closure or plastic lid to find your reusable bag. Remove the cloth bag or plastic chamber carefully. Remove the bag from the vacuum chamber, keeping your hand over the hole that attaches to the vacuum itself.

Once you\u2019ve finished replacing the bag or plastic bin, close your vacuum and check to make sure it is functioning properly with the clean bag. If not, check to make sure the bag or bin is dry and clean. Changing Handheld Vacuum Bags Dismantle your handheld vacuum. Most handheld vacuums have a small, reusable bag or plastic chamber used to store any dirt and debris that has collected. Remove the plastic surrounding the chamber or bag to access the collected dirt and miscellaneous items. Because handheld vacuums are small, removing the tray or bag is usually a small enough task that it can be done over a kitchen trash. Place the bag\u2019s contents into the trash.
