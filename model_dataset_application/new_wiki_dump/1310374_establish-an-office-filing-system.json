          "description":"When establishing an office filing system, it can be helpful to first ask your coworkers if they plan to use the filing system. This will help you assess where to locate the files so that they will be easily accessible, and determine who may have files that need to be incorporated into your system. As you determine who will be using your system, you can also take some time to ask for input about what other users think will collectively work best for your office."

          "headline":"Review your office\u2019s materials to assess what needs to be filed.",
          "description":"First, gather together all the office materials that need to be filed. Then, look through all the materials to assess what and how much needs to be filed away and what can be discarded. This will help you calculate your storage needs and determine how many files and filing cabinets or shelves you\u2019ll need."

        {
          "headline":"Decide on the location for your filing system.",
          "description":"First, look around your office and talk to your office manager to find out what spaces are available for your filing system. Once you know what your options are, it can be helpful to take into consideration who will be using the filing system, as well as how often you and your office mates typically need to access files. You can then determine which available location works best for your office\u2019s needs. For example, if you don\u2019t usually need these materials once they\u2019re filed away, you might not need to store them in your immediate workspace. Instead, you could choose to keep your filing system in a closet or storage space nearby. If you\u2019ve determined that the accountants in your office will be using the filing system but the graphic designers won\u2019t, for example, it would then make sense for you to use any available space closer to the accounting department to make it easier for the users to access."

          "description":"Suspension files are organized in a filing cabinet and generally have a clearly visible label tab, making them easy to search and access. The materials in each suspension file can be further subdivided with labeled manila folders. Therefore, if you have several subcategories of materials, this type of filing may work best. Suspension files work particularly well with files that are arranged alphabetically or numerically. Each filing cabinet drawer can be labeled with the range of letters or numbers held in that drawer."

          "description":"If you have documents, notes, and other materials that you and your office mates need to access frequently, a binder filing system may work best for you. With binders, you can organize your files into smaller, more specific categories and easily flip through and find the materials you use on a daily or weekly basis. Binders also make it easy for you to grab a whole category of files and take them with you to meetings or to work from home. Binders are generally stored on open shelving units, making them easy to locate and grab as needed during your work day. Binders can also be stored in filing cabinets like suspension files, or in storage boxes."

To help you decide, consider what traits some materials have in common, as well as how you and your office mates tend to search for things. Then, separate all the files into piles based on these categories. Files can be categorized alphabetically, numerically, chronologically, geographically, or by subject matter, to name a few. If you work in a real estate office, for example, you might choose to separate the materials into piles based on neighborhood. If your office sells homes on the north side of Chicago, for example, you might have 1 pile for Roscoe Village, 1 pile for Lincoln Park, and 1 pile for Andersonville. As you separate the materials into piles, it can be helpful to also create a pile for materials that you and your office mates won\u2019t need anymore."

How you choose to do this will depend on the types of files you have, as well as what organizational structure works best for your office. For example, if you work in a real estate office in Chicago and have separated the files by neighborhood, you may then want to organize the files within each neighborhood alphabetically by your client\u2019s last name. Within the pile of materials relating to homes sold in the Roscoe Village neighborhood, then, start with the \u201cA\u201d last names on top, then the \u201cB\u201ds, and so on."

Label makers costs anywhere from $25 to $200 USD. It could be worth the investment to be able to easily create readable, uniform labels. Keep in mind that while your handwriting might be readable to you, it could be difficult for someone else to decipher.
