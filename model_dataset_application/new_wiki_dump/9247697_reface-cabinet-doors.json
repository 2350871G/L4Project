This way, you\u2019ll know exactly where to put them when you go to reattach your doors after you\u2019re done with your refacing project.

This way, you'll be able to paint your doors without them falling down and with minimal dripping or running. If you choose to lay your doors on the ground, place plastic or a cloth sheet down first."

Next, slightly dampen a clean rag in deglosser and wipe the door down again. This will ensure you\u2019ve deglossed the entire surface of the door.

Then, move on to 180-grit sandpaper. Finally, finish up with 220-grit sandpaper. Sand until the entire surface is smooth and all paint or stain has been removed.

Overfill the holes just slightly, as the filler may shrink. When the filler dries, sand it with 100-grit sandpaper.
