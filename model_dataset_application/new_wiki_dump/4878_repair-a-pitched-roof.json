Use a shingle ripper (a long bar with a hook on one end) to reach *under* the damaged shingle, and grab on to one nail that holds the shingle down. Use the shingle ripper to rip the shingle free of the nail / shear off the nail. There will be four or more nails per shingle. Normal asphalt shingles are \"three tab\" type, or built up \"Heritage\" type, or \"T-Locks\": there will be one nail above each tab-division slit, and one at each end of the shingle on the three tab type, one at each end and two nails equally spaced in the field on the \"Heritage\" type (Note:  This type of shingle is becoming ever more popular. It is a built up type of shingle without any slits or cutouts or tabs. Because it has no tabs if an odd length is required to fill a space it can be cut to fit without affecting the roofing pattern), and one nail above the slit on the \"T-locks\" type. All nails will be in a row, about one inch further up the shingle from the \"weather\" portion. That is the nails on a shingle are always covered by the shingle in the next higher row. As each shingle is nailed down the nail not only penetrates that shingle, it also penetrates the shingle underneath-the shingle from the previous row.
