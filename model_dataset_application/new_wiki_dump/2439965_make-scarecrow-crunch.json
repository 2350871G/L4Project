You will need to microwave the ingredients and butter together so find a bowl that will hold all your ingredients. Combine cereal, pretzels and cookies in the large bowl. You will still need to add the other ingredients later so make sure the bowl does not run over. Set bowl aside. Melt butter in a small bowl or microwaveable mug. Be sure you watch the butter carefully as it may splatter or even scorch. Microwave butter for approximately 30 seconds, check the butter and stir. The butter may not be completely melted, but stirring it may break it down. Place butter back in the microwave if the butter is still lumpy after the first 30 seconds in the microwave. Pour melted butter over the cereal, pretzels and cookies. Stir using a rubber spatula. Be careful not to crush cereal or allow the mixture to become too mushy. Microwave the bowl of mixed cereal, pretzels and cookies for up to six minutes. Check and mix cereal every two minutes. Add Remaining Ingredients Line countertop with parchment paper. You will be placing warm mixture on the parchment paper and allow it to cool so be sure you have enough counter space to evenly spread mixture out. Toss remaining ingredients to warm mixture.
