          "description":"The type of rope you purchase will depend on your experience/fitness level and how you plan to use your jump rope. If you are a beginner jumper, then you may want to choose a cloth or beaded jump rope. These types of jump ropes turn more slowly and offer more control than PVC ropes, so they are a good choice for mastering form when you are just starting out. If you are an intermediate/fitness jumper, then you may want to choose a leather or PVC jump rope. These types of jump ropes are lightweight and they can move quickly for speed training. If you are an experienced/speed jumper, then you may want to choose a speed rope. Speed ropes are made of lightweight PVC and some speed ropes have ball bearings attached to the rope ends that help your rope turn even more quickly.

Halle Payne, former member of Stanford Jump Rope, tells us: \"As a team, we used beaded ropes for most of our jumping, because they give you the most control when it comes to tricks. They also make a really satisfying sound when the team is jumping in unison. However, if you're going to be jumping for speed and fitness (without any tricks), I would recommend a light speed rope that you can find on Amazon. It will completely change how fast you are able to go.\""
