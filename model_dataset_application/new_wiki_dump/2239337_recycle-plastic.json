Rinse out the insides of old food containers and get rid of all the food waste to make it easier for the center to actually recycle your plastic.Use hot water and a scrubber to get as much of the food waste off of your plastic as you can. For plastic bottles, fill them with slightly soap water, then swish the water around to clean out the interior. Do be mindful of water usage and energy use associated with heating the water. For recyclable materials that can\u2019t be easily rinsed, such as takeout containers, your best bet is to separate the dirty parts from the clean ones and throw the dirty parts in the trash."
