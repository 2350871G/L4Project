  "text":" Get your two straws and cut or bite the bendy part off one of them.  Insert the cut straw into the non-bendy end of the other straw.  Push it in until the main body of the straw (not including the bendy part) is the same height as your bottle of cider.  Open the cider and put your home-made long straw into the bottle with the bendy part hanging out over the top of the bottle.  Bend the part outside the bottle down, so that the opening of the straw is pointing down along the neck of the bottle. The end of the straw inside the bottle should be as close to the bottom as possible; adjust the length of the straw if necessary. Put the neck of the bottle into your mouth, but make sure the end of the straw isn't in your mouth. The straw will relieve the air pressure inside the bottle that normally stops you chugging a whole bottle. Put your head back and swallow, and keep swallowing until the cider is gone. If you must breathe, use your nose. Whatever you do, don't put the bottle down.",
