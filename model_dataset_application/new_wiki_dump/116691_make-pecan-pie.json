  "text":" Making the Crust Sift the dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, sift the flour, sugar, and salt until the ingredients are completely incorporated. Cut in the butter. Place the cubes of butter in the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter to work the butter into the dough until it resembles cornmeal, with a few pea-sized pieces of butter mixed in. Mix in the egg. Lightly beat the egg in a separate bowl. Pour it into the crust mixture and use a spoon to fold it in until it is just incorporated. Don't overmix, or the dough will turn out too dense. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Use your hands to shape it into a ball. Place the ball on a sheet of plastic wrap, and fold the edges over it. Form a disc. Press down on the ball with the heels of your hands to flatten the dough into a disc. Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour.  Roll out the crust. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, take it out of the plastic wrap, and place it on a floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a large circular shape that will fit over a 9-inch pie dish. Drape the crust over the dish and trim the edges. Use your fingers to crimp the dough over the edges of the dish to hold it in place. If you'd like, use a fork to make decorative notches around the rim of the pie crust. Take care not to tear a hole in the pie crust. If you accidentally tear one, use a little extra dough to patch it up. Freeze the crust. Cover the crust with plastic wrap and place the pie plate in the freezer to firm up for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cover the pie crust with aluminum foil. Use pie weights or dried beans to fill the crust - this prevents it from bubbling up when it bakes. Bake the crust in two steps, the first for 20 minutes by placing the pie plate in the oven and beginning to bake the crust.  Remove the crust from the oven and take off the weights and aluminum foil; place it back in the oven to bake for another 10 minutes, until the crust is golden. Remove it from the oven while you make the filling. Making the Filling Heat the ingredients. Place the butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt in a saucepan. Place the saucepan over medium high heat and bring the ingredients to a boil, stirring constantly. Let them boil for one minute so that the mixture begins to thicken. Remove the filling from heat and stir in the nuts. Incorporate the pecans fully, then add  the bourbon and vanilla and stir again. Let the mixture cool for about 5 minutes. Add the eggs. Beat the eggs lightly in a separate bowl, then add them to the filling mixture. Whisk until the eggs are fully blended with the rest of the filling (if you tried leaving the eggs out, the filling would not firm up when cooled). Finishing the Pie Fill the pie. Place the pie crust on a baking sheet. Pour the filling into the crust. Use a spatula to spread it evenly. Bake the pie. Place the pie in the oven (still heated to 350 degrees) and bake it until the filling edges are set, about 50 to 60 minutes (if you had not precooked the pecans, crust and filling then it could take longer). Check it frequently to make sure the crust doesn't burn.
