      "description":"Place the frying pan on the heat, add the oil, onion, rice and stir well. Pour in the white wine and continue stirring. When the wine evaporates start adding the stock. First put in 3 ladles and cook while stirring almost continually. When the rice has absorbed most of the stock, add another couple of ladles and stir again. Season with salt and pepper. Keep on adding the stock until the rice is completely cooked. You will need to stir most of the time to stop the rice from sticking to the pan. When the rice is cooked and of a creamy consistency, stir in the parmesan and thyme and remove from the heat."

It's important that the oil you use isn't too hot as this would only brown the outside. Fry for just a minute and remove them from the heat. Place them onto a tray covered in kitchen paper to drain any excess oil. Repeat the same process until you have fried them all."
