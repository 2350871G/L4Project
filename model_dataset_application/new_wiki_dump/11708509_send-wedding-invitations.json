This also applies to guests who need to travel across country or overseas to attend your wedding. Make sure your guests have access to information about transportation and hotel accommodations for their stay as soon as possible.

Include titles as well, such as Mr., Mrs., Ms./Miss, or Dr. If you\u2019re addressing a married couple that shares a surname, you can just use the full name of whichever member of the couple you know best. For example, \u201cMrs. and Mrs. Jane Reynolds Thomson.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re addressing a single person and want to invite them to bring a plus one, write \u201cand guest\u201d after their name on the inner envelope.

Politely but firmly remind them that you are not inviting any kids to the wedding and that you\u2019re not able to make exceptions. If they\u2019re really upset or it means a lot to you for them to be there, consider offering to hire a babysitter to watch their kids during the wedding.

Once you\u2019ve sent the invitations out, call up any guests with children and explain to them that you\u2019re not able to accommodate kids at your wedding.
