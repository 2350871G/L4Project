Add a serving of protein and a serving of whole grains to a fruit-and-veggie-based lunch, and you\u2019ve got yourself a healthy lunch that will keep you full for hours.

For instance, if you made burritos for dinner you can put some burrito filling into a container of lettuce and chopped tomatoes, toss some shredded cheddar and sliced avocado on top, and you have yourself a taco salad for lunch."
