You can do this by placing the cups in a large Ziploc bag and shaking thoroughly, although stirring in a bowl will yield the most control."

Continue adding food colouring and mixing it in until the paste is as colourful as you want the paint to be. Alternatively, you can do this by pouring the mixture into different bags filled with food colouring. This way, you can make your essential mixture in one go, and create several different types of paint in the process."

          "description":"Pastel chalk is another cheap way of making paint at home. Although you'll need to add egg yolks to get the paint-like texture, the chalk sticks you choose will determine the paint's colour. Because you'll be grinding them up, aim to use older and broken pieces of chalk. Getting multiple colours in your collection will give you a variety of colour to paint with. Cheaper chalk will result in a smoother texture, but you won't get the same vibrant colours as you would with higher-end chalk material."

Place a stick of chalk in each of these slots and let them sit for 15 minutes. You can add extra sticks of chalk into the same tray slots if you want a richer colour, just so long as they're of the same colour."

Stir the mix when you're done to disperse the colour throughout each tray slot. You can also mush the chalk together with your bare hands if the chalk sticks have grown soggy enough."

          "description":"Raw eggs will make someone sick if they're ingested. In order for the egg paint to be truly non-toxic, you'll need to pasteurize them first. Crack the eggs you're making paint with and cook on high temperature for a couple of minutes. The yolk needs to reach a temperature of 138 degrees Fahrenheit. Don't overcook them to the point of scrambling. If your eggs scramble, you won't be able to use them in your paint. You can skip out on pasteurizing the eggs, but raw eggs will make children very sick if they're ingested. You can skip this if the children are old enough to know not to eat it."

Add some glow powder to the flour paste and stir it consistently. You won't need a lot of glow paint in order to get the \"glow in the dark\" effect it's supposed to create. Keep in mind that certain types of glow powder are toxic if ingested. It may be best to avoid this if the paint is going to be used by young children."

Put the soft candies you want to melt in the microwave for a few seconds, take them out and add them to your flour paste. Keep candies categorized according to their colour, as mixing random candies together will result in a murky or unpredictable colour. By making the food colouring from actual foods, you'll get some of the original food's scent as well. This is especially true in the case of Starbursts."

          "description":"Fresh, brightly coloured flowers will colour water if they're submerged. If there's a colourful garden nearby, go out and pick some bright flowers. Place each colour of flower in a Ziploc bag, and add enough water to cover the flower. Once the flowers and water are in the bag, roll them over slowly with a rolling pin. This will squeeze the colour out of the flower and into the water. From there, you'll have a functional watercolour paint to work with. Make sure that the bags aren't too full. Half a cup of water per Ziploc bag should be enough. Having too much water will both dilute the paint and risk your bag popping when you roll it over with a pin."

This will offer the painter easy access to the paint without having to dip into the bottle each time. Alternatively, you can unscrew the cap of the ketchup bottle and dip in the paintbrush directly. You should only dip in the tip. This will offer the painter the best-possible control when using the paint."

However, for the sake of simple homemade kid's paint, fun should be emphasized over technique."
