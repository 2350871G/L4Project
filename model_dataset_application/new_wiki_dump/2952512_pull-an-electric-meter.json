      "description":"The meter is often held in position by one of several methods:\nA thin metal ring with a slot and tab. The ring has a shoulder along both sides of its length that engages the a lip on the edge of the meter and the rim of the meter socket or enclosure; and holds the meter securely into the socket. Once the ring's tab has been passed through the slot, a seal is placed on it to indicate tampering. A thick metal ring with a special locked enclosure around the retaining hardware, that prevents unauthorized persons from removing the ring and meter. The meter enclosure cover itself; which holds the lip of the meter and holds it in place in the meter enclosure. The cover will employ a simple seal or special locked enclosure over the retaining hardware that allows for the opening of the cover (and meter removal) similar to the previous two examples. Some other arrangement specific to the requirements of the local power company in your area. These types can not be covered by this wiki at this time."

Those meters secured with thick rings / special locked enclosures, etc. will not be able to be removed without causing severe damage to the meter or enclosure and significant risk of shock, burns, fire or electrocution.

You may be asked why you need to remove the meter, how long it is expected to be removed, etc. If you determine that you are unable to remove the meter, you can schedule to have an authorized employee to do this for you at this time."

Note: switching circuit breakers to off and removing of fuses from the electrical panel will not remove power from the meter or enclosure. Switch ALL branch circuit breakers (typically all single and double pole types from 15 amps ~ 60 amps) handles to OFF, then locate the Service Disconnect Switch (the largest value circuit breaker) in the electrical panel; and move the handle to OFF, too. Remove fuses. Unscrew all fuses 2-3 full turns or more. Pull cartridge type fuses out completely and note the location of each for proper re-installation later."

Check garages, out buildings, etc. and remove the load as described above. Ideally, the load should be fully disconnected before continuing. Keep in mind: Even though the meter isn't advancing because load has been shed; it does not mean the power is off!
