          "headline":"Eat less beef, cheese, and pork.",
          "description":"One of the biggest causes of the fires in the Amazon Rainforest is local farmers who are clearing land to raise cattle or pigs. Cattle especially require a large amount of land so they can graze. If people start consuming less beef and dairy on a large scale, farmers in the Amazon may begin growing more environmentally-friendly crops, like barley, sweet potatoes, and soybeans. Try incorporating more plant-based meals into your diet, including protein-rich foods like beans, soy, and nuts. If you don't want to give up beef, try to choose meat that comes from pasture-raised cows, which may have less of an environmental impact than farm-raised beef.Did You Know? Brazil is currently the world's largest exporter of beef."

          "headline":"Use fewer wood and paper products.",
          "description":"In order to access timber in the rainforest, corporations often set fires to clear out underbrush. To help prevent that, try limiting how many paper and wood products you use, buy recycled products whenever possible, and recycle your own paper and wood waste so it can be reused by someone else. Instead of buying a brand new piece of furniture, for example, you might check local consignment shops, antique stores, and online marketplaces for a secondhand piece. To reduce the amount of paper you use, make small changes like switching to online billing, using cloth towels instead of disposable paper towels, and printing on both sides of a sheet. Recycle paper products like office paper, magazines, cardboard, and phone books."

These organizations award certification to companies that focus on environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Products certified by the FSC will bear a logo that features a checkmark and a tree above the letters \"FSC\". You can also check their database by visiting https://us.fsc.org/en-us/market/find-products/fsc-certificate-database. RA-certified products have a green frog on the product label.

Become an informed consumer, and research the corporations you buy from. If a corporation supports deforestation or environmental deregulation, avoid buying the goods that they produce. Try doing research on sites that allow you to educate yourself about different products and corporations. For instance, you might visit the Ethical Consumer at https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/."
