          "headline":"Wipe down your skillet with oil to get rid of lightly stuck food.",
          "description":"If you catch your food just as it starts to burn to the cast iron, you may be able to clean it out with 1-2 tablespoons (15-30 mL) of oil. Pour the oil into the skillet while it is still warm and use a paper towel to wipe down the surface. Dispose of any bits of food that come loose and put your skillet away for storage. As you are using oil to clean your skillet, it should be ready for storage and prepared for the next time you want to cook with it. Use an oil with a high smoke point and a neutral taste for the best results. Vegetable oil, grapeseed oil or flaxseed oil will all work perfectly. This method will likely only work with food that's just recently burnt onto the skillet. For skillets which are seriously burnt, or which have been left for a long time, you might need to give them a more thorough clean."

          "headline":"Use baking soda or salt to scrub away burnt food.",
          "description":"Foods that were left to burn for a little longer will need something more abrasive than just oil. Scatter some kosher salt, coarse sea salt, or baking soda over the base of your skillet. Use a paper towel to begin scrubbing out any food stuck to the skillet. Give the cast iron a light rinse to remove any leftover salt or baking soda. You can use almost any coarse, abrasive powder to clean your skillet with this method. Cornmeal will work excellently in place of baking soda, but something like sugar may melt onto the surface of your skillet and give you something else to clean."

          "headline":"Lift away more difficult foods by boiling some water in your skillet.",
          "description":"For food that's had more time to burn onto your skillet or left to sit, you may be able to boil it away. Fill your skillet with around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water and place it over a medium heat. As the water begins to simmer and boil, use a wooden or plastic spoon or spatula to try and scrape away the burnt-on food. Make sure you pour the water out and left your skillet fully dry before storing it or using it again. You should only use plastic or wooden tools in your cast iron, rather than anything metal. Metal spatulas and spoons will scratch the surface and strip away the seasoning on the pan.

Kadi Dulude\t\t\tCleaning & Organization Expert\t\t\t\tYou can remove most burnt food by soaking the pan in water. If that doesn't work, boil water in the pan while pushing at the burnt food with a wooden spoon. If the food still isn't coming off, you can use a metal scouring pad to scrape the food. Always re-season your pan with olive oil before putting it away."

Put it in a 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) oven for 10 minutes, or over a medium-high stovetop to let it completely dry. Any water left on your skillet when you put it away may cause it to start rusting.

When the cast iron is still warm, pour 1-2 tablespoons (15-30 mL) of oil into the skillet and use a paper towel to spread it all over the surface. Store your clean skillet in a dry place until you need to use it next. The oil on the warm surface of your pan will react with the cast iron to form a polymer. This is what will keep the skillet non-stick and in a great condition for a very long time. If you have already used oil to clean your skillet, you can skip this step. Choose a neutral oil with a high smoke point when seasoning your pan. Vegetable oil, flaxseed oil, and grapeseed oil will all work excellently."
