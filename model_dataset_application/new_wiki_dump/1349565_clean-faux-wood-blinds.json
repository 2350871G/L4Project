          "description":"For routine dusting, start by closing the blinds completely. Run a feather duster or dry microfiber cloth over each slat, starting at the top corner and working your way down to the bottom slat. Open the blinds again and then close them in the opposite direction. Use the cloth to dust the slats on the other side. Run a dryer sheet over the slats every couple of days to prevent dust from sticking to them. Avoid pushing dust into the cords running through the slats."

          "description":"Attach the brush attachment to the hose of your vacuum cleaner. Close the blinds face down. Use one hand to hold the edge of the blinds steady, and use the other to vacuum. Start at the top corner and run the brush attachment from one side of the slat to the other. One pass is usually enough but, for extra dirty blinds, run the brush attachment back and forth across the slat. Move down to the next slat and repeat the same actions. Use the vacuum\u2019s lowest setting. Too much suction can twist or damage the slats."

Start at the top again with the brush attachment and work your way down to the last slat. After you\u2019ve cleaned all the slats, lift the blinds up and vacuum along the windowsill underneath them."

In these situations, mix a small amount of warm water with a mild detergent. Slightly dampen a microfiber cloth with the cleaning solution (don\u2019t soak the cloth, you only need a small amount) and run it over each slat. Close the blinds in the opposite direction and repeat the same actions. Gently blot the slats with a dry microfiber cloth."
