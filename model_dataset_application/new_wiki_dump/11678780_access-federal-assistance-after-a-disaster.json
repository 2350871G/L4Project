          "headline":"Meet a FEMA inspector at your damaged home.",
          "description":"After you've submitted your application, an inspector will contact you, typically within a couple of days, to schedule the inspection of your damaged home. You must be present when this inspection takes place. The inspector will be wearing official FEMA ID badges. They'll verify your identity and ownership or occupancy of the home, then assess the damage. When the inspector shows up, you must have a valid photo ID, lease or utility bill to prove occupancy, and deed or mortgage payment book to prove ownership."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Wait for your decision letter.",
          "description":"It typically only takes 2 or 3 days after the inspector's visit for funds to be made available to you. FEMA can direct-deposit the money into your bank account or send you a check. Within a few days after you receive your funds, you'll get a decision letter with details about the assistance you qualify for. If you receive your decision letter and you still haven't gotten any money from FEMA, call the Disaster Assistance Helpline (1-800-621-3362) and let them know. Read the decision letter carefully. If there's anything you don't understand or think is incorrect, call FEMA at the phone number on the letter."

          "description":"In some circumstances, your insurance and the FEMA funds you receive still are not enough to pay for the damage to your home. When you register with FEMA, you'll get an application for a disaster loan offered by the Small Business Administration (SBA). Use this loan to cover any additional disaster-related expenses that you have. FEMA individual disaster assistance does not cover business losses. If you own your own business, you'll likely want to take out the SBA loan if your insurance doesn't cover your expenses. If you own your home, you may be eligible for up to $200,000 to repair or replace your home along with an additional $40,000 to repair or replace your personal property.Tip: Completing the loan application can help you find out what other types of aid might be available to you. However, you are not required to accept the loan as a condition of accepting or applying for any other type of assistance."
