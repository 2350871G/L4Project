Whisk them together until the mixture becomes creamy. Add 3.5  c (830 mL) of all-purpose flour slowly, continually mixing as you add a little bit at a time. Slowly mix in 1.5  c (350 mL) of crushed potato chips. Spoon the mixture out into small balls on the baking sheet and place it in the oven. Bake for approximately 15 minutes, or until the cookies become golden brown. Let the cookies cool and then serve."

Spray the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan with non-stick spray and line the chips around the edge of the pan. Make sure you place them all the way up to the rim of the pie pan. Fill the pie with your favorite filling. Consider using chips with ridges because they look nicer and are less likely to break."

Melt 12 ounces of high-quality melting chocolate in the microwave \u2013 use low heat for about 90 seconds (or until completely melted). Dip the chips into the melted chocolate, and then place them on a piece of wax paper. Sprinkle with a bit of sea salt and let the covered chips sit at room temperature for about two hours. If your potato chips are broken into smaller pieces, you can drizzle the melted chocolate over the chip shards instead. If you are in a hurry, you can put the chocolate-covered chips in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes, instead of letting them sit at room temperature."
