In James Bond, every player starts at the same time as opposed to taking turns. Swapping Cards Try to get 4 of a kind in each of your piles to win the game. To play James Bond, swap the cards in your piles with the cards in the middle until you get 4 of a kind. The first person to get 4 of a kind in each hand is the winner, so race against the other players to see who can match their cards the fastest. You also are competing against the other players for the cards in the middle. They may want the same cards as you, so try to play as quickly as you can! Choose 1 of your piles to search through for a match. Grab any stack of cards you like, and look at all 4 of them. Note whether or not the cards in the center are the same as the cards in your hand. Do not look at 2 stacks of cards at the same time, as this is considered cheating. Perhaps the cards in the middle are a 4, 2, Ace, and 10 and the cards in your hand are a 5, 7, Ace, and 3. In this case, make a note of the Ace in both your pile and the center of the table. Swap 1 card in your hand for 1 card on the table to work on your set of 4. If 1 of the cards in the center is the same as the card in your hand, lay down another card and pick up the card you\u2019d like. Do this repetitively every time you find a card on the table that matches 1 in your hand. Be sure you only exchange 1 card at a time. For example, if you have an Ace in your hand and there\u2019s an Ace on the table, lay down another card in your hand and put the Ace card on the table in your pile. You'd ultimately want 4 Aces in that pile. Remember that you're not allowed to swap more than 1 card at a time. Move on to another one of your piles if you can't find any matches. Continue picking up and putting down piles in search of matching cards. If there is no matching card, put the pile face-down and move on to the next pile.

Try to keep track of what cards are in which piles. This way, you can quickly find your matches and complete each set of 4. Winning the Game Continue swapping cards until you get 4 of a kind in each stack. The game continues until 1 player has 4 of a kind in all of their piles. If you don't need any of the cards that are in the middle of the table, you may need to wait until someone plays a card that you can use. Yell out \u201cJames Bond!\u201d when you collect 4 of a kind in each stack. Do this as soon as you notice you have all piles with 4 of a kind. The first person who shouts out \u201cJames Bond!\u201d is the winner. At this point, the game is over and the other players must stop drawing cards. Show your cards to the other players to prove your victory. Flip all of your cards over one at a time to show each set of 4. If you say \u201cJames Bond\u201d without having the appropriate cards, you are technically not the winner and gameplay resumes. This way, you prove that you won the game fairly without cheating.",
