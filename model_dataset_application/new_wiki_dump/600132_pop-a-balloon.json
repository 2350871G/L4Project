Hold the balloon in 1 hand and turn on a lighter with the other hand, putting the flame close to the balloon until it pops. Always be extra cautious when dealing with fire and make sure that you know how to use a lighter or matches safely before using them at all."

This could be playing balloon darts where the balloons are secured to a board and you throw darts at the balloons to pop them, or trying to pop a balloon between your legs. Other games include standing back-to-back with someone with the balloon in the middle of your backs as you both try to pop the balloon by pushing back against each other."
