They will also be more comfortable and help you to sleep better. Make sure you're not allergic to feathers or down before you sleep on, or fluff up pillows containing them, though.

Feather pillows are the easiest to fluff, as they have the lightest fill material. For a feather pillow, simply hitting it lightly should do the trick. Take your pillow, and whack in on your bed a few times to even it out."

Move your hands down to about the center of the pillow, and perhaps a little bit above it. Now quickly squeeze, let go, and catch the pillow. Do this around five times. After squeezing the pillows, shake them strongly, and put them on your bed again and then beat the pillow with your flat hand on every side."

          "description":"You can throw the pillows in a dryer with something like a tennis ball. Even just running the pillow through the dryer should fluff it up. You could put your pillows in the dryer once a month. Put the tennis ball in a sock, tie the sock at the end, and throw them both in a dryer for a few minutes. The pillow will be fluffed and perfect for a good night\u2019s sleep. Try this method only if you haven\u2019t been able to fluff the pillow by hand. For cotton fill pillows, put the pillow in a dryer on low for 20 minutes, as this will take the place of you hitting your pillow repeatedly. The pillows should be completely dry when you remove them, and you can fluff them more by doing the fist blows. Use a low heat or air setting."

          "description":"Usually pillows lose their volume because of moisture, so the sun can help dry them and increase fluffiness. When fluffing pillows by hand (patting and molding the pillow) doesn\u2019t do the trick, you should leave your pillow out in the sun for a couple of hours. You could hang the pillows outside on a clothes line, if you have one. About three to four hours should be enough time to make sure the sun absorbs the moisture. By the way, it\u2019s also possible to wash your pillows, depending on the type of pillow."

Place your pillow on a flat surface. If it has lumps, bumps or dents, it\u2019s probably time to replace it. If you wake up with a sore neck, it\u2019s probably not providing you with enough support. Once pillows have been repeatedly crushed and the stuffing is flat due to moisture (likely sweat), you probably won't be able to return them to their original fluffiness. If the pillow smells of mildew, replace it. Fold your pillow in half and then see if it pops back into place. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s probably time to replace it."
