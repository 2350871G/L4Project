          "description":"A charcoal chimney is a metal cylinder which is used to get charcoal burning before adding it to a grill or smoker. Visit your local hardware store or look for a chimney online. Add the charcoal to the chimney and light it. Let it sit for about 15 minutes. The chimney will have its own instructions which you can follow to make sure the charcoal is lit properly. If you don\u2019t want to invest in a charcoal chimney, it\u2019s still important to heat the charcoal up in the smoker before you add the meat."

          "description":"On one side of the smoker, make a pile of unlit charcoal chunks. Slowly pour the hot charcoal on top of the unlit charcoal. It\u2019s important to set the charcoal up on one side of the smoker and then put the meat on the other side. Arranging your coals on one side and the meat on the other side of the smoker allows the meat to cook with indirect heat and smoke rather than with direct heat. Other options include setting piles of charcoal on both sides of the smoker and placing the meat in between them or making a circle of charcoal around the outside with meat in the middle."

          "headline":"Enhance the smoke with wood chunks.",
          "description":"Wood chunks and chips are used to give meat greater flavor. Chunks work better because they smolder for longer. Oak, apple, cherry and hickory woods are often used in smokers. Place the wood in the chimney with the charcoal, but set it off to the side of the charcoal when you add it to the smoker. Other woods can be used, but stick to hardwoods. Softwoods create a sooty smoke and will ruin the flavor of your meat."

          "headline":"Fill the water pan 3/4 full with cold water.",
          "description":"Smokers have a water pan included, but grills generally do not. Use a foil baking pan if you don\u2019t have a water pan. The water pan sits in the center section of the smoker, or on the grate opposite the meat in a grill. Without the water pan, you won't get as much vapor, which helps to evenly cook your meat and vegetables. Cold water is helpful to offset the initially higher temperature of the grill. The water helps regulate the temperature down to where you want it for the best smoking."

Regulate the temperature with the lower vent, depending on the what the smoker needs. If the fire is dying, open the lower vent more. If the temperature is getting too high, close it a little. Generally, the top (exhaust) vent should be left open the whole time. Only close it if adjusting the bottom vent does not change the temp the way you need it to."

You can increase the temperature by adding new coals to the charcoal pile. Reduce the temperature, if necessary, by closing the lower vent a little. This allows less oxygen to enter the smoker. If your smoker doesn\u2019t have a temperature gauge, stick the probe of an oven thermometer through a hole in the lid vent."

Only take the lid off if you need to add charcoal or add water to the water pan. It\u2019s okay to check on the meat to see how it is cooking and make sure there\u2019s enough coals, but only do this once an hour or so. Smoking is a slow and steady process. Smoking is a fairly hands off process, so rest assured that the meat is cooking without you checking it all the time."

It is helpful to keep an extra set of coals hot in the chimney in case you need to add them to the smoker. This works better than adding unlit charcoal on top of the spent coals. If you don\u2019t have a chimney, use a foil baking pan to keep some extra coals hot."
