Look for any metal items that could be causing the rust and remove them or replace them so they are rust resistant. Though a fixture may be made of materials that are rust-resistant, like aluminum or brass, the screws, bolts, or other fasteners may not be rust-resistant. They can then cause rust to appear.

You should look for any rusted nails in the painted surface and replace them with new nails. Use a nail punch to countersink the nails so they are \u215b\u201d below the surface. This will prevent the nails from retaining moisture from the air outside and rusting. You can then fill any holes in the painted surface with putty to prevent water from getting into the painted surface. Make sure the painted surface is smooth and rust free before you paint over it."
