Create a group with your Clan's name. Manage the rooms. For example, categorize your rooms with this template. Chat Rooms: Room for free chat. These are rather used to chat outside the game. Game Rooms: Rooms for gaming chat. These are used to chat inside the game. Make sure to make multiple game rooms. Admin Rooms: A room where the Clan's leaders make their conferences. Give away ranks and stars to members. Right click on the member in Raidcall and click on Edit Membership Name and give him or her a tag that shows the rank in the Clan. You could use this Template: [Trainee] [Clan Member] [Clan Pro Member] [Clan Founder] [Clan Administrator] [Clan Leader]. However, it's all up to you. Give administration permissions to leaders and administrators."
