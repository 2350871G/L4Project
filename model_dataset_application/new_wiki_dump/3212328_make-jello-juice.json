  "text":" Preparation Buy your packaged Jell-O. You can get these very cheap at places such as Walmart, Target, Safeway, or your local grocery store. Check it out in the frozen foods aisle. For a rainbow effect and variety of different flavors, get several different kinds. Perhaps some cherry, lime, and grape mixes? Delish! Set up your work space. Although not much room is needed for this task, when working in the kitchen and getting a bit messy, it's always easier for you to tidy up in the beginning than for you to clean up what looks like tornado wreckage afterwards. After setting aside a few things, let the fun commence! Method One Making the Jell-O drinks. This way is for those who want a single flavour per glass. Carefully open the package to ensure spills aren't made and begin to pour the contents into a large glass - or glasses if you've decided to make multiple. How much you put in is another question, but you really don't need too much. Start with a little, and if doesn't look like enough, add some more. Fill your cup(s) with water. Filtered water is usually best, although it really doesn't matter. Some folks even boil their water first, but this only firms the jello when you add ice. If that's what you're going for, be my guest! Mix it up well. The little bitty contents of the jello will linger around for a bit, so it's best to mix em' for a minute or two. Garnish! Garnish however you please. Maybe take some whipped cream on top, put some sprinkles on that bad boy. Or, for a refreshing serenade, add some ice and lemon. Throw a fruity umbrella in there and you're set for the beach! Or maybe just set for a day of watching Netflix and sleeping. Of course all of this is optional so you don't have to. Method Two Use several small containers. This is for all you rainbow/science lovers out there and is also really fun to do with the kids. Put in the same amount of water in each one, preferably exact. Around four centimeters (~1.5 inches) should do it. Now, take a small tablespoon and take a large amount of any chosen flavour. For white/clear color, use sugar for this part. This is the bottom layer. Put in the most jello powder in one container and mix. Do the same thing in the previous step, decreasing the amount of powder in each one. This is decreasing the fluids amount (or mass, you science lover). The less on the top, most on the bottom. (It is best not to put dark colours with each other, but you can if you would like to.) Take a small baster from your kitchen, and suck up the first container, with the largest batch. Carefully, along the edge of the glass and close to the bottom, allow it to slowly drip until the baster is empty. Repeat. Do this with all of the other containers, slowly and carefully.
