Fire ant bait is designed to act slowly, so that the queen will also be targeted. The instructions that come with the fire ant bait will specify the amount to use and the best placement."

Mound treatments contain acephate, which is a slow-acting poison that will eventually kill the fire ants. The fire ants will eat the poison and share it with the queen, which works to slowly wipe out the whole colony. Mound treatments won't work once they get wet, so try to pick a sunny day. Mound treatments will only work on the mound that it encircles. You will have to repeat the treatment around each individual mound. You can get fire ant mound treatments from gardening centers."

This solution is best if you have to deal with multiple mounds that are spread across a larger area. A lawn treatment will usually rid your lawn of fire ants for a full season.You can buy these from gardening stores. It is necessary to use a push spreader to apply the lawn treatment, as applying it by hand is very difficult. If you don't have one, many rental yards and plant nurseries loan them out.
