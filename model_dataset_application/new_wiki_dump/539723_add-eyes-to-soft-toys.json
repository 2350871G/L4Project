      "description":"If you are making an animal, the eyes should be representative of the animal. More human-like eyes are suitable for dolls. Some eyes will change the mood, look, or character of the toy, so it is a good idea to hold up different sets of eyes to see what overall look is created."

Some ideas include:\nEmbroidering eyes\nSewing on beads or buttons\nMaking raised eyes out of the same fabric as the toy, with felt additions\nSafety lock eyes\nGoogly eyes (glued on firmly, not suitable for under 5's)\nMarker or fabric paint drawn eyes (but be careful or this can look kitsch)"

      "description":"They should look as realistic as possible and should be spaced as they would be on a real human or animal, or at least give a sense of perspective to a human viewer. Consider the possibilities of how eyes come across through positioning; for example, eyes that are large and wide apart have an innocent and naive look, whereas eyes positioned closely together can look stern and mean. Play around a bit before settling on the final positioning."
