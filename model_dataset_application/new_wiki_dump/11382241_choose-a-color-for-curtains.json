Consider the color palette of the walls, furniture, and accent pieces. Plan on picking curtains that accentuate the rest of the room. For example, if the room is filled with expressive artwork and heavy wood furniture, heavier drapes would look more at home than sheer curtains would."

If you\u2019re struggling with color inspiration, visit a home improvement store and check out the paint sample swatches\u2014they will show you a range of different colors that complement each other. For example, dark burgundy curtains would look very elegant in a room with light purple paint, wood furniture, and accent shades of purple."

Choose curtains that are that same color to tie the room together. For example, if the room is primarily gray and tan with accents of yellow throughout, yellow curtains or curtains with a yellow pattern could work well."

This creates contrast so that the curtains don\u2019t just blend in with the walls; instead, they\u2019ll stand out and look neat and tailored. Don\u2019t forget that you could also layer curtains. For example, using sheer white curtains behind navy blue ones could create a bright, fresh-looking layer, especially when just the navy blue curtains are pulled back."

If your furniture is also neutrally colored, choosing similar curtains will create a calm atmosphere. Consider sticking to the same color scheme as the furniture, or pick a brighter color or pattern to add some visual interest to the space. For example, dark gray curtains would look striking against white or beige walls in a room with light gray furniture."

For example, if you have a lot of stripes in a room, adding striped curtains may be a little disorienting. But if you use curtains with a floral pattern, the contrast between the strips and flowers could be cool."

Plus, they can make a small room appear larger than it is. Sheer curtains allow more natural light to enter a room. White curtains of a thicker material still elevate the space, but they look a little more formal and need to be cleaned more often because dust and dirt are more visible on them."

          "description":"If you prefer a splash of color, curtains are a great way to instantly give a room a facelift. Use solid colored curtains or patterned ones, just depending on the decor already in the space. Color can impact your mood, so consider the following when making your decision:\nRed is a warm and passionate color that is great for spaces where people gather together, like kitchens and living rooms. Orange often energizes people, so it\u2019s best for offices, living rooms, or common gathering spaces. Avoid using it in bedrooms as it could be overstimulating. Yellow can be cheerful and warm. It plays well in kitchens and offices, but too much of it could be overstimulating so avoid using it in rooms where you want things to be calm.Tip: Avoid putting brightly colored curtains in rooms that receive a lot of sunlight. The sun will fade the color over time, making the curtains look dull and uneven. If you do want to go for a bright color in a sunny room, pick curtains made of faux silk, brocade, cotton canvas, or chintzes."

Try to use them in rooms that get some natural sunlight, otherwise, they can sometimes make a room feel smaller or claustrophobic. Green is a great color that calms people down, as it is reminiscent of nature. Bedrooms, offices, living rooms, and dining rooms are great places to use green curtains. Blue is a calm, serene color. It\u2019s great for bedrooms and bathrooms. Purple is generally a deeper and more elegant shade that invites people to sit and relax. It\u2019s great for living rooms and dining rooms. Lighter purples can be very calming and good picks for bedrooms."

You could match a color that is already present, like putting up light pink pastel curtains in a room that has lots of red in it, or you could go off-book and do something like light green pastel curtains in a room that is predominantly blue. Pastels also look great in rooms that are already fairly neutral in color. They support the calm atmosphere while still creating a slight visual impact."

Choose monochrome curtains if you want a unified and soothing space. Don\u2019t worry about matching the curtains exactly to the color of the walls. As long as they are close, the effect should be the same. Look up photos of monochromatic rooms for inspiration\u2014you\u2019ll see that whites, grays, and yellows are the more commonly used colors, but some striking spaces utilize blues, yellows, and other brighter colors."

For example, if the room has a lot of white furniture and decor, think about installing black curtains. If you like a more colorful space, consider using yellow curtains in a predominantly purple space or mixing pink and blue. As long as you like the result, you can choose whatever combination you like best. Remember that you can always switch out your curtains if you get tired of the feel of a room."

You could choose curtains that complement the existing color scheme, or pick a pattern with contrasting colors to create a more eclectic and energized space. This can be a nice way to transform a room if you aren\u2019t able to paint the walls."
