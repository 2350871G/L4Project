Each collection contains a different percentage chance of having a rare card, so knowing how you bought your cards can help locate rare ones.

Secret cards are not officially listed as part of the collection. You can find the collection number as a fraction in the bottom right corner of the card. When the number before the slash is larger than the one following it, you have a secret card. Among rare cards, there are sometimes even rarer cards. For example, nearly all holofoil cards are rare, but there's an even rarer variety, the holofoil rare, which is indicated by a star in the lower right corner of the card. Some cards contain small printing errors that make the card especially rare. These are often worth huge sums of money.

Your local hobby shop might have an announcement board on which you can advertise the card you're trying to sell. If your hobby shop has one of these, ask if you can advertise on it.

In this case, you might take your card off the market, then put it on the market with a price lower in your selling range. Try to keep your selling range to yourself.
