          "description":"When it comes to creating a Parisian-style room, it\u2019s all about contrasting lighter colors against black. Therefore, opt for a lighter wall color that will contrast with black furniture and accent pieces. A light color, such as pink or blue, is a great choice. You can create the same contrast by doing black walls with colorful bedding and accent pieces, but proceed with caution. Black walls can make a room look dark, small, and dreary, so it needs to be done very well!"

Amazon is a great resource. Choose something like the iconic Eiffel Tower, a scene from a French caf\u00e9, French script, or all of the above. There are hundreds of options, and luckily they aren\u2019t very expensive! Hanging posters can add a bit of fun to plain walls as well."

          "description":"You can be creative with these. A faux fur rug can add a dash of glamor to your room, while a patterned rug can add an element of high fashion fun. A solid colored rug will let your Paris-themed accent pieces stand out, but a floral rug can add a soft, romantic touch to your bedroom. Be creative and choose a rug that fits the specific Parisian vibe you are going for! These rugs will also help make your room much more cozy, especially if you have hard floors."

Upholstered headboards look girly and romantic, while wrought iron beds look delicate and chic. If you\u2019re unable to buy a new bed, don\u2019t worry\u2014 the perfect bedding can turn any bed into a cozy little piece of Paris. If your walls are painted a sweet pastel color, top your bed with a black and white patterned, or a plain white, comforter. This will create a beautiful contrast. If your walls are a stark white or black, choose a colored comforter. Just make sure that, somehow, your bedding and your walls create a nice contrast between solid neutrals and color."

          "description":"You can certainly be creative with this. If you have a plain wooden night stand, paint it the same color as your walls for a pop of color that ties the room together. A delicate, wrought-iron side table can mimic the look of a Parisian caf\u00e9 table, and would look ultra-sophisticated in your Parisian room. If you don\u2019t want to purchase a new Paris-inspired side table and aren\u2019t able to repaint the one you have, consider draping a beautiful fabric over the side table, like a tablecloth. Voila\u2014 a perfect Parisian night table."

You can find these online at stores like Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel, but don\u2019t be afraid to scout Goodwill, garage sales, and vintage stores as well. With a coat of paint and a little TLC, you can bring a cheap, rickety vanity back to life. Set your makeup and perfume bottles on your vanity. This way the vanity serves a purpose and provides a spot for you to get ready, but looks chic and Parisian at the same time!"

These are cheap accent pieces that can really bring together your Parisian theme. Opt for a mix of colored pillows and black and white pillows of different shapes and sizes. Romantic pillows like lips and hearts look great, especially mixed with pillows of French phases and images.

Just make sure that the bottom of the chandelier is no lower than seven feet, so adults avoid bumping their heads!"
