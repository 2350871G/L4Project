          "description":"Many people swear that a grilled steak, with a little salt and pepper, is one of nature's finest meals. Strip steaks are naturally tender, and only need to be seared on the outside to remain flavorful and juicy. Depending on your grill, you can get very different flavors from your steak:\n\nPropane: Gas grills impart little flavor on the meat, but are very easy to control. You can adjust the temperatures with a simple knob, allowing you to perfect the cooking process. They also heat up much faster than wood or charcoal. Charcoal: Briquettes light up quickly and get hot quickly, and they impart a rich, smoky flavor on the meat. Wood-fire: Wood chips, like hickory or oak, often give the best natural flavor to the meat, but they are harder to maintain and light. Many people use a mixture of charcoal and wood instead of just wood-chops."

          "description":"If you are using charcoal and/or wood this might take 30-40 minutes (most of the briquettes should be covered in gray ash), but propane grills will only take a few minutes. If you have a thermometer, aim to have the inside of the grill around 400\u00b0F. The thinner the steak, the hotter you want the grill, since you don't want to completely cook the inside of the steak before the outside is nice and browned:\n\n1/2 inch thick: 425-450\u00b0F. You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill for more than 3 seconds. 3/4-1 inch thick: 360-400\u00b0F You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill for more than 4-5 seconds. 1-1 1/2 inch thick: 325-360\u00b0F You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill for more than 5-6 seconds."

Rub 1/2 tablespoon of both salt and crushed black pepper on both sides of the steak and let it sit at room temperature for 15-20 minutes while the grill heats. To determine the amount of salt, think of it as a light snow on an asphalt road -- you can see the road, but the snow (salt) is covering most of it. Bigger kernels of salt, like coarse sea salt or kosher salt, will help the outside caramelize better, so avoid using fine table salt if you can."

For reference:\n\nMedium rare steaks should be grilled for roughly 7 minutes a side. Medium steaks should be grilled for roughly 10 minutes a side. Well done steaks should be cooked for ten minutes on each side, then left on indirect heat to keep cooking. Use tongs to turn the steak, as piercing it with a fork causes the juices to leak out."

You can use a meat thermometer to gauge the meat, or just estimate with time. Rare: 130 \u00b0F (54 \u00b0C) to 135 \u00b0F (57 \u00b0C). Remove immediately after flipping each side. Medium-Rare: 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C). Sear each side for an extra minute longer than you would for a rare steak. Medium: 155 \u00b0F (68 \u00b0C).
