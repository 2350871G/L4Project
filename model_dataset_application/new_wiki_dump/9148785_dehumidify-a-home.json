One of the air conditioner's primary jobs is to dehumidify the air, so turning it on can make your home drier. It's important to use the \"auto\" setting instead of just the \"on\" setting. The \"on\" setting leaves the air blowing all the time, even when the air is not cooling, which means the collected moisture doesn't have a chance to drain off. The \"auto\" setting switches off the fan when it's not cooling, so water can drain to the outside."

In fact, even food cooked in a skillet can add moisture to the air. Try to keep your showers short, and turn the heat down as much as possible. Try covering your pots so the moisture stays mostly in the pot. Also, remove some plants. If you have too many plants in your house, it can create a jungle-like atmosphere. They can produce a good deal of moisture, especially if you water them too much. Try sticking to just a couple of plants. You can also move them outside or keep them in a single room."

You'll need enough rock salt to fill a 5-gallon (19-liter) bucket, plus two 5-gallon (19-liter) buckets. In one bucket, drill holes all along the sides and bottom of the bucket. You'll need 25 to 30 holes. Set the drilled bucket in the intact bucket; they will be stacked together, but you should have space at the bottom between the two for run-off. Pour in the rock salt. The salt will absorb moisture from the air, which will drip into the bottom bucket. Set the bucket in a room that needs to be dehumidified. You'll need to place one in each room to dehumidify a home.
