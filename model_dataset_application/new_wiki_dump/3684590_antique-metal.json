  "text":" Antiquing Metal with Chemical Oxidizers Choose a chemical oxidizer designed for the particular metal (silver, brass, etc.) you are antiquing. Most store-bought oxidizers contain muriatic or hydrochloric acid as the primary corrosive agent. Prepare your work area. You\u2019ll need to work outdoors or in a well-ventilated area of your home as the fumes from chemical oxidizers can be toxic. Cover exposed surfaces, including the floor and table in thick, protective plastic sheets. Wear thick rubber gloves and safety goggles. Place a gallon of water and some baking soda or ammonia nearby in case you need to quickly neutralize spilled acid.  Move other metal objects to another room. Even the fumes from the process can oxidize and damage them. Dilute the chemical oxidizer. Use a glass container (not metal, plastic or wood) to mix 1 part oxidizer to 20 parts water to begin and strengthen gradually as needed. Soak the metal objects by placing them into oxidizing solution carefully. Keep them in the solution until they achieve a desired darkness or blackness, typically a few seconds to 1 or 2 minutes. You can also apply the solution with a brush or cotton swab to control coloration. Remove the objects from the oxidizing solution. Then cover them in baking soda or ammonia to neutralize the acid and stop the oxidizing process. Rinse the items with clean water and dry them with a clean cloth towel.  Restore a shine to selective parts of the metal objects by rubbing with fine steel wool, in order to provide contrast and an authentically worn look. Alternatively, you can tumble small items in a rotary tumbler with steel shot to brighten and shine parts of the metal. Antiquing Metal with Liver of Sulfur Prepare your workspace. Cover a work table with a thick plastic sheet, and wear protective rubber gloves and safety goggles. Prepare the liver of sulphur. Heat 1 to 2 cups (237 to 474 mL) to a boil and pour the water in a heatproof glass bowl or disposable container. Then, add a pea-size amount of liver of sulphur and mix. Also known as potassium sulfide, liver of sulphur comes in a variety of forms, including liquid, gel and solid. Prime the metal for antiquing. Create a texture or \u201ctooth\u201d on the surfaces you wish to antique by rubbing with a piece of sandpaper between 9 and 15-grit. Clean the metal with a paste of pumice and water, then rinse.  Apply the liver of sulphur mixture with a soft, round brush sized according to the area you wish to antique. You can also place the entire object in mixture until the desired color is achieved. Rinse the object with cold water to stop the oxidation process.  Finish the antiquing process by brushing the metal with a soft brass brush and a gentle dish detergent to even out the finish. Use a polishing cloth if you wish to further lighten some of the oxidized areas. Antiquing Metal with Hard Boiled Eggs Place 1 to 6 eggs (depending on the amount of metal) in a pot of water and bring to a boil. Then turn off heat and leave in hot water for about 10 minutes. Remove the egg shells immediately and carefully.  Cut the eggs in quarters while still hot and place in a clear (glass or plastic) container with metal. Prevent the egg from touching metal directly and cover the container. Egg yolks produce sulfur that will oxidize the metal. Monitor the oxidizing process without opening the container every 5 to 10 minutes initially. Then leave the metal in the container with the eggs for one to two hours at room temperature or overnight if placed in refrigerator until desired coloration is reached. Remove the metal from the container and discard the eggs. Allow the metal objects to air out to remove the sulfuric egg smell. Rub a polishing cloth or steel wool to lighten certain oxidized areas of the metal objects to create a naturally-worn look. ",
