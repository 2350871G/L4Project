      "description":"People install 90 percent of all hot tubs outside on a patio or deck. Of the 10 percent installed inside a home, most go in the master suite, an enclosed sun room or a finished basement. Measure the hot tub area to ensure a comfortable fit. Be sure to allow enough room for getting in and out of the tub. Allow extra room if you plan to use steps. Check the room for sufficient ventilation. Hot tubs installed inside the home create steam, which may result in mildew and other problems. Look for an electrical outlet near the tub location. Be sure your service meets your hot tub requirement. Most hot tubs require a 220v electrical hook-up, however this varies from hot tub to hot tub."
