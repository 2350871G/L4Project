          "description":"Before using a needle outside of a healthcare facility, purchase an FDA-approved personal use a sharps disposal container online, at your local pharmacy, or from a medical supply establishment. In some cases, your doctor may supply you with a sharps disposal container along with the needles needed to self-administer your medication. In some places, you aren't legally required to use an approved sharps disposal container. In those cases, you can legally use a sturdy plastic container with a screw-on lid, such as an empty laundry detergent bottle. However, this is generally not recommended because of the injury and health risks it poses to garbage haulers and facility workers. FDA-approved sharps disposal containers generally cost less than $10 USD."

          "headline":"Place the sharps container nearby.",
          "description":"When you\u2019re using a needle to administer medication, make sure that you place the sharps disposal container next to you or very close by. This will reduce the risk of injuring yourself or someone else by walking around with the exposed used needle, and will eliminate the need for you to set the needle down or store it anywhere else. Needles are generally very thin and small and, therefore, can easily be lost. Positioning the sharps disposal container next to you will make it easier for you to dispose of the needle properly and minimize the risks to yourself and others."

          "headline":"Place the needle in the container immediately after use.",
          "description":"First, open the top of the sharps disposal container so the disposal chute is exposed. Then, immediately after using the needle according to your doctor\u2019s instructions, place the needle carefully in the disposal chute with the sharp end facing down. Once the needle is fully inside the container, close the lid. Make sure that the lid is closed properly and securely before moving the container."

Make sure the container has a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid and can stand upright when in use. The container itself should be leak-proof and puncture-resistant as well. Once the container is about 3/4 full, dispose of it according to your community guidelines as you would with an official FDA-approved container."

You can then throw the rest of the syringe away in the trash. The needle will be stored within the clipper until you dispose of it in a sharps container.Tip: The safest way to dispose of used needles is to place them in a sharps disposal container immediately. However, if you don\u2019t have access to a sharps container, you can clip or recap the needles until you\u2019re able to get an appropriate container. The syringe is the part that holds the medication, while the needle is the pointy end used to pierce your skin or veins. While syringes can legally and safely be disposed of in the trash, they cannot be placed in the recycling even if the materials are recyclable. While you\u2019ll still need a sharps disposal container after using needle cutters, they will cut down on the amount of waste you put into the container. As a result, you\u2019ll be able to use the container for longer and reduce the number of containers you\u2019ll need to dispose of and purchase each year."

Once the needle is destroyed, you can dispose of the remaining syringe and needle particles in the trash. The way in which you operate a needle grinder varies depending on the type of grinder you purchase. Therefore, make sure that you read the instructions carefully before using the grinder.
