Don\u2019t assume that every plant wants 1 quart of water every two days because all of your plants won\u2019t thrive like that. Some may prefer to have their soil fairly dry most of the time, while others need it moist. Some may need the soil to dry out in between waterings."

          "headline":"Let the plant determine when you water it.",
          "description":"Although it may be easiest to water on a set routine that you have decided, plants are not likely to thrive when watered this way. So rather than watering every two days, get a feel for how often your plant needs water. Check the soil consistently and learn how often it tends to dry out and water on that schedule. Even indoor plants tend to have a dormant stage during the winter, so it is likely they will not need to be watered as often during this time. Morning tends to be a good time to water your plants. Watering at night can cause your plants to develop diseases more easily because the plant does not have time to dry before the temperature cools."

          "headline":"Perform the finger test.",
          "description":"Stick a finger in the soil up to your first knuckle and notice if the soil is moist enough. If you finger can\u2019t even enter the soil, it definitely needs to be watered. If you reach an inch or so deep but your finger is completely dry, it probably needs water. If the top inch feels fairly moist, and some of the dirt sticks to your finger, it probably has enough water. Again, this is not a guarantee for every plant. But most of the time if the top portion of soil is dried out, the plant could use some more water. You can buy a moisture meter that sticks in the soil and tells you when the plant needs water, which might be helpful and save guesswork."

          "headline":"Watch the leaves.",
          "description":"Leaves can be a good indication of both under and overwatering. If the leaves seem to be hanging limp, this often means the plant needs water. If they are brown, dry, or some have fallen out, this usually means the plant needs water. These signs mean that something is very wrong. Do not wait until your plant develops these signs before you water them. If the plant is dried out, water it slowly. Giving it too much water all at once might kill it. These same signs can sometimes mean the plant has been overwatered, so use this in conjunction with checking the soil. If you know you just watered it that day, give the plant time to absorb and use that water before watering it again."

          "description":"You can test if your plant has enough water by lifting it after you have just watered it and noticing how heavy it feels. Lift it periodically, and when it doesn\u2019t feel heavy enough, you\u2019ll know it needs some water. It\u2019s more of an art than a science, but this can be good trick to master. This is only a good test for plants that are light enough to pick up and if you have the strength to do so. It\u2019s not worth straining yourself just to check."

Soft water may have too much salt. Tap water may be too alkaline. If you use a certain water for a while and it doesn\u2019t seem to be keeping your plants healthy, it\u2019s probably time to switch. If you can store a container outside to catch rainwater, this is a great option since it\u2019s what the plants would get naturally. If you happen to live somewhere that has acid rain, this won\u2019t work. Melted snow is also a good option if you live in colder climates with little rain. Bottled water can also be a good option, although this may be too costly. For city water, you can fill an open container and let the water sit for a day or so, which allows the chemicals to evaporate before you use it on your plants."

This way, the water can warm up to a standard temperature rather than whatever temperature it would be from the tap or from rainwater. Most plants tend to prefer tepid water over cold water. If you have multiple plants and need a lot of water, consider keeping a few jugs, or watering cans, stored somewhere that you can keep filled and ready for when you need them."

Some plants can also benefit from misting the leaves, since watering mainly affects the roots. It is important to know your plant, however. Some leaves actually won\u2019t benefit from misting, and some plants may even be harmed from getting their leaves wet."

If it becomes a real problem, consider repotting in a new container that has better drainage. Try moving the pot to a warmer location so that it will dry more quickly.

Extra water can pool there and won\u2019t be in direct contact with the soil and roots. The stone layer should be an inch or so deep. Be extra careful not to overwater your plants.
