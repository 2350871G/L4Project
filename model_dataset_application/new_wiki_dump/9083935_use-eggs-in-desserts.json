A French-style custard, pastry cream, is usually cooked on the stove. If you'd like a thicker dessert, you can make a pudding by including cornstarch in the custard base. You can pipe pastry cream onto tarts or inside pastries for a creamy filling."

It's actually really simple to whisk up an egg yolk, cream, and sugar base that's baked in individual ramekins. To serve creme brulee, bake the custards and then top them with sugar (brown sugar works well). Broil or torch the tops to create a hard sugar topping. Or turn the flan out so a caramel sauce covers the custards. Once you've made the basic creme brulee or flan, experiment with your favorite flavors. For example, try a coffee flan or an earl grey creme brulee."

While you can add as few or as many yolks as you like, more egg yolks will make the ice cream base creamier and more custard-like. For example, you can make a fantastic French vanilla ice cream that will be pale yellow and very dense. Ice creams that use a lot of egg yolks also take longer to melt."

You can make lemon or any flavor fruit curd by whisking egg yolks and sugar over low heat. Whisk in fruit juice or puree and then slowly add butter. Cook and stir the fruit curd until it thickens. You can use the curd to flavor whipped cream or pastry cream. To make a simple dessert with your fruit curd, spread some over a tart and top it with meringue or whipped cream, much like a key lime pie."

To make Swiss meringue, beat the egg whites and sugar over heat. Keep beating the meringue until it's firm. To make an Italian meringue, beat egg whites and slowly pour in a hot sugar syrup until it's firm. For a cross between a meringue and marshmallows, make marshmallow fluff.

Turn off the oven and keep the meringues in it until they're cool. This will dry them out so they become crisp. Macarons are similar to individual meringues, but the egg white mixture also contains ground almonds."
