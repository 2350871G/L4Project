  "text":" Wire hairpins Obtain fine wire hairpins. These are also known as \"invisible\" hairpins; they have large bends and small beaded tips. The benefit of these hairpins is that they are sharp and fine, making them easy to push through the fabric without damaging it, whilst remaining invisible to the eye. Loop the lace curtain over the curtain rod. Use about 3cm (1.5\") of fabric to make the fold over the rod. It can help if you use sewing pins temporarily to keep the folded over lace in place while you work; remove the pins as you go. Push the hairpins through the looped fabric of the curtain, straight up and down, just under the rod. Face the rounded head at the top, the beaded ends hanging down. Be sure to catch both sides of the looped lace fabric. Work your way methodically down the entire length of the curtain rod. Pin at even intervals, to ensure adequate coverage and a strong hold. Adjust as needed. When you reach the other end, hang the curtain rod and curtain back up. Stitching lace curtain heading tape Sew on heading tape. Have the lace curtain already made up, ready for the header tape to be added. The curtain must be the length you want, plus 3 centimeter (1.2 in) for turning under. Turn under 3 centimeter (1.2 in) at the curtain's top and press.  Knot the cords at one end of the heading tape.  Pin the tape close to the top of the curtain, covering the raw fabric edges. Fold under the short edges of the tape. Stitch using the sewing machine. Run the stitch right along all edges of the tape. Draw up the tape to fit the window. Knot the cords. Hang the lace curtain over the rod. Repeat for the other curtain(s). Rustic stitching Loop the lace curtain over the curtain rod. Run a line of pins down to keep the loop in place while stitching. Select a yarn that matches the color of the lace closely. Thread a large needle with the yarn. Stitch around the curtain rod to bring both sides of the looped lace fabric together. Leave the stitching very loose each time you bring up the next stitch. Knot off the ends to prevent unraveling. Hang the curtain rod and curtain back up.  To remove the curtain, either slip the curtain off, or cut the yarn and weave the yarn out of the lace fabric. ",
