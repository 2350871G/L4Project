          "description":"Take a 12 in (30 cm) square of patterned scrapbook paper and fold it diagonally both ways to crease it. Unfold the paper and fold both sets of straight edges together, then unfold it again. Use a pair of scissors to cut about 2.5 in (6.4 cm) inward from each straight edge and fold the flaps together into triangles. Glue the edges of the flaps together and watch the paper transform into a multi-dimensional star!Use lots of different colors and patterns of scrapbook paper to build your own dazzling paper solar system. If you want to hang your completed stars, glue 2 stars together on their backsides to make a single star with 8 evenly-spaced points, then attach a string to one of the points and suspend them from the ceiling."
