          "description":"Whether it\u2019s morning or night, you want your relaxing in bedtime to just be you and your bed (and maybe a cup of tea or a book). Anything else should be turned off and put away. Turn your alarm clock away from you, turn off your phone, shut your computer, and lock the door. Having electronics on cues our bodies to stay on the alert. Apart from the light that they emit (that messes with our sleep-awake cycle), they keep us thinking about the million things we have to do. Get rid of them and your brain may be able to shut off, too. To help with this, try staying away from all electronics and artificial light sources that would keep your brain awake for at least one hour before you go to bed. Alright, so the one caveat here is TV if done correctly. We\u2019ll talk about how to do this the right way in the next section."

          "description":"If it\u2019s Sunday morning and you\u2019re looking for a luxurious lie-in, throw open the curtains and get your room filled with natural light. Soak up that vitamin D from the sun and let the light warm the room. If it\u2019s at night, match the lighting to your needs. If you\u2019re reading a book, turn on a lamp by your bed. Apart from that, have the lighting be dim. If you don\u2019t intend to sleep, you can have the lighting be a bit brighter, but it shouldn\u2019t be anything that offends your retinas."

Not only does this program your body to go into sleep mode, but recent science says it can also up your metabolism and even regulate your insulin levels (helping fight against diabetes). If that\u2019s not reason enough, what is? If you don\u2019t want to fall asleep, make the temperature a little higher, but not too high. You want that sweet spot where your body wants to climb under the covers but not fall asleep. It\u2019ll likely be somewhere around 69\u00b0 (20\u00b0C)."

If you don\u2019t take essential oils yourself, you can put them in a diffuser and fill the room with a scent that tells your body it\u2019s time to relax. Why not let your nose do the work? Some good scents are lavender, petitgrain, chamomile, geranium, sandalwood and rose. However, any scent you enjoy could put you in zen garden mode."

Get out of presentation mode and into your pajamas. Or heck, into your birthday suit. You should adjust the temperature to match the clothes you\u2019re wearing. If you\u2019re wearing long johns and a sweater to bed, the room can be a bit colder. If you\u2019re going like the day you were born, you may want to make it a little warmer."

But what most of us don't know is that journaling can actually reduce anxiety and stress \u2013 in fact, journaling about our worries helps get rid of them and helps us perform better in daily life. If you didn't have a reason to journal before, why not do it for your mental health? If you have a notebook and pen in hand but don't know quite what to write about, look out the window for inspiration. What do you hear? What kind of trees are those? Those birds, what are they?

You could sit in bed with an avocado face mask on while you paint your nails, put a hot oil mixture on your hair, or just lie down with a heated massage pad and soak the moment in. Sometimes there's too much on our minds to spend time primping. If that rings true for you, instead, take this time to organize your mind, writing down to-do lists, planning out your budget or meals for the week, and just getting a firm hold on the steering wheel of your life.

If this sounds familiar, don\u2019t try to unwind with your favorite crime drama or even the news (since most of it is so negative). Stick to something light and cheerful to keep your brain light and cheerful. Your favorite old-school sitcom is a good bet. Find a program where you can turn your brain off and enjoy the laughs. Avoid the ones that make you worry or evoke a negative emotional reaction, like fear or anger."

Passionflower and chamomile are especially good if you\u2019re looking to go to sleep, and green tea is good for destressing and getting rid of anger.

Just a little bit (about an ounce and a half) has been shown to reduce cortisol levels, which is the hormone in your body that produces stress. It may also be able to help regulate your metabolism. Mango. This fruit has high amounts of linalool, which has also been shown to be a serious stress-buster. Chewing gum. And it doesn\u2019t matter the flavor, either. Just a few minutes of chewing can help lower stress levels, or so recent science has shown. Anything crunchy. Stressed individuals tend to crave crunchy things, and it seems that crunching away can be a stress-reducer. So grab a handful of nuts or celery and start working on your peace of mind."

Focusing on this can take you to an entirely different place mentally \u2013 a stress-free place of calm. Try starting out with breathing in for four beats and breathing out for eight.

Slowly but surely move up your body until every bit of you is consciously relaxed. Progressive tension release. For this type of relaxation, take a deep breath in.

Tons of research has denoted that meditation helps alleviate levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. And you don't have to sit-up and say, \"ommm,\" either.
