At finer restaurants, the chef will apply the soy sauce themselves so you don't have to. If your chef doesn't add soy sauce to a dish, you can add some yourself. Pour only 1/4 teaspoon or so into the shallow dish provided by the restaurant, then dip (but don't dunk) one edge or corner of the fish (not the rice) into the soy sauce. If you're eating a sushi roll, it is not possible to dip the fish without dipping the rice, so just dip one edge of the roll into the soy sauce.
