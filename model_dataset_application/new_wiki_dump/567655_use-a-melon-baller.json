Wash the knife and melon baller in hot, soapy water. Don't wash the melon until you're ready to cut it, as a wet rind may encourage mold. Avoid soap and detergent, which may penetrate to the flesh. Produce washes are harmless, but unnecessary."

If your melon balls still aren't satisfactory, rotate two full rotations before you remove the scoop. If you're using a baller with a plastic scoop or handle, don't apply too much force. These may break if used on dense fruits."
