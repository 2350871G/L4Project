      "description":"Place the frying pan on a medium heat. Add a splash of oil and the butter. When the butter has melted and starts to foam, pour the eggs into the pan. Gently move the pan to spread the mixture evenly and use the spatula to loosen the edge of the omelette. Once the omelette has started to form use the spatula to break up the middle so that the uncooked egg fills the space. This will ensure that the omelette cooks evenly. Cook until the egg is set but not solid and remove from the heat."
