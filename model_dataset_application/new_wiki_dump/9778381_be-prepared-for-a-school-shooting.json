See how close they are to you and whether there are any obstacles, like desks or chairs, that might slow you down if you have to get to the door quickly. This seems easy, since you walk through your classroom doors almost every day, but reviewing their location will help it become second nature and make it easier to remember in an emergency. If you can evacuate safely, this is often considered the best option for getting away from a school shooting. However, each scenario is different. If you know you can\u2019t run away safely, stay in place and hide."

Watch how your teacher opens and closes the windows, and volunteer to help them to see how it\u2019s done. You could even stay behind a few minutes after class to practice opening and closing the windows quickly. Ask your teacher first, explaining to them that you want to be as prepared as possible in case of an emergency.

Figure this out for each of your classes so you can be prepared just in case you need to make a quick getaway. Do the same thing for anywhere else that you spend a lot of time on campus, such as the cafeteria, gym, or sports fields."

Find the fastest way out from every area on campus, as well as alternate routes in case some ways are blocked off or inaccessible. Look around campus after school or during lunch when you\u2019re allowed to be out and about.

Look around your classrooms and note thick tables that you might be able to turn over and crouch behind, or large cabinets you could hide behind. Avoid hiding behind objects made of plastic, like bathroom doors, or thin materials, like cabinet doors. If you do find yourself hiding in a classroom, stay on your hands and knees. Try not to let any vital organs touch the floor, like your heart or lungs, just in case the shooter comes in.

Take note of large objects you can use to block the door, like desks, tables, or movable cabinets. You can also wind and secure a belt around the door knob, then pull it tight to prevent the shooter from opening the door. Only do this if you or the teacher can stand to the side of the door to pull the belt taut. Practice moving tables against the door or holding the knob with a belt when you\u2019re at home, or also ask a teacher if you can practice in their classroom after class.

Take note of areas outside of the school as well. If you\u2019re in the hallways, you could shelter in a nearby classroom or janitorial closet. Avoid hiding in a restroom, as bathroom stalls provide very little protection don\u2019t typically have windows. If you\u2019re outside, try hiding behind a large tree, a concrete building or pillar, or a car. Hide near the front of the car, as the engine will stop bullets while the trunk will not."

Noticing things in your classroom that you can easily grab and throw will make you feel more prepared and safe in case of a shooting. Good objects to use to impede a shooter include heavy textbooks, fire extinguishers, and backpacks. If a shooter is entering your classroom, you can throw these objects at them to distract them and throw them off balance, giving you a window to escape."

Sign up for classes as your local gym or community center, looking in particular for courses that show you how to defend yourself against a shooter. Listen carefully in class and take the lessons seriously. Work hard to perfect your skills until they\u2019re second nature so that you feel safe and confident in case of a dangerous situation. Remember that you should only try to fight or disarm the shooter if you\u2019re an adult or older teenager, or if you truly have no other option, as you may be putting yourself in the line of fire."

Run means evacuate, hide means shelter, and fight means fight off the shooter as a last resort. No one option is considered best; it all depends on your situation. For example, if you don\u2019t have a safe escape route, you shouldn\u2019t try to evacuate. Instead, hide somewhere that the shooter can\u2019t see you.

To be prepared just in case this attack occurs, stay on alert during a drill and stay near your teacher and classmates. Don\u2019t chat too much with friends while you\u2019re walking out of the classroom. Remember that you need to be able to hear the teacher and what\u2019s happening around you, in case of emergency.

Ask them not to call you in this kind of situation, since you\u2019ll be staying quiet. Try texting instead. Think about a plan of action if you lose your phone during an emergency.

When you start to feel panicky, take deep breaths and focus on relaxing your muscles, even if it feels impossible. You can practice staying calm in situations like getting lost while driving or confronting someone who\u2019s angry or upset. Notice your body\u2019s physical reactions to stress.

Instead, resolve to be calm and resourceful if the situation ever strikes. Use your best instincts to get yourself out of danger.
