Working with a recycling company like AFPR for pick-up service is best, especially if you work for a business that receives massive amounts of EPS, or if you can collect a large volume of EPS, to make it easier to coordinate. Requesting a new pick-up spot is a lot easier if you can guarantee a large quantity. Most companies require storage containers to remain outdoors in a bin where EPS is kept clean, dry and unexposed to the elements. Check with AFPR to see whether stacking, bagging, or bundling loose Styrofoam will be appropriate for pick-up, then organize a regular pick-up on behalf of your company. EPS compactors are also available for use in some commercial spaces, to condense and make more portable a supply of EPS for pick-up. This can seriously cut down on the fuss of a large quantity of Styrofoam products in the meantime before it can be collected."
