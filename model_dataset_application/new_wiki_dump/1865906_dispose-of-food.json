          "description":"Composting foods that can be organically disposed of at home is a great way to reduce the amount of food you throw in the trash. It's good for the environment, and can give you some useful compost for the garden. Homemade compost will fertilize your soil and help with any gardening you do. Use food scraps such as fruits and vegetables, coffee grounds, eggshells, nutshells and tea bags. Do not dispose of meat, dairy or oils this way. Add the food waste to cardboard, newspaper, vegetation and other organic materials in your compost pile. Mix it in with soil and dirt so the food can be broken down. When you add new material to the pile, turn it with a garden fork or other tool to let fresh oxygen in to help with the composting process. If you don't have a yard, you can still compost at home with an earthworm farm."

Lots of recycling centres will have facilities to deal with food waste and composting. Generally you will be able to bring your food waste and either leave it with someone there, or dump it into the appropriate container. Be sure you check the specific guidelines for your centre before you go. You may need to separate your food waste in a particular way before you take in it. Make sure you know what food waste they accept and what they don't. For example, they will not take meat, but they will take organic waste, such as fruit and vegetables. Your local government will be able to provide details on recycling facilities near you."

It is becoming increasingly common for local authorities to provide a small food waste composting bin to households, which is then picked up alongside the regular trash collection. If you are uncertain about this, contact your local authority to find out if your neighbourhood is part of a scheme. Talk to neighbours to find out if they know about it, and how you can get involved. In these schemes you will often be provided with compostable bags to put your compostable food waste in."

Donating food to local charities, such as food banks and soup kitchens, is a great way to make sure nothing goes to waste. If you decide to do this, the first thing to do is determine what kind of food is suitable for you to donate. Generally non-perishable food, such as tinned vegetables, soups, fish and meat are all appropriate. Low-sugar cereal, tubs of peanut butter, raisins, and juice boxes are also very welcome. Avoid donating food in glass jars or containers. These may not be accepted because of the risk of them breaking. Remember you can also ask friends and family to see if they want anything too."

While you're at the food drive you could find out a little more about the work they do. Often they will be looking for new volunteers to help organise and distribute the donations.

If you do find some really old pasta or rice at the back of the cupboard you can just toss it in the trash. You may be tempted to feed stale bread to birds in your garden, but it has little nutritional value. Mouldy bread can even harm birds.
