Keep your cream refrigerated right up until the moment you plan to make your whipped cream. Chilling the equipment before making the whipped cream will make it easier to incorporate air into the cream. This will make the whipped cream lighter and fluffier. If you have a stand mixer, refrigerate the bowl and the whisk attachment. You can use a whisk to whip cream, but it will take vigorous whipping and a lot of extra time. Refrigerate the whisk if that\u2019s the tool you'll be working with."

Pour the cream into the chilled bowl, along with the vanilla, and the cinnamon or nutmeg if you like. To sweeten the whipped cream, add 2 tablespoons (16 g) of powdered sugar to the bowl as well."

Once the sugar and vanilla are incorporated into the cream, increase the speed to medium for about nine minutes, until stiff peaks begin to form. The stiff peak stage means that when you remove the whisk or beaters, the cream will hold its shape and won\u2019t melt back into the bowl as a liquid would. At the stiff peak stage, the whipped cream will have a slightly grainy texture."

To serve whipped cream, you can use a spoon to portion out dollops, or transfer the cream to a pastry bag and pipe it onto cakes and other baked goods. Store leftovers in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap for up to a day."

The chilling process also helps to separate the coconut cream from the water, which is important because you only need the cream for this recipe.
