          "description":"Use materials such as leaves, grass, straw, wood chips, sawdust, peat moss, or pine needles as a base for your organic mulch. Pick up these materials slowly and carefully to be sure that they are dry and free of bugs. Collect these materials in a closed plastic bin until you are ready to make the mulch. Be sure that no weeds get mixed into your compost materials. Collect materials on dry days and store them for future use. Do not use grass clippings if your lawn has been treated with weed-killing chemicals."

          "description":"To fully benefit from the nutrient-rich properties of your organic mulch, break or cut up all of your materials into the finest pieces possible. This will allow them to decompose more quickly. Use hedge trimmers, strong scissors, a sturdy shovel, or other tools to break up these materials. You can use larger pieces of organic materials for your mulch, but it will not start adding nutrients to your soil as quickly, nor will it look as tidy. Rent a wood chipper or shredder or make wood chips from broken trees limbs or other timber."

          "description":"It is important to remove weeds from your garden before applying mulch so that the mulch doesn't make them stronger. Use a garden fork to effectively dig out weeds from the root to ensure they don't grow back. If a weed is loosened effectively, you should be able to pull it out of the soil easily. Wear gloves to protect your hands."

Before laying down your biodegradable mulch, fertilize the soil to prepare for this loss. You can make your own nitrogen fertilizer or purchase one at a local garden center."

Be sure to leave at least 1 inch around the base of each plant that is untouched by the mulch. Plants may rot or develop a fungus if garden mulch suffocates their roots. Apply a layer of at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of biodegradable fertilizer to make sure that it is effective."

Gently rake away the old mulch from the surface of the soil and dispose of it. Replace it with a layer of fresh mulch. A build-up of old mulch can produce a hard film on your soil, making it difficult for water to penetrate to the roots of your plants."

Purchase black plastic mulch from a garden center or online to cover your soil during these cold-temperature periods. Layer plastic around your plants or cut holes in the sheeting to accommodate your plants. Use bricks to weigh down the sheeting, or purchase garden stakes from your local garden center."

This type of mulch can add a decorative flair to your garden, and it will not need to be replaced. You can also use pebbles and gravel for a finer version of this mulch."

          "description":"Rubber is an effective cover for your soil that will retain heat and prevent weeds. Place scraps of tire around your plants, leaving at least 1 inch around the base of your plants. Rubber is weather-resistant and will not need to be replaced frequently. If you don't have rubber scraps, get some from a scrap yard or recycling center. Rubber mulch will leave a strong rubber smell in your garden, which may dissuade some gardeners. Use as many pieces of rubber as needed to cover the soil in your garden bed."
