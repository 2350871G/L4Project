Hemp plants imported from overseas may have been grown with chemicals or pesticides that are illegal in the US. Also, make sure the CBD was manufactured and grown in the US. Some manufacturers import hemp plants from overseas and use them to produce CBD, meaning the product was technically made in the US. If you're not based in the US, check what chemicals or pesticides were used in growing the hemp plants. Look for products that are pesticide-free. The hemp plant can absorb chemicals like these from the soil. Ask the manufacturer for a certificate of analysis demonstrating the CBD levels in their product. If the manufacturer does not provide this without question, don\u2019t buy the product. If possible, buy CBD products from a pharmacy or health store instead of the internet. There is very little regulation on internet CBD products.Warning: Make sure the CBD product you get doesn\u2019t contain any THC, which is the chemical in marijuana that gets you high."

Doses of 25 mg or more are required to help you sleep. Start with this dose, and then slowly work your way up if this doesn\u2019t bring you relief. Since CBD in oil and edible form works slower, take the dosage 30-60 minutes before bed so your body has time to absorb it. Working your way to higher doses also helps your body get used to CBD if you\u2019ve never used it before. Also keep the cost in mind.
