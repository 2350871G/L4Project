Mix a small amount of mild dish soap with warm water until the mixture is sudsy. Dip a soft-bristled brush in the water. Scrub the vinyl seats until clean. This might best be accomplished outdoors. If you can take your vinyl seats outside, use a hose to rinse them off. This will both keep your floors clean and enable you to enjoy the washing and rinsing process in the open air. Alternately, you might want to clean your vinyl seats in your tub, if they fit. If you cannot easily take your vinyl seats outside, rinse them with a damp cloth."
