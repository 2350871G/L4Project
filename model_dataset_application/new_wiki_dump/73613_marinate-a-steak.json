          "description":"A basic marinade consists of an acidic liquid (which will break down muscle fibers), oil, and other flavorings, such as sweeteners, herbs, and/or spices. Marinades can be sweet and salty, Italian flavor, barbecue flavor - if you have a taste for it, chances are you can make it into a marinade. Choose a bottled marinade or mix your own using one of the ingredient lists in this article. Most marinades use one of the following acidic liquids as a tenderizer: wine, vinegar, or lemon juice. However, don't go overboard: while acidic marinades work by breaking down (denaturing) protein bonds, putting a steak in a highly acidic marinade (pH around 5 or lower) for more than two hours has the opposite effect, tightening the protein bonds, drawing out moisture, and making the meat tougher. There are also tenderizing enzymes in ginger, kiwi, papaya, and pineapple. It's possible to go overboard with these, too, turning the steak into mush. Dairy products like Greek yogurt and buttermilk can also have a tenderizing effect, although the way this works is not fully understood. Most likely, it\u2019s due to the lactic acid content."

Marinating a flat cut of meat in a large ziploc bag can be very useful since you will need less marinade to completely cover it here than you would inside a bowl. If you're running low on time, you can work in the marinade by massaging the meat. Otherwise, time will do the work."
