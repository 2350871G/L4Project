Pour in a few drops of anti-grease dish soap and mix it in so that the water suds up. The grease-cutting dish soap is designed to tackle hard to clean stains like the ones famously acquired by silicone bakeware. Make sure you use very hot water.

Leave the bakeware in the sink for at least thirty minutes, though you may need to leave it for a bit longer (one hour) for really tough stains. While your preference might be to use a more natural dish soap, those ingredients won\u2019t be nearly as effective for the tough stains you\u2019ll find on your silicone bakeware."

Try using the grease-cutting dish soap again and scrubbing it over and over. Try to use even hotter water the second time. If you use rubber gloves, you\u2019ll be able to use hotter water while cleaning your silicone bakeware."

Once the oven is fully preheated, put the silicone bakeware into the oven for ten minutes. This will help heat up the food stains that are stuck on the bakeware and make them easier to clean. After you\u2019ve heated up the bakeware, try washing it with grease-cutting dish soap and baking soda. Be careful not to burn yourself while handling the bakeware when you remove it from the oven."
