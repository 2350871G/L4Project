          "description":"If you want a simple, traditional yard, stick with grass, simple shrubs, and basic bushes. Stick with 1-2 varieties of flower, or skip them altogether. Choose this option if you want to minimize the amount of effort you need to put into maintenance or don\u2019t want to stand out on your block. This is also a great option if your current yard has nothing in it. You can always build on a basic yard later as you save money for renovation costs or develop new ideas for your yard. Keeping your yard relatively simple is a great idea if you have children or pets, since you won\u2019t need to worry as much about anyone stomping on precious plants or fragile structures."

          "description":"If you want to feel like you\u2019re entering a greenhouse when you\u2019re walking up to your front door, reserve lots of space in your yard for various plants, flowers, and shrubs. Cover mailboxes or light fixtures with vines and use garden gates to make it seem like your yard is a brand new world. Keep in mind, you\u2019ll need to put a lot more effort into your yard if you plant a ton of greenery. This may not be the best option if you live in an area prone to droughts. If you don\u2019t have a steady supply of water, your yard will naturally degrade into compost over time."

If your home is a ranch-style building with a single floor, plant dwarf shrubs and bushes to complement the shape and style of the architecture. Utilizing structures and plants that match the architectural style of your home will ensure that nothing looks out of place or seems off. You can break this guideline if you want to emphasize the yard over your home by planting larger, more unique plants. If you want to emphasize your home over the yard, keep the landscape simple and streamlined."

You can hire a contractor to install a pattern of stones or load your front yard with gravel. This is also a great choice if you don\u2019t want to worry about maintaining plants or live somewhere with extreme shifts in temperature that tend to destroy a lot plants. This is a great option if you live in a city and don\u2019t have an enclosed yard, since you won\u2019t need to worry about strangers trampling all over your greenery. Skipping plants is also a great choice if you live in an arid climate that doesn\u2019t get much rain."

Keep wild plants and furniture 3\u20135 feet (0.91\u20131.52 m) away from the sides of your door to avoid blocking it. Restricting the door will make it hard for people to identify the focal point of your yard.Tip: When looking at a building, most people naturally look at the door before inspecting any other elements in your yard.

          "description":"A garden gate is a doorframe or overhang that separates your front yard from your backyard. If your front yard is enclosed, put a garden gate in front of your front door to create a beautiful symmetry for your front yard. If the front yard is open, place a garden gate on the same horizontal plane as your front door on one of the sides of your building. A garden gate leading into your front door is a great way to make your front yard feel like a distinct, separate space. A garden gate on the side of your home will function as a clear divider for guests and bystanders. This will create a heightened sense of privacy. You do not need to include a garden gate if you don\u2019t want to."

Consider how many people you live with and how often you have guests over to determine how much seating you need. Set up benches, rocking chairs, and outdoor furniture in shady areas of your yard to stay cool on hot summer days. Avoid setting up seating that isn\u2019t capable of being locked up if you live in a city. A simple chain lock will work to deter opportunistic thieves in most cases. While umbrellas are great for creating shade in a backyard, they tend to take up a ton of space in a front yard. Avoid using one unless you have no nearby trees or overhangs."

Use smaller flowers or bushes to line the area where the yard meets the structure. Wildflowers, orchids, and cacti can all work well as border plants to create some texture between the porch, fence, and yard. Leave at least 6 inches (15 cm) of space between the bases of fences and porches and the flowers you line them with. If you\u2019re going for a more modern look or your fence and porch are unique, consider lining the surrounding space with gravel or loose stones instead. For a more natural look, plant vines or ivies along the porch or fence. As they grow, they will make their way up the fence and porch to give it a rustic look.."

Boxwood, inkberry, and holly are all excellent choices for the area near your foundation since they require little work when it comes to maintenance. Foundation plants should be placed at least 4\u20136 feet (1.2\u20131.8 m) away from the building to ensure that the roots don\u2019t grow into your foundation.

Japanese barberry is a great choice if you want a shorter bush that grows in wild directions. Korean boxwood is a great choice if you prefer small-leaved shrubs that can be cut into unique geometric shapes. Most evergreen and deciduous bushes grow in a variety of climates. Evergreen varieties are particularly good for colder climates."

Deadnettle is a solid choice for a flower that functions as ground cover since it\u2019s quite resilient and sticks around for a longer period of time.

You can measure the dimensions of your yard and use graph paper to create a scale drawing, but this isn\u2019t necessary for preliminary sketches. This process is more about choosing locations and shapes than placing structures and plants in specific locations.Tip: Design companies typically perform this service for you, but you should sketch your desired layout even if you aren\u2019t doing the work yourself. It will be helpful to refer to your illustration when you\u2019re trying to explain what you want to the contractors. Do this on a sheet of paper larger than 9 by 11 inches (23 by 28 cm) to give yourself plenty of room to work. Keep it smaller than 36 by 42 inches (91 by 107 cm) though, since too much space will make it hard to keep your drawing consistent."

          "description":"Get a roll of tracing paper and cut out a sheet as large as your original outline to give yourself enough room to work. Cut a few sheets to size and sketch different possible layouts for your landscaping features. Play around with symmetrical and asymmetrical designs. Draw where you want to place your shrubs, bushes, and flowers. If your walkways don\u2019t exist yet, sketch out where you want to put them. You don\u2019t need to know exactly what type of plant you\u2019re going to put in each space, but it\u2019s a good idea to have a sense for the type of look you\u2019re going for. Label each shape that you draw so that you can easily keep track of what everything is going to look like. For example, you may draw larger rectangles and label them \u201cshrubs\u201d followed by smaller circles that are labeled \u201cflowers.\u201d\nUnless your yard is oddly shaped, it\u2019s best to keep walkways simple. Going straight from the sidewalk to your door will minimize the amount of space that your walkway takes up while making it easier to navigate at night. It\u2019s a good idea to leave at least 50% of your yard empty. A little negative space is important and you may want room to exercise or walk around."

Once you\u2019ve selected a layout, lay your chosen design out over the outline of the yard and put a new sheet of tracing paper on top. Re-sketch your layout and pay more attention to the lines that you draw to give each feature a more defined shape. Add individual stones, walkways and textures to give your drawing a greater sense of detail. You may realize as you\u2019re adding more details that your design is too busy, empty, or that something is improperly placed. For example, draw squiggly lines around your shrubs to give them some texture, draw small flowers together to get a sense for the texture of your garden. Add individual stones or concrete squares to give your walkway its shape."

Use a brown or black to color in planter boxes or designated areas for soil. Use gray or beige for your walkways and driveway. This will make it easier to visualize where everything belongs when it comes time to put your sketch into practice. Again, your sketch doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. Things can change as you go about discussing options with landscaping contractors or consultants. If you\u2019re doing your own landscaping, you may deviate from your outline once you realize that certain things need to be changed."

Label each shape that you draw so that you can easily keep track of what everything is going to look like. For example, you may draw larger rectangles and label them \u201cshrubs\u201d followed by smaller circles that are labeled \u201cflowers.\u201d\nUnless your yard is oddly shaped, it\u2019s best to keep walkways simple. Going straight from the sidewalk to your door will minimize the amount of space that your walkway takes up while making it easier to navigate at night. It\u2019s a good idea to leave at least 50% of your yard empty. A little negative space is important and you may want room to exercise or walk around. Select your favorite design and redraw the design with more detail. Set each of your possible layouts out next to one another to get a better sense of what you like. Once you\u2019ve selected a layout, lay your chosen design out over the outline of the yard and put a new sheet of tracing paper on top. Re-sketch your layout and pay more attention to the lines that you draw to give each feature a more defined shape. Add individual stones, walkways and textures to give your drawing a greater sense of detail. You may realize as you\u2019re adding more details that your design is too busy, empty, or that something is improperly placed. For example, draw squiggly lines around your shrubs to give them some texture, draw small flowers together to get a sense for the texture of your garden. Add individual stones or concrete squares to give your walkway its shape. Color in your drawing to get a sense for the visual impact of your design. Use a green pencil or marker to shade in grass and use a darker green for shrubs and bushes. Select colors for your flowers based on the colors that you plan on planting. Use a brown or black to color in planter boxes or designated areas for soil. Use gray or beige for your walkways and driveway. This will make it easier to visualize where everything belongs when it comes time to put your sketch into practice. Again, your sketch doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. Things can change as you go about discussing options with landscaping contractors or consultants. If you\u2019re doing your own landscaping, you may deviate from your outline once you realize that certain things need to be changed.",
