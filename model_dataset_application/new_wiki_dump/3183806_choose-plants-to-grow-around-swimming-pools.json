          "description":"It's hard enough cleaning a pool regularly without increasing the chances of clogging the filter and ending up with messy pool water filled with plant material. To help keep shedding to a minimum, choose plants that are lush and evergreen, won't drop leaves (or only drop leaves and flower that are large and easy to retrieve), won't drop needles, seeds, thorns or prickles, etc. If the plants you want to put around the pool do tend to drop bark, leaves, flowers, etc., try to do a regular sweep around the pool and fish out plant material from the pool at least weekly. Plants with thorns, prickles or other painful things might be trodden on around the pool area, so try to avoid such plants. Avoid spiky leaves wherever people walk by. Fruit can be messy when it falls and gets squashed, so take care when choosing a tree or vine that produces fruits. For example, avoid planting cherry and plum trees near the pool. If you have flowering plants poolside, a regular sweep up of their dropped blooms is recommended because not only might they be messy but pollen can stain the paving surface around the pool. Avoid putting plants like wattle (acacia), bottlebrush, azaleas and bougainvillea too close to a pool because they shed tiny petals that are hard to clean."

          "description":"The body of water in your pool will serve as large heat reflective surface that can scorch plants in close vicinity. This means that the plants you choose must be able to withstand hotter temperatures and sun glare. The plants also need to cope with being splashed frequently when pool-goers are swimming and splashing about. A small succulent or cacti garden near the pool can be nice for warmer climate zones. Just make sure that the cacti aren't likely to present a hazard to anyone walking or running around the pool\u2013\u2013to prevent the possibility of a prickly fall, place a guard rail or perspex fence in front of cacti displays. Good succulents include Aeonium, Cotyledon, Crassula, Dudleya, Kalanchoe, Sempervivum and Senecio. Ferns, palms (e.g. pygmy date palms, bamboo palms) and large leaved bushes can make an ideal poolside garden environment as they provide shade and help cool the poolside environment. Small palms won't send roots into the pool. Ornamental grasses like bamboo, lemon grass, fountain grass, feather grass, giant reeds and zebra grass are good poolside choices. However, be careful of grasses that have sharp blades, spread seeds or flowers and shed easily. Tropical plants are another good heat resistant choice. Examples include bird of paradise, hibiscus, canna and palm trees."

Choose plants that don't require a lot of effort in terms of watering, pruning and ongoing care. Good choices that can lower maintenance include palms, impatiens, ginger family plants, begonias, garden/ornamental grasses, zebra plant, canna lily and frangipani. Where possible, use local varieties of plants that can cope with your climate and soils, as this will also reduce maintenance."

Bear in mind the possibility of attracting bees and other insects not wanted near the pool are though. For example, honeysuckle, jasmine, passionflower, trumpet vine and lavender are nice choices that smell great and tolerate heat, and will create a variety of color poolside. Flowers that release their fragrance at night during the summer months can make an excellent choice for those who enjoy evening swims after the sun's heat has started to wane. Vine plants will need trellises or other supports (see the next Part for more details). If family members or visitors have bee allergies, restrict flowering plants to other parts of the garden, as the combination of water and flowers can attract bees and increase the risk of being stung."
