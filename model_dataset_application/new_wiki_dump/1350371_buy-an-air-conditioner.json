Different air conditioners have different cooling capacities, so you\u2019ll need this information to select one that has the correct cooling capacity for the size of the space you want to cool. If there\u2019s no wall or door separating the space you want to cool from an adjoining room, add the area of the adjoining room to your calculation because the air conditioner will have to cool that space as well."

          "description":"The cooling capacities of all air conditioners are measured in BTUs (British thermal units) per hour. By looking at a unit\u2019s BTUs, you can know the area it is capable of adequately cooling. The higher a unit\u2019s BTU, the larger the area it can cool. The label or online description of a specific air conditioner will typically state what area the unit is capable of cooling. An air conditioner with a cooling capacity of 5,000 BTUs, for example, can cool rooms that are between 100\u2013150 square feet (9.3\u201313.9 m) in area. You\u2019ll need an air conditioner with a cooling capacity of 6,000 BTUs to cool a room that\u2019s 150\u2013250 square feet (14\u201323 m) in area.

Go with a unit with 10 percent higher capacity if your room receives a lot of direct sunlight. Buy a unit with 10 percent less capacity if the room you\u2019ll be cooling is heavily shaded. Add another 4,000 BTU if you\u2019ll be using the air conditioner to cool your kitchen. If more than 2 people will be regularly spending time in the room, increase the capacity of the air conditioner you buy by 600 BTUs per person."

          "description":"Window air conditioners sit on your window, and are supported by a mounting bracket that you screw into your window sill. They have cooling capacities that range from 5,000 to 12,500 BTUs, and are capable of cooling rooms that are 100\u2013650 square feet (9.3\u201360.4 m) in area. Smaller units typically cost somewhere between $150 - $250, while larger units with higher cooling capacities can cost as much as $600. Install window air conditioners in your window or in a designated space designed for a window air conditioner in your wall. Measure your window before selecting a window air conditioner. Window A/C units come in a variety of sizes. Measure the height and the width of your window and make sure these dimensions are slightly larger than the A/C unit you purchase. The height, width, and depth of an A/C unit will be printed on its box."

Their cooling capacities range from 9,000 BTUs to 15,500 BTUs. These units use more energy than comparably sized window units and aren\u2019t as efficient at cooling. They are more convenient, however, because they are portable. Portable air conditioners are typically more expensive than window units, ranging in price from $300 - $700. Portable units also tend to be noisier than window units. You\u2019ll need to place the portable unit near a window so that it can vent hot air through its hose to the outside."

Split ductless units are more expensive than window or portable units, typically costing at least $1,000. This type of air conditioning is known as a \u201csplit\u201d system because it is split between an inside unit and an outside unit. It is called \u201cductless\u201d because it does not require the installation of any air ducts in your home. Instead, a small hose runs through your wall and connects the inside unit to the outside one. The inside unit is typically mounted high up on a wall near the ceiling and looks like a thin, long white box. Split ductless units are difficult to install, so you may want to call a professional to handle the installation."
