This will help remove any crusted food or grease from the burner elements, and also make it easier to clean the stove around your burners. When you\u2019re done cleaning your stove, scrub the burner elements with a scouring pad and rinse them off before putting them back on the stove. If your burners aren\u2019t removable or have electric components, don\u2019t soak them. Instead, lay a warm, wet cloth over the coils, being careful not to get the electric parts wet, and wipe them down with a paper towel instead of rinsing them."
