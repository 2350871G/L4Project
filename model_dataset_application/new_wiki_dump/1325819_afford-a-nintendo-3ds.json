If you look around, there will be some great deals. Checking your local Craigslist under \"Video Games\" is a good idea. Ask your friends. If they have a 3DS but bought a 3DS XL or simply don't want it anymore, you could ask them if they can sell you their old 3DS. If you got an iPhone, download the Red Laser app, and scan the 3DS's barcode, to bring up a list of deals and offers."
