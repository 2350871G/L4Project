You can find this kind of yarn in almost any color and it comes in a variety of materials, such as acrylic, wool, alpaca, cashmere, and bamboo. To figure out if a yarn is medium worsted weight, check the label on the yarn. It should describe the weight with a term like medium, bulky, or super bulky."

          "description":"If you want to finish a project faster, or you just like the bulky look, then opt for a bulky or extra bulky yarn. These yarns are popular as well, so you will have lots of different colors to choose from. Most often, bulky yarns are acrylic, but you may be able to find them in other materials if you go to a craft or specialty yarn store."

          "headline":"Try cotton yarn for washcloths.",
          "description":"Cotton yarn does not give the way that other types of yarn do, so it is not usually a good type of yarn for hats and other garments that need some stretch to them. However, cotton yarn is excellent for making washcloths and hand towels. If you feel like making a washcloth, try picking up a ball of cotton yarn."

You can even find sets of three or more pairs of metallic needles if you want to buy in bulk. Metallic needles can make it easier to knit faster, but plastic needles are lighter in weight. Try starting with a standard size 8 needle. This is a common size for patterns that use medium worsted weight yarn."

          "description":"Bamboo and wood needles are incredibly popular among knitters. They are often easier to grip and some knitters prefer the texture of wood or bamboo to plastic or metal. If you are new to knitting, or if you have never tried using bamboo or plastic needles, give them a try. You can get bamboo needles in all sizes."

However, some people also like to knit on circular needles when doing a big project like a blanket because it is easier to fit all the stitches. You can also use double ended needles for small scale knitting in the round, such as for making mittens or a hat for a baby."

Browse through some patterns online or in a pattern book to find a project that you want to make. A pattern is also a helpful guide for the supplies you will need to complete a project.

These are especially useful when you are knitting on double ended needles, but you can place them on the ends of any type of needle when you are ready to put it away for the day."
