          "description":"The door of the pooja room must be distinguishable from the other doors in the house. You can choose a wooden door, with perhaps religious carvings in the wood, or perhaps a glass, clear door that displays the room even when closed. If you want to add or change the door to your room, you can browse available designs at your neighborhood hardware and construction store, and then read our tips on how to fit and install the doors in your home."

          "description":"You can add decorations to either side of the doors and to the threshold to further highlight the beauty of the room and make it more inviting. You can place a bronze or crystal vase of flowers on either side of the door (on the inside or outside), pin a flower garland over the top of the door frame, or pin firefly string lights up there. Lotus flowers, which are associated with purity and beauty in Hinduism and Buddhism, would look good in vases, especially as they are often light-colored in keeping with the rest of the decor. Marigolds make a beautiful garland because of their size and bright, warm orange color. They often signify the sun, and are in keeping with the general hopeful, welcoming atmosphere of the pooja room."

You can add a low, wooden stool with a cushion on top, or you can add several round or square cushions that will be comfortable to sit on. You can buy these at any department, general merchandise or furniture stores."

          "headline":"Add lighting so the room is never dark.",
          "description":"A pooja room must never be kept dark, so you should have a small lamp or candle in the room, on the mandap, for when the sun goes down. You can also, of course, use various kinds of lighting to enhance the serene atmosphere of the room during the daytime. If you would like to add candles, copper, bronze, crystal or glass vessels are appropriate and the lit candles should always be in front of the idol(s). Installing a chandelier, or other overhead lighting, is a good way to save space while lighting up the entire room in a beautiful way. You could also add \u201cfirefly\u201d string lights, many of which are copper and would fit the auspiciousness of the room, and which have a low wattage and therefore a gentle glow. These only require AA or AAA batteries to work. Placing brass lamps on either side of the mandap helps accentuate that space as the highlight of the room."

You can hang flower garlands above or around door and window frames, or across the mandap, and you can also place loose bunches of flowers, or petals, across the mandap to enhance the beauty of that sacred spot."

          "description":"You can create a rangoli, which is a pattern made out of flower petals, dry rice, and colored flour or sand often made on the floor for decoration and good luck. They are often in simple geometric shapes, or in the shape of a flower or petal, and as large as you would like them to be. The base material is usually dry or wet powdered rice or dry flour, to which you can add vermillion, turmeric and other natural colors to create a multi-colored pattern. You can add flower petals on top and around the flour to accentuate the multi-colored pattern and add an eye-catching element. You can also add tea lights, or small candles, around the pattern. If you wish to avoid fire risks, you can buy battery-operated tea lights. If you don\u2019t have space or just prefer not to place the rangoli on the floor, you can fill a bowl--ideally a semi-shallow, wide and flat bowl--with water and place flower petals inside to create a floating pattern. You can place this on the mandap or any other surfaces in the room."

          "description":"It\u2019s easy to add a beautiful effect to simple home spaces by using sheets of lace, doilies, or lace stencils. You can buy lace and stencils at your local fabric and craft store. You can use a lace stencil, or spread a thin lace sheet, over any surfaces. Wrap small lace sheets around glass tea lights, and sew small stitches to hold them together, instantly creating beautiful candle vessels for a low price. Hanging lace curtains over the windows, or painting a lace pattern with a stencil onto the window will look beautiful and serene and soften the light that comes through the window."

You can find a mirror with a detailed, bronze frame and hang it or lean it against the wall, both of which help the room feel a little bit bigger than it is. If you have a window, placing a mirror on the opposite wall will help enhance the natural light that comes in."

The best kind to use will be one that has an open area, or shelves, on the top half, and drawers on the bottom half. Every mandap must have space to feature the religious figures and imagery. If you have the money in your budget, you can order custom-made mandaps and choose your preferred color and materials. Wood or marble are popular choices, depending on the style of your room. You can refurbish old cabinets by fixing or removing drawers or cabinets by using a screwdriver or other basic home tools. You can also use sandpaper to smooth the cabinet, and paint it with wood stain or a new coat of paint (in white, light yellow, orange, or blue!) Having drawers on your altar is useful for having a space to keep incense, lighters, turmeric, thali plates and other small items used during worship in the pooja room. The open space and shelves will house idols and images."

Bronze and copper items are considered appropriate for a pooja room; as are clay idols and items made of crystal or glass. A white Ganesha (an ancient Indian deity) idol is believed to attract more wealth, happiness and prosperity. A Ganesha idol made of mango, peepal or neem trees attract good luck and positive energy. Crystal statues are believed to remove negative energy flows and immediately change your life."

Idols should be at least one inch apart from each other, and should not face each other. Idols--and the rest of your pooja room--should never face south. Keep the idols in the east and/or west of the prayer room, a few inches from the wall, and make sure they\u2019re always in perfect condition, clean and well cared-for."
