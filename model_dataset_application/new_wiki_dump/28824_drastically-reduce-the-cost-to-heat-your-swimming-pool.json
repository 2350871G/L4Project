This can easily be prevented by using a pool cover whenever the pool is not in use, which will minimize evaporation. It\u2019s the most effective way to reduce pool heating costs \u2013 it can reduce cost by as much as 50 to 70 percent. There are several pool cover options available on the market, including manual, semi-automatic, and automatic pool covers. These come in a wide range of prices and many of them have added features that help to conserve even more energy. Even throwing a large tarp or piece of plastic over the pool technically counts as a pool cover and it will certainly help. However, it\u2019s far more effective to use a cover that\u2019s specifically made for pools."

          "description":"Run the pool heater according to how often the pool is used. Always turn it down when it isn\u2019t being used. Gas burning pool heaters, in particular, can warm swimming pool water relatively quickly. Depending on how often you use pool, it may be more efficient to only run the heater when needed. For example, if you only swim on Saturday and Sunday, it\u2019s not necessary to run your pool heater all week long. Turn your gas pool heater on Friday night, and depending on the size of the heater, you will have nice warm water by Saturday morning. Turn the heater off again Sunday evening for a drastic reduction in gas costs."

Keep the water temperature in the correct range when it\u2019s being used \u2013 78-80 degrees for active swimming and 82-84 degrees for recreational use.

A pool heat pump uses warmth drawn from the outside air to heat the pool water. You need access to electricity to power the heat pump. Pool heat pumps cost more than gas heaters, but because of their high efficiencies, the yearly operating cost ends up being less than a gas heater. Pool heat pumps tend to last longer that gas heaters, as well, as long as proper maintenance is observed."

As it insulates the surface of the pool, solar blankets also allow some of the sun's energy to go through the cover and into the water, where it turns into heat. This makes your pool water warmer, which means the swimming pool heater is required to run far less often and for shorter periods of time. Solar pool covers are one of the most effective and energy efficient ways to heat your pool. Solar pool covers can extend your swimming season and reduce the amount of water that needs to be added by 30 to 50 percent. They can also reduce the amount of chemicals a pool needs by 35 to 60 percent, and help keep dirt and debris out of the pool, which reduces cleaning time."

The only drawback is that if the sun doesn't shine, your pool isn't heated. Solar pool heating panels are an excellent solution for those who live in warmer climates and have a lot of sunny days throughout the year."

Solar heating systems have minimal operating costs and they are the most cost-efficient choice for people who live in warm, sunny climates. These systems include 4 main features \u2013 a solar collector, a filter, a pump and a flow control valve. The pump sends water through the filter and then through the solar collector, which heats the water and returns it back to the pool. If you live in a hot climate, the solar collector can help you cool your pool water down during the summer months. It does this by running the water through the solar collector during the night."

The speed can be regulated, which means you can turn the pump down on most days and only run it at higher speeds when you need a thorough cleaning. Additionally, high efficiency pumps are able to circulate pool water better than traditional pumps. This will save you even more money, since well circulated water causes less daily stress on the filter."

In a recent study, pool owners in Florida decreased their pumping to less than 3 hours each day. After doing so, the majority of them reported that they were still satisfied with the quality of their pool\u2019s water. By doing this, the pool owners saved an average of 60 percent on their utility bills."

Set your pump to run several short cycles throughout the day rather than running for long stretches of time. Your pool will actually be cleaner by doing this, especially if you deal with a lot of debris. The shorter, more frequent cycles allow debris to be filtered out of the pool faster because it prevents it from building up. It also puts less stress on the filter itself."
