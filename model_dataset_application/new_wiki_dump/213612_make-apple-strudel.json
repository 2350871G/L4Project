  "text":" Make the Dough Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl and form a well in the center.  Add the egg and oil to the flour and mix well; you can either mix with your hands or an electric mixer.  Add the water to the bowl, while stirring continuously; keep mixing until soft dough is formed.  Turn the dough, which will be sticky at this point, onto a lightly floured pastry board.  Hold the dough 20 inches (50.8 cm) above the board and slam it on the board about 100-120 times. As you progress, the dough should become smooth and stretchy. Knead the dough and shape into a disc. Brush the top of dough with some oil. Place the dough in a bowl and cover with a damp towel, then leave it to rest for 30 minutes as you prepare the filling.  Make the Filling Core and pare the apples. Cut the apples into slices about 1/8 in. thick and put in a bowl with Vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar; toss lightly to coat. Set aside for half an hour. Mix the white sugar, cinnamon, Allspice and the remaining brown sugar together in a bowl; put this mixture to one side.  Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet and toss dry bread crumbs in the butter, until they are coated properly.  Stretch the Dough Cover a table (around 48 in. by 30 in.) with a clean cloth, letting the edges hang off. Sprinkle the cloth with about \u00bd-1 cup of flour, keeping the majority of it in the center.  Place the dough in the center of the cloth and shape into a square (if needed, sprinkle more flour under the dough so it doesn't stick).  Brush off any flour left on top of the dough, and brush the top with some cooking oil.  Reach under dough to it's center (the dough should rest on backs of hands) and lift slightly, being very careful not to tear the dough. Gently pull arms in opposite directions, and lower dough to table as you walk around table, pulling each side evenly (do not pull too much in one area). Keep stretching dough until it is as thin as tissue paper. Cut off the thick outer edges of dough with some clean scissors, and allow the stretched dough to dry for no more than 10 minutes.  Roll and Bake the Strudel Brush the dough with \u00bc cup of the melted butter.  Sprinkle the buttery bread crumbs in the center of the dough, making sure to keep the sides free so they can be folded over the filling.  Place the seasoned apple slices over the crumbs, and then sprinkle the lemon peel over apples.  Spread the chopped nuts and raisins evenly across the dough. Sprinkle the spiced sugar mixture over the fruit and nuts, and then drizzle the filling with \u00bd cup of melted butter. Fold the dough on three sides so it covers the filling.  Roll the dough over filling, starting at the narrow end; the strudel should now look like a large jelly role.  Cut the Strudel in half, and gently roll both halves onto a baking sheet.  Brush the excess flour off of each roll, then pinch the ends of each strudel together, so the filling won't ooze out while it's baking. Brush the top and sides with melted butter. Bake in the oven at 350\u00b0 for 30-45 minutes, or until golden brown. Baste and brush about 4 times during baking with melted butter. Place the strudel onto a cooling rack. Once cool, cut in two-inch slices and serve warm.",
