      "description":"Almost any animal's paws, feet, or tails can be used whether it be a small creature such as a squirrel, or a larger animal such as a deer. Specimens can be collected from various sources. One primary collection method is simply to hunt the prey, but if you don't want to take the time to stalk, shoot, and clean the animal road kill can provide excellent samples. Keep in mind some US states require the purchase of a trapping license to retrieve road kill."

For most small crafts such as key chains, necklaces, and antenna toppers you might consider covering the cut end of the specimen with a hardening polymer such as liquid steel and then sanding it once it is dry, drilling a hole through the polymer and the bone, and ultimately inserting a key ring, leather strap, etc."
