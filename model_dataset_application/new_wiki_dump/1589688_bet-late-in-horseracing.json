With a wide angle binoculars, you can spot a horse's number quickly. With powerful binoculars, you could see the horse just as if you were a few yards away, which is very desirable because you'll get a better sense of the horse's behavior pre-race."

Depending on the length and ease of getting into the line, you'll need to be ready to dash to the betting window before the race starts. It is also recommended that you situate yourself so that you can see the horses as they go around the track to the starting gate.

Research the horses before going to the track. Factor in the track conditions and the weather. Compare the odds vs the payout. Study all parts of horse racing. We make mistakes because we are human\u2013\u2013but this also applies to horses and results can be spotty, so studying the horses intently and at the latest possible opportunity will give you great insight as to what will happen a few minutes into the future."

Be aware of your initial reactions and thought processes after viewing them. After each race, you will notice that the horses that stood out before the race were the ones that finished well. Horses are living, breathing creatures much like humans, and they have their ups and downs and unexpected occurrences. Their condition just prior to a race is up-to-date and if you take the time to observe them, you'll be able to use your senses to help interpret this condition for each horse viewed."

What is the inclination of that horse for the present moment? Football and boxing are dangerous sports but horse racing is multiple times more dangerous for jockeys. It is safer for a horse to be in the rear, so use your sense to see whether the horse you're observing can overcome that fear and go to gun for the lead and be ahead of the pack."

Consider: bone structure, muscle size, height, weight, type of runner in relation to the pack, sweating, awareness, are the muscles pumped up, etc. Consider the disposition of the horses you'd like to bet on. Apply the lessons you've learned from life apart from horse racing, looking for things that are similar. For example, can you put out maximal effort without warming-up? How does the horse look, is he cold, warm or too hot? And so forth."

These are the horses that look like a child throwing a tantrum in public that the parents can't control. Look for inability to calm, snorting, kicking, stomping on the ground, etc. Eliminate any horse that is complacent and docile. Differentiate between: 1) a complacent horse and 2) a horse that is controlled yet not moving but ready to run. You must concentrate and focus in on horses that are not moving, yet have potential."
