Take notes on what you do and don\u2019t like, and about any aspect of the pieces that you want to include in your design. Make sure that you try out the pieces that you like if possible. Sit in chairs that you like, and imagine how particular tables or cabinets would look in your own home. Often many of the modern furniture pieces that you like will be a compromise. For example, you may love how a dining chair looks, but find it uncomfortable to sit in. Or you may love the shape and structure of a desk, but not like the type of wood that has been used. Keep a record of all of these things, so that you can design your piece to be a perfect balance between your preferences for functionality and aesthetic."
