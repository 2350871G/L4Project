Roses tend to do best with up to 90 inches (229 cm) of water a year, but they don't like being constantly wet. A good drenching in the summer months 1-2 times a week should be perfect. Consider getting a soaker hose, which slowly lets water into the soil to drench down to the deepest roots. Make sure to water the roots and soil, not the leaves. Wet leaves and blooms promote bush-killing fungus."

A 2-4 inch (5-10 cm) layer of garden shavings, or professional mulch, will be perfect. Leave a small space, about an inch (2.5 cm), between the mulch and the base of the roses."

Always water the plants before adding fertilizer -- this plumps them up and prevents stress. Adding fresh compost to the roses can eliminate the need for fertilizer. Otherwise, consider adding it once a month if you feel your soil isn't very nutritious. Add a tablespoon of Epsom salts to the fertilizer in early June to promote new growth. You can over-fertilize, harming the plants. Follow the directions on the bottle for the best results."

Using sharp shears, make a 45\u00b0 cut above this bud or set of leaves, leaving the but completely on the stalk. This will promote growth to this new bud while chopping all the \"dead weight\" above it. Outside bud means one facing away from the center of the plant. This promotes outward and upward growth, which prevents \"clogging\" the center of the plant. Cutting at an angle, rather than straight across, allows water to run off the pruned branch rather than pooling on the cut and causing rot or fungal infections."

Flowers cost the bush a lot of energy, and deadheading allows it to save this energy to make new blooms. Stop deadheading in the fall, a few weeks before frosts are forecasted, to avoid letting new shoots freeze to death. Deadheading usually starts in the early spring, with the first sets of blooms, but continues throughout the blooming season. It encourages repeat flowering. Your goal is to let the stem, or \"cane,\" keep developing with more leaves and flowers. Don't cut it right where it meets the bush."

          "description":"Dead canes are easy to spot -- they're all brown, thin, and haven't produced any buds or new leaves. Cut 2-3 inches below the dead spots to stop the spread. Spotted or mottled branches, which may be diseased, should go, too. You can trim these away throughout the season, but you definitely want to get rid of them in the beginning of winter. Any branch thinner than a pencil's diameter should be cut away right before the bad frosts -- they won't make it through anyway. Roses need good airflow to stay healthy, and too many leaves and branches crowding the center of the plant can lead to mold issues."

If you prune on the edges, the plant will grow up. This is why a rounded rose bush is often the easiest way to prune roses, as all sides will grow more or less equally. But there are specific instances where this might not be desirable:\nClimbers should be tied straight up, with dead growth snipped away. Keep deadheading the tops and keep tying up new major canes to promote climbing. Groundcover roses shouldn't be snipped at the ends. Instead, follow the cane back to the source and cut it as low down as possible. Cutting the ends promotes upward, uneven shoots. Multiple roses planted together can be treated as one plant, and cut into a hedge or large single shrub."

          "description":"Roses have the remarkable ability to sprout new buds out of even the oldest branches, meaning you can really hack away at it and still keep the plant alive, though a little bit slow for a year or two of blooming. This doesn't give you carte blanch to start snipping everywhere, but it should remind you to be confident and follow your gut as you cut. You won't \u201cruin\u201d anything permanently if you prune your shrub a little too much."

          "description":"If your roses only bloom once a year, you cannot prune them using the same methods used for continuous-bloom roses. Once-bloom roses are usually old, mature plants that bloom around mid-July. Once the roses bloom and the petals start to fade and fall, prune the bush to your desired shape and cut away any dead growth. You can take off about 15 inches (38 cm) of growth every other year with once-bloom roses."

When watering, aim low and soak the soil, avoiding the leaves. They will get wet sometimes, most noticeably when it rains, but this is okay. The point is not to keep the leaves completely dry, just not to get them wet if you don't need to."

          "description":"If you're going to collect cut flowers from your roses, don't spray them down with chemicals. However, if the shrubs are purely decorative, a fungus spray is often a good idea to keep them clean and beautiful. You can also get \"dormant sprays\" that will work throughout the winter -- a good choice right before you pack the plants up for the cold. Anti-fungals are especially important during cool, wet periods of weather. If you see black spots on the leaves or a light gray, powdery, fuzzy mold anywhere, spray an anti-fungal immediately. Good air flow and full sunlight are the most effective antifungals, so be wary when these conditions disappear due to the weather."

As soon as you see one, examine and clean the whole plant before they attract more. Luckily, they are easy to spot and deal with, especially if you catch the infestation early. However, for serious cases where plucking by hand is impossible, an insecticide with carbaryl, permethrin, or neem in it should do the trick. Organic pesticides (with neem) and soaps will kill the beetles effectively. They will not, however, provide ongoing protection. Japanese beetles are shiny, iridescent green and copper beetles that are typically about 3/8 of an inch (9.5 mm) long."

Try to spray them down on a warm, sunny day, allowing the water to evaporate quickly. For difficult or recurring infestations, a standard garden insecticide should do the trick. The insects can be multiple colors, but most resemble lice -- small, round, and numerous. Flowers like marigolds, sunflowers, daisies, and dill attract insects that eat aphids, bringing in a natural defense system."
