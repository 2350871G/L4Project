While Instagram and Twitter can be used to find a group for freecycling, Facebook would prove to be the most effective and user friendly for finding one. Facebook allows the user to do a direct search for local groups while Twitter and Instagram may present more of a challenge. Both Instagram and Twitter use symbols (hashtags \u201c#\u201d and at symbols \u201c@\u201d) to connect people together all around the world, thus making it more difficult to find a local organization to join."
