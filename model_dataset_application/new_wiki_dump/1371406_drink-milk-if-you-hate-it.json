          "headline":"Stir in chocolate or strawberry syrup.",
          "description":"Your local grocery store likely carries pre-made chocolate or strawberry milk. However, if you mix in your own syrup you can control the flavor better by adding as much syrup as suits your taste. Start by adding a small amount of syrup and stirring it vigorously. When that syrup is thoroughly dissolved in the milk, give it a taste and see if you want to add more. If you squeeze in a large amount of syrup at once, you'll just end up with a lot of syrup pooled at the bottom of your glass.Variation: If syrups are too sweet for you, try honey instead. There are a variety of types of flavored and herbal honey available. Try different combinations until you find one you like."

          "description":"Jams and preserves mix with milk fairly easily and can add a sweet flavor that disguises the taste of the milk. Thicker jams or preserves will also alter the texture. Highly acidic fruit, particularly citrus, kiwi, and pineapple, will curdle milk. The milk is still technically safe to drink. However, if you already dislike milk this will likely make your problem worse."

          "description":"Plenty of tea drinkers add milk to their tea, but you can also do it the other way around. The flavors in the tea will be absorbed by the milk, which may make it more palatable to drink. Chai tea is a particularly good flavor to mix with milk. Herbal teas can also provide an interesting flavor combination. Experiment until you find one you like."

          "description":"Hot cocoa can be a relaxing and indulgent treat when cold weather hits. If you're using a powdered hot cocoa mix, heat milk and stir it into the powdered mix. The easiest way to heat your milk is in the microwave. It shouldn't take more than 45 seconds to a minute for your milk to be warm enough for hot cocoa. You don't need to bring it to a boil."

Before you know it, your milk will be gone. Bread will be healthier for you than cookies if you plan to do this every day. You can also use biscotti, which is designed to be dunked in liquid before eating. There are many varieties of biscotti that aren't nearly as packed with sugar as cookies are.Did You Know? Dampening cookies or other baked goods allows for quicker and easier release of chemical compounds responsible for the flavor \u2013 so cookies and other baked goods may actually taste better when they're dunked."

If anything, your oatmeal may taste even better. Follow the instructions on the package carefully if you're using milk instead of water. Some brands require you to heat the milk separately and then stir in the oatmeal, while others require the milk and oatmeal to be heated together."

          "description":"Dry cereal in milk is a classic combination and also a way to get your milk in. Different types of cereal may also work to flavor the milk, so it doesn't taste like regular milk. Sugary cereals will typically disguise the taste of the milk the best. They're not as healthy for you to eat on a regular basis, but they're fine as a treat. Chocolate cereals will turn your milk into chocolate milk. Don't be afraid to combine tactics! For example, you might try cereal with slices of fruit and flavored milk."

Pulse until smooth. Some fruits, especially kiwis and fresh pineapples, may curdle the milk. The smoothie should be fine if you drink it right away. However, if you prepare a large amount in advance and leave it in the fridge, it will go bad."

          "description":"There are plenty of recipes, especially for casseroles and other baked goods, that already call for milk. Even if the recipe itself doesn't call for milk, you can typically substitute milk for other liquid ingredients without having any problems. For example, if you're making a condensed soup, such as tomato, from a can, you can add a can of milk instead of a can of water. It won't alter the flavor of the soup itself, and you may find you like the texture of the soup better. If you're eating a ready-to-eat canned soup that doesn't require you to add water, adding milk is probably not a good idea. However, if it's a chowder or cream-based soup, you can typically add a little bit of milk \u2013 it will just make the soup a little thinner."

Even ice cream provides significant amounts of calcium, although it's something you should eat in moderation. For example, you might have a serving of yogurt with your breakfast and a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch.

They can also be easily integrated into basically any meal. You can eat leafy greens as a side dish, use them on sandwiches, or stir them into soups or casseroles. For breakfast, try scrambling eggs with spinach, or make a spinach and mushroom omelet. You can also blend spinach or kale into a breakfast smoothie. Be aware that you will not absorb the nutrients from these plant sources as well as you would from an animal source.
