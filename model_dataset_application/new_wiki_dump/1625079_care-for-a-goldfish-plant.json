To make sure your goldfish plant gets the humidity it needs, place the pot on a shallow tray or saucer with pebbles in it and pour a little water into the tray. The water will evaporate and create moisture for the plant.Tip: Another way to create a humid environment for your plant is to keep it in a bathroom, where it can get plenty of steam from the shower. Don\u2019t put in so much water that it touches the bottom of the pot. This could cause the soil to become soggy. If your plant is in a hanging basket, you can instead mist it every day with lukewarm water. Don\u2019t use cold water, since this will damage the leaves."
