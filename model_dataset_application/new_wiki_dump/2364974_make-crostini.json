  "text":" Broiled Crostini Turn your oven onto Broil, and remove a cookie sheet to broil on. Line this cookie sheet with aluminum foil or with parchment paper to help ease the cleanup process. Melt together the butter and olive oil.  Add in the garlic, and any other seasoning as desired (no more than a dash of salt, and a shake or two of pepper though).  Slice the loaf into thin slices (around 1cm in thickness).  Dip each side of each slice into the butter & oil mixture.  Sprinkle each slice with cheese as desired.  Broil for 6-8 minutes, or until golden and crisp.  Remove from the oven, let sit for 2-3 minutes. Serve immediately if desired hot. Refrigerate until cool if desired cold. Quick Crostini Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC/350\u00baF. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon sheet. Slice the baguette into slices about 5-7mm in thickness.  Arrange the slices on a baking tray. Keep in a single layer; don't overlap. Pour the olive oil into a small bowl. Dip a pastry brush into the bowl and brush both sides of each baguette slice. You'll need to keep re-dipping in the olive oil. Season to taste. This step is optional but if liked, you can sprinkle the top of each piece with salt and pepper or perhaps with a spice such as paprika or sumac. Place the baking sheet into the oven. Bake for 5-6 minutes, then remove and turn over the slices. Return to the oven and bake for another 5-6 minutes or until golden. Remove from the oven. Place on a cooling rack to cool completely.
