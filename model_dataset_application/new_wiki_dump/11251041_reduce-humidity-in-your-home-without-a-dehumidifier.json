You don\u2019t need to open your windows all the way; just crack them 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm). Aim to open at least 2 windows on different sides of your home so the humid air can move throughout your home. If you can\u2019t open all of your windows, prioritize opening windows in those rooms where lots of moisture tends to build up (e.g., the bathroom).Warning: This may not be an effective solution if you live in a particularly humid area.

In general, replace the filter every 90 days to keep it running as smoothly as possible. If you have pets that shed hair, like cats or dogs, bump up this maintenance schedule and replace the filter every 60 days."

Fill a large bowl with one of these substances and place it in a room with lots of moisture for greatest effect. Refill this bowl every 2-3 days to make sure it's continually effective. There's no set amount of a dehumidifying substance that you need to put out for them to work. Aim to put out at least 1 large bowl in every room of your home. You can also buy commercial desiccants that draw moisture out of the air with calcium chloride. These can be bought at most hardware and home improvement stores."
