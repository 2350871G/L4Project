  "text":" Making Your List Grab a notebook/sheet of paper and a pen. Write down the list of what you want to put in your kit. Some ideas include: baking Equipment (spatula, sifter, measuring cup/spoons etc. ), a baking recipe book, cake mix, cute cookie cutters (bunnies, stars, snowmen, fairies etc. ), sprinkles, cupcake tray, baking cups, sugar decorations, candy (M&Ms, Smarties, cashews etc. ). Go shopping for all everything. Buy a basket big enough to hold all the items. Don't buy a recipe book. That will be explained later. Putting Together the Recipe Book Go and get your notebook/piece of paper and pen. Go through your recipe books and the internet and look for the best baking recipes you can find. Open up a Microsoft Word document (or something similar) on your computer. Type or copy and paste all the recipes in. Add a Table of Contents at the beginning and a title page. Remember to make it colourful and easy to read. Save the file and print it. Do not put in any recipes the recipient of the basket will/may be allergic to. Staple it together. However, if it is too thick to staple get a hole punch and punch a hole 1/4 of the way up and another 3/4 of the way up (the page). Get some sting/ribbon/colourful wool and tie a bow through the first hole. Repeat for the second hole. You can do this with as many holes as you want. Remember to tie the bow tightly and double knot the bow tightly. If you don't have time to make the recipe book or don't have a printer you can buy one but a homemade one feels like you put more work into the kit. If you don't have a printer you can ask a neighour/relation/friend to print it for you or go to a printing store (although you will have to pay for the last option). Remember to check the word document for typos before printing!  Putting it Together Arrange everything you bought in the basket in a pretty fashion. If desired, tie a bow with ribbon to the handle of the basket. Buy or make a card to put in the basket.  Give to recipient and watch them love it! ",
