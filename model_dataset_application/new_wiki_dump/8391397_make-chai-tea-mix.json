To begin making the masala, place the black pepper, dried ginger pieces and whole cloves into a small bowl. If you don\u2019t have access to the whole spices, you can substitute ground spices. Use \u00bd the amount of ginger, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon if you are using ground spices."

Use a small, sharp paring knife to make a small incision through one side of each pod of cardamom. Then place the pods in the bowl with the other spices.
