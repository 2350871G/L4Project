Next, set the temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius) to preheat the oven. Most ovens beep or flash an indicator light when the oven has reached the preheated temperature. Pay attention so you know when yours is ready."

          "description":"Find a 8-inch by 8-inch (20.32 cm x 20.32 cm) baking dish or pan for your shortcake. Use butter or a nonstick cooking spray to lightly grease the pan so the shortcake won\u2019t stick to it when it\u2019s time to remove it. If you prefer not to grease the pan, line it with parchment paper or a nonstick baking liner."

Mix until the ingredients are well blended. If you don\u2019t have a sifter, you can use a fine mesh strainer. Place it over the bowl and dump the flour in it, shaking it to help the flour pass through. If you don\u2019t have a sifter or strainer, use a whisk or fork to mix up the flour before adding it to the mixing bowl so it has a lighter texture."

Use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the dry ingredients. Continue working until the butter is cut into pieces that are as big as small peas. If you don\u2019t have a pastry cutter, you can use a fork or a butter knife to cut the butter into the flour."

Allow it to cool for approximately 20 minutes on a wire rack. To make sure that the shortcake bakes evenly, place it on the center of the oven rack.
