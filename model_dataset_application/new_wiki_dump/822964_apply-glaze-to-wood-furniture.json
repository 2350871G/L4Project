If the furniture you want to glaze does not already have a finish, apply one and allow it to dry completely before beginning. See our articles on staining and finishing wood for step-by-step instructions for processes that should take place before any glazing is performed. If your furniture is finished with shellac, don't use glazes containing asphaltum, as they can sometimes be hard to remove."

There is no single, \"definitive\" glaze \u2014 a huge variety of options are available. You can find commercial glaze at most hardware stores and paint shops (Sherwin-Williams, etc.) for reasonably cheap. However, it's not hard to fine-tune your glaze by mixing various commercial projects as well. For instance, to get a gorgeous dark chocolate-colored wood glaze, simply combine:Four parts clear mixing glaze\nTwo parts dark brown or mocha glaze\nOne part dark grey or asphaltum glaze\n\nYou can also combine clear mixing glaze (sometimes called \"glaze base\") with ordinary paints to make your own custom shades. Finally, many oil-based paints can be used as glazes when mixed with a little thinner or penetrol."

In general, glazes are quite easy to remove compared to paints, stains, and other finishes used for wood. However, you still want to avoid unnecessary cleanup work when possible, so good masking is still important (especially if you're working around non-wood substances that stain easily, like upholstery, etc.) In addition, you'll want to lay a heavy drop cloth beneath your work area to protect against accidental drips and spills."

However, for a standard glazing job, the following tools will be very helpful:\nOne application brush (either foam or bristled is fine)\nOne blending brush (soft-bristled; clean and dry)\nPan or tray to hold the glaze\nPaper towels or cotton rags\nSteel wool (oil-based glazes)\nNylon abrasive pad (water-based glazes)"

          "description":"Before you paint the glaze on the wood itself, it can be a wise idea to test it on a piece of wood that you have lying around, especially if it's similar to the wood you're using for your project. Glazes (like almost all pigments) can look a little different in liquid form than they do when painted onto a surface, so taking the time to test it can save you the headache of cleaning it off of your project later if it's not quite right. In a pinch, you can always test the glaze on part of the project that's not easily-visible (like a small area on a rear corner.)"

          "description":"When you're ready, dip your applicator brush in the glaze and spread it over the finished surface of the wood. Be sure to get plenty of glaze in any corners or cracks in the wood. You don't have to worry about applying to thickly (unless this causes it to drip or run) \u2014 you'll be removing most of it soon anyway. Most glazes take a reasonably long time to start drying compared to other wood finishes \u2014 usually, you will have about 10 to 20 minutes, which is plenty of time to glaze and work reasonable-sized sections of wood. Still, you'll want to keep this rough time limit in mind. If the glaze dries before you can work with it, you'll need to use a little paint thinner to get it liquid again."

          "description":"Glaze is applied in a very thin, translucent layer \u2014 it's not meant to act like an opaque paint. To get this effect, use paper towels or rags to wipe off most of the glaze after you've applied a generous layer over the wood surface. As long as you get the majority of the glaze off, you don't have to be perfect \u2014 in the next step you'll work with the glaze remaining on the wood to get the effect you want. Leave a little extra glaze around any corners, cracks, embellishments, or \"tight spaces\" on your wood. Most glazing styles deliberately keep these areas darker to highlight the features of the wood. Be sure to place the dirty paper towels or rags someplace they won't drip or get your surroundings dirty. Having a plastic garbage bag handy is a good idea."

          "description":"Now's your chance to leave your own personal mark on the wood. Use your second brush (which should ideally be soft-bristled, clean, and dry) to push the remaining glaze around, distributing the areas of dark (more glaze) and light (less glaze) as you wish. Use the towels or rags to dry the blending brush when it gets too wet. There's no \"right\" way to do this and different woodworkers will often prefer using different techniques to get different final products. Below are a few suggestions that should leave you with a rich, distinguished-looking piece of wood:\nLeave the glaze the thinnest at the center of flat surfaces. Leave slightly more around the edges. This gives a subtle \"cameo\" or \"sunburst\" effect. Let the glaze accumulate thickest around sharp corners, edges, cracks, and embellishments. This highlights these features by bringing out their contrast. Push the glaze away from the \"high points\" on emblems, embellishments, carvings, and so on to give them a warm \"shine.\""

          "headline":"Use abrasives to produce a grain.",
          "description":"Though it's certainly not required, you can custom-modify the texture of your wood with mild abrasives during the glazing process. Use steel wool for oil-based glazes and nylon abrasive pads for water-based glazes. Wipe gently with the abrasive to remove the glaze more gradually than you would with a paper towel or rag. This will also produce a slightly rough, \"grainy\" effect in the glaze which can enhance the character of the wood once it dries. Whether or not to use this \"grain\" effect depends on the project you're working on and the impression you want to create with the finished product. For example, while a rough grain can look great on a rich wooden desk, you'll probably want to keep your glaze smooth if you're working over a white-painted chest of drawers."
