The gauge does not reflect the size of the completed garment. To measure your yarn\u2019s gauge yourself, count the number of stitches over 6 inches (15cm), then divide that number by 6. Your answer will determine the gauge of your yarn. Just because two different yarns share the same gauge does not mean they will function the same within the confines of a pattern.

Sport is ideal for making baby clothes or blankets. Worsted is used to make blankets and sweaters, and bulky is perfect for scarves and rugs. When working with different yarn weights, make sure you also use the correct needle size and hook size for that yarn. When looking at weights, double check that you are also using the recommended brand for your pattern of choice."

Using the wrong yarn can completely alter your pattern, and since different yarns have different elasticity, you may find yourself running out of yarn altogether. To avoid running out of yarn, buy extra. Most yarn stores have a flexible return policy, and if not, you can always use your extra yarn in another project. If you are going to substitute yarn, make sure you replace your yarn with a yarn of a similar elasticity. Inelastic yarns include silk, linen, hemp, alpaca, tencel, bamboo, cotton and rayon."

If you\u2019re looking to make your stitches stand out, use a smooth, plied yarn in a solid color. The thickness of yarn is determined not by how many plies you have, but how thick the individual plies are. For example, a 4-ply yarn can be thinner than a 1-ply yarn, provided the plies in the 1-ply yarn are finer than in the 4-ply. If you\u2019re working with a wide yarn, choose a simple pattern."

Bright or novelty colors can distract or hide complicated work, so consider this when you\u2019re picking a colored yarn to work with your pattern. Choose a plain, solid yarn to make the texture and shape of your project pop. If you\u2019re working with Fair Isle patterns, choose smooth plied yarns in contrasting colors so your patterns will show up. Consider using hand painted yarn for a subtle watercolor technique. If you\u2019re a beginner, steer clear of novelty yarns. The yarn is harder to see and it makes fixing mistakes or ripping out stitches much more difficult."

Either pick a pattern that hangs straight, or ask a specialty store employee for elastic thread to help edge your pattern. Cotton and silk yarns both have very low elasticity. Animal fibers are warm and lightweight and ideal for making cold weather accessories. Plant based fibers are strong, durable and moisture wicking, making them ideal for spring and summer clothing. Cashmere is lightweight and durable, but more expensive. It is ideal for making scarves, shawls and sweaters."
