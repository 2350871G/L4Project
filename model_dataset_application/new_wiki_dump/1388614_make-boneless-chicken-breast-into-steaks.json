  "text":" If the pieces you purchased are thick, grab a very sharp knife and split each piece lengthwise, not quite cutting all the way through, and then opening it out flat (called a \"butterfly-steak\" cut), having the cut pieces equally sized would be a nice touch.  After you cut the chicken breast, wash and  tenderize each piece. Place on a large plate. Beat the eggs. Add salt to your taste and mix up carefully. Pour into a second plate/platter. Pour approximately 1/2 cup of the breadcrumbs (or such) into the third (flat) plate. You can add more later if you need. Pour the olive oil into the frying pan. Preheat on high for about 2-3 minutes prior to frying, being careful to not burn the oil. Place each side of a breast piece in the egg mixture. Then press it into the breadcrumbs and turn it over, coating both sides well with the breadcrumbs. Repeat the same process for each breast piece.  Turn the heat down to medium (approx. \"7.5-8\" on dial, if it's an electric range) to prevent burning. Place several of the coated pieces on the fry pan and start frying.
