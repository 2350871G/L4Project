From a long-standing German and Polish tradition of topping sausages, to ballpark hot dogs, sauerkraut adds a soft, acidic zing to any meal, not just when fatty meats are involved. Top your avocado toast with a forkful of sauerkraut or add a thin layer to any sandwich (not just the traditional Reuben), burger, or wrap (let the brine drip off first so your food doesn\u2019t get soggy). Top your scrambled eggs with a little sauerkraut in the morning and you\u2019ll feel full longer due to the cabbage\u2019s fibre content. Try it as a mac and cheese topper."

Make a simple salad of torn lettuce leaves, olive oil, lemon juice, and black pepper, then top with raw sauerkraut for a green salad with zing. Sauerkraut pairs well with everything from shredded apple and carrot to ginger and mango, so be creative. The sweetness of apples and carrots perfectly balance the zip of the sauerkraut. Add or substitute it in any time you would eat pickles."
