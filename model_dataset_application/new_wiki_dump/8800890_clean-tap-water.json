The water is filtered into the pitcher or dispenser when you pour the water into the carafe. This system removes lead and chlorine but doesn\u2019t remove fluoride, bacteria, or pesticides. This system is stored in the refrigerator. You have to replace the filter every couple of months. The pitchers are cheap, and the filters are usually under $10. You have to remember to replace the filters when needed, which can be inconvenient."

Water runs through a carbon bed filter. They are relatively cheap, so they won\u2019t break your budget. They remove a variety of contaminants, including some pesticides, radon, chlorine, some bacteria, and heavy metals like lead. Additionally, carbon filters leave the minerals in the water that are good for you. Read the package carefully to determine what the filter doesn\u2019t remove. It varies by model. Most carbon filters will not remove fluoride. These systems can be more expensive at first, but you only have to replace the filters once or twice each year."

However, it won\u2019t remove chlorine or chlorine byproducts unless paired with a carbon filter. Distillation takes out all the beneficial minerals. You can buy a home distillation system that can remove almost all contaminants."

          "description":"Reverse osmosis is a process where a large tank is attached to the water pipe under your sink. The water is pushed through filters that remove contaminants. Reverse osmosis wastes water during the purification process. Some models waste more water than others, from three to 20 times more water than it filters to use, so check the model before purchasing. This process eliminates bacteria, nitrates, asbestos, and heavy metals. This process leaves in chlorine but removes all beneficial minerals like fluoride. Check the label to see exactly what the model removes. These systems are expensive, ranging from $500 to $1000, though the overall filtering cost may be cheaper in the long run than other systems. You should replace the filter once each year."

You can ask about the source of the water. Groundwater is generally cleaner due to the natural filtering from the soil. Surface water has a tendency to pick up more pollutants. If they tell you that the EPA has tested the water, ask for the results. You can also ask for a copy of the test results since by law they have to provide you with information about water contaminants."
