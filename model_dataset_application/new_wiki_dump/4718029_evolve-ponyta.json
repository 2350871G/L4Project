      "description":"Fire-types are strong against Grass (like Bulbasaur, Bellsprout), Bug (Parasect, Caterpie), Ice (Dewgong, Abomasnow), and Steel-types (Steelix, Aggron). Fire-types like Ponyta will inflict twice the normal damage when it attacks any of these types during battle, allowing you to get easy wins and level up faster. Ponyta evolves to Rapidash only when it reaches level 40, so winning Pok\u00e9mon battles easy and fast will greatly help speed up leveling."

      "headline":"Avoid fighting types that fire is weak against.",
      "description":"On the contrary, Fire-types are seriously weak against Water (like Squirtle and Gyarados), Rock (Onyx, Geodude), and Ground-types (Diglet, Dugtrio). If Ponyta receives any attack from these kinds of Pok\u00e9mon, it will take twice the normal damage. Fighting lower level of these types can still beat Ponyta. If you encounter any of these types, call Ponyta back to the Pok\u00e9ball or flee from the battle to save time and HP. Sometimes the Pok\u00e9mon you are battling will not allow you to flee. Prepare for when this happens by buying some Pok\u00e9dolls or Pok\u00e9toys."

    {
      "headline":"Bring lots of potions into battle.",
      "description":"Taking lots of potions with you will greatly save time, without having to go back to towns and get Ponyta healed in Pok\u00e9mon Centers. Once Ponyta\u2019s HP gets low, open your Bag (by pressing the Start button) and use a potion on Ponyta to restore its health."

    {
      "headline":"Bring items that heal status conditions.",
      "description":"Some Pok\u00e9mon have skills that affect its opponents even after the battle. Moves like \u201cSing\u201d or \u201cPoison Sting\u201d can put your Pok\u00e9mon to sleep or poison it even after the battle. Leaving Ponyta with these conditions will either render Ponyta unusable on battles or slowly drain its life points. Items like \u201cAwakening\u201d and \u201cAntidote\u201d removes sleep or poison status conditions, respectively, on your Pok\u00e9mon and are used the same way as potions (step 3). On the other, status-removing items removes only the status condition and not restore life points. You\u2019ll still need potions to restore Ponyta\u2019s health."

    {
      "headline":"Have Ponyta eat Rare Candies.",
      "description":"If you don\u2019t want to level up Ponyta by grinding and doing the work, you can always use Rare Candies. These items raise any Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s level by 1 instantly, without having to gain any XP points. This is perfect for saving time, but each game version only have a limited number of Rare Candies available inside, so it\u2019s a little bit impossible to raise Ponyta all the way up to level 40 using only Rare Candies."
