Do this by either flipping the manure pile into the next composting bin or moving the center of the pile to the outside and the outside edges to the center. This will allow the manure to cure evenly throughout the pile. If you are using the pile method, you can aerate the compost pile by using a tractor, by hand, or by inserting PVC pipes into the pile to act as chimneys. If you do not roll the pile, composting will still occur, but it will take longer."

Test the moisture in the pile by squeezing a portion of the material from the center of the compost manure. If a few drops appear, the compost is in good shape. If there are a lot of drops or too few you will need to adjust the moisture content."
