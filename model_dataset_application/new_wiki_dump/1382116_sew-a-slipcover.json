Make sure the seam allowance is uniform. Insert the pins approximately every 2 inches (5 cm) along the lengths of seams. Make the task easier by poking T-pins into the furniture to keep the slipcover material from slipping while fitting the sections together. Eventually you'll have the slipcover completely pinned together inside out and atop the furniture."

After you're finished sewing, flip the slipcover over so that it's no longer inside out. Add decorative cording to the slipcover, if desired. Cover cord with leftover fabric. Sew the covered cord onto prominent seams that you want emphasized. Fabric for the cording should be 1 1/4 inch wide (3 to 4 cm)."
