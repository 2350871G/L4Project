Once you have the bare studs set up, you could just install shiplap boards on top of these. However, this sort of construction may or may not meet building codes or fire codes in your area. It will also be more difficult to insulate. Alternatively, install drywall or plywood over the bare studs, then shiplap boards on top of that. Note that plywood creates a better surface to nail the shiplap boards onto."

Prime or paint the existing wall first if the current color will clash noticeably with the color you want the shiplap wall to be. This is because there will be small, usually unnoticeable gaps between the shiplap boards. For instance, if your current wall is purple and you want the shiplap to be white, prime or paint the existing wall white first.
