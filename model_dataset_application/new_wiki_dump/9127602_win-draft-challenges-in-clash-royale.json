      "description":"Once you click battle, you go in a match. Two cards pop up side by side and you choose one of them for yourself and one for your opponent's decks. You each draft four cards for yourself and four for the other."

    {
      "headline":"Prepare yourself and your surroundings.",
      "description":"It would suck to have to quit in the middle of a game and lose one of your precious chances. Make sure you go to the bathroom, eat, drink, and have a steady internet connection before playing. Tell your family not to disturb you if they are around and make sure you have finished all homework before starting."

    {
      "headline":"Choose cards that need specific counters that your opponent may not have drafted.",
      "description":"These include Goblin Gang, Princess, Sparky, Inferno Tower, Inferno Dragon, Dart Goblin, Goblin Barrel, Cannon Cart, Balloon, Elite Barbarians, and Graveyard. If you catch your opponent without these counters in hand, they will deal lots of damage and help you win!"
    },
    {
      "headline":"Keep in mind what you are giving to your opponent.",
      "description":"If you pick a Graveyard, then don't give them counter's to Graveyard like Minions or Archers. You should pick good cards for yourself, but also create a bad deck for your opponent. Clone, Mirror, Rage, and Freeze less so should be given to your opponent 99% of the time. Draft is not only about creating a good deck for yourself but a bad deck for your opponent. Give them Lava Hound, Golem, and Three Musketeers so they have a deck with a huge average elixir cost and struggle to put down troops."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Pick a win condition.",
      "description":"These cards generally deal the most damage to the enemy's crown towers and without one, you may find your pushes never connect and do damage. Pick at least one and no more than three of these cards: Graveyard, Lava Hound, Giant, Golem, Hog Rider, Ram Rider, Battle Ram, Goblin Barrel, Three Musketeers, Balloon, Royal Giant, and Miner. Cards like Furnace, Mega Knight, and Skeleton Barrel can be considered win conditions but aren't as reliable as the ones above."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Choose the counter when faced with a choice between a card and its counter.",
      "description":"The counter usually helps make positive elixir trades for you. Pick Arrows over Minion Horde. Pick Log over Goblin Barrel. However, sometimes you may have a card that supports your win condition better but dies to the other card. Ex: When you already picked Graveyard, and you have a choice between Baby Dragon and Musketeer, take Baby Dragon even though it dies to the Musketeer. It will be a good tank for your Graveyard."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Draft a heavy spell and a light one if you can.",
      "description":"Cards with area denial like Log and Poison are especially good. Rocket and Lightning, the heaviest spells provide a ton of value and are awesome at finishing off towers. Spells are the most important cards in draft battles, so pick wisely."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Don't choose too quickly or automatically choose cards you like.",
      "description":"There's a minuscule chance of you drafting your favorite log bait deck. Even if you love playing Goblin Barrel, don't take it if you gave your opponent all the counters. Pick the other card even if you don't like it as long as it will make your draft deck better."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Surprise your opponent if you are stuck in a bad cycle.",
      "description":"Do this if you're attacking, your opponent is defending and then counter-attacks dealing damage to your towers. Rush the opposite lane with your attack. Your opponent will be surprised and may end up hesitating to let damage through."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Accept your losses and don't beat yourself up about it.",
      "description":"That will most likely lead to you getting flustered and losing even more. As all experienced players know, you should take a break and return later if you get angry. Challenges last for multiple days so you won't run out of time if you stop for a while."
