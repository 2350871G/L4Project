A scrub brush such as a toilet brush can be used to lift up and remove the algae. Skimming nets from a home improvement store also help reach the algae, but you can also yank out the algae by hand. Some string algae is beneficial to the pond\u2019s health. The algae that sticks on the pool liner, as long as its growth is under control, protects fish and combats green water caused by other algae. Try to control the algae using natural maintenance methods such as by adding plants, aerating the water, and removing waste yearly."

Add about one pint (.48 L) of store-bought hydrogen peroxide for every 1,000 gallons (3785.4 L) of pond water. Dilute it if possible by letting it run with a fountain, waterfall, or other moving water. Results will vary between ponds, but you can increase the amount of hydrogen peroxide as needed. Be careful though, because it can harm fish and plants. Chemicals such as String Algae Control are less harmful but more expensive options for existing algae problems."

Allow the bag to sit in the pond for several weeks, preferably where the water spreads, such as a fountain or waterfall, if possible. After a few weeks, the barley will start to degrade. Remove any rotting pieces to avoid adding more nutrients for the algae."

Plants such as anacharis, hornwort, and parrot\u2019s feather live under the water and keep the water full of oxygen, which limits algae growth. Lilies and lotus plants also cover the surface of the water, blocking sunlight that aids excessive algae growth. You introduce plants by planting them at appropriate layers. For example, submerged plants such as anacharis rests fully below the surface with its roots in a basket. Marginal plants, including cattails, and lilies are rooted in water with aquatic potting soil. Floating plants such as water hyacinths rest on the water\u2019s surface."

Plants, waterfalls, and fountains all help, but you can also add an aeration pump to keep the water mixed, preventing algae and odors. Install small pumps by attaching the water recirculating hose and placing the pump in the water away from dirt, such as on a block or rocks. Hide the open end of the hose away from the pump near some rocks. Plug the pump\u2019s power cord into an outlet, making sure it is away from water.

Don\u2019t offer extra food when it isn\u2019t needed. Monitor the water for leftover food and offer less as needed. Feed fish high-protein fish food, such as Pond Care Summer Staple, two to four times a day when the water is warm. Feed them once every day or two days with a low protein food when the water goes below 60 degrees F (15.5 degrees C)."
