Hold it in place the whole time you're taking the reading, as you don't want to go deeper into their body. Hold the baby or child still so that the thermometer doesn't break. Children may bite down on a thermometer if it's in their mouths, leading to glass shards and mercury in their mouths, which is why you shouldn't place a glass thermometer in their mouth. Plus, a rectal temperature is the most accurate for children."
