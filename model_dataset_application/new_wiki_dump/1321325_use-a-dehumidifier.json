This is measured in number of pints of water that will be extracted from the environment in a 24-hour period. The result will be a room with your ideal level of humidity. For example, a 500 square foot room that smells musty and feels damp would require a 40-45 pint dehumidifier. Consult a buying guide to determine the proper size for your needs. Dehumidifiers can accommodate up to 44 pints (20.8197 liters) per 24 hours in a space as large as 2,500 square feet (232.257 square meters)."
