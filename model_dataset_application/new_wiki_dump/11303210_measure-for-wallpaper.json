Once you have this number, all you have to do is multiply the pattern repeat number by the wallpaper roll amount, and you will know how much wallpaper your pattern will need. For example, if your pattern repeat number is 18 inches (46 cm) (or 1.5 feet (0.46 m)), and your wallpaper roll contains 33 feet (10 m), multiply 1.5 feet (0.46 m) by 33 feet (10 m) to get 49.5 square feet (4.60 m).
