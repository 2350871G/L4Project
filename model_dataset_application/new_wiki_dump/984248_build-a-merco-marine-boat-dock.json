Gather all your materials and tools. 2x8 PT SYP lumber for the frame, 2x6 PT SYP decking (or the decking of your choice), Merco Marine Galvanized Wood Dock Hardware, Merco Marine float drums, Merco Marine fasteners. The tools you will need are as follows: square, chalk line, pencil, hammer, tape measure, 2 C-clamps, power saw, pliers, 1/2\" drill bit, 1/4\" drill bit for float drums, 3/4\" socket and wrench, 9/16\" open end wrench, power drill.

      "description":"We typically build wood frame dock in 20' sections of varying (even) widths. However, you the private homeowner may have trouble finding and transporting 20' lumber. Remember, the two exterior stringers run the entire length of your dock so their length is the same as the dock length. The interior stringers are 3\" less than the exterior stringers (interior stringers are placed 2' on center, and 2' o.c. from the side of the dock). End stringers are also placed inside the full-length side stringers, so they measure 3\" less than the width of your dock."

This method just makes it easier to hold together while attaching hardware. A nail gun even makes it easier. You will be building the frame right side up so make sure the top of the frame is level (decking will not fit level if they are not)."

If you are adding fingers to the end of your dock, Merco has hardware with tabs on both sides of the hardware. Set float drums in the right location. Make sure they are square and flush to the side stringers. Use a 1/4\" drill and drill side stringers for lag bolts. Attach floats with a 3/8\" x 3\" or larger lag bolt. Use a 3/8\" washer and a 1/2\" washer for a larger bearing surface on the float drum. These, as well as all other fasteners should be hot dipped galvanized. Just before decking, place the plastic plug in float drum. (After the decking is on, the floats, especially in the water will remain at a more constant temperature and will not swell up.

(If you use method 1, screw boards down, tighten, using a chalk line, cut all deck boards off to length.) Use a chalk line to determine where deck screws are to go - using 2\" x 6\" decking, use two deck screws for each stringer. If you are using wet pressure treated wood you can hold decking close together. In a few weeks this wood will dry out and you will have a nice space between boards. If you use plastic or vinyl decking, you will have to space between boards. (Do not fasten down boards where you have to tighten down hardware.) Attach cleats - drill down through decking into cleat angles with 3/8\" drill. Drive 3/8\" bolts, place on washer, nut and tighten. Nail down outside corner bumpers with stainless ring shank large head nails. Four nails on top and four nails on the bottom. Attach rub rail using the same stainless nails. We recommend a nail every 6\" top and bottom. Fit the sections together and put in the pins to hold together. This is a little work but will be worth it when you put the dock in the water and it doesn't fit together. If you want to skip this, at least put pins in hardware to make sure they fit. Sometimes there is excess galvanizing which needs to be cleaned out with a 25/32\" drill bit.",
