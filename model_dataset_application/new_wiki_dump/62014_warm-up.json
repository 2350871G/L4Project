          "description":"Warming up is not just an expression -- you actually want to heat up your body. Warm muscles are looser and thus stretch better without the risk of injury. Get on your favorite cardio machine and move for 5-15 minutes, working your heart rate up as well. Of course, you should think about adjusting your warm up depending on the activity:\nIf you're going to be running, a light jog or bike ride is far and away the best warm up. If you're lifting, jog for 15-20 minutes. Then do a few very easy reps in your muscle group, or full-body reps like push-ups and pull-ups. Even if you're just doing arm day, a good warm up is key. A higher heart rate will send essential blood to your tired muscles as you lift."

          "description":"Exhaling as you bend, drop down with a curved back and reach for the floor. Then bend backward as well, exhaling and slowly arcing back. Twist from your hips, keeping your feet firmly on the floor, in both directions. Finally, bend sideways, again from the hips. A few other little exercises to try include:\n20 ankle rotations -- with your weight on the opposite foot, spin your foot from the ankle. Turn in both directions. To stretch your neck, flex your head forward/backward, side to side and look right and left. Roll your wrists 10 times clockwise, then 10 times counterclockwise. Roll and rotate your shoulders. Work in both directions, making as big of circles as feels comfortable.

Her workouts emphasize proper warm-ups, cool-downs, and stretching techniques. Monica Morris\t\t\tACE Certified Personal Trainer\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: When you're warming up, start with static stretches. That means you're stretching just one muscle, like your arms, your legs, your shins, and your calf muscles. Then, you can move into dynamic stretches, which will get your heart rate going. Those might include doing jump jacks, high knees, or swinging your arms from side-to-side."

This warm-up looks ridiculous, but really does have full-body democrats. To do one, lay on the floor with your knees up and feet firmly planted. Then... Squeeze your abs and butt muscles together. Bring your hips up to the ceiling. Keep your shoulders and feet on the floor. Do not use your hamstrings to lift yourself. Slowly lower back down to the ground. Repeat 10-15 times."

          "description":"A dynamic warm up is moving your body to stretch instead of \"bend and hold,\" which can cause injury. Dynamic warm-ups simulate the actual movement of your body, just without weight, and they keep your blood moving to activate all of your muscles. Pick at least three of the following:\n50 jumping jacks\n20 body weight squats\n2-3 minutes jump rope\n5-10 lunges\n10-15 knee high jumps (jump with both feet and bring knees to chest)."

By warming up the smaller muscles now, you prevent injury later. Do 25-40 yards of each exercise. High Knees: Lift your knee up to stomach height with every step. Focus on landing and springing back up from the balls of your feet. Butt Kicks: As you run, kick you own rear with your heel after every step, over-exaggerating the running motion. Shuffle Step: Facing sideways, move laterally off the balls of your feet. Keep your spine straight and your shoulders over your ankles. Make sure to focus on both directions. Other options: Try out skipping, two-footed leaps, running backward, lunges, and bounding."

Hip Openers: Walking sideways (side to side), lift your front knee up to your hip. Slowly rotate your knee away from your body, turning you to face the other direction. Repeat with the other foot. Hip Closers: Walking laterally, pick up your back leg and rotate it in front of your body. Turn on your other foot so that you face the opposite direction. Repeat."

The front knee should be bent at a right angle. Rest on the toes of your back foot. Drop your hips down towards the ground, keeping your front knee bent at 90. Keep your spine straight as your drop. Slowly raise your hips up. Step forward with the opposite foot and repeat. Repeat 10-15 times on each side."

          "headline":"Avoid vigorous static stretching, or \"bend and hold\" stretching.",
          "description":"Static stretching is the classic \"grab and hold for 10 seconds\" stretch. Many studies show that static stretching can actually decrease by performance by tearing muscle fibers. Note, however, that static stretching is good for cool downs or post-workout stretching. After warming up, limit yourself to a few light 10-15 second stretches on any muscles that are still sore. A stretch should never hurt -- don't push yourself through pain to get a \"better\" stretch. You're only making yourself more injury prone."

Static stretching slightly tears your muscles, but this is actually a good thing -- it clears scar tissue so that your muscles can heal in a smoother, stretchier way.

You should have at least one large glass of water an hour before working out, and you should be sipping water before, during, and after the session. This keeps your brain active and you muscles charged and loose. Constantly sipping water, instead of chugging it all at once, will keep you hydrated without feeling full. If you feel thirsty, you're already dehydrated. Try to stay ahead of thirst."

A meal low in fat and high in protein -- PB&J and banana, protein shake, grilled chicken salad, tuna fish, etc. -- will give you the energy you need to work out at your best. This is the part of warm-up many people neglect, thinking they should wait to eat until after they work out. If running, try to eat roughly two hours before leaving. If lifting, you can eat closer to an hour. Your goal is to be just a little bit hungry, or perfectly content when you start. You shouldn't be full or starving. If you need, eat a small bar, pack of pretzels, or another simple carb 20-30 minutes before working out for a little boost."

More importantly, it expands your \"range of motion,\" or the area you can reach with each muscle. Having different exercises will allow you to develop strength and flexibility more naturally, leading to overall higher health and strength. That said, you should keep your warm up roughly the same -- a little routine is not a bad thing if it helps you stay loose."
