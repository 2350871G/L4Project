  "text":" Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. This will help promote a better sear later on. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. (You can add your own spices if you want.) Place the chicken in a pot of moderately hot oil. Safflower is recommended as it has a light taste and a high smoke point so it will not burn easy. Sear the chicken (one side only). This will enhance the flavor of the dish and the texture of the meat. Add 48 oz broth, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and bay leaves to chicken in the pot. Bring to a slow boil. Cover the pot and turn heat to low.  Cook rice and set to the side.  Remove bay leaves when the chicken starts to break apart (after four or five hours).  Turn heat up again and bring the pot to a slow boil.  Remove the chicken from the pot, place it on a plate.  Start to shred and pull apart the chicken. (Using two forks works quite well.) Shred it all. (The size does not need to be consistent.) Add chicken back to the boiling liquid in the pot.  Add cooked rice.  Crack 6-7 eggs into a bowl and add in 1/2 cup lemon juice.
