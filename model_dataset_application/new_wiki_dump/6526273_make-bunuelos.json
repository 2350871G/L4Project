          "headline":"Combine the dry ingredients.",
          "description":"Place the flour, baking powder, salt, and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of sugar in a large bowl. Stir until combined. While not strictly necessary, consider sifting the flour once or twice before adding the other ingredients. Doing so removes lumps and introduces air into the mixture, which should create lighter bu\u00f1uelos."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add the egg, butter, and vanilla.",
          "description":"Form a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add the egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract to the center of that well. Mix to combine. When mixing in these liquid ingredients, knock a little flour from the sides of the well into the liquids, then mix without disturbing the rest of the well. Repeat, working with small amounts of the flour mixture at a time. Once the liquids are thick enough to hold their form, you can incorporate them into the rest of the flour. Continue mixing until all the ingredients are combined and the resulting dough seems like coarse crumbs."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Gradually add the water.",
          "description":"Add warm water to the dough 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time, mixing after each addition. Continue until you've added 3/4 cup (80 ml) of water total. Once the dough comes together, start kneading it after each addition, too. Continue working with the dough for about 5 minutes, or until it seems soft, stretchy, and smooth."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Let the dough rest for 30 minutes.",
          "description":"Cover the bowl of dough with a clean towel and set it aside. Let it rest in room temperature to warm conditions for approximately 30 minutes. Continue with your preparations as the dough rests."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Meanwhile, mix the cinnamon and remaining sugar.",
          "description":"Combine the cinnamon with the remaining 1 cup (250 ml) of sugar. Stir until evenly mixed. Set aside the cinnamon-sugar mixture until later. You'll use this as a topping for the bu\u00f1uelos once they're done."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Heat the oil.",
          "description":"Pour 1 inch (2.5 cm) of oil into a large frying pan with heavy sides. Set it on the stove over medium-high heat. The oil will need to reach a temperature between 350 and 360 degrees Fahrenheit (177 and 182 degrees Celsius) before you can fry the bu\u00f1uelos. Monitor the temperature of the oil using candy or frying thermometer. You should also prepare your working area at this time. Sprinkle flour over the counter and over the rolling pin. Line a plate with clean paper towels or brown paper bags."

          "headline":"Divide the dough into 12 balls.",
          "description":"After 30 minutes pass, divide the batch of dough into 12 small, evenly sized balls. If the dough starts sticking to your hands, dust your hands with flour before you continue working with it."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Flatten the dough.",
          "description":"Flatten each ball of dough using a rolling pin, inverted bowl, or your hands. Each portion should be flattened until it is very thin and roughly 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter. To use a rolling pin: place the dough on your floured work surface and roll over it until you get an evenly round tortilla. To use an inverted bowl: place a pastry towel over the bowl and spread the ball of dough over it. Use your hands to gently stretch the dough over the sides of the bowl, pulling down on the dough very gently as you work. To use your hands: dust your hands with flour and pat each ball of dough in between them. Gently pat and stretch the dough into a round tortilla."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Fry until crispy.",
          "description":"Place the raw dough into the hot oil. Fry each bu\u00f1uelo for about 3 minutes, turning once halfway through. When ready, the bu\u00f1uelos should become puffy, crispy, and golden brown. Note that you should only fry one portion of dough at a time. Add more oil as needed and check the temperature in between batches."

        {
          "headline":"Drain off the excess oil.",
          "description":"Remove the finished bu\u00f1uelo from the hot oil and transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels. All the excess oil to drain off for several seconds."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Serve with cinnamon-sugar.",
          "description":"Sprinkle the finished bu\u00f1uelos with the cinnamon-sugar mixture and enjoy them while they're still warm. If you pile the finished bu\u00f1uelos together, they should remain warm until you finish frying the last one. If they seem too cool, however, preheat your oven to its lowest setting and place the batch of bu\u00f1uelos inside for 5 minutes."

          "description":"Place the grated cheese, cornstarch, tapioca starch, sugar, eggs, salt, butter, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix the ingredients together until a soft, smooth dough forms. Traditionally, Colombian bu\u00f1uelos are made with a cheese called queso coste\u00f1o, which is nearly impossible to find outside of Columbia. To obtain a similar flavor, use 1-1/2 cups (150 g) of Mexican queso fresco plus 1/2 cup (50 g) of dry feta cheese. If queso fresco is unavailable, you could use fresh farmer's cheese."

If one is available, you may use a deep fryer instead of a deep pan. Use a candy or frying thermometer to monitor the temperature of the oil. The maximum temperature should be 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius), but you can probably cook the bu\u00f1uelos without difficulty once the oil reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius)."

Fry the bu\u00f1uelos in small batches to avoid over-crowding the pan. They should be able to float around without knocking into one another. Expect the balls of dough to sink when you first drop them into the oil. After 30 to 60 seconds, though, bubbles should gather around the sides and the ball should float to the top. You'll need to stir and turn the bu\u00f1uelos with a slotted spoon as they start browning. Otherwise, they may not brown evenly."

Let the oil drain off for at least 30 to 60 seconds. Pile the drained bu\u00f1uelos onto a separate dish while you finish the entire batch. The residual heat from the latest ones should help keep the earlier ones warm while you finish frying."
