      "description":"There are lots of container possibilities but the most important factor is ensuring that the containers will show off the green candies inside. As such, clear glass or plastic containers are an optimal choice, along with containers that lift up the candies and show them to their best advantage. Try bowls, glasses, sundae glasses, jars (including Mason jars), vases, dishes and platters. Tall stemmed glasses with wide brims can be especially effective, such as those used for cocktails. Tins and other opaque objects can also be used provided it is obvious to the guest as to what is inside."

      "description":"The best implements are scoops and mini tongs, which will allow guests to collect a few candies at a time without being tempted to use their fingers. Maintaining the hygiene when many people are sharing the buffet is essential! Provide small plates, bowls, baskets or other containers for guests to scoop their candies into."

Some ideas include:\nGreen jelly beans and green gummy bears and other gel candies\nGreen wrappers on any kind of candy\nGreen wrapped chocolates and green chocolate; green Easter eggs if it's around Easter season\nGreen lollipops, suckers and any other candy on a stick\nGreen boxes of candies\u2013\u2013the candies inside don't necessarily need to be green if the packaging is green, as it will simply look great on the buffet table\nGreen candy sticks, green rock candy\nGreen licorice\nGreen marzipan figures\nGreen mints\nGreen toffees, caramels\nGreen taffy."

      "description":"Consider using a green tablecloth for covering. If this is too much though, use white as it's a forgiving background for all-one-color themes. Plan out how you will arrange the containers on the buffet table, along with scoops, tongs and serving plates, etc. Some suggestions include:\nKeep the larger items to the back and the smaller ones to the front\nProvide green napkins (serviettes) for sticky fingers\nAvoid having the tablecloth touch the ground or get in the way of the guests; with many people milling around the table, there is a risk of it all being pulled down\nPlace anything delicate away from the edge of the buffet table\nEncourage guests to help themselves by making it obvious where the plates and scoops are\nConsider having an area for sweet food that meets the needs of diabetics, vegans, gluten-intolerant, etc. guests so that they don't feel left out.
