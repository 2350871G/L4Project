Pruning an apricot plant in the summer enables the tree to heal quickly and seal itself from moisture, which can cause damage and introduce disease. Trim your tree as soon as possible after harvesting fruit. At this stage, the tree will still be in a growth phase and will be able to heal more quickly. Pruning in late summer gives your apricot tree more time to grow new branches, which means that your tree will produce more apricots next year."
