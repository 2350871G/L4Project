Turn the dial on your boiler clockwise until the arrow on the dial points to the correct time. If you need change the time to earlier in the day, keep spinning the dial clockwise to make a full rotation. Many mechanical timers have a 24-hour clock. Make sure the dial is turned to the right time if it\u2019s in the morning or afternoon. Some mechanical timers have a larger clock face on the front of the dial so it\u2019s easier to see the time."

          "description":"The pins around the dial each turn your boiler on or off for 15 minutes at a time. Look on the dial to find the time you want your boiler to start and change the pin to the \u201cOn\u201d position. Turn on the rest of the pins for the duration you want your boiler to run. Leave the pins alone if you don\u2019t want the boiler on during that time. For example, if you want your boiler to turn on from 7-8 AM, then set the 4 pins between 7 and 8 to the \u201cOn\u201d position. Some programmers may have you move the pin away from the center of the dial while others will make you push the pin toward the center. Look at the owner\u2019s manual to confirm which way to move your pins. You can choose to set your boiler to turn on and off multiple times throughout the day.Tip: Set your boiler to turn on 30 minutes earlier than when you want hot water since it usually takes that amount of time to heat up your home entirely."
