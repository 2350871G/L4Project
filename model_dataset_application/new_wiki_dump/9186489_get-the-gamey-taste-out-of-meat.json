Prompt field dressing will help cool the carcass down faster and stop the enzyme production that contributes to a gamey taste. If you're field dressing an elk or other large animal, you may need to do all your work in the same spot, since the animal will be difficult and time-consuming to move. If you're a beginner, start small by field dressing a rabbit."

The longer you soak your meat in a marinade, the more flavor it will absorb, so let it sit longer if you want to further mask the taste of the meat. Limit the marinating to 12 hours, since the meat could end up tasting too strongly of marinade."

The fat will be a lighter color than the rest of the meat, and it will have a slimier texture. Pinch the fat between two fingers and pull it away from the meat. Then use a chef's knife to slice it off."
