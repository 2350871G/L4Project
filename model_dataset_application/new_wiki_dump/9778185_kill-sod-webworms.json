Watering the grass before you apply an insecticide will help the chemicals penetrate the grass better. It will also force the caterpillars to the surface of the grass. You can use either a spray or a granular insecticide. If you use a spray solution, apply at least 15\u201325 gallons (57\u201395 L) of insecticide for every 1,000 square feet (93 m) of grass. If you use a granular insecticide, apply it with a fertilizer spreader. Follow the label\u2019s irrigation instructions: usually granular insecticides are followed by about an hour of watering to ensure the granules get down into the turf."

The soap will irritate the caterpillars, forcing them to the surface of the grass. This will allow you to see the extent of the infestation.
