The cards that you'll need from it are: Blue-Eyes White Dragon, White Stone of Legend, Dragon Shrine, Trade-In, Cards of Consonance, One for One, and Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon. Other cards that are good to keep are Maiden with Eyes of Blue, Silver's Cry, Call of the Haunted, and Honest."

      "description":"White Stone of Ancients, Sage with Eyes of Blue, Dragon Spirit of White, and Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon are must-haves. Master with Eyes of Blue, Protector with Eyes of Blue, Mausoleum of White, and Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon are decent, and can be added in if you like."

      "headline":"Get 3 copies of Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon, available in the Dark Side of Dimensions Movie Pack, and 3 Return of the Dragon Lords, available in the Rise of the True Dragons Structure Deck.",
      "description":"These, as well as the Shining Victories cards, should probably be bought individually."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Get the important monsters.",
      "description":"You need 3 copies each of Blue-Eyes, White Stone of Ancients, Sage, as well as around 2 Dragon Spirit of White and White Stone of Legend. Other cards you can run are Glow-Up Bulb, which can make more Synchros, and Dragon Core Hexer, which can be used to summon Ultimaya Tzolkin and Ultimaya Bishbaalkin. Galaxy Soldier, 2 or 3 copies, is also good to run, as a way to make Cyber Dragon Nova and Infinity."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Add spells.",
      "description":"The Blue-Eyes deck relies a lot on its spells. You will need 3 copies of Return of the Dragon Lords, Melody of Awakening Dragon, and Trade-In, and 2-3 Dragon Shrine.You can also use 1-2 Cards of Consonance, with an increased number of White Stones."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Add staples.",
      "description":"2 Twin Twisters or Cosmic Cyclone, 1 Soul Charge, 1 Upstart Goblin, and 1 One for One. Raigeki if you can get it. If you want, you can add Pot of Desires, at 2-3 copies. Desires is usually a must for competitive decks. If you have room for traps, you can run Solemn Warning or Solemn Strike, but Blue-Eyes is usually not a trap heavy deck. Also add some good handtraps - Ash Blossom and Ghost Ogre are best if you can get your hands on them, but currently expensive. If you don't have them, you can run 2 Effect Veiler. Also get Maxx \"C\". Kaijus are good to add to the Main or Side Deck. Gameciel is the most popular Kaiju but currently somewhat pricy; Kumongous will do fine as well."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Build the Extra Deck.",
      "description":"Synchros: If you have Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon, a good number of your extra deck slots will be dedicated to its effect, which tributes itself to summon a Light Dragon Synchro monster. Get 2-3 Spirit and 2 Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon, 1 Stardust Spark Dragon, 1 Black Rose Moonlight Dragon, and 1 Michael the Arch-Lightsworn. Crystal-Wing Synchro Dragon is a good addition because you can summon it by tributing Spirit for a Level 7 Synchro and tuning it with a Level 1. You can also add Cloudcastle to revive used Azure-Eyes and make True King of All Calamities. Xyz: Blue-Eyes can make Rank 8 Xyzs like no other deck. Get Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy, Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand, Lancelot, Dark Knight of the Underworld, and Alsei the Sylvan High Protector. If you can get Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter or Galaxy-Eyes Full Armored, use them with Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon. Other good cards include Heliopolis, Aegaion, and Giant Grinder. Whatever Rank 8s you can get your hands on is fine here. Blue-Eyes can also make Rank 1 in a pinch, so Sylvan Princessprite can be a good choice. Fusions: Twin Burst can be summoned easily without needing a fusion card. If you include a fusion card, like Dragon's Mirror, you can summon First of the Dragons, Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon, Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon, and Five-Headed Dragon. No fusions are recommended."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Consider Chaos Max.",
      "description":"This is a common variant to the deck. This build focuses on the new Ritual, Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon, and sacrifices some consistency and resiliency to be able to bring out a powerful monster which is hard to deal with and could win games. This build uses 3 Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands, 3 Chaos MAX, and various ratios of Advanced Ritual Art and Chaos Form as Ritual Spells. Dragon Core Hexer is also good to use."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Consider another hybrid, Felgrand.",
      "description":"You can just add a few copies of Arkbrave Dragon and/or Divine Dragon Lord Felgrand, or you can add the Level 4 Felgrand support as well (Guardian of Felgrand, Paladin of Felgrand, Dragon Knight of Creation). The Level 4s are much slower than the support Blue-Eyes has just on its own, so they're more for if you want to run Felgrand with a Blue-Eyes engine, rather than competitive Blue-Eyes. Dragon Ravine is also good. Ruins of the Divine Dragon is not recommended because of Blue-Eyes's Extra Deck reliance - if you want to make use of it, it's better to play pure Felgrand."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Go budget-friendly if you need to.",
      "description":"If you cannot get the new support from Shining Victories, a budget build can also be decent. Even just 3 of the structure deck is a casually playable deck. You can add some of the Felgrand support to shore up your deck if you can't get the better support cards. You can also play a build with Maiden with Eyes of Blue and Mausoleum of White if you can't get Sage. The other good Tuners are Master and Protector with Eyes of Blue. Some other good support to consider is more copies of Silver's Cry, Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, Keeper of the Shrine, Dragon Ravine, Call of the Haunted, and Queen Dragun Djinn, if you run Level 4s."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Experiment as you'd like to.",
      "description":"Blue-Eyes can also be played as an Invoked variant or a Chaos variant. There isn't usually much variety in a Blue-Eyes deck, because the build is so formulaic, but feel free to experiment."
