Sometimes quinces that look beautiful outside can have brown parts inside or they might contain a visitor (like a worm).

      "description":"Place the cubes of quince and the sugar in a pot. Stir the fruit so that the sugar is distributed evenly. Leave to stand overnight. Quinces release juice which will form a syrup when mixed with sugar . The color of the quince will change because oxidation occurs. This process is normal. It is not necessary to place them in the refrigerator. Allow the fruit and sugar to rest for at least 5 hours."

      "headline":"Cook the quinces.",
      "description":"Cover the pot and cook over high heat until the mixture of quince and syrup starts to boil. Let it boil for 4 or 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, reduce heat to medium and let the quinces cook for about 1 hour (larger amounts of quinces require a longer cooking time). To prevent burning, use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture occasionally. The quinces are ready when they are soft and bright, and their color has changed significantly (the final product can vary from reddish to honey color, depending on the quince you use)."
