If you're looking to shrink a shirt as much as possible, high heat is the best way to go. Remove the pot from the stove. Submerge the shirt in the hot water.

If you bought a new shirt and want to shrink it before wearing, washing the shirt on hot will tighten the fibers and reduce its size slightly. Hot water may cause some fabrics to bleed or fade, wash the shirt alone to avoid damaging other clothes. The agitation of the washing machine in top load machines will crinkle fabrics and lead to more shrinkage than a front loading machine."
