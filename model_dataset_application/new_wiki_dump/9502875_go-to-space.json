          "description":"Because commercial space travel is such a new industry and there are only a few companies planning to offer space tourism in the foreseeable future, the price for a ticket on a commercial spacecraft can be incredibly expensive, ranging from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of USD. Also, since no companies are sending tourists to space at this time, you'll likely be paying a large sum of money to reserve a seat for a future, unconfirmed date. If money isn't an issue for you, reserving a seat on a future commercial spaceflight may be one of your best chances to travel to space."

While there isn't a set date for when these spacecraft will be open to the public, some companies are claiming that they'll be able to start commercial operations within a few years. Depending on the company, you might be able to reserve a spot in advance. Other companies that are working on commercial space travel that you can look into include Blue Origin (founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos), Space Adventures, and XCOR Aerospace.Did you know? Registration to fly to space with Virgin Galactic aboard one of their commercial spacecraft at a future date is open to the public, and a ticket costs 250,000 USD.

In order to become an astronaut, you'll need to be a citizen of a country that actually sends people into space. If you're really passionate about becoming an astronaut but your country doesn't have a space agency that needs them, you could always become a citizen of a country that does have a space agency that sends astronauts to space, like the U.S. or a country within the European Union.Tip: You can find a list of all of the countries with operating space agencies at https://www.wmo-sat.info/oscar/spaceagencies."

Also, you should plan on getting an undergraduate degree in something like math, science, or engineering if you don't already have one since most space agencies will require one.

To make sure you up for it, adopt a healthy lifestyle by eating healthy foods and getting in routine exercise each week. To eat healthy, focus on eating a variety of healthy foods, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products. You should also make sure you're eating plenty of protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. To exercise, aim to get in around 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise\u2014like walking, running, and playing sports\u2014once a week, as well as strength-training exercise twice a week. In addition to being physically fit, there may be other physical requirements, like having 20/20 vision or falling within a certain height range."

While these traits may vary depending on your space agency's requirements, in general, you should work on being flexible, good at working with a team, and able to function well under pressure. You should also love to learn new things. If you're still in school, joining academic clubs can be a great way to develop good interpersonal skills and a passion for learning. To become more flexible and able to adapt to change, try new things and put yourself out there as much as possible, even if you're a little nervous. Exposing yourself to new situations is a great way to develop the skills you need to be flexible."

After you complete school, try to find work doing something that's related to your degree, which will help you meet the experience requirements and also better prepare you for being an astronaut. For example, NASA requires 3 years of professional experience or 1,000 hours of pilot-in-command time spent flying a jet aircraft. Depending on your space agency's requirements, you may be able to supplement this professional experience with an advanced degree, like a master's or doctorate."

After you submit your application, you'll likely be required to undergo a variety of interviews, tests, and physical exams to determine if you're qualified for the job. Keep in mind that the application process for becoming an astronaut is highly competitive. For example, in 2016, NASA received over 18,000 applications, and only 120 of those applicants were called in for the first round of interviews. Even if you don't make the cut the first time you apply, you can still apply again and work on improving your qualifications in the meantime."
