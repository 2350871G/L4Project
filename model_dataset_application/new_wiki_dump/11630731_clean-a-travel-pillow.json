Add a mild detergent and gently mix it into the water. Make sure your container is full enough that your travel pillow will be fully submerged. You should always use mild detergent when you wash memory foam so that you don\u2019t harm your pillow. If you use your travel pillow often, you should wash it twice a year."

Use cool water that is just below room temperature to rinse all of the detergent out of your pillow. Keep rinsing until there is no soap residue coming out of the pillow anymore, or for about 5 minutes. Leaving soap residue inside of your pillow can harm it in the long run."
