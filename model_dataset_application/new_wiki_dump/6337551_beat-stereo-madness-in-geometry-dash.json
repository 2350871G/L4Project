  "text":" First Cube Section Jump over the first two spikes. When you get to the \"stairs\", just jump on all of them (the last one doesn't matter). Jump over the first two spikes. Once you get to where there are blocks, just jump onto them. Watch out for the staircase at about 14%. Just keep jumping. Navigate the next section. This part looks a little confusing at first, but you can jump-drop-jump-drop or just jump four times. Then, you have to drop under the next platform, and jump out of the hole so that you don't smack the wall. Find the third staircase, similar to the second one in style. However, for the last block you have to drop to avoid a spike. First Ship Section Use the ship. To do this, you tap/press/click to go upward, and release to go downward. Going up or down gives you upward/downward momentum. Try to aim for the middle. If you can mostly stay in the middle, you are pretty much good to go. Watch out for the part where you will have to drop down a bit.  Look out for a staircase looking part going upward. You have to fly up a bit to avoid this one. Avoid smacking into the wall at the end.  Second Cube Section Jump over a spike. Then there will be a staircase. If you jump three times, then drop twice, or jump twice, drop, and jump, then you will get a gold coin. Gold coins unlock icons, colors, and even two levels. Watch out for a longer staircase next. Jump all the way up; then there will be a downward staircase type section with gaps that you have to jump over. Look out for the red background. Once the background turns red, things get a little trickier. You have to jump twice to get on to a platform, drop, jump twice, drop and immediately jump. Tackle the two spike jump, and the following three spike jump. The three spike jump will require a great deal of precision; try to jump as late as possible without dying on the spike. Jump through the next set of obstacles. There will be a couple of one spike jumps, a staircase, a downward staircase, another jump, a place where you can't jump, another pretty easy jump, and another platform staircase. Look out for blocks above and below the next area. If you jump onto the top blocks, you will get a gold coin. Be careful, on the last of those blocks (below the gold coin), there is a spike you have to jump over. Otherwise, you can just drop. Just jump three times through the next section. It may look confusing, but three jumps should do the trick. Drop twice, and look out for another three spike jump. Then, you'll jump three times, drop twice, and jump twice, wait a tiny bit, then jump until you get to the /GameMode:ShipFlyer portal. Enter the final ship zone. There, you go between two obstacles, go above one, go below one,  and go between three more. If you want to get the gold coin, you fly straight up right before the second obstacle, and there will be a hidden path in the top part of the obstacle. Then, you have to go through a complicated and difficult sequence to get the final gold coin.",
