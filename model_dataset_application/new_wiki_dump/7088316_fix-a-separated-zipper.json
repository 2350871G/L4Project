          "description":"Many times when the sides of a zipper separate and won't go back together as you pull the slider, it's because the slider itself is damaged. When you use a zipper often, the slider opening will begin to stretch open a bit. Inspect both ends of the zipper to determine if they have the same opening size. If one end looks wider than the other, then this may be why your zipper failed.Tip: This is a common problem on bags and purses, as their zippers get a lot of wear and tear. As the opening increases in size, it puts less pressure on the tracts of the zipper, allowing them to stay separated."

In some cases, bent teeth on a zipper will cause a zipper to separate. If the zipper teeth are metal, you can use a pair of pliers to straighten them out. If the teeth are plastic, gently try to straighten them with your fingers, as pliers could easily break them off."

On one end of the slider there is a middle piece that won't let you squeeze it. On the other end there is no middle piece. That is the side that gets opened and needs to be squeezed back together. Don't squeeze the slider too strongly though, as you don't want to make the gap smaller than it should be. You will know the gap is too small if it becomes difficult to pull up and down the zipper slider along the tracks."

If you can see the stops at the top of the zipper and they are metal, taking off the slider and realigning the zipper is possible. The stops at the top of the zipper are small pieces of metal that are shaped a bit differently from the teeth on the zipper. They are not big pieces and they look similar to teeth but they are slightly larger and are positioned at the very end of each side of teeth. If the stops are plastic, you won't be able to take them off and put them back off without breaking them, so you can't use this method."

It's important to be gentle with the stop and don't cut it or bend it until it breaks. You need to keep it intact. Keep the top stops and put them somewhere safe, as you'll need to use them again."
