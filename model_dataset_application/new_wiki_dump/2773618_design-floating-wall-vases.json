  "text":" Preparation Identify a workspace that will allow you to both drill through the vase and paint the nails. You may need to lay down newsprint to protect surfaces. Measure the vase to identify a logical place for the hole. The hole needs to be high up enough so you can fill the vase with water, but still ensure the stability of the vase. Measure both the vase\u2019s height and width. From those measurements, identify a central spot for the hole and mark it with your permanent marker. Drilling the Vase Insert the diamond drill bit into the drill. Begin to slowly drill the hole. Drill slowly to avoid cracking the glass. Spray a small amount of water into the drilled area. Brush the dampened drilled glass dust away with a paper towel. Continue drilling until you have completed the hole. Spray the area again with water and wipe away dampened glass dust with a paper towel. Hanging the Vase Paint the nails you plan to use to hang the vase. In order to achieve that \u201cfloating\u201d look, you can cover the nails with the same color as your walls for a more blended effect. Allow nails to fully dry before using them. Identify an area on the wall where you plan to hang the vase. If you are hanging more than one vase, use your tape measure and possibly a level to ensure a symmetrical line.
