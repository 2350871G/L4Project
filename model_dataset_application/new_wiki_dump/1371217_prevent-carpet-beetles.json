Doing this and annually cleaning with steam will prevent larvae from being able to live, grow and eat because it removes their food sources: lint, hair, and dead insects. You can either hire a professional to clean your carpets or you can steam them yourself."

          "headline":"Wash potentially infested clothes and other fabrics with hot, soapy water.",
          "description":"Any trace of adult carpet beetles, larvae, and eggs can be removed with a good washing. Carpet beetles won\u2019t have time to sustain life on your clothing if you stay on top of washing them. Wash and air out clothes immediately after they\u2019re removed from storage. Don\u2019t wait to do this until after you wear the clothes or hang them in your closet because this will allow any present beetles to find a new area to thrive in. Each month, make sure that any clothes kept in your closet or dresser that you haven\u2019t worn and washed get a good warm wash and air dry too."

Once or twice a year, spray down your trash cans inside and out with a mixture of 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of bleach and 24 fluid ounces (709.8 ml) of water, rinse the cans thoroughly with a hose, and wipe them dry with a hand towel or paper towel."

Chemical insecticides may be harmful to other animals, so if you have any pets make sure to secure them in a location away from where the insecticide is sprayed or dusted. Spread boric acid all over your carpet and upholstered furniture, and make sure to vacuum it up within two hours of laying it down. While it is lethal for beetles, boric acid isn\u2019t powerful enough to harm humans. Dehydrate carpet beetles with diatomaceous earth. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth on pet beds and in the back of cabinets and closets. It\u2019s safe for pets and humans, but you\u2019ll need to wear a respirator or mask while applying to keep yourself from inhaling the particles.
