  "text":" Steps Collect your raw materials before you begin construction (see the Things You'll Need list below).  Strip the labels off two steel cans. Remove the top and bottom of each with a can opener, and save the can bottoms for a later step. Firebox Assembly Using a permanent marker, make two marks on opposite sides of the bottom rim of one can. Extend these up to about a little more than an inch from the top of the can and across to form a rectangle. Using your tin cutters (very strong scissors might work here) cut out the rectangular area you marked in the previous step. Use tape to cover the freshly cut edges or smooth them with a metal file to prevent injury. Gently bend the bottom of the cut area out to form a wider opening. Save the cut-out piece for a later step. Cut around the inner edge of the sardine tin so you have a small metal tray. (See diagram) Make two cuts on one of the longer sides of the sardine tin from the top to the bottom of the tin, and fold this panel out to form an extension of the bottom of the tin. (See diagram) Make a mark in the middle of the other side of the tin, between a quarter and a half inch up from the bottom. Using a drill bit just larger than the rivets you plan to use, drill a hole in the tin at this mark. (See diagram) Place the cut out and widened steel can in the sardine tin with the back of the can up against the side where you drilled the hole. Line up and straighten the can to your liking so that the opening of the can faces the folded-out side of the sardine tin and there is a small gap between the can and sardine tin on either side. Push the marker through the hole in the sardine tin and mark the can. Remove the can from the sardine tin, clamp it down, and drill a hole of the same diameter as before. Put the can back in the sardine tin, line up the holes, and push the rivet through. Double check how they line up before riveting the two together. Damper Assembly On the second can, make two marks on the opposite sides of the can a little more than one inch from the top. Clamp the can to a table or other solid platform and drill holes slightly larger in diameter than the steel wire you will use where you made your marks. Insert the steel wire through one hole and thread it out the other. On the free end, bend about one half inch at a 90 degree angle so the wire doesn't pull back out. On the end attached to the spool, cut it about 3 inches (7.6 cm) and bend the same direction at a 90 degree angle as the other side. The bent steel wire ends must be pretty close to parallel with the damper inside to allow better control when operating the fireplace. Take one of the cut out can bottoms from earlier and cut two slivers off of it, forming a more oblong shape. This will be the damper plate. Drop it in the bottom of the can with the steel wire. Using the rectangular cutout from Firebox Assembly Step 2 as a support, maneuver the damper plate until it is held up against the steel wire from beneath. The long dimension on the damper plate should be parallel to the steel wire (small adjustments can be made in the next step). The bent steel wire ends must be pretty close to parallel with the damper inside to allow better control when operating the fireplace. Mix up some high-temperature epoxy (about two peas' worth). Using a toothpick as a spreader, generously apply it so that it covers the steel wire and sticks to the can bottom piece. Now is the time to make sure the can bottom piece is aligned parallel to the steel wire. Leave the epoxy to cure overnight or for at least six hours. Once the epoxy is cured, place the can with the steel wire (the damper segment) on top of the cut-out can with the sardine tin (the firebox segment). Test the damper by moving the longer side of the steel wire with your finger. If it snags, wiggle the it a bit to get it moving. If it swings freely, proceed to the next step. If it catches a lot, check inside to see where it catches; you may need to bend that area to get a smoother fit. Align the damper segment so that the longer part of the steel wire points the same direction as the firebox opening. Make a small mark at the junction to allow you to easily align it again. Remove the damper segment and squeeze a very generous ribbon of the high-temp silicone sealant around the top of the firebox segment. Place the damper segment back on the firebox segment and align it using your mark. Use a toothpick to spread the silicone sealant to fill any gaps. Straighten the damper segment to line up with the firebox segment and allow the sealant to cure as stated on the instructions.  Fire Grate Assembly While the sealant cures, bend some steel wire into a little frame about 3/4 of an inch high (see picture).  Bend another length of steel wire in a tight back and forth S-shape wide enough to form a grate over the frame. Make sure there is no more than a quarter inch gap between the bars of the grate or burning fuel will fall through prematurely. Damper Controls Assembly Bend the long side of the steel wire on the damper segment into a U-turn so that the backwards-facing part is twice as long as the forward facing part (see picture). Place a small nut at the bend, and use a twist-tie to hold it in place. Test the damper; the weight of the nut should make it rotate open. If the damper catches when rotating, you will want to use it on the side with the least snags and resistance when operating the fireplace. Make a small loop at the end of the damper wire, and tie some thin string to it. Make another length of steel wire into a little pulley loop that is anchored beneath the brick or concrete block base. Create a similar assembly with a bigger, flatter loop to hold a clothespin. (See picture) Run the thin string down through the loop attached to the brick. Cut the string so that there is about two inches extra beyond the clothespin. Test your damper; it should rotate from open to closed to open again when you pull the string. Practice opening and closing it, using the clothespin to clamp the string and hold it in position. Chimney Construction and Final Assembly Remove labels, tops, and bottoms from three more steel cans.  Stack these cans on top of the damper and firebox to form the remainder of the chimney. (More cans may be used, but too many makes the fireplace top-heavy and unstable.) Position the fireplace, wire loop pulley, and the clothespin so that the damper string can move freely.  Finally, bend steel wire into two little pokers to adjust the fire with. Do not skip this step! Preparing the Fuel Cut open the package of the manufactured fire log. Using a plastic knife, shave off some of the log. Smush the shavings into marble-sized pellets, then elongate them slightly so they do not roll as easily. Rubber gloves are optional here; the material is non-toxic, but smells gross and sticks to your hands. Repeat until you have a good supply of pellets. Ten will last a while, and more can be made later when the fire is going. Operating Your Fireplace Place one pellet on the grate towards the back of the firebox (but not touching the wall).  Open the damper all of the way. The steel wire ends show the angle the damper is pointing, they should be vertical. If you're not sure, look down the chimney to see what's happening inside. Light the pellet with a lighter or match. It might take a little while to catch, depending on the type of fire log you bought. Once the pellet has been fully engulfed for a minute, carefully add a second pellet. This is easiest to place on the edge of the grate and slide it in with the pokers until it touches the first pellet. The second pellet will catch from the first; when you see the first stop flaming and become a little ember, you can push the second pellet further in. The pellets make very little ash, and the glowing remains will slowly burn down and fall through into the bottom of the sardine tin. Add a third pellet two or three minutes after the second, but sooner if the flames seem to by dying down. This will take practice to  determine when is best to add the next pellet. After the third pellet is burning well, slowly close the damper to about halfway and watch the reaction. If you see the flame and smoke start to come out the front of the firebox, open the damper some until this stops. The most efficient operation is when the smoke all goes up the chimney, but is restricted enough to slow down and heat the cans, causing them to radiate the heat out. Every fireplace will be different, so you will need to experiment with how to best work the damper. When you choose to stop feeding your fire, the last pellet will burn itself out into a glowing ember. There will be a little smoke when this happens, but not as much as normal wood would produce. Let the fire go out completely and allow the fireplace to cool before moving or disassembling the chimney.",
