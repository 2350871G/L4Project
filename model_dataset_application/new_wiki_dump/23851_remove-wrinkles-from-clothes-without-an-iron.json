          "description":"Tumble drying clothing is a great way to remove wrinkles. Put the setting on medium, and dry the clothing for about 15 minutes. Hang the clothes up right after removing them from the dryer so that wrinkles don't come back. Or wear them right away. If you leave the clothes in the dryer for a long time after the cycle ends or toss them into a clothes basket, the wrinkles will probably return. Put a couple ice cubes into the dryer or mist the clothing with water before drying them. The ice cubes will melt, and turn into steam, which will help remove the wrinkles from the clothing. Or you could put a damp sock into the dryer with the wrinkled clothing."

Then, hang the clothes on the rod itself or on a hanger you put on the rod.Seal the room: Seal the bathroom (the smaller the better) for air leaks -- shut windows, block the space under the door.Close but still dry: Get the clothes as close to the heat and water as you can without getting them wet. Direct the shower head away from the clothing to divert the stream. It's not good enough to just hang the clothes in the bathroom a distance from the shower head \u2014 get them as close as you can!Give it time: It takes about 15 minutes of steam to get rid of wrinkles.

You can also make homemade sprays.Using Wrinkle ReleaserMaking your own: Mix 1  c (240 mL) of water and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of fabric softener in a spray bottle. Shake the bottle thoroughly, and test it on a small piece of the fabric to make sure that it won't discolor or stain it. If it looks fine, generously spray the garment while gently pulling it taut to remove the wrinkles. Spray the clothing until it's damp, but not so much that it is soaked in the mixture.Let it dry: After spraying your clothing, hang it out until it's completely dry. Hang whites outside in the sun to make them brighter, but don't hang colored clothes in the sun. This can bleach them.Use it in a pinch: When you're on-the-go and ironing isn't possible, keep a small spray bottle of this in your desk at work or in the car."

The downside of this approach is that you have to be careful not to burn yourself, as well as the clothing. And the heat will be inconsistent because the pot could cool fast and is a circular shape.

          "description":"Usually, flat irons are used for curling your hair. However, you could also use the device to iron at least a small section of clothing. A flat iron works really well for reaching areas that are very hard to iron, such as a shirt collar. It's also useful that the iron clamps down on the clothing, meaning it will apply more direct heat than another method, such as a blow dryer. Make sure that you clean the iron first. If you leave hair products on it, like hairspray, they could mar your clothes. Be aware that the products could transfer from your hair onto the iron with each use. You could burn your shirt if you press the flat iron onto the clothing for too long, so be careful. You should not use a curling iron with a round barrel for this."
