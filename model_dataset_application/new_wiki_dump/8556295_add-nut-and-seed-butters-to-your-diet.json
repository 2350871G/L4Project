        {
          "headline":"Select high-quality peanut butter.",
          "description":"You may be overwhelmed when selecting a peanut butter, since there are so many options. Read the ingredient label and avoid peanut butters that have added oils (especially hydrogenated oils) and sugars. Try to buy a natural peanut butter that just contains peanuts (and possibly salt). Peanut butter is a great source of protein. Hydrogenated oils contain trans fats which can be harmful to your heart."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Start using almond butter.",
          "description":"Even if your grocery store has a limited selection of nut and seed butters, you'll probably find almond butter. Almond butter has a mellow and slightly sweet flavor. It's easy to stir into dressings, sauces, and baked goods. Since some brands will add honey or other sweeteners, it's important to read the label. Almond butter contains vitamin E, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorous, and iron."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try cashew butter.",
          "description":"If you want a rich tasting nut butter that's a little sweet and buttery, use cashew butter. The natural sweetness makes it a great addition to fruit smoothies. You can easily replace peanut butter or even heavy cream with cashew butter in baked good recipes. It's also great in curries or savory dishes. Cashew butter is a good source of copper, manganese, and magnesium."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pick up a soy nut butter.",
          "description":"Soy nut butter is often sold as a peanut butter substitute which is useful if you or someone in your home has a peanut allergy. It has the same texture as peanut butter and a similar flavor, but it has less fat than peanut butter. Since it has a mild flavor, you can easily add it to meals or baked goods. Soy nut butter is high in protein, omega-3s, protein, and amino acids."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Consider using sunflower seed butter.",
          "description":"Sunflower seed butter is a little thinner than peanut butter and distinctly tastes like sunflower seeds, so you may need to plan on how you incorporate it in your food. For example, sunflower seed works well in savory recipes that call for tahini. You could also add it to vegetables or sauces. Sunflower seed butter is a little higher in fat than peanut butter, but it contains more vitamin E, iron, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Eat pumpkin seed butter in the fall.",
          "description":"As the seasons change, many people enjoy adding seasonal dishes to their menu. Pumpkin seed butter is a great addition to your diet and helps you enjoy the tastes of the season. If you can't find it in the store, you can easily make it at home by mashing up some pumpkin seeds. They taste best mixed with almonds or walnuts. Pumpkin seed butter is very high in zinc."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try walnut butter.",
          "description":"Walnut butter can help you reach your Omega-3 goals through your diet. It's also packed with other nutrients. If you like dense, earthy flavors or are looking for something to balance a sweet bread, roll, or fruit, walnut butter can be a great option."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Start using tahini.",
          "description":"Tahini is made by grinding toasted sesame seeds into a thin butter. This makes it a good choice for stirring into sauces, dressings, or glazes. Traditionally, tahini is an important ingredient in hummus, the Middle Eastern garbanzo bean spread. Tahini contains unsaturated fat and lignans that have been shown to lower cholesterol. It's also a good source of iron and magnesium."

          "description":"Peanut butter and jelly is a classic combination for a reason, but if you need a change, substitute a different butter. This one change will make a big difference in the flavor of your sandwich. For an even more unusual sandwich, try one of these combinations:\nAlmond butter and sour cherry preserves\nSunflower seed butter and sliced bananas\nCashew butter and fig jam\nPecan butter and apple butter\nSoybean butter and sliced apples"

          "description":"Mix up a savory nut and seed butter dip by combining the butter with cream cheese and a little seasoning (like taco seasoning or harissa). Dip carrot sticks, celery sticks, or crackers into the dip. Or make a sweet dip for fruit. Combine nut or seed butter with honey and a little vanilla or cinnamon. You can even replace traditional frostings with the sweetened butter dip, since it will still be quite thick."

          "headline":"Stir nut and seed butter into porridge or oatmeal.",
          "description":"Hot breakfast cereals are known for being filling, but they don't usually have much protein. Add protein and nutrients by stirring a few tablespoons of your favorite nut or seed butter into your hot porridge or oatmeal. Consider using one of these combinations:\nAlmond butter and pumpkin\nSunflower seed butter and berries\nCashew butter and bananas"

        {
          "headline":"Whisk nut and seed butter into dressings or sauces.",
          "description":"If you're unsure how to add tahini to your diet, just whisk it into a salad dressing or sauce. You can make a simple starter dressing by combining tahini, water (or lemon juice) and salt. Whisk in your favorite flavorings or thickeners to make a sauce. Try adding:\nCumin\nTurmeric\nSoy sauce\nHoney\nOlive oil\nGarlic\nGinger"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Bake cookies with your favorite nut or seed butter.",
          "description":"Peanut butter cookies are a classic way to get peanut butter in your diet, but you could use any nut or seed butter. Try adding a few tablespoons of nut or seed butter to oatmeal cookies, pecan tea cakes, classic chocolate chip cookies, or no-bake chocolate oatmeal cookies. Because cookies are high in fat and sugar, they should be a limited part of a balanced diet. For a really quick gluten-free cookie, mix together sunflower butter with sugar and an egg. Roll the cookies into balls and flatten them a little. Bake them as you would peanut butter cookies."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Mix up protein balls or nut bars.",
          "description":"Most granola bars rely on oats, eggs, and sugar for binding together. To make your own nut bars, combine nuts with dates and your choice of nut or seed butter. You could also make smaller protein balls by just mixing together protein powder with maple syrup and nut or seed butter. The protein balls are much smoother than the nut bars. Stir in your favorite dried fruit to the nut bars or even add flaked coconut."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Blend nut or seed butter into a smoothie.",
          "description":"If you enjoy drinking smoothies for breakfast but find that they don't fill you up for long, add nut or seed butter. Add your favorite nut or seed butter to your usual smoothie and blend it until the butter is incorporated. The protein in the butter will help to keep you feeling fuller longer. Some good combinations to try include:\nCherry and almond butter\nAlmond butter and matcha\nChocolate peanut butter and banana\nCashew butter and blueberries\nSunflower seed butter with chocolate and raspberries"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Toss nut or seed butter with noodles.",
          "description":"Create an Asian-inspired noodle dish by cooking a pot of soba, udon, or rice noodles. Drain the noodles and toss them with your choice of nut or seed butter. It's a great way to create a healthy and filling sauce. You can also stir in lots of fresh vegetables for crunch. For example, toss soba noodles with a spicy nut or seed butter sauce. Stir in slices of bell peppers and garnish the noodles with cilantro and peanuts."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Replace cream in recipes with cashew butter.",
          "description":"If you're vegan and want to leave out the cream in a soup or chocolate ganache recipe, you can replace it with some cashew butter. To get a thinner consistency, put cashew butter into a blender or food processor along with enough water to cover the cashew butter. Pulse the blender until the water is incorporated and the butter is thin enough to pour. This substitution works best in recipes where the cream needs to be heated. Avoid trying to use cashew butter in recipes that call for cold cream to be whipped."
