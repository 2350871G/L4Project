Simply disconnect the hose from the faucet to reduce the likelihood of this occurring in your home. To disconnect the hose, turn it to the left or counter-clockwise.

This method should only be used to turn off the faucet before winter and should not be followed during the winter. Every house tends to have the interior valve located in a different place. Typically, you can find the interior valve in 1 of 3 places, depending on the design of your home:\nBasement: The valve is normally situated near the front foundation wall.

Some valves have round wheel handles which you can close by turning them clockwise or to the right. Other valves have level handles which you can close by using \u00bc turns until the handle is no longer parallel to the pipe. Try and open faucets around the home after you\u2019ve closed the main valve to check if you've successfully shut down the water supply. Open the faucet on the highest level of the home to relieve pressure. Open the outside faucet until it runs dry. Keep an eye on the outside faucet for a while after you\u2019ve opened it. When water completely stops dripping from the faucet, it is fully drained. Turn off the exterior faucet. In doing this, you will ensure that the exterior faucet has no dormant water sitting inside the sillcock or hose bib. You should double-check after to make sure that the outside faucet is not dripping any water. Open the shut-off valve again. Now that your faucet is drained and is dry, you can open the shut-off valve again to restore water to the home. Make sure you turn off the exterior faucet and close the drain cap before doing this. Simply turn the valve the opposite direction from when you closed it to re-open it. Insulating the Faucet Wrap exposed pipes with insulation tubes. You can buy insulation tubes at your local hardware store. The tubes come with an opening slit along one side. Open this slit and place insulation tubes around all of your outside pipes. For extra protection, use duct tape to keep the slit tightly shut and to better protect the pipes from damage. Get an old piece of clothing or a towel. You can use any old piece of clothing like an old t-shirt or jumper that you no longer wear. Towels will work best but clothing items like t-shirts or jumpers will also do. Wrap your chosen fabric around the faucet. You might need to fold the t-shirt or jumper to make them sufficiently thick to keep the faucet protected. Make sure that you cover the entire faucet with the garment and wrap it around it as many times as you can and as tightly as possible. You can use another clothing item for extra safety. Simply wrap it around the first item. Check to make sure you've covered the whole faucet. Place a plastic bag over the fabric and faucet. Use a bag that will tightly fit around the fabric and faucet. Push the bag all the way into the wall to adequately protect your faucet from damage from all areas. Use a zip tie to seal the opening of the bag at the wall. Tape the bag. Use duct tape to tightly wrap and seal the plastic bag over the clothing. When finished, the tape should completely cover the bag. Test the security of the insulation by lightly pulling on the tape. If the bag and the garments come off after a light pull, you\u2019ll need to start again and wrap them tighter.",
