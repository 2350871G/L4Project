If you don\u2019t clean the surface, your paint job won\u2019t be as effective as you want it to be. In the end, you might create textures you don\u2019t want to create. Clean by:\nRemoving any dust, pet hair, or other grime from the surface. For example, take a vacuum or shop-vac and vacuum up spider webs or dirt. Using a damp rag to wipe down the wall before you paint it. Making sure to use soap or vinegar to remove any substantial dirty or scum from the wall."

Fortunately, you won\u2019t have to spend too much time fixing the hole because your textured paint will hide imperfections. Either cut a new piece of drywall or use spackle to fill the hole. Use joint compound to smooth over the patch. Apply a second coat of compound, if you want. Either smooth over or leave the compound or spackle textured."

This is perhaps one of your most important decisions, as its perhaps the simplest way to add texture to your paint job. Decide what you want to use and:\nPick a roller with the type of texture you want. You can choose a smooth roller and apply your own texture after painting or you could pick a textured roller. Use a brush to paint your wall. The brush will leave a light texture and you can go back later and add more. Spray your paint on and apply more texture later."

However, it should be able to hide a lot of minor flaws like dents, chips, nail holes, and more. Start by priming the wall and picking your favorite textured paint. Paint an entire wall quickly. This is important, as texture paint dries relatively fast. If one area dries before you\u2019ve finished the wall, lines may appear where the paint dried first. Use a regular roller, brush, or a sprayer if you\u2019re painting a large area. Use extra paint on a flawed area, to fill it in or obscure it. Apply two coats of your texture paint."

To get around this, you can purchase texture additive and combine it with your paint before applying it. In the end, you'll find that chips, nail holes, and other mild or moderate flaws will be obscured. Pick your paint color and:\nPour your paint into a mixing container. Add about half a cup of additive to your paint at a time. Mix the additive in and then add more additive. Prime the wall. Paint the wall. Use extra paint around a wall flaw.

Wash your brushes so there is no dirt or other debris attached to them. Take your brushes and brush texture in all over your wet paint. Leave enough brush marks so the wall damage blends with your newly created texture. If you need more paint, feel free to use it. Try to complete one small section of wall at a time. For example, paint and texture one 8 foot (2.44 meter) by 10 foot (3 meter) section before moving on to another."

Make sure your sponges are clean and don\u2019t have any dirt or other debris attached. Repeat your dabbing over the entire surface of the wall. Create any pattern you want.

Thus, faux painting offers a unique opportunity to use large and small wall flaws to enhance your larger paint scheme. Paint a color lightly over a bright base coat, like a white. Take a cloth and wipe down the wall unevenly. In addition, take a brush and brush some uneven lines into the paint. Do this so it mimics any pre-existing wall flaws. That way, wall flaws will seem like they're just part of the faux paint job. To add more texture, use a sponge with a darker shade and dab over the wall flaw. For example, if you\u2019re main wall color is a cream color, use a slightly darker cream color to accent wall flaws and other textured areas. If you need to repair the wall, don\u2019t spend a lot of effort smoothly out your putty work."
