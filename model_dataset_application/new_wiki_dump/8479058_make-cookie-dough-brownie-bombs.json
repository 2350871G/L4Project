  "text":" Making the Cookie Dough Balls Cream the butter and sugar. In a medium-sized bowl, beat the two ingredients together with an electric mixer. Mix until the ingredients are light and fluffy, taking about 2-3 minutes. Pour in the vanilla extract and milk. Mix once more until well-combined. Fold in the flour and salt. Stir slowly on a low speed. The dough will begin to form and get stiff. Add a cup of chocolate chips to the dough. Mix one last time until fully mixed. The cookie dough should have no flour streaks and should be combined together properly. #Cover a baking tray with foil or parchment paper. Scoop the cookie dough onto the baking sheet. Using a mini ice cream scoop, scoop balls of dough onto the sheet. Leave two inches between each one. Keep the balls medium-sized. Don't make them too big or they'll be harder to handle, but don't make them too small, either. Freeze the cookie dough balls for about an hour. This helps firm the cookie dough and makes it easier when it's time to make the chocolate bombs. Forming the Balls and Serving Place parchment or waxed paper on a baking tray.  Make the brownie squares. Cut the brownies into 1-inch sized squares, making them small. Flatten them out with your hands. Cover the cookie dough balls with the flattened brownies. Wrap each brownie piece around each ball, carefully covering each one until completely wrapped. If the brownie cracks slightly, roll it around with your fingers to help surround the truffles. Melt the chocolate bark in a microwave. Place it in a microwave-safe bowl and heat until fully melted, taking about 2-3 minutes and stirring frequently. Dunk the balls in the melted chocolate. Use a fork to place the balls the bowl and cover them completely. Gently tap on them to remove any excess chocolate. Place the cookie dough bombs on the tray. Garnish them with the mini chocolate chips. Chill the cookie dough bombs in the fridge. Allow them to chill until the chocolate hardens, taking about 30 minutes to an hour. Serve.
