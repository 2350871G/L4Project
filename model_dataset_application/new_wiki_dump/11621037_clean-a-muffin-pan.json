Then, lay 1 or 2 dryer sheets flat in the water on top of the muffin pan holes.

This will give the cleaning additives in the dryer sheets more time to dissolve and loosen a lot of grease. If you need to use them sooner or want to get them clean quickly, however, let them soak for at least 1 hour."

If there is any remaining mess after you let the pan soak, however, you can use a spatula to scrap off caked-on food, and use a sponge to wipe away any grease. After wiping off any remaining grime, you may want to rinse your muffin pan one last time with dish soap and warm water to remove any chemical residue from the dryer sheets."
