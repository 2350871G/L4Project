  "text":" Red Snapper Ceviche Debone 2 lbs. of fresh red snapper fillets. To remove the bones from the fillets, simply run a knife along the snapper and cut off the hard white bones. Cut the fillets into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) strips.  Place the fillets and marinade ingredients in a non-reactive casserole dish. Place the fillets, 1/2 finely diced onion, 1 cup of chopped tomatoes, 1 finely diced and seeded serrano chili, 2 tsp. of salt, one pinch of cayenne pepper, and one dash of ground oregano in either a Pyrex or ceramic fish. Pour 1/2 cup of fresh-squeezed lime juice and 1/2 cup of fresh-squeezed lemon juice over the mixture. Don't stir. Cover the dish.  Refrigerate the dish for one hour.  Remove the fish from the refrigerator and stir. After the fish has soaked in the juices, you should stir the fish and ingredients carefully, so they're evenly distributed over the fish. Return the dish to the refrigerator. Let it sit for a few more hours. This will give the flavors enough time to blend and to fill the fish with a tangy, refreshing flavor. As the fish absorbs the flavor, its color will change from a pinkish gray and translucent to a whiter color. Remove the dish from the refrigerator. Sprinkle it with 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro and top with slices of 1 diced avocado. Serve. Remove the dish from the refrigerator and serve with tortilla chips. The ceviche can be enjoyed as a dip for the tortilla chips or the chips can serve as a compliment to the dish. Scallop Ceviche Rinse 1 lb. of bay scallops. Place them in a medium-sized bowl once they're rinsed. Pour lime juice over the scallops. You should juice 8 medium-sized limes to create freshly-squeezed lime juice. The scallops should be completely soaked in the juice. You can even stir them just a bit to make sure that the juice is evenly distributed. Chill the scallops overnight. Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator. You should chill the scallops until they're opaque instead of transparent. This will mean that they've absorbed the lime juice. Remove half of the lime juice from the bowl.  Add the rest of the ingredients to the mixture. Add 2 diced tomatoes, 5 minced green onions, 2 sliced celery stalks, 1/2 of a minced green bell pepper, 1/2 cup of chopped fresh parsley, 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1/8 cup of chopped fresh cilantro, and ground black pepper to taste to the scallop mixture. Stir the mixture gently until all of the ingredients are evenly distributed. Serve. Serve this tasty scallop ceviche in martini glasses and hang a slice of lime over the rim of each glass. Tilapia Ceviche Dice 2 lbs. of tilapia fillets. Dice it finely. It's easier to dice tilapia when it's partially frozen, and this is also better for its presentation. Place the tilapia in a medium bowl.  Pour 1 cup of lime juice over the tilapia. You should squeeze about 8 limes to get 1 cup of lime juice. Mix the tilapia and juice gently to combine the flavors. Cover the dish and refrigerate it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes. Remove it when the fish is white, instead of more transparent. This will mean that it has soaked up enough lime juice. Remove the fish from the refrigerator and drain the lime juice. Pour the juice out of the bowl and gently squeeze the fish with your hands (if you're wearing gloves) or press into it gently with a wooden spoon. You can discard the lime juice. Add 1/2 cup of seeded chopped tomato, 1/2 of a peeled, seeded, and diced cucumber, 1/2 cup of chopped onion, and 1/4 cup of chopped fresh cilantro to the mixture.  Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.  Add 1/2 cup of clam-tomato juice, 1 tbsp. of hot sauce, and 1 diced serrano chile to the mixture. Clamato is a popular brand of clam-tomato juice. Spread 4 tbsp. of mayonnaise over 6 tostadas. Top the mayonnaise with the ceviche.  Serve. Arrange the slices of 1 sliced avocado on top of the ceviche and serve this delicious dish with a wedge of lime. Mixed Seafood Ceviche Clean and cook 1/2 lb. of crawfish tail meat. Most crawfish tail meat is sold peeled, cooked, and ready to eat, but if it's not cooked, then you'll need to heat it over a skillet for 1-10 minutes, until the meat becomes tougher but not mealy. Peel and devein 1/2 lb. of shrimp. To peel the shrimp, just pull off the head along with the legs. Pull up from the head and remove the outer shell. To devein the shrimp, just use a small paring knife to cut along the outer edge of the shrimp's back. Cut \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) into the back, until you reach the dark greenish vein.
