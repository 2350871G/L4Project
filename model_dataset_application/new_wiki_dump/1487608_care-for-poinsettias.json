If poinsettias are exposed to low outside temperatures for even a few minutes they can chill or even freeze, causing the leaves to droop and fall off. The gardening center or store where you purchase your poinsettia should be able to provide you with some form of protective covering for your trip home.

Water the plant until you see water begin to seep through the holes at the bottom of the pot. After 10 minutes, remove any excess water from the saucer beneath the pot. If the plant is left sitting in water, the soil will become too wet and will not contain enough air, leading to root rot and other diseases. If the plant is left too long without water, the leaves will begin to droop and wilt. To prevent this, make sure that you check the soil regularly. If the leaves do begin to wilt, water the plant at once, then water it a second time five minutes later."

You can usually wait until you've had the plant for about 6 to 8 weeks before it becomes necessary to fertilize. Of course, if you don't plan on keeping the poinsettia there will be no need to fertilize. Many people find that it's easier to just buy a new plant each year, rather than caring for the same one all year round. However if you do plan on keeping your poinsettia, you should use an all-purpose, water soluble houseplant fertilizer to fertilize the plant in early January. Use according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fertilizer will held to maintain the plant's green foliage and promote new growth."
