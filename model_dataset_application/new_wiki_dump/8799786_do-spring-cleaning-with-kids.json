Little kids have short attention spans, so break down the project into smaller tasks. For example, say, \u201cWe'll be cleaning the playroom next week. First we will put your toys away, then we will vacuum the rug.\u201d"

To make it more fun and engaging, ask your younger child to decorate their list or chart. Upload a task list to your tween or teen's cell phone. Buy stickers for young children to put in the check boxes when each task is complete. Allow your child to choose the sticker as a reward. Draw pictures to represent the tasks for a toddler. You could also cut and paste pictures instead of drawing. Laminate and post the chore chart in an area where your child will see it often. Use a dry-erase marker to check off completed tasks, or let young children move Velcro images of tasks to a \u201ccompleted\u201d column."

Break the directions down into steps if possible. For example, say: \u201cTake your duster and brush it over all of the shelves in the bookcase. Next, dust with your duster on top of and around the TV.\u201d\nThe first time you teach your child to do a task, you should model it for them. Explain what you are doing and why, such as, \u201cNow I am moving the lamp so I can dust the table underneath it.\u201d\nFor more complicated chores, write down step-by-step instructions, including the tools and cleaning products needed for the job. For example, give your teen written instructions on how to clean the grout in the bathrooms, and list the scrub brushes and cleaners needed to get the job done."
