      "description":"Chocolate Lebkuchen cookies are rather round cookies. Spoon them out. These cookies will tend to puff up after baking. They have a rather solid base that does taste a bit like the unconsecrated wafer you'd taste when going up for Holy Communion (no, they aren't blessed) at a church, that holds the cookie together. (If you take a look at a store-bought one, the wafers that hold it together, traditionally are white, though the coloring doesn't matter). Leave at least an inch of space between the cookies because they'll spread out when they cook. You can usually fit 6-8 (dependent on their size that you've crafted them to be) cookies on a full-sized cookie sheet at a time."
