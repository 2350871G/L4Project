You should reflect on whether you\u2019ll go to the event as soon as you get the RSVP email. Consider the location of the event and if you\u2019ll have to travel. For example, if someone invites you to an out-of-town wedding, you may need to buy airplane tickets to get there. This could be costly. Plan to make sure you don\u2019t have any other events that time and day. Talk to your partner and other members of your family to make sure they are available. You may wind up declining for some members of your family and accepting for others."

For example, is the occasion a BBQ that your neighbor is having for no reason and sent out an informal email about? This type of event may merit an informal tone in your reply and you may have less time to respond. Is it a formal event.

Read the invitation for a \u201cRSVP by\u201d date. This date is not a suggestion. Make sure you RSVP by the date. Respond as quickly as you can. While the person who invited you may have given you a month or two to respond, this doesn\u2019t mean you should take that entire window of time. Instead, you should respond as soon as you\u2019ve made a concrete decision about whether you will attend."

For example, write \u201cRoger and Anne Decline Your Invitation for the Ball and Banquet on May 11.\u201d\nFor informal events, like your neighbor\u2019s BBQ, you can write \u201cUnable to make it to your BBQ on the 11th.\u201d"
