Conversely, if the wings are still colorful (ie red or yellow), that means the fruit is underripe and still needs more time to ripen. Once the dragon fruit has reached the stage of ripeness where the wings start to wither, the fruit should come off the vine fairly easily with a light twist. If the fruit falls off the vine on its own, it is overripe."

If it is really mushy, then the fruit is likely overripe. If it\u2019s very firm, it will need a few days to ripen. Only use this method if you are growing and harvesting your own dragon fruit. Squeezing a dragon fruit can leave the fruit bruised, which is inconsiderate to vendors and other customers in a store or market setting. You can purchase or harvest a dragon fruit that is underripe and leave it out on a counter for a few days at room temperature. It will likely ripen in a couple days. Test the ripeness daily by pressing the skin."

For example, if the fruit is not packaged properly during transportation, they may roll into each other. They might also become bruised from being dropped. If damaged the fruit will contain noticeable blemishes and will be much smaller and shriveled due to moisture loss. Check all sides of the fruit and avoid purchasing fruit that has been cracked, split open, or damaged."

          "description":"Dragon fruits, unlike many other fruits, do not ripen as much after harvest and as a result should be harvested when they are almost fully ripe. Once the color of the fruit has changed from green to yellow or red, then it is ready to harvest. The small leaves on the sides of the fruit (also known as the \u201cwings\u201d) will also start to fade or turn brown as the fruit ripens. You can also determine the ripeness by counting the days after the plant flowers. Typically the fruit is ripe a minimum of 27 to 33 days after the plant flowers. Proper time of harvesting is four days after the color of the fruit changes. For export purpose, however, it is important to harvest slightly sooner, a day after the color changes."
