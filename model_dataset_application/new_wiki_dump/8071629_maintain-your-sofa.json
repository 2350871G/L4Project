You should vacuum your sofa at least once a week when you're doing your regular chores. This will keep the sofa free of dirt and debris that can cause damage over time. This will also help control air quality in the room where you keep your sofa. If dirt and debris settle onto a sofa, they can affect the integrity of the surrounding air. Vacuum the surface of the sofa. You should also vacuum in any nooks and crannies. If you can remove the cushions, remove them and vacuum underneath. You should also vacuum the floor surrounding the sofa and under the sofa. Push the sofa forward or backward at least once a week and vacuum underneath."

Use blotting motions to remove the liquid. If you catch a spill quick enough, you can remove it before it leaves a mark on your sofa. If you don't get everything out with a dry cloth, use a water-based cleaner to rub out the remaining stain. However, do not attempt to treat a grease or oil stain yourself.

In addition to regularly vacuuming and lint rolling, you need to wipe down a leather sofa with a cleaning solution. Many people make their own cleaning solution for leather furniture by mixing equal parts water and white vinegar. However, you can also buy a commercial leather cleaner at a hardware or department store. Whichever cleaner you use, test it on a small portion of your leather sofa before applying to the whole surface. Coat a soft cloth in the solution until it's damp, but not dripping wet. Wipe down the full surface of the sofa. When you are done, gently dry the surface with a dry rag."
