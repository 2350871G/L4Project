An eight-ounce lobster tail is normally enough for a single adult. Lobster tails can easily be purchased at most supermarkets, seafood markets and online. Be sure to check the tails' expiration date. Don\u2019t purchase a lobster tail past the expiration date. In general, cold-water lobster tails are better to work with than warm-water lobster tails.
