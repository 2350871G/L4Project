          "description":"Before replacing your lawn with groundcovers, make sure your new plants can handle some foot traffic. If the space needs to be durable enough for rougher activities, like your children or pets playing, a hard packed area might be your best bet. Pacific beach strawberry, for instance, is a hardy perennial groundcover native across nearly the entire North American Pacific coast. It\u2019ll tolerate being walked on, but isn\u2019t great for recreational activities. If you need spots for heavy foot traffic or outdoor playing, consider utilizing border edging and putting weed fabric underneath permeable hardscapes, such as decomposed granite, mulch, or gravel."

          "headline":"Go with plants suitable for your light exposure and climate.",
          "description":"Observe your yard over the course of the day, and note which areas receive the most sun and which remain shaded. Choose plants that are marked best for full sun, partial sun, or shade for the appropriate areas. For example, Moss phlox loves sunlight and, as a bonus, produces flowers that attract butterflies. For shaded areas, consider a vine or ivy native to your location, like Virginia creeper, which is native from Quebec and Ontario to Central America. Keep in mind that some types of vines and ivies are very aggressive in growth, and can spread quickly up and into trees or onto buildings. Your local home improvement store or nursery will carry groundcovers with various light preferences that thrive in your climate. If you have any questions, ask them about the best perennial choices for your sunlight exposure and hardiness zone. You can also,  if applicable, refer to the Sunset Western Garden book or your State Landscape and Nursery Association for suggestions."

For example, Creeping Jenny and English Ivy are both considered invasive in locations across the eastern United States. They might grow quickly and provide quick coverage, but they\u2019ll push out your other groundcover choices and change your native soil\u2019s chemistry."

Add any needed amendments to the soil for tilling so that it can be incorporated into planting beds. Improve its quality by mixing in a layer of peat moss. Use a shovel to spread 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of peat moss across the planting area. Then use the roto-tiller to blend it with the existing soil."

A typical distance will be between six and ten inches, but you can modify your interval based on your budget and expectations. If you want to keep cost low, purchase fewer plants and increase the distance between seedlings. For instant coverage, a 15 by 20 foot space (4.6 by 6 meters) requires about 300 plants planted only a few inches apart. If you can wait a year or two, you can use a fraction of that number, plant seedlings ten to twelve inches apart, and wait for them to develop coverage. Often, bedding plants are spaced for planting in a triangular pattern for faster fill in. You can make your own spacing tools with PVC pipe or lumber. Use marking paint, highly visible tape, or permanent marker to mark the measured distance of desired planting."
