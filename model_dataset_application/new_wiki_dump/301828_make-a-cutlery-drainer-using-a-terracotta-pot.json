The cutlery has plenty of room to drain and even air dry if you don't feel like drying up straight away. If you can't place the pot on the sink, place it on a non-porous saucer, so as not to spoil the surface it is sitting on. However, you'll need to empty the water from it after each drying session, to avoid spills."
