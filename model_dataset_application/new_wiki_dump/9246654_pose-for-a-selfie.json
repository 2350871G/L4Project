Most people prefer one side of their face to the other, so tilt that side toward your camera to take a good selfie. Swivel each of your shoulders away from the camera one at a time to help figure out your best angle."

          "description":"Gently angle your chin downwards, towards the floor. Holding your chin slightly down and the camera slightly up shows the harmonious flow of the cheekbones toward the lips. This angle may work best if your forehead is on the shorter side."

If you aren't really there but you want a smiley selfie, relax and let a good feeling come to you. Take a deep breath and let it out. Think of someone who makes you happy, and imagine smiling at them. Let your eyes crinkle up slightly when you smile, but don't force it by squinting."

Smiling and making eye contact will help you look friendly and inviting. For a coy look, try casting your eyes downward and to the side. Widen your eyes and raise your eyebrows slightly to look alert, innocent, or surprised."

For a cute puppy look, try sticking out your lower lip while tilting your chin down and looking right into the camera. Relaxing your face so that your expression is blank can be flattering, but your photo won't be as interesting."

If you have two mirrors facing one another, you can even take a picture of your back and front at once. Mirror shots look best if the light is next to the mirror, rather than behind you. Try putting a lamp next to your mirror, or keep a mirror by your window. Try shooting from right next to your face or closer to your chest. If you don't want the camera to show, hold it just past the mirror frame."

Fluorescent lights are generally not the most flattering, while soft and golden light gives you a much better selfie. Posing outside, or near a window, can provide great lighting for selfies. When taking a photo in direct sunlight, try blocking the sun with your head. That way, you won't squint, and the sun will light your hair up like a halo. Photographers call the time around sunrise and sunset the \"golden hour,\" when the light is warm and soft. Strong candle-light can also be attractive, but be careful when lighting your face from below. Tilt your chin down so the light can catch your cheekbones. Nice restaurants, caf\u00e9s, galleries, and changing rooms in high-end stores often have flattering lighting."

Hold a napkin, a piece of paper, or some other white object just within the frame of your selfie. Crop it out when you've taken the shot.
