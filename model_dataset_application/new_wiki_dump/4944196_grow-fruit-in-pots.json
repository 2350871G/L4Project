Dwarf apple, orange and peach trees can also be grown in containers, as well as blueberry and raspberry bushes. Some hybrids and cultivars of fruit trees and bushes are self-pollinating but, for best results, you should grow two fruit trees or bushes that are pollen-compatible. The greenhouse or nursery should be able to help you select compatible trees and bushes."

Check the containers every morning and evening. Water the fruit plant, tree or bush when the top inch or two of soil becomes dry and apply the water until it drains from the bottom of the container. Watering plants with spoiled milk is a good way to both stave off powdery mildew and add some nutrients to the soil at the same time."

Follow the fertilizer manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for dilution instructions and application frequency. Always water first then apply the diluted fertilizer. Do not apply fertilizer after mid- to late summer to avoid new, tender leaf growth coming into the winter months."

A garage where the temperatures do not drop much below freezing is fine or, where winter temperatures tend to get very cold, a basement or cool room in the house works well. Over the winter, you should water the plants lightly when the soil becomes dry."
