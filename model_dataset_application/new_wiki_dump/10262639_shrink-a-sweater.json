Time it for 10 minutes and check on it every few minutes. You can put the sweater in a pillowcase to prevent the fibers from snagging in the machine.

If you were checking on it regularly, it shouldn\u2019t have gotten too small. Putting it in the dryer for 25 minutes with other garments will shrink the sweater down 1 size.
