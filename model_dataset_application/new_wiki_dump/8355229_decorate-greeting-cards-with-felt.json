          "description":"If you decide to add felt to your greeting card and venture off to a craft store, you\u2019ll notice there are several different kinds of felt. These are good for a variety of different purposes, so choose the kind that will work best for the craft you want to create. You certainly don\u2019t need to buy any special felt, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to have a few types of felt in your craft drawer. Ordinary acrylic felt is the most common felt you will find \u2013 you\u2019re probably familiar with this type of felt. It\u2019s cheap and works great for creating shapes and designs and gluing them to your paper. Stiffened felt is a sturdier, more rigid type of felt. If you want to create your entire card from felt, the stiffened felt can work as the background. It can also be used to create three-dimensional forms on your card, because it holds its shape. Shapes and felt with adhesive backings make crafting easier. You can purchase pre-cut shapes to save you from having to cut your felt, and felt with an adhesive backing doesn\u2019t require any glue."

          "description":"Luckily, you don\u2019t need any special tools or fabric scissors to cut felt. Your regular scissors will work fine. Use a pencil to mark or trace what you want to cut, and use your crafting scissors to cut it out. If you are working with stiffened felt or very thick felt and want to create a perfectly straight border, you can use a straight edge and an X-Acto knife to create it. Place your straight edge where you want your border to be. Then, drag the X-Acto knife along the felt (against edge of the straight edge) until you\u2019ve cut through the felt."

          "description":"When decorating a greeting card with felt, you probably have two scenarios: gluing felt to paper or cardstock, and gluing felt to felt. For these two cases, it\u2019s good to have two types of glue on hand. To glue felt to paper or cardstock, you will be fine with everyday white glue. To glue felt to felt, you will need something a bit more intense. Purchase special felt glue for this task, or use a hot glue gun if you have one available."

If this card is for a birthday or a wedding, you can create things like cake, balloons, flowers, and so on! Gather inspiration by looking at greeting cards in store or online.

          "description":"Unless you\u2019re an absolute pro with scissors, it\u2019s a good idea to outline your felt shapes or designs in pencil before cutting into the felt. You can purchase stencils at the craft store, or even print out stencils that you can find online. If you have a design in mind but aren\u2019t sure how to draw it, printing an outline or stencil online can be hugely helpful. Otherwise, simply freehand the design onto your felt. You can ensure it looks good before you do something irreversible with your scissors. Don\u2019t worry about leaving marks on the felt with your pencil. You can glue the felt to your cardstock with the marked up side down, so no one will ever see it!"

          "headline":"Layer pieces of felt.",
          "description":"While adding one piece of felt to a piece of cardstock or paper can add a lot as is, adding layered, three-dimensional designs can take your card to the next level. Before you glue any felt to your paper, try layering and building on your designs with different colors of felt. Even if the design doesn\u2019t require it, it can add a lot of interest to an otherwise simple design. For example, say you created a bright yellow sunshine to glue on your paper. Before gluing it down, why not add a bit of orange to the sun? Cut out the exact same shape in the orange felt, only smaller. When you glue it on top of the yellow shape, it will look like an orange sun with a yellow border. If you don\u2019t want to layer your shape entirely, you can just add little details with other colors. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to look great! Remember to use hot glue or felt glue to glue felt to felt. Regular glue may not be strong enough to hold felt together, and you don\u2019t want your greeting card to fall apart!"

Give your recipient this treat, but create a little pouch to hold the gift card, gift certificate, or bills! It\u2019s a very simple addition, but it can really make your card look polished and customized. Decide how big the pouch needs to be in order to hold the money or gift card. Measure out a square of felt that size, adding about 1/4 an inch on the sides and bottom. Once you\u2019ve cut out the square of felt, apply a line of glue to the bottom and the sides. This is why you made your felt square larger than the actual. Then, firmly press it onto your card. Allow your glue to dry, and slide the money or gift card into your new pouch."

          "description":"If you\u2019re hand delivering your card, you can make the entire envelope out of felt! This will make your greeting card even more special, and your recipient can keep or even reuse the adorable envelope. To create your envelope, you\u2019ll need a full sheet of felt (the size of a sheet of paper), a button, and some string, plus any decorations you want to add! Fold your piece of felt in half widthwise. It should now form a rectangle. Cut the folded felt in half. To make sure you cut it at the halfway mark, measure the length of the folded rectangle and make two marks on the top and bottom, exactly at the halfway mark. Grab one of the felt halves. Unfold it and cut three inches off of it at the top or bottom. Fold your felt in half lengthwise, so that it forms a long, thin rectangle. Now, you want to create a point on one end. Cut diagonally from the bottom corner (where the fold is) up to the other side. The felt that you\u2019re cutting off should be in the shape of a triangle. Unfold your felt. Position the pointed end at the top. Then, fold the bottom half upwards, forming the pocket of the envelope. Fold the pointed end overtop, forming the flap of the envelope. Use your glue to seal the sides of the envelope closed. Thread your button from the back and going through both holes. The two ends of your string should both be coming out of the back of the button. Then carefully make two slits on the front of the envelope pocket, thread your string through the holes, and tie it in a knot inside the envelope pocket. This will secure your button to the envelope pocket. Create another slit on the envelope flap, where it hits the button. Carefully push your button through that slit. This creates your envelope closure!"

Grab a piece of your desired color felt, and trace a circle in it. You can trace a CD, the base of a cup, or anything circular to get the perfect circle. Cut out your circle, and you\u2019re ready to construct your flower. Once you have your circle, start cutting it from the outside in a spiral pattern. To do this, simple cut a strip off circle around the perimeter, slowly moving inwards so eventually you\u2019ve cut the entire circle into one, long strip. At the outside end of the strip of felt, start rolling your felt like a burrito. As you roll along the length of the felt strip, focus on keeping one end of the roll tightly wound, with the other end a bit looser. If this step is confusing, visualize the flower you\u2019re creating. One side of the roll is tight, where it would attach to the stem. The other side is loose and open, showing the \u201cpetals.\u201d\nWhen you reach the end of the felt strip, add hot glue or felt glue to the tightly rolled end.
