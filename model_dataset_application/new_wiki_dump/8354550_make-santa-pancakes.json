If you\u2019re stuck for one, browse others on Wikihow, or simply follow this one for your batter:\nFor four pancakes, combine 1 cup (125 g) of flour, \u00bd teaspoon of baking powder, 1 tablespoon sugar, and \u00bc teaspoon salt in a large mixing bowl. Then stir in 1 cup (237 ml) of milk and 1 large egg until the batter turns smooth."

Cook each pancake on one side until the top begins to bubble. Then flip it over with a spatula and cook the second side until it turns golden brown. For each Santa that you plan to make, you can ladle out a \u00bc cup of batter for a standard-size pancake to use as Santa\u2019s head. Additionally, you can make a second pancake of equal size to trim down to an undersized body. Or, you can ladle out a 1/4 cup for the upper torso and a smaller portion for the head for a more proportionally correct Santa."

Use a paring knife to trace an outline for Santa\u2019s body. Discard the excess, or snack away on it while you repeat for any additional Santas. Alternatively, you could also save them to add to Santa\u2019s face or body."
