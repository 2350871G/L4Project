If there are any ridges on your bottlecap that are already bent slightly, start there! If not, you can pick any ridge to get started with. Slide the tip of the key under a ridge. Work your key tip until it\u2019s slightly under one of the bottlecap ridges. It\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t go all the way under -- all you need is a little bit of leverage.
