Though ripe bananas will work, overripe bananas are usually best for baking. They're easier to mash and they're typically more flavorful than green or young bananas."

          "description":"Marzipan is great for adding moisture to baked fruit dishes because it's an almond paste that melts into the mashed fruit, making it extra gooey. If you've put the marzipan into the freezer overnight, chop the marzipan up and put it in the bowl. If you've left the marzipan at room temperature, you can break it into small pieces with your hands and drop those into the mixture. To keep the marzipan pieces from sticking together, coat every piece with some flour before adding them to the mixing bowl."
