          "description":"Candles last longest when kept at low-to-moderate temperatures. For this reason, places like cupboards, closets, and dry basements tend to make the best storage locations. If you don\u2019t have one of these spaces available in your home, try stashing them in a spare drawer (away from lighters and matches), or even under your bed. Ideally, your candles should remain at a temperature between 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) and 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) while they\u2019re in storage. When bringing home a new haul or transporting your candles to another place, be careful not to leave them in your vehicle for too long, particularly if it\u2019s hot outside.Warning: Never leave your candles near an open flame or source of direct heat, such as radiators, space heaters, or kitchen appliances, even temporarily."

You might place them in a container with a locking lid, hide them, or perch them on a high shelf where they'll be safely out of reach. Some candles might look appetizing to curious young children and animals. It's also possible for older children to start accidental fires by lighting candles that have been stored with or near lighters or matches. Most candles are non-toxic. If ingested in large enough quantities, however, the wax used to make them can still pose significant health risks, such as intestinal blockage or allergic reaction."

It\u2019s even possible for candles to partially melt if they\u2019re left sitting in a poorly-positioned sunbeam. This also goes for other kinds of harsh light, such as desk lamps and spotlights."

While it may seem like a good idea in theory, lowering the temperature of the wax only hardens it, which in turn can lead to cracking, splitting, or permanent changes in texture. Repeated freezing and thawing can also be hard on the wicks, which absorb small amounts of moisture between burns. It\u2019s perfectly fine to stick a candle or two at the back of the fridge if you\u2019re hard up for space elsewhere. The only time you should put a candle in the freezer is if you\u2019re deliberately trying to break up the wax so you can reuse the jar for another purpose."
