Thompson's Water Seal Advanced Wood Protectors can be applied to damp lumber, so it's possible to clean and waterproof your deck in one day. Read the directions on the product you're using for temperature and weather guidelines, drying times, etc., and follow them!"

      "description":"You can use an oil base or water base sealer or stain, solid or semi-transparent. The best method for applying the material is with a brush or a paint pad on a long handle, available at any hardware store. Most materials can be sprayed also, but you will end up needing a lot more product this way. For a large deck, spraying will save time but you should brush the material into the wood. This will help with uniformity and provide a better looking job."
