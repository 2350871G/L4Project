      "description":"The following supplies can be found at any craft store. A blank mask\nAcrylic or tempera paint in a range of colors. (If you have a tight budget, buy yellow, blue, red, and black) With the paint, you will need paintbrushes in many sizes. Glitter. There are many ways to buy glitter, but I suggest glitter glue for small accents and loose glitter for bit impact. Glue. Like glitter, glue can be bought in many different forms. I suggest tacky glue for sequins, mod podge for large loose glitter, and spray glue or mod podge for fine loose glitter. Any other accents you find. These may be feathers, ribbon, or fabric flowers. If you decide to buy these, I suggest buying a hot glue gun to glue them on to the mask."
