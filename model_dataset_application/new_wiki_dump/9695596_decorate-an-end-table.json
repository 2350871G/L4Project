          "description":"Your accessories don't have to match the table exactly, but they should complement it. Try to stick with the same theme or type of materials when you choose your accessories. For example, if you have a rustic-looking table - made mostly from wood with an unfinished look - choose rustic accessories. These might include a vase made to look like a wooden branch or natural-looking flowers. If your table is made mostly from metal, consider choosing a few accessories that are also metal, but with a slightly different finish."

For example, if your favorite family photographs are in metal frames, use them to complement and decorate a metal end table. You can also stack up a few of your favorite books - just make sure you put them back after you read them so you don't lose your accessories!"

If you're using the table to decorate your space, you can choose accessories that will take up most of the table. If you want the table to more functional, use fewer accessories. For example, if you're using an end table to flank a larger piece of furniture, you can use more accessories. If you're placing the end tables near a sofa or chair to hold glasses, cups, or something else, use fewer accessories."

For example, if your house has a country feel to it, white or wooden end tables that look slightly unfinished will go well with similarly rustic accessories. If your home is more modern, choose sleek end tables with simple accessories."
