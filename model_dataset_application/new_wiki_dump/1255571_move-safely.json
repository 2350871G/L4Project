          "description":"Before you lift something, check the hallway and/or walkway to make sure the path is clear. Inspect all levels of the home or building in addition to the staircases, doorways, and sidewalk to ensure you can easily transport the items. If there are objects in the way, move them somewhere else so you can walk without tripping. Do not walk over slippery or uneven surfaces while carrying an item or you may fall. It\u2019s also a good idea to have a clear plan of where you are placing the item when you are finished transporting it."

          "headline":"Bend your legs when lifting furniture to avoid straining your back.",
          "description":"If you bend with your waist to lift an item from the ground, you are likely to strain your back and neck. To avoid this, bring your knees to a 90-degree angle to lift with your legs. This adjusts the weight of the object to your leg muscles rather than your back, making it a safer carrying option."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Lift the item by the handles or straps if you can.",
          "description":"Not every box or item will have a strap or a handle, but be sure to take advantage of it when you can. Carrying items by their handle helps to prevent damages in general. For example, some cardboard boxes are designed with handles on either side. If you are carrying items from bags, use the straps for support. Additionally, it is a good idea to support the weight by the bottom if carrying a heavy item."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Ensure you have a tight grip before you lift an item.",
          "description":"If you do not have a secure grasp of the box, furniture, or other items, you may drop it while carrying it. Always grip the item firmly to avoid any damage or injury. For example, if you are carrying a box, grasp it from the bottom corners. If you are helping a friend carry a couch, grip the bottom legs tightly. If your grip starts to slip, stop and make adjustments rather than trying to keep going. It\u2019s better to fix your grip than risk dropping the item."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Avoid quick twists or jerks that may result in pulled muscles.",
          "description":"When you transport the item, keep your body upright as much as you can. If you twist your hips suddenly or jerk your arm, you may drop the item or twist a muscle. This is especially true when carrying a heavy piece of furniture. By twisting your body unexpectedly, you can injure your back, neck, or legs, for instance."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Know your limits when moving items.",
          "description":"While this varies from person to person, it\u2019s important not to push yourself too far when moving things, as this can cause injury. For instance, if an item is too heavy for you, ask someone else to help you with it. If an item is up too high for you to reach, don\u2019t try jumping for it. It\u2019s okay to get help if you need it. If you are very tired after working all day, take a break or consider picking up where you left off the next day. To check how heavy an item is, push it across the floor. If you can easily push it with minimal effort, you should easily be able to carry it."

          "description":"It\u2019s best to have a first aid kit on hand just in case an accident does happen. Your first aid kit should include items such as bandages, tape, dressing, alcohol swabs, safety pins, scissors, eye wash solution, antiseptic, gloves, and antibacterial cream. If you or someone else gets cut, scraped, or burned, you can easily treat the wound. For example, use a bandage or gauze if you accidentally slice your arm on the bottom corner of a box."

          "headline":"Wear gloves to keep your fingers protected.",
          "description":"Work gloves are often made from a canvas material. They make it easier to grip items and avoid scrapes and cuts. Put these on both hands before you lift items to help you move safely. If you don\u2019t wear gloves, you may loosen your grip on a heavy item or get scratched as you carry a box."

          "headline":"Put on closed-toed shoes to prevent hurting your toes.",
          "description":"Wear comfortable sneakers or boots when moving your items. This way, you can keep your feet protected in the case of an accident. If you drop an item on your exposed foot, you can get injured. If you wear sandals or flip-flops, for instance, you may wind up with a stubbed toe or a bruised foot. High heels are not a good idea for moving day."

        {
          "headline":"Pick clothing that fits well so the fabric doesn't get caught or twisted.",
          "description":"When moving, it is best to go with form-fitting clothing rather than baggy shirts or pants. Loose clothing can easily get caught underneath an item and cause injury or muscle strain. To easily prevent injury, choose a long-sleeved or short-sleeved shirt that fits you well and go with comfortable shorts or jeans."

          "description":"A hand truck is a device made to help move items 600 lbs (212 kg) and under. It has 3 wheels and a small ledge for items to rest on while transporting them. To use the hand truck, place a box or item onto the ledge, and stack the heaviest items first. If you have straps, use them to secure the boxes to the truck. Then, tilt the handle, kick up the wheels, and pull the truck forward. This is an easy way to move a stack of heavy boxes, for example."

          "headline":"Use a dolly to help you move large, heavy items.",
          "description":"A dolly is a small platform on 4 wheels that help move items up to 1,000 lbs (454 kg). They are often used to move heavy boxes or large furniture items. To use a dolly, simply stack the item on top so it is central and stable. Using a dolly is a great idea if moving a heavy dresser or entertainment center, for example. With a partner, lift up either side and slide a dolly underneath. Depending on the size of the item, you may need 2 dollies for extra stability."

          "headline":"Climb a ladder to reach items high above rather than reaching up.",
          "description":"If you reach up high to grab an item, you may strain a muscle or cause the item to fall. Instead, use a ladder or step-stool to help you reach objects above your head. For extra security, it\u2019s helpful to have a partner spot you by holding onto the ladder."

        {
          "headline":"Hire a professional if you don\u2019t feel suited to move your items safely.",
          "description":"If you do not feel confident that you can carry all of your things even with the help of friends, dollies, and other moving supplies, it\u2019s best to hire a professional moving team. Search online for moving companies in your area, and ask for a price quote based on the number of items and moving distance."

Other breakfast ideas include a fruit and yogurt parfait or sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich. You can also take snack breaks when you need to keep up your energy."

Drink a large glass of water before you get started, and remember to continue to drink water throughout the entire day. The amount of water you should drink per day varies on gender, body weight, and overall health, but on average, you should drink between 6-12 cups (2-3 L) each day."

          "description":"It is oftentimes easier to start moving at the beginning of the day, since you are likely much more focused, attentive, and ready to go. Towards the evening, you may get tired and lose your energy. Feel free to take breaks as needed and stop for the day when it seems right. This is especially a good idea in the summertime since the hottest point of the day is usually in the middle of the afternoon. If you overstrain yourself while moving, you can pull a muscle or get seriously injured. It\u2019s always better to pace yourself rather than rushing through the job."
