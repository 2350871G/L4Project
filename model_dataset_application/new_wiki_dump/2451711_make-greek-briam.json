Alternatively, you may remove the onions and garlic once fried, and  layer the vegetables with the potato at the bottom in layers much like a  lasagne. Mix the tomatoes, onions and herbs together as a sauce and add  that as layers in between the other vegetables."

      "description":"If you made the first mixed method (instead of  layering), stir occasionally to ensure the sauce develops and that it  cooks evenly. Add a little more water or wine if it seems dry and stir to coat. If you followed the layered method, pour a little water or wine on the top. Be conservative with adding extra fluid. The sauce should be absorbed into the vegetables so there is not so much as a gravy or sauce but that the  vegetables remain distinct. If you can get away with adding no extra liquid the dish will be more intense in flavour."
