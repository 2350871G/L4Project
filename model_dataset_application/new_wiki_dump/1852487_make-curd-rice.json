You should always rinse rice before you cook it. Rinsing the rice gets rid of surface starches and helps prevent clumping. Rinsing can also give a fresher taste to the dish. Wash the rice by stirring it in circles with your fingers. You can also rub the rice gently to loosen the starches."

You can also pressure cook the rice with 2 cups of water for 4 whistles, or on a low flame for 1 whistle. The rice should be mushy and overcooked. You can also cook the rice in a pot. To do this, keep the rice covered in water for 30 minutes. Bring 6 cups of water to boil in a pot, then add the rice. Bring to boil again. Boil for 12 minutes. Drain and put this in a bowl. Add salt immediately to prevent clumps as it cools."

Stir continuously as you saut\u00e9 over a medium flame for about a minute. Make sure the coriander and curry leaves are chopped finely. Chop the green chili into big pieces.
