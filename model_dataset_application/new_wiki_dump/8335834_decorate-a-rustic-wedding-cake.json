Gently press the tongs of the fork vertically into the cake icing. After you have removed your fork, rotate it so that the tongs are horizontal. Press the fork into the icing again over the vertical stripes you just created. Add these flourishes along the base of the cake for an understated stripe of texture, or cover the entire tier for a bolder look."

These bare layers will offer a fresh and unique look for the sweet focal point of your reception. You can leave the body of the cake icing-free but cover the tops of the layers in white icing. Choosing a cake that is not covered in icing or fondant will help ensure its freshness. The cake\u2019s frosting acts as a barrier that prevents the cake from drying out too quickly. Without this layer, the baker will need to bake the cake on the day of your wedding, ensuring that the naked wedding cake is as fresh as possible."
