It is best to start this project when the ectomycorrhizal fungi have fruiting bodies (mushrooms) for identification purposes. Go to a wooded area. Identify a tree or plant that commonly has ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with it. (If possible find one within the same genus or species as the plant you will transplant to in order to ensure success.) Identify an ectomycorrhizal fungus. It should be associated with the tree or plant that you found in step one. Dig near the fungus. Using your plastic spoon and fork, carefully dig around the fungus and approximately 8 inches (20.3 cm) down so that you can clearly see its mycelia. Remove a small section of mycelia attaching the mushroom with the plant root. (The mycelia will grow back and produce another mushroom next year).
