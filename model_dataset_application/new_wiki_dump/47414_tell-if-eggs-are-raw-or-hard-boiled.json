Egg shells are not completely solid \u2014 they are actually covered by thousands of tiny holes that sometimes can allow gases to pass through. Heating the egg makes the gas inside the shell to expand and pass through these holes, creating bubbles. If the egg is boiled, you probably won't see these bubbles because the gas was already forced out during the boiling process."

This test works best with smaller flashlights so that the rim of the flashlight forms a tight \"seal\" against the egg shell. If the egg lights up like a lantern, it is raw. The liquid inside allows the light through. If the egg is dark and opaque, it is hard-boiled. The solid white and yolk do not let the light through."

One simple way to do this is to drop some loose onion skins into the boiling water with the eggs. The boiled eggs will come out a nice beige color. This makes them easy to tell apart from your raw eggs. The more onion skins you use, the more noticeable the dying effect. If you can, use about 12 onions' worth of skins to get eggs with a deeply-dyed appearance. Skins from red onions also tend to dye the eggs more darkly than skins from white or yellow onions."

Otherwise, boil the eggs first, then soak them in a mixture of 1/2 cup boiling water, 1 teaspoon vinegar, and a few drops of food coloring afterward."

When they are completely dry, mark them on the shell with a pencil or marker. For instance, you can try writing \"B\" for \"boiled.\" Don't worry \u2014 since you have to remove the shell to eat boiled eggs, this doesn't make your eggs unsafe to eat, even if you use ink."
