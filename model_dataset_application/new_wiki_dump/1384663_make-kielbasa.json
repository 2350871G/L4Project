  "text":" Preparing the Ingredients and Equipment Freeze the meat and chill the sausage making equipment. It's important for the meat and equipment to stay very cold during the entire process of making sausage. If the meat and fat get warm, they will not properly blend, and the resulting sausage will suffer in taste and texture. Clear out your freezer and place the following ingredients and equipment inside:\nThe pork butt and fat\nThe meat grinder\nThe sausage stuffer\nSeveral metal bowls Prepare an iced bowl. When you begin working with the meat, you have to keep it cold while it's outside the freezer. Set a large metal bowl on your work surface, and fill it halfway with ice. Place a smaller metal bowl on top of the ice and let it get thoroughly cold. Cut the pork meat and fat into strips. The pork and fat must be cut into pieces small enough to fit into the meat grinder before you begin. Remove them from the freezer. Use a sharp knife to slice one to two-inch pieces from the bone, and then cut the fat into similar-sized cubes. Place the meat and fat pieces in the iced bowl. Add the spices. In a separate bowl, mix the kosher salt, curing salt, pepper, marjoram, sugar, and minced garlic. Add the mixture to the meat and work it in with your hands until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the freezer for 30 minutes. Grinding the Meat Prepare the casings. Place the sausage casings in a bowl of warm water while the meat mixture is freezing. This softens them to make them easier to stuff without ripping. Remove the grinder from the freezer. Set up the meat grinder in a large, clean work area. Place a clean chilled bowl next to the grinder to catch the ground meat as it comes out of the machine. Grind the meat. Remove the meat mixture from the freezer. The meat pieces should be frozen on the outside, but still slightly soft in the middle.

When you're finished, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the freezer while you get the stuffing equipment ready. Stuffing the Sausages Get the stuffing equipment ready. Remove the sausage stuffer from the freezer and set it up on your clean work surface. Lift the sausage casings from the bowl of water and run warm water through them from the faucet to open them up. Drape them over the rim of the bowl of water so the first part of the casing is ready to use and the tail continues to soak. Set up a cold platter where you can place the stuffed sausages, then remove the meat from the freezer. Make sure none of the casings have a rip in them. A hole in the casing will ruin the sausage. Don't take the meat from the freezer until you are ready to start stuffing. Fit a casing onto the stuffing tube. Take a casing and fit its entire length onto the tube, leaving a tail of 8\u201312 inches (20.3\u201330.5 cm) hanging off the end. This will be knotted later, but for now, it should remain open. Each casing is several feet long, so you may only need one for an entire batch of sausage. Stuff the casing. Fill the machine with the meat. If you have any left over, place it in a bowl on ice. Begin cranking the machine so the sausage begins moving into the casing. As the meat fills the casing, use one hand to help guide the casing from the tube so it doesn't rip. Use the other hand to begin coiling the sausage on the platter. Don't let the machine work too quickly if this is your first time making sausage. You can easily go too fast and accidentally rip the sausage. If you need to move on to a second casing, stop the machine and remove the end of the first casing, then fit a new casing on the stuffing tube. Check for air bubbles. When you're finished stuffing, check the sausages for air bubbles. If you see any, use a sterilized needle to prick the casing so it lies flat against the meat. Form the sausage into links. Tie off the casings at the front end, leaving the end with the long tail open for now. Measure six inches from the knot and pinch the sausage with your thumb and forefinger. Use your hands to twist the two pieces on either side of the pinch toward yourself three times. Measure another six inches down the coil and repeat, twisting away from you three times this time. Continue until you have reached the end of the sausage, and then knot the end tightly against the meat. Drying and Smoking the Kielbasa Hang the links. Hang the sausage from the twists in the links in a cool, dry storage area for about an hour. If the air is cold, you can hang them for several hours. Smoke the links. This adds gives the kielbasa its classic smoky flavor. Light up your smoker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place the links in the smoker for about 4 hours or longer if you prefer a smokier flavor. The links should come to an internal temperature of 155 degrees. The wood you use to smoke the sausages will affect their flavor. Cherry wood and applewood are good choices. The longer you smoke the sausages, the smokier they will taste. Don't leave them in the smoker for longer than 8 hours or the flavor will be affected. Cold shock the sausages. When the sausages are ready, remove them from the smoker and plunge them into icy water for a few minutes to cool them down. Hang them up to dry for a few hours, then eat them, or store them for later use.",
