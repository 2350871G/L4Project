A lower temperature would require a longer cooking time, resulting in dry bread. If you want a soft interior with a chewy crust, 350\u2109 (175\u2103) is the way to go. It's better to slice the bread after reheating rather than slicing it before reheating. Sliced bread will heat quickly and become hard and crunchy if you're not careful. However, if you want to make bread crumbs or croutons, you can slice or dice the bread. Toss it with some melted butter, a dash of salt and pepper and some garlic powder, and you'll end up with a delicious topping for your salad."
