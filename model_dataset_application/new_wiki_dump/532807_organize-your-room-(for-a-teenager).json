      "description":"Think of it as a new room. How would you like to live in it? Grab a piece of paper and sketch out how you'd like your room to look like. Start with the basics like a Clothes Space, a School Space, a Sleeping Space, etc. Different spaces are devoted to different activities. Next, write down any other spaces you would like to create for the things you like. For example, a Music Space, a Reading Space, etc. You might not have room now, but this might change."

Separate your stuff in the containers such as maybe one container for hair stuff or one for pencils. The pencils one could be in a funky jar. Speaking of drawers; drawers also make great containers to put your stuff in. Just remember; everything should have a home."
