          "description":"A speed square is a right-triangle shaped tool that has angles marked along the hypotenuse (the long side). Use the angles on the edge to guide your drilling. Set the speed square right next to the hole you're drilling. Line up the drill so the top is along the flat side of the speed square. It will almost look like you're drilling into the right angle. Line up the angle markings on the hypotenuse with the center line down the top of the drill. Drill down into the wood at that angle."

          "description":"Measure the angle you need on a flat piece of scrap wood that's at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Cut the wood at that angle using a hand saw or radial saw. To cut the wood at an angle, mark the angle along the edge. Use a handsaw to go along that angle. If you're using a radial saw, set it to the angle you need before cutting. Set the wood down where you need to drill. Lay the drill along the angle, and use the wood to guide the drill while pushing into the wood. Make sure to hold on tight to the guiding piece of wood while drilling."

          "description":"Another option is to drill straight down into the wood to create small pilot holes. You only need to go down about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm). Pull the drill out. Start drilling again with the drill angled straight down into the pilot holes you've created, and then tilt it to the angle you need as you go in the hole. Pocket holes are what you use to connect 2 pieces of wood at an angle. The angle doesn't need to be precise, so you don't need to measure it. Aim for about a 45\u00b0 angle, and you should be fine. This method helps keep the drill bit from breaking."

Use a table saw to cut the piece down to size, making it perfectly rectangular. It should fit easily on top of your drill press plate, though keep it mind you will angle it up towards the drill. You can trace the drill press plate to get an idea for the size you'll need. You can use scrap plywood for this project, but it should be sturdy enough so that it doesn't bend when you're drilling down towards it. Add a fence to the front of the piece of plywood. Screw a small piece of wood onto the front of the plywood. The front is whatever part will be facing up on the drill press plate. The wood should be almost the length of the plywood and 0.5 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick. When looking at the plywood as you face the drill press, this piece should run from top to bottom 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the left edge. Some fences also run from left to right 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the bottom instead. A fence helps you keep your project in place.

Clamp a long piece of wood to the back of the drill press plate. Attach c-clamps on each end. Now you can push the jig up against this piece of wood so it doesn't slide around. Drill your holes into your project. Place your project piece on the jig up against the fence. Bring the drill down and drill holes into the piece where you need them. If your piece is moving around too much, clamp it into place against the fence. Now you can drill the same angle each time with precision. Adjust the jig as needed.
