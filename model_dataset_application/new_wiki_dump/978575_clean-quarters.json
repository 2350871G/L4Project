Metal containers may also react with the surface of the quarter. You can also hold the quarter under running hot water, but make sure that you have the drain covered. Hold the quarter by the edges, between your thumb and forefinger. If you are soaking more than one quarter at a time, make sure that there is enough space between each one. If they are all touching, they are more likely to get scratched or dinged. Check the dates of the quarters to avoid soaking two different kinds of metals together. Quarters minted in 1964 and earlier were made mostly from silver. Quarters minted in 1965 and after were made from copper and nickel."
