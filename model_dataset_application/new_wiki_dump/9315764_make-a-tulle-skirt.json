          "description":"Making a no-sew tulle skirt is easy and all it requires is a lot of tulle and enough elastic to fit around your waist. You will need about 20 yards of tulle to make your skirt. Choose any color of tulle and elastic that you want to use. Elastic is usually only available in black and white, but tulle comes in many different colors. You will also need a sharp pair of scissors to cut the tulle."

          "headline":"Cut the tulle into long, wide strips.",
          "description":"Fold your tulle in half width-wise and then use a ruler to measure out sections of tulle that are about 18\u201d (46 cm) wide. Cut out your tulle strips while the fabric is still folded in half and stack them up with the fold intact."

If you are sure about the waist measurement, then you can also cut the elastic band to that width and then staple or sew the ends together."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Tie the tulle strips to the elastic band.",
          "description":"Next, you will need to tie your folded tulle strips onto the elastic band. Bring the folded end of the tulle strip behind the elastic and pull it up above the level of the elastic slightly. Then, bring the ends of the tulle strip up in front of the elastic strip and thread them through the loop of the folded tulle. Pull the strips all the way through the loop to create a knot. This will secure the tulle strip around the elastic. Repeat this process all the way around the elastic until you have completely covered the elastic with the tulle strips. Make sure to push the knots together as you go to ensure that the skirt will be as full as possible."

          "headline":"Spread and scrunch the tulle as desired.",
          "description":"Once you have all of the strips on the elastic, use your hands to spread out and scrunch the tulle. Spreading it out will give a full, flowy effect, and it will also help to ensure that the strips overlap each other. Scrunching the tulle will also add fullness and it will make the skirt appear more structured."

          "headline":"Trim the bottom of the skirt if needed.",
          "description":"If the skirt is longer than you wanted it to be, then you can trim the bottom to shorten it. Have your model try on the skirt, or put the skirt on a dress form, and then trim around the bottom edges to get the skirt to the desired length. Make sure to cut carefully and get the edges as even as possible."

          "description":"You can use any color of tulle that you want. Just keep in mind that you will need a lot of it to make your skirt, so try to choose tulle that is on sale or reasonably priced to help keep your costs down. You will also need fabric to line your skirt. You can use any lightweight fabric, such as a cotton or broadcloth. Also, make sure to purchase a wide band of elastic. You will need enough elastic to go around your waist. You will need a piece of lining fabric that is 2.5 times the width of your waist measurement. For example, if your waist measures 30\u201d (76 cm), then you will need 75\u201d (191 cm) of lining fabric. The length of the fabric should be the desired length of your tulle skirt plus 1\u201d (2.5 cm). You will need a large amount of tulle to create a gathered skirt. Plan to purchase 20 yards for an adult size skirt or about 10 yards for a child size skirt. Elastic usually comes in black and white. Choose the option that works best with the tulle you are using. Make sure to measure your waist before you buy your elastic and get enough elastic to fit around your waist."

To hem your lining, fold over the top and bottom edges of your lining piece by \u00bc\u201d (0.6 cm) and sew along the edges to secure them. If desired, you may fold over the fabric again and sew again to completely cover the raw edge, but this is optional."

Repeat this for the edges of the lining fabric circle that are now opposite each other so that you have four corners pinned to the elastic band. Then, gather the areas in between the four corners.
