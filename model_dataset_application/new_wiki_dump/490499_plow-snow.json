Make sure that you can comfortably hold the steering wheel while you hold the controls in your other hand. This will be more difficult in a manual transmission truck than it would be in an automatic transmission vehicle. In a manual truck, use your offhand to control the plow and the truck gears."

Angling the plow will also allow cool air to flow through the grill of the truck, which will prevent it from overheating."

Double tap on the down button to put the blade into float mode. If your plow doesn\u2019t have a float mode, simply press the down button until the bottom edge of the plow touches the ground."

If the snow is frozen or compacted, drive 5\u201310 miles per hour (8.0\u201316.1 km/h) slower than you normally would. Never drive over 15 miles per hour (24 km/h) while the plow is down. Keep your speed under 40 miles per hour (64 km/h) while the plow is up so that you don\u2019t overheat your engine."

Using Common Plowing Strategies Start plowing when the snow reaches 1 inch (2.5 cm) of accumulation. Allowing snow to build up will make plowing slower because you\u2019ll have to drive slower. Plow the snow when it reaches 1 inch (2.5 cm) and continue replowing the same areas to keep the accumulation at a constant low. Plow before rush hour traffic.

Attach small wooden stakes together with string and push them into the snow along the edge of the driveway. The stakes will act as a guide and will prevent you from plowing over lawns and flower beds on curved driveways. Purchasing the Right Plow Use a pickup truck that's .5\u2013.75 metric tons (1,100\u20131,700 lb).
