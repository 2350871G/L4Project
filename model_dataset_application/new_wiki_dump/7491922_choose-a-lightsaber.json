A lightwhip can be very difficult to defend against, as it can wrap around your blade and rip it from your hand. They also have substantial shock value - almost nobody has ever encountered one. However, there are good reasons why - the lightwhip has a vast array of weaknesses. There are ways to compensate, however. You can use a shoto alongside your lightwhip, or use some kind of saberstaff hybrid - whip on one side, blade on the other (obviously don't activate both at once). Or you can do what Lumiya, Dark Lady of the Sith, did: make a lightwhip with multiple tendrils, some energy, some solid, that can lash out at multiple angles simultaneously. Here are some weaknesses:\nThe blade is weaker than that of a lightsaber. This stops it from cutting through walls, although it can still cut flesh. The blade can short out if it is hit hard enough with a lightsaber. A lightwhip has absolutely no defensive value. Being flexible, a lightwhip cannot block another saber. This pretty much eliminates lightwhips as an option for most Jedi. It is very easy to hit yourself with a lightwhip. It's useless against dual blades - your opponent can tangle your whip with one blade, then use the other to kill you."
