      "description":"A Diving Tank will extend your oxygen to 1 minute, 25 seconds without any upgrades to the Diving skill. The Snorkel will vastly improve your vision underwater, making bubbles, rocks, and patterns in the ground sharper. This will create greater contrast between the shiny gold ring and the gray ocean floor."

      "description":"Go into the water on the side of the tents, and go close to the ladder besides Ensign Simon. Look towards the west (Ensign Simon is facing North), the ship should jut out about 10 feet in front of you. Swim on the top of the water until you hit the ship (the part the juts out), and dive straight down. The ring will be right under you."

Then head over to Gwen's tent and present her with the ring. Gwen will award you 25 experience and 5 reputation."
