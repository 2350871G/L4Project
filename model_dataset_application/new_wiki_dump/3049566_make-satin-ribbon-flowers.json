          "description":"You can make a simple flower with ribbon by forming loops for the petals, and securing them with a stitch or some glue. If you want to try this method you will need to gather up your ribbon, a button for each flower you want to make, some thread and a needle. You can also use a glue gun if you have one. If you want to make the optional stem, you will need floral wire and floral tape. For this method you should use a heavy double-faced satin ribbon that will keep its shape."

          "headline":"Cut the ribbon.",
          "description":"Now cut the ribbon strands to the desired length. This will depend on how big you want your flowers to be. Try 13-inch strips for a large flower and 6-inch strips for a small flower. The number of strips you use will also depend on the size of the flower, and how many loop petals you want it to have. A simple flower could be made from just four lengths. For a flower with a fuller look and more petals, try eight using 8 lengths of ribbon."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Position the strands.",
          "description":"Now you need to place the ribbon strands down in a star pattern, before making the loops. Start by placing one ribbon in a vertical line down the centre and then placing a ribbon horizontally across the middle of this ribbon to form a cross. Then you can lay the other ribbon strands in diagonal lines evenly across the cross to create the desired flower pattern. If you are struggling to visualise the pattern, it might help to think of the asterisk symbol. Once you have them in a position you like, fix them together by stitching or gluing the centre."

          "description":"Now you can make the strands into the petal loops. Take a strand at one of the ends away from the centre, and fold it up and in towards centre of the flower. Depending on how many strands you are using, you may need to secure a few of the loops before moving on the next one. If possible, just hold the loops in place until you have made them all so that you can secure them all in place at the same time. Make some stitches through the centre of the flower to secure all the ribbon loops in place."

          "description":"Once you have created all the loops, you can secure them in place and create a nice central point to your flower. Get the button and either stitch it into the centre, or glue it in. Stitching it in will make it easier for you to tie all the loops in together."

Now the wire should extend down from the centre of the flower and look like a stem. To finish it off, wrap the floral tape around the wire. This will give it a nicer finish."

          "description":"You can make flowers with pleated satin ribbon fairly easily. You will need a length of ribbon between about 18 and 24-inches long. You will also need some quick drying and strong glue. If you have a glue gun, you can use that. To form the base of the flower, you need a chipboard circle, and for the centrepiece you will need a button. The diameter of the chipboard circle will depend on the size of flower you want to make. A few inches diameter should be okay for a length of ribbon that is 18-inches long."

          "description":"Start rolling up one end of the ribbon in a spiral in one hand, so you have the beginnings of your flower. Place a blob of glue at the centre of the chipboard backing and press the centre of the small spiral onto the glue. The glue will dry quickly so you need to be able to work fast to stick the ribbon down."

          "description":"Once you have stuck down the centre of the flower, you will wrap the ribbon around in a growing spiral. Add more glue to chipboard backing as you go and stick the ribbon down. This is tricky work, but you will still need to act quite quickly. As you wind the ribbon and stick in down, you will see that it is developing into a flower pattern. Once you have covered the chipboard backing circle, trim off any excess of ribbon. Finish it off by gluing your centrepiece button into the heart of the flower."

You can stitch over the edges if you are concerned about fraying. You will also need a threaded needle ready to go. Make the first folds. About 8-inches from the left-hand side of the ribbon, fold the ribbon over so that the long end is horizontal and the shorter end is vertical. It should look like an upside-down L.\nNow take the long right-hand end and fold it down so that it is vertical, and parallel with the shorter end. The fold should create something that looks a bit like an arrowhead. You should have a little gap of around 1/8 of an inch between the two ends. Keep folding. Then bring the long end over the short end, so that it is horizontal again and the arrowhead shape becomes more like a square. You will then need to repeat this folding pattern, bringing one end up over the other, and then vice versa. You will notice a concertina pattern developing as you fold. Do this until you have at least three layers of ribbon. Pass the end through the gap. Once you have folded it over so you have at least three layers, carefully lift it up. Take care to ensure that it all stays together, pinching the area where the folds are between your thumb and forefinger. Then take the end of the longer end of the ribbon and pass it through the square gap at the centre of the folds. Gently pull the ribbon through, but leave a little bit at the top on the other side of the folded area. Twist the end. Now take the long end of the ribbon that you have passed through the hole in one hand, and hold the folds with your other hand.
