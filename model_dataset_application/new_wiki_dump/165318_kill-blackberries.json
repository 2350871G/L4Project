Make sure to dig around the root ball so that you don\u2019t break it up and potentially release seeds or stems into the soil. Be aware that digging up the root ball will not kill the plant since some plant material may remain, but this does make tilling the soil much easier."

Not only can this ensure easier tilling, but can also remove a major source of rhizomes that can propagate the bush. However, keep in mind that blackberry plants do not form a tight root ball like some other plants and the roots can run a long way underground. Follow the roots to the ends and then carefully dig them up with a trowel. Use gloves when you remove the root ball to minimize the risk of cutting yourself. Dig further around the root ball if it doesn\u2019t come out when you pull on it. This may allow you to get most bits of root in one movement. Dispose of the root ball in the same way you did the stems."

This can help remove or starve any material, including rhizomes, which are also called rootstocks, that can propagate further plants. Use a cultivator fork or deep spade to turn over and break up soil in small areas. You can purchase these at most home improvement and hardware stores. Rent an engine-powered tiller for larger areas. You can rent (or buy) these at home improvement and hardware stores. Be sure that you\u2019ve broken up and turned over your soil by examining it. The soil will often look darker if it\u2019s come from under the surface. If you do not want to till the soil, then you can also just mow over any shoots that do come up.

This allows it to get into the plant\u2019s structure and kill rhizomes, thus deterring regrowth. Use foliar-based herbicides, which you apply to the part of the plant visible above the ground, in early summer or at the start of the growing season when their tissue is rapidly expanding. Spray herbicides such as glyphosate, dicamba, or triclopyr on the blackberry bush. You can purchase these at many home improvement and hardware stores.

This can help kill the bush at any time of year and also minimize contact with chemicals. Use a concentrated form of triclopyr to treat the basal bark. Spray the solution directly at base of the bush directly on the bark. Cover about 6-12 inches of the basal bark with spray, depending on how large the plant is.
