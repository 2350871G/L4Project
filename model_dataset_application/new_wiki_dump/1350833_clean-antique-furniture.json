          "description":"To start, choose a mild cleaner. As you want to keep antique furniture as damage-free as possible, harsh chemicals are a bad idea. A mild dish soap diluted in water is a safe choice for most antiques. Use dish soap intended for hand washing dishes. Soap that you would use in a dishwasher is more acidic. If dish soap is not successfully removing grime, it's okay to opt for a slightly stronger cleaner. Something like Murphy's Oil would work, but use only a small amount. You should not use an abundance of oily products on older furniture. Some experts feel furniture paste wax, which you can find at most hardware stores or department stores, is a better option for cleaning antiques than oil."

Keep wiping the surface with the same rag until the rag no longer picks up new dirt or debris. Avoid scrubbing, as this can damage the finish of old furniture. Use gentle wiping motions instead. Move the rag in the direction of the grain of the wood."

Rub in the direction of the wood grain. Keep rubbing until the unwanted dirt and debris is gone. Make sure not to use too much force. This can damage the finish."

Store the furniture elsewhere until the infestation is resolved. Check for any loose or damaged bits before moving antique furniture. You should not carry furniture in areas that are wobbly or dislodged. Carry chairs by the seat rails. Carry tables by the apron or legs.
