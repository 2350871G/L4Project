Boxelder bugs do not bite or sting, so there is no risk of injury or pain. You do need to have quick reflexes, as these bugs can move pretty quickly. Be sure not to squish the bugs while you pick them up. Squished boxelder bugs can give off a noxious smell, which you don't want in your home."

          "description":"If you don't want the close contact required of picking the bugs up by hand, you can just use a broom to sweep them up or out the door. Be careful and sweep them up gently, as squishing them with your broom can release a bad smell. Boxelder bugs that you remove from your house can be placed back outside if you don't want to kill them. This method does run the risk that the same bugs will reenter your house in the future."

        {
          "headline":"Use a vacuum to get rid of them.",
          "description":"The easiest way to get rid of the bugs that are in your house is to use a vacuum to suck them up. This requires you to have a vacuum out and ready to use when you see a boxelder bug. Be sure to empty out your vacuum bag or canister quickly after sucking up bugs. You can either deposit the bag directly into the garbage (knowing that some of the bugs are still alive inside the bag) or place it in the freezer overnight to kill the bugs. If you freeze the bugs to death, you can then take the vacuum bag out of the freezer and continue to use the same bag in your vacuum."

          "headline":"Kill the bugs.",
          "description":"You can kill boxelder bugs if you need to. This can be done by spraying a mixture of soap and water directly onto the bugs. This mixture, made of five tablespoons of laundry soap mixed into one gallon of water, only works when the soap mixture is wet and applied directly to the bugs, so it may need to be reapplied if new bugs emerge. You should not use insecticide if the boxelder bugs are in your house. First of all, insecticides are poison and bringing poison into your house can create a health risk to you, your family, and your pets. Secondly, killing boxelder bugs in your house, and not knowing where the dead bugs are, can attract other bugs that eat the carcasses."

For homes with plaster, stucco, stone, or brick veneer exteriors, check the outside walls for significant cracks. Especially check places where different materials meet, or where horizontal and vertical surfaces meet. Use caulking suitable for outside locations and the surface you are applying it to to seal these cracks. For stone or brick veneer, do not seal the weep holes with caulk, as they allow moisture to drain. Instead, use a bug screen or other solution that is sold at your local hardware store."

Make sure that all screens on windows and doors are completely sealed. Boxelder bugs can fit through very small holes (about 1/8 of an inch).

Filling the space between the floor and the bottom of the door can be done by either attaching a door sweep to the bottom of the door or adding a threshold to the floor beneath the door. For a door sweep, you usually attach a strip that is specially designed for this use to the bottom, inside edge of the door with screws or some form of adhesive. The length of the strip should be the same width as your door. A threshold is added by screwing it to the floor under the door. Be careful, however, because a threshold can be a tripping hazard."

If they are not near your house, your house is less likely to be infested with boxelder bugs. Removing the trees that boxelder bugs feed on is not a particularly effective solution, since boxelder bugs can travel more than a mile in search of winter shelter. So, removing the trees on your property will not ensure that your home does not become infested. If boxelder bugs become a major problem in your community, you may consider organizing at a community-wide level. However, boxelder bug infestations are usually only widespread in particularly warm years. It is best to use the methods described above to combat the bugs and to avoid the drastic measure of removing trees from your local habitat. Boxelder bugs reproduce on female boxelder trees. Removing these trees specifically may be the most effective tree removal process for limiting the bug's numbers near your home."
