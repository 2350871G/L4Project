Attach a deep fry thermometer to the pot, and heat the oil over medium-high until it reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). You can substitute peanut oil for the vegetable oil if you prefer. A candy thermometer will also work to monitor the temperature of the oil."

Use a sharp knife to slice it into sticks that are approximately \u00bd-inch (13-mm) thick. A vegetable peeler works well to remove the skin from the butternut squash. To remove the seeds from inside the squash, you usually only need a regular spoon."

Allow the squash to cook until they become golden brown and crisp, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Be careful not to add too many fries to the oil at once or the temperature may drop. Use a wooden spoon to stir the fries gently while they\u2019re frying. That will help ensure that they cook evenly on all sides."
