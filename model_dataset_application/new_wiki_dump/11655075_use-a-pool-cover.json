          "description":"Start in a corner of the pool. Line the end of the cover up with the edge of the pool. Then, roll the cover out along the edge until you reach the other side. Some plastic covers, especially solar covers, have bubbles that make them look like bubble wrap. If your cover has bubbles, lay it down so the bubbles face the water. If you have a round pool and cover, then pick a side to start on. Unroll the cover gradually until it stretches across the pool. These instructions will work for any plastic cover, even if it isn\u2019t a solar cover. Any plastic sheet can keep leaves and other debris out of the pool."

Work until the cover reaches across the width of the pool. If the cover is too short by a few inches on either side, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll still get a warming effect from the cover even if some water is still exposed."

          "description":"If the cover stretches far over the edge of the pool and you want to make it fit better, then you can trim the cover. Take a pair of sharp scissors and cut along the edge of the pool in a straight line. For a perfect fit, you can make a waterline cut right along where the water meets the pool. Then your cover will be perfectly-sized. If you prefer leaving some behind, cut the cover 2 inches (5.1 cm) further than the waterline and tuck the excess under the pool edge. Cutting the cover is optional. The cover will still function fine if it\u2019s a bit too long."

Look in a pool supply store for a roller the correct size for your pool and install it for greater convenience. These rollers usually attach to the ground around the edge of inground pools. If you have an above-ground pool, you may need a special stand to attach the roller to. You may need a professional to install the roller. Look around for pool installers in your area."

For the best results, keep the pool covered at all times when you\u2019re not using it. Replace the cover once you\u2019re done with it so it\u2019s clean and warm the next time you want to swim.
