Several websites have templates for emergency plans, like https://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan."

          "description":"Consider scenarios for the events that are most likely to happen in your area. Make sure everyone in your family knows how to react to different disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, fires, winter storms, and power outages. Pinpoint the safest spots in your home for each type of disaster. For example, make an emergency plan for a flood if you live near a waterway, or an emergency plan for a winter storm if you live in a cold climate. The highest level in your home is the safest place during a flood, while the lowest level is safest during a tornado, for instance."

          "headline":"Identify 3 ways to get warnings.",
          "description":"Sirens are generally insufficient warnings for natural disasters. However, in case of a power outage, you cannot rely solely on your television or landline phone for warnings, either. Sign up to receive emergency alerts from your local government by text message or email. You should also have a battery-operated AM/FM radio (and extra batteries) on hand as well."

Determine where you will go in the event that you cannot remain in your home or even in your region. Then, map out several routes for getting out of your city and state or region. Be sure to brief all your family members about evacuation strategies and exit plans. It\u2019s important to have multiple options in case roadways are damaged during a disaster."

          "description":"Come up with a communication plan in case you are separated in the event of a disaster. You may want to provide each member of the family with a prepaid cell phone and charger, for instance. Make a contact card for each member of the family so they have all the phone numbers and addresses they may need. Text messages are more reliable than phone calls during emergencies. Make sure children know how to operate a cell phone and send a text message."

          "description":"In case all of your family members aren\u2019t able to reach a designated meeting place, you should have several contingencies. Choose one location in your neighborhood or close to your home as well as one that is located out of town. Plan to meet at the closest location in the event of an emergency, and keep the out-of-town location as a backup in case a disaster prevents you from meeting at the primary location."

Each year, you should do a practice drill for each type of disaster that could occur. For example, conduct a home fire drill if you live in an area prone to drought and wildfire."

Opt for items that don\u2019t require refrigeration, but also those that require little cooking in case you don\u2019t have power due to a disaster. Store 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water per person (and per pet) per day. Don\u2019t forget formula and bottles if you have an infant, as well as pet food for any pets. Tap water may be unsafe to drink in the event of a disaster, so be sure to include plenty of purified water in bottles or jugs. Canned soup, tuna, nuts, dried fruit, beef jerky, nut butter, protein bars, cereal, powdered milk, dry pasta, and packaged crackers are good options. Don\u2019t forget to pack a can opener, utensils, dishes, waterproof matches, and a camp stove, if possible. At the minimum you should have a 3 day supply of food and water ready, but it\u2019s best to store enough for 2 weeks."

You could also include insurance paperwork, immunization records, and a copy of your family emergency plan.
