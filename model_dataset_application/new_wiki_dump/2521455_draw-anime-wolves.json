      "headline":"Begin to add shape.",
      "description":"Draw a nose starting to emerge out of the oval of the head of the wolf you've drawn beforehand, and bumps (paws) on the bottoms of the feet. At this point you can even go as far as dividing up toes. This will tend to look awkward if your anatomy structure is wrong, in which case you will need to edit it so it looks right. This is where references come in handy."

      "headline":"Add action detail to the figure.",
      "description":"If the animal is snarling, begin to add elements to depict this. For hair detail, you can tilt your pencil at an angle, and then began adding streaks of nice lines that mimic fur. Some lines darker in areas where shade is present."
