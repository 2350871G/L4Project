Many building materials are porous and will absorb water if they are left sitting on the ground. Store bricks or cement on pallets and cover them with a waterproof tarp at the end of each night. Implement overhangs, copings, and flashings to minimize water absorption. Including these into the structure you're building will help prevent water from entering the material when it rains. Overhangs extend over a wall so rainwater does not come into contact with the wall. Copings are slanted caps on top of walls so water does not rest on the flat surface.

Form a capillary break between the soil and your building material, either as a sheet of polyethylene or as liquid-applied waterproofing.

Keep water away from an area that may be susceptible to efflorescence. If you have plants next to a porous wall, use a hose and water them directly rather than setting up a sprinkler. Sealing Concrete Purchase a silicate-based concrete sealer. Silicate sealers soak into the concrete and create a hard barrier that is waterproof. They can be painted over once they have dried. You can find these sealants at big box home care stores. Silicate-based sealers do not work on walls or areas that have already been treated or painted over. Wait until the concrete has cured for 30 days. If you are planning on sealing new concrete, wait until it has cured fully, which usually takes around 4 weeks. Silicate and siliconate sealers can be applied as soon as the concrete can support your weight. Apply when temperatures are between 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) or 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C).

If applying the sealer outdoors, check the weather to make sure rain is not expected for the next 24 hours. Use a paint roller or pump sprayer. If you're covering a large area, a sprayer is suggested. Otherwise, use a paint roller with \u00bc in to \u215c in (6.35 mm to 9.5 mm) nap. Apply 2 thin coats of the sealer to the concrete. Allow the first layer of sealer to dry for 2 to 4 hours before applying the second coat. The second coat should be applied in an opposite direction, or perpendicular, to how you put on the first coat. Avoid using too much sealer on one coat or else you will have puddles and bubbling. Allow the sealant to dry for up to 3 days. Try your best to avoid foot or vehicle traffic over your freshly sealed concrete. Areas with heavy traffic should be given the most time, about 3 days, to set before they are walked on again.",
