          "headline":"Lower your in-game settings.",
          "description":"The best way to get a big performance boost from your games is by lowering the graphical settings. This may make the game look a little worse, but can lead to massive gains in frames per second (FPS), which will provide a much smoother experience. Look for some of the following settings in your game's Graphic Options menu for a big impact:\nResolution - Games will look best when they're running at your monitor's native resolution, but you can make a big FPS improvement by dropping the resolution down. The game will look blockier, but should instantly feel smoother. Changing your resolution can give you one of the biggest performance boosts you can get. For example, switching from 1920\u00d71080 to 1600\u00d7900 will often give you about a 20% boost in FPS. Anti-aliasing (AA) - This is the technique that smooths out the pixelated edges on objects, making edges look more natural. There are lots of different AA options (MSAA, FSAA, etc. ), but for now you just need to know that most of them have a big performance cost. Try turning AA off completely and see how your game plays. If you're getting super-smooth performance and want to try some AA, try FXAA if available first, as this is the cheapest AA solution. Also, stick to 2X or 4X solutions. Texture Quality - If you're getting intermittent stuttering while playing (as opposed to a low frame rate), you may want to lower your texture quality. This is especially important when playing newer video games with older video cards. Shadow Quality - Detailed shadows can take a whole lot of processing power, so try dropping your shadow quality to get a major performance boost. V-Sync - This locks the vertical sync to your monitor\u2019s refresh rate which may force the game to run at a lower frame rate. You can disable this setting for a potential speed boost, however it may introduce screen tearing."

This will change the graphics card settings for all programs. Check under the game\u2019s settings to see which video card is being used as the primary display driver. If you have more than one video card installed, changing this setting to your video card that features high performance may resolve the issue.
