  "text":" Making the Shirt Fold bill in half lengthwise across the face of the bill, and then unfold with the head facing up.  With the front of the bill facing down, fold each long edge to the center of the bill.  At the short left edge, fold the white tips of the bill under the bill.  Take the two corners that you folded in the previous step and fold each corner toward the center of the bill to form the collar of the shirt.  Fold the bill into thirds lengthwise, starting at the opposite end of the collar.  Finish folding the bill into thirds. It should be able to tuck under the collar. Unfold the end of the bill. At the 1/3 mark opposite the collar, pull the creases so they are creased the opposite way. This makes the sleeves of the shirt. With the sleeves still poking out, refold the bill into thirds.  Tuck bill under shirt collar and you're done!  Making the Pants Fold bill in half lengthwise, so the crease is horizontal across the face of the bill, head of bill facing up.  With the front of the bill facing down, fold the bill lengthwise with both ends meeting at the center crease.  Fold the bill again lengthwise, so the face shows on both sides.  Fold the bill width-wise. Adjust the two ends of the bill to a 45 degree angle to resemble legs. Bringing it Together Just place the shirt on top of the pants and you have a beautiful money man!  If you're feeling extra fancy, you can top it all off with a coin! ",
