  "text":" Making Chunky Chalk Take a cardboard tube. Cover one end with duct tape or aluminum foil, making sure the tube is sealed tight enough to prevent leakage. Mix your chalk. Mix 3/4 cup warm water with 1 1/2 cups kid-safe plaster of Paris in a disposable cup. Don't be concerned if the amounts are not exact. Mix 3 tablespoons nontoxic liquid tempera paint into the plaster mixture. Repeat these steps for each color of chalk you'd like to make. Place each cardboard tube duct tape side down on a wax paper lined baking sheet. Spoon the plaster mixture into each cardboard tube. Let dry for 24 hours.  Remove the duct tape from the tubes. Let dry an additional 24 hours. Peel the tube off the plaster, once the chalk has completely dried. Make sure the chalk is completely dry before you use it. Making Glow-in-the-Dark Chalk Obtain luminous pigment powder at a craft store, or online.  Get a cardboard tube for each piece of chalk you want to make. Cover one end with duct tape or aluminum foil and seal it to prevent leakage. Mix each chalk color. Mix roughly 3/4 cup warm water with 1 1/2 cups kid-safe plaster of Paris in a disposable cup. Add 1 tablespoon (or more) glow powder into the plaster mixture. Repeat these steps for each color of chalk you'd like to make. Place each cardboard tube covered side down on a baking sheet lined with wax paper. Spoon the chalk mixture into each cardboard tube. Let dry for 24 hours.  Remove the duct tape or foil from the tubes. Let dry an additional 24 hours. Peel the tube off the plaster, once the chalk has completely dried. Make sure the chalk is completely dry before you use it. Expose the chalk to a light source before use. Display the chalk art under a black light for the best results. Making Silly-Shaped Chalk Use a plastic spoon to mix 3/4 cup warm water with 1 cup kid-safe plaster of Paris in a disposable cup.  Add 1/4 cup nontoxic liquid tempera paint into the plaster mixture. Stir well. Pour the mixture into a shaped silicone mold. Clean up the edges with a paper towel. Let dry for 24 hours.  Pop each piece out of the mold carefully. The chalk will still be slightly soft. Let the shapes dry for an additional 24 hours before use.  Creating Quick Chalk Paint Mix one cup of cornstarch and one cup of water until smooth. If it still has a few lumps, it's okay. Just get it as smooth as you can. Divide the mixture into separate cups. You can then add food coloring to each cup to make unique colors. Use paintbrushes to paint chalk art!  Freeze the chalk in ice cube trays to make ice chalk instead, if desired. Make a unique sidewalk chalk for hot summer days. You can also try adding baking soda to the cornstarch mixture.
