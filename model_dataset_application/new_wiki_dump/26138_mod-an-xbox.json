  "text":" Preparing to Mod Ensure that you have a classic Xbox console. These steps will only work for an Xbox console; if you want to mod an Xbox 360 or an Xbox One, the process is different. The classic Xbox was released in November of 2001. Make sure you have access to a Windows computer. Since the files used to create the installation media are exclusive to Windows, you cannot perform this process on a Mac. Download the mod software. Go to https://mega.nz/#!gVkGmKIY!pMsjphysgCWpgk0JCFKqlIbBkTxrxrzVZi2ElH7i9wA in your computer's web browser, then click the red Download button. The software's ZIP folder will begin compiling; after it completes this process, it will download onto your computer. You may have to click Allow in your browser window before the file will begin downloading. Depending on your browser, you may first have to confirm this choice or select a save location before the file will download. Buy a compatible USB flash drive. Modern flash drives won't work when you connect them to your Xbox, but you can buy an older USB 2.0 flash drive in the 2 gigabyte range to use with your Xbox. You can review a list of USB flash drives which will work with your Xbox here. Purchase a USB-to-Xbox adapter. You'll use a USB-to-Xbox adapter cable in order to connect your USB flash drive to your Xbox. These cables can be found on Amazon and eBay, though you may be able to find them in some hobby shops as well. Obtain a copy of Splinter Cell. The original Splinter Cell can be used to access the mod files for your Xbox.

Other games that you can use to mod your Xbox include the original black label version of MechAssault and the original black label version of 007 Agent Under Fire, though the process will differ from Splinter Cell. Formatting Your Flash Drive Plug the adapter into your Xbox. The Xbox end of the adapter cable should plug into one of the slots on the front of the Xbox console. Turn on the Xbox and a controller. You'll need to use your Xbox's menu to format the flash drive. Select MEMORY. It's at the top of the menu. Plug the flash drive into the adapter. Using the free end of the adapter cable, connect the flash drive that you purchased in the previous part; after a few seconds, you should see an error message appear. Confirm the error message.

Now that your flash drive has all of the necessary files on it, you can proceed with adding those files to the Xbox. Adding the Mod Files to Your Xbox Make sure your Xbox doesn't have a disc in it. You'll want your Xbox's disc tray to be empty before proceeding. Plug your flash drive into your Xbox. Do so using the adapter cable from before. Select MEMORY. You'll find this option at the top of the Xbox's main menu. Select your flash drive. It's in one of the controller slots (e.g., Controller 1) in one of the corners of the screen. Select SID5 Splinter Cell NTSC. You'll find this option near the bottom of the screen. Select COPY. Doing so will bring up a list of locations to which you can copy your file. Select the hard drive. Press A when prompted to do so. Select your installer. It should be labelled SID 5.11 Installer USB. Select COPY, then select your hard drive. This will paste the installer onto your Xbox's hard drive. Once the installer is finished pasting, you can proceed with finally modding your Xbox. Modding Your Xbox Place Splinter Cell in the Xbox. Make sure the disc is logo-side-up. Wait for Splinter Cell to load. Once the main Splinter Cell menu loads, you can proceed. Select START GAME. It's near the top of the screen. Select the LINUX profile. This option will be on the left side of the screen. Select CHECKPOINTS. It's in the top-left corner. Doing so will cause your Xbox to begin flashing erratically; a few seconds later, you should see the softmod menu appear on-screen. Back up your Xbox.

Select Create MS Backup\n\nSelect Yes when prompted. Select OK when prompted. Return to the main menu. Press the B button on your controller to do so. Select Install Single Boot Softmod. You'll find this option near the top of the screen. Select Standard. It's at the top of the menu. If you use HD cables with your Xbox, select Standard for HD instead. Select a dashboard. The dashboard version you select doesn't matter, and is purely dependent on your preferences. If you don't have a preference, select Install UnleashX Dashboard here. Select Yes twice when prompted. Doing so causes your Xbox to check for a backup and, as long as there is one, begin installing the mod. Allow the mod to install. The softmod will begin installing once you select Yes the second time. Keep in mind that this process will take a while. Select Yes when prompted. Doing so will immediately shut down your Xbox. Press the \"Eject\" button. This will both prompt Splinter Cell to eject and turn on your console. Once you've ejected Splinter Cell, your console should load to the modded menu.",
