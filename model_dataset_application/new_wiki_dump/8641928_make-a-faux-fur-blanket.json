If the fabric pieces are not the same size, then just line up as many edges as you can. Keep in mind that if you want to use faux fur for both sides of the blanket, then you can. However, it will cost more for the extra faux fur fabric. If using faux fur for both sides, then lay the two faux fur pieces so that the fur sides are facing each other. Other backing fabric options you might use in place of fleece include flannel, satin, cotton, microfiber, and jersey. Just make sure to place the right side (print or texture side) so that it is facing towards the faux fur fabric."

          "description":"Use your scissors to trim either the fleece or faux fur if necessary. It is important for the two pieces to be roughly the same size. Don\u2019t worry too much about a slight difference in the size of the two fabrics or jagged edges. These will be hidden on the inside of the blanket when you sew it. If you need to cut the faux fur fabric, then it is best to do so on the back side (non-furry side) of the fabric and use an exacto knife. This will make it easier to avoid cutting through the fur and ending up with stray hairs everywhere."

Pin all the way around the edges of the blanket except for a roughly 16\u201d section extending from one of the corners. Be sure to use lots of pins to hold the two pieces of fabric together! Place a pin at least every 8 inches along the edges."

Stop sewing when you reach this area. Lift the needle and presser foot so that you can pull the fabric away from the sewing machine. Then, begin inverting the blanket so that the faux fur is on the outside. Keep pulling the fabric through the gap until it is totally inverted. You may need to push out the fabric at the corners a bit to ensure that they don\u2019t look lumpy. Use your fingers or a small object to gently push the fabric out at the corners of the blanket."
