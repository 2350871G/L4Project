          "description":"This is a crucial step. Pictures with dim lighting will look glum. Too bright, and you'll hurt your viewer's eyes, and the food won't look its best. Some cameras  actually have a specific \"food\" setting. Use flash selectively, as it can give your photo a bright, polished look but can appear harsh, too. Flash photography often fails to show food to its best effect. Remember that if you are taking a picture with flash, objects like bowls, plates, and cups will likely show a glare. Shadows may result, too, which may not be desirable. If you want a professional picture, use diffused (reflected) light. Try different exposures for a change in light level. The best food photography is achieved in a studio using bright but diffused lighting. In the absence of a studio, an open, well-lit room will do. The object is to capture every detail of the food, and light is the key. Avoid direct sunlight or any light that casts shadows, which can make food look less natural, less  appealing. Use a light reflector to achieve a generalized and bright look. One exception is using a spotlight while trying for a reflected glare on a curved surface (such as fruit). Shadowing may be desirable if it's used to emphasize the curve of some surfaces. A good shooting location is near a window that admits indirect sunlight. Lighting should complement food colors. Study your camera's ability to affect \"white balance\" in showing a particular color to best effect. Shadow can be used to emphasize angled surfaces (such as with pineapples). Photographing liquids can be tricky because of surface reflections. Place lighting and the camera in such a way as not to let lights reflect off the liquid."

The idea is to place photo subjects at any of the line intersections, thereby creating a more interesting composition. You don't have to include the entire subject within your frame. You can take an extreme close-up for an interesting effect. Just don't get so close that the viewer can't tell what the subject is. Use creative focus. Varying the camera's focal length will allow you to place certain objects in a softer focus in order to emphasize whatever remains in sharp focus."

Experiment by shooting anywhere from directly overhead to slightly below the subject. Take shots from the front, rear and various side angles. Keep looking for interesting ways to show off the food. Round objects can be shown to good effect from directly overhead. Experiment until you find the angle that shows off the subject's natural appeal."
