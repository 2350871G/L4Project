This will release the wand and the hose at the same time. Lift the wand out of the vacuum by pulling the handle directly up and pull the hose out with your other hand. The hose is attached to the bracket with the red button on it. Simply lift the entire piece out of the vacuum to extend the hose."

You will not hear a click or anything since the attachment relies on the tension between the 2 openings to stay in place.Warning: Always hold the wand by the handle, not the tool.
