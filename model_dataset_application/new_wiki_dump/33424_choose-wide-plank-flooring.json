      "headline":"Choose a wood with the hue, grain, and finish that appeals to you and that will enhance the light and d\u00e9cor of your room or home.",
      "description":"The appeal of your new flooring is the most important quality to consider. Visualize whether amber, blond, tan or deeper hues would best show in the room\u2019s light and would best blend with or accent your furnishings. Do you prefer the look of clear wood, planks with exuberant grain, the occasional accent of knots, or a lovely burlington  pattern? Lighter woods like pine, birch, white and red oak, or hickory can open up a smaller room or give a more airy feeling to a dimly-lit room. Darker woods like walnut, stained or deeply-hued woods such as cherry, can look more elegant and formal. They also suit the quiet seriousness of a study or office."

      "headline":"Oak has been the standard for durability, however all solid wood plank flooring is durable.",
      "description":"Each of the many beautiful woods available will last generations. Also, if you select wood harder than oak, whether maple, birch, or ash, it is more of a challenge to finish, and you may want to leave it natural. If you want to adjust the hue of your flooring with stain, select oak, a softer hardwood, or pine. If you are seeking a bright, warm Early American look in your home, wide plank heartwood pine exudes the welcoming, rustic appeal of a lodge."

The beauty of knots or burling will show to greater effect in wider planks. Narrower-width planks with lots of grain or color variation can exactly complement a smaller room but look busy in a large room."

Make a mental picture of the sample, then look out across your room and imagine it covered in that wide plank flooring. By working with each sample and sensing your responses to it, you soon will know the wood or woods that hold the most appeal for you."
