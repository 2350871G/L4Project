Re-cork properly by inserting the cork into the bottle in the same direction as when you pulled it out. Avoid putting the \u201cclean\u201d side of the cork into the bottle facing the wine, even if it seems easier to do so, as it may not be clean and could in fact contaminate the wine. If you don\u2019t have a cork or stopper available to seal your wine bottle, use a small piece of plastic wrap to cover the mouth of the bottle, then secure with a rubber band."

Don\u2019t store the wine bottle horizontally on its side once opened, whether on a rack or in the refrigerator. This will expose a greater surface area of the wine to oxygen. Note that keeping wine in the refrigerator will not keep it from going bad, but it can slow down the chemical process responsible for making the wine lose its flavor.

Murphy Perng\t\t\tCertified Wine Consultant\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: To keep a bottle of wine after it's been opened, re-cork it tightly and place it back into the fridge. However, once the wine touches the air, it will begin to lose its fruit and freshness quickly, so it's best to finish an opened bottle within 2-3 days."

Place the bottle in lukewarm water, or simply bring it out of the fridge about an hour before serving."

Make sure your half bottle of leftover wine is sealed tightly with an appropriate cork, stopper, or screw-top. Save empty half bottles, which you can often find when buying dessert wines, and reuse over and over again for this purpose. If you don\u2019t have any half bottles on hand, you can use another small glass container that seals tightly."

You may want to invest in this device if you frequently have opened bottles of wine to keep, or drink varieties particularly prone to oxygenating, like full-bodied white wines such as oaked Chardonnay or Viognier. Note that there is some disagreement about the effectiveness of wine vacuums. Some say that the oxygen removal is only partial, or it can actually damage the flavor of the wine due to extracting its aromas as well as the oxygen."

Don\u2019t use a vacuum pump on sparkling wine bottles, as it will suck out the carbonation of the wine. Some people enjoy day-old sparkling wine like champagne more than when it\u2019s freshly opened, due to the slight decrease in carbonation and rounding out of flavors.

Fortified wines can keep for longer due to the addition of brandy, or sugars in the case of dessert wines. Keep them for up to 28 days with a cork in the fridge. Keep boxed wine in the fridge and continue drinking from it for two to three weeks. Pay attention to and don\u2019t drink beyond the given expiration date, as it is provided based on regulations for food stored in plastic. Another method of keeping any wine for a very long time is to freeze it for use in cooking. Freeze wine into cubes or a block and keep it in the freezer in an airtight container for up to four to six months."
