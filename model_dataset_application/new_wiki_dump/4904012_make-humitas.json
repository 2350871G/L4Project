      "description":"Peel the corn and set the cornhusks aside. Cut off the kernels and use them to make a puree. You can use a grater to grate the corn by hand and thus make a puree. Or you can put the kernels in a food processor and allow this device to turn them into a puree."

    {
      "headline":"Season the puree.",
      "description":"Put the mashed kernels in a bowl and add milk, basil, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir the mixture for a few seconds until all of the ingredients are evenly mixed. If you want to make sweet humitas, leave out the salt and add sugar in its place. Since the corn is already somewhat sweet, you don't need to add too much sugar to sweeten the mixture."

    {
      "headline":"Saut\u00e9 the rest of the ingredients.",
      "description":"In an oiled pan, saut\u00e9 the onion and pepper. Once the onion becomes translucent, add the diced tomato and cook over low heat. This mixture should be dry, so cook it over low heat until the juices have evaporated."

    {
      "headline":"Prepare the humita filling.",
      "description":"Add the saut\u00e9ed ingredients to the corn puree. Stir well in order to create a creamy and uniform filling. If you want to use cheese in your humitas, this is the time to add it to the mixture."

      "headline":"Fill the cornhusks.",
      "description":"Place one husk on top of another, forming an X. In the center, place one and a half tablespoons of the filling. Close the husks by making a small, firm packet so that the filling will not come out. Tie the packet with the ends of the husks or with string."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Cook the humitas.",
      "description":"In a pot, heat enough water to cook all of the humitas. Once the water has boiled, lower the heat and add the humitas one by one. Cook them for approximately 45 minutes."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Serve.",
      "description":"When they are done cooking, remove the humitas and place them in a strainer. Let them rest for 5 minutes. The humitas should be served warm, but not too hot, because your guests could burn themselves when opening the packet."
