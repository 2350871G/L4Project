You can also texture the ceiling by adding materials to either latex or oil based paint. Purchase material that is meant for texturing paint, such as special sand, and mix it according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, as well as your own preference. Generally, you will mix 1 part of the additive to every ten parts of paint. This works out to roughly 1 \u00bd cups of texture for every gallon of paint."
