          "description":"The bobbin is a small spool of thread that is loaded underneath your needle and it supplies the thread that comes up through the base of your machine. This thread connects with the thread on your needle and forms stitches. To wind the bobbin, insert the thread through the hole in your spool and then wind it around the bobbin a couple of times. Then, place the bobbin onto the small spool pin so that it is locked into place. Place your thread on the larger spool. Then, slowly apply pressure to your pedal and watch the bobbin wind with thread. Stop the pedal when the bobbin is nearly full. If you have pre-threaded bobbins, then you do not have to worry about threading a bobbin."

If you have your manual, then be sure to check your machine\u2019s specific instructions for loading the bobbin.

Then, pull a piece of thread away from the spool and bring it across the top of the machine, and down through the first slot.

You can find the stitch setting by checking the knob or digital display on your sewing machine. Turn the knob or select a new stitch setting on your digital display to change the stitch setting. The basic stitch that most patterns call for is a straight stitch, which is setting number one on most machines. However, be sure to check your manual to find out if this is correct, and whether you need to make any other adjustments to use a specific stitch setting. For example, your machine may automatically adjust the tension for you, or you may need to adjust the tension manually depending on the type of machine you have."

This will make the needle move and the teeth on your machine will move the fabric forward as you sew. Use your fingers to guide the fabric as you apply gentle pressure, but keep them away from the needle. Make sure that the pedal is somewhere that is easy for you reach and that will be comfortable for you to apply pressure to. If the fabric is going to fast or if the stitches look sloppy, then stop the machine and make adjustments. Most sewing manuals come with troubleshooting sections to help you solve problems. However, you can also go back through the threading process, check the tension on your machine, and check the stitch setting to find a solution."
