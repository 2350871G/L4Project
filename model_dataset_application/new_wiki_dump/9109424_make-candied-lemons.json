Try to use organic lemons since these haven't been sprayed with pesticides and you'll be eating the peels."

Leave the lemon slices in the ice water until they're cold. This should take a few minutes. Blanching the lemon slices will soften them, but stop them from cooking so they keep their bright yellow color."

The syrup should be bubbling gently. Simmer the slices for 1 hour so the rinds become clear and the lemons are soft. You can stir the lemons occasionally to help them cook evenly, but ensure that they stay in a single layer."

Let them sit out until they're completely cool. You may want to lay a sheet of waxed paper underneath the rack to catch any syrup that drips."
