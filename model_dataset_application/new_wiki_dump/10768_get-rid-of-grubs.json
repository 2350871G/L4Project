A few grubs aren't actually going to hurt your lawn or cause too much cosmetic damage, especially if your lawn is healthy. There is no need to take action to get rid of the grubs if you find fewer than five per square foot. If you find more than five but fewer than 10 grubs per square foot, you'll only need to treat your lawn if your grass isn't healthy. Regardless of the state of your lawn, you'll need to get rid of the grubs if you find more than 10 per square foot."

It\u2019s important to note, however, that this is a long-term method, and it can take the worms up to three years to fully control your grub problem. For the best results, apply the beneficial nematodes in the late afternoon, and water the lawn immediately after applying them. Because beneficial nematodes need to invade the bodies of grubs in order to propagate, you must choose between using this method or using a chemical pesticide. These worms may be sold under the name Hb nematodes, and you can buy them through gardening stores, catalogues, and online."

Because it\u2019s a spore, it comes in the form of a powder that you can sprinkle on your lawn to get rid of grubs. Like the worms, using Bacillus popilliae to get rid of grubs is a long-term solution, rather than a quick fix. To use Bacillus popilliae, you can spray it onto your lawn with water, or sprinkle the dry powder onto your grass. Like the beneficial nematodes, you'll have to choose between using Bacillus popilliae or chemical pesticides, because the spores won\u2019t work without a grub population. A Japanese beetle grub can be distinguished from other grubs by the end of its body. Whereas most grub bodies end in a rounded stump, the Japanese beetle grub has a pointed end."

By seeding and fertilizing your lawn, you can repair any damage the grubs have done and deter new beetles from laying more eggs. In spring and fall, rake away dead grass from any brown patches.

Beetle eggs will die without water, so starving them of it will kill the eggs before they even hatch into grubs. Many grubs lay eggs in July, so it\u2019s especially important to keep your lawn dry in July and August. Beetles will also avoid laying eggs in a dry lawn, so you should consider not watering your lawn in the last week of June as well."
