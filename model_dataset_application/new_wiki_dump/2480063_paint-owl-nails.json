Decide which nails you want to put owls on. In this article, owls are painted on the thumb and ring finger, but you can paint them on all of your nails, or as many as you want. Draw the owl's body with a dark color; plum was used here. Start out with a large bar that goes across the bottom of the nail. Then draw two ears on either sides. You can use the nail polish brush at first and then take a detail brush to make the body more rounded and the ears nice and pointy. Allow the body to dry for a few minutes.  Draw on the owl's belly. Using the nail polish brush, take a lighter color (here it is shown as blue) and draw a semi circle at the bottom of your nail. Add the eyes. Take a dotter tool and the base color (nude) polish and dot two eyes above the belly. Add pupils. Take the body color (plum) and dot on the pupils. Now you're done with the owl's eyes. Add the nose.
