A moka pot, also called a macchinetta, is a small stove-top coffee maker. To make espresso in the moka pot:\nFill the bottom chamber with the water, being sure not to surpass the maximum fill line. Place the metal filter basket inside the bottom reservoir, and fill it with the coffee. Screw on the top chamber. Close the lid and heat the moka pot over medium heat. As the water in the bottom chamber heats up, it will be forced up through the coffee and into the upper chamber. When the moka pot starts sputtering, lift the lid. Leave the pot on the heat until the coffee stops bubbling up. Remove the pot from the heat."

          "description":"An AeroPress is a type of coffee press that you can use to make an espresso-type drink. To use the AeroPress for espresso instead of coffee:\nInsert a new filter in the strainer and assemble the AeroPress. Pour in a little water to wet the filter, and then position the AeroPress over a coffee mug. Pour in the coffee. Boil your water in a kettle or a saucepan, and when it boils, pour the water over the coffee. Stir the coffee, and then insert the plunger slightly. Pull the plunger back a little, but not enough to remove it from the column. Let the coffee brew for two minutes, and then apply gentle and even pressure to the plunger to push the coffee through the filter. Continue pushing the plunger all the way to the bottom, even when it starts hissing, so you get the crema for the espresso."
