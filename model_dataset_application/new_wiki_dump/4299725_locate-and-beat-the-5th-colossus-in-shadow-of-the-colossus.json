  "text":" Locate the Fifth Colossus Head outside the shrine and call Agro with X. When she\u2019s beside you, mount her by pressing \u2206. Take out your sword with O and turn left. The beams should centralize on the east side of the shrine. Ride towards the area where the beams centralized. You'll notice there's a ravine and a small path beside it (near the place you entered through while going to the fourth colossus). Pass through the small path near the ravine. Keep going forward, through the winding path, until you see another path between the mountains. Enter and walk through this path until you see some ruins. Dismount Agro and dive into the water.  Swim your way to the collapsed wall. Press R1 to dive underwater and go through it. Go towards the wall and scale it by pressing \u2206. Press R1 to grab on the ledge. Go forward and up the set of stairs. A cutscene will play showing you the fifth colossus. Go through the small hole in the fence that surrounds the area you're standing on.  Swim forward until you see a set of small square stones.  Take out your bow and fire an arrow at the colossus. This will cause Avion to fly up to the skies. Prepare for battle! Defeat the Fifth Colossus Stand still on the block that you're standing on. Avion will try to swoop down on you. You'll immediately notice that there's a patch of climbable fur on each side of its wings. Wait for it to go near you and jump toward one of its wings. Grab onto the fur. This may sound easy, but the timing for it is horrendously hard to get, and you'll probably end up in the water more than half a dozen times, but keep going until you get the timing correctly. Another thing that makes this hard is, if you miss the timing, there's a possibility that Avion will hit you and cause a lot of damage, so be cautious! Climb your way on top of Avion. It'll put up a fight and hysterically fly around. Once Avion settles, down run down its back and grab onto its tail. Charge up your sword and stab Avion's first weak point until it disappears. Be careful not to fall off while doing this, and watch your stamina. Climb back toward Avion's head after the first weak point disappears. Grab its fur near the wings, and make your way through its right wing; the second weak point will be there. Be extremely careful while transferring from the body to the wings as Avion will fly violently, leaving you only a small amount of time to get there. Stab the weak point with a fully charged strike. Do this only once! The weak point will immediately disappear, and stabbing it after the weak point disappears will cause Avion to go crazy. Transfer from the right wing to the left wing.

Stab the last weak point. Avion will fall down and die.",
