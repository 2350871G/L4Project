Not every restaurant is willing to take reservations, even if they are consistently busy. For example, some smaller or newer restaurants may not have enough clientele yet to set up a system for reservations. So it's important to know a restaurant's policy before you try to book a table."

          "description":"Once you've chosen a restaurant, figure out how many people are going to go to dinner with you. Depending on the size of your party, your wait time may vary. For example, if there are only two of you, you are more likely to have an easier time getting a table. On the other hand, if you are trying to book a table for a party of 10, it's going to be much more difficult. The number of people in your party may also affect how far ahead you need to book your reservation. If you are unsure whether or not a person will be able to make it, book a table including them anyways. It's easier to have an empty seat rather than trying to add a chair to a table in a crowded restaurant."

Similarly, setting a reservation for \u201coff-hours\u201d rather than the regular \u201cprime time\u201d hours for breakfast, lunch, or dinner will make getting a reservation easier. You should always have a backup date and time in case there is no availability at the original time you chose."

Be confident but polite; avoid giving the impression that you feel entitled to a reservation. However, remember that even Michelin-starred restaurants are not in the business of turning away customers. If the host replies that the restaurant has no availability, explain your situation and ask politely if there is any way you can be accommodated in the future. When calling say, \"Hi, I'd like to place a reservation for this coming Saturday at 5.\" The host will then likely ask how many people are in your party and tell you if that time and date is available. If it's not available, try asking \"Is there a table available for an earlier/later time?\" If the answer is still no, ask if they can give you their earliest availability and go from there."

You should do this as early in the day as you can in case there is a problem. This will allow you to make other plans if you need to, or give you time to work out the problem with the restaurant."

If you are running much later than that, consider canceling and rescheduling your dinner. Remember that reservations are made for a reason - to make sure as many guests as possible are served on each night. If you are late it affects other guests' reservations."

Many restaurants will have a bar or waiting area that you can sit in and get drinks.
