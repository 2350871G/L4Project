          "description":"Go to a lumber yard, a construction supply store, or a home improvement store to buy a piece of 4x4 wood. If you have some wood already, use that, even if you don\u2019t have a single piece that\u2019s 20 inches long. If you use multiple pieces, be sure to have at least 20 inches. Note that \u201c4x4\u201d is a standard measurement for a size of wood boards. The boards don\u2019t always measure exactly four inches by four inches. If you want to create dice that are larger or smaller than a 4x4 inch square, you can use a different size of wood. However, a 4x4 is easiest to use because it is a standard board size."

          "description":"Since 4x4s are not always exactly measured,  use a measuring tape to check the length of each side. At the end of the piece of wood, measure two adjacent sides of the square. For example, the board may be 3.8 inches (9.6 cm) by 3.8 inches."

          "headline":"Measure a length for each die.",
          "description":"Using the exact measurement of the board, mark off sections for 5 dice. For example, if your board measured 3.8x3.8, add a little bit to the measurement to account for the width of the saw blade and make marks on the board every four inches. With these measurements, you\u2019ll have five equal sections of board. Saw blades tend to be about \u215b inch or \u00bc inch thick, so you lose some of the board when you make the cuts. Marking the board every four inches will give you sections that are roughly 3.8 inches long after the cut."

  "text":" Cutting Wood Cubes for Dice Get a piece of 4x4 wood that is at least 20 inches (50 cm) long. Go to a lumber yard, a construction supply store, or a home improvement store to buy a piece of 4x4 wood. If you have some wood already, use that, even if you don\u2019t have a single piece that\u2019s 20 inches long. If you use multiple pieces, be sure to have at least 20 inches. Note that \u201c4x4\u201d is a standard measurement for a size of wood boards. The boards don\u2019t always measure exactly four inches by four inches. If you want to create dice that are larger or smaller than a 4x4 inch square, you can use a different size of wood. However, a 4x4 is easiest to use because it is a standard board size. Measure the wood. Since 4x4s are not always exactly measured,  use a measuring tape to check the length of each side. At the end of the piece of wood, measure two adjacent sides of the square. For example, the board may be 3.8 inches (9.6 cm) by 3.8 inches. Measure a length for each die. Using the exact measurement of the board, mark off sections for 5 dice. For example, if your board measured 3.8x3.8, add a little bit to the measurement to account for the width of the saw blade and make marks on the board every four inches.

Using an electric saw will give you the straightest cut in the shortest time. Use a circular saw or a chop saw. If power tools are not available, use a hand saw but make sure to keep the cut as straight as possible. Creating Dice From the Cubes Use sandpaper or a power sander to give the cubes a smooth finish.

Setting Up the Game Make a Yahtzee scorecard on a dry erase board. Use a large dry erase board to draw out the template of a classic Yahtzee scorecard.

At the start of every turn, dump the dice on the ground all at once or throw them one at a time. Look for possible groupings based on the scorecard.
