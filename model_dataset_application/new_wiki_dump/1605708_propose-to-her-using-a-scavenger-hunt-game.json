      "headline":"Give each group a list of the things they should accomplish for the scavenger hunt.",
      "description":"Extend your hunting grounds by making them go to unfamiliar territory. This should buy you more time to decorate the place, set up a table of champagne and strawberries, change into your best clothes or other things you need to do before she gets to her final task. Tell each group they can\u2019t move on to the next task without finishing the task before it; of course, the only group who\u2019ll be doing this strictly is the group she belongs to. Instruct them to take pictures or videos of them doing the task so they have proof. Here is an example of a scavenger hunt list:\nGo to the park and make a stranger tell you you\u2019re beautiful or handsome without telling them you\u2019re playing a game. At least two persons from the group should do this (2/3) to proceed to the next task. From the park, buy two hot dogs and then proceed to the nearest mall with three floors. On the ground level of the mall, find a couple and have them eat the hot dogs. Wait for them to finish eating the hot dogs before proceeding to the second floor of the mall. On the second level of the mall, find a clothing store and have a male member of the group try on a woman\u2019s clothing or a female member try on men\u2019s clothing \u2013 it should be whole attire. Ask a saleslady if it looks good on you, if she says \u201cno,\u201d the group may proceed to the next task. If she says yes, change into something else then ask a different saleslady until you get a \u201cno\u201d for an answer. Go to the third level of the mall, look for a girl or a boy wearing pink and have two members in their team take a picture with him or her. Don\u2019t forget to get the photos printed. Go down to the second level of the mall and look for the saleslady whom you got to say \u201cno\u201d and ask her to sign the photos. Go down the ground level and find someone who would be willing to accept the photos and keep them. Outside the mall, all three members of the group should ask a stranger for a quarter. Keep the quarters afterwards as you will need them. At the nearest museum, each of the members needs to ask three strangers for their names and mobile phone numbers. Outside the museum, look for the nearest payphone and use the quarters to call the numbers you gathered. Ask the person on the other end if he/she\u2019s the guy/girl you met in the museum, do 10 push ups in front of the payphone for every fake number you called. Go to the nearest public toilet and change into formal attire. Have your photo taken in front of the public toilet\u2019s entrance, then proceed to the next area."
