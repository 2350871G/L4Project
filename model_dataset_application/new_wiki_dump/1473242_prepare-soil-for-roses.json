      "description":"Clay soil will hold water but does not drain well. It is usually highly alkaline and will need a lot of organic matter added to it. Adding gypsum will improve clay soil and ensure good drainage. Sandy soil will drain well but requires frequent watering. It will also need to be amended with organic material. Very organic soil is usually highly acidic and will have both good drainage and moisture retention. You may need to add lime to increase the pH level.

      "description":"This is the soil usually found in woods and forests. Test your soil with a home kit or send it to a soil testing lab in your area. You can raise the pH level by adding lime if the soil is too acidic. If it is too alkaline, add garden sulfur. If your roses grow poorly and have yellowing leaves, it may indicate that your soil is too alkaline."
