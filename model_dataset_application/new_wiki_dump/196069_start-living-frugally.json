It\u2019s important to incorporate the future and potential crises into your financial planning. Populate an emergency fund in a high interest money market or at least in a savings account with your current bank. Then forget about it. If you have already done that, then jumpstart your 401(k)/403(b) for retirement. If you are already maxing that out, then drop it into an index fund (that is, a low-overhead, lower risk investment in all the securities associated with a particular stock index, such as the S&P 500).

It might be frightening to have so much money taken out of your account immediately each month, but it is far better to scrape by until you adjust than to miss a payment here and/or there and have your credit report take a hit from late or non-payment. Automatic payments will also help you immediately judge how much you have left over for variable expenses in your monthly your budget.

Avoid using credit cards with high, variable interest rates. If your credit card has more than 15% APR, shop around for a better deal. Avoid putting purchases on credit cards if you know that you will not be able to pay them off within your monthly payment period. If you need to spend more than you can pay, consider transferring the balance to a new credit card with an introductory rate of 0%APR for 12-18 months and free balance transfers for 6 or more months. Then, pay off the balance as soon as you can before the interest kicks in. If you have a mortgage or other sizable loan, try to overpay a bit each month.

Look for products that will give you the most bang for your buck, not the ones that are the least expensive. Besides first-hand experience, the easy way to gauge the relative value of products is to read consumer reviews associated with each of your options to assess their comparative quality and customer satisfaction."

          "description":"While not all price tags are negotiable, you\u2019d be surprised at how many costs and payments are. Used goods, service agreements, insurances, rents, fees, benefits, salaries, and wages are all generally subject to negotiation. Approach the proceedings with confidences, firmness, and fairness, and you\u2019ll often come out ahead. Service agreements, such as communications services, credit card contracts, and even medical bills, are often negotiable. For instance, you could call a credit card company and say: \u201cHi, I recently received an offer for a card from another company with a low, fixed APR. Since I\u2019ve been a longtime customer with you, I was wondering if you could match that rate. If not, I\u2019ll have to go with the new company.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re worried about attempting negotiations, try practicing in low-stakes venues where haggling is normal, like flea markets or estate sales. Ask the vendors questions like: \u201cAre you flexible on that price?\u201d or \u201cWould you accept $60 cash for that chair?\u201d\nInformed negotiators generally fare better. Do a little research into the market so that you have a better sense of what a good deal or fair cost would be. If you can say something like, \u201cthe Crain Dealership is offering this same car in the same condition but with fewer miles for $1000 less,\u201d it makes your case more compelling. Be ready to walk away. To be a successful negotiator, you have to be ready to leave behind a bad deal. For example, if your credit card provider is not willing to reduce your APR to match that of a competitor, just say: \u201cAlright, then can you please terminate my account?\u201d"
