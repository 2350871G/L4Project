Ideal catalogs for this craft include any catalog that contains pictures of plants or flowers. You will also need a sheet of blank or construction paper (preferably brown so that it looks like soil), scissors, glue or tape. You could also use white paper, and use coloring pencils or markers to draw on soil, grass, sky and trees, etc. Comb through all of the selected catalogs carefully.
