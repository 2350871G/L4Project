          "description":"Shrinky Dinks are usually sold as 8-inch by 10-inch plastic sheets. Use colored pencils,  markers, and ink on Shrinky Dinks. Use the colored pencil on the rough side of the sheets, and use Sharpie or permanent marker on the smooth side. Some Shrinky Dinks come pre-cut and with designs already outlined on them, and others will just be the plastic sheets. Don\u2019t use oily or waxy substances like crayons or oil paint on Shrinky Dinks because they will melt in high heat. Some sheets are machine-sanded frosted sheets that usually come in packs of 10. Some Shrinky Dinks come as non-sanded sheets, though; that version requires permanent markers. Printing from a computer directly onto a sheet is also possible, and works great with photos. Print letters in a mirror image so they can be read from the nicer shiny side once shrunk. Tracing is popular as well."

Use paper punches if you want holes in the plastic. You might want holes if you are making jewelry or just for decoration. Punch any holes before you bake the Shrinky Dinks. Cut out your design with decorative or regular scissors."

Once the oven is preheated, put the tray with the Shrinky Dinks into the oven. You only need to bake them for 1 to 3 minutes. At first the Shrinky Dinks will curl up, but they will flatten back out. Once they flatten back out, bake for 30 more seconds."

However, this step may not be necessary. Let the Shrinky Dinks cool for a few minutes before handling them. The finished piece will shrink to 1/3 the original\u2019s size, but it will become 9 times thicker. The artwork will be brighter and bolder, and you can more easily preserve it."

Making Homemade Plastic Designs Obtain a piece of #6 plastic. For example, this is the kind of plastic often used in salad bar containers. Look for a \u201c6\u201d on the bottom of the plastic.
