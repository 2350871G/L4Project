          "description":"Whether you\u2019re looking at a printed stereogram or one on your computer monitor, get as close to the image as you comfortably can. Don\u2019t worry about focusing on it; in fact, try to look through the image, not at it. It's usually easier to view the stereogram in printed form rather than on a monitor, so if you're having trouble seeing it on your computer, print out a copy to work with instead. If you normally wear glasses or contact lenses to help with your vision, wear them when you look at the stereogram."

          "description":"As you move away from the stereogram, your natural instinct will be to try to focus on the image. Keep your eyes from doing so by continuing to look through the image as you step back. If your eyes start to focus on the image at any point, move closer to the stereogram again, and repeat the process. Don\u2019t get discouraged if your eyes keep managing to focus on the image as you back up. It\u2019s normal for it to take several tries before you get it right. It can help to pretend that the stereogram is a window and you're trying to look at something through it to avoid focusing on the image itself."

Continue to look at the blurry 3D image at the same distance and in the same position. It will eventually sharpen and come into focus. Remember to have patience. It can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes for your eyes to naturally bring the hidden stereogram image into focus. If you lose focus on the image at any point, repeat the process from the beginning to refocus your eyes."

Even though you\u2019re holding the stereogram, make sure to focus exclusively on the object that you\u2019ve chosen. The object that you focus on doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be right at eye level, but it\u2019s best not to choose an item that\u2019s too high or low. You should be able to look at it comfortably while standing. Make sure that the item isn't too small either because it may be more difficult to focus on a smaller object. The easier it is to maintain your focus on the item, the better chance you'll have of seeing the stereogram image."

However, you should still keep your focus on the object, not the stereogram. If you find yourself switching your focus to the stereogram, start the process over again. When the stereogram is blocking the object that you're focusing on, you should be trying to look \"through\" it. That will keep you from focusing on the stereogram, so your eyes are ready to see the 3D image."

At the right distance, if you keep your gaze focused on the object, the hidden image in the stereogram will appear. The hidden image will likely be blurry at first. Continue looking at it at the same distance until the image eventually becomes sharp and clear."

This can be a difficult thing to master, but it should be similar to what happens when you\u2019ve been reading for a long time and your eyes can no longer focus on the words. If you\u2019re having trouble relaxing your eyes, try \u201cdaydreaming\u201d as you look at the stereogram. That can often help you naturally unfocus your gaze. If you relax your eyes, they naturally look apart, which is why the images you see are blurry.
