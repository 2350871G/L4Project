Popular choices include roses, daises, orchids, mums, and Queen Anne's lace but you can try any pale colored flower."

Use a pair of gardening shears or sharp scissors to cut an inch or two off the stem 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) at a 45-degree angle. At this time, remove any extra leaves that you don't want. This will allow for optimal water absorption, expediting the overall time it takes your flowers to change color. After picking your flowers you can leave them sitting out without water for a couple of hours. They will get thirsty and once you cut the stems and put them in your dye solution they will absorb the color pretty quick."
