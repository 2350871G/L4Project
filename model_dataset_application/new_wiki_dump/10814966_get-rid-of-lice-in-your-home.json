Be sure to focus on the areas where the treated person lays his or her head, and don\u2019t forget to vacuum in the corners and along the edges of the mattress.

As a further precaution, you can put pillowcases or plastic bags over the headrests to prevent lice from spreading to your hair or your passengers\u2019 hair. If you have a child who sits in a carseat or booster seat, take off the seat cover and put it in the dryer on high heat for 40 minutes, or seal in a plastic bag for 5 days. If your car has a leather interior, you can use wipes or a damp cloth to wipe down the seats and headrests."
