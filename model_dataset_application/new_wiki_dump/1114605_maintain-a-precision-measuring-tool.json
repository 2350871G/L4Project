      "description":"Temperature does have a substantial impact on the measuring results. Precise measurement of work pieces should be carried out only under the condition that the temperature is around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F). Generally, measurements can be carried out under room temperature, but the work pieces and the measuring tools should share the same temperature. Otherwise, the result of measurements will not be accurate due to the characteristic of distortion of metals subject to temperature changes. Precision measuring tools are subject to the changes of temperature, too. They should not be put under direct sunshine, because measurements will not be achieved when the temperature rises. Never put precision measuring tools near heat sources such as electric cooker and heat transmitter to protect the tools from being distorted by heat thus disabling accuracy."
