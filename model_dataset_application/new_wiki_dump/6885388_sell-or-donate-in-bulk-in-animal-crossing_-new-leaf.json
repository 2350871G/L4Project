While you can only stack bells in all the games and and fruit in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, this can be useful when conducting trades with your friends. Just drag the individual items into one slot. Bells can be stacked near-indefinitely, but in increments. You can\u2019t stack a 100 bell coin  into a 1000 bell \u201cbag,\u201d but you can stack 10 units of 100 bell coins until you get 1000 bells. Fruit can be stacked into \u201cbunches\u201d of nine, taking up a single slot for every bunch."
