Before removal, turn off the blanket and unplug it. The control cord should never be submerged in water. Before cleaning the blanket, check to make sure that all of the wire heating elements within the blanket are positioned as they should be, and that none of them have worn through the blanket\u2019s fabric. If the wire heating element has worn through the fabric in any location, or the connection point between the blanket and the control cord is damaged in any way, discontinue use of the blanket. If you have an older electric blanket with a control cord that is not detachable, do not wash it in a washing machine. Instead, carefully hand wash the blanket, taking care not to submerge the control cord."
