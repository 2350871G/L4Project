Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to heat fully. Keep an eye on your oven so you\u2019re aware when it reaches the proper temperature.

Line the pan with parchment paper that has some overlap on the sides to serve as a \u201chandle\u201d when you remove the brownies. Next, lightly grease the parchment paper with butter. You can substitute foil for the parchment paper if you prefer. Grease it as you would the parchment paper. You can also grease the parchment paper with nonstick cooking spray."

Microwave the mixture on high in 30 second intervals for 1 \u00bd to 2 minutes. Stir the mixture after each interval, and stop when it is completely melted and smooth. Be sure to work in no more than 30 second intervals. The chocolate can burn easily if you heat it for too long. If you don\u2019t have a microwave, melt the chocolate and butter in a double boiler on the stove. Place them in a heatproof bowl, and set the bowl inside a saucepan full of simmering water on medium or medium-high heat. Mix the chocolate and butter until they\u2019re melted."
