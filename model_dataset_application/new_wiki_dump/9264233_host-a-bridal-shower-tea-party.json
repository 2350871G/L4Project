Ask the bride\u2019s friends or family to help you draw up the guest list. Bridal shower guest lists usually include the bride\u2019s closest friends and family, as well as the groom\u2019s friends or family. Keep in mind you do not need to invite everyone on the wedding guest list to the bridal shower. Just make sure everyone invited to the bridal shower is also invited to the wedding. You may have a cap on how many people you can host at the bridal shower. Most bridal showers have around 30 people for a larger party and as small as 10-15 people for a more intimate party."

If you are hosting the party in your home, you may need to move furniture around or put items away to make space for your guests. Try walking through your home to see how easy it is for others to move around. Designate a few small tables for food and drinks, and set up chairs for guests to sit. If you have a larger guest list, such as 30 people or more, you may decide to host the bridal shower at a venue other than your home. You may look into renting a community hall or reserving tables at a local restaurant, especially if it has a garden."
