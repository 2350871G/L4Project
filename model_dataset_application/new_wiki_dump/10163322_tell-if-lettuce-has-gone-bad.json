When the dark spots appear on multiple leaves in place of these colors, your lettuce is on its way out. Discolored lettuce often feels slimy and smells bad as well. Small brown spots usually aren\u2019t harmful if you eat them. You can also cut around them if the rest of the lettuce leaf is still healthy."

The rotten smell will be very unpleasant, so it is easy to detect. The smell will be so off-putting that you won\u2019t want to eat the lettuce anyway, but it is often accompanied by discoloration and slime on the leaves."

These leaves may not yet feel wet, but the lettuce is still near spoiling when it begins to wilt. Lettuce wilts right before it begins to turn brown. You will have to discard it or find a use for it right away. Wilted lettuce is safe to eat if it hasn\u2019t begun rotting. You can try soaking it in ice water for up to 30 minutes, which may restore its crispness."

Leave them intact and place them in a cool, dry spot in your refrigerator. Heads of lettuce last around 10 days when stored this way. A vegetable crisper is a great place to store heads of lettuce, but not all refrigerators have this drawer. You can also wrap the lettuce in paper towels to absorb damaging moisture. Keep lettuce away from ethylene-producing fruit such as bananas and tomatoes."

Set the leaves on top of the paper towels, then cover them with more paper towels. The paper towels absorb moisture, keeping the lettuce crisper for longer. Seal the storage container when you are done. This will help keep out harmful moisture and gas. However, unsealed lettuce will still survive well in a crisper. You may want to do this for pre-cut lettuce in a bag as well. Moisture can\u2019t escape the closed bag, so the lettuce may rot faster than you would like."

If this isn\u2019t possible, stick the lettuce on the front end of a shelf away from ethylene-producing fruits like bananas and tomatoes. Lettuce leaves usually last up to 5 days but may last longer if stored properly. Be careful when storing lettuce in the back of the refrigerator. Not only does this make forgetting about the lettuce easier, but the cold from the freezer can damage the lettuce. You can also move the container of lettuce to the freezer. Since lettuce has a lot of water in it, it won\u2019t stay crisp, but you can still use it for cooking."

You may be able to keep your lettuce fresher for longer this way. While changing out the paper towels, take the time to pick out any wilted or decaying leaves so they don\u2019t spoil the rest of the batch."

Try to wash only as much lettuce as you need so that the rest of the lettuce doesn\u2019t have excess moisture lingering on it. Moisture causes lettuce to soften and decay, so you want to avoid it as much as possible. You may rinse the lettuce off under running water, but lettuce is delicate and may bruise. Bruised or damaged leaves tend to decay faster."

Spin them until they are completely dry. You can also pat the lettuce with a paper towel or roll it up in a towel to gently squeeze out the moisture."
