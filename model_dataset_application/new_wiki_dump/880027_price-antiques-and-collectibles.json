          "description":"Appraisers can give you several different kinds of price values, depending on how (or if) you want to sell your item. Auction Value \u2013 The auction value is the amount that your item would be expected to sell for at an auction. Very rare or valuable items are often sold at auction because people are willing to spend more. However, items that are less rare or valuable tend to go for less at auction than they would at retail price, because there is not much demand for them. Retail Value \u2013 Retail value is the amount of money your item would sell for in an antique store. If your item is not rare and you don\u2019t expect its value to be high, the retail value is likely to be higher than the auction value. Remember, though, that an antique dealer will not buy your item from you at full retail value; if they did, they wouldn\u2019t be able to make a profit. Insurance Value \u2013 If you decide that you don\u2019t want to sell your item, an appraiser can also assess its insurance value. This is the amount of money that you would need to replace your item in a \u201creasonable amount of time\u201d if it is destroyed or stolen. This is useful is your item is especially valuable."

Never hire an appraiser who will charge you a percentage of the value of your item. A trustworthy appraiser will charge a flat or hourly fee for their services. This fee can be several hundred dollars. Get references for trustworthy appraisers. Estate attorneys, antique dealers, and others who work with appraisers regularly are good resources for finding an appraiser.
