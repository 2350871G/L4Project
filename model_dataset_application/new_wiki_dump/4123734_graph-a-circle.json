Graphing the Circle Know the equation of a circle. The standard form for the equation of a circle is (x \u2013 a)2 + (y \u2013 b)2 = r2. The symbols a and b represent the center of the circle as a point on an axis, with a as the horizontal displacement and b as the vertical displacement. The symbol r represents the radius. As an example, take the equation x2 + y2 = 16. Find the center of your circle. Remember that the center of the circle is shown as a and b in the circle equation.
