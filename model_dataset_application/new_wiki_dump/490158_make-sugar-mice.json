      "description":"Remove a small piece of the fondant for the ears. Roll the rest of the piece into a ball, then push it down to form a length (the mouse body). At one end shape a sharper point to create the nose and head shape. At the other end, keep the rounded ball shape - you will be attaching a ribbon tail here. Press in the two small confectionery balls to serve as eyes."
