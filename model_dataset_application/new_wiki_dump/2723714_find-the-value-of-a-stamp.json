          "description":"A stamp hinge is a small, transparent piece of folded paper coated in mild adhesive, sometimes glued on the back of a stamp and used to attach it to an album page. A stamp hinge will make the stamp-less valuable, even after it\u2019s been removed. If your stamp has a stamp hinge attached, call a stamp dealer or expert before attempting to pull it off on your own, as you could damage the stamp further."

Essentially, the worse the centering of the design and the heavier the cancellation mark on the stamp, the closer to a \u201cpoor\u201d grade it will receive.
