          "description":"The most common way to grow new African violets is to propagate them from the leaves of existing plants. Once you do this, you can sprout the cutting in water. To propagate a new African violet in water, you'll need a sterilized cutting tool, a thin-necked bottle (such as a sterilized beer bottle), and a plastic bag or wrap. Select a large and healthy leaf from a healthy African violet. Include 2 inches (5 cm) of stem and cut the leaf from the plant on a 45-degree angle. The cut side of the angle should be on the top of the leaf. Fill the bottle with lukewarm water. Place the stem of the leaf into the neck of the bottle, so that the stem is in water and the leaf is resting above the rim. Cover the leaf and top of the bottle loosely with plastic to help keep in the humidity. Place the leaf somewhere warm that gets lots of filtered light. Add more water as necessary to keep the stem submerged. Over the next several weeks, the cutting will begin to sprout baby African violets."

          "headline":"Plant a leaf right in the soil.",
          "description":"Alternatively, you can also plant that same cutting directly into soil rather than sprouting it in water. To do this you'll need your healthy leaf and 2 inches (5 cm) of stem cut from a healthy violet, a small pot of clear plastic, potting soil, and a plastic cover or wrap. Fill the pot with loose potting soil. Press the cut stem a half-inch (1.3 cm) into the soil. Cover the top of the pot with a clear plastic cover or wrap. Place the cutting somewhere warm where it will get lots of filtered sun. You probably won\u2019t need to water as long as the plastic keeps in the moisture."

          "headline":"Grow them from seeds.",
          "description":"One way to grow African violets is to start them from seed, though this is less common than propagating the plants from cuttings. To grow African violets from seeds, you'll need seed starters, a plastic cover or wrap, a spray bottle, growing lights, and a medium suitable for African violets, such as milled coconut and perlite or pasteurized peat moss. Water the medium and allow it to dry out so it\u2019s moist. Fill the seed starters with medium. Spray the top of the medium with water. Sprinkle a few seeds into the top of each starter cell. Cover the top of the cells with plastic. Place the seed starters 10 inches (25 cm) below the grow lights. Provide the seeds with 12 to 14 hours of light per day. If the environment stays humid thanks to the plastic wrap, you won\u2019t need to water."

For seedlings, wait until the seedlings have leaves that reach 2 inches (5 cm) in width.

Because the medium must be loose, well-draining, and allow for free root development, African violets are not often grown in soil. Most garden and home stores will sell a medium specifically designed for African violets. You can also make your own African violet mix by combining equal parts perlite, vermiculite, and peat moss."

          "description":"Because African violets are grown indoors, choosing the right pot is like choosing the right home for your plants. These plants grow best in pots that are sized for their root systems. Don\u2019t put your plant in a pot that\u2019s too large, otherwise it may not bloom. A good rule of thumb is to put your violet in a pot that\u2019s one-third the size of the plant itself, because this will match the size of the root system. For the current size of your seedlings or babies, a 2-inch (5-cm) pot will probably be sufficient. You can use either plastic or terracotta pots for your violets. Plastic pots require less watering, but terracotta pots provide more air flow."

Gently turn the cutting, along with all the soil, out onto a newspaper or table. Carefully remove the soil with your fingers to reveal the cut stem and all the babies. To distinguish one baby from another, look for small clusters of leaves that are attached to the parent. When you\u2019ve located all the babies, carefully trim each one from the parent using a sterilized cutting tool."
