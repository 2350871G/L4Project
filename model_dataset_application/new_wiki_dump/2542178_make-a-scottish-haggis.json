  "text":" Steps If you're going to use the stomach or sausage casing, rinse it thoroughly and soak it overnight in cold salted water.  Trim the fat and sinew from the tongue, liver, suet and heart. Remove the ventricles from the heart and cut the tongue, liver and heart into manageable 1-inch cubes. Set the suet aside. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook these parts over medium heat for 2 hours.  Remove from the hot water and drain well. Mince into a fine chop or grind. Trim any remaining gristle or skin and discard.  Separate the suet from the sinew and finely chop the fat, discarding the sinew.  Peel the onions and dice into 1-inch chunks.  In a large bowl, combine the minced liver, heart, tongue, suet, onions, and toasted oats. Season with salt, pepper, and dried herbs. Moisten with some of the cooking water so the mixture binds. Put the cubed tongue and heart into a large pot. Cover with water by 4 inches (10.2 cm), bring to a boil on high heat and then reduce to a simmer for 30 minutes. Add the liver and allow to simmer for a further 20 minutes. Add the diced onions and allow to simmer for a further 10 minutes. Ladle out and reserve 4 cups of the cooking liquid from the pot before draining out the contents into a colander.  Return the hot mixture into the pot and stir in the chopped suet.  Grind the mixture using a hand grinder or electric mixer attachment.  Preparing the Dry Ingredients Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Spread the rolled oats on a sheet tray and bake until golden brown, stirring regularly, about 10 minutes. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees F. Pour the oats into a large container and add the cumin, paprika, rosemary, thyme, cayenne and some salt and black pepper. Test the spice levels and seasonings. As in most dishes, spices and herbs will be adjusted to fit quantities. Adjust the spices and seasonings to your liking. Add the ground mixture to the dry ingredients and combine thoroughly with your hands. Add enough of the reserved stock to bind the mixture together. It should feel like a wet meatball but still be able to hold its shape when squeezed into a ball. Once the seasoning is correct, put the filling into an oven-proof dish that is big enough to take all the mixture.
