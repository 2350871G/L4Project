          "description":"If your home doesn\u2019t have any gutters, consider investing in a gutter system\u2014especially if you live in a rainy climate. Gutters collect the rainwater that runs off the roof of your home and deposits it onto the ground. A good gutter system will direct rainwater away from your home, which keeps it from leaking into the foundation and washing the foundation soil away. Most residential gutters are made from aluminum. Aluminum gutters are affordable and will last a long time. Gutters made with vinyl, galvanized steel, or copper are also available. Unless you have previous experience installing gutter systems, have a professional install them."

          "description":"For your gutters to work properly, they should slope down \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) toward the downspout for every 10 feet (3.0 m), by code. They must also remain free of clogs, holes, and sags. The most common gutter problem is blockage. Leaves, needles and other debris get trapped in the system, causing rain water to spill off your home too close to the foundation. Inspect your gutters closely and remove any debris that you find. If you find that your gutters are sagging, check the hangars. These can deteriorate over time, but can easily and cheaply be replaced. Check for leaks and holes in the gutters, as well. If you find any, gutter sealant can be purchased at any hardware store."

          "headline":"Clean your gutters regularly.",
          "description":"Gutters should be routinely cleaned of debris at least once per year. If your home is surrounded by a lot of trees, clean them out twice per year. Inspect your gutters after big rainstorms, as well, since these can cause a significant buildup of debris. Use a sturdy ladder to get up to the gutters. Wear rubber gloves and clear the muck out of the system by hand. Follow up the debris removal with a good flushing of water from your garden hose. Make sure the water is flowing freely out of the downspouts, and remove and blockages that may be preventing this. If you prefer, you can hire a professional to clean your gutters. The charge for this service varies, depending on the size of your home, but usually ranges from $50 to $250."

They should direct water at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from the foundation of your house. If yours currently don\u2019t do this, you can add extensions to make them more effective.

In most cases, these extensions are installed by simply screwing them on. Make sure to direct the water at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from your home\u2019s foundation. If necessary, you can connect the downspouts to PVC pipe and bury the pipe underground to direct the water further from your home."

The ideal spot for water to come out of the extension is on a sloped part of the ground, so that the water continues to drain further away from the house. Make sure the water doesn\u2019t end up on an incline that slopes back down to your home. This will result in the water draining straight back to the foundation of your home."

          "description":"Overflowing gutters and inefficient downspouts can erode the ground around the foundation of your home. This erosion will create a trench in the soil that traps the water there. If you see any gaps like this around your home, fill them in with soil. Firmly pack the soil in place for best results. Avoid soils with high clay content, since these drain poorly. Purchase granular soil with a high sand content. You can buy bagged soil at any home improvement store. Buy 1 bag to start the job. Once you know how much area 1 bag covers, you'll have a good idea of how many more you'll need to finish the job based on the size of your home and how steep you want to make the downslope."

          "description":"Instead of just filling the gaps in with soil, add a slight excess of it. This will create a gentle slope that leads away from the foundation of the house, preventing water from collecting around the foundation. This gentle slope should extend, at minimum, about 2\u20133 feet (0.61\u20130.91 m) from the house. Pack soil around your house and slope it downwards at about 1 inch (2.5 cm) per 1 foot (0.30 m). Be sure to pack the soil firmly when creating the slope. Then, add grass seed, which, once it takes root, will prevent the soil from eroding."
