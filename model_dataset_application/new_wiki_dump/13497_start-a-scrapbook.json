It can attempt to tell a story. Or it can simply unfold a set of events in chronological order. Let\u2019s say you took your first trip to Europe, and returned with hundreds of photos. You could choose to create a scrapbook that highlights each city you visited. European cities would be your theme. Maybe during your trip you got lost and met a group of locals who decided to show you the best places to visit in their city, including inviting you to an intimate gathering. You could craft your scrapbook around that impromptu adventure, which means your scrapbook would tell a story. Or maybe you don\u2019t want to leave anything out of your scrapbook about your trip. You could organize and display your photos in chronological order."

Figure out your preference by asking yourself a few questions:\nWhich method would be easiest for you? Which method would you most enjoy? Do you want to be able to hold your scrapbook in your hand once it\u2019s finished? Would you like to give your friends or family members their own copy of your scrapbook? Do you want to avoid the mess that comes with making a scrapbook by hand? Or do you enjoy the physical act of making crafts?"

Organize your pictures either by theme, chronological order, or based on the story you\u2019d like to tell. If your photos are on a computer, you can easily organize them by moving them into separate folders. If your photos are on your smart phone, first transfer them to a computer, and then separate them into folders."

Other sizes include the 8.5x11, the 8x8, and several different sizes of mini albums. The size you choose depends on the sizes and amount of your pictures, what you hope to accomplish with your scrapbook, and also the scope of the project you feel comfortable taking on. If purchasing your album as part of a scrapbooking kit, then the 12x12 size will have more of a variety of materials for you to use. If you don\u2019t want to take on a large project and if you prefer to finish your scrapbook quickly, choose an 8x8. One of the mini-sized albums is perfect for taking on a small project and capturing snapshots of occasions, like a baby shower."

Most of the design materials will be included in the kit, such as patterned paper, ribbon, stenciled designs, and word art. Here\u2019s an overview of the essential materials you\u2019ll need: an album with acid-free and lignin-free pages, page protectors to protect your photos from the oils on your fingertips, photo-safe glue or tape, pigma ink pen in your desired color(s), and scissors. In terms of the design materials included in your scrapbooking kit, the color of the paper and the types of designs you choose will depend on what your scrapbook is for. The materials you use to commemorate the birth of your son will likely differ from what you\u2019ll use to celebrate your daughter\u2019s fifth birthday."

Since you already know which photos you\u2019re going to be using and essentially how you want them grouped, you can make a sketch of four to six common layouts you\u2019d like for your scrapbook to include. Your layout will show how you\u2019d like your pictures to be placed on the page. Some pages could feature only one photo, some only two or three, while another could have a collage of several photos. Take a sheet of paper and draw out the layouts you\u2019d like to use.

If you\u2019re having trouble with this step, physically arranging a layout with some of your pictures at a table may help."

Once the background is applied, you can begin laying your pictures in their proper places, using your layouts as a guide. Don\u2019t glue them down until you feel confident about their placement. You may need to trim some photos if they aren\u2019t totally fitting on the page. Once your pictures are set and glued down, you can add your designs, like stickers or images, or special quotes and written messages. For a wedding scrapbook, you could include a biblical scripture that was read during your wedding ceremony. If you\u2019re creating a scrapbook of all of your kids, include comments identifying the dates and/or locations of some pictures.
