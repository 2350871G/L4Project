It\u2019s best to rinse them right away, so excess soil and other materials don\u2019t have a chance to sit on the fabric for too long. You can use a garden hose or the kitchen sink to rinse them. It\u2019s often easier to rinse the gloves if you leave them on your hands. That way, there aren\u2019t any folds or creases to hide dirt and debris."

          "description":"Because cotton is such a durable material, you can wash your gloves in the washer as you would any cotton clothing. You can use your usual detergent to help clean your gloves. Use the cold water setting to prevent shrinkage. If there are particularly stubborn stains on your gloves, you may want to pre-treat them with a stain removing product. Make sure to cover the stains completely with the stain remover, and allow it to sit on the gloves for approximately 10 minutes before washing them."

          "description":"Because heat can sometimes shrink cotton, it\u2019s usually best to air dry your gardening gloves. Use clothespins to attach them to a clothesline, so air can circulate around the gloves and help them dry more quickly. If you don\u2019t have a clothesline, you can use the pins to attach them to a hanger and allow them to dry that way. If you\u2019re in a hurry to dry your gardening gloves, you can toss them in the dryer to tumble dry. However, be sure to set the machine at low heat to minimize the possibility of shrinkage."

Start the cleaning process by brushing off any dry, loose, or caked on dirt and debris from the material. It\u2019s usually best to use your fingers to brush away the dirt, so you don\u2019t damage the leather. If you\u2019re having trouble brushing away the dirt by hand, you can also use a soft-bristled cleaning brush. Just be sure to use gentle strokes."

Use the paper towel or rag to work the soap into the leather, paying particular attention to the dirtiest areas. Spend several minutes working the saddle soap into the leather so it really has a chance to penetrate and lift out the dirt."

Don\u2019t allow the paper towel or rag to become too saturated with water, though, or you may damage the leather. If you notice that there is still dirt and grime on the glove while you\u2019re rinsing, you may want to repeat the cleansing process to get the leather completely clean. Once you\u2019re satisfied that the glove is clean, complete the same process with the other glove."

Set out a clean, soft towel on a table, countertop, or other flat surface, and allow the gloves to dry completely. Don\u2019t place your gloves near a heater, radiator, fire, or other open flame. The leather may crack. While your gloves are drying, it\u2019s a good idea to periodically put them on and stretch them. That will help stretch them so they maintain their shape."

          "headline":"Treat the gloves with oil.",
          "description":"Leather can become stiff over time, and the cleaning process itself doesn\u2019t always help with that. Once your gloves are completely dry, you should apply an oil to the leather to condition it so it becomes softer and the gloves are more comfortable to wear. Use clean, soft cloth to carefully spread linseed oil onto the gloves. Let it sit for several minutes, and then use a clean area of the cloth to rub it in. If you don\u2019t have linseed oil, mink oil is an effective alternative. You can also use a treatment product specifically for leather, which usually contains a blend of oils and other ingredients."
