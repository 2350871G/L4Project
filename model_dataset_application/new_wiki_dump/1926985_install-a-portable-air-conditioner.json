          "description":"Almost all portable air conditioners come with a window adaptor kit that will work, however in some cases the kit is missing or not right for the window, and you will have to improvise a bit. For the unit to function well, the gaps between the window adapter for the vent hose and the sides of the window must be sealed off. Measure your window opening to determine if the window adapter kit can be expanded or trimmed to fit correctly. If the window adapter kit that came with your portable unit is missing or does not adequately fit your window, take careful measurements of the opening you need to accommodate and have a piece of Plexiglas cut to size at your local hardware store. You can also use a piece of plywood, or even cardboard, to fill the gap. These options are less attractive, but will work in a pinch."

Close the window so that it fits snugly against the exhaust hose window connection, and holds everything firmly in place. In some cases, it may be necessary to use duct tape to seal the gaps around the exhaust hose window connection, and hold the window kit firmly in place."
