Next, grease a 24-count mini-muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray to keep the cups from sticking. Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it\u2019s reached the proper temperature. Most models will either flash an indicator light or beep to alert you. You can substitute butter for the nonstick cooking spray if you prefer. If you prefer, you can use a 12-count regular size muffin tin to make larger cups."

Use a wooden spoon to blend all of the ingredients together. Flaxseed meal is just ground flaxseeds. You can purchase it at many grocery and health food stores, or you can make your own by grinding flaxseeds in a food processor or coffee grinder. If you like, you can include other spices in the granola, such as ground ginger and/or ground cloves. Add \u00bd to 1 teaspoon (1 \u00bd to 3 g) of the spices to taste."

Stir the mixture well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully incorporated. You can omit the cranberries or substitute raisins if you prefer. You can substitute your favorite nut for the almonds, such as walnuts or cashews. However, it\u2019s important to chop them more finely because most nuts are much thicker than slivered almonds."
