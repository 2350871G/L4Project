          "description":"After sweeping the floor, mop it at least once each week. There\u2019s no need to use soap (though it doesn\u2019t hurt). This will keep your ceramic tile looking shiny and new. Once you\u2019ve mopped the floor, wring the mop out immediately and dry the floor with it to prevent any new dirt from settling in wet areas, and to protect you from slipping. If you use soap, use a non-toxic dish detergent. Start with a couple drops of detergent so it doesn\u2019t become over-concentrated. Too much detergent can leave soapy residue or film on your tiles. Continue regular maintenance on your floors without using any strong chemicals. Over time, chemicals can degrade the quality of your tiles."

Additionally, place a rug or another mat right inside the house. Encourage family members and visitors to wipe their feet on both mats, and to remove their shoes when they enter the home. Use of doormats is especially important during rainy and snowy seasons."

          "headline":"Clean your grout.",
          "description":"The grout is the sunken area bordering each ceramic tile. Over time, it can become discolored and gross. To keep it clean, mix baking soda and water in equal amounts. Coat the grout with the paste. Allow it to sit for several hours (or even overnight). Scrub the grout vigorously with an old toothbrush or a stiff-bristled brush. Wipe the paste scum away with a sponge soaked in warm water. If you have a large amount of grout to scrub, purchase a grout brush from the cleaning supplies section of your local store. For an extra boost of cleaning power, fill a spray bottle with vinegar and spray the paste after you apply it. The frequency with which you clean your grout is up to you. Clean your grout as often as you like, or when it begins to show discoloration. Floors that are used more heavily will require more frequent cleaning. If you have children, pets, and/or walk about your home with shoes on, you\u2019ll need to clean your grout more often."

Test any commercial cleaning solution on a small and out-of-sight portion of your ceramic tile before you apply it to a larger or more visible area of your tile. This will help you ensure that the solution does not discolor or otherwise damage your tile. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or creams containing gritty ingredients like silicate."
