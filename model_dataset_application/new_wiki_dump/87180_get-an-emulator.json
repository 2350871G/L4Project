Search for the emulator you want to install. There are a variety of emulators available for Android directly from the Play Store for most retro and handheld systems. Below are a few of the most popular:\nDraStic (Nintendo DS)\nFPse (PlayStation 1)\nPPSSPP (PSP)\nJohn GBC (Game Boy and Game Boy Color)\nMD.emu (Sega Genesis/Mega Drive)\nMy Boy! (Game Boy Advance)\nNostalgia.NES (NES)\nSuperRetro16 (SNES) Tap the Install button for the emulator you want. Note that some emulators require purchase, but may have a free trial available. Open your Android's web browser. None of the emulators come with ROM (game) files, so you'll need to download these separately using your browser. Search for the game files you want to download. There are dozens of websites that host game files for you to download. You'll be using ROMs for systems that used cartridges (Game Boy, NES, etc. ), and ISO files for systems that used CDs (PS1, PSP, etc.). You can search for \"game name rom/iso\" to find a specific game, or \"system roms/isos\" for lists of all available games. It is illegal in most areas to download game files for games you don't physically own. Tap the download link for the ROM or ISO file. This will begin downloading the file to your Android's storage. Open your emulator app. After you've downloaded a game or two, start up your emulator. Load your ROM or ISO file. The process will vary depending on the emulator you are using. Generally you'll be asked to browse your Android's storage and locate the files. If you downloaded them with your browser, you'll find them in your Downloads folder. Some emulators will scan your storage for game files automatically.",
