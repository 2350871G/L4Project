For a small bedroom with a theme, gravitate toward cool, calming tones of soothing blues, sea greens, blush pinks, beiges, greys, and crisp whites. Using one of these colors will open up and brighten the room. Paint your bedroom walls the color that you\u2019ve chosen. With a small bedroom, a simple color scheme is advised. For example, off-white walls with one accent wall painted a different coordinating color."

A bed can act as a focal point for the eye and design of the bedroom. Iron bed frames or open canopy poster beds are great options to maximize space while being versatile enough to correlate with most themes. If space in the room is limited, go with a bed that has storage drawers, or try a loft bed that has space for a desk underneath."
