  "text":" Get out a square piece of paper. It can be any kind of paper, though origami paper is best. Fold the paper from left to right or right to left. Crease the fold, then unfold the paper. Fold the paper again, but this time from top to bottom, or bottom to top. Crease the fold, then unfold the paper. The paper should be split into fourths. Flip the paper. Then make a diagonal fold, bringing the bottom right corner of the paper to the top left corner of the paper. Crease the fold, then unfold the paper. Make another diagonal fold, this time bringing the bottom left corner of the paper to the top right corner of the paper. Crease the fold, then unfold the paper. Make sure your paper is now split into triangles. There should be eight total triangles, and 2 triangles in each fourth of the paper. Anyway, there should be a fold starting from the left side of the paper all the way to the right side of the paper. Not a vertical line, not a diagonal line, but a horizontal line. It doesn't matter which way you place the paper. There should be a line from exactly left to right on the paper. If you didn't crease hard enough, you may have trouble identifying this line. But if you creased correctly, this line should be easy to spot. Once you have found this line, you should also find a line going up and down, splitting the line in half, so there should be a left part and a right part to the horizontal line. Next, bring both parts of the horizontal line together, forming a 3D figure. Identify the two triangles on your paper. Push one of the triangles down on a flat surface, then bring the top triangle down on the bottom triangle. Keep on pushing until both triangles come together into one triangle. You should not be able to push the top triangle further down into the bottom triangle. Notice that the paper has two flaps. Well, you are going to make more flaps! Before you make more flaps, you should see a crease in the center of the triangle, giving a right part and a left part to the triangle. Get hold of the right part of the flap, then fold up that flap to meet the crease in the center. After that, get hold of the left part of the flap, then fold that flap to meet the crease in the center. Flip the paper over, then repeat the previous step. You should have a basic diamond shape right now, but there are still more steps. Find the two Side flaps on one side of the diamond and fold them into the middle.  Flip the diamond over and repeat step 11.  Flip the paper over, and repeat the last two steps. This time, use the second part of the diamond instead of the first part of the diamond. Flip the \"diamond\" upside down and notice the two pockets on each side of the \"diamond\". Extend the pockets with your fingertips, then notice the two flaps on each side of the diamond at the very top of the diamond. Slide each of the flaps at the very top of the diamond into each of the pockets. Flip the paper over, then repeat the previous step again.  Blow gently into the bottom of the diamond, extending the top. Make sure you keep the flaps down with your fingers because sometimes if you don't tuck the flaps in very well, the flaps might come out and you may have to start over. Finished. ",
