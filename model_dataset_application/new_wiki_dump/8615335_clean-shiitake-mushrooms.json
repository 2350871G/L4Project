However, a quick rinse will not noticeably affect their composition. Simply run the faucet with cold water and hold your shiitakes in the stream for a few moments.

To remove a shiitake stem, tightly pinch it right where it meets the cap. Then slowly pry the stem away from the cap in the opposite direction the stem is leaning. For instance, if you\u2019re holding the mushroom upside down and the stem is leaning towards you, pry the stem away from you. Discard the stems or save them for use in soups and stocks."

They do require a bit more prep work, however, as they need to be soaked in water prior to cooking. Just be sure to snap off the stems first, as it's much easier to do while they're still dry."

Place a cap right side up on a cutting board and carefully cut it into thin slices. If you\u2019re comfortable doing so, you can stack one shiitake mushroom cap on top of another and slice them simultaneously in order to save time."
