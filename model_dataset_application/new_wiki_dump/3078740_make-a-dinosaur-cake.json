With a knife, carefully round off all the sharp edges and corners to create the head and neck shapes of the dinosaur. Set all the scraps aside for another recipe. Cover the uncut straight edge of the wedge with a layer of frosting. Position the head on the right side of the dinosaur body, half way between the bottom of the foot and the center of the back.

From the corner of the wedge, measure up one inch (2.5 cm) and make a two-inch (5-cm) horizontal cut into the length of the cake. Then follow the outer curve of the wedge and cut to taper the inside edge the same way as the outside, bringing the tail to a point. Frost the straight end of the tail and lay it down on the left side of the cake, about 1.5 inches (3.75 cm) from the bottom of the foot.
