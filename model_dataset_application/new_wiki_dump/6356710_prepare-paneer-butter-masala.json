Toss in bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, red chili and 1 tsp of crushed coriander seeds. Saut\u00e9 the mixture for 30 seconds. Add the onion. Saut\u00e9 for thirty seconds. Add in the ginger and garlic pastes. Continue cooking for 30 more seconds. Throw in the tomatoes, coriander powder and red chili powder. Cook on high heat until you see oil start to leave the spice mixture. This will take at least three to four minutes. Finishing the Paneer Butter Masala Puree the masala in a food processor or food mill. Be careful when transferring hot ingredients. Wipe the cooking pan clean. Heat the pan on medium high heat.
