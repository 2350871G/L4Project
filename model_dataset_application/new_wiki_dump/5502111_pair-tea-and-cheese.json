A lightly salted goat cheese will match well with green tea and sweet teas such as jasmine or rose-scented tea. Earl Grey tea is ideal for really salty teas. If you have a favorite floral-scented tea, pair it with saltier cheese. You'll love the complementarity and you may just find a new flavor match that really works well."

For example:\nAsiago cheese pairs well with grassy green tea such as Kukicha or Sencha. Match Brie with a first flush Darjeeling. Match Danish cream Havarti with Darjeeling. Match ricotta, mascarpone and goat cheese with green teas such as Japanese Sencha or Chinese Dragonwell. Pu-erh teas match well with high-fat cheeses."

For example, match nutty cheeses with Keemun, Ceylon or Dragonwell green teas. Pair Cheddar with black tea. For example, pair it with Earl Grey tea, with its delightful bergamot undertones.
