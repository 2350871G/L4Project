Using aluminum cookware often can introduce more aluminum into your body than is safe. Aluminum may damage the brain and block toxins from leaving the body."

They are both used in the shiny finish of copper cookware. Cooking often with this cookware may introduce these heavy metals into your food and body. A build up of these metals in your body may negatively affect your brain and cause chronic illnesses. If you want to use copper cookware, look for items where copper is only used on the outside. Sometimes, copper is placed between two layers of other metals, such as stainless steel, which is safe. Never buy cookware that has copper on the inside lining."

This can be very dangerous and release toxins into your food. If you use ceramic cookware that is cracked or chipped, get rid of it.

For others, you may need to inspect it a bit more closely before using it. Some may say on the bottom it is for decoration only and not for food. Many glazed terracotta dishes, especially from Latin American countries, may contain lead. Use these only for decoration; do not eat from them. Overly decorated tableware, especially from Asia, can pose a risk. If there are brightly colored decorations anywhere that will touch food, use caution. Homemade ceramics, even in the United States, may contain a lead glaze. Talk to the person before using it with food. Antique ceramic tableware poses a threat because it may be from before lead was outlawed. Decorations on top of the glaze may cause a deterioration of the glaze, exposing dangerous metals such as lead."
