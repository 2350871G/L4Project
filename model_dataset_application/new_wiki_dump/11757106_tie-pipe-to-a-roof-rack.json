Attaching a Single Pipe Lay the pipe vertically against the side runner of the rack. Place the pipe so it runs from front to back on the roof rack so there\u2019s less wind resistance. Lay it vertically so it\u2019s flush against the side rail of the roof rack. Hook a ratchet strap to the side runner near the rear of the pipe.

Wrap the strap around the pipe several times until there\u2019s a small amount of slack left. Slide the end of the strap into the ratchet and crank it open and closed until the pipe is securely fastened to the side rail. Give the pipe a good shake to make sure it\u2019s securely attached. Strapping Multiple Pipes Adjust the roof bars so they evenly support the pipes if you can. If the roof bars of your rack are adjustable, adjust them so the pipes are centered on them and supported evenly. Space them apart so that both the front and rear of the pipes overhang the bars evenly. If the pipes are less than 2\u20133 feet (0.61\u20130.91 m) long, move the bars so they\u2019re spaced out about 1 foot (0.30 m) apart. If you can\u2019t adjust your roof bars, make sure your pipes don\u2019t exceed the maximum overhang when they\u2019re attached to the rack. Stack the pipes vertically across the roof rack. Lay the pipes from the front to the back of the vehicle so they\u2019re more aerodynamic when you\u2019re driving. Center the pipes so they rest on top of the rack evenly. Stack them on top of each other neatly so they won\u2019t slide around. Keep the pipes in line with each other so they\u2019re attached evenly. Loop the hooks around the crossbars of the rack to secure them. Create an anchor point for your ratchet straps by looping the hook end around the corner of a crossbar on your roof rack. Run the strap through the hook and pull it tight so it\u2019s secure. Use the front and rear corners of the roof rack for your anchor points. Wrap the straps over the stacked pipes and insert the end into the ratchet. Run 1 strap around the pipes toward the rear of the vehicle, then slide the end of it into the ratchet connected to the strap. Then, wrap the other strap around the stack of pipes toward the front of the vehicle and thread the end into the ratchet. Pull the straps until there\u2019s about 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of slack. Remove the slack in the straps by pulling on the ends so they\u2019re threaded through the ratchets. Continue pulling them until each strap has a small amount of slack left in them so they can be fed into the ratchet handle. Don\u2019t try to pull them as tight as you can so you can give the ratchet a chance to catch the strap. Crank the ratchets open and closed to secure the pipes. Use your hands to open and close the handles of the ratchets. As you crank them, the ratchets will tighten the straps little by little, making them tighter. Continue cranking the ratchets until the pipes are held tight against the roof rack and don\u2019t move at all.
