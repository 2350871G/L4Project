Always remove the papery shells since these will become tough and bitter if cooked. Cut the tomatillos into 1/4 in (0.6 cm) thick slices. Use a sharp knife to cut each tomatillo into even slices. Set the slices aside while you mix the breadcrumb coating. Beat 3 large eggs. Crack the eggs into a shallow bowl or pie plate and use a whisk or fork to beat them. Set the bowl on a counter near your stove. Mix the breadcrumbs, flour, salt, and cumin in a separate bowl.

Run the tomatillos under warm water until the sticky residue is completely gone. Set the tomatillos on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut each 1 in half. Toss the tomatillos with 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of oil on a baking sheet. Place the tomatillo halves on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle the vegetable oil over them. Use your hands to toss the tomatillos a little so they're coated in the oil. Turn each tomatillo half so the skin side is facing up. Place the peppers and garlic on the baking sheet with the tomatillos. Trim the stems from 2  jalape\u00f1os, 2 poblanos, and 2 serrano peppers.
