          "description":"Remove your fish from the tank before scrubbing down the sides with an algae scrubber. You can buy an algae scrubber online or at a local pet store. You should use this to remove algae from a fish tank rather than simply changing out the water. Use the scrubber to gently scrub the sides and bottom of the tank where you see algae. Work from the top of the tank downward. This way, algae will sink to the bottom. This makes it easier to remove from the water. If you can't find an algae scrubber, any scrubbing device with a rough surface will work. In rare cases, you may need to use a razor blade to remove very stuck-on algae. If you are using a razor blade, hold it at a 45 degree angle to remove algae from your tank."

Instead of using a scrub brush, buy water treatments from a local greenhouse, department store, or online store. You pour a small amount of the water solution into your pond to effectively remove algae. Refer to the directions to know precisely how much to use, which depends on the size of your pond. Most water treatments will need to be applied over the course of a few days to successfully remove algae."
