One of the most popular methods is just to spray a couple of cotton balls with your favourite perfume, or other scented product, and hang the balls up in your closet. You could use some scented essential oils rather than perfume. You can also just place the cotton on a shelf in your closet. The scent will transfer onto your clothes overnight.
