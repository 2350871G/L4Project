The leaves are green and tri-cornered with small hairs on their skin. If you choose to harvest wild kudzu, make sure that the area has not been sprayed with pesticide. Be careful that you do not harvest poison ivy instead. This plant is often found mixed in with kudzu, but its leaves are smaller."

Gently add the flower to your basket or harvest sack being careful not to crush them. Most of the flowers grow at the base of the plant, so you will not have to pull down too many high-climbing vines. Keep fresh kudzu flowers in the refrigerator for up to one day before processing or cooking."

Place the leaves in your basket and do not crush them. It is possible to cook with the larger \u201cpoke\u201d leaves but these are often tough and chewy in texture. Also, be sure that any leaves that you choose are free of any sign of bites by animals or insects."

If you feel up to a challenge, use a larger shovel and attempt to remove some of the deeper tubers, which can weigh upwards of 200 pounds. Make sure that you wear gloves while digging."

This starch comes in a variety of forms including jarred powder, heavy chunks, or sliced flakes. The color determines the price and quality, with whiter starches being more expensive.

Start by bringing a large pot of water up to boiling. Put the leaves into the water and leave them for about a minute. Spoon them out and allow them to dry before eating or cooking.

Then, you can bake, roast, grate, shred, or even pound the root flat. Some people grind them into a fine powder, like what is sold in stores. If you mash the peeled roots, continue to do so until they form a grey paste. Use a screen to filter the paste with water until the color begins to lighten to white. Then, set the paste out to dry in a room temperature, often dark, space for up to two months. Some people dry the paste on a mesh rack, while others simply set the paste blocks on wax paper on a shelf. Make sure that the drying area is clean and free of dust or pests."
