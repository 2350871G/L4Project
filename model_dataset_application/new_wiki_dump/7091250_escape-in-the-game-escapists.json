If you don't attend one, for example breakfast, then your guard heat will raise in most prisons; it goes up to 70-99% but be careful if you get your heat 90% or over, as then you have to hide because the snipers in the guard towers will snipe! For example: Say that you are digging underground and you don't know that roll-call is next; then you're screwed and your plan is gone and every contraband item you had!"

For example: Let's say that you're running late to exercise period and you don't know where it is, then chances are you're going to waste time looking for it and not make it in time!"

      "description":"In the picture here, you can see that that fence looks not like the normal black one which most likely means it's electrical. Now you're most likely wondering \"But wait, if it's electrical, then how do we get past it?\" Every prison has power generator and you're going to have to go to that power generator and click it to turn off the power making the fence okay to cut. However, you will need a good cutting tool, such as cutters because that power generator will go back on in 1 hour (game time) and 1 hour in the game is 60 seconds (real life time) so you have 60 seconds to cut threw that fence and not die. About the cutters: There are three levels in every tool, so by every tool this means shovel, cutters, and pickaxes and the three levels are flimsy, lightweight and sturdy. Flimsy is the worst, lightweight is of medium effect and sturdy has the best effect."
