  "text":" Steps Cover the bottom of a cookie sheet in a layer of corn starch.  Wash and dry your hands.  Making the filling Grease and heat a frying pan to medium\u2013high temperature.  Empty the can of red bean paste onto the frying pan and spread to create a layer of red bean.  Evaporate the excess water and smash the beans with a spoon. The end result should be a consistency that can hold its shape i.e. can be rolled into a ball. Making the dough Mix the sweet rice flour, cup of water, and sugar together evenly in a bowl.  Cover the liquid in plastic wrap. The liquid should not be exposed to any air. Microwave for 3 minutes.  Mix the contents and check for the presence of liquid. If there is liquid, microwave for 1 to 2 minutes more. The finished dough should be an even off-white color and tar-like in consistency. Making the rice cake Transfer the dough onto a plate or cutting board with a spatula. It is best to use the plastic wrap and position the plastic wrap in between the object and the dough. Use the cool bowl of water to cover your hands in a coat of water. Always keep your hands wet. Obtain a section of dough that flattens into about the size of your palm about 1 to 1.5 cm thick. The dough will be hot so be careful. If the dough sticks to your hand, use cool water to unstick the dough. Once the dough is flat, place a 0.5 to 1 inch ball of red bean paste into the middle of the dough.  Bring the ends of the dough together and they will stick to each other. For aesthetic purposes, you could roll the cake in your hands. Place the cake onto the cookie sheet covered in corn starch.  Use a spoon to completely cover the cake in corn starch.  Slightly flatten the cake with a spoon.  After 5 minutes, flip the cake over and flatten slightly once more.  Repeat steps 2 through 9 to make more cakes.  Brush off the excess corn starch with a barbecue brush.  Serve or refrigerate. Enjoy!",
