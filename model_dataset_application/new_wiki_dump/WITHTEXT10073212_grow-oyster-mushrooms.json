          "description":"If you live in the USA, it\u2019s relatively easy to come by oyster mushroom spawn or starter cultures: they can be ordered from Amazon, and from any number of other online seed catalogs. Order at least 50 spawns or starter cultures for this growing method. If you live in Canada (or elsewhere outside of the USA), it may be a little more difficult to acquire the spawn. Check European online sources like http://www.mycelia.be/en. Regardless of where you live, check with your local plant nursery. Nurseries may stock mushroom spawn. If not, the nursery may be able to recommend another retailer that does."

          "headline":"Punch 4 to 5 holes in all sides of both milk cartons with a pencil.",
          "description":"The holes should be situated at different heights around all 4 sides of each carton. For example, each side could have a hole at 3 inches (7.6 cm) and 1 at 6 inches (15 cm). This way you\u2019ll end up with 20\u201325 holes total per carton at a variety of heights. Make sure that your pencil is sharp before you begin poking the holes."

The bowl that you use should be large enough to contain the full 10 cups (850 grams) without overflowing, and ideally should be made of plastic, glass, or porcelain. You can use any type of regular coffee grounds that you\u2019ve produced through making coffee. Just save them up for a few days until you\u2019ve produced the 2 cups (170 g). You can get sawdust from any nearby hardware store. Since 8 cups (680 g) is a relatively small amount, they may give you the sawdust for free. You can also use hay that has been pasteurized in boiling water for 35 to 45 minutes. Just mix the hay and mushroom spawn together in a plastic bag that has holes poked in it."

Start by adding about 2 cups (0.47 L) of water, and add more water as necessary. If you accidentally add too much water and the mixture becomes soupy, just pour some water back out. Don\u2019t add water if you\u2019re using hay."

Depending on the heat settings of your microwave, you may need to microwave for longer. The water should be boiling hot after microwaving, so if it\u2019s not that hot after 2 minutes, microwave for another 2 minutes. If you skip this step and do not microwave the sawdust and coffee ground, bacteria may kill the mushroom spawn before they have a chance to grow. Don\u2019t microwave the mixture if you\u2019re using hay."

Periodically test the temperature of the spongy coffee grounds and sawdust by pressing your finger into the mixture. If you\u2019re in a hurry, try putting the bowl in your fridge for 30 minutes."

Use your hands to press down on the mixture every 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) or so, to ensure that it\u2019s packed at an even consistency throughout.

Try placing them in a cellar or basement. If you don\u2019t have a basement, you could set the mushroom cartons under your bed or in a pantry cabinet. Some sunlight in the room is fine, since the mushrooms would occasionally have direct sunlight if they were growing in nature. Do not disturb the mushrooms while they\u2019re growing. You\u2019re welcome to check in on them and watch as they grow from day to day, though. If you\u2019re using hay as the growing medium, place it in a warm\u2014but not hot\u2014place that is out of direct light."

No regular maintenance is required, aside from making sure that the soil is damp. If using hay, mist the bag once or twice daily when you start to see white mushroom growth in the hay."
