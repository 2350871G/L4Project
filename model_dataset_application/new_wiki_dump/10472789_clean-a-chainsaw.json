To make a cleaning solution, combine 1 gallon of water and 1 cup of household ammonia in a plastic bucket. When working with ammonia make sure to work in a well-ventilated area, and avoid contact with your skin or eyes. It is best to use gloves and eye protection to be safe. Never mix ammonia with chlorine bleach as this produces a toxic gas."
