  "text":" Preparing the Petals Cut out the petals from the red felt. Use the two paper pattern circles you've already cut out earlier, to make the following amounts of felt petals:\nFollowing the 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) circle, cut out 20 small pieces of felt. Following the 3.5 centimeter (1.4 in) felt, cut out 30 larger pieces of felt. Once the felt circles have been cut, cut them in half straight down the middle. You'll now have a pile of semi-circle felt petals. Sewing the Petals to the Pillow's Front Panel Begin sewing the petals onto the pillow's front panel. To prepare the 19 x 19cm panel, draw a circle around it using a compass as a guide. Leave a decent amount of edge space between this circle and the edge of the fabric. Place the straight edge of a big petal flush with the edge of this circle. Pin in place then sew along the straight edge to attach it to the fabric. Continue sewing on the large petals, right around the circle edge. Once you reach the end of this circle, it's time to start layering the petals all the way into the center of the pillow panel. Sew the second layer of the petals. Place the straight edge of the petal just below the straight edge of the petals already sewn on, aligning the petal so that it sits over the junction or meeting point of two petals already sewn in place (see image). Repeat this all the way around the second circle. Keep using the large petals for now. Continue to add more layers of petals each time you reach the end of a circle. Eventually you'll need to swap to the smaller petals, to give the impression of decreasing petal size. Finish up sewing on the petals. As you reach the center of the felt rose, you'll need to place fewer and fewer petals, as the space becomes tighter. Just be sure to keep aligning the petals neatly and to cover any gaps so that no fabric shows through. At the very end, sew two petals at the heart or center of the rose. Assembling the Small Rose Pillow Sew the fabric panels together to create the rose pillow. Fold over one side of each of the two smaller pieces of fabric. Right side of the flower panel facing upward, place  the two folded pieces of fabric on top of the flower panel. Align the four sides of the fabric pieces so that the folded places are positioned in the middle. Sew a seam around the edges of all the pieces of the fabric, joining the panels together. Leave the middle part at the folds open to create space for the zipper, buttons or Velcro. Ensure that the corners of the pillow's panels are neat. Add a zipper, Velcro tabs or buttons at the folded middle part of the small pillow. This will allow you to open the pillow and remove the cover for easy cleaning. Then turn the pillow cover right side out. Stuff a small pillow insert or batting/stuffing inside. Done\u2013\u2013you should now have a stunning small rose pillow with many individual petals.",
