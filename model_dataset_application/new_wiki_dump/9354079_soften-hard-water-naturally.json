Fill a clean pot or kettle with water and place it on a stove burner set to high. Allow the water to boil for a few minutes. If you aren't sure if your water is hard, or if you want more specific information about the  minerals in your water, test it with water hardness testing strips.

This sediment is made up of insoluble minerals, which can't be boiled away. Use a baster, siphon, or ladle to transfer the water to a clean container. Although it's not harmful, try to avoid as much sediment as you can during the transfer. Letting the sediment settle on the bottom first allows you to easily remove the clear water while leaving most of the sediment behind."

Water treated with a filter often has a better taste. These filters can be bought at most grocery stores and general retailers. Look for systems that have a secondary filter, like one made from carbon or that uses reverse osmosis, to ensure contaminants are being removed from your water."

Baking soda doesn't filter the minerals out of hard water, but it makes it softer to the touch. Softened water cleans and rinses better. Baking soda is also mildly abrasive, so it helps to more thoroughly clean your clothing."

If your machine has a fabric softener dispenser, you can fill this with the vinegar before you start the load and it will be released automatically. Vinegar, which is a natural acid, helps to neutralize hard water with a lot of calcium in it. Calcium is a very alkaline mineral. Even though vinegar has a strong smell, this will be completely washed out by the rinse cycle. If you want to turn vinegar into a scented cleaner, mix 1.5 drops of an essential oil, like lavender, with it before adding it to laundry. Only use white vinegar for softening your laundry water. Other kinds, like apple cider vinegar, won\u2019t do the trick."
