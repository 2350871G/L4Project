          "description":"Ask a representative at the store if there is a dedicated section for baby-themed items. Peruse the items the store has to offer. Work inside of your theme or color scheme to help narrow your options and keep you from becoming overwhelmed. Select different colors or textures of cardstock to be the base of your invitation. Then, look for any additional items you want to use to decorate it, like stickers, stamps, or ribbon. To make the shopping process easier, outline or sketch a rough drawing of what you would like the invitation to look like. Note what colors you want each piece or layer to be. Then, ask for a representative in the store to help you locate items to match the sketch."

        {
          "headline":"Layer different colored cardstock to frame the invitation information.",
          "description":"Create layers using patterned, textured, and solid colored cardstock. Choose colors and patterns of cardstock that will reflect the theme of the baby shower. Take a decorative piece of cardstock and cut it into a 5 by 7 in (13 by 18 cm) rectangle. This will make a standard-sized invitation. Layer the decorative cardstock with a matching piece that is a solid color. Make the length and width of the top layer about \u20442\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm) smaller than the bottom layer. Add some texture to the edging of each piece of the cardstock by trimming it with decorative scissors."

          "headline":"Wow your guests by making the invitation into a fun shape.",
          "description":"If you are handing your invitations out in-person and don\u2019t have to worry about fitting it into an envelope, then pick a shape that best represents the theme of the baby shower. Find a simple but recognizable silhouette online and trace it onto your cardstock, or draw the outline of the image by hand. Center the invitation shape on the baby and make it into the shape of a onesie, a diaper, or baby bottle. Pick a specific shape that is representative of the baby shower theme. Have the invitation be the shape of a cowboy hat if the shower is western themed, or make it into an owl if the shower is \u201cHarry Potter\u201d themed. Choose a shape that plays on the selected title of the invitation. For example, make the invitation into the shape of a peanut or a pumpkin to match a title that says, \u201cWelcoming our little peanut/pumpkin.\u201d"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Include copies of photographs to personalize the invitation.",
          "description":"Bring the invitation to life by including 1 or 2 personal photos. This is a great alternative to using stock photos or simple clipart images. Use a picture of the most recent sonogram or even pictures from any maternity photoshoots that were done. For example, simply print a copy of the photo you want to use and display it alongside the invitation information on a piece of cardstock."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use fun stickers and stamps to subtly decorate the invitation.",
          "description":"Stickers and stamps are a quick and affordable way to add some personality quickly to plain-looking invitations. Pick up a pack of stickers that has at least 2-4 sheets so you can use the same images on multiple invitations. Or choose 2-3 stamps and inkpad colors that will contrast nicely with the invitation color, so you can easily add different pops of color to each invitation. This is a great way to embellish an invitation without making it too bulky to mail. For example, for an invitation shaped like a circus tent for a circus-themed baby shower, you could add stickers of clowns or different colored balloon stamps. Purchase packs of stickers, stamps, and different colored ink pads at your local craft store or online with major retailers."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Give your flat invitations dimension by adding textured embellishments.",
          "description":"Use items like ribbons, buttons, or other raised crafting items to give your invitation added dimension. Pick 1 raised decoration so you don\u2019t overload the invitation. This is ideal for invitations that you are planning to give out by hand. If you are mailing your invitations, keep in mind the size of your envelope. Too many raised decorations may make the invitation too plump to fit. For example, hole-punch each of the corners of the invitation and thread it with a decorative ribbon. Then, either hot-glue the ends of the ribbon down or fashion it into a fun bow. If your invitation is the in the shape of a doll or has a prevalent image of a doll on it, give the face of the doll texture by gluing on some buttons for eyes."
