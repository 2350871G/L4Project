You will also need to use separate cookware, utensils, salt and pepper shakers, bread trays, draining racks, dish towels, and tablecloths for meat and dairy items, as these items also cannot be prepared together or eaten at the same meal. It is common to use color-coding to distinguish between the meat and dairy items. For example, buy a blue set of cookware for meat and a red set for dairy. If you cannot buy entirely new sets, use a kosher paint pen to specify which food category that utensil should be used for. Cabinets or pantries do not require kashering, as it is assumed that kosher food will be stored securely inside kosher containers. However, feel free to deep clean the cabinets to hold to the true spirit of kashrut."

Predatory fowl cannot be eaten, slaughter must be precise and painless for the animal, blood must be removed from meat, and dairy must come only from kosher animals."
