A fixed pricing package gives you a specific price per kilowatt hour, which will be charged for the duration of your contract. Variable Rate Plan. A variable pricing package has prices that could change during the contract. The price could go either up or down, so you\u2019re taking a risk by choosing this type of package. Sometimes, however, the initial pricing is low enough to outweigh the potential risk."

Low prices are great, but if you can\u2019t get in touch with the company when you have an outage, or if you\u2019re on hold for hours to speak to customer service, price won\u2019t matter."
