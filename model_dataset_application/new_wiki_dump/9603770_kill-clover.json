Look for a fertilizer with a high nitrogen content at your local hardware store or online. Spray the fertilizer directly on the clover, following the instructions on the label. Go for an organic, slow release fertilizer if you only have small patches of clover in your lawn. If you have large patches or sections of clover, opt for a fertilizer that is quick release to get rid of this weed right away. You can apply the fertilizer once a month, or based on the instructions on the label. Applying the fertilizer every spring is also a good preventative measure to stop clover from growing."
