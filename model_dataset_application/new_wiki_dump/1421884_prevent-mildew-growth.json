Open some windows around your home so there\u2019s a comfortable breeze blowing through them. If you don\u2019t feel a breeze after opening windows, use floor or ceiling fans to help move the air around. If it\u2019s already humid outside, avoid opening your windows since you could let some of the moisture indoors. Open windows on the opposite side of your home if possible so the air can come in one way and out the other. That way, mildew spores blow out of your home rather than circulating around it."
