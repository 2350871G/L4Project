          "description":"Put on some music that you enjoy and are familiar with. Go stand in front of a full-length mirror and try out a few basic dance moves. If you feel goofy doing this, that\u2019s fine, but just own it and try anyway. This is also a good time to try some more complicated steps. Dancing by yourself at home will also help your body to develop muscle memory. This will make it easier for you to handle complicated moves when you are at a party surrounded by other people. As you practice you\u2019ll probably realize that certain moves just aren\u2019t for you. Knowing what steps to avoid is an important part of the learning process."

          "headline":"Practice with an app.",
          "description":"There are a number of apps that you can download to your phone that will show you exactly what steps to do for a particular dance or style of dance. Pull up the directions and go through them at home. Or, for extra confidence, give the steps a quick glance through right before you step out on the dance floor."

          "headline":"Practice with a partner beforehand.",
          "description":"Ask a friend, partner, or even family member to dance with you at home. Turn on some music and warm up by jumping around and trying out a few freestyle moves. Then, switch to a particular style of music, like hip-hop, and concentrate on moving with your partner to the rhythm. This doesn\u2019t mean that you have to actually touch your partner, whether in practice or at the party. It\u2019s more about being aware of how your partner is moving and responding to it."

Even watching music videos can be helpful. This is a great way to safely learn how to mimic more experienced dancers."

They can also make you more comfortable with your body."

          "description":"Give yourself a time limit, such as 15 minutes, before you start dancing at a party. Of course, you can wait until other people are out there. The point is to not wait too long before jumping in. Aim to be neither the first nor the last person who starts to dance. To keep yourself from leaving the dance floor too soon, set a goal of dancing for at least five minutes before you take a break."

          "headline":"Copy other people\u2019s moves.",
          "description":"Look around and pay attention to other people who are dancing. If you see someone who moves in a way that you like, try to imitate just one or two of their moves. Don\u2019t make the mistake of mirroring them directly or they could take offense. Instead, repeat the same basic copied moves a few times until you feel comfortable with them. Once you feel comfortable with a move that you\u2019ve copied, go ahead and modify it to make it your own. For example, you might like the way a particular dancer double-taps their toes to the beat of the music. You could make it your own by adding in a snap at the end of each tap."

        {
          "headline":"Join in on group dances.",
          "description":"A comfortable way to get started is to hop in on a synchronized and well-known group dance. The moves will probably be familiar and you can change them up a bit if you want. In fact, cutting loose and acting a little goofy is part of the fun with these types of dances. If you don\u2019t know the moves to a particular group dance, stand at the side for a moment and watch before joining in. You\u2019ll likely figure out the steps very quickly. For example, \u201cYMCA\u201d by the Village People or Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cCelebrate,\u201d often lead to fun-filled group dances."

          "description":"Start off small with simple movements, such as hand taps. Take your time with these and gradually add in more complicated steps. Don\u2019t expect to be an expert right away. You\u2019ll probably blend in more with basic moves, so be prepared to draw more attention as you get more creative and original."

          "description":"Unless you are interested in dancing with a partner, try to maintain a little bit of distance between yourself and other people. In a crowded club, this might mean just a few inches of room. But, even that small amount of space could keep you from accidentally hitting others or stepping on their feet."

Try to make it look natural, not as if you are just stiffly moving directly up and down. Sometimes it helps to close your eyes for a few moments. This is a great way to join in on the fun without pushing yourself out onto the dance floor, especially at a crowded party."

Head back in the opposite direction with both feet. As you keep going, you are basically stepping from the side-to-side along with the music."

Take it one step further by rolling your shoulders or upper body at the same time. You can even try snapping the fingers on both hands and rolling your wrists for an extra flourish."

Then, slide your foot back in the same pattern. Do the same move with your left foot and hip. If you feel both your hips completing a small square of movement, then you are doing it right."

Let them follow the motion of your feet and pop them off to the side slightly. Run your fingers through your hair every so often. Or, simply raise your arms up when the music reaches its peak."

To complete this move, visualize passing a hula hoop from your shoulders downwards. This will force you to push out your chest, waist, and hips at different times."

Bring your left foot over until it\u2019s directly behind your right one. Move your right one over another horizontal step. Shadow it once more with your left and repeat. This will carry you across the dance floor. It\u2019s not necessary to do a grapevine across the entire floor, if you don\u2019t want to. Instead, just take a few steps right, shadow them with your left foot, and then let your left foot take the lead in the opposite direction."
