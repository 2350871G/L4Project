Using the Plant Hardiness Zone scale can help not only identify your local climate, but also the best types of trees to plant. The Arbor Day Foundation offers a system of identifying climate for plants called the Plant Hardiness Zones. It divides the United States and Canada into 11 different zones that are based on a 10 degree Fahrenheit difference in the average annual minimum temperature. The United States, for examples, is located within Zones 2 through 10. You can access the Plant Hardiness Zones at http://shop.arborday.org/content.aspx?page=zone-lookup and then lookup the zone in which you fall. Knowing your zone will help you identify the types of trees and other plants that you can plant and expect to grow in the zone\u2019s temperature extremes. Know that the Plant Hardiness Zones don\u2019t account for local differences including moisture, soil, winds, and other conditions that could affect the survivability of individual plants."

Factors such as slope, neighbors, drainage and erosion can have an impact on what trees will thrive on your land. For example, if you live on particularly hilly or steep land, it may not be a good idea to plant trees because their roots may not be able to take proper hold. If you\u2019re planting a tree or trees to combat erosion, you\u2019ll want to plant trees that already have a strong root ball so they don\u2019t get swept away at the next rainfall or windstorm. Think about what kinds of other trees and plants are there so that the tree you plant not only fits in with the overall aesthetic scheme, but also that the tree has room to grow and won\u2019t kill other plants and trees around it."

Zoning laws related to planting are often related to digging holes near telephone and electric poles and other cables. You'll need to make sure that you know where these cables and systems before you dig. You may also want to check with local utility companies about digging around their poles and cables so that you don\u2019t disturb them or harm anyone when you plant or as the tree grows. In the United States, you can call 811 before you dig. This will get your underground utility lines marked for free, which will help to prevent damage, injury, and fines."

Keep as much dirt around the roots as possible and don\u2019t move it more than necessary to keep the roots from drying out. Don't leave a tree's roots out of its container or burlap for too long because this could damage or dry them out. If you\u2019ve decided to plant a seed instead of an already growing tree, follow this step. Growing a tree from a seed means germinating the seed, planting it at the appropriate time and taking close care of it. This method will take than transplanting a tree from a container. To get a seed to germinate, you may have to use scarification. This means that you break the seed coat and allow moisture to penetrate so that the plant embryo can begin germinating.

Stake the tree if necessary. If your tree is still a sapling, use a stake to help it grow for about the first year of its life This will keep the tree from blowing over in the wind and allow the roots to become established. Make sure the stakes you are tied loosely to the trunk. Do not dig into the bark or tighten around the trunk. Remove the stakes once the roots have a chance to become established, after about a year. Larger trees may need two or three stakes. Caring for Your Tree Water the newly planted tree. Once the tree is planted, water it and keep up a regular schedule of watering. This will help the roots become established in the surrounding soil. Water the tree every day for several weeks to let the roots get established. After this, you can reduce the frequency of watering. Water as necessary for the conditions in your area. Take into consideration humidity, rainfall, and sunshine to help you decide when to water your tree. If you are planting fruit or nut trees for a small home orchard, continue to water weekly for the life of the tree, as your crop depends on consistent irrigation. You\u2019ll also want to fertilize fruit and nut trees monthly, or according to package directions. Use mulch. Considering adding a layer of mulch around your tree to help keep moisture in and weeds out. Cover the planting hole with 1-3 inches (2.5 cm - 7.6 cm) of shredded hardwood or leaf mulch. Keep the mulch at least 12 inches away from the trunk or it may cause the trunk to rot. Mulching around the tree will protect the tree from trampling and lawnmowers, which are two activities that commonly kill young trees. Prune the tree if necessary. If there are any broken, dead, or diseased limbs on your tree, remove them gently with a knife or gardening shears. If there is nothing wrong with the tree, there is no need to prune it until after the first growing season. Enjoy the tree as it grows over the years. Appreciate its shade and beauty and thank yourself for adding another tree to the world. You won't regret it and as long as you properly care for it, the tree can grow a long time! You\u2019ll need to make sure that you water your plant to keep it thriving. You want to achieve a balance of giving it enough water to penetrate the roots while not drowning it. Watering your tree with a steady stream from a garden hose for about 30 seconds should be sufficient. The soil should feel moist at all times and mulch will help retain the moisture. Check soil moisture by digging about 2\u201d below the surface and then use your finger to test if soil is moist. If it is, you don\u2019t need to water.",
