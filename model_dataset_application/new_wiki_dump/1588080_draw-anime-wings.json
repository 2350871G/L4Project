Around the face, draw in the lines for the hair as shown, assuming you want long hair for your character. By all means make it shorter if preferred. At the base of the rectangular body form, pencil in the top of the character's legs, using half squares."

For the wings, focus on shading in a jagged manner, to try to keep the idea of feathering and lightness. It's also a good idea to match the wing color with the nimbus color, to carry through the idea of radiance and an aura."
