      "headline":"Choose where you will plant.",
      "description":"Choose a place where the plants you have chosen will get an adequate amount of sunlight. Make sure there is enough room too. Some plants start out tiny, but in a matter of weeks have grown several inches, so keep that in mind when choosing where to plant."

      "headline":"Decide how you want the plants to be formatted in the garden.",
      "description":"Most plants grow well if they are in rows, but they will need to be spaced out. Make sure you know which plants you are planting where. If you need to, make signs to place in front of each row. For example, there would be a sign saying \u201clettuce\u201d in front of the lettuce row."

      "headline":"Loosen the soil.",
      "description":"Plants need to be able to grow and develop their roots in order to stay healthy, but if the soil is too hard or rocky, they won't be able to. So you need to make sure that the soil your planting in is loose enough for the plant's roots to grow in. To loosen the soil, take a trowel and shovel up the dirt over and over, until it is light and loose. Some plants only need the soil to be a little loose, while others need it to be as light and sandy as possible."

    {
      "headline":"Use mulch.",
      "description":"This can insulate the soil and help prevent frost. You can use wood chips, leaves or compost. It should be several inches thick."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Maintain your garden.",
      "description":"Water your plants every day, more or less if you find they prefer it that way. If the ground freezes, water at a time when it isn't frozen. The amount of water you give depends on the plants and the temperatures, but the minimum is at least every five weeks. Remove weeds if they grow and kill any harmful bugs."
