For example:\nWaxy potatoes such as red skinned and fingerling don\u2019t get as crispy as other varieties. Starchy potatoes such as russet and sweet potatoes are mildly crispy when roasted. All-purpose potatoes such as Yukon Gold and purple potatoes get crispy on the outside but stay creamy on the inside."

However, many people enjoy the texture of roasted potato skins and leave them on. Alternatively, peel the potatoes and roast the skins separately for a crunchy, salty snack. Use a vegetable peeler to easily peel potatoes."

If you\u2019re making a hearty side dish, cut the potatoes into larger chunks. If you\u2019re using small thin-skinned potatoes, you can leave them whole. Larger, thick-skinned potatoes can be halved, quartered, or cubed. Roast diced potatoes for a crunchy, salty hash."
