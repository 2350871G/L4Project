If some Sims are in private school and the others are in public school, the bus will come instead, because the mod can't figure out where to send the Sims. To deliberately keep the taxi from coming, place the bus stop sign on the lot (either outside or on a surface indoors). This sign triggers the bus to pick up and drop off the Sims as though the mod isn't installed. Use the community lot phone to send your Sim home if they miss the taxi after school. If your Sim misses the taxi to school, you can direct them to take a car to school or walk to school (if you have Apartment Life), but you won't be able to go to school with them."

Click the School Bell and select End school to make all non-resident students unselectable. (You may have to have a Sim perform \"Say Goodbye\" for the students to leave.) Using Chris Hatch's Go To School Mod Download the hacks required. The Go To School mod requires multiple files to function properly, which are located on Sim File Share. You'll need to download these files to use the mod:\n\nCJH_GlobalOverrides(Pets+).package (from https://simfileshare.net/folder/22091/)\n\nCJH_GlobeSculpture(Pets+).package (from https://simfileshare.net/folder/22091/)\n\nCJH_GoToSchool(BV+).package (from https://simfileshare.net/folder/22492/)\n\nCJH_BusStopSign.package (from https://simfileshare.net/folder/22492/)Tip: The .odt files are instructions on how to use the mod, and notes potential mod conflicts. Place the files into your game's Downloads folder. You may want to make a subfolder in your Downloads folder for the mods, so that they don't get separated. Open File Explorer {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/b\\/b1\\/WindowsFileExplorer.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/b\\/b1\\/WindowsFileExplorer.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":460,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":760,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>I edited this screenshot of a Windows icon.\\n<\\/p><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} or Finder {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/1\\/1d\\/Macfinder2.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/1\\/1d\\/Macfinder2.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":431,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":712.5,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>I edited this screenshot of a macOS icon.\\n<\\/p><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}. Navigate to Documents on the left-hand side of the window. Double-click the folder titled \"EA Games\". Double-click the folder titled \"The Sims 2\". Double-click the folder within your Sims 2 folder titled \"Downloads\". (If there's no Downloads folder, right-click the File Explorer or Finder window and create a new folder, and title it \"Downloads\".) Move all of the CJH package files into the Downloads folder. Variation: If you're running the Super Collection on a Mac, open Finder, then select \"Go\" in the toolbar at the top of your screen. Hold down Option and select \"Library\". Open the folder labeled Containers, then open com.aspyr.sims2.appstore, then open Data, and then the folder titled Library. Open the folder labeled Application Support, find and open the one labeled Aspyr, and then open the folder labeled The Sims 2. From there, you can open your game's Downloads folder. Open your game. Once you have all the necessary mods, you can start your game. If you haven't previously used custom content, click the box that says \"Enable custom content\", press OK, and then restart your game. Create a new community lot. You don't need to use any specific lot size, but it's best to keep the lot large enough for an outdoor space and small enough so that it doesn't take too long for Sims to cross the lot. Build your school on this lot. The mod requires at least two classrooms as well as playground equipment outdoors, but you can build your school any way you choose. Make two classrooms. Place at least twelve student desks in each. (The mod comes with a one-tile student desk, though any type of desk will work.) Place several bookshelves in the classroom. The mod will send Sims to study skills from books, so place multiple to avoid routing issues. Outside, place playground equipment (like swings or the playground tower from Apartment Life) so that Sims have a place to go for recess. Include restrooms so that Sims can use the bathroom, and fridges or vending machines so they can eat. Decorate as you see fit.Tip: Be sure to allow adequate space for Sims to walk through the classroom and access the desks; otherwise, they'll end up stamping their feet a lot. Place at least two teacher's desks. The mod comes with an orange teacher's desk, which has a vase of flowers on the corner. Place the first desk in the classroom intended for child Sims; this room will be the elementary school classroom. (The flowers on the desk will be white.) The second desk will go in the classroom for teen Sims, and will be the high school classroom; the flowers on the desk will be orange. You can place up to three desks on the lot; the third desk will serve as the headmaster's desk, and will have red flowers. However, placing further desks will cause the headmaster to have trouble figuring out which desk is his. Place a globe sculpture to zone the lot as a school. Once you've set up your school the way you want it, find the globe sculpture in Decorations > Sculptures. Click on it to zone your lot as a public school, and then place it somewhere on the lot. If you want to zone the lot as a private school, place two globes on the lot. Three globes will convert it back to public school. The mod will notify you of the school zoning when you click the globe in Buy Mode, so that you don't lose track.Warning: Only build one public school and one private school per neighborhood. If there are multiple public or private schools, the mod won't work. Save and exit the lot. After you've built and zoned the lot as a school, save your lot and exit to the neighborhood. The lot will show up as a residential lot - this is normal. Do not attempt to move in a family or change the lot zoning. Send a child or teen Sim to school. Once the mod recognizes a school of the appropriate type, the school bus will no longer come to the lot; instead, a taxi will come and get all students around 8:30 AM. If only teens go to school, they'll return at 1 PM; if there are only children, or if there are children and teens, they'll return at 3 PM. Sims need to all go to the same school. If some Sims are in private school and the others are in public school, the bus will come instead, because the mod can't figure out where to send the Sims. To deliberately keep the taxi from coming, place the bus stop sign on the lot (either outside or on a surface indoors). This sign triggers the bus to pick up and drop off the Sims as though the mod isn't installed. Use the community lot phone to send your Sim home if they miss the taxi after school. If your Sim misses the taxi to school, you can direct them to take a car to school or walk to school (if you have Apartment Life), but you won't be able to go to school with them. Manage your Sim's day at school. Your Sim will be prompted by the bells to go to and from class, and will autonomously study. You can choose what they study rather than letting the controller select it, or cancel out these actions and direct them to socialize with classmates or take care of their needs. If they leave the classroom, they'll be followed by a teacher (or the headmaster) and be scolded, then brought back into the classroom. Once the school day is over, the taxi will arrive to take your Sim back home. If your Sim skips out on studying, their grade will drop when they arrive home.",
