Porcelain is the hardest ceramic; bone china is nearly as strong because it is fortified by ox-bone ash. Both types are relatively expensive, and are often not ideal for dishwasher or microwave use because they are harder to replace. Many manufacturers now offer dishwasher-, microwave-, and oven-safe bone china and porcelain. Casual dinnerware should be sturdy, dishwasher-safe, and microwaveable; ideally, it should also be oven-safe to 400-500F. Such pieces are traditionally most often made of stoneware or earthenware (cream ware, majolica, faience, delft), which are less sturdy and less expensive than bone china or porcelain. However, porcelain and inexpensive bone china casual dinnerware is becoming quite common."

If you have a brightly-colored dining room, neutral colors will complement it well. If you have neutral-colored d\u00e9cor, you can incorporate a bright color into your dishes that will bring out other aesthetic accents. When considering patterns, include some plain dinnerware with your patterns so they aren't overwhelming.
