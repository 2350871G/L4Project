Use a brush or spatula to apply thin coats of the glue on the affected area until the chip is level with the rest of the surface. Leave the glue to cure for at least 24 hours. Do not apply too much at one go as it going to extend the curing time. Choose superglue with a thin consistency to treat chipped surfaces and a thicker one for chipped edges."

For the best result, you can mix the epoxy with a dye that is in the closest shade to the surface. Apply this mix to the chipped area in the thin coats till it is level with the rest of the countertop. Let it dry for 24 hours. The epoxy mix may shrink a bit while drying, so it's better to over-fill the chip and then sand down the excess later."
