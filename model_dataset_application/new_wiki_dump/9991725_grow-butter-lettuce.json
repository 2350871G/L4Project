          "description":"You can purchase the seeds for about $2.00-$5.00 per pack. You will likely only need to purchase one packet. Lettuce seeds are very small, so one packet will give you over 500 seeds. Because the seeds are so small, some brands make pelleted seeds. Pelleted seeds are covered in an organic clay coating. The extra layer makes the seeds more visible and easier to handle."

          "description":"Butter lettuce should get a minimum of 4-6 hours of direct sunlight a day, however, it will tolerate partial shade as well. It grows the best in temperatures between 45\u201365 \u00b0F (7\u201318 \u00b0C), but will tolerate temperatures as low as 20 \u00b0F (\u22127 \u00b0C) and as high as 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C). Lettuce grows best in cooler weather, making it most suitable for spring and fall harvests. If you're growing lettuce over the summer, then the heat may cause the crop to bolt, which will make it taste bitter. If you are planting the lettuce during warmer weather, shaded areas are a good option. The soil should be rich, smooth, and well-drained. If your soil is hard or clumpy, use a tiller to break it up and smooth it out. You can start your lettuce in planting trays indoors, but lettuce does really well when it\u2019s planted directly in the soil of your home garden."

Water the seeds thoroughly after planting. The seeds need light to germinate, so it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t cover them with a thick layer of soil. Plant new seeds in the open spaces every week or 2. This helps to space out your lettuce growth so you can enjoy your harvest over a longer period of time instead of all at once. Some gardeners opt to broadcast the seeds over the planting area. This method works, however, you can expect to have lots of small heads of lettuce that grow all at one time. This can make it difficult to use all of your harvest and often leads to a lot of waste."

Lettuce can also be affected by various types of fungi. Use garden nets or fencing to protect your lettuce from large pests like animals and birds. Organic neem oil works great to protect your plants from almost all types of insect pests. It is even effective in controlling aphids and caterpillars, which generally can\u2019t be controlled by other chemical insecticides. However, it's most effective on young plants. When using neem oil, you need to reapply it once a week to prevent damage caused by pests. You can also use neem oil if your lettuce suffers from fungal infections such as root rot, black spot, or sooty mold."
