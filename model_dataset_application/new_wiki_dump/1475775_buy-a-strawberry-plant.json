          "description":"June-bearing strawberry plants are the most common varieties because they bear large, healthy fruit over a period of two to three weeks. Typically, June-bearing strawberries produce one crop per season. June-bearing strawberries are further classified into early, middle, and later-bearing varieties. To extend your harvest, plant one of each plant so they bear fruit at different times. June-bearing strawberries are best to plant in the late springtime, at least a week after the last frost. They respond well to organic, low-nitrogen fertilizers. June-bearing varieties prefer warm temperatures, so apply a 6-8 inch (15-20 cm) layer of mulch over the plant through the wintertime. Popular June-bearing varieties include: Earliglow, Honeoye, Seneca, Jewel, and Kent."

In ideal everbearing climates (60\u00b0F to 80\u00b0F, or 15.56 \u00b0C to 26.66\u00b0C), everbearing plants can produce three harvests. Everbearing varieties thrive best in warmer climates where temperatures do not drop as frequently. Popular everbearing varieties include: Alexandria, Fraises des Bois, Weisse Solemacher, R\u00fcgen, and Muricata."

          "description":"June-bearing and everbearing varieties will take several years to reach their fullest harvest, but day-neutral plants produce good berries from their first year onward. Their berries, however, are usually smaller than other varieties. Day-neutral strawberry plants can be grown as annual or perennial plants. Annual have a life cycle of one harvesting season, while perennial plants regrow every spring. Day-neutral strawberries grow well when planted in late spring, and they enjoy cooler temperatures than other varieties. Popular day-neutral varieties include: Tristar, Albion, Tribute, Evie-2, and Seascape."

Spotting will look like tan, gray, or white spots. Once a plant is severely infected, very little can be done to reverse damage. Do not buy a plant with mild or moderate spotting. The fungus that causes spotting prefers hot, wet climates, so be on the lookout if you live in a humid environment."

Just remember to remove these insects before you plant it in your garden to avoid adding more pests to your garden. Because so many pests have been reported on strawberry plants, purchase garden-safe insect spray at the nursery when you purchase your plants."
