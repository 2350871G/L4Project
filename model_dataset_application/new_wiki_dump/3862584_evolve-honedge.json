You'll want to look in Route Six, which is the area connecting Route Seven to the Parfum Palace. Route Six is marked by two rows of shade trees along the sides of a central path. However, to find Honedge, you need to get to the tall grass behind the trees, which means entering the palace grounds and immediately exiting through one of the side paths. Note that Honedges appear approximately 15% of the time in the tall grass. You will probably have to fight a handful of Oddishes and Sentrets before you encounter a Honedge. It's also possible to get Honedge in Alpha Sapphire/Omega Ruby. However, this can only be done through trading. You can't catch Honedge in the wild in these games."

Once you get into a fight with one, get it down to a low HP level (without making it faint) and throw your best Pok\u00e9ball at it. The Honedges you will encounter will be about level 11 or 12, so the fight shouldn't be too difficult. However, here are some things you may want to know:\nHonedges are extra-weak versus ghost, fire, ground, and dark type attacks. Honedges are immune to normal, fighting, and poison type attacks. Honedges take normal damage from water and electric type attacks. Honedges take reduced damage from every other type."

Since you'll catch your Honedge at about level 11 or 12, you have about 23 or 24 levels to gain until it will evolve. This can take some time, but it will be a little faster if you use experience-boosting items like:\n\nExp.
