  "text":" Making the Crust Mix together the flour, sugar, and salt. Pour the flour, sugar, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Stir everything together until they are evenly combined. This will create a sweet-tasting crust. If you have a different crust recipe that you prefer to use, you can try that one instead. Cut the butter into the flour mixture using a pastry blender. Start by adding 3 tablespoons (45 grams) of butter into the flour mixture, then add the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of butter. The dough will be crumbly, which is fine. Pour in the cold water gradually, working it with your hands. Start with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water, knead the dough a little, then add the second tablespoon (15 milliliters). Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and leave it in the fridge for 30 minutes. Towards the end of the chilling period, you can start preheating your oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). This way, by the time you are done rolling, cutting, and forming the crusts, the oven will be the right temperature for baking. Roll out half of the dough to \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) thickness. Cut the dough in half first; this will make it more manageable. Roll out one of the halves to \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) thick. Save the other half for later. Cut circles out of the rolled out dough. The circles need to be about \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) bigger than the mason jar lids. You can use a glass or bowl that is the right size, or you can set the lid down on the dough, and cut \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeters) around it with a paring knife. Invert the Mason jar lids. Take a wide-mouth, two-part Mason jar lid. Pop out the bottom part and flip it over. Place it back into the ring, so that the rubbery part is on the outside and the metal part is on the inside. Do this for all six lids, then place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place the cut-out circles into the lids and pierce them with a fork. Place the circles into the lids first. Use your fingers to gently form them against the inside walls of the lids. When you are done, pierce the bottom of each crust 1 to 2 times with a fork. This will help the bottom stay flat when you bake it and prevent it from bubbling. Bake the crusts for 2 to 3 minutes at 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Preheat the oven first, then bake the crusts for 2 to 3 minutes. Take them out of the oven, and allow them to cool. Don't worry if they look under-baked; you will finish baking them later with the filling. Filling the Pies Combine all of the filling ingredients in a bowl. Stir them together with a rubber spatula until they are all mixed together. You can also use your own filling instead. In this case, prepare the filling according to your recipe. Allow the filling to rest for a few minutes. This allows the fruits to release their juices and the flavors to blend together. After a few minutes, give the filling another stir. Fill the baked crusts with your desired filling. Each pie gets about 1 to 3 tablespoons of filling. Avoid overfilling your pies, however, or they will burst while baking. Finishing the Pies Roll the remaining half of dough out to \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeter) thick. You will be using this batch of dough to make the upper crust for your pies. Cut circles out of the dough using a spare Mason jar lid. These circles will be going right on top of the pies, so they need to be the same size. If you know how to create a lattice crust, you can create one instead. Place the circles on top of each pie and pinch the edges to seal them. Gently place the cut circles on top of each pie. Use your fingers to pinch the edge of the upper crust against the edge of the baked crust. Use a paring knife to make three small slits in the center of each pie. These are the vent holes and will allow the steam to escape during backing. For a nicer touch, have all three slits point towards the center, like a start or three-petal flower. Coat the top of each pie with a beaten egg and sugar. Beat the egg in a cup with a fork or mini whisk. Use a pastry brush to coat the top of each pie with the beaten egg. Add a sprinkle of raw, chunky sugar over each pie before the egg wash dries. This is not absolutely necessary, but it will give your pies a nice touch. Bake the pies for 15 to 20 minutes. They are ready when they turn golden and the filling starts to bubble. Allow the pies to cool for 5 minutes before you serve them.
