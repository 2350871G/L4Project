In the even you have an uneven number of players, after dividing teams, have the team with one less player choose one team member to run the race twice. Generally, you shouldn't have a problem dividing crab race players into only two teams. With large groups, however, you may need to split players into more teams.

This person may want to go first and last, to allow for some rest time. Doing a Crab Race Clothing Relay Gather overly large articles of clothing for your game. These articles might include things like hats, scarves, overlarge shirts, pants, sunglasses, and so on. Each team should have a complete set of clothing. For example, if you have two teams you might collect two shirts, scarves, and hats for your race. Many suitable articles of clothing like this can be purchased inexpensively from secondhand or thrift stores, like Salvation Army and Goodwill. Organize your race as you would normally. Just like in a traditional crab race, you'll need to mark the start and finish and divide teams. If you have uneven teams, the team with one less player should choose one member to run the race twice. Distribute the clothing between teams. Each team should get one set of clothing apiece. Lay out these articles on the start line with a few feet (1 to 1.5 m) of distance between each team's collection of clothing articles. Start the relay. After you signal the start of the race (\"Ready, set, go! \"), players will put on the articles of clothing and race from the start to the finish and back again. When they return, they must take off the clothing and the next player must put it on before running the crab race. To make this game more challenging for older kids, you might add rules like, \"You have to button all the buttons on the shirt at the start and unbutton them at the finish.\" Rotate through players until one team finishes. Players should run the race one person at a time per team until all members have run the race. The first team to have all teammates complete the crab race clothing relay is the winner. Making Your Crab Race More Challenging Add obstacles to your racetrack. There are many different kinds of obstacles you can use to make your racetrack more challenging. For example, you could set up cones between the start and finish lines and have players weave back and forth between these. Team members not currently running the race can hold a hula hoop roughly a foot (.3 m) off the ground and have racing teammates clamber through this obstacle.
