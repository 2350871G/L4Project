Therefore, make sure that you only use a front-loading machine on the gentle cycle to protect the fabric from tears or snags. As an extra precaution, set the washing machine on low heat as well. Keeping the water temperature under 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C) will help protect the synthetic fabric from damage. Avoid putting anything else in the wash with your jacket to protect the fabric."

Synthetic insulated jackets are sensitive to most detergents, as these tend to contain fragrances and harsh chemicals that can damage the insulation. You can also use fragrance-free Woolite, as it tends to be gentle enough on synthetic insulation."

You may need to rinse the jacket several times to get all the soap suds out of the fabric. Once the soap is rinsed out, squeeze out as much water as you can without wringing it, as this can cause the insulation to clump. Air drying your jacket allows moisture to stay trapped in the insulation, which can cause it to mildew. Therefore, it\u2019s best to dry your jacket in the dryer after hand-washing it."

Tumble dry the jacket, checking the dryer every 20 minutes. Press the start button to start the low heat dryer cycle.
