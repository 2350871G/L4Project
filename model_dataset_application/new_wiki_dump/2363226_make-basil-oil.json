You can use basil fresh from your garden, from the supermarket, or from a local farmer's market. Basil comes in many varieties. The kind you can most easily find in the United States is sweet basil, which is perfect for use in Italian dishes and soups. Sweet Thai basil is often used in Asian cooking; it is slightly spicier with hints of licorice and cloves. Lemon basil has hints of lemon along with the typical sweet basil flavors. Purple basil types, such as dark opal basil or purple ruffles basil, are also spicier than sweet basil. You can use any of these basil types for your basil oil; it just depends on your taste preference and how you want to use the oil."
