On the side, you can season the steak with salt and pepper. Remove the grilled garlic and then place the steak in the pan. Grill it, along with the vegetables. Flip the steak over when it's slightly browned. Carefully pour sake in the pan for extra flavor. Cover the pan with a lid to steam the vegetables and remove the lid in a few minutes. For additional flavor on top of the sake, pour and distribute the soy sauce on the vegetables. Remove from the heat when everything is done cooking."
