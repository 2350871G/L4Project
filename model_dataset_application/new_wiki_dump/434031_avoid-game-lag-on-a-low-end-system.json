One way to improve a game's performance is by toning down its graphical settings; while this will noticeably reduce your game's visual presentation, it will also reduce the amount of information on the screen, thereby allowing a faster FPS rate. If the game with which you're experiencing trouble is an online-based game, you must be connected to the Internet to continue. Open the game's Settings.
