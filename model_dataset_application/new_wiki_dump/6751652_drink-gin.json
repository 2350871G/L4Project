          "description":"Drinking a spirit neat means you drink it without any additional preparation. This means no chilling, no ice, and no mix. To enjoy gin this way, pour a standard shot, which is 1\u00bd ounces (44 ml), of gin into an old fashioned cocktail glass. Drink the gin slowly and in small sips so you can appreciate the flavors. Modern gins are brewed in a variety of ways and with many different ingredients. Flavors you may taste when you sip your gin include florals, berries, citrus hints, and herbs. An old fashioned cocktail glass is a short and wide glass that holds 6 to 8 ounces (177 to 237 ml) of liquid."

          "description":"When you order a drink up, it means you want it chilled but served without ice. To do this, pour a shot of gin into a martini shaker filled with ice. Put on the lid and shake the gin thoroughly to combine it with the ice. Remove the lid, leaving the strainer on the martini shaker, and pour the gin into your cocktail glass. Enjoy the gin slowly, and try to pick out the flavors that make the gin unique. Instead of chilling the gin with ice cubes, you can also freeze the bottle for a few hours to chill it. While the alcohol won\u2019t freeze, it will make the gin a little thicker. As the gin warms, it will become less viscous and the flavors will become more apparent. Another name for this drink is a bone-dry gin martini."

Before taking a sip, swirl the gin and ice cubes around in the glass a few times to help chill the gin. As always, sip the gin slowly. You can also use chilled whiskey stones instead of ice cubes. These are special rocks that you freeze, and that cool your drink without watering it down."
