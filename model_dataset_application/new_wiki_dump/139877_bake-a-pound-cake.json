This step is very important; if you skip it, you may not get the consistency your batter needs to be. Gradually add sugar and continue to mix until thick and creamy. This will be easiest if your butter isn't straight out of the fridge. Don't heat it up -- but do give it a few minutes to start nearing room temperature."

Mace is not pepper spray -- though that would make for an interesting pound cake. On the contrary, it comes from the shell of nutmeg; if you don't have it, nutmeg can substitute (but mace has a more intense flavor). Add in the flour slowly. All at once and you'll be climbing (err, mixing your way to) an uphill battle. Add it in bit by bit."

If to be used for fancy ornamented cakes, bake 30 to 35 minutes in a dripping-pan. Insert a skewer or toothpick to see if it's finished. If it comes out dry, it is.
