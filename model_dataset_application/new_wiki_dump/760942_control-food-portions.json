      "description":"Filling up on lightly dressed salads or a bowl of vegetables or low fat chicken soup before main meals is an effective way to keep you from overeating. The fiber in the vegetables will help to curb your appetite and leave you feeling satisfied sooner. Try combining a salad as a starter and a nourishing soup as your main meal."

      "description":"We all have foods that are simply too irresistible to avoid. Whatever your temptation, it\u2019s very important for you to occasionally treat yourself. However, try to limit this to once a week. These days there are a lot of products that come in bite-sizes, so it\u2019s best to indulge in one of these small servings when needed."

      "headline":"Eat smart when dining out.",
      "description":"Eating at a restaurant does not mean you should consume the largest portion available. Rather share a meal with your dining partner, or try ordering a starter meal as your main meal. You can also order a half portion or a children\u2019s portion. Although not all restaurants will charge less for half portions, your waistline will thank you later."

We use food \u2013 especially carbohydrates \u2013 to deal with energy slumps and while you might get a quick burst of energy, this will soon fade. Being well rested will keep that \u201cafternoon slump\u201d at bay and keep you away from temptation. Studies also indicate that fatigue stimulates the production of the hunger inducing hormone, Ghrelin in the human body. If you tend to eat when you are not hungry, try doing something to distract you from the temptation to eat."

This will help you to identify the times you eat too much and why, so that you can adjust your diet accordingly. You can also rotate your food schedules each week to break up the monotony."
