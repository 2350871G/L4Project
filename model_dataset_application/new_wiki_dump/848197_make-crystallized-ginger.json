          "description":"You need to remove the skin from the ginger before crystallizing it, and one of the easiest ways to do this is with a spoon. Place the side of the spoon against the ginger root, and gently scrape away the skin. You can use a knife or vegetable peeler for this job instead. Vegetable peelers can be awkward to maneuver around all the knobs and bumps on ginger, and knives often take off too much flesh."

          "description":"Set your mandolin to one-eighth inch (3 mm). Place the ginger on the board and use the pusher to run the ginger over the blade. Collect the ginger slices and place them into a large saucepan. Use a sharp knife to slice the ginger into thin rounds if you don\u2019t have a mandolin. You can also cut the ginger into small cubes if you prefer."

          "headline":"Boil the ginger.",
          "description":"Add the water to the saucepan with the ginger slices. Put the lid on, and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. When the water boils, reduce the temperature to medium and simmer for 30 minutes. The ginger is ready when it\u2019s tender to the touch and can easily be pierced with a fork. When the ginger is cooked, remove the pan from the heat."

          "description":"Remove about 1 cup (237 ml) of water from the saucepan and set it aside. Pour the ginger into a strainer to drain out the rest of the water. Return the ginger to the pot, along with the cup of water you reserved."

          "description":"Add the sugar to the pot with the ginger and water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring regularly to prevent burning. When the mixture boils, reduce the heat to medium. Continue cooking, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, until the syrup reaches 225 F (107 C). When the syrup reaches the right temperature, remove the pan from the heat immediately. You can substitute honey in place of the sugar to make this recipe."

          "description":"Place the greased cooling rack on top of a baking sheet. Spread the ginger pieces out over the cooling rack, letting the extra syrup fall down onto the baking sheet. With a fork, gently separate the ginger pieces so they can dry and cool. Set the ginger aside to cool for one to two hours. You want the ginger pieces sticky enough that sugar will adhere to them, but not so wet that the coating will slide off."

          "description":"When the ginger is cool enough to handle, transfer the slices to a large bowl. Sprinkle in enough sugar to coat the ginger pieces in a thin layer of sugar. Toss or stir to distribute the sugar evenly and coat the slices. Transfer the ginger back to the cooling rack. Let the slices sit overnight to cool completely."

Ginger sugar can be used in hot drinks like tea and cold drinks like lemonade. You can also use ginger sugar to coat the rim of glasses when you make cocktails.
