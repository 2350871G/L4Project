          "description":"Cream is one of the easiest thickeners to use in soup. Add it near the end of cooking the soup. Let it simmer gently for about 10 minutes, and the soup will thicken up with the cream. Try a couple of spoonfuls up to a 1 cup (240 mL), depending on how creamy you want it. If you leave the cream in too long and the soup boils, it can curdle in your soup, which is why it's best to add it at the end. Half and half or even whole milk will also work for this purpose."

          "description":"Use plain yogurt. Both whole milk and fat free will work, though you'll get a richer soup with whole milk. Spoon it into the soup near the end, and let it simmer for a few minutes to thicken. Yogurt will change the flavor of your soup more dramatically than cream, as it is much tangier. It works well in spring-type soups, such as potato soup, tomato soup, butternut squash soup, and avocado soup."

          "description":"If you crave creaminess but don't want to use milk or eggs, coconut milk is an excellent choice. Coconut milk tends to be more stable than cream, so you can add it any time during the cooking process, though near the end is probably best. Coconut cream is much thicker than coconut milk, so choose which one to use based on how thick you want your soup. Coconut can add a subtle coconut flavor for the soup, which works really well in soups with Asian flavors, such as Thai soups."

          "headline":"Stir in whole, beaten eggs for a creamy, savory addition.",
          "description":"Beat a couple of eggs in a bowl, thoroughly whisking them until they are fully incorporated and light and frothy. Take a small cup of broth from the soup. Pour it in a gentle into the egg mixture while you whisk vigorously at the same time. Once the hot soup is incorporated, pour the whole mixture back into the soup. Pouring hot soup into the eggs is known as tempering them, which keeps them from curdling in your soup.Tip: For a richer soup, just use the egg yolks. If you prefer a lighter soup, use only the egg whites."

Rip it into chunks that are about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) wide or just throw in a whole slice if it's pre-sliced. Let the soup simmer until the bread dissolves. Another option is bread crumbs. Just stir in small amounts until you reach the thickness you want. Corn tortillas or tortilla chips also work well. Stale bread is great for this purpose."

Let it boil for 10 minutes or so, then check the consistency before adding more. This addition works best in soups like potato or garlic. It will also work in tomato, but you should go slowly when adding oats, as it can overpower the flavor of the tomato."

Pour it into the hot soup near the end to thicken it. Allow the soup to simmer for 10 minutes or so, while you stir it often.Tip: Meat soups have a stronger flavor than more delicate soups.

Once it's liquidy enough to pour or scrape, add it into the soup and whisk it in thoroughly. Some soups start with a roux, or call for a much darker roux.
