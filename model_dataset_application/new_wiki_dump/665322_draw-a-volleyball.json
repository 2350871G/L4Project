If you want, you can use a coin, or other round object, to trace and make the circle totally perfect. Draw a dot in the center of the circle. This will be used as a starting point to draw the other lines on the volleyball. Draw three lines on the volleyball, starting from the dot, and extending outwards to the edge of the circle. The lines should all be slightly curved in the same direction. The circle you drew should now be split into three sections. Draw two lines within each section. Both of the lines should be parallel matching the curvature of the other lines that you have already drawn. Add details, if you want to. For example, you could write \"Mikasa\",\"Molten\" ,\"Tachikara\" , \"Wilson\" , or \"Baden\" on the volleyball. You can even add any color you would like.",
