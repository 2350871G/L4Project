Look for larger than average apples that are firm to the grasp and have no bruising or damage. Purchase enough ingredients so you can make more than what the recipe calls for--these sweet delights won't last long. Check your kitchen for tools you need to create the apples or head to the kitchen and bath store to pick up certain items. Sharp knives to not only cut apple in half but help cut the inside of the apple. Melon ball scoop to refine and create your well inside the apple. Saucepan, candy thermometer parchment paper and cookie sheet. You'll create the caramel sauce in the pan and pour it into waiting apples sitting on a parchment paper laden cookie sheet. Use the candy thermometer to determine the exact temperature while making the caramel sauce. Cut the apples in half lengthwise. Make a clean cut down the middle. You will need to use a very sharp knife. Slide a smaller knife around the inside of the apple, traveling near the outer edges (near the skin). Make a few hash marks into the apple flesh (not on the skin). Dig into the apple centers with your melon ball scoop. Scoop out the middle of the apple, but be careful to leave some flesh near the edges (for a better hold of the caramel). Cut the lemon in half and squeeze juice over the cut, prepare the apple slices to preserve the apple color and texture (the oxidation process will begin to turn the apple brown immediately without the lemon).  Pat inside and outside of apple with a paper towel to remove excessive lemon juice.

Check apples to ensure they are still a golden color, have not turned brown but are also not carrying excessive lemon juice. Pour cooled caramel into hollowed out apples and fill just below the top edges.  Sprinkle each apple with pecan nuts or any other nut or candy at this stage. Work quickly before the caramel sets.
