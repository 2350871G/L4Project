Before doing any other cleaning, remove surface dust and debris by blowing on your glasses, then (if necessary) running them under warm water. If there is salt residue (from seawater) or any other type of abrasive material on your glasses, be sure to rinse them thoroughly with water before doing any type of rubbing. Rub the lenses with your microfiber cloth while they are still wet from the rinsing, or while still under the running water. Use only as much pressure as needed to remove dirt and smudges. The old-time method of breathing warm, damp air on your lenses and gently wiping them clean is acceptable for quick, minor cleanings. Make sure the lens is moistened all over, however."

Especially when dealing with polarized lenses, the answer is no. Commercial soaps, household cleaners, and especially window cleaners can contain chemicals that will slowly but surely dissolve the coating on your glasses. This will leave them cloudy and less effective at reducing glare. Manufacturers of several popular brands of polarized glasses have specific recommendations for the use of lens cleaners. These include:\nBuying their own branded cleaner or choosing one with a pH level between 5.5 and 8. Buying a (different company\u2019s) branded cleaner or using another with less than five percent alcohol content. Avoiding the use of cleaners entirely in favor of plain old warm water."
