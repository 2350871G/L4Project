Selecting a historically significant date will help you incorporate the 1940s theme into decorations and activities. Consider:\nThe premier of the film Casablanca, November 26, 1942\nWinston Churchill\u2019s birthday, November 30. The end of war in Europe, May 8, 1945. The day Indonesia declared independence, August 17, 1945."

          "description":"Consider renting space at a historical location to reinforce your theme. If nearby venues don\u2019t work, you can always hold the party in your own home. Just make sure that whatever space you select has enough room to host all of your guests. Old movie theatres, historic hotels, museums, or historic bars make great venues for a 1940s party. Try to find a location that was in operation during the 1940s, any site that feels historical and has enough space will work."

          "description":"Invitations need to convey important information about location, time, date, and how to RSVP, but they should also help get your guests excited about your theme. To achieve this goal, create invitations that reflect the style and themes of the 1940s. Make sure to use the invitation to communicate special instructions to guests, such as instructions for dressing in 1940s style clothing. Make your invitations look like the front page of a historical newspaper by using the same style and font as a 1940s paper. Or consider using an old propaganda poster\u2014like the iconic \u201cI Want You\u201d poster featuring Uncle Sam--and add your guests\u2019 names to it. You can check online for templates! If you want your guests to dress in 1940s fashions, you can find old 1940s clothing catalogues online, print a few pages, and include them in your invitations. Or create a website with instructions and provide the link on your invitation. Don\u2019t forget to include makeup and hair suggestions!"

After searching for historic images, find a few that you\u2019d like to enlarge and either print them yourself or visit a print shop to have them made professionally. Hang these posters on the venue walls or from the ceiling with string. Alternatively, have images printed on cardstock and prop them up against easels or furniture. Consider movie posters from 1940s films like: Casablanca, Citizen Kane, or Yankee Doodle Dandy. You can also print posters of iconic musicians like Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra. Consider surrounding these posters with old records or musical instruments like horns.

Rent one from a party supply store, or make your own by setting up a space in the corner of your venue. You can either partition your DIY photo booth with curtains, or you can simply set up a backdrop with paper and decorations. The most important thing is to have instant cameras, like Polaroid\u2019s, available. Also get props--like hats, purses, and gloves--which you can find in antique stores, thrift shops, or online."

Popular 1940s musicians and bands included: Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day, and Frank Sinatra. If you can find a skilled DJ, ask them to try and mix audio clips from old radio broadcasts, films, or songs clips with contemporary music."

Edit the footage to create a montage of 1940s clips to play on loop the day of your party. If you need help editing the film, search for online tutorials, ask a friend, or check out the media help desk at your nearest public library. On the day of your party, project the footage onto a wall or white sheet. Alternatively, you can use a large screen or television, but a projected video will appear grainier, so it'll have a more historic look. You probably want to set the footage on silent, so guests can converse with one another and enjoy other music or entertainment."

Another way to incorporate some of your favorite appetizers into your theme is to pair them with a hot sauce since Tabasco sauce became popular in the 1940s.

Most countries implemented strict rationing policies during the war. Chicken, for example, was hard to find in many countries, so avoid chicken dishes. And many cooks had to get creative with food substitutes when faced with shortages in butter, eggs, or even flour. In the Unites States, meat was rationed heavily, so cooks had to try and make organ meats like livers and hearts palatable to diners.
