          "description":"Cranium is a game that is played in teams. To play the game, you'll need at least four players so you have at least two teams. Divide people up into teams at the beginning of the game. As there is no limit on how many players per team, Cranium can be fun to play in big groups. You could play with 4 groups of 3 to 4 players, for example, if you're looking for a board game for a party night. However, you can play in small groups as well. As long as there are at least two teams, the game is still playable. Cranium is a versatile game, so you can adjust team size based on your personal game night needs."

          "description":"After you've established teams, there are certain supplies you'll need to play Cranium. Make sure all the teams have the right supplies before the game begins. Choose a playing piece. Your copy of Cranium should come with a variety of pieces. Different versions of Cranium will have different kinds of game pieces. Allow each team to choose the piece he or her wants to play Cranium. You will also make sure every team member has a paper and a pen or pencil. Cranium should come with some paper and pencils in the box. If you run out, you can use any kind of scrap paper you have lying around your house. Just make sure all players have materials to write with as you'll need them for a variety of activities in Cranium. Cranium boxes usually come with a small bit of clay, used in certain activities. If the clay is missing or dried out, you could replace it with a bit of play-dough purchased at the supermarket. You could also simply not play cards that require clay."

However, if that team does not successfully complete the activity their turn is passed to the team on the left."

There should be a small hourglass timer that comes with cranium that allows players one minute to complete the activity. If you do not have your timer, you can use a watch or phone to keep track of time. One type of card is the creative cat. The creative cat card involves a creative activity. You may use the clay to make a sculpture and have another player guess what you're sculpting. You may also do a Pictionary-type drawing activity. Unless otherwise specified on the card, you can choose which team member performs the activity. When playing Creative Cat, it's a good idea to pick a more artistically inclined player. If someone is good at drawing or sculpting, allowing that person to engage in the activity will give your team a better chance at winning."

To successfully complete this activity, you need to answer the questions correctly. Choose a player with a knack for trivia to complete this activity. If someone is good at something like bar trivia or Trivial Pursuit, they'll be your best bet for this activity. If you're chosen for a Data Head activity and you don't know the answer, go with your gut response. Many times, trivia answers are things we've learned at some point but do not consciously remember. If you have a gut feeling one answer is right, take a shot. You should be especially willing to take this risk if the answer is multiple choice or True/False. You'll have a 25-50% chance of being correct."

Pick a player with a good vocabulary for this card. People who read a lot or who write for a living might be better at defining or unscrambling words. If anyone on your team has a background in etymology or linguistics, choose them for this activity. Oftentimes, the roots used in words offer a hint to their meaning.

The other player has to guess what song you are humming. If you have a Humdinger, you should pick someone that is able to carry. Also choose someone who knows popular music. Someone who's a classically trained pianist could potentially be great at humming. However, if this person has spent his whole life playing Chopin he might not know the tune to a Bruce Springsteen song offhand. Copycat cards require you to act like a famous person. Pick a team member who's fun-loving, uninhibited, and somewhat dramatic. The more someone is willing to put themselves out there and perform, the better chance you have of guessing the answer. As with a humdinger card, make sure it's someone well acquainted with pop culture so they'll recognize the name on the card. Cameo cards are similar to charades in which you have to get the other player to guess a particular person, place, or thing by silently acting out clues.
