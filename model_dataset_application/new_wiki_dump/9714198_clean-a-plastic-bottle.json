  "text":" Using Dish Soap and Water Add a few drops of dish soap and water to your bottle then put the cap back on. Any hand dish liquid is fine to use for washing a plastic bottle.

It is recommended to wash your bottle in the evening so you can leave it out overnight to air dry. If you can\u2019t do this, dry your bottle completely with a clean towel before using. Cleaning in the Dishwasher Check your bottle for a dishwasher-safe symbol. Most products today are safe in the dishwasher but check your bottle just to be sure. Take the top parts off of the bottle and be sure those go into the dishwasher too. Load your bottle into the top rack of your dishwasher. Plastic items should go into the top rack of a dishwasher.
