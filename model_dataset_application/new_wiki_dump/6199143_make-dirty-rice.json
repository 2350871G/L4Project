When the liquid is boiling, add the rice and reduce the heat to medium. Cook the rice, covered, for 20 minutes. Remove the rice from the heat and set it aside. You can use any white rice you like in this recipe, such as jasmine or basmati. You can also use brown rice if you prefer, though dirty rice usually uses white."

Use the side of a spoon to break up the meat into evenly sized pieces. Heat the beef for a minute or two, until the bottom starts to brown. You can also cook the beef in bacon fat for an even richer dirty rice, or cook 5 pieces of chopped bacon with the ground beef. Breaking up the meat is important to ensure the meat cooks evenly."
