Remember, you must take care of all new things. E.g. you buy a new dog. You must take care of it. Taking care uses your energy. So make sure, your dog gives the energy back to you. And this energy comes with joy. When you enjoy being with your dog, you get energy from it. If not, you waste it. So everything new you bring to your life must be joy for you and in balance with your journey and vision."

      "headline":"Remember that Home is very important source of energy.",
      "description":"It has the same energy as your body. Therefore the quality of your home influences quality of your body, your health. Therefore make sure your home is in harmony not only with you, but again with your journey and vision. If your home is in harmony, it gives you lots of energy and support. Do not forget: you spend min 8 hours a day at home (just because you sleep there). But most people do not just sleep at home, they eat there, spend time with family, watch TV etc. So it may very well be, you spend half of your life at home. So imagine how big influence it has. Make sure your home Feng Shui is right and correct."
