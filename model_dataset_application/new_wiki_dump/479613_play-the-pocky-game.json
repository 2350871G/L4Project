          "description":"Pocky are sweet Japanese cookies that come in many flavors. You can find them at your local Asian market or in the international aisle at a grocery store. Milk chocolate is the most popular flavor, but you can also find Pocky in other flavors too, such as matcha (green tea), strawberry, and cookies 'n cream. If you can\u2019t find Pocky, any long, thin biscuit, such as a breadstick, will do."

Then, the winners of both games can face off in their own Pocky game. The Pocky game often results in a kiss, so it makes sense to pick a partner you wouldn\u2019t mind kissing to begin with. You can use this as an opportunity to break the ice with your crush or bring you closer to a good friend."

You might say, \u201cHas anyone played the Pocky game before?\u201d You\u2019ll either be met with enthusiasm or curiosity. Either way, you\u2019ll have a captive audience to teach the rules. You can also play the game at other occasions too, such as sleepovers."

If you don\u2019t have access to a toothbrush at the party, chewing a stick of mint gum for a little bit would do. Spit the gum out before you begin to play so that it doesn't get stuck on the Pocky. Make sure that you are in good health. Don't play this game if you are sick. Brushing alone won't get rid of those germs."

One player then does a countdown backwards from three to begin play. Only one side of the Pocky stick is covered with chocolate. The other side isn't. It doesn't matter who has the chocolate side.

If you drop the Pocky stick, then grab another. If this is in a group, then you could both \"lose\" and be out of the game."

It can be kind of funny to be so close to someone, so try not to giggle and lose your bit of the Pocky stick. Often, neither party will turn away, resulting in the kiss. In that case, everyone wins!"
