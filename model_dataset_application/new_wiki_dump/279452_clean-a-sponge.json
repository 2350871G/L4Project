Don\u2019t squeeze or wring the sponge, since you want to keep as much water in it as possible. Place the wet sponge in a glass, plastic, or ceramic bowl that's safe to go in the microwave. If you don't have a microwave-safe bowl, you can place the sponge on a paper towel to catch any water that comes out of the sponge in the microwave.Caution: Never microwave sponges that have metal or plastic scrubbers, as these can be fire or electrocution hazards in the microwave. It's best to wash these sponges using the dishwasher or by soaking them in a bleach solution."
