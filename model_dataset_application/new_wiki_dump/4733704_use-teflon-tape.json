James Schuelke\t\t\tProfessional Plumber\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: You always want to apply the tape in the direction of the threads you're putting on, which is almost always clockwise. Wrap the tape about 5 or 6 turns, then add a little pipe dope on top of that before you put in your plumbing fitting."

If it does, peel the tape off of the threads, trim the used strip from your roll, and try again. Cover the pipe\u2019s edge with one layer of tape, following the direction that the threads run (clockwise or counterclockwise). Once you complete a full circuit, wrap a second layer of tape over the first. Stray bits of tape that stick over the pipe\u2019s edge will end up in the pipeline when the two pipes are connected. They may then block the flow of water or gas, causing clogs and/or weak pressure. Pull the tape taut as you unroll it to ensure a tight fit.
