Place staples 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) apart in the felt."

      "description":"Place the drip edge horizontally against the edge of the roof to mark a distance. The curved-out edge should fit over the roof overhang. The \"flat\" part may have embossed grooves/beads to add strength to the strip. Use chalk along the inner/upper edge of the drip edge to mark where the drip edge lays on the felt. Set the drip edge aside. Measure 3/8 inch (~ 1 cm) downward from the chalk marking towards the roof edge. This is to space the drip edge out from the roof edge that distance, evenly and consistently. Mark this distance with chalk. Align the inner edge of the drip edge with the marked lines on the felt. You are not aligning the edge against the roof edge, but by following the marked line\nNail the drip edge to the felt and roof with galvanized roofing nails."

      "headline":"Secure new shingles.",
      "description":"Nail a horizontal row of shingles over the drip edge. Hammer the nail into the top part of each shingle. The shingles should jut out from 1/4 to 3/8 inch (.7 to 1 cm) over the drip edge. Continue to nail horizontal rows of shingles onto the roof. Each row should overlap the one below it by 1/4 inch (~ .7 cm), not less. The center of each shingle in each row should lay directly above the edge of the shingle in the row below it. You will have an offset pattern in the shingles, so that the edges of the shingles do not line up vertically."
