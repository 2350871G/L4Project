Then, once you've completely removed the superglue, wash the piece of clothing as usual to remove the acetone. Nail polish removers traditionally have acetone, though some removers are acetone-free. Check yours before attempting to use it. You can also try applying laundry detergent to the stain and letting it sit a few minutes before washing."

Once it's thoroughly mixed, rub the mixture into the skin where the superglue is and let it sit for 15 minutes. Then, after 15 minutes, wash your skin with soap and water to remove. You can also try other vegetable oils by themselves or even petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment. The oil may be enough to dissolve the glue. Rubbing alcohol may also work."
