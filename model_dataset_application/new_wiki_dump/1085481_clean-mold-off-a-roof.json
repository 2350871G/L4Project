Without them, the chemicals you\u2019ll be using to treat your roof shingles can irritate your eyes and airways. For your own safety, put on all necessary safety equipment before you get on the roof and leave it on for the duration of the project."

          "headline":"Dress appropriately for the job.",
          "description":"Protective clothing, including pants and a long-sleeved shirt, will keep your skin from coming into contact with bleach and other harsh chemicals. A pair of slip-resistant work boots or shoes designed for outdoor use are also a must to ensure that you\u2019ll have proper traction on the slippery, mold-covered shingles. Walking around on the roof is precarious enough without the added danger of mold-covered shingles. It may be a good idea to change into an old set of clothes that you don\u2019t mind dirtying up."

          "description":"Runoff from the chemicals can harm healthy vegetation. One way around this is to mist surrounding trees and shrubs with a garden hose to prevent the chemicals from sticking. If you don\u2019t want to take any chances, you could also cover your prized flower bed or vegetable garden with a plastic tarp. Wet your plants down twice\u2014once before you begin cleaning the roof and again when you\u2019re finished."

          "headline":"Take the proper safety precautions when climbing onto the roof.",
          "description":"Find a stable stretch of ground and position a sturdy ladder there. Make sure the spot you choose grants you direct access to the roof, with no awkward obstructions to get in the way. Climb each rung slowly, one at a time, until you can make your transition to the roof. A solid surface like concrete will make the best base for your ladder, but a patch of grass and dirt is also okay as long as it's perfectly level. If possible, recruit a helper to hold the ladder while you\u2019re on it. A safety harness can be a wise investment for big roofs that require more time and effort to clean."

          "headline":"Maneuver with caution.",
          "description":"Angled rooftops can be steeper than they look. It will be crucial to watch your step at all times. Keep your eyes on your feet as you\u2019re making your way around the roof, and avoid putting your full weight down until you\u2019re confident that your footing is secure. If you\u2019re not careful, the slightest miscalculation could result in a fall. Don\u2019t take any unnecessary risks, especially when stepping on and off the ladder. Stick closely to the ridge where the two sloped sides of the roof come together. This area will offer the greatest support."

          "description":"To get rid of mold and other types of growth for good, it\u2019s best to use a powerful chemical agent like chlorine bleach. You can whip up your own basic cleaner by combining one quart of bleach, one gallon of water, and \u00bc cup (60ml) of trisodium phosphate (TSP). For maximum coverage, use a pump sprayer to disperse the solution. The chlorine will kill the mold-causing bacteria while the TSP will help remove stains and discoloration. Never combine bleach with any product containing ammonia. This can produce toxic chlorine gas which can be extremely hazardous to breathe. If you\u2019d rather minimize your handling of chemicals, keep an eye out for preformulated treatments such as Wet & Forget or Moss Out at your local home improvement center.
