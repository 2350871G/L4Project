Once you create your daily and weekly cleaning schedules, keep to it to make sure your good cleaning habits sink in and stick. If you miss a day of cleaning for whatever reason, address the chores you missed as soon as possible the next day to prevent duties and messes from building up. Try to turn cleaning into a game if you really don't like it. Challenge yourself to clean your room as fast as possible and try to beat your previous best.",
