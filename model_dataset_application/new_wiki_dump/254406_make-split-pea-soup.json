Either way, you have two options when adding it to the soup:\n\nSimmer the ham in a pot of water, skimming and discarding the foam. Cook for about one hour before you start boiling the peas. Alternatively, cook the ham in the same pot as the peas. This is faster, but adds less meaty flavor. There's also some risk of overcooking the peas to mush, as the meat can take 1\u20132 hours to become tender (falling off the bone)."

Use vegetable stock in place of all or part of the water, perhaps with a splash of wine (red or white). Try additional herbs such as rosemary and thyme. Acidic ingredients such as tomatoes and wine can make the peas take longer to soften. These are most likely fine in small amounts, but you can add them late in the cooking process if you want to be safe."

If they've been in storage for a while, they may take up to 90 minutes or even 2 hours. Aim to add the vegetables about 30 minutes before the peas are finished. (When in doubt, add them 20 minutes after the peas started simmering.) Add the bay leaf and other herbs immediately, plus a pinch of salt.
