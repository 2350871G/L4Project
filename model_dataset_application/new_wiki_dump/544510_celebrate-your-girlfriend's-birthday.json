However, if the day falls during the week, it\u2019s usually best to move it to the weekend so guests don\u2019t have to worry about getting up for school or work in the morning. You can choose the weekend before or after her birthday, depending on which is closest to the actual day. If you\u2019re planning to throw a surprise party, try to pick a date before your girlfriend\u2019s birthday. The further away from the actual day, the less that she\u2019ll be expecting it."

However, if you want a more formal party, you may want to rent a catering hall or hotel function room. Many restaurants have party rooms available too, which can be convenient if you just want a simple party. You can also opt for a destination party by celebrating your girlfriend\u2019s birthday at a venue that hosts a specific activity, such as a bowling alley, an arcade, or a pottery studio."

          "description":"To make the event special for your girlfriend, it helps to come up with a fun theme for the party. It can be something simple, such as her favorite cartoon characters, or something more elaborate. In warm weather, you might hold the party outdoors and go with a tropical theme where all the guests wear Hawaiian shirts. If she\u2019s a fan of gambling, you might choose a Monte Carlo or Las Vegas theme. Tailor it to your girlfriend\u2019s specific interests. After you choose a theme, don\u2019t just make the decorations match it. Have all of the elements, including the food, entertainment, and music, fit it as closely as possible. If there\u2019s a movie that your girlfriend loves, make that the theme of the party. Have all the guests dress up as characters from the film. A carnival theme can be fun. Make fair-worthy foods, such as corn dogs, snow cones, and popcorn, and set up some games, such as a ring toss. A murder mystery party is a fun idea if your girlfriend likes detective stories. Let the guests know ahead of time, though, so they can get in character and dress up."

If you\u2019re not an experienced cook, it\u2019s usually best to keep it simple by making a basic pasta dish. To get some inspiration, visit a few cooking websites and skim the recipes until you find the perfect options for your girlfriend.

Make the meal a little more special by adding a marinade to the steak, such as soy sauce, lemon and garlic, or a balsamic vinaigrette. Roast chicken can be an easy recipe to follow if you swap a whole chicken for several individual skin on, bone-in pieces instead. Place them in a baking dish with your favorite marinade and roast until they're brown. Add your girlfriend's favorite vegetable or starch side dish, and you have an elegant, but simple dinner.

You should also figure out if you need any other reservations for the trip, such as for dinner at a trendy restaurant, tickets for a show, or admittance to a local attraction. Make sure to plan ahead, so you\u2019re not making reservations at the last minute. You may wind up with limited options if you wait too long to plan the trip. If you\u2019re not sure if you need other reservations, speak to the staff at the hotel. They can usually help you figure out what you might want to plan ahead. Create a gift box that goes with the destination. You\u2019ll want to have something to give to your girlfriend on her birthday, so put together a gift package that hints at the trip\u2019s location. For example, if you\u2019re taking her for a weekend of vineyard tours, put together a basket that includes a map of the area, a couple of bottles of her favorite wine, and a monogrammed wineglass. For a weekend away at the beach, put some sunscreen, sunglasses, flip flops, and a towel inside a beach bag for her. If your destination doesn\u2019t lend itself to a gift box, just print out your itinerary or reservation confirmation, place it in a box, and wrap it for your girlfriend to open.",
