Keep the creamer or milk in your fridge and add 1\u20133 teaspoons (4.9\u201314.8 mL) to your coffee based on your personal preference. Alternatively, add cream after ordering a cup at the local coffee shop. The cold milk or creamer will instantly lower the temperature of the coffee, which will minimize the odds that you burn yourself. Coffee creamer comes in a variety of flavors, so if you don\u2019t like regular coffee creamer, you may have simply not found your preferred flavor. There are also non-dairy creamers that you can use if you\u2019re lactose intolerant."

However, most coffee makers heat the coffee to 160\u2013180 \u00b0F (71\u201382 \u00b0C). When you pour yourself a cup of coffee at home, let it sit out on the counter for 3-5 minutes to let the temperature drop on its own.Warning: Even at 136 \u00b0F (58 \u00b0C), the coffee is still very hot. If you spill coffee at this temperature, it may cause a burn after 10-15 seconds of skin contact. It should be fine to start slowly sipping it, though. If you really want to get scientific with it, buy a glass thermometer and put it in your coffee after letting it cool. This will let you know if you if you\u2019ve reached the optimal temperature for a perfect cup of coffee."

Blowing on the surface of the coffee is actually quite effective at cooling it, but it only reduces the temperature at the surface. While the coffee is still steaming, blow on it for 8-10 seconds before taking a drink. Blow on the surface for a few seconds after each additional sip. If your coffee is scalding hot, blowing on it isn\u2019t going to dramatically cut the temperature down on its own.
