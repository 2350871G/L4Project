Some of these settings are critical to gameplay and some of these are quality of life improvements and are optional. The critical settings that need to be changed to on are:\n\nTurbo Building and Builder Pro: Build Immediately, both of which will greatly improve your ability to build well. The quality of life improvements are: Tap to Search/Interact, Controller Autorun, Auto Pick Up Weapons, and Auto Sort Consumables to Right, all of which should be switched to on."

Only use a custom Wireless Controller Configuration if you are highly confident in a specific custom layout and have practiced it as custom layouts can be very difficult to use. After changing this setting, spend some time learning the controls making sure to look at both combat and build controls."

A good starting point for most early players is 4-5 for look sensitivity, 4-5 for aim sensitivity, and 1.5X-2.0X for both the build mode and edit mode sensitivity multiplier. If these speeds are too fast, change them to 3 for look and aim sensitivity and 1-1.25X for build mode and edit mode sensitivity multipliers. Over time, increase these settings gradually until you are at your fastest comfortable speed to improve your play."

The end of the game can be anywhere on the map due to the storm so an intricate knowledge of all locations will be very helpful.

Build ramps and walls to gain instant high ground on an enemy. Build a 1x1 box with ramps upward to give yourself a tower to fight from, 1x1 towers are quite useful for defense, attaining high ground, and conserving resources.
