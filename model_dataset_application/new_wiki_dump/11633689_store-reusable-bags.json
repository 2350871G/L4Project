          "description":"To efficiently declutter your reusable bags, set your bags out on a table. You can sort them by material, purpose, or size. Count how many of each type that you have and consider giving away or donating any excess bags. When you create an organizational system, group similar bags together to make it easier to find what you need. Throw out any bags that are ripped, worn down, or missing handles. If you have dozens of bags, give some away. You probably only need 5-10 bags. There is no right or wrong way to sort bags. Think about how you use your bags and choose a method that works best for you. For example, if you rely on differently-sized bags for different things, sort them by size. If you use certain bags for groceries and others for carrying clothes, sort them by purpose. You can also sort bags by the material that they\u2019re made out of to keep things easy."

          "description":"Lay your reusable bag on a clean table. Orient the bag so that the broad side is facing up. If the thinner sides of the bag automatically fold in, allow them to naturally bend inwards. If you have a softer bag, gently tuck the middle of each side into the center of the bag. Spread any wrinkles away with the palm of your hand to smooth the material out.Tip: If you have one of those stiff plastic bags that stands up on its own and folds easily, simply follow the natural creases of the bag to fold it up. Typically, the sides of these bags fold in towards the center and the base of the bag wraps up into the middle. Fold the top over the base to fold it naturally. Alternatively, you can roll the reusable bags up and tie a rubber band around them if you want to store them side by side in a vertical container. If your reusable bag has straps, stuff them into the center of the bag. You can fold plastic shopping bags the same way as reusable bags to declutter your home and store all of your bags in the same place."

Fold the opening of the bag towards the center and align the sides of the bag so that they\u2019re flush. Adjust the fold as needed until the top third is laying on top the center third.

Fold the bottom of the bag on top of the center of the bag. Push down on each crease to secure the bag. If you fold the bottom up first, the opening at the mouth of the bag can spread out while you store the bag."

Skip this step if you are planning on storing your bags vertically. This step is optional. If you want to store your bags flat on top of one another, it is probably easier to not fold them in the middle."
