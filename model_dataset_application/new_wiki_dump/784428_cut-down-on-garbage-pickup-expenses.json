      "description":"If your garbage collector offers them as an option, buy and use their plastic garbage bags for your garbage pickup instead of buying weekly pickup with a garbage bin. In using bags, you will only place one at the curb if you have need to do so that week. If you do not have a full bag of garbage for a particular week, you will wait until you have a full bag before placing it out for pickup. You may be able to go several weeks before you have need to place a bag out for pickup, because of steps 1 and 2, doing so on an as-needed basis. In this way, you can avoid having to pay for weekly garbage pickup, if you do not have the garbage volume to justify it."
