The \u201cstructure\u201d can be a house, apartment, barn, office, stable, or vessel (e.g. ship). Accordingly, if you give someone permission to enter the building, then that person has not committed burglary. Burglary often happens at night, but it doesn\u2019t need to. It is illegal to enter a building unlawfully during the daytime as well. Even if you gave someone permission to enter a building, you should still report any crime that they commit.

Seeing someone violate your privacy can be very upsetting. Surveillance video can be helpful for addressing weaknesses in your home security. After the shock of the burglary has passed, you should take some time to go through your house and address weaknesses in security. For example, you may have seen that a burglar accessed your bedroom window by climbing onto a low-hanging tree branch.
