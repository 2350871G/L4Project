Drizzle a little bit of olive oil in the pan and use a pastry brush or piece of paper towel to spread the oil around the pan. This will keep the baked tortellini from sticking to the dish. You could also use a casserole dish of a similar size if you don't have an 8x8-inch  (20x20 cm) pan."

You'll also need to add 1/3 cup (75 g) of mascarpone cheese, 1/4 cup (5 g) of chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves, and 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh thyme leaves. Use a whisk to combine the sauce. If you don't have fresh parsley and thyme, you can substitute dried herbs. Just use 1/8 of a cup (3 g) of dried parsley and 1 teaspoon of dried thyme."

Cook the tortellini according to the manufacturer's instructions. This should take around 2 minutes. Carefully drain the cooked tortellini.

Stir the frozen tortellini directly with the sauce and put it in the baking dish. Bake the frozen tortellini as directed, but add an extra 10 minutes to the cooking time. If you want to make the tortellini ahead of time and wait to bake it, just assemble it and refrigerate it until you're ready to bake.

For example, use part-skim ricotta cheese instead of the mascarpone cheese. You can also substitute low-fat mozzarella cheese for the smoked mozzarella cheese. To add a rich flavor, consider crumbling in a little fresh goat cheese. Since it's so flavorful, you'll only need to use a little bit."

Stir together 1/4 cup (25 g) of fine dry breadcrumbs and 2 tablespoons of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle this topping over the tortellini before you bake it. You can also use panko breadcrumbs if you want more of a crunch. Panko breadcrumbs are larger so they stay crispy as they cook."
