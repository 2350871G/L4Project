Larger flowers will be heavier and flop around more, while smaller flowers will stay in place easier. Make sure you aren't obstructing your text with overly large flowers. The easiest flower to draw will have four to five petals and you can easily draw one by placing a small circular item on your paper (a penny is a good starting point). Next, simply trace a bubbled outline around the circle to make your flower."
