Mud cake is one of the best types of cake for this project, because it\u2019s less delicate than a sponge cake, and will hold its shape better. To make the volcano cake, you'll also need:\nOven preheated to 350 F (177 C)\nSmall saucepan and a medium glass bowl\nLarge mixing bowl\nWhisk\nElectric beaters\nRubber spatula or spoon\nThree wire cooling racks\nRound cookie cutter, about three inches in diameter\nKnife\nFrosting knife\nPlastic shot glass\nTongs\nDry ice and water"

Finally, add the eggs, beating them in one at a time. Whisking in the ingredients separately like this will help ensure a smooth and moist cake, because it will help incorporate air into the batter."

Beat everything with electric beaters for three to four minutes, until the frosting is light, creamy, and smooth. If the frosting is too dense and thick, add another tablespoon of milk and beat for another minute. Add the fourth tablespoon if necessary\nWhen ready, the frosting will be light and easily spreadable."

This will remove the center of the cake. The hole in the center of the cake will be used as a reservoir for the lava, and it will also hold the shot glass containing the dry ice.
