If you\u2019re eating chicken with bones in it, use the knife to hold the chicken in place while you pull the meat off with the fork. Americans usually hold their knife in their right hand and fork in the left while cutting food. To eat it, they move the fork to their right hand. European diners usually hold their fork in their right hand and the knife in their left."

Standard chicken seasoning includes 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 1 crushed garlic clove, a tablespoon of salt, and a tablespoon of pepper. For an aromatic roasted chicken, create a seasoning by combining tablespoons of celery flakes, salt, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.
