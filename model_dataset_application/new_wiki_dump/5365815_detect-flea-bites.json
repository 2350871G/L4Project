They sometimes also bite in areas such as around the waistband (in the gap between the shirt and pants) or around the tops of your socks. Due to the way fleas feed, their bites tend to occur in small clusters."

You may be able to see a single puncture mark in the middle of the bite. Flea bites can sometimes bleed or scab over if you scratch them a lot."

If possible, try to avoid scratching the bites too much. Excessive scratching can cause the bites to become infected, and will also make the itching worse. Try relieving the itch with a topical cream, such as calamine lotion or an antihistamine cream."

Try running a comb through your animal\u2019s fur to see if you can find flea dirt (feces) and live fleas. Try combing your pet over a white surface, such as a piece of cloth or paper, so that any falling dirt or fleas are more obvious. To prevent the fleas from escaping and moving around your home, you can also comb your pet over a sink or tub with a little soapy water in it. This way, any fleas that you comb out of your pet\u2019s fur will die when they land in the water. Since flea dirt is primarily composed of blood, it will turn red or reddish brown if you mix it with water. Focus on the parts of your animal where fleas are most likely to be active. For example, fleas most commonly gather on the ears, neck, lower back, and base of the tail on dogs. On cats, fleas may concentrate on the back of the neck and top of the head."
