      "headline":"Get ready.",
      "description":"If you want this party or event to be special, it's probably good to know where everything you need is ahead of time. Have your outfit laid out, make up at hand, and whatever you'll be taking to the party nearby. If you're hoping for a really fun, special night it's good to shower and have about 1 to 2 hours before the party to get ready."

    {
      "headline":"After you've showered, the first thing to get set is hair.",
      "description":"You can do this step however you'd like, but first give your hair a quick blow dry. After this style it however you want, or go with your natural hair. If you do style it, put on a quick spray of hairspray so your style look holds. Not too much so that your hair becomes stiff or clumpy, but just to keep it generally in place and how you'd like it. If you have curly hair (it depends on the texture) it can also sometimes help to air dry it, leaving you with soft natural looking curls."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Wear the appropriate makeup.",
      "description":"It all depends on the type of party or event, but start off with some neutrals. Maybe some eye shadow that complements your eyes or outfit, a hint of eye liner, a bit of mascara, a nice pink or nude lip gloss and a little blush. This again all depends on your personality and the type of party your going to, but that's a safe start for any occasion. Makeup is not necessary at all, but if your want a special night a little lip gloss and mascara could never go wrong."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Bring some confidence.",
      "description":"The last and maybe most important step in your hot party look is wearing your personality. Be YOU, which sounds cheesy but is really a good move. Be comfortable with yourself in your look and get ready to get a little flirt on for fun. Make sure to have fun and make this a party to remember."
