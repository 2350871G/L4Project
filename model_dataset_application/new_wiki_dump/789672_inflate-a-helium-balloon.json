Since there are various balloon sizes and helium tank sizes, you may want to consult an online chart to figure out the tank size you want. For example, a standard-sized balloon, eleven inches in size, requires .50 cu. ft. of helium. A 50 cu. ft. helium tank can therefore fill 100 eleven-inch balloons, because .50 (amount of cu. ft. required per balloon) x 100 (amount of balloons desired) = 50 (size of tank in cu. ft.)."

But if this is a one-time thing, rent one instead. Party stores typically offer helium tanks you can rent for up to three days. You may be able to negotiate a longer time frame, or you could simply go to one of the stores which offer longer-term rentals. Purchasing a tank with between eight and fourteen cubic feet of helium in it costs around $40 to $60. Renting a helium tank ranges from about $25 for 14 cubic feet of helium up to a little over $200 for 291 cubic feet of helium (enough to fill about 525 eleven-inch balloons). Return the item to the store by the time agreed upon when you rented it, so that you don\u2019t get charged an extra fee.

Press down carefully until all of the air has left the balloon. Fold the balloon without creasing it, and store it. Arranging the Balloons Choose a ribbon color and style. A good length for balloon ribbons is 48 to 57 inches (120 to 140 cm) per balloon. You can match the ribbon color to the balloon color, or opt for a neutral like ivory or white. Formal occasions like weddings and anniversaries generally use the latter. Curl ribbon with scissors, if desired. Pinch the scissor blade against the dull side of the ribbon with one hand. With the other hand, pull the length of the ribbon tautly across the scissor blade in one long stroke. Repeat if the ribbon doesn\u2019t curl on the first attempt.
