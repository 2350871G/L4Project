Rugs provide a useful foundation that roots floating decor with a base of delightful color and texture. The right pairing will let the eye transition seamlessly from the floor upwards. Choosing bright hues and eye-catching designs can help you refocus attention to the important parts of the room. Putting a rug under a lone chair, such as a rocker in a nursery, will dress up the area. A seating area, such as one comprised of a sofa, table, and chairs, will look more cohesive and connected if everything is anchored with a rug. Double up extra large rugs to go under an entire seating area."

They can add safety to a slippery floor as well as collect mud and dust that may otherwise be tracked throughout your home. Opt for rugs with dark colors and short, neat fibers. These are generally easier to clean and won\u2019t show stains as readily. Spare hardwood and tile from from being marked up by sliding chairs or barstools."

While selecting the rugs themselves, go with designs that are complementary in shade and pattern yet still visually distinct. The result will be an elegant contrast that adds extra depth without throwing the room out of balance. Contrast can come from color, texture, size or pattern, meaning you have an abundance of styles to choose from when personalizing your quarters. For example, place a faux-hide rug on top of a flat, woven rug. Add a small rug in another area of the room if you use a main rug to anchor a room. For instance, if you have a large rug in front of your sofa, you could add a small rug near the fireplace hearth in the corner. Experiment using rugs with mismatched shapes, like a fuzzy fur thrown over a flat area rug, or a circular rug extending from the corner of a square one."
