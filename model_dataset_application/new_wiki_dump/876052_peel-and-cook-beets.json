Roasted beets make a great addition to salads, and they're wonderful when they are plain as well. Scrub the beets; make sure to remove all the dirt. Trim the green tops from the beets with a sharp knife. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius). Rub the beets in olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the beets in a roasting pan lined with aluminum foil. Cover the beets with another sheet of foil. Place the pan in the oven and roast for at least an hour. Test to see if the beets are done by poking them with a fork. If you feel resistance, keep roasting the beets. If the flesh is soft, they are done. Remove the beets from the oven and allow them to cool. When the beets have cooled, peel off their outer skins. Use them in a recipe or serve plain."
