These can be made of plastic, cardboard, metal, or fabric. marked units for measuring length along its edge. These can be for either English (inches) or metric (millimeters or centimeters) units of measurement. In the U.S. and the UK, a student's rule is from 12 to 36 inches (30.48 to 91.44 cm), or from one to three feet long. Some typical fractions of inches used to make measurements more accurate are halves and quarters. Some typical fractions of centimeters are thin marks for every tenth of a centimeter (every one millimeter), and thick marks for every half centimeter (every five millimeters)."

Find an object or distance between two points you want to measure. This can be a length of wood, string, or cloth, or a line on a sheet of paper. Rulers and yardsticks are better to use on hard flat surfaces. If you are measuring a person for clothing it is best to use a flexible tool like a seamstress' tape. Long distances can be measured using a measuring tape. Place the zero end of your rule at the end of your object. This will usually be on the left side.
