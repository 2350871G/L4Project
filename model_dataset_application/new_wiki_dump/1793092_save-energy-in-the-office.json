Look for office equipment with energy saving features, usually bearing the \u201cEnergy Star\u201d logo. This certifies that the equipment is made to reduce energy usage. Energy Star certification can be found on computers, printers, copiers, refrigerators, televisions, windows, thermostats, and ceiling fans, as well as other appliances and equipment."

          "description":"It\u2019s important that everyone also power down electronics when they are not in use. Contrary to popular belief, shutting off your computer at the end of the day will not shorten its lifespan and can save a lot of energy. It can also help to use a power strip for each group of electronics in the office. You can then use the strip\u2019s on/off button to turn off the power to all the appliances at once when they are not in use. Remind everyone in the office to unplug \"vampire electronics\" once they are fully charged, like your cellphone or your laptop computer. Once your cellphone is fully charged, unplug the charger from the electrical outlet, as it will still draw in energy if it is left plugged in. You can also encourage everyone in the office to make sure their computers have the power down option set as well as the hibernation option set. Screen savers do not save energy. In fact, they are considered energy wasters. Your computer must provide twice as much energy to light up your computer screen when the screensaver option is turned on as it normally does when your computer is running.

          "description":"To conserve electricity, create an office policy to ensure all the lights in your office are turned off, including lights in bathrooms, kitchen areas, and meeting rooms. You should also tell your employees to switch off lights in a room if they are going to be out of there for longer than a few minutes at a time. During the day, maximize natural daylight by using natural light instead of overhead or fluorescent lights. Turning off one fluorescent light for an hour a day can save 30 kg of carbon dioxide emissions per year. Consider areas in the office where there is excessive lighting or lights that are turned on in rooms that are barely used. Remove these lights or suggest not using lights if daylight is enough. As well, switch the light bulbs to energy-saving bulbs, such as compact fluorescent (CFL) or LED bulbs, to save more energy."

You should also clean and repair your office's heating, venting, and air conditioning (HVAC) system on a routine basis, or hire a repairman to come at least once a month. A clean and working HVAC system will help reduce your energy bills and make it easier for your office\u2019s HVAC system to cool or heat your office.

In the winter, set the thermostat at 68 degrees or less during the day and at 55 degrees at night when no one is in the office. In the summer, setting the thermostat at 78 degrees or more will also help to reduce energy use in the office. During the winter, keep shades and blinds open in the office during a sunny day. This will heat the room naturally. Close the blinds at night to reduce the amount of heat lost via the windows. In the summer, keep shades and blinds closed to avoid overheating the room. As well, after office hours and during weekends, energy can be saved by increasing the temperature of the thermostat during hot weather, and by lowering the temperature in cold weather."
