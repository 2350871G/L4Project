Sprinkle in the baking soda slowly so the solution doesn't fizz too violently, then top it off with a cup (240 mL) of cold water. Combine the ingredients in a clean spray bottle so you can easily apply the solution to the stain. Hot water can cook the proteins in dog saliva and make it set, so use cold water instead."

However, stay on the safe side and check your tags for care instructions before attempting stain removal. You should also test the solution on an inconspicuous spot before treating the stain. Furniture tags typically include letter codes. W stands for water-safe, S means solvent cleaners only (no water), WS means either will do, and X means vacuum only or have the piece professionally cleaned. If your furniture tag has an S, use alcohol or a store-bought solvent cleaner. If you can't find a letter code, don't use water just to stay on the safe side."

For hard surfaces, there's no need to let the solution sit. If you don't have a spray bottle, dab the stain with an absorbent white cloth soaked in the solution.
