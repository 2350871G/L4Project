Over time, the grease from the spray that doesn\u2019t get burned off during the cooking process will build up and create a sticky layer.

Instead, cook your food over low or medium heat. Cooking using high heat can also burn or dry out your food, so simmering at a lower temperature for a longer period is recommended."
