      "headline":"Walk silently.",
      "description":"When you step down on a wooden floor, keep close to the walls. This is generally the best supported part of the wall and therefore the least creaky. Nonetheless, make sure to test the floor at each step to make sure it won't creak loudly."

      "headline":"When walking on stone or tile, step by putting your foot down heel first, then rolling to the toes.",
      "description":"Although less noisy than wooden floors, any surface can be hazardous to the careless. Another method is to walk on the outside of your foot. This may take a little practice but is a proven method."

      "headline":"When opening a door, turn the doorknob all the way (extremely slowly) before pulling the door open.",

    {
      "headline":"Understand the door carefully.",
      "description":"By opening a door slowly, you can be more sneaky because since the movement is slow, someone's eyes may not be able to pick it up very well. The only downside to this is if the door is squeaky. You must be VERY careful in this situation. If you hear the slightest squeak, close the door IMMEDIATELY, but DON'T slam it, and try not to make noise when it closes. At this point, you must open the door at a faster rate than before, but don't just rush it open. Another way squeaks may be reduced is by lifting up on the knob, as this takes pressure off of the hinges."
