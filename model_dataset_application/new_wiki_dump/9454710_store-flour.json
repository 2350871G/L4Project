Nut and alternative flours spoil even faster than whole grain flours because they contain a lot of oil. If you want to keep them fresh longer, store these flours in the freezer, so that the oil in the flour will not oxidize as quickly when exposed to air. If you store these types of flour in the refrigerator, you will extend their shelf life to six months, whereas storing them in the freezer extends freshness to 12 months. Transfer the flour to an airtight container before freezing it."
