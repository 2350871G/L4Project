You may need to provide proof of the age and brand of the mattress. Most resale stores will not purchase a mattress that is too old, in poor condition, or not considered a high-quality brand. While selling your mattress to a used furniture store is a convenient option, you will probably not get the best price for your mattress this way. Resale stores buy items at a low price and sell them at a markup in order to make a profit."

It is in the consignment shop\u2019s best interest to get you the best possible price for your item, so you are likely to get a much better deal this way than you would selling your mattress to a resale shop outright. Consignment is probably only an option if your mattress is of very high quality and in extremely good or \u201clike new\u201d condition. Call ahead to find out if the store you are interested in will take mattresses, and ask what their requirements are for age and condition."

Use a website that specializes in selling used items, such as OfferUp, Craigslist, eBay, or the Facebook Marketplace. If you use one of these options, you will need to write a strong description of your mattress and provide good photographs. Some online sale venues may charge a listing fee or take a small percentage of the profit from your sale. Check the terms of use for each site and decide which option works best for you."

People looking to buy a used mattress are hoping to get a good deal, so they will not be willing to shell out retail prices. However, determining the original retail value can provide a good starting point for figuring out the market value of your mattress. If your mattress is in new or nearly new condition, try selling it for roughly 70-80% of the original retail price.
