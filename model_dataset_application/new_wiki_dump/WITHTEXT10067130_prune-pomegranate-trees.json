          "description":"Choose the strongest, healthiest-looking shoot, then use a pair of pruning shears to remove the rest. The remaining shoot will eventually grow into a 10 to 12 in (25 to 30 cm) tall trunk with about 5 to 6 branches coming off of it. You will eventually cut it shorter. This system is not recommended for areas that are prone to freezes. If your single sucker dies, then you have to start over. Choose the multi-trunk system instead.
