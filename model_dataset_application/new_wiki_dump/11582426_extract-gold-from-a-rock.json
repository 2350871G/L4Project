Wear thick work gloves to protect your hands from blisters and cuts, and use ear plugs to protect your hearing. Cover your eyes with safety glasses in case a piece of rock flies up into your face.

Place 1 or more rocks inside the container in a single layer. Don\u2019t try to crush too many rocks at one time. If you layer the rocks, it'll be too difficult to crush them.Did You Know? You can extract gold from quartz rock that contains veins of gold. However, you\u2019ll need to crush the quartz to access the gold."

          "description":"Lift the sledgehammer into the air, then swing it down onto the rock as hard as you can. Strike the rocks with your hammer until they\u2019re crushed into small pebbles. If you have access to a power hammer, use it to break up your rock faster and easier. You can also drop a heavy object, like a weight, onto the rocks. However, this might be less efficient. Historically, gold prospectors used sledgehammers to break up rock.Variation: The best way to crush the rocks is to use a crushing machine, which will produce a fine powder with little effort on your part. Consider purchasing a rock crusher designed for extracting gold if you\u2019re serious about prospecting."

Use a metal rod with the metal container to create a makeshift mortar and pestle that are strong enough to use with rocks. Press the end of the metal rod into the rock pebbles, then drag the rod along the bottom and sides of the metal container. Grind the rocks until the pieces are slightly larger than the holes in the bottom of your mining pan. Historic gold miners used a mortar and pestle to grind up rocks. With persistence, you can turn the rocks into powder."
