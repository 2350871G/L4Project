You can make soft waves, thick curls, or straighten your hair for this look. You can also braid your hair in 2 pigtails at the back of your head if you\u2019d like to.

          "description":"Pick your knitted headband up and put it over your head, making sure it touches your forehead and the very bottom of your skull. Position the headband so that it won\u2019t slip off as you wear it throughout the day by keeping it over your ears and on top of your forehead. Keep all of your hair hanging loose underneath the headband. Most knitted headbands are pretty thick, so they shouldn\u2019t slip off. However, a lot of movement throughout the day can sometimes knock them loose."

          "description":"A knitted headband is heavy and it can pull your hair flat against your head. Give yourself some volume by using your fingers to very gently pull some of the hair on top of your head up towards the ceiling. Try not to pull whole strands out and create flyaways. If you accidentally pull too much hair out, take off your headband and put it back on again. This will reset your hair."

Bring a compact mirror with you to check on your hair as you wear your headband.Tip: If your hair does bunch up, just take your headband off and put it back on again. This will smooth out any flyaways. You can also spray the top of your hair with a thin layer of hairspray to prevent flyaways."

This should create a seamless look that hides the back of the headband underneath your hair.Tip: If you did not pull enough hair back with your clip, it may bump out awkwardly over your headband.
