Tongits doesn\u2019t use jokers, so set them aside for the duration of the game. You\u2019ll also need a flat surface to place cards on, so sit around a table or in a circle on the floor."

The dealer of the first hand is chosen at random, and then the winner of the next game becomes the new dealer. Each time someone new wins the game, that person becomes the dealer. If 2 or more players roll the same number, have them roll again.Tip: The benefit of being the dealer is that you get to go first, which means that you\u2019ll get 1 more card than the other 2 players. This can work in your favor if you get a good card or it might land you with more points if someone calls \u201cTongits\u201d or \u201cDraw\u201d early in the game."

After you draw a card, look at your hand to see if you have 3 or 4 cards of the same number or a straight flush, which is 3 or more cards of the same suit in sequence. If you do, lay them down. Keep in mind that you can play more than 1 meld in a turn. For example, if you have 3 Kings, you could put all 3 down at once for a meld. If you have a 6, 7, and 8 of spades, you could put these down at once for a meld."

          "description":"Once you or another player has put down a meld, you can add cards to that meld on your turn, but only if you have cards that fit with it. This means that if you put down 3 of the same number cards, and you get the fourth on another turn, you could put it down. Or, if one of your opponents puts down a sequence of cards in the same suit and you have the next 2 in the sequence, you could put those cards down on your opponent's meld during your turn. For example, if a player puts down 3 Aces and you have an Ace in your hand, you can play it on that player\u2019s meld. Or, if one of your opponents puts down a 4, 5, and 6 of hearts and you have the 3 and 7 of hearts, you could put these down on that player\u2019s meld."

The dealer will place the first card on the discard pile on their first turn. Since the goal of Tongits is to be the player with the lowest score at the end of the game, you may want to discard your highest point value cards. However, you might want to hang onto them if you expect to be able to meld them or lay them off on an upcoming turn. For example, if you have a King in your hand, this will count for 10 points at the end of the game if you cannot get rid of it, so it might be wise to discard it. On the other hand, if you have 2 Kings, you might want to keep them in the hopes of getting a third and making a meld at some point in the game. Tip: Keep in mind that other players may draw the cards you discard, so be careful not to discard anything that you could incorporate into another player\u2019s meld."
