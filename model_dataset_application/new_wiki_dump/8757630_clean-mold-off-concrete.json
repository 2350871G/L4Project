If you don\u2019t want to use a pressure washer, try a regular water hose. You can rent a pressure washer at a home or building supply store. You may need a van, pickup truck or SUV to transport it, and a friend to help load and unload it. Ask the rental agent how to use the washer and to give you any safety precautions. Find out if the washer comes with nozzles. Don\u2019t use settings finer than fifteen degrees. Never use a zero degree nozzle on a pressure washer."
