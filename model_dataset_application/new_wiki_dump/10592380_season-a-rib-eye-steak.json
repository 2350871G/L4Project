          "description":"Most steak enthusiasts agree that it\u2019s best not to dress up a rib eye too much\u2014all it really needs is a little salt and pepper. That way, more of the meat\u2019s natural flavor will come through rather than being lost under a layer of intense spices. For best results, use a coarse variety of salt, such as kosher or sea salt, and fresh-ground black or colored peppercorns. Alternatively, you can sprinkle on some salt as a pre-seasoning, then add pepper to taste once your steaks come off the pan or grill to fine-tune their flavor."

          "headline":"Make your own version of classic Montreal steak seasoning.",
          "description":"Combine 1 teaspoon of kosher or sea salt, 1 tablespoon of fresh-ground black pepper, 1 tablespoon of fine orange zest, 2 teaspoons of onion powder, 2 minced cloves of garlic, and 1 teaspoon of dill seeds in a small bowl. Stir the ingredients together until they\u2019re thoroughly mixed, then keep them on standby until it\u2019s time to season your steak. This recipe will produce enough seasoning to lightly coat 1-2 average-sized rib eyes. If you want to make enough seasoning to have some left over, set your oven to its lowest possible setting and dry your fresh ingredients inside on a baking sheet for 2-3 hours, then combine them with the salt, pepper, and onion powder in an airtight jar. When properly stored, your seasoning should last up to a year or possible longer.Tip: Consider buying whole spices and grinding them yourself using a spice grinder, coffee grinder, or food processor. You\u2019ll definitely notice a difference!"

          "headline":"Coat your rib eyes with a homemade dry rub for a bolder flavor.",
          "description":"Grind 3 tablespoons of salt and 1 tablespoon of black pepper, then stir in 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and 1-1.5 teaspoons each of cayenne pepper and chili powder. You could also include any number of other sweet and savory spices, such as garlic or onion powder, smoked paprika, turmeric, or cumin. Adjust the amount of each spice to suit your personal preferences. For a unique twist on a traditional rub, throw 1-2 tablespoons of freshly-ground coffee beans into the mix. The coffee will add bold earthy notes to the sweet and savory seasonings. Store your homemade rub in an airtight container in the pantry or refrigerator to keep it from becoming exposed to moisture and forming clumps. There, it should last for 6 months to a year."

          "description":"Bringing your steaks to room temperature will help them cook more evenly. While they\u2019re warming up, you can go ahead and add your seasonings to make sure they have plenty of time to infuse into the meat. Most steaks only need about 20-30 minutes to reach room temperature, but thicker cuts like rib eyes may require 45 minutes to a full hour. Be sure to time the rest of your meal accordingly. Frozen steaks should always be thawed in the refrigerator overnight. Never use the microwave, as heating raw meat can put it in a temperature zone conducive to bacterial growth."

Once you\u2019ve coated one side of the steak, flip it over and do the same to the opposite side. There should be a visible layer of seasoning on the meat when you\u2019re done. Coating your rib eyes this way will help the seasonings stick, allowing them to be better absorbed and making them less likely to rub off on your cooking surface."

Wait until they\u2019re just slightly cool to the touch, then fire up your skillet or grill. Be careful not to let your steaks sit for too long, as this could give bacteria a chance to begin setting up on the meat. They shouldn\u2019t be left out longer than about 90 minutes tops, no matter how thick they are."

The balance of oil, citrus, and salt is perfect for seasoning thick cuts like rib eyes. If you prefer, you can use lime juice in place of lemon juice. All that matters is that you select a type of juice with a high acid content to better tenderize the meat. Any of your own favorite oils can make an acceptable substitute for olive oil. The oil is there to provide better coverage and help balance out the tartness of the citrus."

          "description":"Dump in your brown sugar, garlic, cracked black pepper, and salt. Stir the mixture together thoroughly until the dry spices are thoroughly incorporated. Feel free to include any other herbs or spices you wish to use. Red pepper flakes, fresh chopped parsley or basil, or a dash of Italian seasoning could all complement a juicy rib eye well."

Most packaged marinades are made using the same basic oil-acid-salt formula that homemade recipes call for, so they're guaranteed to taste (almost) just as good. Look for marinades that are made specifically to be used with beef steaks."

Stretch a sheet of plastic cling wrap over the opening of the bowl to seal it up, then make room for it on one of the central shelves in your refrigerator. Make sure you've made enough marinade to cover your steaks entirely. If needed, you can add a little more of each ingredient to bring the volume up. Another option is to put your rib eyes in a large plastic zipper bag and pour the marinade in on top of them. Plastic bags are less likely to get knocked over and make a mess in your refrigerator.Tip: The key to getting the most flavor out of your marinade is to use it while it's fresh. Try not let your marinade sit for more than 1-2 hours before you add your steaks."

          "description":"The longer you leave them, the better they'll taste. As your rib eyes marinate, they\u2019ll absorb not only the flavors of the marinade, but also the acids, which will help tenderize them from the inside out. Don't forget to dispose of your used marinade down the drain once your rib eyes are ready to come out of the refrigerator. Never use the same marinade twice, as it could contain harmful bacteria. Purists often argue against marinating steaks, but it can be an extremely simple and convenient way to season meat if you don\u2019t have time to mess with homemade spice blends and rubs."

          "description":"If you\u2019re using a skillet, turn on the cooktop to high heat, then add just enough oil to coat the pan and let it reach a steady sizzle. If you\u2019re going the grill route, position the steaks directly over the burners or briquettes where the most intense heat can easily get to them. Sear your rib eyes for about 5 minutes on each side, or until they begin to form a dark, crispy crust. Afterwards, lower the heat or move them to a cooler part of the grill to continue cooking to the desired doneness. The key to a perfect finish is making sure your cooking surface is nice and hot before you add your rib eyes. Using high heat will cause your seasonings to cook right into the outside of the meat, resulting in a more flavorful steak.Tip: If you tend to rely on a meat thermometer to tell you when your steaks are done, look for it to read 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C), which is right around medium."

Not only will resting them for a brief period allow them to cool to a safe temperature for eating, it will also give the juices in the meat a chance to settle. If you cut into your steaks too soon, all those delicious juices (including the seasonings that have been absorbed) will end up on your plate rather than in your mouth."

Re-refrigerate the butter until it hardens and spread a dollop onto your steaks as they rest. The melted butter will lend your rib eyes an extra burst of mouth-watering flavor, giving you a true steakhouse experience. You can also make compound butters using outside-the-box herbs like cilantro, basil, tarragon, and even horseradish! Store your leftover herbed butter in the refrigerator, where it should keep for about 2 weeks, or in the freezer, where it will last for several months."
