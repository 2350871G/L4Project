Why this temperature? Alcohol and water have different evaporation points. Alcohol begins to evaporate at 172\u00b0 F, whereas water doesn't begin to evaporate until 212\u00b0 F. So if you can heat the wash up to at least 172\u00b0 F but no more than 212\u00b0 F, the evaporated liquid in the still will be alcohol and not water."
