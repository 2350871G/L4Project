Make your cut 2 nodes below the damaged part, or at least 2 in (5.1 cm) below the gall mite infection. Use clean gloves and shears to remove the infected area. A node is where the branches and leaves grow out of a stem."

Use a shovel to dig the entire plant out of the soil or remove the plant from its pot. Dispose of any flowers or leaves that fell off of it as well. Fuchsias are inexpensive and relatively easy to replace. If the majority of your plant is swollen and a different color, it\u2019s best to replace the whole thing."

Seal the bag tightly and throw it away in the trash to be sure it doesn\u2019t infest anything else. Avoid composting the pruned sections because the gall mites can still spread this way."

Place the pruned sections in a fire-safe container and set the plant aflame, watching it carefully until the flame is out to be sure it doesn\u2019t cause any damage. You can also burn whole fuchsia plants that have been severely infected by gall mites, if necessary."

Apply the spray during the plant\u2019s dormant season before the buds sprout to give it the best protection. Follow the instructions on the insecticidal soap spray to be sure it works its best. These sprays cover any gall mites on the plant and make it so that they can\u2019t breathe. Using an insecticidal soap right after you prune your plant is another good way to stop gall mites."

Instead of just covering the flowers and stems with your insecticidal spray, apply it up under the leaves and around all of the stems, even if they\u2019re tiny or hidden away.

Do 3 applications of the spray, waiting a week or so in between each application to let the insecticidal spray do its job. Applying the spray during the summer helps keep the gall mites under control if there is an infestation. Saturate the plant and soil with the spray each time you apply it."

Once you get a brand new fuchsia plant, avoid putting it next to your others for at least 2 weeks so that it\u2019s less likely to become infected by gall mites.

If you have a hardy fuchsia plant that can withstand chillier temperatures, keep it outside during the winter for 2-3 days so the weather can help fight off any unwanted infections. For example, temperatures between 16 \u00b0F (\u22129 \u00b0C) and 24 \u00b0F (\u22124 \u00b0C) can help kill off gall mites. Bring your fuchsias back into warmer temperatures after a few days if possible.
