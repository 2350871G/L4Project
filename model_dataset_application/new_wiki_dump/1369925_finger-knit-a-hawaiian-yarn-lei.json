Tuck it under your index finger, over the middle finger, under your ring finger, and over your pinky finger. Weave it back around in the opposite manner. Tuck it under your pinky, over your ring, under your middle, and over your index finger. Wrap it around your entire hand across your palm. Leave it to hang. Use your dominant hand to do the knitting. Take a finger and place it under the newly palm wrapped string. Pinch the yarn string wrapped around your index finger and lift it over the palm string. Pull it up enough for it to go over your entire finger. Repeat for the three other fingers. Repeat the last two steps about 10 times. A small ball will eventually form on your knuckles. Tug on the small yarn (that you started in the first step) and on the lei itself to evenly distribute out the knitted yarn. Continue knitting until you get the desired length you want.  Cut drawn yarn (from the ball) about 3 to 6 inches (7 to 15 cm) from your hand.  Wrap the newly cut yarn on the back of your hand. Weave it, bottom up, through each finger. Slide the yarn off from your fingers and pull on the finger weaved yarn.  Tie the ends together and present the lei to a loved one. ",
