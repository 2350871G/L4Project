Be careful to avoid scraping it onto the carpet or any other surfaces it could get stuck to. Stop scraping once all the large chunks of putty have come up. Wipe your knife off several times as your scrape the putty, and try folding the fabric so the putty is on an edge to make it easier to remove without potentially spreading it to other areas of the fabric. You could also use your fingernails to remove excess putty, but some people find it unpleasant to get it stuck under their nails. Using a blunt knife keeps your hands clean."

The stain will start to disintegrate, and you will notice it gets slimy again. Don\u2019t use antiseptic ethyl rubbing alcohol as it won\u2019t work very well."

          "description":"Use gentle motions when scrubbing, as you want to apply some force but you also don\u2019t want to tear or damage the fabric you\u2019re cleaning. The scrubbing motion will loosen the Silly Putty from the fibers of the clothing. Try holding the fabric you are cleaning so that the rubbing alcohol and scrubbing only affects one layer rather than soaking through to the entire piece of clothing. You can even just put one hand on the underside of the stained section and use your other hand to do the cleaning. A scrub brush or toothbrush works particularly well for this task as the bristles provide more friction than a washcloth will, but if the fabric is particularly delicate, use a soft washcloth."

If so, there is still Silly Putty in the material. Keep working until the material doesn\u2019t feel slimy anymore. Rinse your scrub brush, toothbrush or washcloth out several times as you clean. This will show you if putty is still being raised out of the clothing."

Once it has dried, check the stained area to see if it is still visible. If it is, repeat the rubbing alcohol and scrubbing process again. Putting the fabric into the dryer, even on a low-heat setting, would make any remaining stain set in to the fabric.

The freezing temperature will harden the putty and make it shrink up into itself a little bit, hopefully making it easier to crack and peel off. You can also try putting an ice cube or a bag filled with ice directly on the stained area instead of freezing it overnight.

You may be able to just peel off the frozen putty without having to crack it first, depending on how small or large the stain is.

If you find that the putty isn\u2019t freezing even after being in the freezer for 12 hours, you should try another method to remove the stain. Depending on kind the kind of Silly Putty being used (name brand versus imitation or made-at-home putties), it may not freeze entirely due to the composition."
