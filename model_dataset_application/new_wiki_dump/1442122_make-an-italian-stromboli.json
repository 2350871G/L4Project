  "text":" Steps Prepare the dough for the Stromboli.  Place a package of active dry yeast into the bowl of the electric stand mixer.  Add 1 1/3 cups (316 ml) of warm water to the bowl to dissolve the yeast.  Put 1/4 cup (57 ml) of vegetable oil, 1/2 teaspoon (2 g) salt and 2 cups (454 g) of flour to the bowl.  Attach the paddle to the electric mixer and beat the ingredients in the bowl until they are a smooth consistency.  Add additional flour to the bowl until the mixture forms a dough that is soft.  Remove the paddle attachment and replace it with the hook. Use the hook to knead the dough for about 10 minutes, until it becomes elastic. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, and turn it to coat both sides. Cover the dough with a dish towel and let it rise in a warm area for 45 minutes. Making Dough by Hand Place 1 1/3 cups (316 ml) of warm water and a package of active dry yeast into a large mixing bowl, and stir the mixture to dissolve.  Add 1/4 cup (57 ml) of vegetable oil, 1/2 teaspoon (2 g) salt and 2 cups (454 g) of flour to the bowl.  Mix the ingredients by hand until they are fully incorporated and have formed a smooth dough.  Place the dough onto a floured surface and proceed to knead the dough for 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary to prevent sticking.  Mold the dough into a ball and place it in a bowl greased with oil and cover with a kitchen towel for 1 hour until it has doubled in size.  Preparing the Stromboli Puncture the dough with your hand once it has risen, and place it on a flat surface dusted with flour.  Cut the dough into 2 equal parts, and roll the first part into a rectangle that is 15 by 12 inches (38 by 30.5 cm).  Lay the slices of ham lengthwise across half of the rectangle.  Put the pepperoni on top of the slices of ham.  Season the meats with some of the dried basil and oregano.  Place provolone on top of the meat, and then sprinkle the mozzarella cheese on top of the provolone.  Season with more dried basil and oregano.  Fold the other half of the dough on top of the meats and cheeses and seal the ends so that the filling is completely encased.  Use a pastry brush to brush the top of the dough with olive oil and then season with the remaining dried oregano.  Place the Stromboli on an oven sheet and place in a preheated 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 C) oven for 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove the Stromboli from the oven when it is browned evenly and allow it to cool, and then cut it into slices. ",
