Drop 1 of the baits into the tunnel and then fill in the hole you dug. Place 3 or 4 baits throughout the tunnel or near exposed molehills. Toxic mole baits can be purchased at most gardening stores or online. If you notice new mounds appearing in your garden, place more baits near them. Many times, baits will not be enough and you will need to pair them with traps."

          "description":"Spear or harpoon traps are spring-loaded and impale the mole as it passes through its tunnel. Use your thumbs to depress the center of an active tunnel by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Push the trap into the soil so just the tips of the spikes are in the ground. When the mole passes through the tunnel, the trap will set and stab into the mole. Use caution when setting the trap since it has sharp, spring-loaded edges. If you have pets or children that play outdoors, select a different trap since spear traps have sharp exposed edges."

Cover the tunnel with dirt so no sunlight gets through. Check the trap twice daily to see if you\u2019ve caught any moles.

Blood meal fertilizer has a high nitrogen content and helps plants grow while also deterring moles from the area.
