      "headline":"Make Organic Aphid Sprays.",
      "description":"Create an aphid spray using a mild detergent  and water, or make a soapy garden spray. You could also try the more garlic and onion version here. Spray every two to three days over a period of a week - you must spray the aphids directly for this to be effective. You can also use garlic spray as an effective aphid controller. Consider using neem oil mixed with water. Or, add neem oil with OHN (garlic + ginger + molasses). Dilute the ingredients in water and spray directly below the leaves (where aphids hide). Spray repeatedly 3 times per week for a plant with serious aphid damage."

      "headline":"Squash them.",
      "description":"Provided you don't mind quite a bit of patrolling and squishing, you can be very effective at reducing the aphid population by manually squashing them. This is labour intensive and likely you will miss some, but combined with organic sprays, this can be very effective. Wash your hands well with soap after each session, or wear garden gloves."

      "headline":"Plant companion plants.",
      "description":"Plant your favourite roses or other aphid-attracting plants alongside aphid-discouraging plants. Aphids dislike garlic, chives, onions, mint, petunias. Aphids love nasturtiums - use them to attract the aphids away from your other plants. Roses grown with garlic plants or chives are much less prone to aphid attacks and both have beautiful flowers of their own during their flowering season."
