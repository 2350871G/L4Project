          "description":"Grocery stores have long been a prime source of single-use bags, but plastic bags are everywhere. The best way to avoid them is to carry fabric wherever you go. Many stores sell reusable bags, but you can save money by making your own out of fabric. Even if you buy a reusable plastic bag, it is much better than relying on disposable ones. These big bags are stronger and work well on any shopping trip. If you drive to the store, keep bags in your car so you don't have to rely on the ones stores will give you."

Many coffee places sell reusable cups and even give discounts to customers who bring in their own cups. If you often drink coffee on your commute, try getting a metal tumbler. Another option is to stay at the coffee shop and ask the barista to pour your brew into one of their mugs instead of a paper cup.

Then, wash the straw out with soap and water when you get home. These straws are safe to use and more resistant to bending than flimsy plastic ones. Metal straws are durable but tend to get as hot or cold as the drink you\u2019re sipping. Glass straws are temperature-resistant but more fragile. You could also get a silicone or bamboo straw. Silicone is temperature-resistant like glass. Bamboo is the eco-friendly option since it\u2019s a biodegradable plant. Even if you decide you don\u2019t need a straw, there is a way to avoid plastic. Sip your drink straight from the cup!"

Glass is more fragile but also good at keeping hot water warm. You could even get a reusable plastic bottle, which is still a better option than buying multiple single-use bottles. If you\u2019re worried about the quality of drinking water available, purchase your own filter. Some reusable water bottles come with built-in filters."

You could roll up metal cutlery in a bag, then take it home and wash it when you\u2019re done eating. Metal cutlery is fine, but carrying it around can be a bit of a hassle. If you\u2019re looking for something lightweight, try getting a set of bamboo cutlery. Bamboo is also organic and biodegradable in case you need to throw it out. Keep a set of utensils where you need them, such as at the office. If you\u2019re ordering out, wait until you get the food home so you can take advantage of your own cutlery."

Retailers now sell reusable versions of those containers, but you could also take advantage of any resealable food storage container you have. Use these containers whenever you need to carry around a meal. To cut out even more plastic waste, carry a container with you whenever you go to a restaurant. If you do get a plastic leftover container from a restaurant, put it to good use instead of throwing it away. These containers generally can be washed out and reused a few times."

Plastic tents, sponges, wipes, and bottles are a few examples of items to stay away from. Instead of using a disposable razor, get a straight razor or at least one with a replaceable head. If you have a child, swap out disposable diapers for cloth ones. Making these changes often saves you money as well as cuts down on waste. For instance, you don\u2019t need to buy plastic sandwich bags or containers when you\u2019re reusing jars. Factor in the plastic packaging a lot of disposable items come in. Even if you buy wipes that aren\u2019t made of plastic, they come in a plastic container. Use old rags or sponges instead for cleaning."

Because of their small size, they don\u2019t get filtered out at water treatment plants. Many animals also see microbeads as food and eat them. Look for plain products with exfoliants like salt or oatmeal to avoid ones with microbeads. Check the packaging before buying a product. Microbeads will be listed as an ingredient there.

Companies generally fit more of a product in bigger packages while using less plastic. One big package is better than several smaller ones. One way to take advantage of bulk food purchases is through canning. Store food inside a sterile container filled with syrup or brine. Canning is a way to preserve food for storage.

Reuse plastic toys in particular so they don\u2019t end up sitting in a landfill. The opposite applies if you have things to get rid of. Instead of throwing away toys, for instance, donate them.
