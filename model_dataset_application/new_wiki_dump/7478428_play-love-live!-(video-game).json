To do this, you can win love gems in an event, from the daily hand outs, from leveling up, or from maxing your bond with any idolized student. If you receive scouting tickets, it means you can honor scout for free. If you get a scouting coupon, you can either scout for supporting members or save 5 and get a super rare or ultra rare. You should save them for the super rare or ultra rare."
