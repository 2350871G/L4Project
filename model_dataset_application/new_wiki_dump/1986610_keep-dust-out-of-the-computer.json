Raising the computer just six inches off the floor will decrease dust intake by up to 80%. Place your tower on the desk or raise it off the ground in some way. Many computer desks will have a tower shelf that is raised up off the ground to help promote airflow. You can use just about anything to raise your computer tower, as long as it's stable."

Your computer fans may be causing some of your dust problems. You may be able to reconfigure them so that they actually help prevent dust build-up. Follow the steps in the previous section to open your computer case. You may need a Phillips screwdriver to detach the fan enclosures from the case. Find the fans that are currently installed.

You can purchase dust filters that fit into the screw holes of your computer fans. These should be placed on all of your intake fans to catch the majority of the dust that they bring in. Make sure to get the right size filters for your fans, and to clean them regularly. Close up your case. After your fans are set up properly, you can close your case up and plug it back in. You should be able to go much longer without having to clean the inside of your computer when your fans are working with you.",
