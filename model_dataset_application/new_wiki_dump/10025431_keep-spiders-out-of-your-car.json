If possible, avoid turning your car on before you need it, particularly if your car is prone to spider infestations. Spiders move towards, not away from, idling cars because they expect to find a \"ground zero\" in the car where the vibrations can't hurt them. It's comparable to seeking shelter in the eye of a hurricane. The larger your car is, the more likely that it will attract spiders while idling."
