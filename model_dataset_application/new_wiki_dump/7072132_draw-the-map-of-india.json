When figuring out how large or small to draw each state, use the eraser on your pencil or the tip of your finger as a measuring tool. For example, you might measure and find out that the length of India is 27 pencil erasers, and the first state that goes along this length is 3 pencil erasers long. If desired, label each state after you\u2019ve drawn them all in, writing each state\u2019s name.

  "text":" Forming the Outline Use a ruler to draw a vertical line going down your paper. Start with a blank piece of paper, a ruler, and a pencil. Draw a vertical line slightly to the left of the center of the page about 14.5 cm (5.7 in) long. For your line to be off-center slightly, begin drawing it roughly two-fifths of the way across the top of the page. Draw the line lightly so that you can erase it later on. Make a dot on your line at the 4.5 cm (1.8 in) mark. Draw a light dot or tick mark 4.5 cm (1.8 in) from the top of the line.

Use your pencil and ruler to draw a straight horizontal line that extends 4 cm (1.6 in) to the left of the mark and 8 cm (3.1 in) to the right of the mark. Your lines will form a rough cross shape. Orient the ruler diagonally going from the top left to the bottom right. Locate the center point on your drawing where both lines converge and place your ruler along this dot. Twist your ruler so that it\u2019s running diagonally across the page. Draw a line that\u2019s 8 cm (3.1 in) long.
