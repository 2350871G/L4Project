          "description":"If you\u2019re new to meal prepping, it can feel overwhelming to make every meal for the week ahead of time. Instead, focus on the meals that you think it would benefit you the most to prep ahead. For example, if you find yourself rushing out the door every morning, you might focus on prepping some healthy breakfasts. When you\u2019re first getting started, you may not even want to prep a meal for every day of the week. For instance, you might just prepare dinners for the next 3 nights or make lunches for days when you know things will be extra busy at work."

          "headline":"Choose recipes for each meal you want to prep.",
          "description":"Before you start prepping, it\u2019s important to have a clear plan of action. Decide exactly what you want to make for each meal so that you can figure out what to shop for.Keep in mind: You can always cook part of your meal in advance and then add components that don\u2019t keep as well right before you serve or eat the meal. For example, you can fry up a sunny-side-up egg and toss it on top of a pre-made bowl of grits in no time! When picking recipes for prepping, look for foods that keep and reheat well, can be made in big batches, and can be mixed and matched with different sides or main dishes. Dishes like chilies, stir fries, and casseroles are great for meal prep."

          "description":"Before you go out shopping, check your fridge, freezer, and pantry to figure out what you need and what you already have. Write an inventory of what you have and make note of anything that needs to be replenished. Make sure you always have basic staples available, such as eggs, bread, milk, rice, cooking oils, and your favorite seasonings."

          "headline":"Write a shopping list for your weekly meals.",
          "description":"Sit down with your inventory and your recipes for the week and write a list of anything you need. Double check the list and the ingredients for each meal before you head to the store. Make note of the quantities of major ingredients in each recipe so you don\u2019t come up short once you start cooking. For example, if a chili recipe calls for 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of ground beef, note that down so that you can get enough."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Go shopping before your chosen prep day.",
          "description":"Meal prep is a time-consuming task, so don\u2019t plan to shop and prep on the same day. Try to get all your shopping done the day before so that you\u2019ll have plenty of time to cook without the pressure of having to buy all the things you need. For example, if you typically meal prep on Sunday, plan to do your shopping on Saturday."

Choose a day and time that works for you and block it out on your schedule as meal prep time. For example, you might choose Sunday or Wednesday as your prep day. Depending on how much cooking you plan to do, you may need anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to do your prep."

Prioritize your list from the most time consuming and complicated tasks to the quickest and simplest.Tip: Make sure you have plenty of cooking dishes and utensils washed ahead of time. That way, you can have several things cooking at once and you don\u2019t have to waste time washing dishes in between cooking different meal components. For example, it generally takes longer to prepare a chicken for baking than to chop vegetables for a stir fry, so plan to get the chicken going first. Don\u2019t forget to include preparatory steps, like laying out your ingredients, gathering pots and pans, and setting up your cooking area."

          "description":"Unless you\u2019re preparing individual, ready-to-eat meals, you can make and store many of the components of your meals separately. Cook up large quantities of sides that you can split up between meals, or make a big batch of a main dish that you can mix and match with different sides throughout the week. For example, you might cook up a big batch of rice pilaf or quinoa that you can have with several meals, or make a bunch of muffins so you can incorporate them into your breakfasts throughout the week."

Set them aside so you can put them in their own containers until you\u2019re ready to use them. Keeping sauces and dressings separate from other ingredients helps prevent your foods from getting soggy in storage."

          "headline":"Multitask while your meals are cooking.",
          "description":"You can make the most of your prep time by preparing multiple items at once. Start cooking items that take a long time to cook but don\u2019t require a lot of supervision, and use that cooking time to prepare or cook other items while you\u2019re waiting. For example, you could throw some stew ingredients in the slow cooker and then chop veggies for a salad while you\u2019re waiting. To ensure that nothing gets burned or forgotten, use an app that allows you to set multiple timers while you cook."

Glass casserole dishes, BPA-proof plastic containers, and even mason jars are great options for storing your food. You can save even more time and kitchen space by using containers that are also safe for your stove, microwave, or oven. That way, you can simply warm up the food in the storage container when you\u2019re ready to eat it! Get containers of various sizes to suit your different needs.

To help you keep track of which foods you plan to eat on which days, you can even label the containers with a \u201cuse by\u201d date (e.g., \u201cTuesday, 3/3\u201d)."

Put foods you plan to use at the end of the week or even later in your freezer inside a freezer-safe storage container. Put dates on them so you know when you put them in storage and/or when you plan to use them. Ideal foods for freezing include things like sauces, soups, chili or other bean dishes, meatballs, casseroles, and smoothies.
