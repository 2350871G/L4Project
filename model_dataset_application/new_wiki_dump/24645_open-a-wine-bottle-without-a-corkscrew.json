A cheap white ballpoint pen or basic marker (including a highlighter or dry erase marker), in each case with the cap on, will work well. You could also use a long rod, a cylindrical container of chapstick, or a slim knife sharpener. Carabiners work well, too."

You can also place the object against a wall or other vertical surface and press horizontally. Push on the bottle's wide base to force the cork in easily. Hold the neck area and the other end of your object to prevent slipping. Make sure the surface is strong enough so that it will not dimple, or protected, like a wall padded with some junk mail."

While gripping the bottle with one hand and your object with the other hand, push firmly on the cork until it falls into the bottle. Be ready for the wine to splash a bit when the cork hits it. This method works well but you will likely end up with small pieces of cork in your wine. The surrounding area (and the opener's clothes!) should be stain-resistant as a little wine may spill; don't try this with red wine and a nice outfit or over a carpet. Have some napkins handy; you may wish to wrap one around the neck as you push.

  "text":" Pushing the Cork into the Bottle Find an object with blunt ends. It should be narrower than the cork and something that will not stab, shatter, burst, chip, or break the cork or bottle.

Using the vinyl-coated hook as a handle, pull the cork out, away from your body. This way, you don't need pliers or another object to remove it. Using a Coat Hanger Straighten the hook of a wire hanger. Get a cheap wire coat hanger and bend the hook part out straight. Make a mini hook at the bottom of the hanger.

An alternate method with a coat hanger is to use the hanger in place of a corkscrew. After straightening the hook, simply insert it into the center of the cork. Twist the hanger while pulling on it gently. This will gradually remove the cork. Using Paperclips Get two paperclips and a pen. Partially straighten the paperclips, leaving the U-shapes intact. Pull the outer portion of the paperclip into a straight line without straightening the innermost U shape. Insert one of the paperclips in the side of the bottle. Work one of the small U's into the bottle between the glass and the cork until the U is below the cork and the straight portion remains out of the bottle.

Insert a suitable utensil, such as a spoon handle, pen barrel, or pencil, under the twisted wires. Slide your fingers under the utensil, with the wires between your middle and ring fingers, and slowly pull out the cork. Using a Hammer Find 3 short finishing nails and a hammer. Ideally, you will want the nails to reach just to the bottom of the cork. Gently hammer the nails into the cork. Hammer them straight down and form a line with the nails. Keep the nails close to each other. Don't hammer too hard or you could break the cork into pieces. Place the claw of the hammer around the nails. It should grip them tightly to allow for removal.

If at first the cork does not come out, hammer nails in again in a line perpendicular to the original line and try again. Using Scissors Get a pair of scissors. It is best to use smaller craft scissors or scissors for children (not safety scissors). Open the scissors all the way. Be sure not to touch the sharp side of the blades. Hold the handles of the scissors and open them fully. Insert the thinner blade into the middle of the cork. Carefully apply a slight amount of pressure and push the scissor blade halfway into the cork. Be careful not to push the cork into the bottle or break the cork. Twist the scissor handles while pulling up. Hold the bottle tightly with one hand while twisting the handles of the scissors.
