  "text":" Preparing for the Activity Find a spacious area you would like to work on. Keep in mind if you are doing this activity with kids, you will have to find a surface that is accessible to them. Also, make sure that you choose an area that is not humid, because it might affect the slime making process. Protect the area you chose with newspaper, plastic sheets, or any other material you prefer. This activity can get messy, so make sure to fully cover the area you chose with the protective sheets to avoid staining. Find a pair of gloves and protective face masks for anyone participating. The protective equipment serves as a precaution. It is not safe to inhale or have skin contact with the black iron oxide powder that you will be working with. Thus, it is important to take the necessary precautions. Making Borax Detergent Solution Prepare this solution before you start mixing the rest of the slime. This solution will serve as an activator when making the magnetic slime. Using the solution in your mixture will allow the slime to be less sticky when it is being worked with. It will also prevent residue from staying under fingernails. Pour 1 cup of warm water in one of the mixing bowls. It is completely fine if you use tap water or bottled water. Warm water is best, because the detergent will dissolve faster in the warm water. Add 1 tablespoon of borax into the mixing bowl with the warm water.  Mix the solution using a plastic spoon. Stir clockwise and counter-clockwise until you see that most or all of the detergent has dissolved into the water. Make sure to stir slowly, so that the solution does not spill. Pour the solution into a plastic squeeze bottle while holding the funnel. Make sure to do this step slowly, so you don't spill. If any borax powder was left in the funnel, feel free to add it into the plastic bottle using the spoon Then set this bottle aside for later use. Making Galaxy Slime Set two mixing bowls and two plastic spoons in your work area. Use medium or large mixing bowls; a smaller sized mixing bowl might not be ideal, because the mixture can overflow, or spill when you start stirring the mixtures. Pour 1/2 cup of any white glue brand into the unused mixing bowl. It is important to use kids' glue instead of a more advanced strong formula. If you would like to make more slime, feel free to use 1 cup of glue instead. Add 15-20 pumps of any type of lotion into the mixing bowl to make sure that the resulting slime will be soft and easy to work with. If this step is skipped, the slime will be hard, dense, and rubbery. If you want to add more lotion, you can. The softer the slime, the more fun you will have! Add as much colorful glitter you want to make the galaxy effect you are thinking of. Using blue, silver, purple, pink, and gold glitters will give the galaxy effect that we usually notice. However, use any colors or shapes of glitter as you would like. The glitter will be noticeable later on, but it will not be as sparkly after the black iron oxide. Make sure to set aside glitter to decorate the slime further. Stir the mixture with the other plastic spoon to fully distribute the glitter. It might not seem as sparkly after mixing it, but it will be noticeable after the slime is created. Fully distribute the glitter. Making the Galaxy Slime Magnetic Scoop 1/2 cup of the black iron oxide from the pouch or container it came in. Add it into the galaxy slime mixture created previously. You can add more or less of the iron oxide, depending whether you would like to make the slime more or less magnetic. Keep in mind that making the slime stronger can make it harder to retrieve the neodymium magnet from the slime. Use a plastic spoon to thoroughly mix the black iron oxide and the white glue mixture. Stir clockwise or counter-clockwise to make sure the black iron oxide is evenly distributed. Finish stirring when there isn't any more iron oxide powder visible. Add 10-15 pumps of any lotion to the mixture again, to make sure that the resulting slime is soft. If this step is skipped, the slime will be hard, dense, and rubbery. If you want to add more lotion, you can. Get the plastic squeeze bottle that contains the borax diluted solution. Add enough borax solution into the mixing bowl so that it completely covers the top of the slime. You want to make sure that all of the slime can be exposed to the solution, so all of the slime can be activated. Use a plastic spoon to stir the mixture slowly. Continue to add more borax solution into the mixture until the magnetic slime is no longer sticky when touched. The slime should be gathering together to create its blob-like characteristic. Remove the slime from the mixing bowl by scooping up the slime with your hands or the plastic spoon. If you were wearing gloves, it is safe to touch the slime now. Any liquid that remains in the mixing bowl can be disposed of in a sink. Place the slime on the protected surface. Mold and stretch the slime on the surface for 3 minutes like if it were dough. If you added enough of the borax solution previously, then the slime should not be as sticky. Change the protective sheets under the magnetic galaxy slime or move your slime to another area of the protected table to remove any moisture. Decorating and Playing with the Slime Make your own galaxy! Allow your creative sides to show when you start decorating your magnetic slime. Add as many different colors and types of glitters as you'd like. Feel free to add small beads or other decorations of your desire. Use a strong neodymium magnet to hover over the magnetic slime. Watch how the slime moves to get closer to the hovering magnet. Continue to play with the slime. If you want to see a bigger effect, then slowly drop the magnet on the magnetic slime and watch it absorb the magnet. Keep in mind that if you used 1/2 cup of black iron oxide powder then the slime will not be as strong.",
