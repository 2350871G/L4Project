          "description":"Always begin by cracking open the eggs into a large bowl or other container. Raw egg, just like any material that contains significant amounts of water, will expand when frozen. If the eggs are frozen in the shell, this expansion could crack open the egg. Besides mixing shell fragments into the edible part of the egg, this could introduce harmful bacteria from the outside of the shell. If the eggs are near or past their expiration date, crack each one into a \"test bowl\" before transferring to the larger container. Discard eggs with obvious discoloration or a strong, unpleasant smell, then wash the test bowl before cracking the next egg."

There are two main ways to prevent this, depending on your intended use for the eggs. If you are using them alone or in savory dishes, stir in 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) of salt for each cup (240 mL) of raw egg. If you are using them in sweet dishes, instead stir in 1 \u2013 1.5 tbsp (15 \u2013 22 mL) of sugar, honey, or corn syrup."
