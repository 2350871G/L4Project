Remove the hinges from doors and cabinets before painting. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws attaching the hinges, and then take the doors or cabinets down. Remove handles, knockers, mail boxes, and other attached accessories from doors, cabinets, furniture, and other items. For walls, take everything off the walls and remove vents, switch plate covers, outlet covers, and other items."

Tape the drop sheet in place with painter\u2019s tape. Protect adjacent areas by taping them with painter\u2019s tape. This includes ceilings, walls, sinks, fixtures, and other areas touching the surface you'll be painting. For mobile objects like furniture, cabinetry, hardware, and doors, move the object to a well-ventilated space, such as a garage. Place the item on a drop sheet to protect the floor underneath."

          "description":"It\u2019s a good idea to use a degreasing cleaner to clean any surface before painting. This will remove all traces of oil, grease, grime, and dirt, and give the paint a clean surface to stick to. Dip a scrubbing pad or sponge into a degreasing cleaner and wipe the entire surface. Rinse the area with a damp sponge, pat it dry with a rag, and let the surface dry for 30 minutes. Denatured alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, and ammonia-based household cleaners are all good degreasing cleaners. You can also use \u00bd cup (4 ounces) of trisodium phosphate mixed with 2 quarts (1.8 L) of water as a powerful degreasing cleanser."

          "description":"Sanding before painting is important no matter what kind of surface you're working with, because it cleans and roughs up the surface so the paint can stick. Using an orbital sander will make the job go much faster, but you can sand smaller surfaces by hand with a sanding sponge. For countertops and wood furniture, use 150-grit sandpaper\nFor doors and metal, use 220-grit sandpaper\nFor walls, use 120-grit sandpaper\nFor cabinets, use 100-grit sandpaper"

Then, go over the entire surface with a clean, damp sponge to remove any remaining dust and dirt. Soak and wring out the sponge often to make sure you aren't just pushing dust around. Once clean, let the surface dry for another 30 minutes."

          "description":"Priming any surface before painting will give the paint an even surface to stick to, will cover imperfections, and will help reduce color variations in the final paint job. Choose a primer color that will complement your paint project, and use a primer suitable for the surface you're working with. Apply the primer with a roller, and use a brush to get into corners and awkward spaces and joints. Allow the primer to dry according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. This usually takes at least 24 hours."

Thinning out the paint prevents the paint from drying too quickly, and makes it easier to press in the pattern. If you're using a latex paint, mix it in the paint tray with equal parts glaze and water. For oil paint, mix the paint with one part paint thinner."

When the paint is dry, use the roller to apply a second coat of paint, working in small sections like before. Make sure the coat is very thin, because you don\u2019t want to completely cover the wood grain pattern you created.
