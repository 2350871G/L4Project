You can get these with their roots balled, bare, or in a container. Seeds and cuttings, while able to grow when planted the same way as young plants, take a few years to sprout."

Young yews are most vulnerable to intense sunlight, so keep them near taller yew hedges or walls. Other hedges and walls also shield the yew from strong winds."

Soil that feels soggy can give the yew root rot. Soil can be amended with sand or gravel for better drainage. Yew also grows well in containers. Get a good, slightly acidic soil from a gardening center and a container with drainage holes."

Don\u2019t worry about providing too much space. Yew grows high and wide. In heavy soil, gather the soil into a ridge six inches (15 cm) high and three feet (1 m) wide before planting.

If your yew has bare roots, spread the roots apart so that they don\u2019t grow into one another. Roots that are balled or in dirt from a container can be left alone.

Walk about six and a half to ten feet (2-3 m) from the yew. Use the string as a guide to plant the yews in a straight line. The yews will fill in the space between them as they grow, forming a solid hedge line."

If it rained during the week, test the soil first. When the soil feels damp about an inch (2 cm) down, you don\u2019t need to water the plant. Stop watering near the beginning of winter.

          "description":"The yew will grow thick, requiring trimming to control it and keep yew hedges even. Put on safety goggles and sturdy gloves. You can use shears or trimmers. Work slowly, cutting off the branches that stick out. Keep the plant tapered by cutting the top end slightly shorter than the bottom end. This will enable light to reach lower branches. It\u2019s best to let the hedge grow about four inches (10 cm) higher than you want it and then trim it. Do not attempt to cut the top off until the plant has grown. Trimming can be done in any season other than winter. A neglected yew can be renovated by trimming it very short in the middle of spring. The yew will need a few years to grow back to the desired size."

          "description":"In addition to waterlogged soil or sunlight exposure, browning is caused by road salt getting into the soil. In spring, the side of the yew closest to the road will turn brown. Do not prune these areas. Leach the soil by soaking it with water. Do add walls if possible to shield the yew from salt splashes. Make sure the yew is planted away from run-off areas. If there is a lot of rain after an exposure, you won\u2019t need to flush out the salt. If your yew is in a pot, add water until it drains from the holes in the bottom of the pot."

These are insects that can be scraped off with a knife. Also, shield the yew with walls or wire to keep out hungry deer and pet waste. In warmer climates such as the American South and Southwest, root knot nematodes may be the problem. Remove the yew if possible. Treat the soil with a fumigant or heat it for six weeks by covering it with plastic. If you see yellow mushrooms near the yew, the plant may die very quickly from Armillaria root rot. Dig up the soil so the yew\u2019s base is exposed. Replace the soil right before winter. To minimize your risk of a honey fungus attack, trim off broken pieces of root before planting the yew. Add compost to the soil regularly."
