          "description":"Like any alga species, black algae (which are really blue-green algae that look black) will grow quickly in warm water on a sunny day. Black algae are chlorine-resistant, because they have a protective outer layer that makes regular sanitization ineffective. While algae aren\u2019t harmful, their presence can be a sign that other bacteria are present. Other alga species that are common in pools are green algae, mustard or yellow algae, and pink algae, which is actually a bacterium. Algae tend to bloom in pools that have poor circulation, poor filtration, a high pH level, and a low chlorine level."
