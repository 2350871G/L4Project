The prep work will take 20 minutes and the cook time is 25 minutes. It will yield 2 1/2 to 3 cups (1,134 to 1,361 grams) of sauce. Each serving of sauce is about \u00bd cup (118 milliliters).

To \u201cscore\u201d means to cut a small \u201cX\u201d into the stem end of the tomato with a sharp knife. This will make their skins very easy to pull off after blanching them. Your \u201cX\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, just slice the basic shape into the tomato\u2019s end. Blanching is when you place vegetables into boiling water for a few minutes and then run very cold water over them. Be sure to use the ripest tomatoes for best results."

When you see the skins beginning to fall off, use tongs to carefully pull the tomatoes out. Place a strainer or colander in your sink and begin to transfer the blanched tomatoes into it. You will probably have to blanch the tomatoes in batches. Run very cold water over the ones in the colander while you finish blanching the rest. Along with making the skins easy to remove, blanching will also preserve the texture and color of the tomatoes."

You can easily add additional veggies to your sauce; mushrooms are very popular. Simply add them in right after you saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic. Meatballs are another favorite addition to this sauce. Beef, pork, chicken and turkey are all great candidates for meatballs. Start by making your favorite version and then brown the meatballs. Put together the sauce and allow it to simmer for about 20 minutes. Add the browned meatballs to the sauce and simmer for an additional 30 minutes. For vegans, try substituting the cheese with nutritional yeast. Simply sprinkle a small amount on top of the noodles and sauce right before you serve the pasta. The yeast will add a cheesy richness to the dish. This tomato sauce would also work well on homemade pizzas or as a tasty dipping sauce for bread sticks."
