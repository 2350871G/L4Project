This will let you know how much wiggle room you have if you find a table that you love, but is outside of your preferred dimensions. Having measurements beforehand will also help you avoid the frustration of having to return an item. To play around with sizing and shapes, place painter\u2019s tape in various configurations and decide which ones you like best. When you're measuring, make sure there's at least 18 inches (46 cm) between the edge of any couches or chairs and the coffee table so there's room for your legs when you're sitting down."
