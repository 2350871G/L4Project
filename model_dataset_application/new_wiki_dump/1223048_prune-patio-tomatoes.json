This will allow you to keep track of your progress and you'll be able to clearly see what needs to be removed as you work. Carefully work your way up the plant, pruning any non-essential growth away from it. Most of the pruning will take place at the bottom of the plant. Newly formed stems will need to be removed. These stems take nutrients away from your tomato fruits. Many stems on the lower portion of the plant will not yield fruit."

          "description":"Most tomato pruning can be done by pinching off whatever part of the plant needs to be removed. Hold the part of the plant between your thumb and index finger before gently snapping the piece away. You may need to move the piece back and forth until it loosens enough to break off. Most sections of the plant should be easily pinched off. Pruning shears are not needed unless a piece is too big to break away by hand. Using pruning shears can open the plant up to possible infection. If you must cut something from your plant, it's best to use a razor blade."

Removing too many leaves can expose the fruit to the sun and ruin the tomatoes. If you are in doubt about pruning something, it's best to leave it on. It can be a good idea to leave at least one stem on each time you prune. These stems can eventually produce extra tomatoes. You'll want around 4 or 5 stems on your plant that are producing fruit. If tomatoes would be exposed to the sun, it's best to leave stems and leaves on that area to provide shade. Don't remove more than 1/3 of the total plant while pruning."

When pruning your tomato plant, focus on removing these extra parts to help increase the amount of tomatoes produced:\nMost lower branches can be cut away from the plant. Cut away any new stems that are starting to grow from old ones. Any stems that don't have either flower or fruit can be removed. Snap off any dead or discolored leaves."

This will prevent the plant from growing upwards, redirecting growth outwards to the tomatoes themselves. Cutting off the top of the plant will prevent all upwards growth. It's a good idea to only do this late in the growing season, before the first frost. Without the top stem in place, your tomato plant will focus growth into the fruit instead of the stems or leaves."

Think about how many tomato plants you want to grow on your patio and select the right size containers for them. Keep in mind that tomato plants can get quite large, too. The exact amount of room required may vary between types of tomato plants. Always check the recommended space requirements for your tomato plant when considering a container. As a rule, though, each tomato plant will need a pot of at least 14 inches (35.6 cm) in diameter. Most single plant containers will accommodate one tomato plant. Smaller planters will generally result in smaller tomato plants. You can plant multiple tomato plants in one container. However, you will need to make sure each plant has enough room to grow.
