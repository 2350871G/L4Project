Geodes are specific geological formations that only result in particular regions. Within the United States, geode maps identify areas of the Midwest such as Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri as well as areas in the Southeast such as Kentucky, Tennessee, and South Carolina as common geode locations. Geode maps identify Brazil, Namibia Uruguay, Mexico as top areas around the world where geodes are located."
