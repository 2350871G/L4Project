Aim the torch along the bottom edge of the mixer with part of the flame going inside. For other heat sources, you can aim them directly into the mixer and let them heat the sand as it tumbles. Make sure to leave about 1 foot (0.30 m) or so of space between the 2 to allow room to vent. For instance, you can use an industrial propane heater for this purpose.

Let the mixer go until the sand is completely dry, which will depend on how much you have and how wet it is. This will likely go faster with a torch, as it heats the sand as it pours out. With a heater, it may take 30 minutes or more. You can turn the heater off after about 20 minutes to let it continue to steam the water off."
