These indoor grills are great if you live in a small apartment with minimal counter space, and they cook meals evenly at high temperatures. Use it like you would a typical cast-iron skillet, making sure to oil it prior to cooking.These types of grills do not always come with a lid. Use an inverted metal bowl as a makeshift cover to mimic the effect of a covered grill. To really get the effect of outdoor grilling on a cast-iron grill pan, preheat the pan on medium-high heat for at least 5 minutes, and use smoky seasonings such as smoked paprika or smoked salt."

          "description":"There are two types of hibachi grills. The first type is a grill that sits over a shallow charcoal pan. It is great for quickly grilling thin marinated meats. To use, sprinkle a small amount of charcoal in the pan, turn it on, and start cooking. The other, more common type of indoor hibachi grill has a large electric cooking surface great for stir fry dishes.Make sure to select a smokeless charcoal grill, as smoke from charcoal can be harmful when indoors."

          "description":"If you enjoy grilling sandwiches for you and your small family, consider an indoor electric grill and sandwich maker. They are typically small and compact and have a lid that enables you to cook both sides of your food. You don't have to stick to sandwiches with these grills, they are also great for cooking burgers, steak, vegetables, hot dogs, and much more. Another advantage is that they cook very fast, and most are slanted and come with a drip pan that collects the fat.Sandwich grills are usually compact. Large items like whole chicken or racks of ribs are too large and will take a long time to cook on these types of grills."

          "description":"If it's too cold to do your grilling outside, you can easily turn your fireplace into an indoor grilling area. Purchase a stainless camping griddle with a handle that will fit in your fireplace. This will allow you to grill your food directly on the flames, or wait for the fire to die down and then grill the food. This type of grilling allows you to have real firewood cooking, resulting in great flavors that you may be accustomed to with outside grilling.Always use safety precautions when using a fireplace grill, just like you would an outdoor grill. Never leave it unattended, keep a fire extinguisher or bucket of sand nearby, and avoid clothing that can dangle and catch fire."

Sandwich makers also do not take up a lot of space, so if you have a small counter or limited storage space, these grills are perfect for you.

Some indoor grills are large enough to accommodate an entire rack of ribs, as well as whole chickens and turkeys. If you're shopping for a range top grill, choose one that is long enough to cover 2 stovetop burners.

An automatic temperature control system will turn off when the food is finished cooking, preventing it from burning. With a manual dial pad, you're able to completely control the temperature to your liking. If you don't have a grill with a temperature control system, use one with a heat indicator light that comes on when the ideal temperature has been reached."

When purchasing an indoor grill, check the bottom of the box for the power level, and make sure it is at least 1,000 watts. Grills with higher wattage cook foods quickly, but are typically more expensive. Lower power levels (around 750 watts) take longer to cook but may be cheaper.Meats cooked on grills with lower wattage may taste steamed, instead of grilled on an outside barbecue. If you plan on cooking large and thick pieces of meat, select a grill at least 1500 watts. Grills that are 1200 watts and below are ideal for small amounts of cooking."

Similarly, these grills may also have grill plates that you can easily detach.
