  "text":" Baking the Cupcakes Preheat your oven to 180 \u00b0C (356 \u00b0F) and place the rack in center of the oven.  In a separate bowl whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon.  In another large bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, and oil until slightly thickened.  Fold the wet mixture into the dry mixture until incorporated.  With a rubber spatula, fold in the grated carrots, grated apple, chopped nuts, and raisins.  Place paper liners in 20 muffin cups.  Evenly divide the batter between the 20 muffin cups.  Bake about 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean.  Frosting and Serving Remove the muffin tins from the oven and let them cool for 5 minutes on your counter top.  After 5 minutes of initial cooling, take out all of the cupcakes and place them on cooking racks. If you let the cupcakes sit in the tins while they cool to room temperature, you'll find that the paper liners will become wet and stick to the cupcakes, making them difficult to unwrap when you're ready to eat them. In the bowl of your electric mixer, beat the butter and cream cheese until smooth.  Gradually beat in the powdered sugar until fully incorporated and smooth.  Beat in the vanilla extract.
