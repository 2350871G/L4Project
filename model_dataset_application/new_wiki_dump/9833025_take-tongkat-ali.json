Some preparations of tongkat ali have been found to contain dangerous amounts of mercury, while other supplements claiming to contain tongkat ali have been shown to actually be spiked with prescription erectile dysfunction drugs like Viagra and Levitra. If you already purchase supplements from a store or online shop, ask them if they carry tongkat ali.

Manufacturers of tongkat ali extract can use very different concentrations in their preparation of this supplement, ranging from 20:1 to 200:1. However, a ratio 100:1 is considered standard. If you do opt to take a stronger concentration, lower your dose accordingly. For instance, if you choose a 200:1 concentration, you would take half the dose recommended for 100:1 concentrations. If you take a lower dose, you can increase your dosage as well, but you may not get the full effect of the supplement."

If your extract doesn\u2019t taste bitter, it may not be made of true tongkat ali, or it may not be a sufficient strength to produce an effect. Quassinoids are among the bitterest compounds which are found in nature, so the bitter taste in your tongkat ali supplement should be immediately obvious."

Since there is little research supporting the optimal dose of tongkat ali, you should stick to a dosage which is considered safe yet effective. You can take 200-300mg of tongkat ali in one dose, or you can split it into 2 doses throughout the day if you prefer."

This is because fiber from foods can slow the absorption of the supplement into your body. You will probably want a glass of water to help you swallow the capsule, since it's bitter. Avoid taking herbal supplements with juice, as the acidity can affect the way the extract is absorbed into your body."

Tongkat ali plants usually bear fruit when they are 2-3 years old, and you should harvest the plant when it is no more than 4 years old.

To dry your tongkat ali in the sun, lay it flat in a warm, dry place that receives at least 5-6 hours of full sun a day.
