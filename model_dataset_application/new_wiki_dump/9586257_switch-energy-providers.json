Before you switch your energy provider, research local companies to find the best rates. Some companies will offer fixed rates over a period of time, while other companies will send you a variable rate based on how many kilowatts you use. If you use a lot of electricity, you may want to find a fixed rate plan. If your energy usage changes a lot month to month, you should get a variable rate plan. Some floating plans will change the rate per kilowatt depending on the market. This can cause your bill to fluctuate over time. Popular sites in the U.K. include Quotezone, The Energy Shop, Energylinx, Money Supermarket, Unravel It, and Energy Helpline."
