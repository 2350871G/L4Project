  "text":" Before You Start Set your teddy bear down for a friendly chat. Casually ask him what he wishes for as a gift and instruct him to create a list. If your teddy bear has trouble writing a list on his own, help him by listening to what he says and writing it down for him. Once you have your teddy bear's wish list, set him down for a nap so that you can make the gift without him peeking. If you feel insecure, leave the room so you can make your gift in privacy. Once you've made your presents, put them in boxes and wrap them in decorating paper. Put them somewhere where your teddy bear won't see or find it. Upon the special day on which your teddy bear will receive his gift, give him his presents. Watch him smile! Making the Gift Method One: Obtain several pieces of paper and a piece of cardboard. Make sure the cardboard is twice as big than the paper. Write your story on the pieces of paper. You can either come up with the story or copy a fairytale onto the paper (ex: The Princess and the Pea). Once your story has been written out, carefully staple the pieces of paper together so that they don't get messed up. Fold the cardboard in half so it's like a book cover.
