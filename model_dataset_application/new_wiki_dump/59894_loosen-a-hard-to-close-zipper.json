          "headline":"Pinch below the zipper.",
          "description":"This step is common, so you may have already tried it. If you haven't, try pinching the fabric below the zipper to squeeze the garment into its zipped position. Do this while gently coaxing the slider of the zipper upwards. This step can help if the issue is caused by the teeth trying to pull away from each other."

          "description":"Another common tactic that you can try is pinching above the zipper. This tactic helps gather teeth together when they're having a hard time catching, and it can help in cases where the zipper is having trouble because your tailored slim-fit trousers or flirty cocktail dress are a little too tight."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Look for anything in the way.",
          "description":"If the zipper is still sluggish, closely examine the zipper. Make sure there isn't anything like thread or hair stuck in it. If something is in the way, pull it out to see if that fixes the problem, as it can keep your zipper from closing easily. You may need to move the zipper back and forth as you try to pull the thread or hair out of the zipper."

          "headline":"Check the teeth.",
          "description":"One of the most common problem areas for a zipper is actually the teeth. Over time, the teeth can get bent out of alignment. Look to see if all of your zipper's teeth are straight and in line. If they're not, you can use pliers to pull them back into place. Just don't be too rough, as you can pull the teeth off."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Replace the zipper.",
          "description":"Another option is to just replace the zipper completely. You can do it yourself at home, or you can take it to a tailor's to be replaced. Most sewing stores sell zippers you can use to replace the one you have. However, having a professional do it will be easier, and it doesn't cost too much."

Applying vinegar can help take care of the problem by cleaning it out, allowing it to zip more readily. Soak a cotton ball with vinegar. With the garment flat, run the cotton ball up and down the zipper. Make sure not to get it on the fabric if you think it may bleed. Apply it to both sides of the zipper, as well as the inside of the teeth."

If it doesn't affect the color of the garment, scrub the detergent into the zipper, using a brush. Wash it out, and see if it helps your zipper be less sluggish."

Rub the soap on the teeth of the zipper with the zipper open. Once you've rubbed some in, zip it up and down to get it lubricated well. The soap will help the slider move up and down more easily on the zipper. Another easy option is petroleum jelly. You can also use a bit olive oil, but be careful, as it could stain your clothes."

Make sure to hit all of the zipper, trying to get into the teeth as much as possible, as well as the back of the zipper. Move the zipper up and down a few times to help get the graphite in place."

Just sprinkle a little on the zipper, and move it up and down to lubricate it. You may need to wash your clothes after using this method, if you're not careful where you sprinkle the powder."

          "headline":"Rub the zipper with wax.",
          "description":"You can use wax paper, paraffin wax, or even candle or crayon wax. Basically, the wax will lubricate the zipper, making it easier to pull up and down. You'll need to lubricate both sides for this step to work. For the wax paper, tear off a small sheet of wax paper. Make sure it's wax paper, not parchment paper. With the zipper open, rub it on both sides of the zipper. Test to the zipper to see if it helped. If it didn't try it again. For other types of wax, rub the wax onto the zipper with the zipper open. Wipe off any excess wax from the fabric. Blow over it with a really hot hair dryer, making the wax melt and allowing it to penetrate the teeth better. Once it cools, run the zipper back and forth to test it."
