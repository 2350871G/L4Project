      "description":"A basketball court has two mirror images on each side of a center area. Draw from the outside line and work towards the center. Make sure to connect each item (unless otherwise noted) to the left or right side of the drawn court. Draw a rectangle (connected to the sideline). Connect the rectangle at the short end of the rectangle to a half-circle. This should become the outer edge of the free-throw lane/area. Draw the symbol for the basket for the basketball. Leave a little empty space between the outer edge of the court and the free-throw line area. Connect a filled in circle to this line you drew. Make sure this basket is rather center between the top and bottom of the rectangle. Draw the three point line. Although college basketball has the 3-point line farther towards the free-throw half circle, the 3-point line can be generalized and be given more space on most professional basketball courts. Leave a little space at the top left/right corner and a little white space at the bottom left/right corner, but connect a semi-circle (free-hand) to the outer horizontal lines."
