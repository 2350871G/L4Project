You can use sandpaper to smooth out rough edges by gently rubbing it on the edge where you cut your popsicle stick. Any grit sandpaper will work. Using a Wire Cutter Find a pair of wire cutters with a flat blade bigger than 1 inch (2.5 cm).

Cutting with Snips Choose your snips based on how you want to cut. Snips are color coded based on the direction that they\u2019re designed to cut. Green snips make cuts to the right, red snips make cuts to the left, and yellow snips cut straight lines. Choose your snips based on whether you\u2019re trying to cut at an angle or make a straight cut. The advantage of using snips is that they\u2019re going to cut quickly.
