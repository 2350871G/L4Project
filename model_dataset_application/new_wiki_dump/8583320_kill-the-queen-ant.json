However, the easiest way to spot the queen ant is to look for the ant with wings. Queen ants in most species will have wings at some point in their life. Because they have wings, after they lose them you can see where the wings were attached. Queens have a larger thorax (the middle section of the body) than other ants."

Mix \u00be of microwave heated maple syrup or honey with \u00bc cup of borax. Stir until smooth and combined. This creates a liquid bait for the adult ants. To make a solid bait that will kill larva, use the same ratio of powdered sugar to borax, mixing until it is combined. Place large drops of the baits in the middle of a trail of ants, including any walls, railings, or sidewalks. Place the liquid and solid mixtures along the trail as you near the nest. If there are multiple trails, do it on each trail. Don\u2019t place borax in the garden or on soil. If you have ants in your garden, place the solution on something to protect the soil and your plants. You can buy borax at the supermarket or home improvement stores. Borax is toxic. Make sure to prevent pets and children from getting into this solution."

The ants will take the cornstarch into the colony to be used as food. The fiber content in the starch will make the ants swell and die, including the queen if she eats the cornstarch. This may take a while to work, but may be more effective and long-lasting."

It attracts ants, and the ants mistake it for food, so they carry it back to the nest. The poison in ant bait is carried back to the nest and ingested by ants. If an ant dies and other ants eat it, they will ingest the poison that killed the ant. The ants will spread the poisonous food to the colony, including the queen. This can take up to three weeks."
