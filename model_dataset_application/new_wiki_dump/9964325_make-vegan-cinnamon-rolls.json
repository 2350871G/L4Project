  "text":" Making the Dough Spread vegan butter over two foil pans. Rub about a tablespoon of butter on each pan, spreading it all over the surface and edges. Set aside. Combine the melted butter, almond milk, and sugar in a large bowl. Beat well with a whisk. The mixture should be slightly warm (100\u2013110 \u00b0F (38\u201343 \u00b0C)) and at room temperature.

Stir with a wooden spoon until the ingredients are fully incorporated together. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a towel. Set it aside in a warm area to rise for about an hour. Making the Cinnamon Rolls with the Filling Add the remaining flour to the bowl. Remove the plastic wrap or towel off the bowl. Combine in the remaining \u00bd cup (95 grams) of flour and mix well. Knead the dough on a floured surface. While kneading, add extra flour if the dough is still sticky. The dough should not stick to its surface and should be easy to knead. Roll the dough out into the shape of a rectangle. Using a rolling pin, spread the dough out so that it's about \u20442 inch (1 cm) thick. Adjust the corners so that it stays even. Spread the vegan butter all over the dough with a butter knife.  Sprinkle the cinnamon and brown sugar evenly on top.  Roll the dough into the shape of a log. Carefully roll the dough so it can resemble a log and then close the seams by pinching them. Cut off any excess dough at the edges with kitchen scissors. Slice off pieces of the dough to create a cinnamon roll. This can be tricky to do with a knife so you may prefer using dental floss for easier slicing. Each cinnamon roll should be about 1 \u20442 inches (4 cm)  thick. Place the cinnamon rolls in the foil pans and set aside. Cover the pans with plastic wrap and set it aside in a warm area to rise for about 30 minutes. Baking, Icing and Serving Preheat the oven to  350 \u00b0F (180 \u00b0C).  Remove the plastic wrap off from the pans.  Bake the cinnamon rolls in the oven for about 25-30 minutes. Allow them to bake until the edges and tops are golden brown.
