Your doctor will diagnose you based on your symptoms and the findings of tests, such as blood and stool tests, colonoscopy, computerized tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or a capsule endoscopy.

          "description":"Anti-inflammatory medications are usually the first line of treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease. These medications can help to control the symptoms of Crohn's disease. However, CBD oil may provide some anti-inflammatory effects, so it is possible that taking CBD in place of or along with anti-inflammatory drugs could ease your symptoms. Ask your doctor if this is a possibility. Common types of anti-inflammatory medications for Crohn\u2019s disease include corticosteroids, such as prednisone and budesonide, and oral 5-aminosalicylates, such as sulfasalazine and mesalamine. Your doctor may also recommend immune system suppressors to reduce inflammation, such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, methotrexate, natalizumab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab."

Administering CBD oil this way will bypass your digestive system, so it will work more quickly (in about 15-30 minutes) and there will be less risk of gastrointestinal issues. It also requires no special equipment. Repeat the dose every 4-6 hours or as indicated by the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

However, taking CBD oil this way requires purchasing a vaporizing device if you don\u2019t already have one. Be sure to check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for how much of the oil to use in your vaporizer to get the desired dose. Try inhaling 1 time and waiting for a few minutes. If it has not produced an effect within a few minutes, repeat the dose. This delivery method requires more frequent doses since it leaves your system more quickly than it would with other methods. Repeat the dose every 2-3 hours to maintain the effects."

This is a convenient way to take CBD oil, but the food that the CBD oil is mixed into may cause stomach irritation for some people. If your Crohn\u2019s disease symptoms are flaring, try a different delivery route. Eating CBD oil is also a slower delivery method since it has to pass through your digestive system. This mean that you might not feel the effects for 30 minutes or longer."

For example, you could rub topical CBD oil over your abdomen if you\u2019re experiencing abdominal pain. Applying CBD oil topically may provide 4 to 6 hours of pain relief. Be aware that it\u2019s harder to get a precise dose if you rub it onto your skin instead of taking it orally or smoking it."

High doses of CBD oil\u2014between 150 to 600 mg\u2014may produce a sedative effect.Tip: Do not increase the dose any more once you find the level that works for you."
