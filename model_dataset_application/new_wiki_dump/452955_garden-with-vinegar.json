          "description":"Combine 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar and 4 litres (17  c) of cool water together in a watering can or jug. Next, stir both ingredients together using a long utensil. Pour the mixture over your plant beds to lower the pH, which can help certain plants (e.g., azaleas, rhododendrons) to thrive. Check if your plants grow better in an acidic environment before watering them with vinegar solution. If the plants do better in an alkaline environment, then the mixture could do more harm than good."

If you want to use an all-natural weed killer before turning to a pesticide, try using pure white vinegar. Pour the liquid over the weeds until both the soil and plant are saturated with vinegar. Be careful whenever you use vinegar. The acid in vinegar can cause serious bodily harm when concentrated more than 11%. Use eye goggles and gloves to prevent any injury."

You can also use white vinegar to clean hummingbird baths and clay pots."

Cover any surfaces near where your pet likes to prowl, as the smell will drive them away. Try and spray vinegar on a daily basis, or however often your pet goes through your garden. Citrus spray and lemon peels can also work for this. Vinegar is also a great hazing option for scaring away coyotes.

Place these corncobs in spots where the rabbits tend to frequent to give these rodents a sour surprise! If you don\u2019t have enough vinegar to completely submerge your corncobs, spin them around in the bowl so all surfaces are coated with vinegar. Use as many corncobs as you need.
