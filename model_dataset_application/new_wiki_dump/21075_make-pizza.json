          "headline":"Spread pizza sauce on the crust.",
          "description":"How much pizza sauce you add is purely a matter of personal preference. If you love a lot of sauce, go ahead and slather it on. If you prefer your pizza on the dry side, spoon a little in the middle and spread it around in a thin layer. If you want to make a white pizza, add a little extra olive oil and skip the pizza sauce. You can make a quick pizza sauce using tomato paste, a can of diced tomatoes, and some spices. Simmer the paste and tomatoes (without draining them first) together over low heat. Add salt, oregano and pepper to taste. Continue simmering until the sauce cooks down to the consistency of pizza sauce."

          "headline":"Add toppings.",
          "description":"Layer your favorite toppings over the sauce. Add as many or as few toppings as you want. Put the heavier toppings, like onions, chicken or sausage, on the bottom layer, and add lighter toppings, like spinach leaves or peppers, on the top layer. Continue until your pizza is loaded with the amount of toppings you like. Other than pepperoni and ham which are pre-cooked, meat toppings should always be cooked before you put them on the pizza. They'll get heated when you bake the pizza, but they won't fully cook. If you're using ground beef, sausage, chicken, or another meat, cook it thoroughly in a pan on the stove or in the oven and drain the grease before you add it to your pizza. Remember that if you add too many vegetable toppings, your pizza crust may turn out a little soggy. The water from the vegetables moistens the dough. Limit the amount of spinach and other \"watery\" vegetables you put on your pizza if you're worried about this happening."

If you're working by hand, the dough will become difficult to stir when it starts to thicken. Put down the spoon and  knead the dough until it reaches the right texture. If the dough looks wet after you've been mixing or kneading it for a long time, add some flour to dry it it up a little."

You can let the dough rise in the refrigerator instead. This takes about 6 - 8 hours. You can also freeze the dough before it rises and let it rise when you're ready to make pizza."

If your oven tends to run cool, turn the temperature up to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C). If you're using a baking stone or pizza stone, place it in the oven so it gets preheated as well.
