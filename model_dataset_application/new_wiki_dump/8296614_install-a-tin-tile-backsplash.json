          "headline":"Measure the area of the space you need to fill.",
          "description":"Determine where you want to lay your tin tiles. Use a tape measure and get an accurate measurement of the space where your tin tiles will lay. Mark the space on your wall where your tiles will lay with blue painter's tape or a pencil. This measurement will also indicate how you will cut your tin. Measure any spaces you may need to cut due to electrical outlets as well. If you\u2019re installing the backsplash so it meets your countertop, move the stove and screw a 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) behind it so that it\u2019s even with the top of the countertop. This will ensure the tiles are level and even across the whole wall as well as prevent them from slipping down."

          "headline":"Remove any old tiles or paneling you may have installed previously.",
          "description":"If you are installing tin tiles over existing tile, you may not have to remove the tile unless you want an entirely even wall. If you need to remove wall tiles, you need to remove the surrounding grout first, then use a tool like a chisel to dislodge the tile from the wall. The surface of your wall should be clear of dust and dirt. Try to make the wall as even and smooth as you can by sanding it. If the tiles are adhered to drywall, it\u2019s often easier to replace the drywall since removing the tiles from it can cause damage. If you have cracking paint, you need to sand off the cracking paint before proceeding."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Apply plywood to uneven or flaking walls.",
          "description":"If you are working with an uneven wall or a wall that needs to be sanded, you can screw in a piece of plywood to the area as an alternative to sanding before installing your tin tiles. This will give you a flat surface to work on and will give your adhesive something to stick to. Measure a piece of plywood that will fit your space and attach it to the wall before placing your tiles. You can screw, nail, or glue your plywood to the wall. Opt for true plywood over OSB or engineered plywood. If your wall is already a smooth and even surface you can skip this step."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cut your tin tiles according to your measurements.",
          "description":"Using a straightedge or square, draw lines on your tin tiles that correspond to the measurements that you took. These lines will help guide you when you make your cuts. Use a sharp metal cutting tool like small tin snips or metal shears to cut through the tin. Consider overlap and make sure to remember to cut holes for electrical outlets or other things that need to be visible on the wall. When you've completed cutting, use sandpaper to dull down the sharp edges of your tin backdrop. If you are cutting thicker metal tiles, you can use a utility knife to score a straight line to weaken the tile. Then work each side of the tile back and forth until it breaks on the perfect line. Wear thick leather gloves to protect you while using your cutting tool."

For instance, if applying it to drywall, using silicone adhesive is a great option. If you are applying it to tile, however, a resin based ceramic tile adhesive like epoxy may work best. Other options include superglue and double-sided adhesive tape. Purchase adhesive at a hardware store or online."

If you're using embossed tiles, make sure to spread enough adhesive to fill in the back of the tin, because tin tends to dent. If you are using adhesive tape, put a continuous strip on the top and bottom of your tin tiles."

Rub the surface of the tile with your hands and make sure that it's laying evenly on the wall. Make adjustments to your tile before the glue dries. Using a level will also give you an additional level of precision when working with the tile."

          "headline":"Use nails to fasten your tin tile backdrop to the wall.",
          "description":"First, drill pilot holes into the corners of each tile to prevent them from cracking. Then, use a nail gun or a hammer to nail the backdrop into your wall or plywood. Use nails that match the color of your tin backdrop so that they blend in and aren't obvious. Put a nail in each corner of your backdrop. If you want to add extra stability, you can add extra nails in between your four nails on each side of the backdrop. Make sure that the nail is flush with your tin backdrop, so it doesn't get snagged on someone's clothes."
