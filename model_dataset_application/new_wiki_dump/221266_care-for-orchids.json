Though the correct temperature varies based on the species of orchid, in general you should aim to keep your home above 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C) at night.

If the humidity is less than 40%, use a spray bottle with a fine mist setting to lightly mist the orchids and their potting medium once per day.
