Be sure to check back every so often; the maps are sometimes redrawn as conditions change. The main factor determining your risk is whether you are in a floodplain or not, which you can check with flood maps. Several other factors put you at risk for floods. For instance, if your main floor is below the base flood elevation in an area, you're at risk for flooding. You're also at risk if your near a body of water, such as a lake or a river. You're especially at risk near the ocean."

          "description":"That is, know the best ways in and out of your neighborhood and other areas of the city when it's flooded. You'll need to stick to higher ground if you need to evacuate. Also, have a planned meeting place for your family members if you get separated. Have the plan written down. Go over it together so everyone knows what to do. The best way to plan an evacuation route is to use flood maps, which will show where the worst flooding will be in your area. When planning your evacuation route, have an established place to go. For instance, you can set up a plan with a friend ahead of time to evacuate to his or her house, or go to your workplace if it is out of the flood zone. Many communities also have areas designated for emergencies where you can go."

Have enough carriers for all your pets so that you can evacuate them with you if needed. Carries keep pets contained so you can evacuate them without harming them. Don't forget to include other items for your pets. They'll need containers for food and water, as well as food and their normal medications if you evacuate. Remember, not all emergency shelters will allow pets. Also, try to take something that will remind them of home, such as a toy or blanket. If you must stay in your home, move your pets to the highest point in the house with you."

If you live in an area with higher risk, it will be more expensive, but it will be worth it if flooding ever destroys your home. In fact, you are required to have it in a high risk area if you have a federally insured loan. You can get insurance through a federal program, the National Flood Insurance Program, by filling out forms on their website."
