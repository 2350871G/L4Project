  "text":" Roll off about a 2 foot/60cm section of yarn from the spool.  Locate the top of the yarn (the side with the black loops).  Locate the knitting needles. You'll need  needles of a size US 6 (4mm). Pick up the 2 foot section of yarn. Hold it by the top loops (the spool should be placed to your right). Pick up one of the needles and hold it horizontally while still holding the yarn in your other hand. One hand should be holding the horizontal needle, and the other should be holding the yarn by the top loops. Locate the first full loop on the end of the 2 foot/60cm piece of yarn.  Stick the end of the needle through the first loop on the top of the yarn. Once the loop has been \u201ccast on\u201d, keep it near the pointed end of the needle, to make it easier to cast on the rest of the loops Repeat Step 7 until there are 7 loops on the needle. Use your thumb and other free fingers to gently pull down on the yarn to help keep it attached to the needle. Hold the needle with seven loops in your non-dominant hand. Be careful because the loops can easily fall off. Always keep the needle horizontal, and place your index finger gently along the top of the needle resting on the top of the loops to secure them in place. Locate the cast on loop closest to the pointy tip of the needle. However, do not move your index finger from the top of the needle. Pick up the other needle and insert the pointy end into the end loop, but this time it will go in from underneath, making the two needles cross each other.  Hold the crossed ends of the needles with one hand. Then pick up the remaining section of yarn. Locate another top loop and loop it onto the bottom needle.  Pull the top needle upward while moving the bottom needle slightly to the left in order to release the loop onto the bottom needle.  Repeat steps 10 through 14 until the desired length of scarf is met.  Cast off each loop one by one, until only one remains. The scarf is now ready for wearing or giving as a gift.",
