Consult a solar power installation company in your area to get a better idea of how you can connect your home to a solar panel system. Total installation costs of an average solar power system \u2013 including solar panels, a battery, a backup generator, and professional installation \u2013 averages around $40,000 USD."

If you\u2019re near a river or creek, you could get a micro hydropower turbine installed as a backup system. Otherwise, you could get a wind turbine installed near your house. Talk to renewable energy companies in your area about your options and, if you wish, get a backup system installed. A domestic wind turbine costs around $10,000 USD. Micro hydropower turbines have a wide range of costs. A small one can cost around $7,000 USD, while a large one (which produces more power) can cost over $55,000 USD."

To keep energy costs low, replace incandescent bulbs with LED bulbs. This simple change can reduce electricity use by 75%. Additionally, turn lights, TVs, and other appliances off when you\u2019re not using them."

Call several cabin rental agencies in a location near the area you intend to live off the grid. Spend a week or so in one that most closely approximates the sort of home you plan on living in. While the amenities and features of a particular cabin might not be exactly the same as those that you\u2019ll include when moving off the grid, spending time in such a cabin could help you better determine what you\u2019re looking for.

You could choose to move to a plot of land that is isolated and rural but still within easy reach of stores, hospitals, and family. On the other hand, you could live in a totally self-sufficient home or trailer far from anyone else. The distance you choose to remove yourself to depends only on your preferences and personality.
