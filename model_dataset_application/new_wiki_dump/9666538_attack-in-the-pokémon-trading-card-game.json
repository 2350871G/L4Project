In order for you to use one of your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s moves, you must have the right amount and type of energy attached to that Pok\u00e9mon. You can find the energy cost at the left side of the attack name. If you do not have energy in your deck, there is no way to attack, or win, at the game. You will see some energy cost with a white star symbol. That means you can make a random energy choice and attach it to that Pok\u00e9mon. It does not matter what it is. If you see a symbol with a specific picture, like a fighting energy or a lightning energy, however, you must have that specific energy attached to your Active Pok\u00e9mon. You may see some symbols as a grey, blank circle. This means you do not need an energy attached to the Pok\u00e9mon; you can use the move directly!"

Some attacks have instructions at the bottom. Read that first before you attack, for it could be something you need to do before you attack. If a Pok\u00e9mon has total damage to its HP (life points) or more, it is automatically Knocked Out. Put the Pok\u00e9mon that was Knocked out, and all cards attached to it, in the discard pile.

If your opponent does have Pok\u00e9mon in plays, but you managed to take your last prize card, you also win the game. If you knock out a GX Pok\u00e9mon, you get two prize cards! When you attack, you do not discard your energy needed for the attack, unless stated otherwise on the attack move"
