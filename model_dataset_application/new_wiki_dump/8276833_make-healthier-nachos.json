          "description":"There are many different ways you can make nachos and no single recipe is \u201cright\u201d or \u201cbetter.\u201d The two fundamental ingredients of nachos are tortilla chips and cheese. Some of the other popular items people use in their nachos include:\nMeat, especially ground beef\nBeans, refried or whole\nPickled jalape\u00f1os\nOlives\nSalsa\nGuacamole\nSour cream"

          "headline":"Try an alternative to store bought chips.",
          "description":"Tortilla chips are often laden with salt and fat. As a way to make your chip base healthy, consider trying store bought chips made of grains such as quinoa or baked instead of fried options. You can also make your own chips or use a vegetable such as sweet potato or zucchini in place of corn chips. Look around the chips aisle at your local food store. You\u2019ll likely notice standard corn and wheat chips, but may also see many companies are now providing healthier alternatives made of quinoa or flaxseed. Read the nutrition information on the product label to see which suits your health needs best. Cut thicker slices of sweet potato, zucchini or even beet for an even healthier \u201cchip.\u201d Bake these before you make your nachos so they\u2019re crunchy like a chip. Make your own healthy chips by cutting 12 tortillas into 6 slices each. Then place each chip on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for about 6 minutes at 350\u00b0 F (175\u00b0 C) and turn over with a pair of tongs. Leave in the oven for another 6-9 minutes and sprinkle with a small dash of salt to flavor."

          "headline":"Select a healthier cheese.",
          "description":"Nachos wouldn\u2019t be nachos without the ooey-gooey delight of cheese. Like chips, cheese can also be laden with fat. If you\u2019re trying to be healthy, find a cheese that won\u2019t hurt your meal but still give you all of the flavor of \u201cregular\u201d nachos. Finding options high in calcium and protein can also boost the healthy factor. Try cheeses that are naturally less caloric. These include Parmesan, feta, goat cheese, and part-skim mozzarella. Even a processed cheese such as Velveeta can be lower in calories than more traditional options. Buy low-fat varieties of pre-shredded cheddar, Monterey Jack, Colby or other cheeses. Consider using less cheese on your plate if you want to stick with a favorite, possibly less healthy cheese. Grating it finely will cover the entire platter without adding excess fat. Good quality may be better than a huge quantity."

          "headline":"Substitute unhealthy ingredients.",
          "description":"The basic and popular ingredients of nachos can be very bad for any person\u2019s diet. They may be lacking in important vitamins and nutrients in addition to being high in empty calories and fat. However, substituting less healthy options with healthier alternatives can provide you a satisfying and more nutritious nacho. Use lower fat beef as well as chicken or pork for your protein. You can also use other proteins such as tofu or tempeh. Try whole kidney and black beans instead of refried beans. Soaking dry beans overnight and using them on your nachos increases their nutritional value significantly. Remember that you will need to cook them. You can also use vegetarian or vegan refried beans or mash you own beans for healthier options. Opt for low sodium canned beans. Sprinkle on only fresh vegetables that you chop instead of pre-cut or canned options. Make your own salsa and guacamole with only fresh ingredients and no oils. Choose low- or nonfat sour cream and cheese."

Not only can a variety of veggies make for more lively and eye-catching nachos, but they also provide you vitamins and nutrients to maintain your health. Some fresh vegetables you could add to make your nachos more healthy include:\nDiced red, orange, yellow, or green pepper\nGrilled corn\nMushrooms\nDiced red onions\nFresh tomatoes\nRoasted squash or sweet potato cubes\nShredded lettuce\nLimes or lime juice\nAvocado chunks"
