Apply it first to the perimeter of the area that you\u2019re fertilizing, and then go back in a horizontal striped pattern across the area. If you feel like this won\u2019t be enough, go back over and apply the fertilizer sparsely in perpendicular stripes. It\u2019s better to use too little fertilizer than too much, as plants and flowers will already receive some nutrients from the soil."

Always pick up and dispose of your pet waste properly in a waste bin to keep the nutrients from getting into a water supply. This is especially important to do in your yard and parks and public spaces to prevent runoff. If you don\u2019t pick it up, it can remain in the same place for a long time until the chemicals have seeped into the ground and water. Keep your dog on a leash when it's going to the bathroom so you know exactly where its waste is."
