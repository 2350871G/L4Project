Ignore the port labeled \u201c10A,\u201d which is used for measuring really high currents. Turn the multimeter on. The black terminal is the ground, and the red probe is for the active current. This matters more if you\u2019re checking voltage, and there isn\u2019t any special difference between the cords themselves though. The terminals are the exposed metal pieces at the end of the black and red cords. They measure electrical currents."

If the number on the multimeter is less than 1, then your multimeter is functioning correctly. If the reading is a flat 0, that\u2019s fine too. Most multimeters will also beep if the signal is good to indicate that the continuity setting is working properly. If there is no beep or you get a high reading, check the dial to make sure you\u2019re on the right setting. Then, check the ports that your terminals are plugged in to. Finally, try replacing your terminals before consulting your manual to find out how you can reset the multimeter. If the screen displays a 1 all the way on the left-side of the screen and not where it normally displays readings, it usually means that the signal is broken. This is a sign that your terminals are bad. It\u2019s okay if the number fluctuates a little."

Continuity is tested by sending a small current through the 2 terminals and reading the resistance on the current. If there is another current on top of the signal being sent, the multimeter won\u2019t read the correct resistance.Tip: You obviously can\u2019t unplug a wire or fuse. Don\u2019t worry about turning these off if they\u2019re not already installed in something. Take any removable fuse out and test any hooked up wire by turning the appliance, car, or device off first. If you\u2019re testing an outlet that is already installed, flip the breaker on the fuse box for the room that the outlet is in to shut off the current. Some devices, like hot tubs, radios, or car systems, will store a charge even after the power is off. Wait at least 1 hour after unplugging these systems before testing them."

If you\u2019re testing a wire, stick the black terminal on either end of the exposed wire. If you\u2019re testing soldering, put the terminal directly on the material. The metal piece at the end of the terminal must maintain constant contact with the piece that you\u2019re testing. If you\u2019re testing an outlet, unscrew the faceplate and unscrew the outlet\u2019s mounting screws. Pull it out a little and put the black terminal on the metal screw on the side.

Warning: If the reading is higher than 10, then your device, wire, appliance, or fuse will overheat. While this may not be an issue for short-term use, it can lead to long term problems and is dangerous. If there\u2019s a 1 on the left-hand side of the screen, it probably means that the reading is too high for the screen to register.
