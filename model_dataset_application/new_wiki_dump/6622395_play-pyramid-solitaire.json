Because suits don't matter in pyramid solitaire, a well-shuffled deck isn't vital for a good game, even with a brand new pack of cards. Deal a single card face up. This card will be the \"top\" of your pyramid tableau. In solitaire, a tableau is the large central layout and the main source for free cards.
