      "description":"There are multiple methods to doing so; among them are:\nHave a game where you can get a Charmander, either as a starter or as a special Pok\u00e9mon that you obtain, and soft reset (A+B+Start+Select on a Game Boy, Game Boy Color, or Game Boy Advance, and L+R+Start+Select on a DS or 3DS) until you get a shiny Charmander. Breed for one. The easiest method is through the Masuda method, which gives you a higher chance of breeding a shiny Pok\u00e9mon if the two Pok\u00e9mon you breed with come from different countries. (for X and Y) Find a Friend Safari with Charmander in it and go into it. Encounter Pok\u00e9mon until you find a shiny Charmander. Find one on the GTS and trade for it."
