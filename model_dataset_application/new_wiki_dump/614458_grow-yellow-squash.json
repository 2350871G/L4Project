Since one yellow squash plant produces enough squash to last a small family all summer, there's no need to buy more than one packet of seeds. Yellow squash comes in two varieties: bush and vining. The bush varieties take up less space, while vining varieties spread out over the garden bed. Choose the one that best suits your needs. If you don't want to buy seeds, you can wait until the weather has warmed and your local garden store has yellow squash seedlings available. These have already germinated and sprouted, and are ready to be planted directly in the garden."

When squash plants become waterlogged, they tend to rot and die before the season is over. You can plant squash in rows or on hills, with three to five seeds per hill. If you're planting a vining variety, make sure the planting spot is large enough to accommodate a plant that will spread out over six feet or so in all directions. To check whether a planting site has good drainage, dig a hole and fill it with water. If it drains quickly, the spot will work well. If the water stands in a puddle, look for a place with better drainage or mix in extra compost to amend the soil. Make sure you have good soil for growing squash. If you have grown vegetables in that location in the past, all you need to do is add a little compost. Otherwise, conduct a soil test."
