Kathryn Kellogg, the author of 101 Ways to Go Zero Waste, says: \"The best way to reduce electronic waste is to get out of the mindset that you have to upgrade your device every 1-2 years.

Because of this, sometimes people will actually buy a new printer, rather than replace the ink, because it ends up being cheaper anyway. But you have better options. Even if the cost-difference is minimal, think about the waste you are producing. It\u2019s typically much easier to find a location that recycles ink cartridges, than one that recycles the entire printer."
