An open basket will show off your blankets, but if you would rather keep them out of sight, there are baskets with lids to choose from as well. Keeping the blankets rolled up will allow the basket to hold more blankets."

Small blankets, like baby blankets, may even fit in a vinyl shoe hanger for a quick and easy nursery storage solution."

If you use a wooden box, it is a good idea to keep something between the blankets and the wood. Acid-free paper, typically used for archiving documents and photographs, is a great choice for this."
