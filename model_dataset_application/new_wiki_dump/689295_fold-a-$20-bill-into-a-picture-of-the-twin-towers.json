Some 9/11 conspiracy theorists contend that the hidden towers on the $20 bill were a sign from the U.S. government\u2014or some shadowy, powerful organization\u2014foreshadowing the event. Some of these theorists even believe that the U.S. government had a hand in orchestrating the attacks. If you are interested in the conspiracy, do your research and try to understand why people believe this \u2013 but take everything you read with a grain of salt."
