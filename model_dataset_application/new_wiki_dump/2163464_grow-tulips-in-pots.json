          "description":"Your pot should be anywhere from 6.5\u201318 inches (17\u201346 cm) deep. It's important that the pot you get has drainage holes in it. Larger pots will be able to hold more tulip bulbs, which will create a fuller pot of flowers. You can purchase plastic, ceramic, or terracotta pots to plant tulips. A 8.5 inch (22 cm) pot can hold anywhere from 2-9 tulip bulbs. A pot that is 22 inches (56 cm) in diameter will be able to hold approximately 25 medium-sized tulip bulbs. Drainage holes are important so that water doesn\u2019t pool on the bottom of the pot and rot the bulbs."

          "description":"Purchase a porous, fast-draining soil from a home and gardening store or online. Perlite and vermiculite potting mixtures are great mediums for tulips. Work outside and carefully pour the bag of potting mix into the pot. Potting soil is often better than the soil you can get in your yard or garden because it will retain moisture better, it\u2019s filled with nutrients that promote growth, and it will have better drainage."

Push the flat side of the bulbs deep enough into the soil to hold them in place. The pointed end of the bulb should be facing up. Planting more bulbs will result in more flowers, but it will increase the competition for nutrients and water. If you\u2019re crowding the bulbs, be sure to water and apply fertilizer regularly."

To do this, simply cover the top layer of bulbs with 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of soil, then plant another layer of bulbs above the first layer before covering them with potting soil. When the bulbs bloom, they will fill up the entire pot. Cover the top layer of bulbs with 5\u20138 inches (13\u201320 cm) of soil.

Prevent squirrels and other animals from eating your tulips by keeping them indoors, putting a wire mesh over the soil, or fencing them in.
