          "description":"All snakes, venomous or otherwise, will not pursue a human being unless provoked. Know that you are a larger predator and that the snake will keep to itself if you don't bother it. If you see that the snake has coiled itself up and opened its mouth wide, then you know that it sees you as a threat. Step away slowly to avoid any further risk. Remember that snakes are positive forces in our ecosystem, controlling rodent and insect populations. While it's not comforting to see one in your home, you really don't want to kill it, as it does control pest populations within your area. Prevent cruelty against snakes by not acting out in fear."

You'll also want to keep your eyes out for the iconic rattling tail. If you think that you may live in an area where one of these species lives, make sure that you can identify them.Four major species include:\nThe Copperhead. A pit viper with a tan and copper coloration. Their bites are very painful, but rarely fatal. The Coral Snake. The most dangerous of the four. They can be recognized by their red, yellow and black stripes. Know that they can be easily mistaken for the Milk snake, a harmless beast, because of their very similar colorations. While the colors are the same, the patterns on the two species differ. The rhymes \"Red on Black, friend of Jack\" and \"Red on Yellow, kill a fellow\" will help you differentiate between the Milksnake and the Coral Snake, respectively. The Cottonmouth. A quick, cranky snake with a brown and olive body. When threatened, they will stand their ground and flash the light \"cotton\" lining within their mouths. The Rattlesnake. The most infamous and recognizable snake on this list, the Rattlesnake has a brown coloration with lighter stripes, as well as its iconic rattling tail. There are also a wide variety of different vipers, cobras, and other venomous snake breeds. Check your local wildlife brochure to see what may be lingering in your area.

Their motion is also far more unpredictable, especially with your pets, and they are more likely to agitate the snake. Calmly move them away from the danger so that you can safely deal with the snake. If you suspect that your pet has been bitten, bring them to your local veterinarian or call National Animal Poison Control. There may be some redness, swelling, or bruising on your animal.

Be sure to wear some sort of hand protection, either gloves or oven mitts, before handling a snake. Approach the snake slowly, being careful not to scare it. The best way to hold a snake is directly under its belly, near the tail. Inch your hand underneath its body, keeping a solid, but not overly firm grip. You don't want to injure the snake by squeezing too hard. Let it slither in your hands a bit, as this will make it feel more comfortable. Walk it away from your property and release it safely into nature. If you've trapped the snake under a blanket or other cloth material, you can scoop it up and transport it outside that way.

If you come across a snake outside your property, you should also leave it alone. If the snake is not venomous, then it is of no real risk to you. It should find its way out of the yard on its own terms, and it's unlikely that you'll have to worry about its presence. If the snake is venomous, then you can quickly evacuate the area and get further removal help. Never attempt to kill a snake.
