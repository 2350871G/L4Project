While you're doing that, review a subject or area they've been learning. Have the children sit in a circle facing inward, choose a child to be the picker and use your topic as for the basis for the words the picker will say while he or she is tapping heads. For instance, if you were going over shapes, the picker might say \u201csquare, square, rectangle.\u201d The picker will circle around, tapping heads and saying \u201csquare\u201d until finally saying \u201crectangle.\u201d When rectangle is called, that child chases after the picker.

This can be modified for seasons of the year, characteristics of plants and trees, parts of the body, colors, elements of writing, for math, etc. For example, if students are learning how to count, write a number on a piece of paper and put it in the center of the circle. Have the picker go around the circle tapping on each child\u2019s head, counting from 1 upward until that number is called. When it is, that child then chases the picker.
