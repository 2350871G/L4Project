Pick a jar or pitcher big enough to hold the amount of tea you want to make. You can cut open the tea bags to help the water and tea blend, but it's not strictly necessary. Alternatively, add 1-2 teaspoons (0.6-1.2 g) of loose leaf tea for every 6 to 8 fluid ounces (180 to 240 mL) of water. If you're using loose-leaf tea, try brewing it in a French press for easy straining the next day. Just add the water and loose-leaf tea to the pitcher of the press, and pop the lid on, leaving the plunger sticking up. The next day, press down on the plunger slowly to strain the tea leaves from the water and pour the tea out."

If you want to sweeten your tea, try simple syrup or honey, as straight sugar won't mix very well. Brewing Loose-Leaf Tea with Ice Place a large ice cube in a small glass. Use the type of ice cube you would see in whiskey or scotch, the large square or round ice cubes. These melt more slowly than other ice cubes. If you don't have the right kind of ice cube tray, make a larger ice cube in the bottom of a disposable cup. Pour in the water, and place it in the freezer until it's solid. To get the cube out, turn the cup upside down to run water on the bottom for a few seconds, which will help the cube pop out. Splash a tiny bit of water onto the ice cube. You really only need a few drops. The water helps the ice begin to melt, making the process go just a bit faster. If you prefer, you could use a few drops of a flavored simple syrup instead. Sprinkle on 1-2 teaspoons (0.6-1.2 g) of loose-leaf tea. Add the leaves to the glass. You can sprinkle them on top, but don't worry if they fall down the side or even under the cube. Really, it's fine for the leaves to fall anywhere. In fact, you can add the tea before the ice if you prefer. Let the cube sit for 30 to 60 minutes until the ice melts. As the ice melts, it will extract flavors from the tea. Once it's completely melted, try a sip to see if the tea is too strong. If it is, you can add a bit more water before consuming it. Pour the tea through a strainer. If you don't mind drinking around tea leaves, you can simply leave them in. Otherwise, remove them by pouring the tea through a fine mesh strainer. Making Ice Brew Tea Quickly Add 3 regular ice cubes to a glass. You don't need to measure these. Any standard ice cube tray or ice maker should work. Plus, you can always adjust the brew by adding more water at the end if it's too strong. Boil 0.25 cups (59 mL) of water and let it cool a bit before pouring it in. Use water that's just below boiling, as boiling is just a bit too hot. Let the water cool for 2-3 minutes, then pour it over the tea. Sprinkle in 1-2 teaspoons (0.6-1.2 g) of tea leaves. It doesn't matter where the tea leaves go. You can put them under or on top of the ice. The water will reach them eventually. Leave the tea to steep for 6 minutes. The tea will steep a lot more quickly than other cold brew or iced brew methods. Once the ice has completely melted, the tea is ready to drink. If the tea is too strong, add a dash of cold water.",
