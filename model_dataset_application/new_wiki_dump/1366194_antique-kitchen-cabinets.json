          "description":"Antiquing is a process by which you put a dark \u2018antique\u2019 stain over the top of cabinets that are painted or stained a few shades lighter. That means that the base color for the cabinets can be anything you like, be it painted white or stained oak. You can antique over your current cabinet color if you so desire, but many people like to go for a totally transformed cabinet look by adding a new base color as well. Examine your space and consider your overall d\u00e9cor to determine what the base color of your cabinets should be. Generally, it is best to stay away from very dark base colors, as the antiquing effect won\u2019t show up as well on them. Cabinets painted white or stained with a light, natural wood stain are very popular for their \u2018shabby chic\u2019 appearance when antiqued."

          "description":"The antique stain is the dark stain that will be painted over the top (and then wiped off of) the base color on the cabinets. While any matte stain will work, it is recommended that you select a stain advertised for its antiquing qualities. This is because antique stains are made to be the right opacity, luster, and color to convey an authentic antique appearance. For white and cream cabinets, choose a mid-tone antique stain. For honey/caramel tone cabinets, chose a medium to dark stain (depending on the desired contrast). For dark cabinets in a chocolate or coffee hue, you\u2019ll want to choose the darkest antique stain available. Antique stains cost about the same as regular wood stain, so you\u2019re not losing out financially by going with this option. The higher the contrast between the antique stain and the base color, the more worn and vintage the cabinets will appear when finished."
