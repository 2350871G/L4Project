To pick a genre, consider what types of games you like to play, what the goal or mission of the game will be, and what you want the user experience to be like. For example, if you like games you can play with a group of people, you might make a multiplayer online role-playing game. Choosing a Video Game Genre\nIf you're an adrenaline junkie, pick an action or adventure game. If you love solving brainteasers and mysteries, go for a strategy or puzzle game. If you like getting into character, make a role-playing game, like Dungeons & Dragons. If you prefer a little gore or violence, try a first-person shooter game."

          "description":"The most important part of a video game is telling a story that captures the interest of the player. Brainstorm the overarching problem that players are trying to solve and build off of that. Make sure there are multiple ways to \u201cwin\u201d the game to provide more entertainment for the players. For example, if you want the goal of the game to be finding a pot of gold, create characters like an evil leprechaun who\u2019s trying to protect the pot and a storyline of events that might happen throughout the player\u2019s journey, like the appearance of a magical rainbow."

Keep the game going by incorporating new challenges throughout the story, along with different levels that players can unlock as they go along. Having a beginner\u2019s level along with more advanced levels also means more people can play your game. It won\u2019t exclude any players. You can create different levels for the same goal, or make levels get progressively harder throughout the story. For example, you can have a beginner\u2019s option and an advanced option for trying to slay the evil leprechaun. Or you can make the first step, like finding the leprechaun, easier, then make the next step, like getting inside his lair, a little more difficult, and so on."

          "description":"Before you jump into coding and development, you need to have a clearly defined plan and vision for how your game will run and what it will look like. Create a storyboard by sketching out the major scenes of your game in each frame, along with details on what will happen in that scene. Place the images in order of occurrence in the game. Include details like what actions the characters will take in each scene, what the background should look like, whether there will be any special effects or sounds, etc. For instance, using the leprechaun example, 1 frame might be searching the woods for the leprechaun\u2019s cave. The storyboard would have a description of the woods, what animals or elements the character might run into, and whether the character can run, jump, or even swing from the trees. The more in-depth your storyboard is, the easier the development stage will be, since you\u2019ll be more prepared."

There are \u201cdrag and drop\u201d programs available where you simply insert your storyline, characters, actions, rewards, etc., and the software writes the code for you. This allows your to focus on the storytelling and concept, rather than the technical details and coding. GameMaker Studio and Unity 3D are 2 of the most popular programs for video game development.

You can use online classes or tutorials to teach yourself the basics to start building your game. Some of the common programming languages used in designing games are JavaScript, HTML5, ActionScript 3, C++, or Python. After you master the basics, learn the application programming interface (API) for your coding language. This basically is a set of instructions for how your code will interact with other software or programs. Open-source game development programs also provide extra support and sample code for creating games. For example, if you want your character to climb the wall of the leprechaun\u2019s cave, you can find a pre-made coding sequence for a climbing motion, then tweak it to fit your game."

Instead, work on building the main components of the game, like what happens when a player catches the leprechaun or how many pots of gold they have to find to advance to the next level. Keep your prototype as simple as possible if you\u2019re a beginner. You can always build on it later.

If something doesn\u2019t run smoothly or if you have ideas for improvement, jot them down so you can go back later and correct them. You can also have your friends and family to playtest the game. Ask them for honest feedback about their experience. Don\u2019t just test for functionality. Test for how fun the game is, too!

While similar in some ways, each platform differs in how much freedom you have as a developer along with how much money you\u2019ll spend or make. For instance, Android allows you more flexibility with custom functions and features because it\u2019s an open-source platform. iOS tends to be easier to develop apps on since its programming language (Swift) is less involved than Android\u2019s (Java). You\u2019ll have a better chance of making more money if you use iOS. The App Store generates almost double the revenue of Android\u2019s equivalent, which is Google Play. You can build for both iOS and Android, but it will be more expensive since each one has its own coding structure and requirements. If you want to use both platforms, it\u2019s best to start with just one since you have limited time and resources.
