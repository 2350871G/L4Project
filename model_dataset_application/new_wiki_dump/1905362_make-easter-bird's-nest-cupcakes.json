  "text":" Making the cupcakes Preheat the oven to 190\u00baC, 375\u00baF.  Cream the butter or margarine and sugar together in the mixing bowl.  Beat in the eggs gradually.  Fold in the flour and cocoa.  Arrange the paper cake cases on a baking tray/sheet, keeping them close together to prevent spreading during baking. If preferred, place the cupcake cases into the holes of a muffin pan to help prevent spreading. Add around a teaspoon of mixture to each paper cake case.  Place in the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until they are springy to the touch. Remove from the oven. Allow to cool on a wire cooling rack. Decorate the cupcakes. Select one of the following choices to make nests atop the cupcakes. Buttercream nests Make the buttercream icing while waiting for the cupcakes to cool, if not already made.  Pipe the icing onto the cupcake in a round, tall/wide circle on the edge of the cupcake. You might need to make more than one layer to make it appear like a nest. Place just enough icing in the middle of the cupcake to cover the cake surface and keep the eggs in place. Place the eggs (about 2-3) in the middle, inside the \"nest\". Arrange them so that they sit side by side. Coconut nests Spread the vanilla buttercream over the top of each cupcake.  Sprinkle the coconut over the top. Be generous with the coconut\u2013\u2013the more added, the more it looks like a little nest, especially if you're using shredded coconut. Arrange 3 little eggs in a neat formation in the centre of each cupcake.  Grated chocolate nests Spread the vanilla buttercream across the top of each cupcake.  Sprinkle a generous amount of grated chocolate mostly in the centre of the cupcake.  Arrange 3 little eggs in the middle of the grated chocolate nest. You might need to dig a little to attach the eggs properly to the icing/frosting so that they don't fall off. Chow mein noodle nests Spread the buttercream across the the tops of each cupcake.  Place a chow mein noodle nest complete with eggs in the centre of each cupcake. ",
