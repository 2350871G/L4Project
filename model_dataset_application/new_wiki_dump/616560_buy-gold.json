Gold bullion is the only true hedge against this kind of instability. Term of Investment: For the long term, even if the economy picks up, inflation will follow close behind.

          "description":"You have a choice of gold coins, gold bars, and gold jewelry. Gold coins: Historic (pre-1933) gold coins tend to retain the most value, as these have numismatic value in addition to their gold content. Examples of historic gold coins that do not sell at an excessive premium over the gold price because they contain only 90 percent gold are the British sovereign, British guinea, Spanish escudo, French 20 and 40 francs, Swiss 20 francs, and American Gold Eagles ($10 face value), Half-Eagles ($5 face value) and Double Eagles ($20 face value). The British sovereign and the American Eagle gold coin are notable exceptions with 91.66 percent gold content (or 22 karat). Other gold bullion coins include the Canadian Maple Leaf, the Australian Kangaroo, and the South African Krugerrand (which sparked the entire gold-coin-investment industry),  and the 24 karat Austrian Philharmonic. Gold bars: Gold is also sold in bars that are usually 99.5 to 99.99 percent fine (that is, pure gold). Popular gold refineries include PAMP, Credit Suisse, Johnson Matthey, and Metalor. You\u2019ll see the names of these refineries stamped on the bars they process. Gold jewelry: The problem with buying gold jewelry as an investment is that you pay a premium for the craftsmanship and the desirability of the design. Any piece of jewelry marked 14 karat or less will be below investment quality, and any resale for the sake of investing will be impacted by the need to refine the gold. On the other hand, it is possible to pick up antique or vintage gold for very little at estate sales and similar auctions where a seller may not recognize the true value of the metal content or if people simply aren't in the mood to bid much for it. Older pieces can carry more value due to their unique craftsmanship, so this can be a lucrative and enjoyable way to collect gold."

You can make a lot of money buying gold futures if the value of gold goes up relative to your currency, but if it goes down, you can lose everything you invested and possibly more (if your futures contracts do not simply get sold to someone else when you do not have enough money down).
