In order to play, you\u2019ll want to memorize the different rankings (or have them written out in front of you if you\u2019re playing at home) so you can bet strategically. The hand rankings in order from best to worst are:\nRoyal flush: 10, jack, queen, king, and ace in the same suit. Straight flush: any straight in the same suit, like 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of hearts. Four of a kind: 4 cards of the same rank. Full house: 3 cards of the same rank plus 2 cards of the same rank. Flush: any 5 cards that are the same suit. Straight: 5 cards that are consecutive in rank, like 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Three of a kind: 3 cards of the same rank. Two pair: 2 cards of the same rank plus 2 different cards of the same rank. One pair: 2 cards of the same rank. High card: can be any card, but the higher the better (ace is the highest)."

          "description":"In Omaha Hi Lo, there are 2 winners at the end of each round: the player with the best hand, and the player with the lowest hand. If you\u2019re the player with the highest hand (meaning your hand has the highest poker ranking), you automatically win half of what\u2019s in the pot. For example, if you end the round with a 4 of a kind, and none of the other players have anything higher than a 4 of a kind, you take half the pot."

          "description":"In addition to putting together your best 5-card poker hand at the end of each round, you\u2019ll also be making a low hand. The lowest hand is the hand with the lowest cards in it, with ace being the lowest. You can use the same cards to make your low hand as you use to make your best hand, or you can use different cards. However, in order to qualify for the low-hand pot, your hand cannot:\nContain any pairs. Contain any cards that rank higher than an 8.Note: Straights and flushes don\u2019t count in a low hand."

          "description":"In Omaha Hi Lo, every player gets 4 face-down cards, called hole cards, at the beginning of each round. Then, 5 community cards are played face up on the table throughout the course of that round. When it\u2019s time to make your best and lowest 5-card poker hands, you have to use 2 of your hole cards and 3 of the community cards for each hand. For example, even if you were dealt 4 aces face down, you wouldn\u2019t automatically have a 4 of a kind since you can only use 2 of your face-down cards to make your hand. Alternatively, if 4 aces were dealt face up on the table, you could only use 3 of them to make your final hand. You can use different hole and community cards for your best and lowest hands. For example, if you had a king, king, 2, and 3 in your hole cards, you could use the pair of kings for your best hand and the 2 and 3 for your lowest hand."

When you\u2019re playing at home, the person with the dealer button is responsible for dealing out the cards at the beginning of that round. If you\u2019re playing Omaha Hi Lo at a casino, the dealer will always be the casino employee who\u2019s working at the table.

In Omaha Hi Lo (and Pot-Limit Omaha), there\u2019s a small blind and a big blind. The player to the left of the dealer button plays the small blind, and the player to their left plays the big blind. When playing at a casino, the value of the small and big blinds will probably be predetermined. If you\u2019re playing at home, agree what the blinds will be with the other players. For example, you could make the small blind $1.00 and the big blind $2.00. Just remember that the minimum bet is always equal to the big blind. The small blind is typically half the value of the big blind. When it\u2019s your turn to post a blind, place it on the table where you\u2019d normally bet."

For example, if you end the round with a 4 of a kind, and none of the other players have anything higher than a 4 of a kind, you take half the pot.

The lowest hand is the hand with the lowest cards in it, with ace being the lowest. You can use the same cards to make your low hand as you use to make your best hand, or you can use different cards. However, in order to qualify for the low-hand pot, your hand cannot:\nContain any pairs. Contain any cards that rank higher than an 8.Note: Straights and flushes don\u2019t count in a low hand. Use 2 of your face-down cards and 3 community cards to make your hands. In Omaha Hi Lo, every player gets 4 face-down cards, called hole cards, at the beginning of each round. Then, 5 community cards are played face up on the table throughout the course of that round. When it\u2019s time to make your best and lowest 5-card poker hands, you have to use 2 of your hole cards and 3 of the community cards for each hand. For example, even if you were dealt 4 aces face down, you wouldn\u2019t automatically have a 4 of a kind since you can only use 2 of your face-down cards to make your hand. Alternatively, if 4 aces were dealt face up on the table, you could only use 3 of them to make your final hand. You can use different hole and community cards for your best and lowest hands. For example, if you had a king, king, 2, and 3 in your hole cards, you could use the pair of kings for your best hand and the 2 and 3 for your lowest hand. Getting Set up Pass out the dealer button to one of the players. Like in Pot-Limit Omaha, Omaha Hi Lo has a dealer button that gets passed around clockwise throughout the game. When you\u2019re playing at home, the person with the dealer button is responsible for dealing out the cards at the beginning of that round. If you\u2019re playing Omaha Hi Lo at a casino, the dealer will always be the casino employee who\u2019s working at the table. However, the dealer button still gets passed around to determine who goes first. Have the 2 players to the dealer\u2019s left post the blinds. A blind is a required starting bet that forces every player to bet if they want to play that round. In Omaha Hi Lo (and Pot-Limit Omaha), there\u2019s a small blind and a big blind. The player to the left of the dealer button plays the small blind, and the player to their left plays the big blind. When playing at a casino, the value of the small and big blinds will probably be predetermined. If you\u2019re playing at home, agree what the blinds will be with the other players. For example, you could make the small blind $1.00 and the big blind $2.00. Just remember that the minimum bet is always equal to the big blind. The small blind is typically half the value of the big blind. When it\u2019s your turn to post a blind, place it on the table where you\u2019d normally bet. Wait for the dealer to pass out 4 cards face down to each player. The deal should start with whoever is sitting to the left of the player with the dealer button. Then, it continues clockwise. The dealer should pass out 1 card to each player at a time, going around the circle a total of 4 times so every player has 4 cards. When playing at a casino, the employee at the table will deal for you. If you\u2019re playing at home, have the player with the dealer button deal out the cards. Playing a Round Let the player to the left of the dealer button call, raise, or fold. They should look at their hole cards without showing them to anyone, and decide if they want to bet or fold. Since there won\u2019t be any face-up community cards at this point, they\u2019ll need to decide based on just their hole cards. If they choose to call or raise, they should put their bet in the center of the table. If they choose to fold, they should discard their cards. Keep in mind that the minimum bet is equal to the big blind. So, if the first player wants to stay in, they\u2019d need to bet at least what the big blind is. For example, if the big blind is $2.00, the first player could bet $2.00 to call or more than $2.00 to raise. Continue betting clockwise until each player has called, raised, or folded. Let the person to the left of the first player bet, then the next player to the left, and so on. The player that has the dealer button always bets last. Unlike Pot-Limit Omaha, there\u2019s no maximum bet in Omaha Hi Lo. Wait for the dealer to deal 3 cards face up on the table. These first 3 face-up cards are called \u201cthe flop.\u201d The dealer should deal them face up in the center of the table so every player can see them.Tip: Community cards can be used by every player. You have to use 3 of them for both your best and lowest hand, but you can use different cards for each hand. Have all the players who haven\u2019t folded yet bet again. Bet clockwise around the circle again, starting with the remaining player who\u2019s closest to the dealers left. For the second stage of betting, take the face-up community cards into consideration when you make your bet, along with your hole cards. If at any point every player folds except for one, the remaining player wins the pot. Wait for the dealer to deal 1 additional card face up on the table. This community card is known as \u201cthe turn.\u201d The dealer should place it face up next to the first 3 community cards. Now there should be 4 community cards on the table. Have the remaining players bet again. Continue betting in the same way, going around the circle clockwise. Only the players who haven\u2019t folded yet should still be betting at this point. Remember that, when it\u2019s your turn to bet, you always have 3 options. You can bet the same as the previous player to call, you can bet more than them to raise, or you can discard your cards to fold. Wait for the dealer to place 1 final face-up card on the table.

However, if none of the other players seem confident in their hands, or if you think they\u2019re bluffing, you might want to stay in just in case. Winning a Round Have everyone who\u2019s still in for that round turn their hole cards face up. If you\u2019re still in, go ahead and turn all of your hole cards up, even if you\u2019re not planning on using all of them to make your hands. If you\u2019ve already folded, you\u2019re not required to turn your hole cards up, unless you want to. Give half of the pot to the player who has the best hand. Remember, the best hand is whichever hand has the highest poker ranking. Count up the pot, divide it in half, and give half of it to the winning player. If the pot can\u2019t be split evenly, leave the extra chip or coin in the center of the table for the next round.Tip: If 2 players tie for the best hand, they each receive a quarter of the pot. Award the other half of the pot to the player with the lowest hand. The lowest hand is the hand with the lowest cards in it.
