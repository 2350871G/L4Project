It may take two years for the seeds and plants to establish themselves, but once they do, your yields will increase every year. Buying seeds of your chosen rhubarb plants can give you a never ending supply of this tangy vegetable. Soak the seeds for 1-2 hours before planting to speed germination. Then add 2 seeds per 2- to 3-inch pot. Keep the plants in a warm area to speed germination. If they are in a sunny spot, make sure the plants have afternoon shade during the hottest months."

Plant additional crowns about 3 feet apart."
