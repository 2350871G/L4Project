If your cactus has a deep root system, like saguaro or cardon, choose a pot that is narrow and deep. Most cacti have shallow root systems. If you are unsure which type yours has, choose a pot that is somewhere in between (like a bonsai pot)."

          "description":"Whether you choose a heavy, durable pot made of clay or an easy-to-clean plastic pot, just be sure that excess water can escape the container. Without drainage holes, the soil will remain too moist and this can lead to root rot and will eventually kill your cactus. If you pick out a pot that doesn\u2019t have adequate drainage, you can easily drill holes in it."

Look for it at garden centers, home improvement stores, nurseries, or online. As an alternative, make your own soil. Simply combine one-third horticultural soil (like commercial-grade potting mix), one-third high-quality horticultural sand (washed, coarse, and sharp), and one-third grit (such as porous gravel, lava fines, or fired clay). This mix will give your cactus the proper nutrients and drainage required to keep it healthy and thriving."

Put on gardening gloves to protect your hands from the cactus spikes. Tip the cactus upside down and gently squeeze the container while tugging gently on the cactus to remove it from the pot."

Lightly tamp down the soil around the cactus when you're done. Then, lightly water the soil so it compacts. Aim to get the soil damp, but don't soak it so much that water runs out of the drainage holes at the bottom of the pot."

The growing season for cacti is during the spring and summer while the temperatures are hotter and there are longer periods of daylight. Depending on the type of cactus and soil as well as the amount of sunlight and heat the cactus gets, you may need to water more or less than once per week. If the cactus feels mushy, you're watering it too much. Other signs of overwatering include rotting and brown or black leaves.

Do not allow your cactus to stay in this condition for very long\u2014the lack of sunshine may also mean the soil stays too moist for too long. For a slight lean that happens over time, simply rotate the pot occasionally. Be careful when transitioning the cactus to a brighter location. Sudden intense light can scorch it and cause permanent damage, so increase the sunlight by small amounts at a time. For instance, if the cactus gets 4 hours of sunlight a day and doesn't seem to be thriving, move it to an area that gets 6 hours of sunlight a day rather than 8 hours of sunlight a day."
