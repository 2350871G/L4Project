          "description":"A rocks glass is a small glass tumbler that holds between 6 to 10  fl oz (180 to 300 mL). These are often decorative and you can purchase them alone or as part of a whiskey decanter set. Drinking your Jameson from a rocks glass will promote a smooth drinking experience. Keep in mind that you can drink whiskey out of any glass you want. For example, you could pour it into a ceramic coffee mug, a tin cup, or even a disposable plastic cup if that\u2019s what you want to use."

          "description":"If you want to experience the full spectrum of flavors in the whiskey, then don\u2019t add anything to it. Simply pour a 1.5  fl oz (44 mL) serving of room temperature Jameson into a rocks glass or other drinking vessel, and enjoy! You can pour a larger serving if you prefer. Just remember that whiskey is a very strong drink so it is best to drink only a small amount at a time."

          "headline":"Add 1 large ice cube to chill your Jameson.",
          "description":"If you want to chill your Jameson, use a large ice cube. Using multiple small ice cubes will quickly dilute the Jameson and cool down the alcohol which this will mute the flavor. To make Jameson cold without adding too much water, add a large cube-shaped or spherical ice cube to the glass. You can purchase special ice cube trays for whiskey. Check culinary stores and online retailers to find a large spherical or cube-shaped ice tray. If you want to chill Jameson without water, then purchase a set of whiskey rocks. These are granite or stainless steel cubes that you freeze and add to whiskey in place of ice."

If it still tastes too strong, add another 0.5  fl oz (15 ml) of water and taste it again. Repeat until the Jameson tastes how you want it to. You may find it easier to detect subtle flavors in the whiskey even after adding a few drops of water."

Then, take a deep breath in through your nose to inhale the scent of the Jameson. Take a small sip and let the sip linger on your tongue for a moment before you swallow. Common scents and flavors you might notice include toffee, vanilla, and caramel."
