There are many types of double-sided tape available, so be sure to select one that is designed for outdoor use, as these are often the strongest adhesives. This will ensure that the tape can withstand the elements and remain attached to your stucco wall. Scotch and Gorilla Glue are two popular brands of double-sided tape. Check your local hardware store for mounting tape. You can also shop for double-sided mounting tape online."

Make sure the area is fully dry before applying any tape!"

Peel the backing off of one side of the tape and attach to the object so that it is not visible when you hang it. Double sided tape is strong enough to hold up to 5 pounds (2.3 kg), sometimes more, but be sure to use enough to hold the object on the wall and distribute its weight evenly. If you plan to hang a frame, apply the strips of tape to all corners of the frame. If you\u2019re hanging an uneven object, apply the tape to all the areas that will contact the stucco and be sure to use enough tape to support it. Double sided tape comes in a variety of colors as well, which can make concealing the tape easier."

Slowly pull the paper backing off of the adhesive. The sticky surface of the tape will begin to dry and lose its strength after you remove the backing, so be sure you are ready to hang the object on your stucco wall before you remove the backing!"

You\u2019ll need to hold the object you wish to hang tight against the stucco for about 10 seconds to allow the tape to grip onto the ridges of the stucco. Then gently remove the pressure against the object. You can lean your weight onto the object to apply pressure."
