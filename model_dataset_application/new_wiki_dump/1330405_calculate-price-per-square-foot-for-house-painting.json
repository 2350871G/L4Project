          "description":"To calculate the area of exterior walls, measure the perimeter of the house, or the combined length of all exterior walls. Exclude porches or other \u201cappendages.\u201d Multiply the perimeter by the height of the roofline, or the spot where the top of an exterior wall meets the roof. If your house has gables (peaked parts of the roof), add half the height of a story to the total roofline height to get a ballpark approximation of the area including gables.Tip: Don\u2019t bother subtracting the area of any doors or windows from your measurement. The extra paint you\u2019ll end up with based on this calculation can be used to cover things like porches, railings, and window frames. Most houses have a height of 9 feet (2.7 m) per story. Add 4.5 feet (1.4 m) to account for any gables. For example, if your house is 24 feet (7.3 m) by 35 feet (11 m) and 2 stories tall, the area in square feet would be (24 + 24 + 35 + 35) x (9 + 9 + 4.5) = 118 x 22.5 = 2,655."

For smaller areas, you can use the rule that 1 US quart (0.95 L) of paint covers 100 square feet (9.3 m). If you need multiple coats of paint, multiply your estimate by the number of coats you plan to use.
