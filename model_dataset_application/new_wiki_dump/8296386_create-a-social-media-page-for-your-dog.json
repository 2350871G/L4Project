Embrace these differences and use it as a positive when thinking of ideas for your dog's social media page. Think about details surrounding how your dog acts, and try to attribute human traits to them. For instance, if your dog is always curious and getting into trouble, you can create a mischievous and sarcastic personality for them. If your dog is really human-friendly and subdued, you can create a relaxed, friendly persona for your dog."

Decide whether you are creating it to show off images of your pet or if you are creating it to post funny and quirky commentary. Certain social media platforms lend themselves to commentary while others are better for photos. In addition, you should pick one that you use personally so that you feel more comfortable using it. If you're posting photos, platforms like Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest are great. If you want to say witty things as your dog, Twitter or Facebook are good platforms. If you post a lot of videos, consider a video sharing platform like Snapchat."

If creating an account on Facebook, make sure you use the \"Pages\" option instead of creating a real account, or it may get deleted. Other platforms care less about \"fake\" accounts or accounts created for people's pets. You may have to try multiple account names because they may have been already created."

Upload photos and videos that you've taken of your dog and share them with people that are following you so that they can like and share them with their networks. If your dog is fun-loving and energetic, use a photo of them being active, like swimming or catching a ball. If there is a place for hobbies you can put something like, \"running after squirrels, playing catch, and cuddling with my owner.\" Remember to include contact information for potential advertising opportunities."

Try to catch your dog during candid moments when he's not paying attention to make photos more organic. Think of the photo's composition and whether it's capable of eliciting an emotion out of people who see it. Make sure that your dog remains the focal point of the picture and that it's interesting or impressive. Turn off the flash, as it can often startle or scare dogs. Try to capture times that make your dog interesting and unique. If your dog is camera shy, try offering some treats to get them to open up. A panting dog often looks like they are smiling. If you want a happy looking dog, go for a brisk jog or walk with them before the photo shoot. Make the background engaging and interesting to look at as well."

This means that you'll have to use a photo editing software to get them exactly right, or the page may look strange or broken to some people. Edit and resize the most important photos that are on your page. For instance, the cover picture image size for Facebook is 851 x 315 pixels. The header image for Twitter is 520 x 260 pixels. The profile size for Pinterest is 165 x 165 pixels. Read how to Resize an Image in Adobe Photoshop."
