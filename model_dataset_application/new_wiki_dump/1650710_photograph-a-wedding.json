For outdoor weddings, know when and where everyone will be during the golden hour. This is the timeframe after sunrise or before sunset when natural lighting is warmest and softest."

Having this conversation will avoid the couple getting upset over any missed opportunities. Know who the couple\u2019s VIPs are. That way you can showcase the moments the couple and their families want to remember."

          "description":"Long lenses will allow you to shoot intimate moments like the ceremony from far away without getting too close and disrupting the scene. Wide lenses will allow you to take pictures of groups in tight spaces. Artistically, you can also use a wide lens to make pictures appear bigger and capture the whole scene."

          "description":"Image stabilization will prevent a shaky hand from warping a photograph. High ISO settings like 3000 and beyond create sharper images. If your images end up being too sharp or noisy, you can always edit them digitally using a noise reduction function in your editing software."

          "description":"Flash often creates a harsh light that discolors the subject of the photo. Good flash diffusers usually range from $20 to $60. They create a softer light by bouncing the flash off nearby surfaces. Try to use natural light over flash when you can to avoid discoloration. Church lighting tends to be dimmer and requires flash photography."

By the end of the night, the wedding attendees will also know who you are and likely ask for a few pictures. Have an official set-up somewhere with your tripod so people know where to find you, but keep in mind you will still want to be mobile most of the day."

Shooting in RAW will also stop your camera from automatically balancing the highlights and shadows in the picture so you will get a more realistic photograph. In order to shoot quickly in RAW, you need higher quality memory cards because they will slow down the camera."

To look for candid shots, look for people doing things or people interacting with each other. Using a long lens, you will be able to zoom in to focus specifically on the subject\u2019s face or their interaction with another person. This type of composition will be more interesting because it provides a singular focus on a mundane action. A shallower depth of field aperture around f/5 or below will blur the background, bringing even more focus to the subject in action."

When taking pictures of something up close like a table setting or a vase, use a shallow depth like you would with a candid shot. When photographing a church interior or a garden at an outdoor wedding, use a wide angle lens to capture more of the scenery and set your aperture higher than f/8. More of the photo will be in focus and you will capture the vastness of the scene."

Just be unobtrusive about it. Silence your camera. Turn on the silent shutter setting. Turn off all sound on the camera.

It may be helpful to bring a ladder or to shoot from a higher vantage point so you can get everyone in the shot."
