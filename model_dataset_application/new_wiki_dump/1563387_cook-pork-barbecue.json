  "text":" Steaming the Pork Place 2 12-oz. (354 ml) cans of beer, the juice of two limes cut in half, the lime halves and 6 cloves of garlic in the bottom of a roasting pan with a rack. Mix together 1/4 cup (57 grams) of salt, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of coarse-ground black pepper, 1/8 cup (28 grams) of granulated garlic and 1 tbsp. (14 grams) of paprika in a bowl. This mixture is the pork rub. Rub the pork rub into a 10 to 12 lb. (4.54 to 5.44 kg) pork butt or pork shoulder. Place the pork on the roasting rack with the fat cap facing up.  Cover the roasting pan tightly with aluminum foil, but arrange the foil so it is not touching the pork.  Bake the pork in an oven for 8 to 9 hours at 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 Celsius).  Smoking the Pork Preheat your grill to 225 to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (107 to 121.1 Celsius) for about an hour before steaming is done. Make a fire to one side and leave room for the roasting pan on the other side. Remove the roasting pan from the oven and take off--but save--the tin foil.  Take 4 cups (.946 liter) of the liquid from the roasting pan and place it in a bowl. Leave the remaining liquid in the pan. Put the roasting pan on the grill on the side opposite the heat source. Do not cover the pan. Place 1 cup (110 grams) of soaked hickory wood chips or chunks on the fire and close the lid of the grill to smoke the meat. Soak the wood chips for an hour in water, beer, wine, whiskey or any liquid with which you want to flavor the meat. Cook for an hour, adding soaked wood chips as they burn. You will use about 4 cups (440 grams) of wood chips over about an hour. Place the wood chips in aluminum foil right over the flames if you are using a gas grill. Test to see if the meat is cooked fully by lightly twisting a bone. The pork is fully cooked and smoked when the bone comes out without resistance. Pulling the Pork Take the roasting pan out of the grill and cover it with aluminum foil for 45 minutes.  Discard the fat cap.  Pull medium-sized pieces of pork off the bone and place them in a bowl.  Shred the pork with a couple of forks, if necessary.  Strain the juices from the roasting pan that you set aside into a separate bowl. Add the juices to the pork a little at a time until the meat is moist, but not wet. Mix the meat with a barbecue sauce you like and serve the barbecue pork on buns or as tacos or tortillas.
