If it doesn\u2019t come up easily, try grabbing the corner of the carpet with a pair of pliers and then gently tugging it away from the tack strip. Once you get started, it should pull away like a zipper. Don\u2019t pull the carpet up on all sides of the room. It needs to remain anchored on two opposing walls. Don\u2019t pull too hard, as this could separate the fibers and damage the carpet. If you\u2019re having serious trouble getting the carpet up, contact a professional."

Wear work gloves while handling old and new tack strips as they are made of setting nails on one side and razor-sharp tacks on the other. It\u2019s also a good idea to wear protective eyewear to keep you from being injured by flying splinters or tacks. Place old pieces of tack strip in a bucket or cardboard box near you. This will keep your work area clear of these sharp objects to prevent you from putting a knee or hand down on the exposed nails."
