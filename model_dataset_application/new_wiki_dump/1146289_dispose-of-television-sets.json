However, most waste companies give paying customers the option of dropping off old TVs at a site for recycling. Depending on the company, you may need to show a driver's license or utility bill to gain access to the site. Most of these centers accept TVs and other items, such as cameras, small appliances, cell phones, CD players, and photocopiers."
