If you're playing Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, or LeafGreen, you'll need to transfer Gligar to a Generation IV game in order to evolve it. You can transfer from Generation III to Generation IV, but you can't transfer from Generation I or II to Generation III. This means that a Gligar from Gold, Silver, or Crystal cannot be evolved into Gliscor, because it cannot be transferred to a version that supports it. To transfer from Generation III to Generation IV, you'll need to have received the National Pokedex in your Generation III game. Insert the GBA cartridge in your DS and select \"Migrate\" from the main menu of your Generation IV game. Select Gligar and five other Pok\u00e9mon you want to migrate. In your Generation IV game, visit the Pal Park on Route 221 to catch your migrated Gligar."
