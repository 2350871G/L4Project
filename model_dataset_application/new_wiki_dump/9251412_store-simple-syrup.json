Making Simple Syrup Make hot-process simple syrup for a longer shelf-life. Add equal parts sugar and water to a saucepan. Heat it over medium heat, stirring constantly, until all the sugar is dissolved. Remove it from heat, turn off your burner, and allow the mixture to cool. Make sure you don't let the mixture boil, as this will evaporate the water and affect the ratio of sugar to water. Make cold-process simple syrup to avoid heating the mixture. Put equal parts sugar and water in a jar or bowl. Mix or shake vigorously until all the sugar has dissolved. This may take some time, as sugar dissolves more slowly in cold water than in hot. You can use any temperature of tap water, it does not need to be cold. The method is called cold-process because you don't heat the mixture on the stove as you do in hot-process. Play around with the ratios to change the flavor and consistency. Depending on what you plan to use simple syrup for, you may want it more or less sugary. Adjust the ratio of sugar to water (e.g., 2:1) until you find a flavor and consistency you like. Keep in mind that the more sugar you use, the longer the simple syrup will last. Flavor your simple syrup, if desired. Once you remove the sugar and water mixture from heat, add your chosen flavoring, such as a sprig of rosemary, an orange rind, a cinnamon stick, or a vanilla bean or two.
