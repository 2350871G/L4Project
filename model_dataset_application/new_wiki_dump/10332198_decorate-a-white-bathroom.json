          "description":"Adding mirrors to your bathroom helps give the illusion of depth to what could be an otherwise monochromatic and potentially claustrophobic space. A mirror with an embellished frame not only adds depth, it adds a touch of character to the space as well. You can add a single, large mirror over your vanity or try hanging a few smaller mirrors around your bathroom. You could also try hanging several small mirrors in a pattern on one wall. Try choosing an unconventional shape or painting the outside of the mirror to add a pop of color."

          "description":"Wall art can help add a splash of color to your bathroom and help you express your artistic side. You should avoid loud colors, however. Try for pieces of art with softer, lighter colors with lots of white space. You could also hang black and white photographs, since they won\u2019t interfere with your white color scheme at all. Avoid frames with glass over them or anything else that might not do well with the humidity. Opt for art that is on a canvas with a wood frame."

          "description":"Antique linens will soften the hard lines of your bathroom, add a touch of class, and serve as a conversation point for guests. Hang your hand towels on a tiered towel rack, and then intersperse them with the linens to add some texture to your bathroom design. If you don\u2019t have any of your own antique linens, you can usually find them in antique stores. Look for linens with detailed hand embroidery."

          "description":"Hang short floating shelves in a diamond pattern on one of the walls of your bathroom. Mark their position beforehand by drawing straight lines with a pencil where you\u2019d like them to go. Then, drill pilot holes, insert hollow anchors, and screw brackets into place. In addition to plants and mementos, you can also put books, framed pictures, or baskets for storage on your floating shelves. Make sure that you do not clutter the shelves with too many items! Try putting cotton swabs and cotton balls in jars, or roll up a few towels and place them on their sides to make your bathroom look like a spa."

For heavier ones, you can mount a curtain rod on the wall by following the instructions in the curtain rod\u2019s packaging. Regardless, make sure to mark off where you want your tapestry or blanket beforehand to ensure that it is level when you hang it. If the tapestry or blanket is particularly delicate, you can stretch it over a frame and hang the frame. You can find frames at most craft stores."

Then, drill a pilot hole, insert a drywall anchor, and screw your hooks into place. You can use the hooks to hang plants, baskets, framed art, or other items of your choosing. For a unique touch, you could use drawer knobs instead of hooks. Simply find drywall anchors your knobs can screw into, mount the anchors, and screw the knobs into the wall."

          "description":"Some flowers do particularly well in bathrooms, especially tropical ones. The combination of low light, high humidity, and warmth helps them thrive. Keep a vase of tropical flowers like orchids, chrysanthemums, begonias, or hibiscuses (or mix and match them) to give your white bathroom a pop of color. To arrange your flowers in your vase, cut the stems at an angle to your desired height, then arrange the largest flowers in the center, and work outwards in a circle with progressively smaller blooms. If allergies are a concern or you\u2019d rather not have to deal with flower upkeep, you can also use fake flowers, which can be purchased at most major craft stores. A bamboo or air plant is a good option for making your bathroom seem more spa-like! These do well in moist environments without much light."

Look in particular for soaps and candles in light colors to add a pop of color to your bathroom without overwhelming the white tones. Arrange the candles in the center of the basket, and position the soap bars around them in a layered circle. Make sure that the designs on your decorative soap are visible from the basket. Find soaps and candles with floral or citrus scents like lilac, lavender, orange, or lemon to keep your bathroom smelling fresh year-round. Try putting the basket in different places around your bathroom to see how it looks. The best places are usually a windowsill, a shelf, or the back of your toilet."

Look for rugs that have simple patterns and light colors. A rug with dark colors and a complicated pattern will interfere with the simple aesthetic of your bathroom. An accent rug with some earthy tones like brown, green, tan, and gray would also go well with a white bathroom. Try a striped rug or a rug with simple shapes like diamonds or squares. Keep in mind that the rug is likely to get wet, so choose an expensive rug that is easy to clean."
