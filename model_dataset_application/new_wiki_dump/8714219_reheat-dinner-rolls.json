Place them in a 400 degree Fahrenheit (204 degree Celsius) oven for 10-25 minutes until they are completely reheated. You can gauge the doneness of the rolls by looking for a golden appearance and by breaking open a test roll to see if the interior is warm. You can also place the rolls into a brown paper bag with a few sprinkles of water on top. Close the bag tightly. Place this bag within a 350 degree Fahrenheit (176 degree Celsius) oven and bake for 10 minutes."

Carefully remove the roll and continue the process, being careful not to burn your hands. You can also do a combination method where you start by microwaving the rolls and then move them into the toaster oven to get the crispiness on the outside. This works especially well with French bread rolls."

This will make it possible for any butter applied to the rolls to melt immediately and evenly. It will also prevent the rolls from becoming dried out as they cool in temperature."

You can even try to reheat them once more, but it will likely dry them out and negatively impact the taste. Of course, you will also want to keep an eye on the appearance of the rolls. Don\u2019t eat a roll if you see any signs of mold or discoloration."

Some of the best herb options are oregano, rosemary, and sage. You can also choose herbs that will complement the rest of the meal.
