          "description":"Only burn natural materials in your fireplace; never introduce foreign substances, including cardboard, newspaper, or paper trash. These substances burn poorly, produce a lot of smoke, and release chemicals into the air. Only burn tinder (such as pine needles or tiny sticks), kindling (small sticks or pinecones), and fuel (large logs, up to about 14\u201d long). Burning hardwood (such as maple and oak) will diminish the amount of soot and ash buildup in your chimney. Also avoid burning wood that is wet or still green, as it will produce large amounts of smoke and not burn well."

          "headline":"Avoid using flammable liquids to start fires.",
          "description":"You should never put gasoline into a fireplace. Gas is volatile, and could easily cause a fire to get out of control. If you're struggling to light a fire, use a small amount of lighter fluid instead, although it's best to just use matches and tinder. Flammable liquids are risky and raise the chances of a house fire. If your fires aren't starting consistently, hardware stores also sell small (rough 2\u201d x 2\u201d) fire-starter squares that will burn for about 15\u201320 minutes."

          "headline":"Start the fire correctly.",
          "description":"If you build your fire efficiently the first time, it will burn for longer, heat your home effectively, and result in minimal smoke escaping into your home. Start by laying your tinder at the bottom of the fire, followed by kindling. Lay the wood pieces in such a way that there will be room for airflow under the fire\u2014without airflow, the fire will go out immediately. Finally, add two or three logs on top; you can add more logs once the initial couple are burning. When you add logs to the fire, make sure to set them gently on top of the already-burning logs or coals\u2014if you throw new logs on, sparks and burning coals will fly off. Add logs one or two at a time, as you don't want to turn your quiet fire into a bonfire by adding too many logs at once. Before you place any wood in the fireplace, remember to open the damper. People often forget this step, and a closed damper will result in your fire filling your home with smoke."

          "headline":"Clean out the ashes after every fire.",
          "description":"Before lighting a new fire in the evening, you'll need to scoop out the ash from the previous fire. This will help keep your fireplace clean and attractive, and will prevent live coals from burning in your fireplace while you're away from the house. You can purchase an ash shovel at a hardware store. Also consider purchasing other common fireplace tools, such as brush and fireplace tongs or prong. The latter will allow you to move burning logs around in the fire, if they're at risk of falling out."

          "headline":"Keep a fireplace screen in front of the fireplace when in use.",
          "description":"A fireplace screen should be at least 3 feet (0.91 m) high, and most common models are be made of fine, crossed wire on a flexible, three-part frame. This screen will catch any live sparks that leap out of the fire, and will also prevent larger logs from falling out. A screen is a necessity if you have small children or animals in the house, as they could easily run or stumble into an open fire. If there are more durable models of fireplace grate available at your local hardware store, it may be wise to purchase a heavy grate in addition to (or instead of) a lighter screen."

While the fireplace is cool, open the damper (seal at the top of the fireplace) and inspect the flue (opening connecting the fireplace to the chimney). The flue should be open and clear of obstructions. Examine the hearth to make sure no bricks are damaged or missing, and that the firebox\u2014the interior of the fireplace\u2014is not cracked or damaged.

If it becomes clogged or broken, smoke will not be able to exit the chimney and could back up into your house. Make sure that the cap is in good condition, and is free from cracks, ash buildup, or birds' nests. Since you'll need to climb on top of your roof to do this, make sure to observe safety precautions.

This presents a risk, as excess buildup can catch on fire and lead to a dangerous and chimney fire. If your chimney has excess internal ash buildup, during summer months, smoky-smelling air can be drawn through the chimney into the house. To clean a chimney, you'll need a specific set of pipes and brushes that you should be able to purchase at your local hardware store. If you prefer not to clean your own chimney, a local cleaning or maintenance service should be able to do the job for you. Also inspect the chimney flashing (the seal between the chimney and roof).

You may smell smoke in the room while a fire is burning, notice damaged wallpaper on the wall by the fireplace (or \u201chot spots,\u201d where the wall adjacent to the chimney is intensely hot in certain places), or begin to notice rust around the damper or firebox. If you see any of these signs, call a chimney sweep or local fireplace-inspection service before lighting your next fire. You may experience downdrafts when using your fireplace. A downdraft is caused by air rushing down your chimney and pushing smoke and ash out from the fireplace into your home. Your chimney cap should prevent downdrafts, but if they occur frequently, inspect the chimney cap and make sure there are no branches overhanging the top of the chimney, as these can interfere with proper airflow."
