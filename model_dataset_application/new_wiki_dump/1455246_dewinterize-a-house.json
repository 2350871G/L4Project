          "description":"If you've put up insulation film on the windows, you'll need to take it down before you can open the windows. Leaving insulation film up after the winter will make it stuffy and hot inside your home. Use a hairdryer to heat up the double-sided tape along the perimeter of the windows. Once the adhesive agent is warm and soft, you should be able to pull the plastic straight off the window frame. Use the hairdryer once again to soften any adhesive that was left on the window frame. Use warm water and soap or a spray-on cleaning agent to scrub off any traces of adhesive on the window frame."

It's best to clean both the inside and outside of the windows, since it's probably been a while since the windows were cleaned. Use a spray-on cleaning agent or cold, soapy water and a sponge for washing the inside of windows. Use clean paper towels or a clean, lint-free cloth to wipe the inside of windows dry."

If you are cleaning the outside of windows on a two- or three-story house, it may be difficult or even unsafe to wipe down the windows. In this case, you may want to wash the windows using a hose, angled upward from the yard."

          "description":"Once you've cleaned the windows, you may want to check the caulking and weather strips around the windows. Caulk and weather strips can wear down over time, and if you use air conditioning in your home during the summer an air leak can cost you money and energy. Choose a caulk that is waterproof to ensure that no moisture gets into your home. Clean the edges that are to be caulked. Scrape away old, peeling caulk or paint with a putty knife or flathead screwdriver. Hold the caulk gun at a 45 degree angle around the entire window. Apply the caulk in a continuous, straight stream to every joint in the window frame and to the joint where the wall and window frame meet. Be sure that the caulk is adhering to both sides of the seams. Use a putty knife to place any errant caulk into the seam where you want it. Allow caulk to completely dry before painting or touching the caulk. Drying times vary depending on the type of caulk used, but most caulks will be completely dry within 24 hours."

Basic fiberglass or paper filters typically need to be changed every one to two months, and electrostatic or HEPA filters need to be cleaned or changed every two to four months. Even though you won't need the furnace during summer, it's a good idea to change old filters. If a cold snap hits in the spring and you turn the furnace back on, you'll want to ensure that the furnace isn't loaded up with dirt, dust, and other particulates. Be sure the furnace is turned off. Remove the service panel. If you cannot find it, consult the manufacturer's guide. Slide out the old filter. Filters are typically located near the fan inside the furnace.

Much like the furnace filter, you want to ensure that the fireplace is clean, in case a cold snap hits in the spring and you need to have a fire. Move anything that might be blocking the fireplace, and put down old sheets or a plastic shower curtain to catch any ash and soot. Use a wet paper towel to wipe down the grate inside the fireplace. Use a shop vacuum to remove as much of the ash, soot, and wood fragments as possible. Do not use a regular household vacuum, as the material you vacuum from the fireplace might clog the filter of the vacuum. Scrub the walls and floor of the fireplace with a handled brush and a mixture of warm water and a gentle soap. Have a professional chimney cleaner scrub out your chimney to prevent the risk of fire."
