  "text":" Making Marinated Salmon Season the salmon. Blend the dry seasonings\u2014garlic powder, salt, and pepper\u2014in a small bowl, and dust the salmon evenly with that. Marinate for a couple hours. Blend the lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and vegetable oil until it is well blended and the sugar is dissolved, and then pour into a large Ziploc plastic bag with the fish. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, and no more than 4. Turn occasionally to mix things up. Fire up the grill. For a charcoal grill, heap the coals to the side so you have a hot area and a warm area. Consider using real wood charcoal, as the briquettes impart a chemical taste to delicate meats. For a gas grill, set the temperature to medium heat: 325\u00b0 F (160\u00b0 C). Lightly brush the grill grate with vegetable oil.  Place the salmon on the warm part of the grill. Discard the marinade. Turn the salmon over after six to eight minutes and allow it to cook on the other side for another six to eight minutes.  Sear it. Place the salmon on the hottest part of the grill to get grill marks on it\u2014it only takes a minute or so on each side. Serve and enjoy!  Making Mayonnaise Salmon Fire up the grill.

Optional: Blueberry Reduction Sauce Do this as the salmon marinates. It takes about an hour to make, mostly unattended. Fill medium saucepan with port. Reserve about 1/4 cup port.
