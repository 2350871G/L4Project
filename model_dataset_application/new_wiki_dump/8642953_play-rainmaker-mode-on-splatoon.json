The most popular weapons happen to be snipers since you can get your enemies from afar, but as long as you can easily \"splat\" your enemies, as well as spread a good amount of ink, your weapon should be good. You also some great gear. Try getting 3-star gear, as it can hold more abilities at once. Make sure the gear you get comes with abilities to help with your weapons work more efficiently. For example, sloshers use up quite a large amount of ink, so use gear with abilities that give you the power to use less ink with any weapon. It's not just about looking good, but if it looks great and works well, then that can make you more confident in battle!"
