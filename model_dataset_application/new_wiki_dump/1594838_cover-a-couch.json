Making a Couch Cover Visit fabric stores to locate the material. Use your measurements to purchase enough fabric to create the cover. Create a template to cut your fabric. Use a pencil to outline your sofa on large sheets of paper. Use a separate piece of paper for each section, including arms, seat area, and backrest. Cut out each paper section you outlined, and place them on the fabric. These will serve as your patterns for the cover. Draw the templates onto your fabric using a pencil. Leave a .8-inch (2-cm) border around the seat pattern, and a 2-inch (5-cm) seam around the patterns of the arms and backrest, which are curved and will need a little extra room. Use fabric shears to cut out the patterns. Once you have all the sections, lay them out on your couch to ensure they will fit properly together. Remove the sections from the sofa. Sew or pin the sections together along the inside of the pattern or the sides of the material that will face the couch. Place your newly designed sofa cover onto the couch.
