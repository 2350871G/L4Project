USB port locations vary depending on the type of computer you're using. If you can't locate the USB ports, check the sides or the back of your computer's CPU (desktop) or the back of the casing (laptop). If you're connecting your controller via wireless dongle, you may need to first install the dongle's drivers. Make sure you follow the on-screen prompts to do so after plugging in the dongle."
