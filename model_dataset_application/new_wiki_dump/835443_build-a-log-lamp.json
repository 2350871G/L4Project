  "text":" Use your chainsaw and cut a 16\" section from the log of your choice with characteristics you desire for your lamp to contain. When you make your cut, be sure to try to cut it as square as possible. Simply run the cut ends of the wood on a jointer or belt sander to level up completely and make the ends smooth. Place the log in a secure vise and drill a hole in the center of the log from top to bottom with a drill and a 16\" 3/8 drill bit. Mark a line with a straight edge from the center of the exit hole on the bottom of the lamp to the side in which you wish for the lamp cord to exit with a pencil. Then route a groove about 1/4\" deep following the line you made. Using a palm sander with 100 grip paper or a piece of hand sandpaper, sand the whole log and go around all the sharp edges to give it a nice soft appearance. Sand a total of three times and work your way from 100 to 120 and a final 150. This will ensure a great finish. Spray or wipe on a very heavy coat of boiled linseed oil. While the linseed oil is still all over the lamp, use steel wool to sand the linseed oil deeper into the wood. Repeat this step three times and then dry the excess linseed oil off the lamp. Unpack your lamp kit. Your kit should have a 4\" piece of 3/8 all thread, socket, socket casing, cord, and harp holder. Place wood glue around the first 2\" of the all thread and insert it down in the top of the lamp in the 3/8 hole you drilled previously. Leave a little over 1/4\" of the all thread out of the hole. Place the harp holder over the all thread and screw the bottom part of the socket casing on to the all thread and set the set screw that is located on the bottom of the casing. Twist the end of the cord together to make a point and insert it from the bottom of the lamp and pull it out the top of the lamp. Once out of the top of the lamp, untwist the wire and connect each wire to the two screw found on the light socket. Pull from the bottom of the cord to pull the socket down tight into the socket casing.  Place the second half of the socket casing over the socket. Install a light bulb and lamp shade and enjoy.
