Flatten the cookie dough ball by pressing your hands on it. Use a rolling pin to roll it out into a large rectangular shape. Cut out bat shapes from the dough using a bat-shaped cookie cutter. Gently press the cookie cutter on the dough to cut each cookie. Lay the cookies on the cookie tray using a spatula. Leave a two inch space between each cookie to avoid them from binding together when they bake. Bake the cookies. Place the cookie tray in the oven. Have the cookies bake for about 8-10 minutes, until the edges are golden brown. Let the cookies cool. Remove the cookie tray from the oven. Lay the cookies on a wire rack by removing them with a spatula. Have the cookies cool for about ten minutes. Frost the cookies. Using a butter knife, spread black frosting over the sugar cookies. Smooth out the frosting by gently smothering the butter knife around. Cut a small piece of grey fondant and form it into a line to make the 'mouth'. Pipe two triangles near the mouth to make the 'teeth'. Pipe the eyes near the top with the white frosting. Make the 'wings' more realistic by rolling small pieces of the grey fondant and adding it on the wings. Serve the cookies on a serving plate with a glass of milk. Enjoy!",
