Most of the flavor of shortbread comes from butter, so using a fresh, high-quality product can make a big difference. The traditional choice is a European-style butter, which has a little more fat than American-style. If you only have unsalted butter, just add a pinch of salt to the recipe. It won't mix in quite as well since shortbread dough is so dry, but it's not a major problem."

The most popular choices are caster sugar, for a sandy texture, or icing sugar, for a smooth, melt-in-your-mouth shortbread. Whichever you choose, add the sugar gradually as you beat it into the butter, until light and fluffy. This takes about three minutes with an electric mixer's paddle attachment on low speed, or a bit longer by hand. In the U.S. and some other countries, caster sugar is called \"superfine\", and icing sugar is \"powdered\" or \"confectioner's.\" You may use granulated sugar, but the recipe sometimes ends up a little gritty."

Mix this into the butter mixture just long enough for it to form a soft, crack-free dough. If this takes more than six or seven minutes, slowly dribble in water, but no more than 15 mL / 1 tbsp. Electric mixers and food processors can overwork the dough, making it tough. If you use one, keep it on low and finish it by hand. The warmth of your hands helps bind the dough together. Rice flour (also sold as ground rice or rice powder) encourages the signature sandy texture. In a pinch, the shortbread should still turn out fine if you replace it with additional ordinary flour."
