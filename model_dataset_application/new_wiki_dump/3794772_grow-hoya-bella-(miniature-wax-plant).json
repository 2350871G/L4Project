Take herbaceous or woody stem cuttings in the summer. When cutting a section to plant, take at least 3 inches (7 cm). Make sure that the cutting includes at least one set of leaves. When planting a Hoya cutting, use a porous, well-draining soil. Place the cutting in a small pot (with about a 6-inch [15-centimeter] diameter). Water the plant weekly, and the Hoya will produce roots within a week or two. Keep the planted Hoya bella cutting in partial sunlight. At this stage, full sun may cause the plant to wither."

Look for a large planter, with a 12-18 inch (30-46 centimeter) diameter. This plant is a tropical or a tender perennial and is best kept in a container for bringing inside during winter months if you live in a region with frequent (or heavy) frosts."

To encourage growth, replant the wax plant every two or three years. Hoyas can thrive when slightly root-bound, so there is no easy visual method to tell when the plant needs repotting. Always replant in the spring, since this will allow the wax plant to start growing into its new pot promptly. Every time that you repot a Hoya plant, increase the pot size by about 2 inches (5 cm).
