If it will help, use a sprayer hose to dislodge dirt and grime. Be careful of sharp edges or too much rust while cleaning. If washing the canister doesn't work, consider getting rid of it"

Soaking your canister will help remove any stains or grime. If you don't remove the canister after half an hour, you could worsen rust stains."

Apply a little pressure if dirt or grime doesn't come out on your first wipe down. Be extra gentle on the outside part of your canister, especially if it has pictures, logos, or anything else you want to maintain. If you're using your kitchen sink, make sure to clean out your sink thoroughly so rust particles don't get on the same surfaces that come into contact with food."
