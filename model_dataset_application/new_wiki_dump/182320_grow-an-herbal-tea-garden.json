Pick any weeds out of the garden, and use a small shovel or spade to turn over the top several inches of soil. You can grow herbs for tea in relatively little space. If you choose to only include 1 or 2 tea herbs in your garden, you will need as little as 1 square foot (930 cm) of space."

Most herbs grow best in full sun to partial shade, so position your garden box in an area that is mostly exposed and will receive sun throughout the growing season. Keep in mind that some herbs\u2014like lemon verbena and peppermint\u2014do better in a garden box or a pot than an open garden. If you have the time and inclination, you could grow tea herbs in an existing herb garden, and build a garden box on the side.

Keep mint out of full sun, though, or it may begin to wilt. The herb can quickly spread from one part of a garden to another, so unless you want it escaping across the herb garden, keep it pot-bound. Peppermint tea is made from the leaves of the peppermint plant. The taste of peppermint is uplifting and cleansing, and can help settle an upset stomach."

Plant your lavender in well-drained soil. It prefers not to be over-watered, so only water the lavender when its soil is completely dry. Lavender buds and flowers are both used for tea. Similarly to peppermint tea, lavender tea is recommended for reducing tension in your body and soothing headaches."

It needs full sun and will not tolerate harsh winters, so keep it pot-bound and indoors if the region you live in has cold winters. The leaves are used for tea. Lemon verbena grows quickly during warm summer months, so you\u2019ll be able to collect multiple harvests."

Rose hips will form once the rose bush goes to seed. The rose hips should be deep orange-red before harvesting. Rinse the rose hips to remove clinging soil before steeping them in hot water."

          "description":"Bergamot is a popular choice for herbal teas because it carries a touch of orange flavor. The plant produces gorgeous bright red, violet, or pink flowers and grows best in full sun or semi-shade. The herb thrives in full sun to partial shade, and does best when left relatively dry. Bergamot also has mild health benefits: it acts as a digestive and diuretic, and can reduce a mild headache. Both the leaves and flowers of bergamot are suitable for steeping."

Chamomile tolerates full sun to semi-shade. Chamomile flowers are easily grown from seeds. The flowers are the preferred part for making the tea. Chamomile is visually appealing as well.

However, coriander is suitable for herbal tea and makes a tea which tastes similarly to Lady Grey tea. This tea carries a spicy and acidic flavor with strong citrus undertones. The leaves are used for tea. Cilantro thrives in full sun to semi-shade and grows best in a contained pot or small, enclosed garden. Cilantro will even grow well in a small pot placed on your windowsill."

Use the leaves for tea, but if flowers are present, you can add these to the tea as well. If you'd like to pair the herb with another in your tea, try combining it with mint. The flavor of thyme in tea is spicy and may be an acquired taste. Try a little bit first before cutting too much herb for your tea! Unlike other herbs, thyme is best grown from cuttings or by dividing mature thyme plants in 2. It also prefers poor soil with little water, so may be best grown in its own small planter."

Violets are considered to be soothing and refreshing and are a good tonic after winter. The dried leaves and flowers are suitable for steeping. Violets prefer shady growing areas and are easy planted in pots if desired. Since most other tea herbs prefer full sun, plan to grow violets in a separate planting container."

          "headline":"Plant rosemary.",
          "description":"Although it's typically used in savory dishes, rosemary also makes an excellent herbal tea. If the taste of rosemary by itself is too strong in a tea, add a few drops of honey and a squeeze of lemon juice. The plant prefers strong full sun but will tolerate light shade, and requires well-drained soil. The flavor of rosemary also pairs well in tea with lemon verbena."

This will ensure that the flavors are released and the full benefits of the herb's or flower's qualities are available. Pour the boiling water over the herb leaves in a teapot, cover, and let it steep. You can keep herbal tea in the fridge for about 2 days. However, the tea may lose some of its flavor if stored."
