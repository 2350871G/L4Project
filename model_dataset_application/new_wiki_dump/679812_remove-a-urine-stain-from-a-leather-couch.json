Do not rub the paper towels over the urine; that will simply spread out the stain. Instead, blot or dab at the urine puddle. This step may require use of a multiple paper towels. If you don\u2019t have paper towels handy, you can use a clean cloth or rag. However, take care not to use a cloth that is colored with a strong dye, since dye can easily transfer to leather and stain it."

These cleaners can be found at pet stores, drug stores, or bigger retail chains. However, before you use the cleanser on the entire stained area, it\u2019s a good idea to test it out on an inconspicuous part of your couch. A successful urine stain cleanser is \u201cNature\u2019s Miracle,\u201d which can be found in most pet stores. Consider testing the cleaner on small areas near the rear or bottom of your couch. If the cleanser reacts negatively on the leather, you will have saved yourself from ruining the entire visible area of the urine stain."

          "description":"Use a cloth lightly dampened with your chosen cleanser to wipe the stained area. Drag the dampened cloth over the area gently; you do not want to scrub the leather. Be sure to wipe the entire surface of the stained area from edge to edge, seam to seam. It\u2019s important to clean the entire surface, since you could leave a new stain on the leather if you just clean a specific area. It\u2019s better to dampen and clean the entire section of the leather cushion, rather than only treat the stained area. If you want to make your own cleaning solution, mix together 1 US quart (0.95 L) of hydrogen peroxide, \u00bc cup (58 g) of baking soda, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid dish soap. Gently combine these ingredients together in a bowl. Dip your cloth into the solution and wring it out. You can also use white vinegar as a natural alternative to hydrogen peroxide. Vinegar can help disinfect and deodorize the stained surface."

Wash the stuffing as you would wash any kind of clothing by hand, in a large sink or tub. Apply the enzymatic cleanser to the stuffing and use your hands to work the cleaning solution into the urine-saturated area. Squeeze the stuffing and rinse it with clean, running water. Do this many times to be sure you completely rinse out and neutralize the urine stain and odor. Allow the stuffing to dry naturally outside. If the stuffing can dry outside in sunlight, that may help get rid of the urine smell even more."

Apply a small amount of conditioner to a soft rag, and use the rag to wipe the entire surface of the leather. Be sure to coat all sides of the leather cushion. A leather conditioner will ensure that your leather stays soft and supple, replenishing any of the natural oils that the cleaning solution may have removed from the surface."
