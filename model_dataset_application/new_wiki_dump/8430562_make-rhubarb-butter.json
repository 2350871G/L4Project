Stir every 5 minutes with a rubber spatula. Keep an eye on the heat\u2014it needs to be hot enough to cook down the ingredients, but not so hot that it scorches the sugar or boils over."

There will naturally be a little variation in cook times, depending on the type of rhubarb you use, your individual cookware and the intensity of the heating element. Set a kitchen timer and use your best judgment to determine when the butter has cooked down sufficiently. For an extra smooth finish, press the butter through a strainer or food mill to trap stringy pulp and excess moisture."

Have a pint jar or tupperware container nearby that you can pour the hot rhubarb butter into and give it a chance to cool and thicken. Once it\u2019s set up, the butter will have a perfect spreadable texture, and will make a great addition to toast, waffles, roasted chicken, biscuits and countless other dishes! Allow the rhubarb butter to cool to room temperature before placing it in the refrigerator or freezer. Changing temperatures too suddenly may cause the jar to crack or alter the flavor of the finished product. Rhubarb butter will stay fresh in the refrigerator for 6-8 weeks, and a year or longer when frozen.
