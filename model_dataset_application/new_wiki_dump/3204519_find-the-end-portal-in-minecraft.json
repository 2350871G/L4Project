          "description":"Finding and activating an End Portal requires ingredients you can only find in the Nether, Minecraft's underworld. Make a Nether portal and travel through it to get started. To make a Nether Portal, place obsidian blocks in a rectangle four blocks wide and five blocks high, skipping the interior of the rectangle. If you are low on obsidian, you can skip the corners. Activate the lower obsidian blocks with a flint and steel. The Nether is a dangerous area. Prepare yourself with high quality food and enchanted diamond equipment."

          "description":"Blazes are yellow, floating monsters surrounded by smoke. They are only found in Nether fortresses \u2014 structures supported by pillars over a lava ocean. Defeat blazes and collect the blaze rods they drop. You'll usually need at least five blaze rods to find and activate the end portal, and it often takes seven or more. It's much easier to find Nether fortresses if you travel along the x-axis (east or west). Killing blazes is difficult, and the rods only drop if you kill them directly or with a tamed wolf. It helps to have an enchanted bow, or plenty of snowballs (it takes seven to kill one blaze)."

You'll need two ender pearls for each blaze rod. This task is made less tedious if you have the Looting enchantment on a diamond sword as it will increase your chances of getting Ender Pearls. Endermen are found in the Overworld in groups of 1-4. They do spawn in the Nether, but at a very rare chance, in groups of 4. They spawn in light levels of 7 or less. Be careful when killing the Enderman, because they're powerful enough to kill you."

There's a small chance that another structure (such as a mineshaft) breaks into the portal room. If it interrupts the portal, that portal is not usable. On a PC, you can find another stronghold.
