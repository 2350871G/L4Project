  "text":" Creating a \"Blintz Fold\" Create guidelines by folding a square piece of paper in half. Line-up the edges and corners and make a solid crease. Unfold and repeat in the other direction. Be sure to line-up the edges and corners as cleanly as you possibly can. Unfold. You should now have a square piece of paper with creases/guidelines that intersect perpendicularly in the center. Fold each corner inward toward the center. Begin with one corner, pulling it all the way toward the center point and lining it up with the guideline-creases you made earlier. Once everything is lined up, fold and crease. Try to get the tip as close to center without going past it. Do not unfold. Repeat the previous step for each corner. Once each corner is folded you should be left a smaller square. This is a \"blintz fold.\" The \"blintz fold\" is the foundation for many origami projects. Creating a Lotus Blossom Fold each corner of the blintz base inward toward the center. Bring each corner all the way to the center point of the square, and line-up the corners, edges and guidelines just as you did when you first constructed the base. Make sure the folds are on the top of the blintz base when you begin. Repeat for each corner. When you are finished, you should end-up with another square. You are essentially performing a series of blintz folds on a single piece of paper. Make another blintz fold. As you did with the previous step, fold each corner of the paper inward toward the center, lining up all edges and corners. Work each corner one at a time and be patient.
