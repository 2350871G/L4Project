          "description":"If you do not want to make pants, then you can also use a pair of old pajama bottoms for the pant bottoms of your jumpsuit. Then, all you will have to do is create a matching top and add the top to the pants. Choose a fabric color and type that matches your pajama bottoms. For example, if the pajama bottoms are navy blue and made of a jersey material, then select a similar navy blue jersey material for the top. Or, if the pajama bottoms feature a print, choose a solid in the dominant color of the print, such as red if the print is mostly red."

Smooth out the fabric so that there are no ripples. Then, place your sweatpants on top of the fabric. There is no pattern for this project, but you can use your sweatpants to help you make the jumpsuit in the right size. Fold the sweatpants in half so that the legs are lined up with each other. Then, lay the pants on top of your folded fabric. The waistband of the pants should be near the folded edge and the inseam of the pants should be facing out towards the outer edge of the fabric."

Try to make the fold as even as possible all the way around. When you find a comfortable height for the waistband, you can take off the pants.

If you are using old pajama bottoms for your jumpsuit instead of pants that you made, then you can follow the same process for attaching the tank top to the pajama bottoms. Just make sure that the bottom of your tank top matches up with the top of the elastic waistband on your pajama pants. As you sew along the edges of the tank top bottom and waistband top, pull the materials taut. This will help to ensure an even seam. It is also necessary because the tank top will be slightly larger than the waistband."
