If you are working with a round-bodied fish, such as tuna or salmon, click here. Cut the head off. Locate the head, and use your knife to make a shallow cut around it, just behind the gills. Cut the head from the body with a pair of scissors. Use the shallow cuts you made as a guideline. Make a slit down the center of the fish going from the head towards the tail. Some fish might even have a stripe going down the center of their body. Use this stripe as a guideline. Keep going over the slit until you reach the bones. When you reach the tail, cut a horizontal slit right across the tail, but do not cut the tail off. Try to get a flexible filleting knife for this. Use your knife to pry the fillet away from the bones. Gently score a line into the flesh to one side of the spine; keep the blade pointed towards the ribs. Once you can peel part of the flesh away, slide the knife down into the fish and begin cutting the fillet away from the ribs. Work your way from the head towards the tail. Try to keep the knife between the flesh and the ribs at all times. Pull the fillet away and set it aside. Repeat for the other sides of the fish. Rotate the fish, and make another cut down the center, to the other side of the spine. Saw the flesh away from the bones. Flip the fish onto its back and cut two more fillets. When you are done, flip the fish over so that you can see its belly. Cut two more fillets, to either side of its spine. You will end up with four fillets. Skin the fillets. Turn the fillet so the thinnest side is facing you. Position the knife so that it is almost parallel to the cutting board, but at a slight downward angle. Carefully saw the flesh away from the skin. Trim away any fins. The fins should be left behind when you skin the fish, but if any remain on the fillet, you should cut them off. At this point, you can also discard the rest of the fish's body as well, including the head and spine. Rinse the fish under cold water. Gently massage the meat with your fingers to get rid of any excess blood and guts. Cutting Fish for Sushi Choose fresh, sushi-grade fish skinned fillets. Look for fillets that are at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) thick. They should have a bright color and a fresh, salty smell. If they smell fishy or look dull/dark, do not buy them. Only buy the fillets if you plan to eat them the same day. If you are getting a frozen fish, make sure that it was frozen the same day it was caught. It is best to avoid getting frozen fish, however, as they usually are not that fresh. If you cannot get skinned, fish fillets, click here to learn how to fillet and skin a fish. Look for firm fish with bright eyes and scales. Fish with dull eyes and scales are not fresh. Great sushi fish include: tuna and salmon. Great places to get sushi-grade fish are fish markets and Japanese markets. Rinse the fillets. Plan on eating your sushi within four hours. If you don't plan on eating your sushi that soon, then stick the fish back into the fridge, on top of some ice. Remove bones with tweezers or pliers, if necessary. Most fish fillets will already have the bones removes, but you might still want to run your fingers over the flesh and check. If you feel something sharp, it is a bone. Pull it out using a pair of tweezers or pliers and discard it. Cut the fillets into blocks using a sharp, 8 to 10 inch (20.32 to 25.4 centimeters) long slicing knife. The easiest blocks to work with for sushi are 1 to 1\u00bd inches (2.54 to 3.81 centimeters) thick, 3 \u00bd inches (8.89 centimeters) wide, and 4 to 5 inches (10.16 to 12.7 centimeters) long. Work with a cold knife, hands, and cutting board. If necessary, run everything, including your hands, under cold water. Cut the blocks into slices. Cut across the grain at a downward, 45 degree angle. This will give you that nice, striped pattern. Keep the slices between 1/8 and \u00bc inches (0.32 to 0.64 centimeters) thick. Cut straight down. Don't use a sawing motion. Always hold the fish behind the knife. Never cut towards yourself or your hand. Use the pieces for nigiri or sashimi style sushi. If you want to make sushi rolls, consider using any leftover scraps. You can also trim your slices down so that they are narrower. Use the prettiest slices for nigiri and sashimi. The less pretty slices can go inside sushi rolls. Fish rolls provide an interesting and alternative to sushi for preparing fish.",
