Webcams \u2013 Motion-sensitive webcams start at $100 and can be remotely monitored on a Smartphone or computer. Twenty-four hour surveillance can help dissuade criminals from entering your home, and catch them if they do. Fake it even if you don\u2019t have an alarm. Studies show that most criminals move on as soon as they see an alarm sign. So even if you don\u2019t want to pay for an alarm system, be sure to invest in alarm signs. Put signs in the front and rear of your house, as well as stickers in any windows you are worried about. Adding fake motion sensors on your windows will make it even less likely that a burglar chooses your house. Protecting Your Home When You Are Away Make it look like you\u2019re still home. The key to protecting your home when you\u2019re away on work or vacation is to trick burglars into thinking you are still there. Follow the steps below to do so.

Saul Jaeger, MS\t\t\tPolice Captain, Mountain View Police Department\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: Leave your car in the driveway when you're not home, instead of the garage. That way, it will look like you're still home. However, be sure to take any valuables out of your car, since that does increase the risk it will be broken into. Install timers on lights and televisions. Timers cost $5 to $40. They can turn on and off your lights, or better yet your lights and television, at set times each morning and evening. Most burglars avoid occupied homes. If they think you are around, they\u2019ll look elsewhere. Don\u2019t let criminals hear your phone. Burglars sometimes call homes to be certain no one is there. If they here a phone go unanswered or an answering machine, they will know you are gone. Either turn down the volume on your ringer and answering machine or, better yet, have your calls forwarded. Leave blinds and drapes in their usual position. If you open and close them each day, consider using a timed, automatic curtain opener. If you are leaving your drapes open, be sure to move valuables so they are not in sight from the window. Take care of your mail and packages. If your newspapers and mail start to pile up, criminals will know you\u2019re not around. It is best to have a neighbor pick up your mail, packages, and newspaper for you. Seeing deliveries will make criminals think someone is home. You can also have your mail forward or held by the post office. Take care of your lawn and sidewalk. Arrange to have your lawn mowed in the summer, and your walk and driveway shoveled in the winter. Take out the trash. Have a neighbor use your trashcan and put it out on the curb. A house with no trash cans in front on collection day signals burglars that you aren\u2019t home. Tell your neighbors. Tell a dependable neighbor or two when you plan to be away, and ask them to keep an eye on your house.",
