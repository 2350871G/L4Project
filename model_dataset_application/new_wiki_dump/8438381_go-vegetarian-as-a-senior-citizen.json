          "description":"Protein gets more important as you age. While many people are concerned with protein intake with a vegetarian diet, it's easy to get enough protein if you make a point of eating protein rich foods throughout the day. Beans, soybeans, and peanuts are an excellent source of nutrients in addition to protein. Soy-based products can be used as a meat or dairy substitute. You can opt for soy milk as well as tofu."

Try drinking coconut water on occasion, as this is also high in potassium. Other sources of potassium include bananas, sweet potatoes, beets, yogurts, and tomato-based sauces."

          "headline":"Seek out alternative sources of calcium.",
          "description":"Calcium is important for bone health as you age. Most of the foods you would eat on a non-vegetarian diet will provide with adequate calcium. Go for low-fat or fat-free cheeses, yogurt, and milks. You can also drink juices and other beverages fortified with calcium. If you're going vegan rather than just vegetarian, go for calcium-rich or fortified foods, such as tofu, plant-based drinks fortified with calcium, and leafy greens. You may want to talk to your doctor about potentially taking a calcium supplement."

          "description":"Vitamin D may be a struggle to get if you're going for a vegetarian diet. Get your vitamin D through fortified drinks such as milk, fortified orange juice, or plant based milks such as soy or almond. Sunshine, however, is more important than diet for vitamin D, so make sure you go outdoors on occasion."

For example, eat a light breakfast such as a small bowl of yogurt with fruit. Then, have several healthy, vegetarian snacks leading up to a similarly light lunch."

It can also help with issues like constipation. In addition to eating nutrient-rich foods, you should keep up with your water intake on a vegetarian diet. Go for seven to eight glasses of water each day. If you drink other liquids, make sure to avoid very sugary, high-calorie liquids. Opt for diet sodas and juices without added sugar."

Your doctor will perform an exam and possibly do blood work to see if Omega 3 Fatty Acids are a good option for you. Do not start taking supplements without consulting a doctor. Supplements could potentially interfere with medication."
