          "description":"While not a scam in the strict sense, restaurant menus are sometimes designed to mislead customers who aren\u2019t paying close enough attention. This is especially prevalent in places with large, complex menus that offer lots of different options. Make a note of each item\u2019s description and price, how it\u2019s served and whether any additional costs may apply. For example, the price of a cheeseburger may seem fairly standard until you see that French fries have to be ordered separately. Specify the exact size of the item you\u2019re ordering in establishments that offer different portion sizes to avoid being upcharged without your awareness."

It\u2019s not uncommon to get incorrect change by mistake on occasion, but a desperate grifter can intentionally attempt to shortchange you or simply pocket the remainder of a cash payment. They\u2019re usually counting on the fact that you won\u2019t notice, or that you\u2019ll choose not to say anything even if you do in order to avoid confrontation. Always count your change to verify that you\u2019ve received the correct sum before leaving the table or counter. It isn\u2019t customary for a waiter to assume to their tip is included in the payment. If your waiter takes your money and doesn\u2019t return, flag them down or ask to speak to a manager."

It can be disconcertingly easy for your card info to get into the hands of a dishonest employee, who is then free to take it on a spending spree. If you have reason to believe that your card number has been stolen, cancel your card immediately and have your bank refund the fraudulent purchases.

Don\u2019t accept coupons that are being handed out on the street. These promotions are almost always a ruse designed to bring in customers.

Give the menu a thorough scan before you place your order, if there is one. Otherwise, use your best judgment in determining whether what you\u2019re being asked to pay is acceptable. See if you can overhear what the vendor is charging other customers. If your total comes out to something different (or if prices are just too steep in general), you may want to find someplace else to grab a bite. Overcharging patrons that don\u2019t speak the language is one particular scam that\u2019s run everyday in countries that receive heavy tourism. It\u2019s easy to pull off, as the customer will rarely take the time to make sure they\u2019ve paid the exact amount."

Never order something if the price is not clearly displayed beside it. In most cases, it will be safest to order items that you recognize or are able to identify.

If you don\u2019t remain vigilant, a night out on the town could turn into a forfeited paycheck. If possible, pay for each round of drinks individually, and use cash.

When buying water, always check to make sure that the container is properly sealed. Try to get drinking water from convenience stores or vending machines whenever possible. Examine the quality of bottled water before you drink it. Water sourced from public taps may be murky or slightly discolored, or have sediment floating around in it.
