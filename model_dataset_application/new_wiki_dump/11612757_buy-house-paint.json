          "description":"Oil-based paints are glossy, strong, and will last longer than latex paint. Their tough surface makes them resistant to stains and you can scrub them clean without damaging the paint. But they often require a primer and they take much longer to dry which makes applying the paint more time-consuming. Oil-based paints are also prone to mildew and mold. Bubbles can form when oil-based paint is applied, so extra care is needed when you\u2019re using it."

          "description":"Water-based paints, also known as latex paints don\u2019t require you to pre-treat your walls, their color doesn\u2019t fade over time, and they dry faster than oil-based paints. They\u2019re also strong and flexible enough to resist warping and cracking that can be caused by weather fluctuations, which makes them suitable for outdoor use. Latex paints also have lower levels of toxic emissions, so they won\u2019t pollute the environment as they degrade over time. If you live in humid areas, use latex paints for their resistance to mildew and bacterial growth. Latex paints are also cheaper than oil-based paints.Tip: If you\u2019re planning to cover a surface that already has oil-based paint on it, use latex paint! Oil-based paints are difficult to apply on top of another oil-based paint."

Exterior-grade paints are more weather-resistant and can withstand exposure to sunlight better. Check the paint can to make sure it\u2019s formulated for exterior use. The resin inside a paint designed for exterior use allows it to survive weather and temperature changes. Exterior-grade paints emit more toxic fumes, so they shouldn\u2019t be used in confined spaces or inside of your home."

Look on the side of the can or read the product description to make sure it\u2019s safe to use indoors. The binding resins added to interior-grade paint helps to protect against scuff marks and stains. Interior paints are less noxious and put off fewer fumes so they\u2019re safer to use indoors."
