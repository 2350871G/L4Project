          "description":"Do you want to photograph birds of prey, water birds, nesting birds or flying birds? Both the type and positioning of the bird can have a major impact on your photography success. Some birds are much easier to find and shoot than others. For instance, a wren or robin will be much easier to photograph than any type of raptor. Bird environments vary widely. Some of your decision will be determined by where you live or your ability to get somewhere by traveling in the time you have available. Seabirds, for example, require you to be near the ocean, while forest birds will require you to be near the forest. What is your own level of willingness to go where the birds are? If you're keen on the outdoors and love a good hike, you'll be more likely to head back country, climb, swim or whatever to get those rarer bird shots. On the other hand, if you're more of a park stroller, you may need to settle for the local, more common types of bird. Both are equally fine choices\u2013\u2013it is simply that you need to match your expectations to your preparedness to expend effort. Consider starting with a bird sanctuary. If there is a bird sanctuary or bird nature reserve near you, you're fairly much guaranteed to find birds as that's the focus of the place. As well as good amenities such as boardwalks, hides and seating, you'll also get lots of information on the birds and their habits too. Such a place is great for a beginner to practice bird photography."

          "description":"This means doing a lot of research unless you're already knowledgeable about the bird's habits and quirks. Consider doing some birdwatching first\u2013\u2013if you don't already have experience with that species, make a concerted effort to locate and watch them. Learn their habits and what they do before attempting to photograph them. It will put you at a distinct advantage to be personally aware of expected bird behaviors. Information that will make your photography more interesting and better directed includes: feeding habits, breeding, nesting, and migratory behaviors. Also consider season. Some birds look during some seasons than others, due to molting, over-wintering, etc. This knowledge will only be gleaned by doing your research first. Birdwatching beforehand also teaches you more than any guide can about the approachability of different species of birds. This will vary on the type of bird, the experience the birds have had with human interaction and where you are in the world. There is no one hard and fast rule for approaching birds, other than that being noisy and running at the birds will cause most birds to fly away (even pigeons), at least temporarily."

Is it flat, hilly or rough terrain? Can you access it with ease or do you need to hike in and out? Do birds use a cliff or other spot to take off over the ocean or land? Are there paths leading to this are that you can use? Can you ask the locals for information? If there is a bird colony in the area or it's a feeding/nesting/take-off area, the locals will know a lot more than any static guidebook. Ask at the local store, recreation center or information center to begin with, and call any local birdwatching clubs too."

These are camouflaged hideaway shelters that permit birdwatching without disturbing the birds. They can be very useful for taking candid shots of birds that are happily unaware of your presence. Plotting the places on a sketch map will come in handy for future photographic expeditions too. You can make notations on the map while on your first expedition to update or confirm data already input. Slip the sketch map into a plastic cover to protect it from the elements and mud."

For pond, stream, swamp, etc., photography, get some decent boots, waders, gaiters, etc. For searing heat environments, wear a good hat with a wide brim, neck cover and an elastic band to keep it in place. If the brim can be turned to one side or folded back, this might be useful to prevent shading your photos on occasion. For cold weather shooting, rug up appropriately and get gloves that are warm but still allow you to move the camera apparatus. Pack adequate food, drink and snacks.

And it needs to be a DSLR\u2013\u2013bird photography requires a good quality camera with a fast shutter speed. What sort of lenses do you have? Ken Rockwell recommends cheap, ordinary lenses for pet birds, and then a skip up to practical long lenses in the US$1000-1600 range for wild bird photography for amateurs. For the more serious, you can dabble in very expensive lenses but wait until you know that this is going to really be your hobby before investing at the high end.

(Note that many cameras are good at tracking birds against a bland sky, not so good when a complex background comes into play; see How to photograph sports or How to photograph motor racing for tips on dealing with movement.)
