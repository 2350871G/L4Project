Soak it in cool water or wash it according to its care instructions immediately to prevent staining. Using a liquid-proof pillowcase or pillow protector will help keep your memory foam pillow clean. Since washing it is not as simple as throwing it in a machine, stain prevention will save you the hassle of more frequent cleanings."

If you have trouble getting out the spill out, squirt a drop or two of mild, alcohol-free dish soap onto the damp cloth and use it to blot the spill area. Hot water causes stains to set, so cool water is your best option. Have patience and keep gently blotting instead of scrubbing hard. Use as little moisture as possible to clean the spill, as water can damage memory foam."

Once you\u2019ve removed as much dampness as possible using the towel, let the pillow air dry completely before replacing the pillowcase. You can use a blow dryer to quicken the drying process, but be sure it is on a cool setting. Avoid using a dryer or you\u2019ll risk melting a memory foam pillow."
