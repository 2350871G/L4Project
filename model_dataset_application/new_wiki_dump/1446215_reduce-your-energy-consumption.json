Lower your thermostat to between 64 and 68 \u00b0F (18 and 20 \u00b0C) in the winter.

Always clean the lint out of the filter of the dryer after each use, and remember to dry heavy and light fabrics separately. Use the highest spin cycle on your washing machine, as the high spin speeds remove more moisture and reduce the time needed to dry clothing.
