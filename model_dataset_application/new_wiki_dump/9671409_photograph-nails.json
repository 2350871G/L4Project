          "description":"If dirty hands are in the picture, the dirt is going to be the main focus instead of the nails. Use a clean cloth to clear away any dust or dirt on the nails. If you have dirt on your hands, rinse them with soap and water before drying them."

          "description":"To avoid taking pictures of dry hands that will take away from the focus of the nails, use a soothing lotion to moisturize the hands. Apply the lotion a few minutes before taking the photograph so that the lotion has some time to soak into the hands."

          "headline":"Aim for even, natural lighting in your photos.",
          "description":"It\u2019s best to photograph nails during the day when there\u2019s lots of natural sunlight. If possible, photograph nails next to a window where you can play around with the best lighting by positioning the hands to catch different angles of light. A workspace lamp works too, just make sure the light doesn\u2019t alter the appearance of the nail color. If you\u2019re using a lamp, try to get the light as close to the nails as possible for the best shine."

          "headline":"Avoid shadows from your camera or cell phone.",
          "description":"Since your camera or phone will be positioned above the nails, it's going to cast a shadow depending on where your light source is coming from. Make sure you don't get the shadow in your photo. If necessary, try out different angles so that your camera is able to capture a shadow-free picture."

          "description":"You want to photograph nails on a very simple background that won\u2019t be distracting to the viewer. Choose a clean, white background, or you could opt for a colored background that highlights the nail color. Just make sure that the background isn\u2019t taking away from the main focus of the picture \u2014 the nails!"

When posing the hands, bend the fingers slightly so that the light reflects off of the nails, and keep the fingers close together to include more detail in the camera frame. For pose inspiration, check Instagram to find nail pictures you like, and then try to copy the hand poses."

You can also place the hands on top of one another while keeping each hand's fingers pressed together. This way, your nails will be facing different directions, allowing the light to reflect off of them differently as well."

Test out using different objects in your photos, either by having the hands hold the object or using the object as a background."

A classic diamond or gold ring can take your photo to a whole new level. You can also put unique rings on the hands, including 2-finger rings, rings resembling a flower or animal, or put different rings on multiple fingers."

For example, to show off a creative design such as a flower pattern, you can have the fingers holding a flower that resembles the design on the nails. If the nails are painted to resemble piano keys, position the hand on a piano keyboard to take the picture."

If you\u2019re using a regular camera and not a cell phone, change the setting to macro.
