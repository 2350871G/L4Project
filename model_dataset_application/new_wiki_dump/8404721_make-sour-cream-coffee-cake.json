Baking and Glazing the Coffee Cake Bake the cake for half an hour. Place the pan in the preheated oven.

If you want the icing to have a spreadable, frosting-like consistency, you can add a little more powdered sugar to thicken it up. Add the icing to the cake and serve. When the icing is mixed, drizzle or spread it over the top of the coffee cake. Cut it into pieces, and place on plates to serve. Store the cake covered and at room temperature. It will keep for up to 3 days. Finished. ",
