          "description":"The most important component of your cat\u2019s evacuation kit is a supply of food and water. When determining the amount of food and water your cat will need, estimate about 14 quarts of water (448 ounces), plus your cat\u2019s usual daily food intake multiplied by 14. Don\u2019t forget to include extra food and water dishes. Having the food and water won\u2019t help your cat if they have no way to consume it! If your cat\u2019s food usually comes in metal containers, don\u2019t forget a can opener."

          "description":"Your cat might not normally wear a harness, collar, or leash, but these are good things to include in your evacuation kit. Your cat may get nervous in new or unfamiliar places and situations created by an emergency, and these supplies can help keep your cat restrained. If your cat becomes very panicked in unfamiliar situations, you might want to consider including a pair of leather gloves with these supplies to protect your hands from scratches."

          "description":"If you don\u2019t already have a carrier for your cat, you should get one to include with your cat\u2019s evacuation kit. The carrier should have your name, cat\u2019s name and description, and your phone number and address listed on it. Include an alternate phone number in case you\u2019re not at home and someone finds your cat and needs to contact you. You should also include your cat\u2019s insurance policy number and microchip or tattoo ID if applicable."

          "headline":"Make a copy of your cat\u2019s records.",

You can also include a current picture of your cat, which will help identify you as the cat's owner if someone else finds it."

          "headline":"Put aside extras of your cat\u2019s medications.",
          "description":"You should also put aside a two-week supply of any medications that your cat takes. You can also include one dose of preventative heart worm medication. This is especially important since in the event of an emergency, your cat might be around other animals or in an unfamiliar place where contracting heart worm is more likely. If your cat\u2019s medications need to be refrigerated, include a few chemical ice packs in your kit. Cracking these packs when they\u2019re ready for use will give you an ice pack without the need to keep anything frozen."

Including some familiar toys, a blanket, and grooming supplies like a brush and nail clippers can help keep your cat comfortable in an emergency. A pheromone spray like Feliway can also contribute to your cat\u2019s comfort. Spraying it on your cat\u2019s toys and blanket, and in the areas where they\u2019re staying during the emergency, sends your cat a signal that they are in a safe place."

You can create your own by purchasing a small litter pan and scoop and including paper towel, garbage bags and a disinfectant to keep your cat\u2019s litter box clean during an emergency. Don\u2019t forget the actual litter, either."
