After about 20 times of peeling, you should end up with a layer of graphite that is only 1 atom thick. This is graphene.

If you used the same piece of tape folded on top of itself multiple times, you will notice that some spots will be darker and some will be lighter. The lighter spots are the thinnest layers and the lightest spot is the graphene. If you used fresh pieces of tape to peel layers each time, use your final piece of tape (about the 20th piece) to place under the microscope."

In general, if the graphene particles are too big (still graphite), they will sink to the bottom of the blender; if they are smaller, they will float to the top.
