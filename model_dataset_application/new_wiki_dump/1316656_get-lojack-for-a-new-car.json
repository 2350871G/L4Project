A list of counties within states where LoJack coverage is available is given at http://www.lojack.com/Buy-LoJack-Products/Check-Coverage, and is also available by calling 1-800-456-5225 (1-800-4-LoJack).

      "description":"The basic LoJack Stolen Vehicle Recovery System is the wireless radio transponder described above, which LoJack's certified technicians install somewhere in your vehicle. For an additional fee, LoJack offers an Early Warning Recovery System that includes a key pass you carry with you when driving and notifies you by phone, cell phone, e-mail, text message, or pager if your car has been moved without your permission. (You choose the methods you want to be contacted by when you register your LoJack.) LoJack makes it a practice not to disclose where in the car the LoJack unit is installed, not even to the vehicle owner. Although you can witness the installation, your recovery warranty may be voided if you do."
