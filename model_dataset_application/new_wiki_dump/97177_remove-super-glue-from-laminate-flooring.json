Acetone is the main ingredient in most nail polish removers. Never keep your acetone in a styrofoam or plastic cup. It will dissolve the cup. If you use nail polish remover, make sure it does indeed have acetone. Some companies are trying to use other substances as acetone weakens the bonds for acrylic nails."
