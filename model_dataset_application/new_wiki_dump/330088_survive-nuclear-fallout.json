The flash from a nuclear explosion is blinding, so do not look at or face the explosion if you\u2019re near the blast site. If you\u2019re in a vehicle, pull off the road, come to a stop, duck down, and cover your head and face."

For instance, if the cloud is approaching from the north, go east or west.Safety tip: Evacuate only if there\u2019s an obvious debris cloud or if instructed by authorities. If you're not within the immediate vicinity of the blast, the safest place to be is usually indoors. Buildings, brick and concrete structures in particular, can block significant amounts of harmful radiation."

          "description":"Shelter in place if you haven\u2019t been instructed to evacuate. Preferably, head to the basement of a solid brick or concrete building. If you know the direction of the prevailing winds, take shelter on the opposite side of the structure away from doors and windows. For instance, if winds in your area usually blow from northwest to southeast, head to the southeast corner of the building. Try to find the nearest brick or concrete building within 10 minutes. If no brick or concrete building is available, seek shelter in a structure with a basement. If that\u2019s not possible, head to a windowless interior room."

Close and lock all doors and windows, and shut your fireplace\u2019s dampers, if you have one. If you have time and duct tape is handy, use it to seal cracks around doors and windows. Sealing the building can reduce your shelter\u2019s exposure to radioactive fallout. Depending on your distance from the blast site, you may have 10 minutes or more to take shelter and seal the building. If you have a battery-operated or hand-cranked radio, follow your local authorities' instructions on sheltering in place."

Quarantining outer layers of clothing can remove up to 90% of radioactive contamination."

          "description":"If you have access to a shower, rinse off with warm water and gently wash yourself with soap. Otherwise, wash with any available water source. Additionally, wipe your eyelids, eyelashes, and ears and blow your nose to remove radioactive residue. Don\u2019t scrub hard, as damaging your skin could allow radioactive particles to enter your body. If you have an open wound, cover it with a bandage before washing yourself to keep radioactive particles from entering it. Tap water is unsuitable to drink, but you can use it to decontaminate yourself. Any radioactive material in tap water is diluted, so it's safe to use for bathing. Wash your hair with shampoo, but don\u2019t use conditioner, which will make radioactive particles stick to your hair and body.Wash your pets, too: If any of your pets were outside and potentially exposed to radiation, wash them with soap and warm water. If possible, wear gloves and cover your face with a mask, cloth, or towel when decontaminating your pets or other people, such as your kids."

Consume only packaged products that were stored inside, and store food and water in shielded containers. Even if power is off, the refrigerator should help shield food and water from radiation exposure. Wash your hands with soap and warm water before eating and drinking. It\u2019s wise to have a 3-day emergency supply of non-perishable food and water at all times in the event of a disaster situation."

After about 8 hours, radioactivity levels will drop by about 90%; stay in the basement or an interior, windowless room during that time. You may need to stay inside for at least 24 to 48 hours. Do not go outside until the authorities have given the clear. Listen for instructions on your battery-operated or hand-cranked radio, if you have one. If not, see if you can access emergency information with another electronic device. When it's safe to do so, emergency responders may also enter the building searching for survivors."

Wrap food scraps in plastic or foil, and place the wrapped scraps in a sealed container. If toilets aren't in operation and you're unable to leave your home, make a latrine using a bucket lined with a thick plastic bag. Tie the bag tightly after using it, and dispose of it in a trash receptacle that seals tightly. Be sure to line the trash receptacle with a heavy-duty plastic bag. Keep waste receptacles away from food, water, and living areas. If you have rubbing alcohol on hand, use it to disinfect your hands. To sanitize surfaces, use a diluted bleach solution."

If phone lines are down or if emergency services can't respond, see if your neighbors can help or have the medication you require on hand. Cover your face with a clean cloth, wear long sleeves and pants, and decontaminate yourself after seeking help from your neighbors. As a last resort, and only in life-threatening scenarios, go to the nearest medical facility. Once inside your vehicle, keep the windows up, stay alert, and do your best to steer clear of debris and damaged roadways."
