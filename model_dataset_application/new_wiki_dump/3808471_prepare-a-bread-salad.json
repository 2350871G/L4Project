When you're short for time, lay the cubes on a baking sheet and bake them in an oven preheated to 300 F (149 C) for 15 to 20 minutes. You want the bread toasted on the outside but still soft on the inside. Flip the bread cubes twice during the baking process. The best bread for panzanella is a loaf that has a thick and crunchy crust, such as French, Italian, baguette, or an artisan sourdough loaf. Otherwise, the bread will become soggy in the salad. Panzanella is a dish that was created to use up stale and dried up bread ends, which is why the bread has to be dried before you can use it in the dish."
