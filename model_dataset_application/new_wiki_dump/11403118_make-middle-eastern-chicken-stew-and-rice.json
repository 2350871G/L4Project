  "text":" Cooking the Chicken Stew Preheat the pan to medium heat. Drizzle the olive oil over the pan and wait several minutes until it warms up. Add the prepared saffron, if desired. Fry the chicken until golden brown. Once the oil is warm, add the chicken thighs and fry them on both sides, each side for about 5-7 minutes. Season over the salt and pepper while the chicken is cooking. Remove the chicken from the heat.  Slice and fry the onion. Slice the onion in medium-sized pieces and place the onion in the already-oiled, warm pan to let it soften. Stir in the turmeric powder and then add the tomato paste once the onion has softened. The oil that you cooked the chicken is already in the pan and can be used for this step. Wait until the tomato paste has fried. Cooking the tomato paste will help it release its color and give it more flavor. After three to four minutes, the color of the paste will change and become darker. Add the fried chicken to the onion and tomato paste mixture. Season over the bay leaf, rosemary, salt, and black pepper. After adding all the spices, pour in the warm water. Stir for several seconds until the texture turns into stew. Ensure that all the spices are combined in with the water and tomato paste. Cook the stew on low-medium heat for one hour. Place the lid on top of the pan and allow it to cook on medium-low heat. Depending on the type of pan used, the temperature should rise and cause the water to reduce over time. Check the stew after thirty minutes to see if the heat is not too high and that you have a good amount of water in your stew. If needed, add more water when necessary. Cooking the Basmati Rice Rinse and wash the rice in cold water. Washing the rice will remove any dirt and excess starch so that your rice will become fluffy and will help prevent it from being sticky. Pour the rice in cold water and allow it to boil. After washing the rice, add four cups of cold water. Sprinkle over the salt and olive oil. Let the rice cook partially over medium heat until you notice the water and rice begin to boil. Cooking time depends on the rice that you use. For example, Basmati rice will take approximately 10 minutes to cook halfway. Strain the half-cooked rice and lightly wash with cold water.  Grate the potatoes and soak in cold water. Allow the grated potatoes to soak in cold water for several minutes to help remove any excess starch from the potatoes. Remove the potatoes from the water. Sprinkle over the spices and strain the potato and add salt and saffron to the potato for flavor. Leave some saffron for final food presentation. If you don\u2019t have saffron, add turmeric instead.
