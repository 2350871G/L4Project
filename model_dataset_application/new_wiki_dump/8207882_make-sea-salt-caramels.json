Leave the parchment paper hanging over the sides by at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) so that you can pull it out later. Lightly grease the parchment paper, then set the baking pan aside."

          "description":"Cut the butter into 8 cubes and put it into a microwave-safe bowl. Put the heavy cream over it. Put the bowl into the microwave, and heat it for 1 to 2 minutes in the microwave. Once the butter has melted and the heavy cream turned hot, give the mixture a stir, then set it aside. Make sure that the heavy cream or heavy whipping cream that you are using has at least 36 to 40% butterfat content. Do not use plain whipping cream. That has only 30% butterfat content, and that is not enough to make successful caramels. If you don't own a microwave, you can heat the butter and the heavy cream in a little saucepan over the stove. Don't let it come to a boil, however!"

The cleaner you keep your saucepan, the less crystallization will occur, and the smoother your caramel will turn out.
