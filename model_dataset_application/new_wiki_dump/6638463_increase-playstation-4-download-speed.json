          "headline":"Check the terms of your Internet contract.",
          "description":"The problem may be with your Internet service, not the console itself; for example, if you aren't approved for download speeds above a certain capacity (e.g., 25 Mbps), your downloads may not get any faster than they already are. Keep in mind that Internet speed is often measured in megabits per second, not megabytes per second. There are eight megabits in a megabyte, so a 25 Mbps connection is only allowing you to download ~3 megabytes per second. Upgrading your plan or switching to a better Internet Service Provider will most likely fix any capacity problems."

You'll need an Ethernet cable to do so. One end of your Ethernet cable should plug into the square port in the back of your PS4 while the other plugs into a similar port marked \"Internet\" on your modem or router.
