A little variation makes it interesting. How much hair falls out of the braid, and how far it goes from the rest, will depend on the looseness of the braid. Braids get looser over time, so if the person has been wearing the braid for a while, it will become messier. Tip: Use the elbow and wrist to keep your strokes loose. Stay loose and relaxed. There's no need to be precise; a little chaos is a good thing when it comes to drawing hair."
