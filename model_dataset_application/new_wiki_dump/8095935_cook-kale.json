You can either tear it out or carefully use a sharp knife to slice the stem away. Tear or chop the kale into bite-sized pieces. Discard the stems or save them for another recipe. You can dry the kale if it makes it easier for you to tear or chop."

Set the steamer basket into your saucepan and cover the pot with the tight-fitting lid. Let the kale steam over medium-high heat for 5 to 10 minutes. Stir it occasionally so it steams evenly. You can taste the kale and season it with a vinegar or squeeze of lemon juice. For easy removal, just use tongs to scoop the kale out of the steamer basket. This will also help any water drip off of the kale."
