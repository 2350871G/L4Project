Since epoxy is a semitransparent or colorless material, a pigment is used to give it its final color. Pre-pigmented packages are the best bet for home installers, but separate pigments can be purchased for your project if you wish to do so. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1c\\/Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-4Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-4Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1c\\/Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-4Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-4Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nTexturing materials. It may be desirable to texture the floor with an aggregate material so the finish is not too slippery. Numerous materials are used for this purpose, from sandblasting sand to PVC plastic granules, giving different textures and degrees of traction. When in doubt, visit a paint retailer and look at samples of the products they offer, and read the manufacturer's literature for recommended products and procedures. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1b\\/Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-4Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-4Bullet4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1b\\/Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-4Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-4Bullet4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Calculate the amount of material required to do your project. Epoxies do not cover as much surface area as other coatings and paints, so check the application (or coverage)rate for the product you choose. Basically, for a 5 to 6 mil application rate, one gallon of combined material will cover 200 square feet, or a small, one car garage. Because you will want a seamless, one-step application of each coat, be sure to allow for waste and purchase significantly more than you will need.#Install the coating. The rest is install the coatings per the manufacturers instructions. The basic steps will be these:Mix the pigment, if used, with the resin in a clean metal container with twice the capacity of the total amount you will use for each application. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b5\\/Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b5\\/Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nAdd the hardener (catalyst) and mix again. Thorough mixing is essential for best results, so consider using a paint mixing paddle in a power drill, but avoid mixing at a speed so high it creates bubbles in the material. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/10\\/Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/10\\/Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nUsing a \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) nap roller on an extension handle, apply the material to the floor. Begin at a back corner, so you can work your way toward the exit as you roll, and overlap each roller path by one half its width with each successive roll. Keep plenty of material in the roller, and if it begins tacking, dip it again in your mixing bucket. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e1\\/Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e1\\/Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nWork the roller as quickly as possible, as the epoxy has a short working time. Most epoxies, mixed according to manufacturer's directions, must be used in less than one hour, excessive hardener will reduce the working time considerably. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e7\\/Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e7\\/Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Put-an-Epoxy-Coating-on-a-Garage-Floor-Step-6Bullet4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Design it, if desired. If you wish to add paint chips, you should paint a measly 6'x6' section at a time and put the chips afterward. When you're placing them, make sure that you toss them in the air so that they will fall back to your fresh paint. You'll have a more random spread if you do this compared to throwing them directly on the paint. Finishing Up Dispose of your used materials. Dispose of your paint roller cover when you have finished applying a complete coat over the entire garage floor. The solvents used for epoxy cleanup are dangerous, and expensive, so cleaning your tools is simply not practicable. Allow the epoxy to cure completely. Again, read and follow the manufacturer's directions for the product you select, as this time may vary significantly. Observe the re-coat times carefully. It's best that you put an extra coating to your floor. It will have a more glossy shine that can lock in the chips and ensuring the your floor will last longer. Remember, re-coating after waiting too long can be just as bad as not waiting long enough.",
