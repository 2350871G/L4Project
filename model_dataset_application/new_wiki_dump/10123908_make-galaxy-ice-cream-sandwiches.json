  "text":" Making the Ice Cream Sandwiches Cover a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with plastic wrap. Line a little extra than needed so the plastic wrap can hang over the edges. Break the graham crackers in half and lay them on the baking dish. Arrange them neatly in order for them to fully cover the baking dish. Set the extra graham crackers aside for later use. In a large bowl, beat the condensed milk, cream cheese, and vanilla extract. Mix well with an electric mixer until well-combined and smooth. Pour in the heavy cream and blend once more. Beat until the mixture is fluffy and light. Separate the mixture into four small bowls and add the food coloring. Add a few drops of the black, pink, blue, and purple food coloring separately to color every creamed mixture. Mix well until the color is bright and vibrant. Scoop spoonfuls of each colored mixture onto the baking dish. Add the scoopfuls all over the graham cracker bottom. Slowly and carefully smooth out the layer with a rubber spatula. Swirl the colors together. Using a kebab stick or knife, gently swirl the colors together. Carefully smooth out the layer with a rubber spatula. Add the remaining graham crackers on top.  Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap.  Freeze the ice cream layer until solid. Allow it to freeze for at least four hours; however, freezing them overnight is preferred for the best results. Decorating and Serving Remove the baking dish from the freezer.  Cover a baking sheet with waxed paper.  Slice the ice cream layer to create ice cream sandwiches. Take off the plastic warp from the baking dish. Using a warm, sharp knife, cut out square-sized ice cream sandwiches. Place the sandwiches on the baking sheet. Freeze the ice cream sandwiches once more for about twenty minutes.  Pour the sprinkles in a medium-sized bowl. Set aside. Microwave the candy melts in a microwave-safe bowl. Melt the candy melts with the oil and microwave until fully melted, mixing every few seconds with a spoon. Remove the sandwiches from the freezer and decorate. Dip the ice cream sandwiches into the melted candy melts halfway and then immediately roll them into the sprinkles. Repeat until all the sandwiches are decorated. Leave them on the baking sheet covered with waxed paper. Chill the ice cream sandwiches in the freezer one last time. Allow them to freeze until the dipped candy melts harden and set. Serve.
