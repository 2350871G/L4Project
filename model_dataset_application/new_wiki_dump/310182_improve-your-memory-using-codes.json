A dozen eggs is your first item. Bun, you remember is your first word. Think of taking a bun in your hand and banging it down on a carton of eggs until every egg is broken. Or think of taking an egg, shell and all, and putting it between two buns and biting into this egg sandwich! A box of salt is your next item. Shoe is your next key word. Think of pouring a box of salt into a shoe. Think of scooping mounds of salt off the ground with your shoe. Think of salting your shoe and eating it! Flea is next, for a box of rice. Think about a flea using a grain of rice like a weightlifter. Half a dozen bananas. Key word-Door. Think of six doors shaped exactly like big bananas. Think of peeling the doors. Think of throwing bananas against the door until they are squashed. Loaf of bread. Key word-Hive. Think of a bee hive made of a loaf of bread, with bees swarming around it. A grapefruit. Key word-Sticks. Think of taking pointed sticks and driving them through a grapefruit-and imagine the grapefruit juice squirting in your eyes. Shoelaces. Key word-Heaven. Think of angels dropping shoelaces out of the sky. Think of an angel tying her shoelace and breaking it. Two bars of Ivory Soap. Key word-Gate. Think of an iron spike gate with two bars of soap stuck on the spikes. Think of making soap from an elephants tusk-of ivory. Maple syrup. Key word-Pine. Think of a huge vat of syrup being poured over a pine tree. Think of dipping a pine tree in maple syrup and stirring it. Box of pretzels. Key word-Hen. Think of a hen laying a pretzel-shaped egg. Think of pretzels all over the ground, with hens running over them and crumbling them."

Suppose you meet a Mr. Silverman. You look him over and note-among other things-that he walks very straight. That his hair is gray-or silver. Imagine yourself pouring a vat of liquid silver over his head so that it runs down all over him, hardens, and stops him in his tracks. You've just made him a silver man. Picture him that way. Or how about a Mrs. Saltinstall? You notice that she smiles a lot and has beautiful white teeth. Imagine her gargling with salt water. Imagine her getting to big a mouthful of salt, sputtering, and running off to her car. She jumps in it and it stalls. These two sounds-salt-stall-or just one of them, will recall her name to you the next time you see her. How about a Mr. Franklin? Try this name yourself first, then see if some of your associations are the same as mine, even though they don't have to be the same. Imagine Mr. Franklin flying a kite-the way Ben Franklin did. Mr. Franklin mentioned that he likes to eat-so I imagined him eating a three-foot long Frank with lint all over it. (Don't worry about calling him Mr. Hot Dog the next time you meet him.) Since Mr. Franklin says what's on his mind-I knew that he was frank-or outspoken. We'll try one more-a Mrs. Mussel. Mussel sounds like muscle. Mrs. Mussel is skinny, about ninety pounds. That's what stays in your mind after you've looked her over. You imagine her flexing her right arm muscle and you're amazed that the muscle is huge-bigger than all the rest of her.

  "text":" One to Ten Memory Code This method gives a code word to each number, 1 - 10, each word rhyming with the number One - Bun Two - Shoe Three - Flea Four - Door Five - Hive Six - Sticks Seven - Heaven Eight - Gate Nine - Pine Ten - Hen Remember the Code words. Repeat each combination several times, to make sure you know the keyword for each. Say \"One is Bun, Two is Shoe, Three is Flea,\" and so on.
