      "description":"Add the sugar, flour and a little of the milk into the egg yolks and mix well with your whisk. Next, slice the vanilla pod horizontally, split it open and scrape out the pulp with your knife. Place both the pulp and bean into the saucepan and pour in the remaining milk."

Pour the whole yolk mixture back into the pan of milk. Stir continuously until it thickens into a custard like consistency then remove from the heat. Discard the vanilla pod, add the butter and whisk until combined. Pour the liquid into a bowl and cover it with the film. Press the film down into the cream with your fingers - this stops a crust forming - and place into the fridge until chilled."
