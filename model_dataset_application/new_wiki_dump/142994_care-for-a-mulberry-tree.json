When acquiring a mulberry tree for fruit, choose a cultivar that is strong, self-pollinating, and has seedless fruits. There are also fruitless and weeping cultivars available for purchase if you are not interested in a fruit-bearing tree. Search for hardy and lush cultivars for planting. The Morus alba (white mulberry) and Morus rubra (red mulberry) hybrids (such as the Downing and Illinois Everbearing) are known for their large, sweet, fruit and hardiness."

          "description":"Mulberry trees will grow on many types of soil as long as a good drainage system is provided. Ensure they are not in an area where flooding is common as they do not tolerate being engulfed in water. When possible, well-drained, deep soils are preferred. Opt for slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.5 to 6.5. Soils of moderate alkalinity are able to be tolerated. If you are unsure of the pH of your soil, take a sample to the Cooperative Extension Agency in your county."

          "description":"Mulberry trees are able to survive in drought and salty conditions so they are typically good for urban or coastal planting. They thrive in climates that see seasonal temperature changes including sunny summers and frosty winters. The fruit that falls from trees may cause dark stains so avoid planting near walkways or driveways as the branches can be very weak. Chickens, turkeys and pigs enjoy mulberries so you can always choose to plant a mulberry tree where it will overhang and offer your animals a treat.

You should not plant when the ground is frozen, when daytime temperatures are below  32\u00baF or above 90\u00baF, or when there\u2019s extreme weather such as blizzards or torrential rain."

There should also be 25\u201330 feet (7.6\u20139.1 m) between each tree, though some varieties will be fine with 15 feet (4.6 m). Mix the soil that has been set aside with aged mushroom compost, aged manure, or rotted pine bark (half and half). Remove the plant from the pot, loosen the root, and place it in the hole. Fill the hole with the soil mixture previously set aside, and water it to allow the roots to settle. Avoid burying the root too deeply by making sure the top most roots are positioned at the soil line. Avoid adding fertilizer to the planting hole unless it is during an appropriate fertilization time. Fertilization is based on the age of the tree and can occur anywhere from February to August."

          "description":"Your fertilizer should contain iron, zinc, manganese, magnesium, molybdenum, copper and boron. An NPK value of 10-10-10 is good. When applying the fertilizer, spread evenly under the canopy of the tree by watering or raking into the soil. Avoid spreading fertilizer within the 5-inch area around the trunk of the tree. The time and frequency of adding fertilizer depends on the tree\u2019s age. Most mulberry trees thrive with little to no fertilization. Fertilizing once per year should be fine. Avoid fertilizing more than twice a year and begin in March but no later than July. Fertilizing after August will result in freeze damage."

          "description":"Water your mulberry tree twice a week if it is surrounded by light soils, and water once a week if planted on clay soil. It should take you 40-50 minutes to ensure that the root system is completely soaked. Each week, your tree should receive at least 1 inch of water, especially during extremely dry periods. You don\u2019t need to manually water your tree if you receive at least 1 inch of rain in your area. Fruit may fall from the tree prematurely if it doesn\u2019t receive ample water. The best way to avoid dry spells is to let your garden hose slowly trickle to allow the water to penetrate the roots instead of running off."

Removal of dead, diseased or crossed branches should be done in winter when the tree is dormant. Avoid pruning in mid-summer to allow the tree to set for the upcoming year\u2019s fruit buds. Cuts should follow the shape of the tree and should never be more than 2 inches in diameter. You should need no more than 5 cuts to prune a healthy mulberry tree. Cuts over 2 inches in diameter can lead to bleeding, from which your tree is not likely to heal. They also leave your tree vulnerable to certain diseases and fungi."

Do not harvest before May or your fruit may not be fully ripened. Your berries are ripe when they are large, sweet and black. Taste one to be sure. When placing your fruit in a container, avoid layering too many or the berries at the bottom of the container will be crushed. Your unwashed harvest can be stored for several days in a covered container in the refrigerator. Your harvest can also be kept for several month by washing the berries, patting them dry, and placing them in freezer bags."

There\u2019s no chemical control for sooty canker disease, so always make sure to prune dead branches as soon as you recognize them to avoid spreading the disease. Burn the diseased branches, too.
