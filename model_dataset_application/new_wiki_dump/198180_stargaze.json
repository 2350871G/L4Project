          "headline":"Find somewhere away from bright lights.",
          "description":"It is easiest to see stars if you\u2019re away from large urban areas that produce a lot of artificial light at night. This reduces visibility of the night sky, making it harder to see stars. The further you get away from urban lights, the more stars you\u2019ll be able to see, so try heading to rural areas or even parks or nature preserves."
        },

          "headline":"Stargaze when there\u2019s a new moon.",
          "description":"The darker the sky is, the more stars become visible. At night, the size of the moon has a large effect on how bright or dark the sky. If you go stargazing when the moon is at its smallest, you will have a better view of the stars. You can look up the phases of the moon online on various astronomical websites. Some weather forecasts will also include information about the moon."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Go to a place with high elevation.",
          "description":"Just as with landscapes on Earth, views of the stars become better the higher up you go. Being at a high elevation not only makes you relatively closer to the sky but also puts you above trees and other things that can block your view. Astronomers often place their observatories on mountains for these reasons. If you can\u2019t make it out of a city, though, you can try stargazing from the top of a building. You can research state and national parks to find public spaces with high elevations. If you\u2019re interested, you can often camp at the park you stargaze from."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Go stargazing in the winter for the best views.",
          "description":"Views of the night sky are usually best in the winter for several reasons. There is less daylight in the winter, so the sky gets darker at night and stays that way for longer. Also the leaves have fallen off of most trees, so there tend to be more places to find an unobstructed view. If you stargaze in the winter, though, you will want to make sure to bring heavy clothing and any other equipment you might need to keep yourself warm and safe."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pay attention to weather forecasts.",
          "description":"When planning a stargazing outing, you want to make sure you have good, clear weather. Cloudy skies will severely limit your ability to see stars. Additionally, stargazing requires spending long stretches of time outdoors, so you should avoid having to stand in the rain."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Research upcoming astronomical events.",
          "description":"The night sky always has interesting things to see, but there are sometimes occurrences that make stargazing particularly interesting. Comets or meteor showers, for instance, can be especially fun to watch. If you want to see something like that while stargazing, you can research upcoming astronomical events online. Astronomers often know what you will be able to see on a certain night well in advance. A good place to start looking for this information is the NASA website, which has a useful Sky Events Calendar. You can find that calendar here: https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SKYCAL/SKYCAL.html"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Research campsites.",
          "description":"To try finding place that has high elevation and relatively little light pollution, you can begin by searching campsites in state or national parks. Some parks have particularly great areas for stargazing, and many are free or inexpensive to enter. Many state and national parks have informative websites that let you know what kinds of activities you can do there. If a website says nothing about stargazing, however, you can always call and ask to speak with a park ranger, who should be able to answer your questions.."

Especially if you\u2019re just looking to try stargazing, binoculars can be a simpler and more affordable option than getting a telescope. There are many different brands and types of binoculars that you can research to choose the best ones for your needs."

Telescopes have been used by astronomers for centuries, and they offer better clearer views of stars than any other device. There are many different telescopes on the market, but you will probably only need highly advanced models if you\u2019re especially serious about stargazing. If you are looking to buy a telescope, keep in mind that some of the most important factors are magnification power, portability, type, and price."

Ideally, you should have a chair that enables you to use your telescope comfortably. You don\u2019t want to put undue strain on your neck or back by hunching over your telescope. If you\u2019re going with several people, you can also spread a blanket on the ground so multiple people can sit at once."

No matter the season, it makes sense to bring several layers along. That way you will always be able to adjust how many warm clothes you\u2019re wearing to make yourself as comfortable as possible. If you\u2019re going in the winter, you will especially want to make sure you have a proper coat, warm socks, and other warm layers, like sweaters, sweatshirts, and scarves."

You do not want to ruin your stargazing experience by becoming dehydrated. If you\u2019re going in the winter, you may also want to bring a thermos so you can have warm liquids, like hot tea or soup, on hand."

This will give you something besides the ground to spread out your stuff on. A table can be especially useful for spreading out any stargazing guides you might bring."

Stargazers often use these markers to figure out what part of the sky they\u2019re looking at. From these touchstones, you can often easily identify other stars and constellations.

One of the most recognizable of these in the northern hemisphere is the Big Dipper, which looks like a spoon or a bowl with a handle. Constellations are not only beautiful to look at, they can also help you to identify individual stars and orient yourself. You can help yourself find constellations by consulting star charts and star atlases, or by using a stargazing app."

If you want help identifying stars in the sky, these clubs often have experienced members who can help teach you. This might be especially useful if you\u2019re having trouble reading star charts.
