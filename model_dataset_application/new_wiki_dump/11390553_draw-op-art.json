Create random undulations and avoid making sharp angles (like mountain peaks). The more \u201cwaves\u201d you make, the more complex your finished drawing will appear. Start with about 3-4 waves if you\u2019re a beginner. Place 8 dots along the line\u20142 near the edges, 6 randomly spaced. Place a dot on the wavy line within about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the left edge of the paper, and place another one within about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the right edge. Draw the other 6 dots in between these 2, wherever you feel like putting them! In your head, label these dots \u201c1\u201d through \u201c8\u201d from left to right\u2014but don\u2019t jot the numbers on the page! To increase the complexity, add more dots\u2014but 8 is good for a beginner. Draw arches above the wavy line that connect the dots. In other words, draw an upward-curved arch (like a rainbow) that starts at dot 1 and ends at dot 2. Do the same between dots 2 and 3, and so on. Also start arches at dot 1 and dot 8 that disappear off the edge of the page. Vary the arches in height, making them about 0.25\u20130.5 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) high. The smaller in height they are, the more complex your drawing will appear. Repeat the arches again and again until they extend off the page. Draw a new arch on top of the initial arch between dots 1 and 2 (like a double rainbow! ), and do the same between dots 2 and 3 and so on. Keep doing this over and over again until all the arches above the wavy line run off the top of the page. The arches can vary in height as you go, but try to keep them within the 0.25\u20130.5 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) height range if that\u2019s what you started with.
