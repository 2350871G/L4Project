          "description":"CBD capsules are a convenient way to possibly relieve pain and inflammation throughout your body. Purchase a bottle of CBD capsules at your local drugstore, a dispensary, or online. Then, read the label on the bottle and take it as directed. Typically, you\u2019ll start with a small dose, such as 10 mg. Capsules don\u2019t provide immediate symptom relief because they need to pass through your digestive system. If CBD works for you, expect to see results in about 30-90 minutes after you take the CBD. You may need to increase your dosage amount when using CBD capsules compared with other delivery methods. Some of the CBD may be lost during digestion."

          "headline":"Use a CBD oil tincture for fast all-over post-workout relief.",
          "description":"You might choose a CBD tincture if you want quick, total body relief from pain and inflammation. CBD tinctures take effect in about 15-30 minutes if they work for you. To use the tincture, measure out about 1-2 drops using the eyedropper that came with your CBD. Then, squeeze the drops under your tongue and hold them there for about 30 seconds before swallowing. If you\u2019re using a tincture that comes in a spray bottle, apply 1 spritz to the inside of each cheek. You can purchase tinctures in different flavors if you prefer. Look for a CBD oil tincture at a drugstore, dispensary, or online.Variation: If the taste bothers you, mix 1-2 drops of the tincture into a glass of water or another non-alcoholic beverage. Drink the entire glass as fast as you can. Expect to feel the effects of the CBD in about 30 minutes."

          "headline":"Experiment with CBD edibles to see if they help you.",
          "description":"Edibles are a fun, easy way to use CBD, but they typically take several hours to become effective. Additionally, you may not get the same dose of CBD each time. If you want to try edibles, look for protein bars, protein powder, or post-workout snacks that contain CBD. Then, consume 1 CBD edible after each workout to help your muscles recover. If CBD edibles work for you, expect to feel the effects in about 2-4 hours after you eat the product. Edibles are commonly sold at dispensaries and online. Additionally, you may be able to buy them in the workout recovery section of your local grocery or health food store. Try different types of edibles because some may work better for you than others."

          "description":"Topical CBD oils are a great way to treat pain and stiffness at the site, and they may start working immediately. These products often contain both CBD oil and a carrier, such as coconut oil or beeswax. Use the oil after a workout or when you\u2019re experiencing sore muscles. To apply it, put a dollop of oil onto your fingertips, then massage it into your skin using circular motions. While the massage oil may provide immediate relief, it often takes up to 30 minutes for you to feel the effects. Additionally, CBD doesn\u2019t work for everyone, so you may not get results. If you don\u2019t get results, try using a different brand of CBD massage oil. Some products may work better for you than others."

          "description":"Smoking CBD oil provides immediate results if CBD works for you. If you\u2019re going to smoke it, the easiest and possibly safest option is to use a vape pen. To smoke it, attach a CBD oil cartridge to a vape pen battery and follow the battery\u2019s instructions to inhale a puff of CBD smoke. Start with 1 puff of smoke to see if it gives you the results you want. If 1 puff doesn\u2019t work for you, try 2 puffs. You may notice reduced soreness in as little as 30 seconds after puffing on your vape pen. Look for a vape pen battery and CBD oil cartridge at your local smoke shop, dispensary, or online. The vape pen battery is the base of the pen, and the cartridge is the part that holds the CBD oil.Warning: Smoking a vape pen may damage your lungs and respiratory system. Additionally, scientific evidence suggests it may also trigger shortness of breath and chest pain."

To relieve pain and inflammation after an injury, use CBD oil capsules, a tincture, or a vape pen. For pain relief at the site of your injury, apply a topical CBD massage oil. It\u2019s still important to rest, ice, and elevate your injured limb after the injury. Then, slowly rehab the sprain or strain like you normally would.
