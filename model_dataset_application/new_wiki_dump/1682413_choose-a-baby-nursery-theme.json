          "description":"A theme is a great option for a gender-neutral nursery. Many parents decide to create a baby nursery theme around a favorite character from children's literature or film. You can search for infant bedding that features a beloved character and then choose paint colors that will correspond with this theme. If you can\u2019t find decorations with the specific character, look for decorations that remind you of the feeling of the book or film. For instance, if you are using The Jungle Book, look for rainforest-themed objects. If you are inspired by Harry Potter, you can look for castles, owls, cats, or wizards. Be sure to choose a theme that will last for a few years as the baby grows."

For instance, a favorite beach could inspire a blue color scheme. A travel theme can be a simple as adding pictures from past trips or photographs of famous landmarks. You can also look for map-print bedding or include pieces that come from different countries such as furniture, fabric, or lamps. Consider including a mural of a special place or favorite landmark."

For instance, paint the furniture the colors of your favorite sports team. The team colors can even become your color theme. Sports memorabilia, such as tennis rackets, baseball bats, or jerseys can be hung as artwork. Sports balls or pictures of your favorite athlete can serve as decoration. Sports themes aren\u2019t just for boys! You could do a ballet, gymnastics, or volleyball theme for a little girl\u2019s room, for example."

As an example, if you love gardening, consider floral fabrics or stenciling plants onto furniture. If you are a collector, consider using part of your collection in the nursery.
