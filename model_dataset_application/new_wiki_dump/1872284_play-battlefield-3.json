Your best chances are, to flank the vehicle. Tanks and LAVs are weakest at the back, only 2 rockets are required to destroy them.

The Support role is very much behind the scenes. They are often a target for enemies, so be careful. You can use Supporter to strap C4 to friendly cars, drive up to enemy vehicles jump out and detonate the C4, killing the vehicle and destroying the car. You can simply plant it on an enemy vehicle, or blow up buildings where enemies are hiding. Claymores are most effective when you are trying to hold off a position you can't always be at. For instance, protecting Site A with claymores, whilst you are protecting Site B. Mortars are very rarely useful unless the enemy team are camping in close-quarters areas."

Give covering fire for your friendlies as you can see a lot more than they can. Do NOT use the MAV unless you will be targeting enemies. Using the MAV to get kills is becoming increasingly frowned upon, not to mention it lacks skill. Soflam should be used if your team are trying to take down vehicles (A lock from a SOFLAM does not last long, but it increases the damage of the heat-seeking rocket that is fired towards the locked vehicle). The TUG-S is useful when you first start using recon, just to make you aware of your surroundings."
