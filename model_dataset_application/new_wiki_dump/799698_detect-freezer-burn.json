Food wrapped in store bought packaging usually lasts about 1-2 months in the freezer, but if you plan to store your food longer than that, consider wrapping your food more securely. Try storing food in air-tight containers (soups, broths, fruit) or vacuum packaging (fish, meats)."

Because this barrier is broken, the food needs to be repackaged. For example, putting a whole bag of opened veggies inside a freezer bag or taking frozen fish sticks out of an opened box and putting them into a small, freezer safe container, are efficient ways to repackage and store opened frozen foods."

Then you continue to dip the now ice coated food in water and again, allow the water to freeze into a layering of ice. This dipping is done until there is a thick enough coating of ice over the food to protect it from penetrating outside air. Fish is often dipped in ice for preservation. Other raw foods that are preserved this way include chicken and other meat. Ice dips are also utilized to help save on plastic packaging costs."
