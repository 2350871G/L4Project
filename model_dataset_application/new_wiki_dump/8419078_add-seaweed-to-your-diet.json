          "description":"Seaweed salad is popular in Japan, and it\u2019s a cinch to make. Just put 1 ounce (28 g) of dry mixed seaweed in a bowl. Fill the bowl with cold water. Let the seaweed rehydrate for 5 minutes if you like crunchy seaweed. If you like softer seaweed, allow it to rehydrate for 10 minutes. In a small mixing bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar, 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon ginger juice. Add an additional teaspoon of rice vinegar for good measure. Drain the seaweed. Wring out any excess water by squeezing it gently by hand. Wipe the bowl down and put the seaweed back in the bowl. Pour the ginger/soy sauce dressing over it. Mix the dressing and seaweed so that the seaweed is thoroughly coated. Top with 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds and 1 diced scallion. Seaweed salad is great on its own or as a topping for burgers."

          "description":"Sunomono is a twist on the regular seaweed salad. To get started, combine 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) rice vinegar, 1/8 teaspoon soy sauce, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, and 1.5 teaspoons lemon juice in a small bowl. Set aside. Put 2.5 tablespoons dried wakame seaweed in a bowl with 12 fluid ounces (350 mL) of water. Set aside for about 10 minutes and allow the seaweed to rehydrate. Slice 2 or 3 Japanese or Persian cucumbers into thin slices. In a third bowl, mix the cucumber slices with a generous amount of salt. Allow the salt to remove moisture from the cucumber for about 10 minutes. Rinse the cucumber slices off in a colander. Gently squeeze any water that may have been reabsorbed by placing the slices between a few sheets of paper towel and pressing the water out. Mix the cucumber and wakame, then pour a tablespoon or 2 of the dressing over each serving."

          "description":"Instead of making seaweed the star of your salad, give it a supporting role. Heat 2 toasted nori sheets up in the oven on your oven\u2019s lowest setting. Check the sheets frequently. When they turn slightly brown and crispy, remove them. Break them into smaller pieces and grind them with a mortar and pestle. Pour the nori dust in a blender and combine with 1 tablespoon orange zest, \u00bd tablespoon salt, 2 tablespoons sesame oil, and 6 fluid ounces (180 mL) of rice wine vinegar. Pour it in an empty dressing bottle or squirt bottle. Refrigerate and shake well before use. Seaweed dressing is great over roasted veggies or salads, and also works well as a marinade for fish."

You\u2019ll need to remove and readjust the position of the mat temporarily to allow you to continue rolling, otherwise you\u2019ll end up rolling the mat right into the roll. Cut the sushi roll into slices 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) wide using a sharp knife. This recipe should provide enough tofu, rice, and veggies to make 4 or 5 sushi rolls.
