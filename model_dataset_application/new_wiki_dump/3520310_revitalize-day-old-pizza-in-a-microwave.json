Metal should never be used in a microwave as it can cause fires. If you have nothing else, use a paper plate. Make sure the plate doesn't have a plastic coating on the surface.

Next, break the pizza down into sections so that you can microwave two or three pieces of pizza at a time. Spread the pieces apart so that they're not touching to help them heat evenly. If you have more than two or three pieces of pizza you should plan to microwave them in batches. If you microwave a lot of pieces at once they won't heat through properly and you'll have to eat cold, rubbery pizza! If you like your crust really crispy, skip the paper towel and put your pizza on parchment paper instead."

Fill the cup about two-thirds full of fresh tap water. The water will help fluff up the pizza crust and revitalize the toppings. Make sure the ceramic cup fits inside the microwave with the plate. If it doesn't fit side-by-side, stack the plate on top of the cup. Try to use a mug with a handle so that you can safely retrieve the hot mug when you're done microwaving your pizza. If you don't have one, wait for the ceramic cup to cool completely before removing it."

          "description":"Microwave everything in one minute intervals at half power until the pizza is as hot as you like it. By reheating the pizza slowly, you give the ingredients more time to come to the same temperature. Toppings that would normally heat up faster than the rest of the pizza won't be lava hot when you try to eat them. Similarly, the inside of the pizza won't be cold either. Check if the pizza is hot enough by placing a finger near the pizza. If you touch the pizza, you may get burned. If you need your pizza in a hurry, microwaving in thirty second intervals at normal power will work as well. However, your crust may not be as soft."

This won't damage your oven, but you'll miss out on some extra cheesy goodness! Always use heat protected oven mitts or a sturdy hand towel when placing food into an oven.

If you used a foil-lined cookie sheet simply use oven mitts or a sturdy dish towel to lift the tray out of the oven. If you placed your pizza directly on the oven rack you'll need to be more careful. Position the serving plate to be level with the oven rack. Use tongs to slide the pizza from the oven rack onto the serving dish. Be careful not to burn yourself. Don't try to lift the pizza with your tongs or you'll risk all of your cheese and toppings falling off. Try to gently pull the pizza onto a plate to cool.

Place one or two slices of microwaved pizza on the skillet using tongs. After about thirty seconds to a minute, use the tongs to lift the pizza and check the bottom. Cook until it's as crispy as you like it. Don't crowd the pan. If you put too many slices of pizza in the pan at once, the crust won't crisp evenly. If you want a crunchier finish, melt half a tablespoon of butter in the pan before heating up the pizza. This will add a buttery, deliciously flaky finish to the bottom crust."

They should be clustered together in the upper left corner of the pizza slice near the crust. Then, fold the pizza. Bring the bottom point up to the top left corner and press the pizza to make a fold. Finally, press your pizza into a pre-heated waffle iron and cook for about five minutes, continually checking for doneness. If you have small pizza pieces or a large waffle iron you don't need to fold the pizza or rearrange the toppings. Instead, sandwich two pizza pieces together and press them in the waffle iron."
