          "description":"Many vegetarians do not realize how much added sugar (i.e. refined carbohydrates) they are consuming. This is because food manufacturers add sugar to almost everything, including soy-based products, beverages, yogurt, and salad dressings. In order to reduce the amount of carbohydrates and added sugars in your diet, you should read nutrition labels carefully. Look for words that end with \"ose\" to detect added sugars. For example, added sugars can appear as fructose or lactose, which are natural sugars that usually come in small doses and are easy to identify on food labels. Some added sugars will be harder to detect than others and may even appear to be healthy. For example, organic brown rice syrup, barley malt syrup, and agave nectar are all types of added sugars that are essentially refined carbohydrates and should be avoided."

A certain amount of carbohydrates are actually recommended because this is one of the best sources of energy for your body. Refined carbohydrates, however, should be avoided. This is often considered the \u201cno white foods\u201d strategy. Eliminate or significantly reduce all sugar, white flour, white rice, white pasta, as well as potatoes from your diet. Refined carbohydrates are created when whole plants, such as grain, are stripped of all nutrients but the easily digestible carbohydrate. The majority of fiber and nutrient in the plant is removed, leaving only refined sugar or refined starch."

These foods are typically those that  are found in boxes or bags at the grocery store. For example, cereals, breads, pastries, cookies, crackers, and muffins are all considered processed foods that contain refined carbohydrates. Try steel-cut oatmeal instead of boxed cereal for breakfast. Make homemade baked goods, such as muffins and cookies, so that you can control the ingredients being used."

This is not possible if you are trying to follow a low carb vegetarian diet because whole grains contain carbohydrates that are easily digested and broken down into glucose. Eggs only contain trace amounts of carbohydrates and provide an excellent source of protein for vegetarians. They also contain nutrients that can not be found in plant foods, such as vitamin B12. Try omega 3-enriched or free range eggs, if possible, for the healthiest option. Add eggs to your diet by making an omelette with fresh vegetables for breakfast. For lunches and dinners you could try eating a vegetable quiche or a salad with hard boiled eggs. There are multiple ways to include eggs in your diet.
