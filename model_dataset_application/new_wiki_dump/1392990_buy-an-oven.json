          "headline":"Determine your existing fuel type.",
          "description":"Your oven choice will largely be determined by the type of fuel line that you have in your house (unless you want to change your connection type). Gas ovens will have a gas line connected to your existing stove. An electric oven will be connected to an electrical plug point. Gas-powered ovens use either natural gas or propane depending on your town. Gas ovens are more expensive to purchase than electric ovens, but they cost less to run. If you want to change from an electric line to a gas one, you will need to find out if gas is easily available in your area. You can do this by doing a quick online search of gas availability in your area."

          "headline":"Choose a gas oven if you love making roasts.",
          "description":"Gas ovens are less drying than electric ones and are ideal for roasts and casseroles. However, they do not distribute heat as efficiently as electric ovens, unless they have an inbuilt fan. Gas ovens can range from $600 for a bottom of the range oven, up to about $7000 for a top of the range one. If you opt for an oven with a fan, make sure that the fan is surrounded by a heating element. This will ensure that heat is evenly distributed in your oven."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Buy an electric oven if you want more choice.",
          "description":"Electric ovens are the most popular type of oven. While they provide less control over your heat settings on the cooking hob, heat will distribute more evenly within the oven chamber itself. Electric ovens are the most popular type of oven, so your selection options will be greater. These ovens range from about $500 to $5000. If you are opting for an electric oven, you need to decide on a coil type. Open-coil burners are coils on top of the range in a slightly concave position. These are great because you can see the intensity of the heat. Smooth-top burners are completely flat, and the heat comes from under a glass panel. These are easier to clean and because they don't get as hot as the pan won't burn food if it spills. Smooth-top burners heat up slower than open-coil burners. However, gas hobs are the easiest to control."

          "headline":"Choose a dual-fuel oven if you want the best of both.",
          "description":"These ovens tend to use gas to power the cooking hobs and electricity to power the oven. These are a popular choice and allow you to control the temperature of the cooking plates with greater accuracy."

          "headline":"Choose a convection oven if you like cooking quickly.",
          "description":"Convection ovens use fans to spread heat evenly throughout the interior. They cook food more quickly than conventional ovens and cook your food evenly. However, they are more fragile than conventional ovens, and some recipes might need to be adjusted when using them. These are a great option for students on a budget. Convection ovens cost between $100 and $500. They are more energy efficient than conventional ovens and better for the environment."

          "headline":"Decide between a range or an oven.",
          "description":"A simple oven is just the cooking chamber, whereas a range is a two-in-one appliance.The oven chamber is located at the bottom of the range and your cooking hobs are at the top. Range ovens allow you to cook more versatile dishes and have the added benefit of having all cooking options in once place. Range ovens will be slightly more expensive as they come with a cooking hob as well as the oven chamber. Range prices will vary depending on if they are gas or electric, but you can get a basic range for about $600."

          "description":"Built in ovens are great if you need extra kitchen space, and they have the added benefit of being tailored to your height specification so that you don't have to bend down too much. However, if you do not currently have a wall cabinet cut out or space for a built-in oven, this could bring extra costs like renovation fees. Freestanding ovens are usually easier to clean and offer you more flexibility regarding where you place your oven."

Dehydration options are great if you're into raw food and want to retain as many nutrients from food as you can.
