The natural light from the moon can obstruct your view so that smaller meteors are undetectable and even bigger ones appear dim. Try to choose a night during the shower that the moon is in the new moon phase, or as close as possible. A full moon is the worst time to try and watch the Leonids meteor shower."

Assuming that the moon isn\u2019t full or nearly full on this night, it will be the best time to watch the shower. The next major Leonids outburst is scheduled for 2033. These outbursts are when the show is most impressive to watch. Even in years when no major outbursts are expected, however, you can still catch a less spectacular show on a dark, clear night."

Keep your eye turned to the darkest part of the sky, and avoid looking at any lights (including a cell phone). You should also give your eyes 15 minutes or more to adjust to the low light. You could watch the shower from a mountain top or a clearing in the forest with a good view of the sky."
