While the water is heating up, you can get together everything you are going to need to make the dinner.  Get out the regular spaghetti noodles and grab them around as if you are making a small circle with your fingers (if it is for one person). Then break them in half so that they will be easier to eat. Make sure to have a pasta strainer in the sink for when the noodles are done cooking.  After a few minutes or so the water should begin boiling or at least be bubbling. At this point you can put the noodles in the water. Then lower the temperature on the stove to somewhere between medium and high.  You will want to stir the noodles every few minutes so they do not get suck to each other or to the pot.
