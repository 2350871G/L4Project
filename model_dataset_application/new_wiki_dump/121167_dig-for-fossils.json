Keep moving along the same line near the edge, until a thin slab of shale falls off that side. Shale is composed of many fine layers, originally formed by sediment settling on the bottom of a lake or river. It typically breaks easily and is smooth to the touch. Because it's made up of layers, it usually has defined edges, not rounded ones. It can be almost any color, but reddish clay-type shale is common. The \"flat top\" is generally the thinnest edge with a flat area. Check the slab to see if you found any fossils! If you didn't find a fossil, keep working on the rock, breaking of thin slabs of shale each time. The thinner you can go, the better."

Bones mammals and reptiles can be much, much larger, of course. If you find a chunk you think might be a fossil, use some water to rinse it off. Most maintained sites will dig up or turn over big sections of earth that you can dig through with a small trowel. You can also rinse fossils off by the bucket. Take a small bucket of clay, and rinse it off in a river or with a hose. Pour out the mud over a colander or sift, letting the clay run through and leaving behind rocks and (possibly!) fossils."

When taking the photo, use your finger to point out where you found the fossil, and take the photo from multiple angles. It's also good to write down the specific location, including the bed name if it has one. Put a label on the bottom of your fossil once you get home, then reference that label in your notes.
