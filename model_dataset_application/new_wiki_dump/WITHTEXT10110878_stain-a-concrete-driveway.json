          "description":"Follow the mixing directions on your cleaner to make a cleaning solution in a 5 US gal (19 L) bucket. Dip the end of the broom into the bucket or pour some of the solution on the concrete to scrub any existing stains or residue off your driveway. Cleaners like trisodium phosphate (TSP) work best for scrubbing your driveway. Existing marks on your concrete will stain different colors and will not have a uniform look."

          "description":"Hold the nozzle of the pressure washer 6 inches (15 cm) from the surface of the concrete and work in long back and forth strokes. You\u2019ll notice the dirt and residue being removed from the surface of the concrete as you work across your driveway. Sometimes, using a pressure washer will clean enough residue where you won\u2019t have to use a cleaner. A power washer attachment for a garden hose will work fine. If you don\u2019t have access to a power washer, scrub the concrete with water and a stiff brush thoroughly."

Find the color that would work best for you and purchase the amount of stain needed for your driveway. The amount of stain you need will depend on the size of your driveway, but 1 gallon (3.8 L) of stain will cover 200 to 300 square feet (19 to 28 m). Read the label on the bottle to determine how much you\u2019ll need to effectively stain your driveway."

It\u2019s not necessary to dilute the acid with water, but you can mix it with an equal amount of water if you want a lighter color. Use caution when working with acid. Keep it away from your skin, eyes, or mouth since it is corrosive. Pump sprayers can be purchased at your local home and garden store. Pump sprayers with metal will corrode due to the hydrochloric acid present in the stain."

Spray the concrete so it is saturated but don\u2019t let the stain puddle. Make sure all areas of your concrete are covered so the stain works evenly across the entire surface."

Start in the center of your driveway again and work your way to the outer edges, allowing 4 hours of drying time in between each coat. Rinse a small corner of your driveway to see how the stain has affected the concrete to see if you like the color. If you\u2019re happy with the color after 1 coat, you can skip adding more. Wear disposable booties if you want to protect your shoes from the acid wash."
