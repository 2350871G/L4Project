          "description":"To avoid harming desired plants, make sure to positively identify ground ivy. Ground ivy, or creeping Charlie, spreads quickly to form a dense, mat-like groundcover, starving grass and nearby flowers or vegetables of necessary nutrients. Ground ivy produces clusters of small blue or purple flowers. The plant\u2019s leaves are small and coin-shaped with scalloped or round-toothed edges. Since ground ivy is a member of the mint family, it has square stems and is somewhat aromatic, especially after its leaves are cut or crushed."

          "description":"Remove the plant by holding the stem as close to the soil as possible as you pull. This will help ensure that the entire root is completely removed from the ground. Any remaining root will encourage re-growth. Make sure to wear garden gloves to protect your hands as you work. Ground ivy is difficult to pull up from the ground because of its many roots, which cause it to stick to the ground like Velcro. The plant quickly spreads by sending out runners (stolons), which sprout roots at each of its connective nodes. You\u2019ll need to painstakingly remove each root-source from the ground to ensure that the plant will not return. It will be easier to pull up long strips of ground ivy at a time when the soil is moist. Weed after a rain or watering your lawn to make this tedious task a little more bearable. In addition to seeding, ground ivy also reproduces with rhizomes, making it especially pervasive as well as tiresome to remove. These underground connective tubes can sprout roots and produce new plants. When you are pulling up the ground ivy by hand, you\u2019ll need to dig underneath the soil as well to reach the rhizomes. If you accidentally leave any behind, new plants will crop up and spread."

          "description":"Cover the patch of ground ivy with a tarp in order to starve the plant of air, light, and water. This method works best if you are only trying to target a small area. It is less practical if you are battling a yard-wide infestation, for example. Use a black piece of plastic in order to fully block out the light. You can also use mulch, which will starve the ground ivy of light while allowing your intentionally grown plants to thrive!"

Products such as Confront, Chaser, and Weed-B-Gon contain triclopyr and have proven to be successful at eliminating ground ivy. Make sure to carefully read the application instructions listed on the bottle and closely follow all safety guidelines.

This is an extreme solution and will effectively kill everything in your yard, including your grass. Carefully read the application instructions on the bottle. Roundup is a harsh chemical and should be handled and applied with extreme care. This method will require that you restart your lawn from scratch, either by reseeding in the fall or sowing a new bed of sod.

This makes them especially susceptible to the herbicide during this time. It is also best to apply herbicide during mild temperatures, between 60 to 80 \u00b0F (16 to 27 \u00b0C), and when there is no wind.

Borax, though primarily used as a laundry detergent, has also been found to be toxic to ground ivy. Researchers have identified the boron present in the Borax as the key ivy-killing ingredient. Use caution when applying the soap solution because Borax can also damage nearby plants, causing them to turn yellow and stunting their growth.
