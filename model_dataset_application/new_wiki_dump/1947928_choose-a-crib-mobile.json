For instance, strings on a mobile should be less than 7 inches (18 cm) long to prevent choking. Hanging objects should also be examined to ensure that they are not small or detachable. Mobiles are not safe for babies older than 5 months, or babies who are able to push themselves up onto their knees."

Used baby items may also be frayed or worn, which can cause a safety issue. Toys hanging from an older baby mobile might be more likely to fall off or break, which could harm your child."

The former will require you to drill a hook or screw into the ceiling, while the latter can be attached to the crib quickly and easily. Consider hanging a mobile over the baby's changing table to keep them distracted while they are being changed. If you plan to hang the mobile from the ceiling, make sure to select a spot where you can safely and securely anchor the mobile. If possible, try to anchor your mobile into a ceiling beam or joist."
