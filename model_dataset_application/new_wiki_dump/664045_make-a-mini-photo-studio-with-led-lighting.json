Individual LEDs, of course, give you the most precise control over your lighting. Unless you know what you're doing, don't buy LEDs by themselves; you'll have to worry about power sources, wiring and so on, all of which takes time better spent on having fun taking photographs. The easiest (and hardly more expensive) way is to buy some cheap novelty LED key-chains; they invariably come with batteries included, and you get a free switch thrown in, too. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/59\\/Diffused_torch_500.jpeg\\/460px-Diffused_torch_500.jpeg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/59\\/Diffused_torch_500.jpeg\\/760px-Diffused_torch_500.jpeg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":375,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":619.9428571428572,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>torch, diffused by a rizla.\\n<\\/p><p>i did this.\\n<\\/p><p>Image from: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Public_domain\\\">Public Domain<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}  A multi-LED torch, diffused with cigarette rolling paper, is an excellent addition. Cheap multi-LED torches are another good source of LED lighting. You'll want a couple of these. Bear in mind that the directed, multi-LED light from one of these will massively overpower your single LEDs. You'll want to diffuse the light with thin paper, such as cigarette rolling papers. Don't buy anything that doesn't have batteries included."

Optionally, a piece of glass under your subject works well to cut out harsh shadows under your subject, and the reflections look somewhat cool to boot."

Make sure both your subject and your studio are meticulously clean, or at least as close to it as you can be bothered to get."

      "description":"Because nothing's moving, speed doesn't matter here, so you can take as much time as you need to get it looking as good as it can \u2014 that means low ISOs, small apertures for depth of field, and (consequently) long exposures. You'll also need to set up your camera to deal with the weird colour balance typical of LEDs.Get it on a tripod. If you don't have a tripod, get one, even the cheapest, nastiest plastic tripod you can find. You'll be looking at taking some very long exposures (into the seconds), so you can rule out hand-holding the camera. If you have a remote release (or self-timer) and a mirror lock-up, use these too. Set your white balance. Bright \"white\" LEDs actually have a significant blue/purple shift. If you're too lazy to use a grey card and set a custom white balance (even if your camera supports it), your best bet here is to set it to \"Auto\", and pray (which is how all the example photos here were done). If your camera guesses it wrong, you can always fix this later in software. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/4\\/49\\/FD_blurry_405.jpeg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/4\\/49\\/FD_blurry_405.jpeg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":411,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":679.0022675736961,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>LED lighting shot, illustrating the very narrow depth of field up-close\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\nImage by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}  Depth of field is critical close up; at f/2 at half a meter, depth of field is almost non-existent, as illustrated by the defocus visible here. Set your camera to aperture-priority auto-exposure if you have it. Because we're taking photographs of relatively small things at short distances, you're going to need every bit of depth of field you can get. Use the small aperture you have, typically anywhere between f/16 and f/32. Turn down your camera's ISO as low as it will go, and don't use \"Auto\" if you have it. Lower ISOs mean less noise and longer shutter speeds; we don't care about the latter (since we're not in a rush and nothing's moving) and less noise is always better. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/ff\\/Helios_44m-4_893.jpeg\\/460px-Helios_44m-4_893.jpeg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/f\\/ff\\/Helios_44m-4_893.jpeg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":513,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":847.9428571428572,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>helios 44M-4 lens. i did this.\\n<\\/p><p>use freely, link to <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external free\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/lewiscollard.com\\/\\\">http:\\/\\/lewiscollard.com\\/<\\/a> if you re-use it\\n<\\/p><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/2.5\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}  This old 58mm (90mm equivalent) lens took most of the photographs in this article.
