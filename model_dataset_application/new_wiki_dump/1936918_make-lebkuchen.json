  "text":" Preparing the Dough Place a fine mesh sieve over a large bowl and sift the flour, baking soda, nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon together until you\u2019ve sifted all of the dry ingredients. Depending on the size of your sieve, you may have to do this in batches. Stir the dry ingredients briefly after they\u2019re sifted using a whisk to make sure they are blended well.  Heat the honey in a large saucepan over low heat. The honey should become thinner in consistency without becoming hot. Take the honey off the burner and let it cool slightly.  Add the brown sugar, lemon juice and grated lemon rind to the slightly cooled honey and mix it all together with a whisk.  Add the egg to the honey mixture, mixing with the whisk until the ingredients are well combined.  Add 1/3 of the sifted flour mixture to the wet ingredients, whisking to combine them.  Add an additional 1/3 of the flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon to combine (the mixture is too thick for the whisk at this point).  Add the final 1/3 and continue mixing by hand until the dry ingredients are incorporated.  Combine the cardamom, citron and almonds with the rest of the mixture, stirring well with a wooden spoon.  Pour the mixture into an airtight container, preferably one that you\u2019ve sterilized by running it through the dishwasher or dipping it in boiling water.  Place the lid tightly onto the container and allow the ingredients to sit at room temperature for 24 hours so that the mixture can mellow.  Baking the Cookies Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Sprinkle some flour onto a cutting board, clean countertop or other work surface.  Roll out the dough using a rolling pin until the dough is about 1/4\" to 1/2\" (6 to 12 millimeters) thick. Your rolled dough should form a rectangular shape. Use a chef\u2019s knife to cut the dough into rectangular or square bars. Trimming the dough with your knife will make the pieces around the edges of the dough rectangle more uniform. If you do trim the dough, then shape the scraps into rectangles or squares so that none of the dough is wasted. Transfer the cookies onto the baking sheets that you\u2019ve lined with parchment paper. Leave about 1-1/2\" of space around each cookie. This will allow the cookies to expand as they bake. Bake a sheet of cookies for 7 to 8 minutes or until the cookies are lightly browned. The Lebkuchen will round out and puff while they are baking. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow it to cool on the stovetop for 2 minutes.  Remove the cookies from the parchment paper with a spatula and place them on wire racks to cool.  Bake the second sheet of cookies.  Line the first baking sheet with fresh parchment paper while the second batch of cookies are baking and add more Lebkuchen to the baking sheet.  Continue to rotate the baking sheets, making sure that each one has cooled before you add a new batch of cookie dough.  Adding the Icing Mix the confectioner\u2019s sugar, lemon juice and cream in a bowl with a whisk until all of the sugar lumps have dissolved.  Spread a thin layer of icing on top of each cookie using a butter knife or cheese spreader.  Top the cookies with half of a candied cherry, placing the flat side of the cherry half onto the icing. Alternatively, you can sprinkle the cookies with sliced almonds. Allow the cookies and the icing to cool completely before you remove the cookies from the racks. Store them in a tin or other airtight container, where they will keep for up to a month.",
