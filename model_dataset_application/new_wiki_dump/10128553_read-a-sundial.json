Instead, use a vertical sundial and follow the packaging instructions to set it up and point the gnomon correctly. At the equator, the sun rises along the eastern horizon and moves straight up, then sets on the western horizon. If you used a horizontal sundial, the shadow would fall mostly west in the morning and mostly east in the afternoon, instead of rotating slowly."

To fix this, first figure out how many hours you are ahead or behind Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which is at 0\u00b0 longitude. For every hour that you\u2019re ahead, the center of your time zone will shift by 15\u00b0 east; for every hour you\u2019re behind, the center of your time zone will be 15\u00b0 west. For example, Pacific Standard Time (PST) is 8 hours behind GMT. Multiplying 8 hours by 15\u00b0 gives you 120, so PST\u2019s center longitude is 120\u00b0 West.

If you live west of the central longitude, add your answer to the time; if you live east, subtract it. In Seattle, for example, you\u2019d multiply 2.3 by 4 to get 9.2. Since Seattle is west of the time zone\u2019s center, sundials in Seattle are 9.2 minutes behind clock time, so you need to add 9.2 minutes to make them equivalent. If your sundial reads that it\u2019s 1:40 pm in Seattle, then, you\u2019d add 9 minutes to estimate that it\u2019s 1:49 pm. Why 4 minutes? Since most time zones are 15\u00b0 of longitude wide, or 1 hour long, you can divide 60 minutes by 15\u00b0 to see that it takes about 4 minutes for the sun to move through 1 degree."

Calculating Clock Time from a Sundial See where the shadow line falls on your sundial. Once you\u2019ve set up your sundial, take a look at it when it\u2019s casting a shadow in the sunlight. Note the line that the shadow\u2019s outer edge lines up with and use it to read your sundial like a regular clock.

Find the center longitude of your time zone. Your sundial can be off by up to an hour compared to clock time depending on your longitude. To fix this, first figure out how many hours you are ahead or behind Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which is at 0\u00b0 longitude. For every hour that you\u2019re ahead, the center of your time zone will shift by 15\u00b0 east; for every hour you\u2019re behind, the center of your time zone will be 15\u00b0 west.

You can find your own longitude by looking it up online or with a GPS device. Then, calculate the distance from your longitude to the central longitude of your time zone, and note whether you\u2019re to the east or west of it. For example, Seattle is at 122.3\u00b0 West longitude. The central longitude of its time zone (PST) is 120\u00b0 West, so Seattle is 2.3\u00b0 away from it. Add or subtract 4 minutes for every degree away from the center. Now, use your calculation to get a more accurate estimation of the time from your sundial. Multiply the difference between your longitude and the central longitude by 4. If you live west of the central longitude, add your answer to the time; if you live east, subtract it. In Seattle, for example, you\u2019d multiply 2.3 by 4 to get 9.2. Since Seattle is west of the time zone\u2019s center, sundials in Seattle are 9.2 minutes behind clock time, so you need to add 9.2 minutes to make them equivalent. If your sundial reads that it\u2019s 1:40 pm in Seattle, then, you\u2019d add 9 minutes to estimate that it\u2019s 1:49 pm. Why 4 minutes? Since most time zones are 15\u00b0 of longitude wide, or 1 hour long, you can divide 60 minutes by 15\u00b0 to see that it takes about 4 minutes for the sun to move through 1 degree. Add 1 hour if it\u2019s Daylight Saving Time. You\u2019ll need to adjust your time even more during Daylight Saving Time, which runs from early spring to mid-fall.
