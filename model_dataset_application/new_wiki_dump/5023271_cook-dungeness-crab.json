      "headline":"Cook.",
      "description":"Steam or boil your crab at 7-8 minutes/pound, lid on but tilted to allow venting. Steam the crab because steam decreases the amount of water retained in the body cavity. Boiling will get the job done quite well, though, and more people are likely to have a big pot than a big steamer. Start your timer when the water starts to boil. Base your number of minutes on the average crab weight, not the sum total of the crab you will be cooking. Round times down whenever necessary; undercooked crabs can always be cooked further, while overcooked rubbery crab is inedible. Add some seasonings to your water when using the boiling method. Add salt, a bay leaf, some celery chunks, a carrot, some pepper corns, and any other whole spices you've got on hand. Pre-mixed crab boil seasonings are available, but not necessary."
