We've provided a few sample recipes above. For stir fry beginners, it doesn't get much easier than the \"Basic\" sauce at the top of the list.

If you're using the \"Basic\" recipe above, make sure the sugar in the recipe is dissolved before proceeding or it may give the dish uneven \"sweet spots\" when it's added. If you're having a hard time getting the sugar to dissolve, try heating the sauce up somewhat \u2014 as a rule of basic chemistry, liquids dissolve substances like sugar more easily when they're warm. However, you won't want to heat the sauce to the point that it's very hot or boiling \u2014 this can caramelize the sugar, giving the sauce a \"sticky\" texture and an odd taste."

The ideal thickness of your sauce is usually a matter of personal taste. The 1/2 teaspoon recommended in the recipe above should give a fairly liquid sauce, but anything from zero corn starch to twice the recommended portion is acceptable. Note that this thickening rule applies to the rest of the recipes in this article as well. Though it may not be explicitly mentioned below, adding additional corn starch to any of the following recipes will make a thicker sauce, while removing corn starch from the recipe will make a thinner sauce."

With this method, all you need to do is add your sauce ingredients to a jar, close the lid tight, and shake to combine. Make sure the lid is secure \u2014 a big mess is in store if it pops off!. Other containers work just as well as jars as long as they can achieve an airtight seal. For instance, plastic fridge containers (like Tupperware, etc.) work great in a pinch."

Once your stir fry ingredients have achieved a good sear and are more or less finished cooking, pour your sauce in. Your sauce should quickly heat. Within about 30 seconds to a minute, remove the pan from heat and serve! Another good option is to use your sauce for dipping. In this case, keep it cool and separate from the other ingredients in its own bowl. This is a good choice if, for instance, once of your guests is allergic to some of the ingredients in your sauce."

Don't skip out on this small but important step \u2014 the orange zest gives the sauce an impeccable flavor and fragrance. To grate orange zest, simply take a ripe orange and rub the rind against a microplane grater (or an ordinary cheese grater) to shred off small flakes.

If you don't have red peppers handy, try adding dry red pepper flakes for the same effect. When in doubt, be conservative. You can always add more spice if your stir fry turns out too mild, but you can't take spice out once it's been added!
