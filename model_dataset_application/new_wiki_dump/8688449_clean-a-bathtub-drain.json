  "text":" Flushing the Drain with Boiling Water Open your drain stopper. Hit the switch on your tub or unscrew the drain stopper to an open position so that water can go down your drain. If water is slow, or your tub fills up and doesn't drain, your drain has to be unclogged before you can clean it. Boil a pot of water. Bring a 2 L (8.5  c) pot or kettle of water to a boil on your stovetop. The hot water will be able to flush away any loose hair or soap scum in the drain. Pour the water down the drain. If you have metal pipes, you can pour the boiling water directly down the drain. You should do this at least once a week to flush out built up soap scum and gunk that's left over from bathing. Deodorizing Your Bathtub Drain Remove your drain stopper. Tubs have different types of drain stoppers depending on what kind of tub you have. Some stoppers, like a push-pull stopper, will require you to remove screws in your drain, while others simply require you to unscrew the stopper to pull it free. To clean the inside of your drain, you'll need to completely remove the drain stopper. Pour a cup (180 g) of baking soda into the drain and let it sit for 20 minutes. Use a measuring cup to measure out a cup (180 g) of baking soda, then pour it down the drain. As the baking soda sits, it should absorb the unpleasant odors coming from the drain. Remove the gunk from the inside of your drain with a bottle brush. Get a bottle brush that is at least 1.25 inches (3.2 cm) in diameter and stick the brush end into the vertical pipe connected to your drain. Move the brush up and down while rotating it to remove the gunk from the inside of your drain. Pull all of the dirt and hair out of the drain with the brush.

Clearing an Obstruction with a Tool Remove the drain stopper. Remove the drain stopper completely by either pulling it out or by removing the screws that are in the face of the stopper. To pull the gunk and hair from the drain, you'll need to make sure that you can access the vertical pipe that runs from your drain. Remove gunk and hair with pliers or a plastic snake. You can purchase a plastic snake that has teeth on it from a home improvement store or you can use pliers. Work your tool into the drain and try to snag any grime or hair that's caught in the drain.
