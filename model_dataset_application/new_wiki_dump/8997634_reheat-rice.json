  "text":" Reheating in the Microwave Place rice in a microwave-safe container. Put the rice onto a plate or in a bowl, or just use a plastic container that is safe for use in the microwave.

The amount of water will depend on the amount of rice, but will typically be no more than one tablespoon of liquid per cup (340g) of rice. There should be enough moisture to steam the rice, but not enough that the rice is sitting in a puddle of water after heating. Break up clumps with a fork.

Dump the rice from its container into a saucepan. Any size pan is fine, though it should comfortably hold the rice without you needing to press it down for it to all fit. Add a splash of water. The amount of water will depend on the amount of rice, though a couple tablespoons should be enough for a single serving.

If after 20 minutes you think the rice is still too dry, pull it out of the oven, sprinkle another tablespoon of water over the rice, and place the lid back on.
