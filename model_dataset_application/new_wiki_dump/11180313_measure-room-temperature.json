They also react to temperature changes faster than other types of thermometers so you always have an accurate reading. Some digital thermometers have the capability to store temperature readings. So you can compare the room temperature over time to see how it changes."

          "description":"Glass thermometers use a glass tube filled with liquid to measure the temperature. As the air around the thermometer gets warmer, the liquid moves up the tube and can be used to get a close measurement of the room temperature. Choose a glass thermometer that doesn\u2019t contain mercury. Mercury is highly toxic and can be dangerous if the thermometer breaks. Glass thermometers can also be called a bulb thermometer or a liquid-in-glass thermometer."

They use a strip of metal that expands and bends as the temperature increases. As the strip expands or contracts, it moves the pointer on the scale. The big arrow of the pointer makes it easy to check the room temperature. Bimetallic thermometers aren\u2019t as accurate as digital thermometers."

          "description":"No matter what type of thermometer you use, you need to place it in the center of the room at least 2 feet (0.61 m) off of the ground for an accurate measurement of room temperature. Mounting a thermometer on a wall can produce inaccurate results because the heat from the walls can distort the reading. Set the thermometer on a table or stool so the temperature of the floor doesn\u2019t affect the reading.Tip: Make sure there aren\u2019t any sources of heat near the thermometer."

Thermometers, especially glass and bimetallic, need a few minutes to accurately read the temperature of the room. Don\u2019t hold or stand directly next to the thermometer or your body heat could affect the temperature reading."

A general room temperature measurement is around 70\u201375 \u00b0F (21\u201324 \u00b0C). A digital thermometer will display the temperature on its screen and will be the most accurate. Read the numbers next to the top of the liquid in a glass thermometer to measure the temperature.
