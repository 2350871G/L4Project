          "headline":"Perform a precursory search to see if you have any high-end suits.",
          "description":"Some vintage suits fetch high prices on the secondary market, so start by looking each of your suits up online. Pull up a search engine online and type in the name of the brand on tag inside the jacket. Include the year, model name, or designer if there is one. Flip through the results for each brand to see if you have any jackets that fetch a particularly large price.If you have any suits that look like they sell for more than $100, set them aside so that you can sell them privately and earn the most money possible. If you have more than 3-4 suits, keep a running list of what each suit is worth by writing it down. This way, you won\u2019t have to keep looking prices up online."

          "headline":"Find each suit online and determine what they sell for to set a price.",
          "description":"After setting aside the expensive suits, look each specific suit online. Type in as much information as you can and inspect the images online until you find your specific suit. Then, go on eBay or Poshmark and look at identical items to see what they sold for. This will give you market value for your suits and help you determine what you want to sell them for.Tip: If the suit was custom-made but the designer or tailor isn\u2019t particularly popular, take it to a consignment store. It won\u2019t sell well online, but a buyer at a consignment store might like the way it looks. Poshmark is a popular resale site for used clothing. After eBay, it\u2019s probably the most popular option for used suits. If the suit was mass-produced, look at the bottom of the tag for a sequence of letters and numbers. This is usually a model number, and typing it in after the brand name will usually lead you to the exact suit."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Adjust the price based on the quality of the suits.",
          "description":"Damaged and heavily-worn suits won\u2019t fetch a high price. Knock 10-50% off of any prices you set based on the extent and visibility of the damage. If the suits have never been worn, you may be able to get more than the market value for the suit. Heavily worn suits should generally be sold for 50-75% of the market value. Consider getting minor tears or rips repaired if you\u2019re going to sell a suit for more money than the repair is worth. A small tear on the interior lining on the suit is not nearly as big a deal as a large stain on the backside of a suit jacket. You don\u2019t need to determine a price if you\u2019re taking the suits to a consignment store, but it helps to know what they\u2019re worth before taking them in. This way, you can hold on to any items the clerk won\u2019t list for a reasonable price."

        {
          "headline":"Donate any suits that aren\u2019t worth more than $10-15.",
          "description":"If your suits aren\u2019t worth more than a few dollars, don\u2019t waste your time trying to sell them. The effort and the time investment will simply not be worth it. Instead, drop your suits off at a nearby donation center to get them off of your hands.There are many nonprofits that accept used suits and give them to low-income job seekers so that they can dress appropriately for an interview. These nonprofits are a great option when it comes to getting rid of suits."

This is the best way to ensure that you get top dollar for your suits.Get your suits dry cleaned before you take photos if you\u2019re selling them online as well. The suit will look much better in the photos if they\u2019re pristine."

Put matching pants underneath them if you\u2019re getting rid of them as well. Then, take 5-6 photos of your suit from different angles to give potential buyers a sense for what the suit looks like.Tip: Be sure to take 1-2 photos of the interior lining of the suit. Many potential buyers will want to know what the lining is made out of and ensure that the inside of the suit is clean. Don\u2019t include any photos of you wearing the suit."

Then, include the designer, year, and any other information about the production run. Finally, describe the overall condition of the suit and mention how often it has been worn. Be honest about any damage or wear-and-tear.An example of a good headline is, \u201c$95 \u2013 green Brioni suit 44R, pants 34x32.\u201d A solid description may read, \u201cThis suit was produced in 1995 and is no longer manufactured.

This way, you can\u2019t be accused of never shipping the item, which is a common scam on eBay.You can list cheaper suits on eBay as well, but you\u2019re more likely to find a buyer if you\u2019re selling a rare or high-end suit since there will be fewer people with the same suit."
