Use a chisel and hammer to split the tile. Tap the top of the chisel gently with the hammer so you do not disturb nearby grout joints. Loosen and pick up all tile pieces and fragments and its grout. Your goal is to maintain the quality and integrity of the surrounding tiles. Protect them by placing a thick layer of cardboard over them. Do not use them for leverage while working with the chipped tile. Slice through the grout line surrounding the broken tile using a grout saw. You can then begin removing the tile using your hammer and chisel, breaking it into pieces and removing them from the work area. Start at the corner or at the point of the break."
