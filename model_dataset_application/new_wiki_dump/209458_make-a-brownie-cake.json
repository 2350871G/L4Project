Line the cake pan with parchment paper, and grease the parchment paper as well. Set the cake pan aside when you are done. If you absolutely cannot get any parchment paper, then you can leave it out. The parchment paper will simply prevent the cake from sticking to the bottom of the pan."

Scrape the bottom and sides of the saucepan to ensure that everything gets evenly mixed. The nuts are not completely necessary, but they will give the cake more texture and flavor.
