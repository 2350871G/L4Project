If you find any do not take it. Check if the color is what it's supposed to be. For example, don't take a green strawberry. Look for bruises and spots that indicate the fruit has been roughly handled and damaged.  Smell the fruit. Some fruits have a \"ripe\" odor, like cantaloupe and honeydew melons. Some fruit may have a sour odor if they are beginning to spoil. Feel the fruit, but do so carefully.

If it's heavy for its size, then you have successfully found yourself a good piece of fruit! Strawberries Smell them. Do they smell like strawberries? Unripe or not flavoured strawberries will not have a very strong scent. Ripe, sweet strawberries smell strongly of strawberry. Pick ones of the right color. Strawberries should be a deep red all over. If they are a light red or have some green or yellow on them, they are not ripe and they won't taste good. Taste them. If the grocer allows it, always taste a sample strawberry. This is the single best way to know if you are getting decent strawberries. Choose the right size. Although those giant strawberries look most luscious, it's the smaller berries which can pack the most flavor punch. Buy them during the right season. The best season for strawberries is spring and summer. Strawberries at any other time of the year will lack flavor. Strawberries do not ripen after they are picked. Grapes Look at the colors of the grapes and stems. The stems of the grapes should be beige to brown, and drying up. Green, full stems mean the grapes are not ripe and they will tend to be sour or tasteless. Also, look for a slight pale-yellow hue on green grapes, while red grapes should be deeply colored with no sign of green. Buy in the right season.
