          "description":"These days, even a \u201cregular\u201d coffee is going to be more exciting than yesterday\u2019s cup of joe. Coffee shops will brew black coffee in several ways. Drip coffee is made by letting hot water flow through coarsely-ground coffee beans. It\u2019s usually kept on tap in large urns at coffee shops. This is a standard choice, but may be less flavorful than other brew methods. Pour overs are made by carefully pouring hot water over coffee grounds suspended in a filter over a container. These are usually made by the cup, allowing the hot water to sit with the grounds for longer and extract more flavor. French press coffee is made by letting coffee grounds sit in hot water for several minutes in a press pot. The coffee is then poured out, leaving the grounds behind. This method produces a bold flavor."

          "description":"Most coffee shops will have a variety of coffee types available for brewed coffee. Each has a particular flavor profile and caffeine content, which your barista will be happy to describe for you. Light roasts are very mild in flavor. They may be called \u201cLight City\u201d or \u201cHalf City\u201d roasts. Medium roasts have a deeper color and often a nutty flavor, but are still moderate in their intensity. They are sometimes marketed as \u201cAmerican\u201d or \u201cBreakfast\u201d roasts. Dark roasts are rich, bold, and sometimes bitter. They may be labeled as \u201cEuropean,\u201d \u201cEspresso,\u201d \u201cItalian,\u201d or \u201cFrench\u201d roasts. Coffee shops may offer both single origin coffees (such as \u201cMexican\u201d or \u201cSumatran\u201d), for unique tastes, as well as blends for balanced flavors."

          "headline":"Choose espresso for superior flavor.",
          "description":"Espresso is made by forcing a small amount of hot water under high pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. The intensely flavorful drink is then served in a small cup called a demitasse. A slight amount of coffee-colored foam, called crema, appears at the top of properly-pulled espresso. Espresso is sold by the \u201cshot\u201d: you can order a single, double (doppio), triple, and so on. Some coffee shops serve a smaller, especially intense \u201cristretto\u201d shot. Ounce for ounce, espresso usually has more caffeine than brewed methods. However, brewed coffee is served in larger amounts, meaning an overall greater amount of caffeine."

          "description":"An americano is a blend of espresso and hot water. It is served in larger amounts, like brewed coffee, but has a richer flavor because it is made with espresso. Some locations will serve a variation called a \u201clong black.\u201d An americano is made by pouring hot water into espresso, while a long black is made by extracting the espresso directly into the hot water, preserving more of the crema."

        },
        {
          "headline":"Try cold brew for a super smooth taste.",
          "description":"Cold brewed coffee is made by steeping coarsely ground coffee and cool water for a very long time (usually 12 to 24 hours). The unique extraction process pulls out mild, sweet flavors from the beans and leaves behind other compounds that can sometimes make coffee more bitter or acidic. Cold brewed coffee is often poured over ice, but it can also easily be served hot--just ask your barista."
