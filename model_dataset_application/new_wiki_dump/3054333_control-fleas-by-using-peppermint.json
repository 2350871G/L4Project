Make sure to get 100% pure peppermint oil so that you can make your own diffusions. Pure peppermint oil is made by pressing the oil out of peppermint leaves. Though peppermint does not kill full-grown fleas, it helps in restricting their attack on pets. One way it does this is by killing the larvae of fleas, which are more vulnerable."

Ensure that the solution is stirred or shaken together well before using it on your pet. Shake the solution before each use, as the parts will separate when not in use.

Pat the cotton ball or pad directly onto the pet's skin. Put it on any affected areas, which typically includes the animal's neck and back. These are spots most pets can't easily groom, so they tend to be where fleas congregate. The oil can also help soothe any itching or discomfort your pet has because of the flea bites."
