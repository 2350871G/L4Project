Simply reduce the amount of enriched all-purpose flour you use by about half, then fill in the missing portion with other low-carb derivatives like whole wheat, almond or rice flour. When the time comes to chow down, chances are you won\u2019t even be able to tell the difference. Adjust the amount of flour as you see fit for your own personal take on the recipe. Most of the carbohydrates in traditional waffles come from starchy white flour."

          "description":"If you happen to have an intolerance to gluten, or you\u2019re trying your best to stick to a holistic diet, you can dispense with flour altogether and bring in more nutrient-packed ingredients to do the job. Flax meal, rolled oats or even blended nuts will all work well for this purpose. Other types of grains can give your waffles a complex, nutty flavor. For smoother waffles, make sure your flour substitute has been ground or blended to a fine consistency."

          "headline":"Try it with eggs.",
          "description":"Not many people know that eggs can be used in place of flour, butter and milk. Combine 2-3 large eggs with a couple teaspoons of baking powder to help them set up. Add a sweetening agent, such as mashed bananas, and you\u2019re ready to go. It\u2019s that easy! Eggs are loaded with protein and good cholesterol, and when cooked they\u2019ll take on a fluffy, spongy texture that\u2019s nearly indistinguishable from traditional waffles made with flour. Whip whole eggs together with the baking powder and salt before incorporating them into your batter mix. It\u2019s even possible to make a simple carb-free version of waffles using only eggs and a few dry ingredients. Combine egg waffles with savory items like bacon crumbles, turkey sausage or low-fat cheese."

          "headline":"Replace butter with lighter options.",
          "description":"A good portion of the calories in waffles come from butter, whether mixed in with the batter or served on top. Instead of butter, give applesauce, Greek yogurt or the infinitely-useful coconut oil a shot. Taking butter out of the equation can spare you the long-term health risks, and the guilt, of high-fat breakfasts. Coconut oil is especially versatile, as it can be used as a spreadable semi-solid at room temperature or a smooth liquid when heated."

Add 2 eggs, a tablespoon of oil and a dash of vanilla extract to the dry ingredients and whisk until they form a smooth, thick mixture. Break up big lumps in the batter, but don\u2019t overstir. This can make the waffles dense and gluey.

No need to prep with cooking spray if you\u2019re using a newer nonstick waffle iron. Keep the heat somewhere between medium and high so that it doesn\u2019t get too hot between batches."

Once the batter begins to bubble, closed the lid of the iron. Make sure you pour the batter on thick enough to cover the grid ridges on the iron, or the waffles won\u2019t hold together. Most waffle irons will only be big enough to fix one waffle at a time. Portion each ladle of batter consistently so that you have none left over when you\u2019re done cooking."

A perfect waffle will come out golden-brown and crispy on the outside while still being light and airy inside. Repeat until you\u2019ve used up the remaining batter. Take a peek at the waffles periodically to make sure they\u2019re cooking evenly. Waffle batter can also be refrigerated for a day or two if you don\u2019t plan on using it all right away."

Nut butters are another good choice, as they spread well and contain high amounts of proteins and good fats. You\u2019ll still get the warm, sticky sweetness you crave, only without accidentally consuming an entire day\u2019s worth of carbs in one meal. Warm the sweetener in the microwave for a few seconds to make it easier to pour. Go easy on the sweetening syrups. Even low-sugar alternatives can add up if you use too much."

The sweet and tangy zest of fresh fruit provides a wonderful counterbalance to the mild, earthy qualities of whole grains. And, of course, you\u2019ll be receiving your daily dose of essential vitamins and minerals. If you prefer richer, more decadent toppings for your waffles, try cooking down fresh fruit with cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and a little bit of honey or stevia into a flavorful compote."

For instance, whipped cream or cream cheese can be traded for low-fat cottage cheese, and coconut flakes can be even better than powdered sugar when sprinkled on top. Mix in blueberries, chopped walnuts or dark chocolate morsels to give your waffles some variety of flavor and make them more filling. Don\u2019t feel like you have to replace every single main ingredient. A little butter or maple syrup is fine in moderation."
