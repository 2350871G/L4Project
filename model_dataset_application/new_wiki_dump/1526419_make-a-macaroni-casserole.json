Any type of tubular pasta can work. Avoid using long thin spaghetti like noodles, since they won't hold the cheesy sauce as well. Cavatappi, farfalle, fusilli, penne, and rotini are good examples of tubular noodles that hold a cheese sauce well. Try a few cheeses. For great results, try a mixture of different cheeses. This can help build flavor and make your pasta creamier. Sharp cheeses work best in macaroni casserole since the milk sauce doesn't have much flavor on its own. Try Feta, Gruyere, sharp white Cheddar, or Pecorino Romano. To create a stringy stretchy casserole, use Mozzarella or Monterey Jack. Add texture. Since macaroni casserole is pretty uniform in texture on its own, add a little crunch to mix things up. The easiest way to do this is by adding a topping. Try topping with a mixture of breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese. Scatter it over top and broil or bake as directed. For a bigger crunch, spread large homemade croutons over your casserole and broil or bake as directed. Stir in a few additions. If you want to round out your macaroni casserole to create a more rounded meal, consider adding a few of the following:\ncooked ground beef, crumbled bacon, diced sausages, shredded chicken, flaked tuna\nsteamed broccoli, sauteed mushrooms, green peas, fresh diced tomatoes, black beans Drizzle with a sauce. Add a little extra oomph to your casserole by adding a lot or a little of the following sauces:\nketchup\nbarbecue sauce\nsriracha sauce\ntabasco sauce\nsour cream\nsalsa",
