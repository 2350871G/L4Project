Wear gloves to prevent the juices from getting on your hands, as it can be quite painful if you go to rub your eye later on with spicy chili juice. Things to look for in spoiled chilies include soft and mushy areas, gray or white spots, or a particularly foul odor. If the chilies look diseased, do not use them for cooking and discard them."

Dry each chili thoroughly, as the drying process will take longer if the chilies get too wet. It's important to wash every vegetable, fruit, or pepper that you buy as there could be small bugs, germs, and industrial pesticide residue lingering on the skin."

          "description":"Chop the stem of each chili off as close to the flesh of the pepper as possible with a chef's knife. Then, cut the chilies in half longways and cut those halves in two again to create four long slices of pepper. Remove the seeds before drying the chilies and plant them in your garden to grow more or add them to your future recipes for a kick. Chopping the chilies into long pieces speeds the drying process substantially, but you can dry them whole as well if you plan to use whole dry chilies in your cooking rather than chopped dried chilies. Whole chilies take longer to dry than sliced ones."

          "headline":"Dry the chilies in a food dehydrator for the fastest option.",
          "description":"Food dehydrators are useful for drying out chilies as it only takes about 12 hours tops and works well with both chopped and whole chilies. Lay the chilies in the dehydrator spaced 1 in (2.5 cm) apart and set the temperature to 135 \u00b0F (57 \u00b0C). It's best to keep the dehydrator in an area with good ventilation to make it work efficiently. Check every couple hours to see how the smaller slices or whole chilies are doing. Remove any fully dried chilies when they look crispy to prevent them from cracking, as chili slices take a  much shorter time to dry than whole chilies. Some seeds will come out naturally in the dehydrator \u2014 collect these once your chilies are done drying to add to recipes, as they can't be replanted."

          "headline":"Dry the chilies in the oven if you don't have a dehydrator.",
          "description":"Turn the oven to its lowest setting, usually indicated by a \"WARM\" option on the knob, or turn it to 120\u2013140 \u00b0F (49\u201360 \u00b0C). Put the chilies on a large baking tray and place them in the middle rack. Keep the oven door slightly ajar, 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) at most. Turn the chilies every hour until all the moisture has left each pepper, and pay special attention to them if you opted for sliced chilies rather than whole ones as they take a shorter time to dry. If your chilies start to burn, you have the oven turned up too high. Keep it on the lowest setting, as the point is not to roast the chilies but slowly get rid of all the water. This process may take several days, so be prepared for your kitchen to warm up and turn the oven off at night and when you leave the house to prevent fires while you sleep and while you're away. Keep the chilies in the oven so they don't get contaminated and turn the oven back on first thing in the morning."

          "description":"You can dry your chilies in direct sunlight rather than in a dehydrator or oven. Tie a string to the top of each chili where you chopped away the stem and string it up to a trellis or a sideways wooden pole. Leave 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) between each chili to provide good air flow. You can use either whole chilies or sliced chilies, although whole chilies take a longer time. This process can take up to 2 weeks, even in good weather, so check on them every day and take them inside if the weather turns sour. Sliced chilies take a much shorter time to finish, so pay careful attention to them if you chose to cut them before hanging them to dry."

          "description":"Once your chilies have dried, either in the oven, dehydrator, or outside, simply place them in sealable plastic bags or containers and keep in a cupboard. You don't need to refrigerate dried chilies as they stay good for more than 6 months without needing to stay cool \u2014 only throw them away when they have an unpleasant odor or noticable spots growing on them. Dried chilies are perfect to grind up for seasoning, to chop up to add a kick to your recipes, or to collect in a bunch and hand out to your friends and family as gifts."

Leave the chilies whole to refrigerate them effectively. Remove any chilies that have soft and mushy areas, gray or white spots, or a particularly foul odor and discard them.

The chilies should stay fresh for up to 3 weeks (at least 20 to 25 days). Refrigerating chilies is the easiest way to store them, as it only takes a few minutes to prepare. They will not stay good for too long, so use them within this 3 week period. Don't worry about washing the chilies before you put them in the container.

Keep your freezer temperature on the medium setting so the chilies get very cold but don't over-freeze \u2014 they will come out limp no matter what when thawing, but if they are too cold, they will come out mushy and unappetizing.
