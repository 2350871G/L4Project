Atlantic Salmon are usually farmed, and the fish are fed a diet that can be full of growth hormones and coloring agents to turn the flesh pink. They are mass produced and fairly inexpensive. This kind of salmon also tends to have higher levels of PolyChlorinated Biphenyls, or PCBs, which are a highly toxic industrial chemical. The Environmental Defense Fund suggests consuming no more than one meal per month consisting of Atlantic salmon. Atlantic salmon is available all year long."

The harvest of wild salmon is strictly monitored and regulated with the aim of stabilizing or increasing the number of available fish. Wild salmon from Alaska is considered to be a sustainable harvest, due, in part, to the strict regulations and the fact that the fish is allowed to reproduce as naturally."
