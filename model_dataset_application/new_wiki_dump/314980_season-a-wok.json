Pat it dry with a towel, and set it aside to air dry while you prepare your ingredients. Before you season the wok, it\u2019s a good idea to ventilate your space. You'll be heating the wok to a high temperature, and it may let off smoke and fumes. Open a couple windows, and turn on your range fan or a standing fan."

          "description":"Turn the heat on your stove burner to high and place the wok on the heat. Wait for 30 seconds, and then start dripping small amounts of water into the wok. When the wok is ready, the water will evaporate almost immediately on contact. Some newer woks don\u2019t allow the water to evaporate. If that\u2019s the case with your wok, just preheat the wok for one minute."

Return the wok to the heat. The best types of oils or fats for wok seasoning include peanut, canola, grapeseed, palm, and lard."

          "description":"Add the ginger and scallions to the wok and turn the heat down to medium. Cook the vegetables for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring regularly. As the scallions and ginger cook, use the back of a spoon to mash them against the sides of the wok so they release their flavors. You can add another tablespoon (15 ml) of oil if the vegetables start to dry out during cooking."

If your wok doesn\u2019t change color at all during the cooking process, remove it from the heat after 20 minutes. Not all woks will change color."

          "description":"Remove the scallion and ginger from the wok and set it aside to cool. You can either discard the vegetables, or throw them into a soup or other savory dish. When the wok is cool enough to touch, rinse it under hot water and clean it with a sponge or cloth. Do not use soap, as this will remove the seasoning layer you just applied. Dry the wok as best you can with a towel, and then place it on the stove over low heat. Allow the wok to warm up for about two minutes, until all the water has evaporated. This will ensure rust doesn\u2019t form."

You can re-season your wok anytime you like, especially if you feel it isn't as non-stick and flavorful as you'd like. Over time, your wok will develop a black patina, and this is an indication that it\u2019s fully seasoned. When your wok is still new, avoid cooking acidic foods in it until the seasoning layer is fully established."

You may only need to soak it for a few seconds, but for tough, baked on food, soak it for up to 30 minutes. Use only clean and fresh water on your wok. Don\u2019t use soaps, detergents, or other cleansers, as these can damage the seasoning. Don\u2019t put a seasoned carbon steel wok in the dishwasher. Always wash it by hand."

If necessary, give it a gentle scrub with the green side of a kitchen sponge or a scratch-free scrubber. Once you\u2019ve removed all the food debris from the wok, rinse it under clean, hot water to remove any leftover particles.

When all the water has evaporated, remove the wok from the heat and set it aside to cool. Drying the wok with heat is more reliable than with a towel, and will help prevent rust."

Dry the wok with a towel, then heat it over medium-low heat until it\u2019s completely dry. To re-season the wok, add some cooking oil or shortening to the warm wok. Swirl the oil around, then remove the wok from the heat. Use a cloth to rub the oil into the surface of the wok, and wipe away the excess before storing. Avoid using steel wool on your wok unless it\u2019s to remove rust, because this removes the seasoning layer as well."
