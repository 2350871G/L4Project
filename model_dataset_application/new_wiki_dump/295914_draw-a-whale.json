  "text":" A Cartoon Whale Draw a curve that looks sort of like an upside-down dish. This will be the head. To the left end of the curve, draw a small lip that protrudes slightly, and continue the line in the shape of a smiling mouth.  On the right end of the head, draw two small curves, like fat rolls. This is the back. Below the smile, draw a half oval for the lower jaw. At about the halfway point of this shape, draw a line that will be the stomach. Draw a fin, and continue the stomach line at an upward slant toward what will be the tail.  Draw a tail. The easiest way to do this would be to draw each fin separately from the back line and the stomach line. Add detail: draw a cheek, an eye, and an eyebrow above the mouth. At the very top of the head, add a little line or circle for the blowhole. Draw another line around the lower jaw to make a lower lip. Stop the line before you reach the smile, though. Draw in a tongue. Also add a little line to make an upper lip. If you want, you can draw water shooting out of the blowhole.  Color your whale now, or else leave it as a pencil outline or you can draw the water underneath then you can draw water coming out.  A Realistic Humpback Whale Draw an oblong for the head.  Draw a \u201cpizza\u201d shape for the body outline.  Draw a three triangles attached to each other for the tail.  Draw curves connecting the head, body, and tail outlines.
