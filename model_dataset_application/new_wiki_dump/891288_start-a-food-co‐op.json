It\u2019s owned and operated by the very people who use it. It seeks to find and sell food for the lowest possible prices, while rejecting misleading marketing or shady sales practices. Membership is open to anyone and everyone."

Perhaps you want to be more involved in the community, or maybe you want to do your part to reduce harmful greenhouse gases by purchasing locally. Do you want to start a food co-op so that the people of your community have access to fresh, healthy produce? Whatever your reason, it\u2019s important to identify your purpose. This will be your driving force throughout a process that experts say takes a minimum of two years to do properly."

This core group of people needs to be as dedicated and passionate as you are to create this food co-op. It\u2019s a great idea to have people from different types of industries, if possible. For example, lawyers can help with the legal documents while business or finance-minded people can help with the financial aspects."

By gathering these facts and figures early, you will be able to create a plan moving forward.

Many, or even most, people are unaware of the special benefits of co-ops, and may not fully realize what the co-op can do for the community. Hold a meeting so that people can learn more, ask questions, and understand why they should support your co-op. Advertise the meeting everywhere! Then, come prepared with more information than you think you\u2019ll need. Be ready to explain what exactly a co-op is, the advantages of co-ops, common misunderstandings about them, and their financial and environmental benefits. Have informational pamphlets or flyers at the door for everyone to grab when they enter. People can follow along with these, and refer to them after the meeting is over. Welcome questions from your audience. Do your research before the meeting to ensure you can answer all of their questions, especially the questions that are specific to your town. If you aren\u2019t sure about a question, tell them to leave their email address so you can find an answer and let them know."

You can create an ongoing dialogue with these community members, updating them with the progress of the co-op and potentially getting your founding members. You can also begin reaching out to these interested community members for fundraising efforts.

If you allow your members to use payment plans to pay off their investment requirement, you won\u2019t raise a large sum of money in the beginning. This can make the start-up costs difficult or impossible to meet. For example, if you make your membership cost $150 and gather 100 members who pay outright, you will have earned $15,000 towards start-up costs. If you allow them to pay in increments of $50, you will only start out with $5,000. It can be helpful to give incentives to charter members who become members first and agree to pay their full membership fees outright."

These grants will have criteria for your co-op, from having a clear vision for your food co-op to being willing to match the grant amount through member investments. A Google search can help you find grants that will apply to your food co-op. There is help out there if you look around."

There is much more to a co-op than what initially meets the eye, and it\u2019s important to visualize your co-op in its entirety when planning your budget. Start with a modest staff, and you can hire more as your co-op takes off. Their pay will initially come from your start-up fees, and can increase as revenue increases. The key is to hire people who are passionate and engaged in the co-op\u2019s mission, and who understand how it works. You can also call for volunteers to work the food co-op, which will obviously save money."

Additionally, you need to be constantly talking with members to ensure you are purchasing the products they want and need. The inventory you buy and sell will most likely evolve as your food co-op gets up and running. As you learn what sorts of things sell and do not sell in your area, you can tailor your inventory. The most important thing, however, is that you are listening to the members to ensure that you are meeting their needs, and that you are making sure to bring them the best quality product for the lowest possible price."
