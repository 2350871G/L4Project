The flag is beautifully complex and can only be drawn by paying close attention to details, then executing them carefully. The flag has a background of three vertical bands \u2013 black, red, and green. Upon this field is centred an emblem of white consisting of:\nA wreath made of two sheaves of wheat crop wrapped in ribbon with a bow at the bottom. A mosque in the center of the wreath flanked by two flags. Four sets of Arabic text above and below the mosque. One of these is the \"Shahada.\" If you prefer, you can draw the emblem first, then color in the tricolor background. Settle on the approach you are going to use.

You can color the bands of black, red, and green, then paint the emblem with a white gel pen, water color, correction pen, or something similar. Alternatively, you can draw the emblem, then cut it out and stick it on another sheet upon which you coloured the bands. Drawing the Background (Field) Determine the dimensions of the flag. The flag is approximately 7/11 as high as it is wide. If the flag you want to draw is 18 centimeter (7.1 in) wide, it should be 11-12cm high. Draw the outline of the flag. Keep the flag height and width in proportion. Figure out the width of the bands. The width of the three vertical bands is equal and their size will determine the size of the emblem. If the bands are narrow, the size of the emblem will be reduced proportionately. Measure the breadth (width) of the flag with a ruler. To get the width of the bands, divide the breadth by 3. For example, if your flag is to be 18 centimeter (7.1 in) wide, make three equal bands each 6cm wide. Draw guidelines for the vertical bands. Measure and mark the top and bottom of each guideline, then use a ruler to join the two marks. Color the vertical bands. The black band on the left symbolises the painful past of Afghanistan. The red band in the middle symbolises the bloodshed of those who died for their freedom. The green band on the right represents hopes for peace in the future. Making the Emblem Make guiding dots. At the approximate center of the middle band, make a small dot followed by two dots above and beneath the central one. These three dots mark the borderline for the beginning, the middle and the end of the emblem. Mark the placement for the wheat sheaves. Make double marks on either side of the central or the red band. These mark the approximate area the sheaves will take. Make a few curved lines.
