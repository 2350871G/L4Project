However, there are just a few things to consider before beginning:\nShelled peanuts are much easier to use for peanut butter and baking recipes because you don't need to remove their shells later. If making peanut butter, use Spanish peanuts, which have higher oil content. If you wish, you can peel shelled peanuts' skins off with your fingers before beginning, though it's also easy to do this after roasting (see below). In-shell peanuts should be rinsed in cold water briefly to remove excess dirt. Pat dry with a paper towel and allow to dry for about five extra minutes on a wire rack."

Since you're using liquid ingredients here, lining your pan with foil or baking paper is a wise idea. Here, again, there are hundreds of possibilities. One easy classic example is honey-roasted peanuts. To make the glaze, just combine equal parts honey and melted butter and stir until uniform.

See our peanut butter recipe for step-by-step directions. As noted above, Spanish peanuts are best for this as they contain the most oil. You can use a food processor, a blender, or a manual solution like a mortar and pestle to get the peanuts to a smooth, creamy consistency. For chunky peanut butter, chop up a handful of peanuts and add them to the finished peanut butter. Some chefs like to add a dash of honey, molasses, salt, or other seasonings to their peanut butter for flavor. However, it should be fine on its own."
