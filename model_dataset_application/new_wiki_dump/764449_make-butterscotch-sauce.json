  "text":" Gathering Your Ingredients Go for unsalted, rather than salted, butter. Using unsalted butter is preferable because this way you can control how salty your sauce becomes.

Making the Sauce Take out a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place it on the stove and turn the stove to medium heat. Melt \u00bd cup butter in the saucepan. Keep an eye on the butter as it melts so it doesn't burn or brown. Add 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup heavy cream, and \u00bd tsp salt.
