For instance, if you have a set of bedsheets that you never use, donate them so you have more room for other items. If you store flashlights in your closet, you could check every few months to make sure that the batteries are still working."

If the clothing doesn\u2019t fit, you can place it in the donation or discard bag. If the clothing does still fit, ask yourself if you enjoy wearing each article of clothing.

See if there\u2019s a specific drop-off location or if the group is willing to pick up the donations from your home. If you don\u2019t want to give your belongings to a charity, you can also sell mint-condition items at a consignment shop. You can drop off items at organizations like the Red Cross. If you donate something especially expensive to charity, you may qualify for a tax deduction."

Wait an hour or so for the surfaces to dry completely before you place anything back in your closet. Start by cleaning the highest surfaces in your closet, then work your way to the bottom. This way, you won\u2019t spread extra dust to other portions of the closet. If your floor looks especially dusty, consider vacuuming it."

Use it if you need extra space to hang your clothes, coats, or other items.

Try to organize your hangers in a way that makes sense to you so you can easily access your garments later on. For instance, use color-coded hangers to sort your clothes by type. You could put dress shirts on pink hangers, vests on green hangers, and so on. You can also order your clothes by color (e.g., red, orange, yellow, etc.).
