Read each label carefully to ensure that you prolong the life of your clothes and don\u2019t damage them with improper care. If your garment does not have a care label, wash it in cold water only to avoid accidentally shrinking or damaging the fabric. If it is very old or expensive, it may be safer to assume that it is dry clean only."

          "description":"Fill a clean bucket or tub with warm water and 1 ounce (28 g) of detergent, and add any clothes you want to remove odors from. Let them sit for about 30 minutes. You can also add the juice of half a lemon to your pre-soak solution to help break up any body oils soaked into the fabric. Use cold water if your garment\u2019s care label indicates that it is cold-wash only."

This method works better when the garment has been pre-soaked, but it can still be effective without soaking. If you choose to skip the pre-soak, get the garment wet before scrubbing."

          "description":"Baking soda is frequently used as a deodorizer, and can help to draw the smells out of clothes. If you are using powdered detergent, add the baking soda along with it in the detergent tray. If you are using liquid detergent, add the baking soda to the wash basin after it\u2019s filled with water."

It is also more environmentally friendly than chlorine bleach and less corrosive to fabrics. Use it along with your normal detergent. While oxygenated bleach is generally considered color-safe, you shouldn\u2019t use it if your garment\u2019s care label says \u201cNo Bleach.\u201d"

Many household brands offer laundry detergents that contain Borax, which saves you the trouble of measuring and adding the Borax separately. Use it instead of your regular detergent, and combine it with an additive like oxygenated bleach or baking soda for especially smelly garments. If you can\u2019t find any Borax detergents, simply dissolve 4 ounces (110 g) of powdered Borax in hot water and add to a load along with your normal detergent. Wait until the wash basin has filled with water before adding the Borax solution."

Adding it during the rinse cycle will allow it to neutralize odors without lessening the effect of your laundry detergent. If you are dealing with particularly strong smells, add 1 cup (240 ml) of vinegar. For especially tenacious smells, try using this additive along with baking soda.
