          "description":"To see if your soup kitchen is accepting volunteers, simply call them a few weeks beforehand. Ask if there are any opportunities to help out on Thanksgiving Day, and whether you\u2019ll need to come in for any training beforehand. Not all soup kitchens and food banks accept volunteers around Thanksgiving and the holidays. Although they appreciate the help, sometimes they prefer to have only pre-trained, experienced volunteers working. If this is the case, see if you can help another way, such as by making a donation.Tip: If your soup kitchen doesn\u2019t need volunteers on Thanksgiving, ask about opportunities throughout the rest of the year. They often need more help during other seasons, even more so than during the holidays. If you train earlier in the year, you may be able to volunteer at Thanksgiving."

It can also help you feel more comfortable if you\u2019ve never volunteered to serve meals before. You can talk about the experience afterwards, discussing how you felt and what it was like to talk with people who might be dealing with poverty. Processing your feelings together can help you all get more out of your volunteering. Make sure to ask before you bring kids along."
