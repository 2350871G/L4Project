          "description":"Formal dinner invitations often arrive in the mail or through email. Regardless of how your invitation arrives, read the invitation carefully from top to bottom to figure out how you are supposed to respond. Formal invitations almost always include everything you need to know about accepting or reserving your seat. Formal invitations typically include the date, time, attire, and reservation method. Don\u2019t throw your invitation out if it arrived in the mail. You may need some of the information later! You may be required to reply to formal invitations via mail, email, telephone, or online. Check your calendar before responding to the invitation to ensure that you\u2019re free on that day."

          "description":"RSVP is short for r\u00e9pondez s'il vous plait, which is French for \u201cplease respond.\u201d It\u2019s a formal shorthand for the reservation instructions. If the invitation asks you to accept or decline using a specific method, do not use an alternative response method. In other words, it the invitation asks you to respond online, do not send a letter. If the invitation asks you to reply via email, do not call. It is generally seen as inappropriate to not follow the invitation\u2019s instructions. Tip: Some invitations will say \u201cRSVP, regrets only.\u201d This means that it is automatically assumed that you will attend and you only need to reach out if you can\u2019t make the dinner. If you see this printed on an invitation to a company event, it strongly implies that you need to attend."

          "description":"If the invitation lists a website for RSVPs, get on your computer and type in the website\u2019s address. On the website, look for a button that says \u201cAccept,\u201d or, \u201cI Am Attending.\u201d Click this button and enter any additional information that pop up for menu options or guest information. Online reservation sites are designed to be easy to use. It shouldn\u2019t be too hard to accept the invitation digitally. If you struggle with navigating the website, contact the website before reaching out to the host. Their servers may be down or you may not understand the instructions. If you can\u2019t make the event, politely decline before the RSVP date. Send a note or let the host know in person that you\u2019re sorry you can\u2019t show up."

          "description":"If the host requests an email or letter reply, start with a formal salutation like, \u201cDear Mr. Jankowski.\u201d Then, thank the host for the invitation and plainly state that you accept their invitation. Written replies don\u2019t need to be longer than 1-3 sentences, so don\u2019t worry about writing a long acceptance speech. If you are allowed to bring a guest, mention who you are bringing at the end of your response. For example, you may write, \u201cThank you for the lovely invitation to your annual dinner party. I am deeply honored and happy to accept your kind invitation. I will be bringing my partner, Taylor Walters.\u201d\nClose your email with \u201cSincerely,\u201d or \u201cThank you,\u201d followed by your name. Include your title if you\u2019re responding to an invitation by a colleague or business organization. If you\u2019re emailing your response and the dinner is hosted by someone you have a professional relationship with, use your professional email account. If it\u2019s a personal friend, use your personal email account. If you\u2019re mailing your response, handwrite your response on a sheet of nice cardstock or paper. Include your signature instead of writing your name out. Invitations that require a written response typically include a blank response card with the invitation."

Since you don\u2019t have a personal relationship with the venue or event organizer, you really don\u2019t need to worry about following etiquette. Kindly state that you will be attending the dinner, provide your name, and thank the person on the other end of the phone before hanging up. It is exceptionally rare that you need to call the host directly to accept a dinner invitation. If the host does answer the phone, be cordial and say something like, \u201cHello! This is Alfred O'Brian. I\u2019m calling to thank you for the invitation and to let you know that I will be attending your dinner on the 9th.\u201d Answer any follow-up questions and thank the host again before hanging up."

These types of invitations are often open offers where the host doesn\u2019t need information on who will be attending. You typically get invitations like these from organizations or groups. If the letter is impersonal and looks like it could be sent to anybody, it\u2019s probably fine to show up without actively accepting the offer."
