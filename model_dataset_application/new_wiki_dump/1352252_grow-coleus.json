          "headline":"Keep the soil moist.",
          "description":"Water the seeds lightly but frequently, so the soil remains moist without becoming soggy. If the plants are kept in an arid environment, cover the trays or pots with plastic wrap to prevent them drying out. To water seedlings in small pots, soak the pot in water. The water will work its way up into the soil. This is less disruptive to the young plants. Remove the plastic wrap as soon as you see seedlings emerge."

Cuttings are also available for purchase directly, and typically come with a small root ball already developed. You may take cuttings 2\u20133 in. (5\u20137.5 cm) from smaller coleus species."

To counteract this, cover the entire pot and coleus cutting with a large plastic bag, to trap moisture in the air. Use sticks or toothpicks to prevent the plastic bag from touching the cutting directly. Remove the bag once you notice new growth on the coleus, typically after 1\u20134 weeks."

Once the plant has developed roots and foliage, you can continue caring for it using the instructions below. You may keep it as an indoor plant, or transfer it to your garden if you live in a hot climate. Cuttings purchased from a nursery are typically greenhouse-raised, and not used to full sun. Transfer them outside gradually, moving the pot from areas of heavy shade to sunnier areas."

Dig a hole that is twice the size of your root ball, and plant it at the same depth that it was planted in the pot. Replace the soil around the plant.

Otherwise, keep your coleus in partial shade. If your coleus is dropping leaves, it probably needs more sun. USDA Hardiness zones vary slightly by species and variety, but most coleus plants thrive in zones 9\u201310, if they are kept indoors in winter and outdoors the rest of the year."

In very hot or windy conditions, you may need to water daily or even twice daily to keep the soil moist. Increase the amount of watering if you notice wilting, dry brown spots, or fading color.

Fertilizer can promote straggly or weak growth, so use one of the following options to keep it to beneficial levels:\nApply a timed-release fertilizer according to instructions, just once each growing season. Or dilute a liquid fertilizer to \u00bd or \u00bc strength, and apply once every 2 weeks."

Here are the basic pruning strategies commonly used for coleus:\nTo encourage coleus to grow straight, pinch off the side branches, but not the leaves growing directly on the stem. Do this if you want a more \"treelike\" appearance, instead of a wide bush. Once the coleus has reached the desired height, pinch off the top center shoot on the plant, to encourage it to fill out and become bushy."
