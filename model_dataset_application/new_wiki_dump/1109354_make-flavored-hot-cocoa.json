Choose high grade quality cocoa (dark Dutch cocoa is a superb choice). Cocoa can often be purchased from quality grocery stores or from online sellers. Alternatively, melt quality dark chocolate for a gooey, rich and velvety tasting hot chocolate. Use the best quality cream and sugar."

Some minty flavoring suggestions include:\nAdd 1 tablespoon of mint chocolate chips to every cup of hot cocoa. Crush a peppermint candy cane (or other mint candy). Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of crushed peppermint candy on top of the hot chocolate. It will sink and melt into the drink. Finish with a dollop of whipped cream. Add 1 tablespoon of peppermint extract.

This can be done easily to make your regular hot chocolate even better:\nMelt 1 cup of white chocolate chips into 6 cups of hot whole milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract for a white hot chocolate. Make hot chocolate fudge by adding a huge chunk of fudge or a brownie at the bottom of the cup, add hot chocolate and top with homemade whipped cream and chocolate shavings. You'll need to provide a long stemmed spoon to help eat up the mushy delight at the base. And be aware, that this isn't to everyone's taste. Get a little nutty by combining 2 tablespoons of Nutella to 1 cup of hot chocolate. Allow the Nutella to melt and combine to create a nutty/chocolatey flavor. Enhance the chocolate flavor of your hot cocoa by drizzling caramel sauce over the top of your cup."

Add 1 tablespoon of canned pumpkin and 1 teaspoon of brown sugar to regular hot chocolate recipe. Top with crushed graham crackers and whipped cream. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of cinnamon into the hot chocolate and add a cinnamon stick to each cup for stirring.

Mix raspberry and chocolate by adding 1 tablespoon of good raspberry preserve to your hot cocoa. Top with whipped cream and a fresh raspberry. Or try making strawberry and raspberry hot chocolate. Make orange hot chocolate. Add 1/2 teaspoon orange extract and a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla essence to the hot chocolate. Add grated dark chocolate as a topping and stir with a cinnamon stick. Make banana hot chocolate. Add 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of sugar to the hot chocolate. Mash 1 banana. Place both the banana and the hot chocolate into a blender and combine quickly to make smooth.
