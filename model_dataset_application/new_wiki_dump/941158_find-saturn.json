Saturn is visible for at least part of every year when Earth passes between Saturn and the Sun. Depending on the time of year and the relation of our planets, Saturn may be easier or more difficult to locate in the night sky."

          "description":"If you want to locate Saturn, it would be difficult to just point your telescope into the sky and start blindly sweeping around. You have to know where to look, as well as what to look for. Consult a star chart that displays the path of Saturn and pick a time that it will be nearest a recognizable constellation. Starting in 2014, Saturn can be seen close to the constellation Libra, moving on later that year to Scorpius. In may of 2015, Saturn will retrograde, meaning it will move from East to West, back toward Libra. This would be a prime viewing opportunity to find Saturn. Over the next ten years, Saturn will move steadily East in the sky of the Northern hemisphere, toward Capricornus. During a period of 2017, Saturn will become invisible to stargazers from Earth, as it will be too close to the Sun for us to see it."

During its oppositional period, Saturn will be due South in the Northern hemisphere and due North in the Southern hemisphere, most visible around midnight, local time. Oppositional dates from 2014-2022 are:\nMay 10, 2014\nMay 23, 2015\nJune 3, 2016\nJune 15, 2017\nJune 27, 2018\nJuly 9, 2019\nJuly 20, 2020\nAugust 2, 2021\nAugust 14, 2022"

Consider splitting the cost of a good one with some other astronomers and sharing the use of it. To view Saturn, a basic telescope would be more than sufficient for the beginner. If you want to get fancy, though, NexStar features telescope in the $800 range that locate objects in the sky for you by programming them in, while a professional 11-inch Schmidt Cassegrain runs in the neighborhood of $1,200.
