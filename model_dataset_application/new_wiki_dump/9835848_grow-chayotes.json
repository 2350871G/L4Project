Natural pollinators should naturally pollinate the flowers, but on days where there is little pollination activity, you could hand pollinate them using a soft-bristled paintbrush to transfer pollen from the male flowers onto the female flowers.

  "text":" Sprouting the Chayote Buy a chayote fruit. Unlike most other members of the Cucurbitaceae family, the seed of the chayote will refuse to grow if it is separated from the fruit.
