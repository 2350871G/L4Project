However, the last thing you want is to buy far too many plants and then realize you don\u2019t have room for all of them! Remember, when you are measuring, that you probably don\u2019t want plants to cover your entire balcony so work conservatively to the space you have. Using buckets or plates to act as indicators of how large a garden pot will be is a good idea here."

Some plants start small and grow to be very large, others start large and don\u2019t grow at all. When you buy plants, make sure you check with a store-clerk or the information section to see how large the plant will grow to be and that your balcony can handle that size.
