All you have to do is put your chips on the pass line on the table. You'll be able to tell were that is because it will say 'Pass Line' in big letters. You can make the Pass Line bet on a come out roll, which is designated by a black marker on the table that says \u2018off\u2019. If you see a black marker on the table with the word 'off' on it then you'll know you are allowed to make your bet. You win even money if the come out roll (when the black marker is on the table) is a 7 or an 11 and you lose if it is a 2, 3 or 12. If any other number is rolled that number becomes the \u2018point\u2019 and person rolling the dice continues rolling until they hit a 7 or that number that the rolled the first time again. The point is the term for the number you want to roll again. If a 7 comes first, you lose. If the other number comes first, you win. Even money means that if you put one dollar down you win one dollar. Do not make a Pass Line bet after the come out roll. Your odds of winning go down."

You lose on all the other numbers. These bets can be made at any time before the subsequent roll. On many tables 2 and 12 pay you double your money.

For example, if you choose Snake Eyes you're betting that two one's will be rolled on the very next roll. There are a number of proposition bets that change depending on what casino you\u2019re playing in and in what country. Some common bets include Snake Eyes (you win if the shooter rolls a 2), Any seven (you win if a 7 is rolled), and hi-lo (you win if the shooter rolls a 2 or a 12). Proposition bets have very low odds and are not considered a good bet for the player."

Rolling in pairs means that the same number has to appear on each of the die. So to get a 6 you would have to roll two threes."
