The boiling will loosen the tomato skins, and the ice bath will stop the cooking process. Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Use a small pot if you're just peeling a few tomatoes, and a larger pot if you have many tomatoes to peel. The blanching method is very effective, and it works well when you have to peel many tomatoes."

Place the ice bath near the stove, so the tomatoes won\u2019t have far to go when you remove them from the boiling water. A small bowl of ice water will do if you're just peeling a few tomatoes. For larger batches of tomatoes, use a larger bowl filled with ice and water."

If you don\u2019t have metal tongs, pierce the tomato with a fork where you removed the stem.
