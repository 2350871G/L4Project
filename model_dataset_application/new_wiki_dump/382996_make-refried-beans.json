The bigger decision, of course, is which beans to use:\n\nPinto beans are the classic choice. Sweet but savory, with a good size for mashing and a creamy texture, they are the top refried beans. Black beans are slightly courser, without the sweet notes of pinto beans, which can lead to a somewhat more muted flavor that compliments many flavors well without overpowering. Navy, cannellini, and white beans can all be used for delicious refried beans, though they won't be \"classic\" by any stretch. They tend to have a lighter flavor and creamy texture, but are all open for culinary experiments."

The type of fat you use will greatly impact the flavor of your final dish, so choose wisely:\n\nLard: the \"king\" of refried bean fats, this is the most common fat used to cook the beans. Pork fat, in particular, is a spectacular choice. Bacon drippings: the second-most common fat in recipes, as it is readily available and lends a rich, smokey flavor to the beans. Can be mixed or cut with vegetable oil. Vegetable or Canola oil: these mild oils will allow the flavors of your spices, beans, and onions to shine through. Don't use high-flavor oils like olive or truffle unless you want those flavors in the beans -- which most cooks don't.
