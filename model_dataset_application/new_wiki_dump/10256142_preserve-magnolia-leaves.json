You can reuse the mixture for preserving other leaves or flowers."

Use a pair of scissors to cut the leaves away from the branch, and crush or cut the stem of the leaf with your scissors to increase absorption. Where you\u2019ll cut the leaves from the branches depends on what you\u2019re using them for.

Leave any leaves that aren\u2019t yet golden-brown in the water for an additional 1-2 days. The leaves should be flexible when you pull them out of the bath, so bend them back and forth a few times to ensure that they don\u2019t break. If the first leaf that you try bending does break, keep the rest of the leaves in the bath for another day to absorb more glycerin. If you're glycerizing a larger branch with leaves on it, the process can take up to 2-3 weeks, and you will need to replace the glycerin bath after each week to ensure that there is enough glycerin available."

When you aren\u2019t using your leaves, store them in a resealable plastic bag or airtight container in a dark, dry place. Since the leaves are soft and pliable, you don\u2019t need to worry about breaking or crumbling when using or storing them."
