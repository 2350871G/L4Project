          "description":"Shake the bag a little to let the chips settle at the bottom of your bag. Set your bag of chips on its back so that the label is facing up. Smooth down the top portion of the bag 3-4 times until its flat. Work from the bottom of the bag to the top to remove the excess air from the bag. This method is easy, but it won\u2019t keep the air out unless you store the opening under a heavy item. The more air there is the bag, the faster your chips will become stale."

The more folds you make, the more likely the bag is to unravel though. Press down along the top of the bag after each fold to keep it closed."

To keep the folds from unraveling over time, place a vase, bowl, or something heavy on top of the folds to keep them weighed down. Your folds may slowly come undone if you don\u2019t weigh them down at all."

You\u2019ll also need more of the bag to be empty, so you may not be able to do this if your bag is mostly full. This method is really hard to pull off if you have a smaller bag of chips.
