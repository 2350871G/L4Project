          "description":"There are several tools you can use to measure length, but the right tool will depend on the unit system you plan to use and the size of the length you wish to measure. Rulers are stiff, straight edges with graduated markings. Typically, one side has markings for inches and the other side has markings for centimeters. These tools are good to use for relatively short lengths. Tape measures are flexible straight edges with graduated markings. Since most tape measures only measure one unit system (U.S. customary or metric), you'll need to find one that uses the unit system you need. Since these tools can bend, they're good to use when measuring the total length of an object that exists in more than one dimension (e.g., waist measurements, the circumference of a wood block, etc.). Meter sticks and yard sticks are similar in construction and length. Both are stiff straight edges with graduated markings. Meter sticks measure all lengths up to 1 meter (or 100 cm), and yard sticks measure all lengths up to 1 yard (or 3 feet). Odometers are tools that measure long lengths traveled by vehicles, like cars and bicycles. Pedometers measure long lengths traveled by a human or other living creature as it walks. These tools are good for measuring miles and kilometers, but they are calibrated by professionals and work without hands-on involvement from the user."

Make sure that you write down the unit of measurement along with the whole number. When the edge lands between two whole numbers, use the lesser of the two values. For instance, if the edge of a measured length falls between 5 inches and 6 inches, use 5 inches for your measurement."

          "headline":"Count the lines after that number.",
          "description":"Count the total number of lines in between whole number sets, then count the exact number of lines existing between the largest whole number and the ending edge of the object to be measured. Mark these numbers down. The number of lines between whole number sets should be consistent for the entire tool. When using the metric system, there will usually be 9 lines (10 spaces) between whole numbers. When using the U.S. standard system, there will usually be 3 lines (4 spaces), 7 lines (8 spaces), or 15 lines (16 spaces). Count the number of lines exactly. If the edge falls between two lines, round up or down based on which line the edge lies closest to. For instance, if there are 7 lines (8 spaces) between sets on the ruler and your edge lands closer to the third line than the second line, use the third line. This would give you 3/8 inch (use the number of spaces for the denominator, not the number of lines)."

Compare the results when finished. If the results differ from your first measurement, continue re-measuring until you find two matching measurements."
