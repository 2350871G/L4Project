Follow the wire of the first paper clip around until the two paper clips are connected at closed ends. Continue connecting the remainder of your paper clips in this manner until all of them are connected into a long chain. Clip the last and first paper clips together to make the chain into a closed necklace. You can also use this method to create a paper clip bracelet. Simple use fewer paper clips to create a shorter chain."

Wrapped Candy Necklace[2]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Open a bag of wrapped candies. Think of something like salt water taffy or peppermints. You can use either hard or soft candy, depending on your preference, as long as the candies are securely wrapped. Colorful wrappers tend to be more fun and appealing to kids. Overlap the end of one wrapper with the end of another. The two overlapping ends should only consist of the paper or plastic wrapper and not the candy. Staple the overlapping ends together. Lightly tug on the two pieces of candy to confirm that they are secured together. Continue overlapping and stapling the wrappers. Repeat the process until you have a long enough chain to slip over your child's head. Secure the first and last pieces of candy together with a staple to create a closed loop. You can also create a smaller chain for a bracelet by using fewer candies. Monitor you child after giving him or her the necklace. While the necklace is certainly a real \"treat,\" it can be problematic in a number of ways. For starters, eager kids may be tempted to eat all the candy at once instead of taking their time going through it. The staples also present a threat to younger kids who may not be vigilant about what goes in their mouths. You can use a candy necklace as a type of reward system. When your child does something positive, like making her bed or sharing a valued toy with a sibling, reward the child by granting permission to eat a piece of candy from the necklace. Daisy Chain Necklace[3]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Get a bouquet of daisies or daisy chrysanthemums. Daisy mums are considerably sturdier than actual daisies, and they tend to last longer than daisies when kept out of water. If you want something a little more traditional, however, you can still use real daisies. Cut the stems to about 4 inches (10 cm). Use scissors or a sharp knife. Anything longer will make the necklace look sparse of blooms, but anything shorter may not be sturdy enough to hold together. Slice into each stem. Use scissors or a knife to cut a 1 in. (2.5 cm) slit toward the bottom of each stem, but not through the bottom. The slit needs to be closed on both ends, rather than hanging open. Slip one flower stem through the slit in a second stem. Slide the stem all the way through the slit until the base of the bloom sits at the entrance of the slit. Slip the stem of a third flower into the slit of the first. At this point, there should be three flowers, and two slits should have stems poking through them. Continue weaving the flower stems together in this manner. Keep going until you have enough flowers to make a chain that can fit over your child's head. Make a second slip in the stem of the first flower. The first flower is the flower at the start of the chain. Slip the stem of the last flower through this second slit to close the loop. Reinforce the stems with twine. Wrap and tie a small piece of twine around each stem, where the flowers connect, to make the chain more secure. Rock Necklace Place a small rock in the center of a piece of wire. Use coated, colored wire and select a piece that is about 15 in. (38 cm) in length. Wrap the wire around the rock. Do not use the entire piece of wire, though. Wind the wire around the rock several times, just enough to secure the rock in place. Twist the ends of the wire together. Twist the ends tightly until the remaining wire is used up. Wrap the twisted ends around a pencil. Only wrap the twist around the pencil once in order to form a loop. Close the loop by squeezing it shut with a pair of excess wire. Trim away extra wire. Since the loop is only the width of your pencil, there will likely be some excess wire hanging off of it. Cut this extra wire away, making it as short as possible to prevent it from scratching the child who wears the necklace. Cut a piece of leather cord. Make the piece long enough to fit over your child's head. You can choose brown leather cord for a natural look, or you can use colored leather cord for something a little more fun. Slip the leather cord through the wire loop. The cord acts as the chain, and the rock becomes the necklace pendant. Tie the ends of the cord into a tight knot before giving it to your child.",
