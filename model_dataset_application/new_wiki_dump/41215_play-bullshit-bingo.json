You can also add \"Wild\" spots to your grid if anyone in your game can't quite come up with enough words to fill the grid. Some players share a pool of collective cliches, but select where on their grid they want them to be listed. Shared words eliminate part of the skill aspect of the game though."

You and your fellow players may want to decide on a funny double-entendre or inside joke that the winner will need to utter in order to declare victory. Another option is to have the winner speak and incorporate all of their winning cliches. It can require a fair bit of creativity and is hilarious."
