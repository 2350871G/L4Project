          "description":"Take some time to think about the main function of the living room. Do you have kids that need space to play? Do you plan on hosting a lot of parties? Does your living room have a large window with a great view? The function of the room should be the main influence in how you design it. If your living room has a natural focal point, such as a fireplace or a view, consider designing around it. Face the seating towards the focal point so that everyone in the room has a clear view. Add rotating armchairs so you can easily adapt the room to a space for entertaining. If there isn\u2019t a natural focal point, decide how to create one. For example, you can use a large piece of furniture, a brightly-colored wall, a piece of art. Some living rooms are large enough to split into two or more areas. If you have a large living room, and you need a space for kids to play, consider devoting a part of the room to a play area. Use a coffee table or sofa to create a natural divide between areas."

Keep plants and other room accents away from the entryways as well. You don't want your guests to have to fight past anything to enter the room. Leaving clearance around the entryway also makes the room more inviting."

When designing the living room, you have complete control over how guests will move through the room. Sim to leave 3 feet (0.91 m) of space between furniture and walls so people can easily walk through the room. Pay attention to any doorways in the living room. Don\u2019t put furniture in front of a door, even if it\u2019s not usually used, as this creates an awkward feeling. If you have one doorway along a wall, then group your furniture in the area along the opposite wall. Two doors across from each other create a natural divide in the room, allowing you to split the room into 2 distinct areas. If you have several doorways to work with, you can split the room into multiple areas, each with a specific emphasis."

Choose furniture that is proportionate to the space and colors that are appropriate for the scale of the room. For example, don\u2019t fill a small room with large, dark furniture. Pick smaller, light-colored pieces instead. Think about the emphasis of the room and how much space you have to work with. If you need extra seating in a small space, consider a combination of floating chairs and sofas. Being able to move the chairs allows you to remain flexible. If you have a lot of empty space in your room, incorporate it into your design. A big open room can be welcoming. Whatever you do, keep the room balanced."

Try to blend several layers of light from multiple sources. Use a combination of ceiling lights, table lamps, sconces, and floor lamps to achieve balanced lighting in your living room.

Check in your area for high-school art shows. You may find some pieces you like at a reasonable price. For a more personal touch, create a gallery wall of family photographs.
