          "description":"While you do not need to major in photojournalism, or journalism at all, to get in with Nat Geo, you do need a college degree. Though your degree can be in something completely unrelated to photojournalism, it is encouraged that you take photography classes and practice constantly. Many Nat Geo photographers use their educational backgrounds to help them with shooting. For example, numerous freelancers have solid science backgrounds, which makes them excellent photographers of natural history."

          "description":"Some National Geographic photographers started their careers at local newspapers or magazines as staff photographers. Since National Geographic requires its freelancers to have at least half a decade of professional experience, it is important to find a job that allows you to take pictures every day. Joel Sartore, a photographer for National Geographic, began his career as a photographer and later director of photography for a newspaper in Wichita, Kansas."

          "description":"In this field, you are competing with veteran photographers, accomplished documentarians, and gifted storytellers. It is not enough to just be a great photographer. You have to be an expert in something specific, like camping in the tropics for days at a time or speaking Russian or getting the perfect lighting in difficult-to-photograph areas. It is a tall order to bring something to the table Nat Geo hasn\u2019t already seen. The more specific your skill is, the better chance you have of catching the attention of the editors at the company. Versatility is also key. People who speak multiple languages are valuable to the publication, as are people who can dive under sea ice. If you can master vastly different skills, you\u2019ve made yourself that much more attractive to the editors at National Geographic."

          "headline":"Take pictures every single day.",
          "description":"This may seem obvious, but it is incredibly important. In order to reach this level of the industry, you need to eat, sleep and breathe photography. Take pictures every day and know every single thing there is to know about your camera. Photography is not a cheap hobby but owning different types of cameras can help you become an even better photographer. National Geographic doesn\u2019t require a specific type of camera for their shoots, so the more cameras you are comfortable handing, the better. Nat Geo encourages photographers to shoot using experimental styles and techniques. However, the company does not want photos that are heavily-edited or manipulated. Make it a goal to become as good at capturing your vision with the initial photo as possible."

Once they see someone\u2019s name over and over again, they will look to get in contact with them. This process can take time. After all, Nat Geo is looking for veteran photographers, so keep at it! As a former director of photography at National Geographic used to say: \u201cIf we want to hire you, we already know who you are!\u201d\nWhen Nat Geo editors reach out, they are usually looking to see if you have good story ideas. Take some time every day to think about stories you would like to tell. The more important the story is to you, the easier it will be for you to tell it to the world."

Look up a photographer you admire to see when and where that person will be speaking next. Stay after the talk to introduce yourself, as nothing beats an in-person introduction! Networking isn\u2019t just about finding the people who can hire you for your dream job. It\u2019s about building relationships and getting feedback on your work.

In order to keep their attention, you must consistently send them your best work. Doing so just once most likely isn\u2019t good enough. Joel Sartore sent his work to National Geographic\u2019s Washington D.C. headquarters every three months. This eventually led to a one-day assignment with the magazine, which was soon followed by more work. There is a delicate balance to sending your work to Nat Geo. Being persistent is a good thing, but being a pain is not.

Early career grants are meant to give less-experienced photographers a chance to lead a project. An exploration grant is a funding request made by an experienced project leader in the areas of education, conservation, storytelling, research, and technology. A request for proposal is when an applicant pitches a project that focuses on a certain key issue. These include documenting human migration and species recovery. You must be at least 18 years old to apply for an early career grant. Grant projects last one calendar year or less. Early career grants are typically funded for 5,000 dollars and cannot exceed 10,000 dollars. Exploration grants feature between 10,000 and 30,000 dollars in funding. You can apply for a Nat Geo grant even if you have already applied for one in the past. All you have to do is close your previous grant record. The grant program is highly competitive and Nat Geo receives far more applications than it can fund."
