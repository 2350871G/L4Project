This is a great way to make your room appear larger, since the columns won\u2019t break up the room visually. If the columns are in the middle of a room, paint them the color of the wall that they\u2019re closest to. For instance, if your walls are a light shade of blue, you could paint the columns that color as well."

          "description":"To draw attention to your columns, try painting them a color that contrasts (but still complements) the walls. That way, your eye will be drawn to the columns when you look around the room. If your walls are cream-colored, for instance, you might paint the walls a rich, warm shade of brown. If they\u2019re light grey, you might opt for a darker slate color instead. If you have an accent wall, consider painting the columns that color to tie the room together."

          "description":"White and cream columns have a stately look, because they bring to mind the classic marble columns in Grecian and Roman architecture. No matter what style of columns you have, or what other colors you\u2019re using in your home, painting the columns white will instantly make your home look more upscale. Opt for a cool white if your other decor is mostly cool shades, like blues and teals. On the other hand, stick to warm whites and creams if the rest of your home is decorated in warm hues like pinks, corals, and yellows."

          "description":"For the most part, it will be easiest to paint your columns with a paintbrush. You can use any brush you like, but a 2 \u20442\u20133 in (6.4\u20137.6 cm) brush is ideal for most interior home projects. Work in small sections, always applying new paint to the wet edge that you just finished painting. Let the paint dry completely, then add a second coat if it's needed. If you're using latex or water-based paint, use a paintbrush with synthetic bristles. For oil-based paint, use a natural-bristled brush. If you have a wide, square column, you can use a roller if you like. However, narrow or round columns need to be painted with a brush to get a neat, even application."

          "description":"If you want a closer replication of marble, use a brush to paint the entire column a solid color. Then, use a sponge to dab a slightly lighter shade over the original color, followed by a layer of a slightly darker color. When you\u2019re finished, the column will have a subtle marble effect. This technique does not produce the veined look of real marble, but it\u2019s still a nice way to dress up an interior column."

Cut 4 pieces of lumber (3 for a flush-mounted column) that are long enough to reach from the floor to the ceiling. Place the first 2 planks flush on parallel sides of the column, and space nails vertically along the center to secure the wood in place. Repeat for the remaining planks. Once you've built the box, you can then paint, stain, or distress the wood however you like.

Drill a small rectangular hole in the center of the column at about eye level, then attach the sconce to the column with screws or brackets, and hook up the wires. If you're not comfortable working with electricity, you may want to hire a certified electrician to assist you. Turn off the power to the room you'll be working before you do any electrical work.

It typically comes in panels that you nail or screw into the column, and essentially changes the material that the column appears to be made from. You can cover your column in cork, plaster, wood, slate, vinyl, or even metals like brass. This is a great way to dress up a simple drywall column in your home."

If you\u2019re decorating for the winter holidays, try a lush green garland, then wrap small pieces of wire around the garland and hang ornaments from the wire.
