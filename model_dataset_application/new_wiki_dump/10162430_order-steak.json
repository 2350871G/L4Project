It contains 2 different types of meat: a strip steak on one side and a tenderloin on the other, so it can give you 2 flavors and 2 textures in 1 cut of meat. The T-bone is usually a little more expensive than other cuts of meat and can be trickier to cook well because of the different types of meat on it."

          "description":"Order this option for a cut that is larger than the T-bone but similar in flavor and texture. The porterhouse also contains both a strip steak and a tenderloin, but it comes from the legs area of an animal. The USDA states that the tenderloin portion of the porterhouse steak must be at least 1.25 inches (3.2 cm) at the widest point."

          "description":"Don\u2019t be afraid of fat in your steak\u2014the fat is actually what provides the most flavor in any given cut of meat. This cut comes from the rib area of the animal. The rib eye is tender and flavorful and juicy, thanks to the fat content. Because of the fat content, this cut of steak gets a little more charred and crispy and smoky when it cooks. While it\u2019s cooking, the dripping fat tends to catch fire or burn faster and creates a very flavorful crust on the steak."

          "headline":"Get a filet mignon for the most tender cut of meat.",
          "description":"This is one of the thickest cuts of meat, and it\u2019s popular because of how rich and tender it is. It\u2019s usually the most expensive option on a menu at a steakhouse and is also usually the smallest portion size. The flavor of the filet mignon is mild compared to that of other cuts, so it is often wrapped in bacon or paired with a sauce. Choose this option if you prefer soft, tender meat over robust flavor. The filet mignon is also sometimes called a tenderloin, but it is actually cut from a particular section of the tenderloin."

          "headline":"Select a top sirloin for rich flavor without a lot of fat.",
          "description":"This cut comes from near the rear of the animal, right underneath where the tenderloin is cut from. It\u2019s a more muscular cut but is also very flavorful. Order the top sirloin if you want a more affordable cut of meat that still retains the meaty flavor of steak. Tip: when cutting into a top sirloin, cut against the grain of the meat rather than with it."

        {
          "headline":"Opt for a strip steak for a consistently reliable cut of meat.",
          "description":"The strip steak is a tender, thinner cut of meat from the short loin of the animal, from right behind the rib area. It\u2019s not a muscular piece of meat so it is easy to cut. It\u2019s normally a longer piece of meat and can be ordered boneless or bone-in. The strip steak is a great option if you like a more well-done cook on your meat. Since it\u2019s thin, it cooks faster and is less likely to burn."
