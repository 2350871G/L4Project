Without adding a space, write down the file and rank of the square where the piece ends its movement. You do not need to include the file and rank for the square where the piece started the turn. For example, if you move your queen to the square in the 4th rank and the e file, write down Qd4 for your notation. In this example, Q represents the queen, d refers to the vertical file, and 4 indicates the horizontal rank. When you move a pawn, just write down the file and rank of the square where it moves. For example, if you move the pawn on the e file into the 3rd rank, you would write e3. If you have 2 of the same piece that could make the same move, then list the file or rank of where it started. For example, if you have a rook at a1 and another rook at h1, write down Rhe1 so you know the rook in the h file was the one that moved to the e1 square."

According to Chess Grandmaster Sahaj Grover: \"It's important to record your moves because otherwise, there's no provision to know what your position is. If someone bumps the table and the pieces fall off, it's just your word against your opponent's word on what the position actually was.

But if you have a notation pad, it tells you exactly which moves you played and which position you're at. Annotating Special Moves Put an \u201cx\u201d after the piece\u2019s symbol to indicate a capture. If you move onto the same space as one of your opponent\u2019s pieces, remove it from the board and place your piece there. Write down the letter symbol for the piece that you moved followed by an \u201cx\u201d to show that you captured a piece. Then list the square where your piece ended its move.

You do not need to list the symbol for the piece you captured. Write \u201co-o\u201d or \u201co-o-o\u201d if you castle on the kingside or queenside respectively. Castling refers to moving your king 2 squares horizontally toward one of your rooks, and then placing the closest rook on the opposite side of the king. If you castle with the rook that\u2019s closest to your king, then write \u201co-o\u201d in your notation. If you castle with the rook closest to the queen, then use \u201co-o-o\u201d instead. You do not need to include the ranks or files in your notation. You can only castle if you haven\u2019t moved your king or rook. Include \u201c=\u201d and a piece\u2019s symbol if a pawn gets promoted. If you\u2019re able to get one of your pawns to the other side of the chessboard, then you can promote it to a different piece. After the standard file and rank of the square, add \u201c=\u201d followed by the symbol of the piece you to promote the pawn to. For example, if a player moved their pawn into the 8th rank in the b file and chose to promote it to a queen, you would write b8=Q. In this example, b8 refers to the square in the b file in the 8th rank, and =Q refers to changing the piece to a queen.Tip: Usually, players promote the pawn to a queen since it\u2019s the most powerful piece, but you can choose any piece you want.
