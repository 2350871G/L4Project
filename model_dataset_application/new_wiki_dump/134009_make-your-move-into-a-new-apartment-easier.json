      "description":"A move isn\u2019t something you can simply prepare for over a weekend. Always plan ahead and never start packing the day before, as you\u2019ll find that you have a lot more stuff than you initially thought. Make sure all of your boxes are labelled appropriately \u2013 it will save you a lot of hassle when you\u2019re unpacking if you know what box goes in what room."

      "headline":"Donate your old junk.",
      "description":"In the process of packing, you might discover that you no longer need, like, or have room for old clothes, furniture and knick-knacks. Don\u2019t toss that stuff away, though \u2013 donate it to a worthy cause, such as Goodwill, the Salvation Army or the Canadian Diabetes Association. It\u2019s a win-win situation \u2013 you\u2019ll have fewer things to haul over to your new apartment and you get to help a charitable organization in the process. Plus, you might get a receipt for your donation, which you can use to lower the amount of taxable income you have to claim on your next tax return. You could also sell them or have a garage sale if it's easiest."

    {
      "headline":"Rent a van or truck.",
      "description":"A nice, empty apartment awaits you, but there\u2019s just one problem \u2013 you still have to get all of your stuff over there. Unless you have friends or family with large vans or trucks who are willing to help out, chances are you\u2019re going to have to rent one from a company such as U-Haul or find a man and van service. Demand for these vehicles is always high, especially between April and October, so it\u2019s always a good idea to book out a van or truck several weeks in advance. Wait until the last minute and you might discover they don\u2019t have any trucks available, and if they do, they might not be available during the time you had hoped to make the move."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Get some help.",
      "description":"Ideally, you should recruit a personal army of friends and family to help you move, as the only cost you\u2019ll have to pay might be pitching in for a pizza after everything is done. However, what do you do if all of your friends are busy or out of town? Unless your idea of a fun weekend is hauling box after box into your new apartment all by yourself, perhaps it\u2019s best to hire the services of a moving company. Whether you need them to do the entire move for you, or you just need them to help you load up the truck, a moving company has well-trained staff and all of the necessary equipment that will keep your valuables intact and make your move fast and hassle-free. Be sure to check the insurance policies of the moving company you hire \u2013 some offer different levels of coverage than others. You may want to invest in some form of moving insurance, especially if you have lots of rare and breakable items that could get damaged during a move."

      "headline":"Hold the elevator.",
      "description":"Regardless of what floor you\u2019re moving into to, getting all of your items up to your new apartment \u2013 especially those big pieces of furniture \u2013 isn\u2019t going to be easy. Luckily, most apartments have large service elevators that can be used specifically for this purpose. However, during the busy times of the year, a lot of people are going to want to use those elevators at the same time. That\u2019s why it\u2019s wise to get those elevators booked in your name as far in advance as possible \u2013 some apartments will let you reserve an elevator a few months in advance. If you don\u2019t, it might be a long night of waiting in the apartment lobby, waiting for an elevator to be free. Be sure to always check with the apartment manager to see when you can use the elevators, as some buildings have restrictions about what times of the day the service elevator can actually be used. Get all of the information you can, as far in advance as you can, and plan your move accordingly."

Luckily, you can register your change of address with Canada Post, and for a small fee ($36 for six months), they can redirect any mail sent to your old address to your new one. That will give you plenty of time to make sure all of your contacts are up-to-date regarding your whereabouts without having to worry about whether an important package will arrive at your new place or on the other side of town."

This can be extremely important, especially if you\u2019re the type that depends on things such as the Internet for work or school."

Go through your new apartment room by room, and try to think of everything that you will need for each room. These might include things like:\nMajor furniture items, such as a bed, a couch, a dining table and chairs, a coffee table, wardrobe and a desk. Kitchen items and appliances, such as cooking utensils, pots and pans, a microwave, a kettle, a toaster, cups, glasses and cutlery. Smaller necessities, such as a shower curtains, curtain liners, extension cords, trash can, clothes hangers, an ironing board, a fan and possibly a heater, a toolkit, and light bulbs. Cleaning supplies, such as a vacuum cleaner, broom and dustpan, mop and bucket, sponges, toilet brush, soaps and detergents. Hygiene basics, like towels, bath soap, hand soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, tissues, and toilet paper."
