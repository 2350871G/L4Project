          "description":"Because rabbits will hide in accumulations of vegetation, a great way to deter rabbits is to keep your grass mowed short, remove any unnecessary vegetation such as tall grasses, and clean up plant debris regularly. Also, be sure to trim off and discard low-hanging bottom branches on bushes and shrubs, which rabbits may use for cover. Finally, fill in any existing burrows you may find on your property. Tour your property regularly to find potential sites of infestation as well as burrows that need covering. Check sites where you have taken measures to deter rabbits on a regular basis to maintain control over these areas."

          "headline":"Secure structures.",
          "description":"Make sure no rabbits are hiding in any holes you may find under sheds, decks, stairs, and other places where rabbits may find shelter. Seal these holes with chicken wire or wood. Use chicken wire mesh or wood board spacing of one inch (2.5 cm) or less to reduce the chances rabbits will gain entry. Check places where you have secured the structure on a regular basis to make sure the repairs are intact. Pest control services that specialize in small animal removal and control may be able to recommend contractors who may be able to help you secure structures."

If you have a water source on your property\u2014a stream, creek, pond, etc.\u2014you can build fences around them to encourage rabbits to build their habitat elsewhere. As with sealing holes, be sure that the fence you build is made of a mesh that has one-inch holes or smaller. You should also bury the bottom of the fence at least four to eight inches underground and ensure it is at least two feet high. Be sure to maintain your fence over time. Rabbits may find weak spots or dig up sections along the ground to re-gain entry."

          "headline":"Plant as many rabbit-deterring plants as possible.",
          "description":"Few plants will be off-limits to rabbits as food, but some are certainly on the lower end of desirability, and planting these might encourage rabbits to go elsewhere in search of food. These undesirables include annuals such as goatweed, impatiens, and verbena, perennials like echinacea and honeysuckle, and groundcover such as big periwinkle and bougainvillea. Combined with perennials and annuals, shrubs like rhododendrons and camellias can offer an extra deterrent. Consult with a landscape designer on ways to incorporate these plants into your garden in an effective and aesthetically pleasing way."

          "description":"Like plants, not all trees that rabbits dislike are always off-limits to them, but there are some that seem to be less preferred. These trees may, in turn, be worth planting as a means to making your landscape less desirable to rabbits. These include alder and birch trees. Visit a tree farm to see if you can purchase young trees that can be planted on your property."

Wrap hardware cloth around the bases of shrubs and trees that are susceptible to damage. Rabbits cannot gnaw through hardware cloth and it will effectively protect shrubs and trees. Some people use this technique with great success. Hardware cloth despite the name is not a cloth, but rather a galvanized wire screen that comes in rolls and is available from your hardware store."

Bury the bottom of the fence 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm) into the ground to prevent rabbits from digging under it. Extend it at least three feet (one meter) above ground. Be sure to install flashing along the bottom of gates to ensure rabbits can't squeeze underneath to gain access to the garden.

Some of these sprinklers not only spray a burst of water to deter rabbits, but also emit a sound that is annoying to rabbits. This option is also environmentally friendly and humane because it does not use any chemicals\u2014only water and sound. These sprinkler systems are available in hardware stores and online and they are fairly easy to set up, generally staking into the ground much like a standard sprinkler used for watering your lawn.

Remember that some repellents may have to be applied more than once per season. Some repellents include:\nBlood or bone meal fertilizer. Blood or bone meal fertilizer repels rabbits because they are natural herbivores, and, as an added bonus, these fertilizers are great for your garden. Chemical repellents. Some chemical repellents like ammonium soaps can help deter rabbits, but they may not be safe for the more delicate plants in the garden, so be sure to read the label. A solution containing the bitter Bitrex can also be sprayed to deter rabbits, but generally only if the garden is made up of flowers because Bitrex will alter the taste of vegetables."
