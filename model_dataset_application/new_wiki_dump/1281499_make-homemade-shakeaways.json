          "description":"Measure out how much candy you want to add to your ShakeAway, and pour it into a plastic bag, bowl, or mortar. If you add your candy to a bag, you can smash the candy with a hammer or rolling pin. If you add your candy to a bowl, you can smash the candy using a pestle, or smash in the candy in the mortar using the pestle. Once all your candy is smashed, add it to the blender. It doesn't matter what kind of bag you use, but the main point is that you want your candy to be confined somewhere where you can smash it collectively and keep the candy together. The more translucent the bag material is, the better you can see portions of the candy that are already smashed, or still need to be smashed. Be sure to keep a lookout for holes in the bag created by smashing the candy. Smashing the candy helps with blending the candy into the ShakeAway, and also helps reduce damage to the blender\u2019s blades."

Depending on the size of your candy pieces, you might have to try a higher blender setting if your candy pieces are bigger.

Normally, ShakeAways have a consistency where the candy pieces are small enough to fit through a straw, and the ice cream, milk, and candy can be eaten with a spoon, but still thin enough to immediately spill if knocked over. A general rule of thumb is, blend the mixture less to have a thicker ShakeAway, or blend it more to have a thinner, smoother ShakeAway."
