You might notice that the example in the picture is cut into quarters to make it easier to turn and serve. Keep the heat down and check regularly so you don't burn it. Alternatively, you can fry it as you would scrambled eggs. Stir with a wooden spoon, as you would scrambled eggs until the mixture is cooked. The eggs will look dry."
