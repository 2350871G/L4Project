This will help to remind you where to keep each food type, as well as making it easier for others to put food back in the right spots. There are scientifically proven areas to store foods in a fridge for optimal cooling effect. The exact optimal positioning for foods depends on the make of your fridge, but in general, the door is warmest (and hot air hits those items every time the door is opened), so more resilient food should go there, such as condiments. The shelves nearer the freezer are usually the coldest, while the crisper tends to create a warmer barrier that causes the shelf above it to be warmer. Meat and fish is often best mid-level to avoid freezing or warmth but this will depend on space availability and likelihood of dripping. How far you want to take this approach is up to you; often experience will tell you best! As well as labels, consider adding a few permanent containers for certain items like syrup, opened pasta sauce containers and preserves. Having permanent containers for such items makes it easy to pull them out and to locate them. Customized long containers are available for fridges from specialist stockists. Label these too."
