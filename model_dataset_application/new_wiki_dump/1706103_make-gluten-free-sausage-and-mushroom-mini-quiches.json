  "text":" Prepare the Crust Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230\u00b0C) and spray a muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray.  Combine the brown rice, cheese and egg.  Place 1/4 cup of the brown rice mixture into each muffin tin cup.  Using clean wet hands, press the rice mixture against the sides and bottom of the muffin cups. Using wet hands will help the rice not stick to your fingers. Bake the rice-lined tins in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the crust has browned.  Remove the muffin tins from the oven and allow the crusts to cool to room temperature before proceeding.  Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160\u00b0C) and make sure that you've positioned your oven rack so that it is in the center of the oven, about 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) over the burner.  Prepare the Sausage Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook the turkey sausage in the nonstick skillet, stirring occasionally with a spatula until the sausage is golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Spoon the cooked sausage into a large bowl and set it aside.  Prepare the Mushrooms Add the olive oil to the skillet.  When the oil is sizzling, add the mushrooms and cook them for 5 to 7 minutes, until they are brown and softened.  Transfer the mushrooms to the bowl with the sausage and toss the ingredients together.  Turn off your stove burner and set the skillet aside.  Let the sausage and mushroom mixture cool for 5 minutes. Then, stir in the scallions, cheese and pepper. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of sausage filling into each brown rice crust in your muffin tin.  Prepare the Egg Filling Whisk together the eggs, egg whites and milk in a separate bowl until just combined.  Use a small measuring cup to pour part of the egg mixture over the sausage filling until the level of the eggs comes over the level of the filling.  Divide the egg mixture evenly between each cup so that your quiches will be uniform in appearance.  Bake and Serve the Mini Quiches Bake the quiches in your oven for 25 minutes. The tops should be slightly browned and puffed up. Cool the muffin tin on a wire rack for about 5 minutes after the quiches are done.  Use a butter knife to gently loosen the crusts that may have adhered to the sides of the muffin pan.  Remove each quiche individually from the muffin tin. You can either use your butter knife or a slender spatula. Serve each quiche on an individual plate. You can also cool the quiches to room temperature and then freeze them for later use.",
