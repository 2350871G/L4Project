      "headline":"Pick out an Airsoft Gun.",
      "description":"Always get a gun with at least 350 fps for field, or 300-350 for close quarter battle (CQB). Anything lower than that would be a very cheap gun. Get a small sidearm, preferably a CO2 or green gas/propane powered handgun with a holster. Small automatic assault rifles (AEGs) can be used as a secondary weapon as well. Buy your primary weapon, preferably an AEG over 350fps for a field game, at least 300fps, but not over 350fps for CQB or a Sniper Rifle 'Over 400fps'."

      "headline":"Consider buying grenades.",
      "description":"A major asset to airsoft games are grenades. These devices give you the upper hand during skirmishes and other tactical advances. Smoke grenades, which can be bought at your local firework stand, are usually very effective. Airsoft grenades are also effective. To make these you'll need a plastic Easter egg. Fill it with airsoft BB's and 1 M-1000 and poke a hole the top half of the Easter egg so you can stick a fuse in it. Then light it and Boom. Not all fields allow these though, and used improperly can be really dangerous."

    {
      "headline":"Invest in a flashlight.",
      "description":"If you're in a dark area and if your sidearm/primary has a rail system integrated on it, then get a flashlight that has a connector to slide onto your rail system."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Buy a camouflage outfit.",
      "description":"Make sure that camo matches to what type of forest or other terrain you are playing your airsoft game in. Common places to play are urban, snow. desert, and green forest."

      "headline":"Buy a good amount of BB's and CO2 or gas.",
      "description":"If your gun is 300-350 FPS get 0.20 g bbs, and for 350-400 FPS get 0.25 g bbs. Always get 12 gram CO2 cartridges, or gas if you're using a gas blow back pistol, preferably 15 CO2 rounds and 8000 of your choice weight BB's. That should last you a couple days in FULL-DAY airsoft wars."

    {
      "headline":"Check the range on your toy guns.",

A screwdriver is great for switching out parts for your gun and removing things off the rail system. The knife is great for cutting items such as zip-ties and cutting tape. Duct tape is helpful to every aspect of airsoft."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Wear gloves.",
      "description":"Another great safety item are gloves. They are very useful when you need to take position in a tree and you don't want to cut your hands or you need to pick up something that you couldn't without hand protection.
