While most games are traditionally played with ten pegs regardless of how many players you have, if desired, you can vary the number of pegs based on the number of players. For example, a full six-player game would use ten pegs, while each player in a four-player game would use 13, and each player in a two-person game would use 19 pegs."

You can only \"hop\" over a peg during your turn if you have not already moved into a vacant hole directly adjacent to your peg during the same turn. You can hop over pegs in any direction, and you can hop over any peg, including your own. You can continue to hop over as many pegs as you want during a single turn, as long as you only move one peg. Each peg you hop over must be in line with your peg's current position. This is the only way to move a peg more than once during a turn, and it is theoretically possible to hop your way across the entire board in one turn using this tactic."

You can create a rule which states that a player who is prevented from moving a peg into a destination triangle can swap that peg with the one blocking it. You can also decide that if one or more filled holes in an occupied triangle are filled with other players' pegs, these pegs actually count toward the blocked player's victory.

If this happens, the losing player must remove his or her pegs from the board and sit out the rest of the game.

For instance, you could draw straws or play a game of rock-paper-scissors. Playing the Game and Moving Pegs Take turns. After the first person takes his or her turn, the person to that player's left should take a turn next. Continue moving around the board in this matter, traveling to the left until you reach the first player again. The cycle then repeats. Aim for the opposing triangle. You can move pegs in any direction across the board. You can even move them into other triangles that are not currently in use. To win the game, you must move all ten of your pegs into the triangle directly across from your starting triangle. Move into one adjacent hole at a time. The most basic way to move one of your pegs is to move it into an adjacent hole. Pegs can move in any direction: side to side, forward, or backward. You can move one peg into one empty hole like this per turn, unless you choose to \"hop\" your peg over another peg instead. Hop over other pegs. The other way to move your peg is to \"hop\" over adjacent pegs into a vacant hole on the other side. There must only be one peg blocking you from the empty hole, and the empty hole must be directly beyond that peg and in the same direction as the peg itself in relation to the peg you move. You can only \"hop\" over a peg during your turn if you have not already moved into a vacant hole directly adjacent to your peg during the same turn.

This is the only way to move a peg more than once during a turn, and it is theoretically possible to hop your way across the entire board in one turn using this tactic. Do not remove your pegs. Unlike traditional Checkers, you do not remove pegs from a Chinese Checkers board once those pegs have been hopped over. Those pegs stay where they are until the player who is using them decides to move them. Do not move pegs out of the destination triangle. Once you move one of your pegs into the opposing triangle, you cannot move it out of the triangle for the rest of the game. You can move it within that triangle, though. Pegs that are moved into other triangles can still be moved out. Establishing Rules Establish rules governing \"blocked\" holes.
