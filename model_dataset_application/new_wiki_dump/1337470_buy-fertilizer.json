The numbers represent the percentage of nitrogen, phosphate (which is representative of phosphorus), and potash (which indicates potassium) in the fertilizer. Choose a fertilizer that provides higher amounts of the nutrient that your soil is lacking. This means that a NPK value 3-1-2 indicates 3 parts nitrogen to 1 part phosphorus to 2 parts potassium. Pick this type of fertilizer if the soil needs a lot of nitrogen. Don\u2019t worry if you haven\u2019t done a soil test to check exactly what nutrients the soil needs. Generally, the label on the fertilizer will specify the type of plants and soil that the fertilizer is recommended for. Lawn fertilizers tend to have higher amounts of nitrogen whereas fertilizers designed for fruit and flowers have higher levels of potassium and phosphorus. General purpose fertilizers often have an equal ratio of the nutrients."

If you're wanting an organic fertilizer that's high in potassium, choose kelp or wood ashes. Organic fertilizers tend to be slow-releasing, which means that they slowly release nitrogen into the soil rather than working straight away. A disadvantage of some organic fertilizers is that there can be an unpleasant smell.Warning: If you have a stream or waterway close by, pick a slow-release organic fertilizer. This minimizes the risk of runoff, which causes excessive nutrients accumulating in the waterway. This process is called eutrophication and it can unbalance the natural ecosystem and result in serious damage."
