          "description":"Pour 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of water into the saucepan first, then add 2.75 fluid ounces (81 mL) of light corn syrup, 5 ounces (140 g) of sugar, and 1 gram (0.035 oz) of salt. Use a whisk to stir all these ingredients together. After you've whisked the ingredients together, you should be left with a smooth, syrupy mixture. Use a stainless-steel saucepan, if possible, since a nonstick saucepan will have a Teflon coating that may come off as you stir the syrup and end up in your whipped cream. If you can\u2019t use a stainless-steel saucepan, definitely avoid using a metal whisk to stir the water, corn syrup, and sugar."

          "headline":"Set the saucepan over medium heat and cook the syrup for 3 minutes.",
          "description":"Turn the temperature dial on your stove to 5 (if it\u2019s out of 10) to set it to medium. Use a fork to stir the syrupy mixture and cook it on the stovetop until it starts bubbling around the edges, or around 3 minutes. If your stovetop temperature dial doesn\u2019t go up to 10, simply turn the dial to the middle number to set it to medium. For example, if your dial goes up to 12, turn the dial to 6 for medium heat. If your saucepan is a nonstick pan instead of stainless steel, don\u2019t use a metallic fork to stir the syrup, as this might scrape off pieces of Teflon. Use a small wooden spoon or other non-metallic stirrer instead to avoid getting Teflon in your syrup."

          "description":"Set the temperature dial to 6 or 7 out of 10 to set your stove to medium-high heat and continue cooking the syrup. Use a thermometer to monitor the syrup\u2019s temperature until it reaches 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C). If the numbers on your temperature dial don\u2019t go from 1 to 10, medium-high heat will be the number that is slightly less than halfway between the middle number and the highest number. For example, if your temperature dial went up to 8, then medium-high would be between 5 and 6. You don\u2019t need to stir the syrup during this step, just allow it to cook. It should take about 4 minutes for your syrup to reach 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C)."

Allow the syrup to cool until it reaches 212 \u00b0F (100 \u00b0C), or about 3 minutes. Most bowls made out of ceramic or glass are generally heat-resistant. To be safe, check the bottom of your bowl or the packaging it came in for a \u201cheat-safe,\u201d \u201coven-safe,\u201d or \u201cmicrowave-safe\u201d label to make sure it\u2019s safe to use with hot syrup."
