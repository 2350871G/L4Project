          "description":"One of the first challenges when you\u2019re working with an open space is to break it into usable sections. Try arranging your furniture to create specific areas within the larger space. You can use bookshelves, sofas, bedroom furniture, and tables as boundaries for each space. For instance, if you\u2019re creating a living room space, you might place a sofa and a loveseat in an L-shape, with end tables on either side of the seating area, an entertainment console and TV across from the sofa, and a coffee table in the middle of the \u201croom.\u201d\nTo make an office area, you might set up a desk, a short bookshelf where you store your work supplies, and a comfortable office chair."

          "headline":"Add carpets and rugs to help define each space.",
          "description":"You don\u2019t just have to rely on your furniture to help create visual boundaries. Large carpets and rugs can help anchor a space, making each area feel deliberate and self-contained. This works especially well for living and sleeping areas, but you can also use rugs to create a cozy entryway, define a dining area, and more! Opt for floor coverings in light-colored neutrals if you want to create an airy feel, or go bold with pops of color if that\u2019s more your style."

          "description":"It can be a challenge to create individual spaces while still preserving the open flow of a loft apartment, especially if your loft is on the smaller side. Make sure you always leave plenty of room for your walkways; otherwise, even the most open space will feel cramped and crowded. For example, if you have a path where you walk from your living area to your kitchen, you would want to ensure that all of the furniture, walls, and decor along that path are spaced at least 36 in (91 cm)."

          "headline":"Use folding screens or panels to create wall-like partitions.",
          "description":"If you want a space to have a little more privacy, create the illusion of walls by setting up folding screens or panels. These are typically lightweight and easy to move around, so you don\u2019t have to commit to a certain layout. If you own the loft or have permission from the owner, you can even install tracking in the ceilings to hang drapes. That way, you can easily open the drapes when you want the apartment to feel more spacious, but you can close them when you want privacy. You can even install sliding walls or bookshelves for more permanent partitions. This is a great way to make a bedroom feel more private, to create an area where you can change clothes, or to wall off distractions from a study space."

For instance, a chandelier over your dining area will create an intimate setting for your meals, while pendant lights in your kitchen might add warmth while visually separating the space.Tip: Try installing track or cable lighting throughout most of the loft. That way, you can adjust each individual light to shine exactly where you need it."

          "description":"As you\u2019re decorating your apartment, look for a certain pattern, texture, shape, or color that you can use in different places around the space. That way, when someone looks at the space as a whole, everything will be tied together. For instance, you might decorate your loft in rich, warm neutrals, but then have fuscia-colored accents throughout the apartment to tie it all together. You can even use repeating shapes to create a cohesive feel. For instance, you could hang round picture frames and clocks on the walls, use a round rug in the living area, and have a round dining table."

          "headline":"Use pops of color to make the space feel bright.",
          "description":"Due to their high ceilings and open layout, loft apartments can feel somewhat industrial. If you want to bring warmth into the loft, use brightly-colored decorations as focal points throughout the space. For example, if you have wide, open walls, you might choose an oversized painting or wall hanging in an eye-catching hue. Throw pillows, rugs, and vases can also be used to add color to your space. Tip: Take advantage of an open floor plan and include conversation pieces throughout your loft. Browse thrift stores, flea markets, and vintage stores for eye-catching, unique pieces that reflect your personal style!"

          "description":"Not all loft apartments are warehouse-sized. If your loft is on the smaller side, stick to scaled-down furniture, like a loveseat instead of a sofa or a bistro table instead of a large, traditional dining set. You might also opt for furniture that you can easily see through to make the space seem larger. For instance, a solid wood end table would block your view and make the room feel closed off. However, a table made of metal and glass would almost create the perception that there\u2019s nothing there."

          "description":"It can be a challenge to adequately light a large loft, so it\u2019s important to make the best use of your natural light. Loft apartments often have large windows, so opt for sheer curtains that will allow some of that light to filter through. If you have the option, you might also want to arrange your space so your office, dining area, or living space are placed closest to the windows, since they need to be well-lit. Don\u2019t feel like you have to limit yourself to white curtains! You can find sheer curtains in almost any color you can imagine."

If you have high ceilings, hang shelves at and above eye level so you can stash important items that don\u2019t necessarily need to be out in the open. Keep paperwork and other items tidy by placing them in attractive boxes or folders before you store them on the shelf. Floating shelves look especially nice on exposed brick or stone walls, and they\u2019ll allow you to preserve your loft\u2019s cool industrial feel.

You can then tuck the basket beneath a console table, place it at the foot of your bed, or store it in a corner out of the way somewhere. A large basket with a lid is a great place to store winter coats and accessories when the weather turns warm."

These often have casters on the bottom so you can move them easily, and they\u2019re usually inexpensive.
