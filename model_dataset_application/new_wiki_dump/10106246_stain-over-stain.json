In addition, you'll be able to make sure you don't miss any spots and you can thoroughly cover the facing behind the doors and drawers. Taking off any hardware will ensure they don't accidentally get coated with stain."

If you want to lighten the wood you're working with, you'll have to strip it first. In addition to creating a lighter finish, you will need to strip the wood first if your piece has a lacquered topcoat. You can remove the original stain with a chemical stripper or by sanding it away."

Use a sanding block or sponge so you apply even pressure. If you already sanded the wood to remove the previous stain, you don't need to sand it again. Don't sand through the existing finish or you'll end up with a splotchy appearance."

The main difference between the different types of stains is their texture. If you're not sure which one you prefer, ask an associate at your local home store for a small sample of each, then test them on your piece in an inconspicuous area."

You will also be able to achieve thinner coats, which will allow the stain to absorb better into the wood. When stain absorbs into the wood, you are better able to see the wood grain in the finished product."

You can buy staining pads designed specifically for this purpose. They are made so that they won't leave streaks in the stain. If you leave a little of the excess stain, you'll get a darker finish, but it can be hard to get the color even this way."

Let the first coat dry completely before you decide, though, because the color can change as the stain dries. If you just need to adjust the color slightly, opt for a dye toner instead of a second coat."

These are usually applied after the sealer coat, but read the manufacturer's instructions to be sure. A dye toner will give you a thin wash of color that will stay. If your color is too red, use a green dye. If you need to warm up the color, use a red or orange dye. Pigment toner can also be used, but it will cause the color to become muddy."

Although the chemical stripper is clear, if it spills or drips, it could ruin the finish on your table or floors. If you don't have a drop cloth or a tarp, use old, thick towels instead."

At a minimum, gloves and eyewear can protect you in case of a spill or a splash. Try to avoid getting any of the stripper on your clothes, as the contact with your skin can cause burns.

Very fine steel wool is graded as #00, but you could use #000 or even #0000, depending on what you have on hand. The finer the grade, the smoother the surface of your wood will be when you're finished, but the longer the process will take. Depending on the size of your project, you may need several packs of steel wool. They are often sold in packs of 6. You can purchase both refinisher and steel wool at home improvements stores."
