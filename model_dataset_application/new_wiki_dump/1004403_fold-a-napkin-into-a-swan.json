  "text":" Making a Swan with a Paper Napkin Start with a square paper napkin. Place it on a clean working surface in front of you, oriented as a diamond so that one of the corners is pointing towards you. White napkins are a classic choice here, but you can also use colored or patterned napkins. If using a patterned or colored napkin, begin with the pattern or colored side down. Fold the napkin in half vertically. Bring the right corner of the napkin over to the left corner and crease the fold. Reinforce the fold by running your fingers along it. It is important to have a crisp line here. Open the napkin. Unfold the napkin and turn it over, maintaining the diamond orientation with the center crease running between the top and bottom corners. Fold the right corner over just past the center crease. For this fold, imagine the 90-degree angle of the bottom corner as divided into three 30-degree angles. You want to bring the right corner towards the left along a 30-degree line. Crease the fold that you've made. It might help to imagine the new fold as pointing to a one o'clock position. Fold the left corner over to the right. Line up the left corner and edge with the right edge and crease the fold. Now you have folded the diamond in thirds. Fold the top flap back on itself. Take the edge of the top flap (the part you folded over in the previous step) and fold it back to the left edge, making a crease along the center line. Fold the bottom flap back on itself. Repeat the previous step for the other flap: bring the corner of the bottom flap over to the right edge and crease along the center line. Fold the bottom tip just a little past the top tip. Bring the lower corner (the one pointing towards you) up and over the top corner, going just past it. Crease the fold. The part that goes past it will turn into the swan's \"beak,\" so let that inform how you make your fold. Make the beak. Fold the tip of the upper flap back on itself so that it points towards the bottom edge. Turn the napkin over. Notice the crease you made in Step 2, which should be running from the bottom edge to the top. Fold along the central vertical crease. Grasp the napkin in both hands and fold the swan in half along the vertical crease. You should begin to see your swan taking shape. Reinforce the creases along the bottom and front of the swan by running your forefinger and thumb along them. Prepare to make the base folds. Return the swan to the work surface and orient it so that the base has a bottom tip pointing towards you and then a right and left corner. The \"back\" of the neck should form a vertical line ending in the bottom tip. Fold up the bottom tip of the top flap slightly. Lift the bottom corner of the top flap and bring it up slightly, making a horizontal crease that runs between the right and left corners. Repeat with the other flap. Turn the swan over and repeat the previous step with the other flap. Now you have made the base folds. Stand the swan up. Open folds you've made at the bottom so that they form a base for the swan to stand on. Place the swan on a place setting. Now that you've learned how to make a swan, you can make several more for a delightful display. Making a Two-Swan Heart with Cloth Napkins Lay your napkin flat on the table. If there is a design on one side, place that side facing down. Note that you can use either a square or a rectangular napkin for this step. Napkins of stiffer material may be easier to work with. Roll both sides in until they meet each other. Make the rolls relatively tight. If you are using a rectangular napkin, make your rolls so that they run the long way. To be sure that your rolls are equal halves, make a light crease through the center of the napkin for reference by folding it in half and unfolding. (If you're using a rectangular napkin, make the crease so that it runs the longer length of the cloth.) Fold the napkin into a scrunched-up Z shape. Holding the napkin lengthwise in front of you, fold it about two-thirds of the way back on itself. Next, take the part you've folded over and fold it back on itself once again, this time in half. Place something heavy on top of the folded napkin for one minute. A hardcover book or plate will do the trick. When the minute is up, remove the weight. Repeat Steps 1-4 on another napkin. If you want to make a uniform swan heart, use a napkin with the same design. If you prefer to mix things up, choose a napkin with a different pattern or color. Put the napkins together to make a heart. It may take a little time to figure out the right positioning for your swans to stay upright. If you're having trouble, try adjusting how much you bend their necks and where you place their heads together. Keep in mind that very smooth table surfaces may cause the swans to slide away from one another; try to place them on a tablecloth, placemat, or other surface that offers a bit of friction.",
