          "description":"Give your cutting the best chance of putting on growth by selecting a healthy plant to cut. If you're propagating a leafy plant, include several leaves since these will give the plant nutrients. If you're propagating a plant that doesn't have leaves, cut a 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) piece of branch from a healthy part of the plant. Propagating means multiplying a plant using an existing piece of the plant. Propagating cuttings allows a new plant to grow roots faster than if you grow them from seeds."

          "description":"Pour a little of your rooting powder into a small container. Take your cutting and dip its stem end in water, then press the wet end of the stem into the small container of rooting powder. Let the stem dry for 1 minute before shaking off the excess powder.Did You Know? Rooting powder contains the same hormones as the plant which helps the plant grow roots faster. Some powders also contain fungicides that protect the plant from disease as it establishes roots. Using separate containers of powder for the cuttings prevents the spread of disease between the plants. You can buy rooting powder from most lawn and garden centers. Some products are sold as gels, so you may not need to dip the cutting's stem in water first."

This light mixture allows oxygen and water to circulate around the developing roots. Insert 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of the cutting into the mixture. Purchase a simple propagation mixture or make it at home. Good drainage is important for root growth. If the soil becomes waterlogged, the roots will rot instead of thriving."

Trap moisture by placing the cutting container in a plastic bag and loosely tie it closed. Insert a few sticks into the soil to keep the bag from touching the cutting. The evaporating moisture is trapped by the bag. This creates a humid environment that nourishes the cutting."

Keep in mind that if you're propagating a cutting that doesn't have leaves, such as a hardwood plant, it will get energy from its woody stem instead of from leaves. Ensure that the temperature where you keep the cutting is between 65 and 75 \u00b0F (18 and 24 \u00b0C) to prevent the cutting from drying up. If the area is too cold, buy a heating mat that you can place under the cutting container."

To increase the pH level, mix a liming agent or wood ash into the soil. To reduce the pH level, add sulfur or aluminum sulfate to the soil. If the soil's pH isn't between 6 and 7, it's difficult for the plant to access the phosphate in the soil. Phosphate is important for putting on new root growth and strengthening the current root system."

Buy a fertilizer that encourages growth and protects the roots from stress. Look for a fertilizer that contains more phosphorus and potassium than nitrogen and work the fertilizer into the soil around the plant. For example, choose a 3-20-20, which is higher in phosphorus and potassium than nitrogen."

Pour in 8 cups (1.9 L) of boiling water and leave the willow water to steep at room temperature for 24 to 48 hours.
