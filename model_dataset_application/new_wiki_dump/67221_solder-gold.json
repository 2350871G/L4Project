You can buy gold solder, designed for this purpose, as sheets, wire, or in 1 mm (~1/32 inch) chips. Cutting larger pieces of solder into chips is recommended, to make it easier to control the precise amount of solder being applied. Solder with a higher gold content is stronger, but takes more heat to melt. It is recommended for joining two pieces together. Use \"plumb solder,\" \"medium\" or \"hard\" solder, or solder with 14 karat and above. Solder with a lower gold content will melt more easily, and is recommended for small repairs. Use \"repair solder,\" \"easy\" solder, or solder below 14 karat. Check the label before buying pink or rose gold solder, as it may contain highly toxic cadmium."

Find a flux at a hardware or jewelry store that is safe for use on precious metals. This is sometimes called \"brazing flux\" due to the technical term for this high-temperature joining process. Flux comes in paste or liquid form, or as a powder that creates a paste when mixed with water. While brazing is technically a different process than soldering, even jewelers usually call this process \"soldering.\" A flux labeled \"soldering flux\" may work, but check the packaging to see if it is appropriate for gold."
