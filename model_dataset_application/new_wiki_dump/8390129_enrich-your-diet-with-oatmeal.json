          "description":"A bowl of oatmeal is a tried and true standard, especially in winter months. Because it's so versatile, you can use anything you like to flavor it, meaning oatmeal never has to be boring. Quick oatmeal is just as healthy as steel-cut oats, which take longer to prepare. This means you can feel free to use the quicker variety, although you may want to stay away from the microwaveable instant variety, which typically includes added sugar and sodium. If you want to sweeten your oatmeal, use honey or a little maple syrup, both of which are healthier sweeteners than refined sugar. You also might try spices, such as cinnamon and nutmeg. You can add fresh or dried fruits, such as bananas, blueberries, or strawberries. Nuts also mix well with oatmeal for breakfast, especially almonds, which add a healthy protein boost. If you prefer a bowl of cold cereal, you can add a healthy dash of oats by mixing in old-fashioned or quick oats, or buying a cold cereal made with oat bran or oat flour."

If you're not baking yourself, you typically can find oat bread and muffins at grocery stores or bakeries. If you're making your own, look for recipes that include various fruits and nuts if you want to add a dash of flavor or variety."

Mixing oatmeal in your smoothie can be especially helpful for a fuel-up snack before you test your endurance with a long-distance run or bike ride.
