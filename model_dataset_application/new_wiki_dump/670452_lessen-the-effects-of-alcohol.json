If you have food in your belly, the alcohol will enter your system more slowly and at a varied pace thus lessening the effects of alcohol immediately. This is especially important if you know you will be drinking for a sustained period, like a bar crawl."

Light-colored beers and white wine have fewer congeners than darker beers and harder liquors. Stay away from brandy, whisky, and red wine. Cheap boozes tend to give you a worse hangover. Your body expends more energy to process impurities left in the alcohol. Clearer alcohols like vodka, gin, and white rum are good options."

As one of the key causes of a hangover is dehydration, the more you do to combat it beforehand the better. If you have a hangover, be sure to drink plenty of water as well. Drink a pint of water before you go to sleep at night. Since your body continues to process water while you sleep \u2014 albeit less water \u2014 you will still wake up more dehydrated than when you go to bed. Since hangovers operate on dehydration, you can help lessen the effects of alcohol by drinking more water. Try to leave a glass of water by your bed so you can drink it when you wake up."

The enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase is released by your liver when you consume alcohol. The longer this enzyme is in your system directly relates to the length of your hangover. Get rid of it quickly if you want a shorter hangover. These researchers found that Sprite flushed the human system of alcohol dehydrogenase faster than any other beverage.
