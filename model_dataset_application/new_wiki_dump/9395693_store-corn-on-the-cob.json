Use your corn in a day or two if you've already removed the husks. To buy corn without peeling the husks back, start by looking for corn that has green husks and moist corn silk sticking out. The cob should feel firm all the way from top to bottom. Check for tiny holes, which indicate the corn has worms. If you must peel the husk, only do a little bit at the top to see if the kernels go all the way to the end."

However, if the whole cob looks moldy, you should throw it out instead of eating it. Moldy corn typically turns dark and the kernels shrivel.
