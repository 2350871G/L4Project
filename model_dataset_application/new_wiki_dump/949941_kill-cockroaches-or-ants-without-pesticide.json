Wear gloves when mixing this solution. Mix one cup (120 g) of boric acid with one cup (120 g) of flour. Add enough water to make it into a liquid. Pour the solution in small containers, like bowls or jar lids. Place them around your home in places where ants and roaches will likely be, like under the refrigerator and in the back of kitchen cabinets. You can also place them around outside. You can also soak cotton balls in the solution and set them out instead. Boric acid is toxic, so keep it away from pets and children."
