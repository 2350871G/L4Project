  "text":" Simple Labyrinth Draw a cross. Add dots on all four corners of an imaginary square. Connect the upper tip of the vertical line with the upper right dot using a curved line.  Using another curved line, connect the right tip of the horizontal line with the upper left dot.  Connect the left tip of the horizontal line to the lower right dot using a bigger curved line.  Elongate the vertical line on the bottom and connect its tip on the lower left dot.  Complex Labyrinth Draw eight concentric circles, leaving a small circle that will serve as the labyrinth's center. (Concentric circles sit one inside the other, like a target in a game of darts.) To make things as easy as possible, label the circles from 1-8, starting with the largest circle as number 1. (There will be references to numbered circles later in the instructions, so even if you decide not to physically label your circles, at least know which would be 1, which would be 2, etc.) At the labyrinth's center, draw a flower-like pattern. This is the center of most labyrinths. Your flower should be perfectly symmetrical--i.e., drawing a straight line through its center in any direction should yield two identical halves. If this is not the case initially, try to redo your flower so that it is. Draw two horizontal lines and four vertical lines across the labyrinth, taking care to avoid drawing through the center. The lines should align with the middle of the labyrinth. The lines should be spaced evenly apart. Erase lines to make labyrinth pathways. Starting with the left horizontal line, erase lines in circles 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7. Erase a part of circle 4, as shown here. When erasing, remember to make the pathway's size equal to the size of the spaces within circles. Erase the vertical line in the first circle, and leave the rest of them untouched. Erase parts of circles 3, 5, and 7. Erase the horizontal line in circle 7, but leave the rest of them untouched. Erase parts of circles 2, 4, and 6. Erase the first vertical line from the left within circles 3, 4, and 7. Leave the second vertical line untouched. Erase the third vertical line from the left within circle 7, leaving the rest untouched. Continue to erase lines within each circle to complete the pathways. For circle 1, erase the part between the first and second vertical lines. For circles 2 and 6, erase the part between the first and third vertical lines, as well as some from the left. For circles 3, 5, and 7, erase the part between the first and third vertical line, as well as some from the right. For circle 4, erase the part between the second and third vertical line.
