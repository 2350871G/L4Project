They are molded in a sweeping shape and are thinner at the top then the swollen area where you will hold it. It comes in different materials like cork, wood and plastic, as well as straight or oblique. You will want to start with a straight nib holder and maybe move on to the oblique holder when you start experimenting with different angles and scripts. Most nib holder are plastic or wood. This comes down to a matter of preference. Pick them up and play with them. Some will be heavier or wider. Choose whichever is most comfortable for you."

The mount on the nib, where it attaches to the nib holder, also varies. Be sure that the nib you choose is compatible with your holder. The easiest shape to begin with is the italic nib. This has a single, blunt edge and limited flexibility. This will help you create a more consistent line. Choose a nib with a mid-range tip size. Avoid one which is too thin or too thick. The italic nib should not have much flexibility. Flexibility is more suited to point nibs which have two tines that separate with added pressure."

Starting in the center, bottom portion of the lozenge, still holding the pen at a 45 degree angle, draw the pen straight down to create the stem, or minim, of the \u201ci.\u201d  Repeat the process of creating a lozenge to cap off the bottom of the letter. This time, keeping your pen at the same angle when you reach the bottom, draw the pen up and to the right at the opposite 45 degree angle to make a thin upward tick like a tail. You can also repeat this tick move to dot the \u201ci.\u201d\nCreate an \u201cl\u201d using the same process as creating the \u201ci.\u201d  The difference here is that the minim will be longer by several nib lengths.

To create the bottom of a \u201cu,\u201d simply make the same tick you used at the end of the bottom lozenge of the \u201ci,\u201d but elongate it to 1-1.5 nib lengths.
