Cut up about 2 tbsp (19.1 g) worth of chopped pickles, then use the knife to also finely chop up 1 tbsp (8.6 g) of capers. Sweet and dill pickles work best for a classic tartar sauce flavor."

This will make it easier to add the other ingredients to it to make tartar sauce. The homemade mayonnaise can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week. Creating Vegan Tartar Sauce Make a vegan mayo base with an immersion blender. In the immersion blender\u2019s container, add together the base\u2019s ingredients: \u20448 cup (30 mL) of unsweetened soy milk, \u20444 teaspoon (1.2 mL) of apple cider vinegar, \u20448 teaspoon (0.62 mL) of mustard, \u20444 teaspoon (1.2 mL) of maple syrup, 1/4 teaspoon (1.42 g) of salt, and \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of lime juice.

In this case, you may then need to double or triple the recipe to fill the larger container of your blender or processor. Only use soy milk, as almond and rice milk won\u2019t create a thick enough base. Blend the ingredients for 1 minute before adding in the canola oil. Keep the blender running while you add in \u20443 cup (79 mL) of canola oil. Drizzle it into the container with the other ingredients so that it all blends together evenly. Blend the ingredients for another 3 minutes. Keep going until the base starts to thicken up and have a creamy texture to it. If it\u2019s still too liquidy, add another dash of canola oil to the mix while you keep blending. Repeat with as much additional canola oil as needed to achieve the right consistency.

Add salt to taste, and stir the ingredients together with a spoon to combine. Keep stirring until the ingredients you added to the base are thoroughly mixed in with it. Place the sauce mix in the fridge for 30 minutes to set. Place cling wrap over the top of the bowl and leave it in the fridge for at least that long before you serve it. Letting it sit for longer will allow the flavors to infuse longer, so consider leaving it in the fridge overnight before serving.
