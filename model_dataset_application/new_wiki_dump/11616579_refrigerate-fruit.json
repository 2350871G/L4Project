          "description":"Most fully ripe fruits should go directly in the fridge when you get them home to preserve their flavor and texture. If you leave ripe fruit out at room temperature, it accelerates the ripening process dramatically. Avoid rinsing the fruit before storage! Wash produce right before you use it to maximize shelf life. This includes apples, melons, mangos, papayas, pineapples, peaches, nectarines, apples, plums, kiwi, star fruit, and pears. Avoid refrigerating ripe bananas, lemons, and limes. Ripe fruit has deep, even coloring and smells sweet and fresh. The skin is smooth and firm with a small amount of give if you apply pressure. Most ripe fruit feels slightly heavy for its size when you hold it in your hand. These fruits will stay fresh in the fridge for about 5-7 days. They\u2019ll deteriorate rapidly after that and should be tossed out."

          "description":"If these fruits aren\u2019t quite ripe when you get them home, it\u2019s important to leave them out at room temperature and let them fully ripen before you stick them in the fridge. If you refrigerate them prematurely, they can develop a mealy texture and lose their flavor. Keep them at room temperature for about 3-4 days before refrigerating them. This includes peaches, nectarines, bananas, mangos, melons, kiwi, plums, and so on. A green skin or rind typically indicates unripe fruit unless the fruit is citrus or supposed to be green (like kiwi or green apples). Immature fruits also feel hard to the touch and won't have much of an aroma."

They will start to spoil rapidly if you leave them at room temperature. This includes blackberries, raspberries, cherries, grapes, cranberries, and strawberries. Most of these fruits need to be tossed after 5-7 days. However, blueberries can last 1-2 weeks and cranberries 3-4 weeks in the fridge. Strawberries ripen the fastest and typically only last 3-5 days in the fridge."

Discoloration, especially darkening, is also a sign that you should toss the fruit. You can sort through berries and grapes and keep the good ones, since some of them may ripen faster than others."
