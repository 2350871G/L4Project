  "text":" Making the Dough Mix together  flour, sugar and salt. Use a food processor, or stand mixer, and stop when combined. Cut the butter into small pieces and place into the food processor.  Mix using 1 second pulses until the pieces of butter are the size of small peas.  Put the flour mix into a bowl and sprinkle the water evenly over the mix.  Fold the mix with a rubber spatula so the dough sticks together.  Sprinkle with more water, if necessary,if the dough isn't sticky enough.  Flour your hands and a rolling pin.  Separate the dough into two sections and form them into balls.  Flatten each ball of dough with the rolling pin until they are 4 inches (10.2 cm) in diameter.  Wrap each dough with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Forming the Crusts Flour your work area, your hands and the rolling pin.  Form the two rounds into balls and flatten each again into 4 inch (10.2 cm) rounds with the rolling pin.  Roll each dough round 2 inches (5.1 cm) larger than the diameter of the pie plate, edge to edge.  Gently fold one of  the dough rounds into quarters, place the pointed end in the middle of the pie plate and unfold.  Press the dough firmly into the plate, being careful not to tear the dough. Trim any dough that is hanging over the edge of the pie plate with kitchen scissors, if necessary. Place the other dough round onto a baking sheet lined with wax paper and cover loosely with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate the dough while you make the mincemeat filling.  Making the Filling Cut away any visible fat on the beef.  Chop the beef into small bite-size pieces.  Put the beef and apple cider into a large pot and bring to a boil.  Simmer, covered, until the meat is tender, approximately 20 minutes.  Add in the apples, sugar, dried fruit, raisins, suet, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice. Mix well. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the mixture becomes thick.  Place the mincemeat mixture into a sealed container and refrigerate for 1 to 7 days. This allows for the mincemeat to become more  flavourful. Or, instead of doing all of that, to prep the mincemeat filling, get some pre-seasoned mincemeat, fry it in a pan, stirring occasionally until it turns from pink to brown. Then turn off the fire and set the meat aside. Baking the Pie Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Spoon the mincemeat into the pie crust until filled. Store any extra mincemeat mixture in an airtight container in the freezer. Carefully place the remaining dough round on top of the filling. Trim any excess dough hanging over the edge. Crimp the edges of the pie crust together with a fork to create a seal. Cut 5 small slits in the top of the pie for venting. Bake the mincemeat pie in the oven for 40 minutes.  Finished. ",
