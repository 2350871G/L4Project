Mix some slow-release fertilizer in with the soil, pack it down loosely, and water it until the soil is wet. While perennial plants can be put in any time of year, they do best when started in early autumn or late spring. Annuals should always be planted during these times. The ideal planting time varies depending on your location, but you should generally stick to a season when the weather is turning and getting either warmer or colder.
