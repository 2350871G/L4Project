          "description":"This is perhaps the most common method, as all it requires is granulated sugar and a heavy-bottomed pan. Simply place the 3/4 cup sugar in the bottom of the pan and turn the heat on medium. Stir occasionally, breaking up any clumps, until the sugar is the color of a bright copper penny. Immediately remove from heat. A thick-bottomed pan is essential here -- as it will hold and distribute heat well to prevent parts of the sugar from burning. Lighter-colored pans make it easier to see when the sugar is done cooking."

          "headline":"Get a smoother stovetop caramel by making a \"wet caramel\" with water.",
          "description":"This method is a little more fickle, but it makes a smoother caramel by a long shot. To make it, combine 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water, and 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice in the bottom of a heavy-bottomed pan (off the heat). Once mixed, heat on medium-high heat until it boils, stirring throughout. Once it boils, stop stirring completely. Just wait and watch until it gets a copper penny color, then remove from the heat and let cool. Stirring agitates the sugars and creates a simple crystal -- AKA, sugar cubes, not liquid caramel. Once it boils, stop stirring. Use a wet rubber spatula if you need to scrape some sugar off the sides of the pan back into the mixture."

Stir so that all the sugar is wet and microwave for 5 minutes. After the 4 minute mark, don't take your eyes off the mixture. Once it hits a copper color, like a bright new penny, take it out of the microwave. If it isn't there by 5 minutes, keep cooking in 30-second increments."
