  "text":" Peeling by Knife Get a garlic bulb and separate a clove. A clove is one of the small, wedge-shaped pieces that make up the entire \"head\" of garlic. Simply pull one off the cluster with your finger tips. You can cut away the papery white skin as well to make this easier. Cut away the brown top of the garlic.

This makes peeling slightly easier, but it is not strictly necessary, and some cloves will not have much of a stub to remove. You can also cut the clove in half.

Your clove is now ready for cooking. Peeling by Water Remove as many cloves as you need from the head. Remove any easily peeled skins briefly before moving on. Soak the cloves in cold water for five minutes, making sure they are fully submerged. Place the cloves in 1-2 inches of water and let them rest. The water will loosen the skins.

Peeling by Microwave Remove the cloves you need from the head. Do no microwave the entire head of garlic, as this can ruin it for later nights. Simply remove the cloves you plan on using right then. Put the garlic clove/s in the microwave for 5-10 seconds. With the garlic on a small plate, heat them up briefly on high. You should notice the skin billowing and loosening. Cut away the loose remaining skin. Cut the root end off with a knife and the skin will slide off easily. Peeling By Shaking Place the entire garlic head inside one stainless steel bowl. This is a great method for pealing an entire head of garlic at once. Remove whatever loose papery skin you can by hand before beginning. Cover the bowl with another identical stainless steel bowl. Place the bowls together, open side to open side, to form a larger 'sealed' bowl. Hold the edges of the two bowls together and shake. Let the garlic clang around inside the bowls for 1-2 minutes, shaking vigorously. Open the bowls and remove any waste.

Pull the cloves you want to peel off the head and place them on a cutting board. Place the cloves evenly under a dry cloth. The cloth will control the garlic from flying off the table as you hit it. Any kitchen towel will do. Pound the garlic cloves once or twice with a mallet. This will crack the shell, allowing for better peeling.
