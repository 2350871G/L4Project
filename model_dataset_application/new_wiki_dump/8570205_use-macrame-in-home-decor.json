You could even hang one above the headboard of your bed or behind the sofa in the living room to tie the room together. Attach the tapestry to a wooden dowel (or a slender tree limb, for more of a natural look) to make it easier to hang and keep it from sagging.

          "description":"The classic dreamcatcher is a staple of many homes, and represents peace, restfulness and positivity. Rather than displaying an ordinary dreamcatcher woven from wire, try out a softer approach with the macrame version. The gentle fabric braids will bring you even more of a sense of comfort when you stop to admire it. Put the finishing touches on your dreamcatcher using beads, feathers and other decorative touches. Dreamcatchers are one of the simpler projects you can start with if you\u2019re just learning how to macrame."

Rather than keeping the doors in your home shut, simply tack the divider to the door frame to make your living space feel more open and inviting. Tie a couple beads onto the end of each strand to give the cords some weight so that they\u2019ll return to their original position. Use partitions to cover entryways and create separation between rooms that are close together."
