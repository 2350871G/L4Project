You can use a cabinet in your kitchen, garage (if it doesn't get too hot or cold), cellar, or even a nearby closet or bin. If no space is built in, be creative and create your own."

Just make sure to use them promptly. Oils and sauces: olive oil, vegetable oil, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and so on. Many sauces require refrigeration, so read the labels first. Baking supplies: baking soda, chocolate chips, salt, cooking spray. Canned goods. Prepared foods and snacks: crackers, cookies, dried fruit, chips, and anything else you like for munching."
