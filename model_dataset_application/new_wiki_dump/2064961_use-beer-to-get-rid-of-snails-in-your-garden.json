Maintenance and placement of this larger trap is the same as with the regular traps. In other words, fill it halfway with beer, sprinkle some yeast in it for greater efficacy, empty it every two or three days, and place it three feet from other traps. This trap could prove more effective than a regular beer trap, since snails will be unable to leave once they slide in to get the beer. Adding a small fence around the garden can help them from eating your vegetables and herbs."
