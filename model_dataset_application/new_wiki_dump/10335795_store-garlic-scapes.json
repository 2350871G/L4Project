If your scapes are very long, you might have to cut them in half before you put them in the water. Be aware that if you have too much water in the glass, putting the scapes into the water can cause the level to rise, resulting in a spill.

Throw the stalks away and purchase new ones if they\u2019ve been in the refrigerator for more than 2 weeks.
