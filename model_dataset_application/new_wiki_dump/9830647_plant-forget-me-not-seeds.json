Some forget-me-not species are more hardy than others when it comes to sunlight and grow better with more than 6 hours of sunlight. Take a look at your specific seed variety and look up whether it\u2019s partial to full sun or partial shade."

You want them to be at least 6-12 inches apart, especially if you\u2019re going to let them reseed naturally. If you\u2019re planting forget-me-nots in the fall, they will bloom for you in the spring. This might be a good time to plant other spring flowers, like daffodils and tulips. These flowers will rise up above the layer of blue forget-me-nots and add a gorgeous pop of color to your garden."

Place 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of fine mulch or up to 4 inches (10 cm) of larger material on top of the soil to keep moisture in until the seeds germinate. The mulch will also regulate the seeds\u2019 temperature."

Keep the mulch 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) away from the base of your plants. Wood chips are a popular choice for mulching, but you can also use grass clippings, shredded leaves, compost, or pine straw. Mulch placement can also feed earthworms and reduce weeds, both of which will help keep your forget-me-nots thriving."

If a whole stalk of flowers needs to be removed, cut off the stalk from where it grows at the base. Your forget-me-nots will naturally send out new flowers as long as you deadhead regularly. Don\u2019t deadhead if you want your forget-me-nots to reseed naturally. Leave the plants if you want them to flower again next year.

Spray water on your plants regularly to control aphids. Once knocked down, an aphid usually won\u2019t be able to make it back onto the plant. Make a trap for slugs and snails by filling an aluminum pie pan or cat food can with beer. Then, bury the pan or can so the lid is level with the ground. The pests will bypass your plants and head straight for the beer bath. Place one for every 3 metres (9.8 ft) of affected plants. Holes in your plants might be due to flea beetles. These insects are difficult to get rid of, though they cause little damage. You can vacuum them up for an immediate solution, but make sure to prevent them from coming back next season by laying down mulch, weeding frequently, and keeping your garden clean during and after growing season."

          "description":"If your forget-me-nots have developed fuzzy white mildew or tan spots on their leaves, it\u2019s an easy fix. First, snip off any affected parts of the plant with a pair of hand pruners. Then treat your plants with a fungicide, making sure to carefully follow the instructions on the label for safe and proper application. Wilted, dying plants with thin, cobweb-like strands around the base have a more serious problem called crown rot. This fungus is fatal, so dig up and get rid of any affected plants and ones nearby to stop the spread. Clean your hand pruners thoroughly with disinfectant wipes, rubbing alcohol, or soak them for at least a minute in a 1:5 solution of bleach to water. This will prevent the spread of infection to your healthy plants."
