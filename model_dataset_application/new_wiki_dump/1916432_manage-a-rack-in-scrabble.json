          "description":"Much of rack management in Scrabble is based on the ability to create anagrams, that is, to rearrange the order of the letters on your rack into meaningful words. You may find it helpful to move the tiles around on your rack until you see a word that you recognize. As you play the game more often, you'll develop the ability to rearrange the letters in your head. When rearranging tiles, it helps to place the tiles where they often appear in words. For example, letters like F and J are more likely to appear at the beginnings of words, so place them on the left side of your rack. But letters like S and Y are more likely to appear at the end of words, so place them on the right side of your rack."

          "headline":"Watch for common prefixes and suffixes.",
          "description":"Many words are formed by adding either a prefix to the beginning of the root word or a suffix to the end of the root word to change its meaning, tense, or part of speech. By recognizing these prefixes and suffixes when their letters appear on your rack, you can begin to make meaningful words out of the string of letters in front of you. Common prefixes: Common prefixes include DIS-, RE-, UN-, IN-, OUT-, OVER-, and ANTI-. Common suffixes: Common suffixes include -S, -ES, -ED, -ING, -LY, -IER, -IEST, and other superlatives."

If you can't make a word that uses these combinations right away, you may want to hold onto the letters until the opportunity to play them arises."

        {
          "headline":"Familiarize yourself with common compound words.",
          "description":"As you start to recognize common letter combinations used in words, you'll eventually start to recognize entire words on your rack. The next step is to start putting small words together into compound words, either with two words found on your rack or with a word on your rack and a word already on the board. For example, if you can find both LOW and DOWN in the letters your rack (with a separate W for each word), you can make the compound word LOWDOWN. Or, if the word HEAD is on the board, you can turn it into GODHEAD or BULKHEAD if you have the appropriate tiles on your rack and there are enough free spaces ahead of the H.\nRelated to this skill is the ability to recognize words within words. With some practice and the right letter tiles, you can expand PRAISE into APPRAISER or LIST into ENLISTEE, possibly even using both triple-word spaces at once."

          "description":"Learn to balance the score of the letters you play against the quality of tiles remaining on your rack and prospective words that can be made using the letters you play. As you start becoming more familiar with the words you can make in Scrabble, you need to start evaluating how well you can continue to make good plays while preventing your opponents from making major plays on your words. Some Scrabble players prefer to emphasize improving the selection of tiles on their racks through strategic play, while other players rely more on the layout of letters on the board. Whichever style of play you prefer, it helps to keep track of how many of each letter have been played and how many are left. If 11 of the 12 E tiles have been played and you have the last one, you may want to hang onto it to give yourself better options. This is especially applicable when holding the S or the blank, which can allow you a big score or a bingo on future turns."

If you can't make a word out of the tiles you have, you can exchange any or all of them for new tiles, at the cost of your turn. When exchanging tiles in the early game, you'll want to exchange as many tiles as you can to try to get an S or a blank. In the middle of the game, you'll want to hold onto to a medium or high-scoring tile to have a better chance of making a high-scoring word. Near the end of the game, you'll want to discard high-scoring tiles unless you see places on the board you can play them with the right additional letters."

          "description":"The distribution and point value of Scrabble tiles are based on the relative frequency of each letter's appearance in English language words. Thus, the more common the letter, the more likely it will appear in a 7-letter word or can be played in a word that will earn double or triple word score value. Hold on to the more common vowels and consonants for later and play the less common ones early on. The most common vowels, in order, are E, A, I, O, and U. The most common consonants, in order, are S, R, T, N, L, D, G, C, B, M, P, H, F, Y, V, W, K, X, J, Z, and Q. Be aware that the above lists are influenced by what other letters you have on your rack. For instance, if you have an C on your rack, you'll want to hold onto an H rather than a G, since CH is a good letter combination while CG is not. Note that not all expert Scrabble players agree on the letter rankings shown above. Also keep in mind that letters that haven't been played will influence which tiles you should hold on to and which you should play. You'll want to keep track of the number of U tiles and hold on to yours if you see the Q tile hasn't been played (and also memorize Q words that don't use the U, such as QI and QAT)."

If your rack has 6 vowels and only 1 consonant, you should look to play at least 3 of those vowels on your next turn. You can improve your ability to keep a good mix of vowels and consonants by memorizing vowel-rich 4-letter words such as AEON, AIDE, and AREA and 5-letter words such as AERIE, AUDIO, and QUEUE."

Near the end, it may be better to play the letter off than risk getting caught with it. Also, the low scoring tiles are more likely to be found in longer words than in shorter ones. Lean towards playing off high point tiles like the B, F, W, and Y quickly to open up more possibilities for making words with 1- and 2-point letter tiles. Also, note that late in the game, the Q (especially without the U) can be as difficult to play since very few short words contain the Q.
