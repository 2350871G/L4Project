For instance, if you pour three quarters of a cup of varnish for your first coat, add one quarter cup of thinner. For subsequent cups, you can pour 9 ounces of varnish and 1 ounce of thinner."

If your sandpaper becomes clogged with residue, it\u2019s a sign the varnish has not sufficiently dried. Light-wear projects, like trim, may only need one coat of varnish. Heavy-duty pieces like furniture may need around five. Let the final coat cure for several weeks before using the item."
