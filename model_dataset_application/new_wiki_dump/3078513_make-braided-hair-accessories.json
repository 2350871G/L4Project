Choose the thread colors. The three colors should complement or match each other and it's ideal if they are intended for certain color schemes within your own wardrobe. Align the three threads together. Place them side by side with care, so that they meet up together. Tie a knot about one inch from the end of the thread lengths. This will keep the three lengths together evenly while braiding. Begin braiding. Braid from the knot down the length of the yarn. Stop when you reach the desired length. This length can be ascertained from the length of the clip, barrette or other hair accessory you're going to be adding the design to. Tie another knot at the end of the braiding. This will prevent the braid from unraveling. The braid piece is now ready to be attached to the hair accessory. Attaching the braided piece to the hair accessory Ensure that the surface of the hair accessory is clean and dry.
