Now, you should have a four-sided box, with two diagonal lines connecting the corners and creating an \"X\" in the middle, and two perpendicular lines connecting the midpoints of the four individual sides and creating a cross shape in the middle. These lines will ensure that your tiles remain on course and straight as you lay them."

If you don't lay your tiles with the arrows facing the same direction, you may inadvertently alter the final pattern created by your tiles. You can choose to lay your tiles on a left right axis or forward back axis. If you want to intentionally change the look of your pattern, you can, but do so only after understanding that it will look different than advertised."

Clean your room of debris and residue to make sure that there is nothing that will interfere with your tiles. Each tile needs to lay perfectly flat to install properly, so even small bits of dust and junk can throw them out of alignment. Sweep and dust the area thoroughly. After, if there is highly resistant dirt or grit, it's a good idea to mop or clean the floor with some kind of solvent. Make two chalk lines across the diagonals of the room. Connecting the two sets of opposite corners of the room, create a chalk \"X\". The center of \"X\" is the perfect center of the room. Make four chalk lines around the perimeter of the room.
