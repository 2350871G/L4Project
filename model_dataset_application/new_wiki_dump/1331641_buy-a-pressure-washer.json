This would be a good model for cleaning a vehicle, garage floor or patio furniture. A medium-duty pressure washer with 1,950 to 2,600 psi can clean 40 to 90 square feet in 10 minutes. This type of pressure washer can handle larger areas, such as a driveway, sidewalk or deck. A heavy-duty pressure washer with 2,650 to 3,800 psi can clean 90 to 190 square feet in 10 minutes.

      "description":"Gas pressure washers are more powerful, but they have drawbacks. They are loud; have the added cost of buying gas, oil and spark plugs; are more difficult to start and have polluting emissions. Electric pressure washers are tethered to an electrical extension cord, which can restrict movements. The unit's power cord should have a built-in ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCl) to prevent electrical shock. Their electric motors are the limiting factor on their lifespan, as they are more prone to overheating and shorting out. Electric washers, however, tend to be far lighter than gas models (electric power washers start at a mere 15 lbs, where gas washers can weigh up to 200 lbs."

The width of the spray, which may range from a concentrated jet to a 40-degree fan, may be adjustable by twisting the nozzle or attaching different tips. Typically, most residential pressure washers include 4 interchangeable tips: 0\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 25\u00b0 and 40\u00b0. If you're unsure of which nozzle tip to use, be sure to test on an inconspicuous area of the same material by starting from 3\u20134 feet (0.91\u20131.2 m) away and moving closer."
