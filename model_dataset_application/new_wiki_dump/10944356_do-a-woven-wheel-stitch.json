Set the other stands aside to use when you run out. Insert the 2 strands through the eye of a tapestry needle and pull the floss until it is about 1/3 of the way through the eye. You may also want to tie a knot in the end of the embroidery floss to ensure that it does not slip through the fabric when you make the first stitch."
