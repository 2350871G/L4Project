Shake the jacket and use your fingers to massage clumps out of the down. Push any feathers that loosen during machine drying back into the jacket rather than pulling them out. This also gives you an opportunity to see if your jacket is dry. When the down stops clumping together and the jacket feels light and fluffy, it has finished drying."
