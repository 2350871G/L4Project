  "text":" Preparation Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap. This will ensure that the ravioli doesn't stick to the surface. Spray another baking sheet with nonstick vegetable oil spray.  Beat the egg in a small dish and set aside.  Assembling the Ravioli Place one wonton wrapper on the counter and brush the edges with the beaten egg.  Place one tablespoon of Nutella in the middle of the wonton wrapper.  Fold the wrapper diagonally. Press to seal the ravioli. Repeat this process until all the ravioli have been made.  Cooking the Ravioli Turn the stove burners on to medium-low heat.  Pour at least two inches (5cm) of vegetable oil into a frying pan.  Depending on the size of your pan, fry approximately two to four ravioli at one time.  Allow the ravioli to cook for 45 seconds on each side, turning each piece using a slotted spatula.  Transfer the cooked ravioli to the baking sheet. Spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place in the oven to finish off. Keep the ravioli warmed in the oven at 200\u00baF (100\u00baC). Dust the warm ravioli with powdered sugar before serving. Experiment with garnishes and toppings such as granulated sugar, cinnamon, sliced strawberries or bananas, a dollop of Nutella/whipped cream, or even frosting.",
