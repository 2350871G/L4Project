          "description":"Before you make any major changes to your childrens\u2019 diets, you should talk to your pediatrician. That way, the doctor can make any specific recommendations tailored to each child\u2019s health needs. In addition, the doctor will know to look for specific nutritional deficiencies common to vegetarianism. For example, your doctor might periodically test your children\u2019s iron levels, or they might ask you to monitor your children for signs of a B12 deficiency, which might include fatigue, disorientation, complaining of pins and needles, speech or memory impairment, or agitation. You can also consult with a nutrition expert, if you\u2019d like."

          "headline":"Decide what type of vegetarian diet to follow.",
          "description":"Vegetarian diets range from simply avoiding meat and poultry most of the time to going fully vegan, in which you avoid any animal products. As you contemplate changing your kids over to a vegetarian diet, think about exactly which foods you want to cut out, and which ones you\u2019re okay with your children still eating. Some of the more common types of vegetarianism include:\n\nPescatarian: Eats fish and seafood, dairy, and eggs, but no meat and poultry. Lacto-ovo vegetarian: Eats dairy and eggs, but no meat, poultry, or fish. Ovo vegetarian: Eats eggs, but no dairy, meat, poultry, or fish. Lacto vegetarian: Eats dairy, but no eggs, meat, poultry, or fish. Vegan: Does not eat dairy, eggs, meat, poultry, or fish."

          "headline":"Cut out meat gradually.",
          "description":"To make the transition easier, start by adding more vegetarian dishes to your meals, but still offer some meats as well. Then, gradually replace the meat in your dishes with all-vegetarian options. That way, your children\u2019s systems will have time to adjust to having less meat and more veggies, and you\u2019ll give them time to explore new dishes, as well. You might cut out specific types of meat one at a time. For instance, you might stop serving red meat, then after a few weeks, eliminate poultry from your children\u2019s diet, followed by fish, then dairy."

          "description":"It can be hard sometimes to get kids to eat their vegetables, especially for picky eaters. If you want to introduce more vegetarian-friendly foods into your kids\u2019 diets, try giving them all-veggie versions of foods they already enjoy. That will help picky kids overcome their initial resistance to change, and it can be a good way to teach them that food can be just as tasty without meat. Tip: For instance, you might make roasted veggie pizza, vegetarian fried rice, or vegetarian lasagna."

          "description":"A simple trick to get your children more excited about vegetables is to ask them to help you plan, shop for, and prepare meals together. If your children feel more involved in the process, they\u2019ll be more likely to want to eat the food they helped pick out and prepare. Older kids can help you with tasks like chopping veggies, and even small children can help with shelling beans or arranging ingredients on a pizza. If you have the space, you might even consider getting your kids involved in growing their own vegetable garden!"

          "description":"It can be a challenge to get enough iron in your diet when you\u2019re a vegetarian. Vegans are at the highest risk for iron deficiency, while lacto-ovo vegetarians, who eat dairy and eggs, have a lower risk. However, by giving your children foods that are high in iron, and by asking their pediatrician to monitor their iron levels, you can help ensure they have a balanced diet. Other foods that are high in iron include nut and seed butters, lentils, tofu, sweet potatoes, kale, and whole grains. You can also give your children cereal that\u2019s fortified with iron. Iron deficiency can lead to stunted growth, as well as learning and behavioral issues. Talk to your pediatrician about your child\u2019s specific nutritional needsDid You Know? Eating vitamin C can help your body absorb iron better, so pair iron-rich veggies with foods like tomatoes, citrus fruits, melons, bell peppers, and broccoli!"

However, if you\u2019re cutting out dairy products, you\u2019ll need to give your child plenty of calcium-rich foods like leafy greens, beans, peas, almond butter, or foods that are fortified with calcium.

To help overcome that, try soaking these foods in cool water for several hours before you cook them. Once you see sprouts starting to form, you can cook them as you normally would.

Instead, offer a soy-based formula, which is enriched with the vitamins and nutrients a baby needs to grow. Of course, talk to your doctor before you change your baby\u2019s formula.
