      "description":"The goal is to find a doormat that has no texture but an easy surface to hold the stones. Look for something with a sturdy backing as the stones will be heavy and you don\u2019t want them to fall when moving the mat. Measure the size you desire and then mark with the pencil. If you are satisfied with the size, you don\u2019t need to cut the mat."

Check to ensure no spaces are between stones or that you can see the mat. Design the mat to create a shape that closely resembles the mat shape you cut."
