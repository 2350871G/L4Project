  "text":" Wired Ribbon Small Roses Cut a 2/3-yard (.61 m) piece of 1 1/2-inch (3.81 cm) wide wire-rimmed ribbon. If you are using wider or narrower ribbons, adjust the length accordingly. Remember that you can easily cut off extra length, but it is difficult to correct a piece when you cut too short. Tie a knot in one end of the ribbon.  Gather the ribbon carefully by pulling the wire gently from its casing. If you pull too quickly, the wire may break, making the ribbon unusable for the project. Roll the gathered ribbon around the knot you tied in the end.  Wrap the excess wire around the rolled edges to secure the ribbon rose.  Folded Small Roses Cut two 1/2-yard (.46 m) lengths of 1/2-inch wide ribbon (1.27 cm).  Align the ribbons at one end, perpendicular to one another. Hand-stitch or glue the pieces to hold them together. Fold the ribbons across one another, alternating each length, to form a spring. Continue to the end of the ribbon lengths. Hold one ribbon end between your first two fingers. Gently pull the other ribbon away from your hand, gathering the ribbon folds to form the rosette. Hand-stitch or glue the ribbon rose end to the long piece of ribbon to secure the flower. Trim the extra ribbon. Fabric Small Roses Cut the fabric into 1 1/2-inch wide (3.81 cm) strips about 1 yard (.91 m) in length.  Fold the strips in half, with right sides together.  Stitch along the open side and one end, using a 1/2-inch seam allowance (1.27 cm) and leaving the other end open. Trim the seam allowance to 1/4 inch (.64 cm). Turn the strip right side out. Press the seam flat with your iron. Use either of the ribbon rose instructions to make miniature fabric roses. To follow the wired ribbon rose instructions, run a basting stitch along one edge of the strip.",
