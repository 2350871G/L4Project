If you\u2019re harvesting a large number of yucca blooms, it helps to have a bag that you can cut the flowers directly into it so you don\u2019t drop any."

Shake them to remove any insects that you might not have seen, and then wash under a fine mist or jet of water. Next, remove the center bulb, along with the stamens and pistils, from each flower because it has a bitter taste. If you want to keep the petals intact and are concerned about the washing process damaging them, you can also set them in a strainer inside a large bowl of water and let them soak. After washing the flowers, make sure to drain them carefully. Place them on paper towel to dry, so it can absorb any excess moisture."

Start with a base of your favorite greens, such as loose leaf or wild lettuce, and add some garden herbs. Mint, parsley, dill, and fennel are all good options. Finally, mix in some yucca flowers for color and flavor. You can leave the yucca flowers in tact as a garnish for the top of the salad, or toss the petals with the rest of the greens and herbs. A light salad dressing, such as a simple vinaigrette, works best with this type of salad. Mixing in other edible wild flowers, such as violets or dandelion petals, can add more color to your salad. Other garden herbs you may want to consider for the salad include cilantro, basil, chamomile, and chives."
