However, for health and safety reasons DO NOT practice these throws outside if the temperature is severely low or high, you are not comfortable with the current conditions, or the weather is too dangerous to be in for an extended period. Additionally, you may want someone to throw back and forth with, as retrieving your own throws can get quite tedious and boring!

  "text":" Equipment and Environment Using the proper Frisbee is vital to performing these throws correctly when one is a novice of ultimate Frisbee. The kind of Frisbee you want to use is one that is the 175 grams (6.2 oz), which is the official weight for the game of Ultimate Frisbee. There are plenty of companies that make official ultimate discs, but a few include Discraft, which seems to be the most popular, and Wham-O, who were the inventors of the original Frisbee Flying Disc.

Additionally, you may want someone to throw back and forth with, as retrieving your own throws can get quite tedious and boring! Now that we have gone over what we need to know before, we can move on to the mechanics. Backhand Stand with the foot that corresponds to your dominant hand (the hand you will be throwing with) forward.  Point your dominant shoulder in the direction you wish to throw.  Turn your head the direction you wish to throw. Basically, you will be standing parallel to the line of the Frisbee\u2019s flight. Spread your feet shoulders length apart and bend your knees slightly.  Grip the Frisbee in your dominant hand, with your thumb resting over the top of the disc, and your other four fingers.  Raise your throwing arm parallel to the ground and tuck the Frisbee into your chest. Your forearm and your wrist should be bent inwards. Step into your throw while keeping your toes pointed perpendicular to the direction of the throw.  Move your forearm and wrist outward in a quick throwing motion, while keeping your entire arm parallel to the ground, and your shoulder in place. Your shoulders should not move. Note: It is important during this step to keep your arm parallel to the ground, or the Frisbee will not fly flat and will veer off course. Release (quickly) the flying disc just before your entire arm is straight and in a locked position. The Frisbee should be out of your hand by the time your arm is in this position. Repeat and practice, practice, practice!  Forehand Stand with your non-dominant foot forward (the opposite of the foot used for a backhand throw).  Point the toes of your forward-facing foot slightly inward of your target, and the toes of your other foot perpendicular to the direction of the Frisbee\u2019s flight. This allows for the best balance and comfort while throwing the forehand. Point the shoulder of the arm you will not be using to throw toward your target.  Turn your head towards your target.  Spread your feet shoulders length apart and bend knees slightly.  Grip the disc with your thumb over the top and squeeze your middle and index fingers together then against the inside of the bottom lip so only the middle finger is touching the Frisbee, next squeeze your pinky and ring finger together and against the outside lip of the Frisbee so that your pinky and ring finger are clamping the lip against your middle and index finger.

Your upper arm should essentially be straight down. Bend your wrist back (outward) about 45 degrees.  Cock your forearm back slightly, preparing to throw.  Quickly move your forearm inward while simultaneously flicking your wrist towards your target. Keep your middle finger pressed against the bottom lip until you release the disc.
