In some variations, the first player is chosen once the cards are dealt, and it's based on the lowest card that is face-up. Shuffle 1 deck of cards for 2 players or 2 decks for more players. Shuffle the cards together 5-7 times to make sure they are thoroughly mixed. Make sure not to look at the cards as you're shuffling them! Note: You will need 2 decks for 3-5 players, as you will run out of cards too quickly otherwise. Deal 3 cards to each player face-down. Go around the table, putting 3 cards in front of each player in a row. Keep going around until each player has 3 cards in front of them. No one should look at these cards yet, even the player you dealt them to! Typically, you start dealing with the person on your left. Deal each person 6 cards face-down. Next, count out 6 cards for the person on your left, separate from the 3 you just dealt each person. Keep going around the table until everyone has 6 cards, including yourself.

These cards should be face-down. Beginning the Game Turn over 1 card from the draw pile to make the discard pile. If you're the dealer, place the card face-up to the side of the draw pile. That will be the starting card for the discard pile, and the player to the left of the dealer will play on it to start the game. One variation says the first player with a face-up 3 starts the game by playing a card from their hand. If no one has a 3, it moves to 4s.
