If there is no vegan or vegetarian section, look for items listed as \u201cFresh\u201d or \u201cLow Calorie\u201d instead, as they often contain items with no meat or animal byproducts. Some restaurants print animal-free options in a different color or mark them with a small symbol like a \u201cV\u201d or leaf. For large restaurants and chains, check their website for current menu offerings. For small eateries without a website, menus are often posted to Yelp or available at the restaurant itself. Avoid eating at restaurants with set menus since your options may be limited to non-vegan dishes."
