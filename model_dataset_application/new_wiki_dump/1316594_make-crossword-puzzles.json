In a US style crossword, there should be no \u201changing words,\u201d or words that do not connect to other words. Every letter should correspond to both an Across word and a Down word, and be totally interconnected. In a UK style crossword, hanging words are permitted. If the answer to a clue is a phrase rather than a single word, there should be no spaces between the words. You don\u2019t need to worry about capitalizing proper nouns in your answers, as crosswords are usually filled out in all caps. The answers should not include punctuation either. Many crossword puzzle creators automatically lay the words out for you. All you do is specify puzzle size and input the list of words and clues."
