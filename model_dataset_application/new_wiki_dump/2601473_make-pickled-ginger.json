          "description":"Fill a sink with hot water, and add about a teaspoon (5 ml) of liquid dish soap. Wash the jar and the lid in the soapy water to remove any dirt or pathogens. Rinse the jar and lid with hot water, and towel dry with a clean dish towel. Set the jar and lid aside. You can also wash and sterilize the jar and lid in a dishwasher. When the cycle is over, leave the door closed until you're ready to pack the ginger. The best type of jar for this recipe is a 1-pint (473-ml) mason jar with a new lid and ring. This type of setup is ideal for processing the jar in boiling water to help preserve the ginger for longer."

Press the side of the spoon against the ginger, apply gentle pressure, and scrape the skin to remove it. Just make sure you get into all the crevices and nooks as well. Young ginger is the best type of ginger for this recipe, because it has tender flesh and thin skin. Young ginger has smooth and tight skin, and the skin will peel away easily if you scrape it with a fingernail. The pink tips of young ginger are what give some pickled ginger varieties a pinkish color."

Slice the ginger widthwise rather than lengthwise, as this will produce slices that are less stringy and tough. If you don\u2019t have a mandolin, you can slice the ginger with a knife, or peel off slices with a vegetable peeler."

Wash a large radish and chop off the tip and tail. Cut the radish into slices that are about one-eighth inch (3 mm) thick."

If you added radish to the jar as well, the ginger will gradually take on the pinkish color from the radish skin. Canning the Pickled Ginger Place a cooling rack in the bottom of a large pot. You don\u2019t need a special canning pot to process foods for preservation, but you do need a pot large enough that a wire cooling rack will fit in the bottom. Place the rack in the bottom of the pot to keep the glass from touching the hot metal. If you have a special pot for canning, outfit the pot with the rack that came with it. Fill the pot with water and bring it to a boil. Add enough water so that the mason jar will be completely covered when you add it to the water. Put on a lid and heat the pot over medium-high heat until it\u2019s boiling. Process the jar in the boiling water for 15 minutes. When the water is boiling, use a pair of tongs to carefully lower the mason jar of ginger into the water. Put the lid back on, wait for the water to return to a boil, and then start the timer for 15 minutes.

Up to 6,000 feet (1,800 m), process the ginger for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat. When the jar has boiled for 15 minutes, cut the heat but leave the pot where it is. Remove the lid from the pot and leave the jar to stand for an additional five minutes in the water. Leaving the jar in the water as it cools will reduce the temperature shock between the boiling water bath and the outside air. Leave the jar to cool out of the water overnight. After five minutes, use a pair of tongs to carefully remove the jar from the water. Place the jar onto a heat-proof surface that\u2019s covered with a clean towel. Let the jar cool overnight, or for about 12 hours. Check that the lid is sealed. The next day, remove the ring from the mason jar. Press down on the lid with your finger and try to move the lid back and forth. If it doesn\u2019t move, gently try to lift the lid off with your finger. As long as the lid doesn\u2019t move or come off, you can store the ginger in a cool, dry place for up to a year. If the lid does move or lift off, you can either process the jar in a water bath again, or transfer it to the refrigerator for immediate use. Finished! ",
