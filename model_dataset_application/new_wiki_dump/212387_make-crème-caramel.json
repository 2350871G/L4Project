  "text":" Prepare the Custard Preheat the oven to 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C).  Heat the heavy cream and milk in a saucepan on medium heat until you see small bubbles on the sides of the pan.  Whisk 1/2 a cup of the sugar, egg yolks and eggs together in a medium bowl.  Whisk the hot cream and milk into the sugar and egg mixture.  Gradually add the hot milk and cream to the egg and sugar mixture. Stir in the salt and vanilla extract. Alternate method: Pass the mixture through a sieve and into a measuring cup, then stir in the salt and vanilla extract. Prepare the Caramel Place 6-oz ramekins in a deep baking dish and keep to one side.  Pour 1/2 cup sugar into a clean saucepan.  Add enough water to dissolve the sugar, and put the pot over high heat. Stir for one minute. Mix the caramel around to ensure it caramelizes evenly. As the water evaporates, the water will boil more furiously, and that's when it begins to caramelize. Pour the caramel into the ramekins you prepared earlier; do this when you see the caramel has turned dark brown.  Divide the mixture so that the bottom of each ramekin is covered with an even thin coat of the caramel.  Make the Cr\u00e8me Caramel Pour the custard into the caramel-bottomed ramekins, and fill the baking dish with water so that the bottom halves of the ramekins are under water. You may cover the dish with foil for only 15-20 minutes and then remove the foil. Leaving it on longer may cause the cream in the ramekins to get watery rather than the correct texture of a nice pudding. Bake until the custard is set, which should take around 20 to 45 minutes.  Let the custards cool down in the water bath. After they've cooled down, remove the ramekins from the baking dish, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. After the custard has been refrigerated, run a knife around the edge of each ramekin and invert the custard onto a nice plate, making sure you get all of the caramel out.  Served. ",
