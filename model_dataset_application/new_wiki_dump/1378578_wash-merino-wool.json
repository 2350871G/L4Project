Pick a shampoo, soap, or detergent that\u2019s especially formulated for wool, like Woolite or Laundress Wool & Cashmere Shampoo. Never use fabric softeners or products with bleach in them on wool. In a pinch, you can use a mild soap with a neutral pH, like a clear, fragrance-free dishwashing fluid for sensitive skin."

The water should be between 30 and 40 degrees C (about 85-100 degrees F). If you have a really large Merino wool product, consider washing it in your bathtub or using a \u201csoak\u201d setting on your washing machine so that you have a big enough basin."

Then, swish the water through the wool garment slowly and gently for about one minute. Don\u2019t let your wool soak for more than a handful of minutes since doing so can warp the fibers."

Never change temperatures for your rinse cycle. To avoid shrinkage and felting, you need to keep the temperature of your entire wash cycle constant.

Instead, lower the iron onto the fabric, press for a few seconds, and then lift it directly up. Repeat this process until you have the wrinkles out.
