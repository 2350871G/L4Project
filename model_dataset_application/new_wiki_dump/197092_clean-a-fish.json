To do so, cut a 1 inch (2.5 cm) notch right where the top of the fish's head meets its body. Then, gripping the fish from the head, peel the skin back to the tail. Rinse the flesh thoroughly when you\u2019re done. These fish, in particular, have a thick, unappealing skin that most people remove before cooking."
