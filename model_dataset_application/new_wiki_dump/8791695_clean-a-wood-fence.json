Go to your local hardware store and purchase enough plastic sheeting to cover the plants and grass up to at least 3 feet (0.91 m) from your wood fence. Purchase just enough plastic for one section and move it with you when you move to the next to save money."

Run a wire brush over any caked-on or large pieces of debris. Be careful not to scrub a wire brush into a painted fence too deeply. If you don\u2019t already have one, purchase a wire brush at a hardware or home improvement store. Substitute a plastic bristle scrub brush for a wire brush and use a little more pressure."
