          "description":"Any dust or dirt that covers your smoke detector or its internal sensor chamber can set it off when there is no fire. By cleaning the unit every couple of weeks, you may minimize the number of false alarms you experience or avoid them altogether. Make sure to dust or clean not only the outside cover of your unit, but also inside the cover, where dust often accumulates. You can use a dusting brush or vacuum the alarm with the soft brush attachment. If you are in a new home or having construction done, make sure that the electricians use a dust cover to keep the alarm from gathering debris."

          "description":"Insects may get caught in your alarm because they are attracted to the sound or even light that the unit may emit. If the alarm is going off with no smoke or visible fire, check for and for insects on the cover or sensor chamber."

          "headline":"Connect alarms as separate units.",
          "description":"If you have an interconnected system of fire alarms, a unit in another part of your home may be triggering connected fire alarms. Keep alarms on separate electrical currents to help prevent them from triggering one another. If your units are connected and there is no way to separate them from a power source, make sure to check for smoke so that you are sure there is no fire. Power interruptions may also trigger the alarm, especially if you live in an area where utility companies switch the grids."

          "description":"If your smoke alarm is on an AC or AC/DC electrical system, make sure to tighten any loose connections. This can help the unit avoid chirping or going off fully. Loose hot wire connections may occasionally disconnect power and this has the same effect as a power outage. If you are unsure of the wiring, contact an electrician to help you."

Installing your fire alarms at least 10 feet from a furnace or oven may minimize the number of false alarms you experience. Furnace blowers can blow debris from ductwork into your smoke alarm, making it go off. You may notice more false alarms in the fall when you first begin using the furnace after the summer."

Keeping your alarm away from cold air returns may prevent dusty air from blowing through the alarm and keep it from going into alarm mode. Place the alarm at least 10 feet from a cold air return."

Avoiding placing your smoke alarm in areas exposed to exhaust gases or open flames may help minimize or prevent false alarms. Note that in some areas heat detectors are required in garages. Contact your local fire department for more information. Do not locate smoke detectors near a fireplace or other open flame heating systems such as oil & gas furnaces."

Regular testing can help prevent a fire or damage to your home or family. Press the test button on the smoke detector. It may take a few seconds, but you should hear a loud and ear-piercing siren while the button is depressed. If there is no sound or weak sound, replace your batteries. Ask a family member to go into the farthest room from the alarm to make sure that anyone in the house can hear it. Light a match and blow it out directly under the alarm. After that, place the match in a glass of watch and make sure it\u2019s extinguished. If the alarm doesn\u2019t go off, you may need new batteries, new wiring, or a new unit."

This can help ensure that your home is fully protected from fire or smoke and may minimize the number of unpleasant false alarms. Most fire alarms in the United States fall into two categories: photoelectric and ionization models. Ionization models are better at detecting flaming fires, while photoelectric models react more quickly to smoldering fires. Although most homes have ionization models, most experts consider the photoelectric detector to be more effective. You can get dual models that may minimize false alarms."
