          "description":"Casually ask your parents when they will be going away, for how long, and where they will be going. You may not even have to ask these questions directly. Most likely, your parents will offer up the information to keep you in the loop of their schedule. If you need to, write down the information so you won't forget. If your parents are only going to be gone for an evening, like to dinner, and will be back in a few hours, you may not want to throw a party. The timing would be too rushed, and if your parents decided to come home early from dinner, you will not have time to clean up. If your parents are going away for the weekend or for an overnight trip, this is a perfect time to host a party."

          "headline":"Create a list of people you would like to invite to your party.",
          "description":"Pick the number of people you would like in your home for the party and try to stick it. Also, consider the size of your party space, like the living room, and only invite as many people as you can comfortably fit in that space. This will help minimize accidents like breaking furniture and will help keep the noise down. For example, if you want a small get-together, then consider only inviting 15-20 people to make the setting more intimate. If you want a large party for a large living space, consider increasing the list to 30 people and ask everyone to bring additional friends."

          "headline":"Send out discreet party invitations via text message, social media, or verbally.",
          "description":"Choose a single method to distribute the party information, or use a combination of methods. Just remember that you do not want other parents to find out you are hosting a party at your house, so choose a method you think will be the most discreet. For example, sending out a quick text message to your close friends or speaking with them in person is an easy way to inform a small or medium group of people for your party. Alternatively, you can create a private Facebook event online and invite large groups of people that way. Refrain from creating party flyers or paper invitations as these can easily wind up in the hands of a parent and ruin your plans."

          "headline":"Make sure your invitations are very specific to avoid any problems.",
          "description":"Include the date of the party, the time you want your guests to arrive, and your home address. You should also include an end time for the party if you need guests to be out of your house by a certain time. To avoid an unruly party with too many guests, state clearly on the invitations if your guests can bring people with them and, if so, how many. You can also note if you want your guests to bring snacks or drinks."

As you invite people to your party, ask them to carpool. Also, consider asking your guests to park away from your house along an adjacent street or a nearby parking lot. This will keep your block clear of cars and reduce the amount of attention drawn to your house."

Ideally, keep the party within your living room and kitchen, and give your guests access to 1 bathroom. This will speed up your cleaning process after the party, and will also deter any unwanted snooping from your guests. If possible, consider locking doors to rooms you don\u2019t want your guests to enter such as your parent\u2019s bedroom or the computer room, or post \u201cOff Limits\u201d signs on the doors. This will help alleviate worry and allow you to enjoy hosting the party."

Try to remember or write down where all of the items go because your parents will notice if something they see some thing are out of place. Take a picture of each room so you have something to look at when you're trying to put the room back together. This will relieve some of the stress of remembering where to put each item."

          "description":"Line coffee tables, end tables, dining room tables, and kitchen counters with disposable tablecloths to alleviate any mess created from the snacks and drinks you will be serving at your party. Similarly, consider lining expensive furniture like upholstered couches and chairs with simple, cotton drop cloths. This way, if someone spills a drink, the drop cloth will absorb most of the liquid. Disposable tablecloths and drop cloths can be purchased at a local party or department store, or online with major retailers. Make sure your bathroom is fully stocked with toilet paper."

Avoid mixing a communal punch bowl as this make a mess of your partying space and may encourage your guests to spike it with alcohol when no one is looking. If you do not have a cooler, then fill a large plastic bowl with ice and place the drinks into the bowl to chill."

This will give your guests something to munch on if they get hungry, but will also be easy for you to clean up after they leave. If you have time before your party, consider making some personalized snacks. For example, instead of purchasing a traditional party mix, make your own. Make a sweet party mix with pretzels, brown sugar, and chocolate candies, or make a barbecue flavored party mix by using your favorite cereal and barbecue sauce."

Instead, opt for serving your drinks and snacks in plastic cups, dishes, and bowls. Make sure to station a large garbage can in the kitchen so your guests can easily dispose of the plastic dishware as needed. Also, provide your guests with plenty of paper napkins or even a roll of paper towels in case someone spills a drink or needs to wipe their hands."

          "description":"Include popular radio hits, bouncy pop songs or classic dance songs like the \u201cCha Cha Slide\u201d on your playlist. Then, set up a stereo system in the room you will be hosting the party. Keep the stereo system off to the side of the dancing area where most of the people will be congregating. This way, it won\u2019t get knocked over or broken. Don\u2019t worry if you do not have fancy or expensive speakers. You can purchase small and inexpensive speakers at a local department store or online with major retailers, and then hook the speakers up to your cell phone or laptop."

That way, you can turn people away at the door if the party starts to get out of hand. If you are throwing a large party, try and speak with everyone who arrives and not just your close friends. If more people start showing up to your party than you initially invited, don\u2019t be afraid to turn them away.

Make sure that all of the curtains and blinds in your home are closed.

          "description":"Avoid having your neighbors file a noise complaint with the police by keeping the music volume down. If you can hear the music word-for-word outside of your house, then it is too loud. Remember, the louder your music is, the louder your guests will have to be to talk over it. This is especially important if you are hosting your party on a weekday. Neighbors will tend to be more forgiving about noise levels on the weekends, like on a Friday or Saturday night. However, since most people work on the weekdays, they might be less tolerable on a Sunday through Thursday night."

          "description":"Smaller get-togethers are fun but may require more of your attention to keep everyone engaged. An easy way to keep your friends chatting is through simple team games or activities. Most games, like \u201cNever Have I Ever\u201d and \u201cTrueAmerican\u201d can be arranged last-minute with household items and will provide hours of laughs and entertainment. If you or a friend has a fun card game, like \u201cApples to Apples\u201d or \u201cCards Against Humanity,\u201d have that nearby to play with everyone."

The smell of cigarettes and other vaping substances will linger long after the party is over. After the party, make sure to check outside of your home for cigarette butts and dispose of them. If your parents see them, it may draw unwanted suspicion."

If there are a lot of guests, enlist some of your friends to help you encourage people to leave when you need them to. Don't be afraid to tell people to leave! If it makes it easier, you can always say something like, \"My parents will be home soon, so I need to clear everyone ASAP.\""

Do not let your friends walk home alone in the dark intoxicated, and do not let them get behind the wheel. If needed, arrange a ride home for your intoxicated friend with someone at the party who is sober or through a local shuttle service. If you can\u2019t find a ride for your intoxicated guests, allow them to sleep over. Just make sure that you wake them up early enough, so they are gone by the time your parents get home."

Just make sure to stay focused while cleaning, and save chatting with your friends until after the house is put back together.

If needed, open a couple of windows to air out any smells that accumulated in your house. These smells include ones from your party and ones from the cleaning supplies. Avoid having your home look too clean. If your house normally has items lying around or dust on the coffee table, try to leave it that way. An overly clean house can raise just as much suspicion as a dirty one.
