  "text":" Steps Take a good amount of scallions. Remove the heads (as shown in picture above) and wash them, removing and loose layers from the top, slice larger for the chicken/sauce and smaller for the rice. Wash bell pepper, slice in half. Remove the seeds and the white insides and slice vertically to keep width, use picture as reference. Peel onion and slice in half. Cut the onion in thick pieces and remove layers by hand into bowl (as shown in picture below). Wash chicken, butterfly (meaning if the chicken is too thick, cut the thickness in half) then cut into 1 inch width sized strips. Make sure that everything else is cut before you continue with this step. Cutting meat on the same cutting board as the vegetables can contaminate the vegetables and cause food poisoning or other sickness. Cut the garlic and add  it to the bowl with the chicken.  Mix the soy sauce with the chicken. Add garlic and soy sauce to the bowl of chicken and mix thoroughly. Let that sit and marinate for about 15 minutes. Break all the eggs into a bowl and add a small amount of milk and the pinch of salt. Mix thoroughly with a whisk or a fork. Starting on a high flame, add canola oil to a pan and let it heat.
