          "description":"Although mangoes don\u2019t require much maintenance once planted, they do have particular circumstances under which they must grow. Mangoes thrive best in high heat, and can handle both humid/swampy or arid areas. Most mangoes are grown near the equator, and in the United States they are primarily grown in Florida. If you live in an area that has average temperatures of 80\u2013100 \u00b0F (27\u201338 \u00b0C) and cool winters that don\u2019t freeze, you\u2019ll likely be able to grow mangoes. Rainfall for your area should not exceed 12 inches (30.5 cm) per year."

          "description":"Mangoes can be grown in pots or in spacious areas outside. They prefer lots of heat and direct sunlight, meaning that they don\u2019t grow well indoors (although they can be brought in a pot for the winter). The size of each mango tree varies depending on what species it is, but they can get quite large, exceeding heights of 10\u201315 feet (3.0\u20134.6 m). Therefore, choose an area that will give your tree plenty of space to thrive without being shaded by other larger trees."

          "description":"There are many different types of mangoes on the market, but only a few grow well in specific areas. Visit a local nursery to find out which ones grow best in your area. Mangoes can be grown in one of two ways: via the seed of a mango, or from a grafted sapling. Mango seeds typically take eight years to produce fruit. Grafted saplings take three to five years to produce fruit and are nearly guaranteed a good harvest. If you choose to plant from a seed, choose a mango from a tree you know grows successfully in your area; taking one from a store-bought mango probably won\u2019t provide you with a tree. Grafted saplings will only reach about half the size of a tree grown from seed. The trees produced from seeds tend to be much stronger and hardier, but they may not be as reliable when it comes to fruit-bearing. If you\u2019re testing the environmental limits with your mango growing, there are a few species that are able to grow in slightly cooler and wetter conditions than the aforementioned recommendation."

          "headline":"Get your soil ready.",
          "description":"Mangoes thrive in loose, sandy soil that drains water easily. Check the pH of your soil to see if it is in an adequate acidity range; the trees will grow best in soil that has a pH of 4.5 \u2013 7 (acidic). Incorporate peat moss into your soil on a yearly basis in order to keep the acidity high. Avoid using chemical fertilizers or any product that contains salt, as these will hinder the growth of your mango tree. Prepare the soil so that it is tilled about three feet deep, as this will give plenty of space for the roots to spread."

The planting season will depend on the species, so check your local nursery to find out when yours should be planted. Some varieties, such as the Beverly and Keitt don\u2019t need to be planted until August/September."

If you don\u2019t have access to a healthy mango tree, visit a local grocer or farmer's market to select a fruit. Ask the salesperson for help in choosing a fruit that is polyembryonic. Polyembryonic seeds will produce clones of the parent tree. A polyembryonic seed should come from the fruit of a tree that thrives in your area.
