Or, a salsa garden with all of the ingredients needed to make salsa, such as cilantro, tomatoes, and peppers. Or, a tire garden where the plants are grown inside old tires. You can even do an ABC garden where each row of plants starts and continues with a certain letter, such as A. The A row could contain arugula or asparagus stalks. You can also create an herb garden with plants like rosemary and sage. Or, a flower garden with daisies, roses, and other beautiful blooming plants."

You will also want an area with adequate drainage or you could have flooding every time it rains. You can determine the quality of drainage in an area by watching what happens when it rains. Does the rain pool in certain areas or does it wash away slowly? Make sure that your garden does not fall under the drainage areas of your gutter or in a lower area in your yard."

For a healthy garden, you want to aim for a pH balance between 6.0 and 6.8."

You can suggest that they use \u201cX\u201d to mark where the plants will go. You can then sit down as a family and talk about how you want the garden to look when finished. For example, do your children prefer a garden with clean, spaced out rows or something a bit more natural and overlapping? You could also do a more organic design, such as a circle-shaped garden or one with wavy-line rows."

Your children may enjoy the process of physically choosing larger plants, but it is also fun to watch plants grow directly from seeds. It is often a good idea to go with a mix of both mature plants and seeds. Talk to a consultant at your local garden center to determine what types of plants will suit your garden\u2019s soil and sunlight exposure best. Choosing plants with similar needs makes sense, as your garden likely provides one kind of environment unless it\u2019s very large. If you will have children in the garden, then you may want to choose plants that are capable of surviving the curious little hands of kids. You will also want plants without thorns and ones that are not poisonous. Some great options are lavender or thornless roses."

All of these modifications will bring birds and other animals into the area, making for great entertainment for kids or birdwatching for adults. You can make a pond or water space kid-safe by adding a fence around it or by installing a metal grille or mesh system on top of it. Consult with a pond safety specialist for more guidance."
