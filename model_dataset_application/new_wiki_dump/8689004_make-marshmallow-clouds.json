Let the mixture sit to the side for a few minutes so the gelatin can bloom (hydrate). Try to get all the lumps out with the fork. You can also use extracts like raspberry, lemon, orange, almond, or banana, depending on what you want to do with the marshmallows."

Bring it to a boil over medium to high heat, and let it boil until it reaches 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 degrees Celsius) or just under. Continually wipe down the insides of the pan with a pastry brush to keep sugar from crystallizing there. Alternatively, you can let the sugar and water come to a boil, and take it off the heat. Corn syrup helps keep the mixture from crystallizing, meaning your marshmallows will usually stay softer."

Alternatively, if you just heated the mixture to boiling, add the gelatin to the pot. Heat it again until the mixture is boiling, stirring as it comes to a boil. Pour the mixture into the stand mixer, and let it cool down until it is just warm before going to the next step. If you prefer not to use gelatin, you can try agar in a one-to-one ratio with gelatin. Another option is Vegan Jel."
