Ask the seller about the profiles for their different coffee beans. A few characteristics that you want to keep in mind are:\n\nFlavor: Find green coffee beans with flavor profiles that sound good to you. If you like sweet things, look for beans that have flavors like chocolate, berry, and caramel. Acidity: Coffee that's more acidic tastes cleaner, crisper, and more refreshing. Body: The body of a coffee is how it feels in your mouth. Some coffees feel thick in the mouth, while others feel lighter and thinner. Balance: When a coffee is balanced, it means no one flavor stands out over the others. With a balanced coffee, you can enjoy all of the flavors in the roast equally. Complexity: Look for coffee beans that produce a complex roast if you want something with a lot of different flavors and characteristics. Complex coffees are multidimensional."
