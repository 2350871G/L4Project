Check the label to find out what the recommended wash settings are for your specific pair. Your jeans may already be pre-shrunk which could be indicated on the label as well. The washing label may be on the back of the waist of your jeans, or it could be on the inside near a pocket. You should only wash your jeans in the washing machine if the manufacturer recommends it. Otherwise, wash your jeans by hand."

Repeat that on the other side so your jeans are fully inside out. Turning your jeans inside out protects the outside denim and allows the dirtiest part to get washed."

          "description":"Hot water makes denim shrink, as does the intense spinning of a high spin cycle. Use a cold water cycle with a low spin setting to wash your jeans. Add some mild detergent that does not have any bleach in it to avoid damaging the fibers in the denim of your jeans.Tip: If your jeans are new, do not put them in the washer with any other clothes. Dark wash jeans can sometimes bleed their color onto other items. If you are worried about your detergent leaving residue on your jeans, use 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 44 mL) of vinegar instead. This will get rid of any smells naturally."

Leaving them for much longer could cause them to shrink. You can skip putting your jeans in the dryer if your washer spins out most of the water from them, but putting jeans in the dryer for a few minutes can get rid of any wrinkles or creases."

Hang your jeans on a clothesline or set them up on a clothes rack to dry the rest of the way. Depending on how thick the denim is, your jeans may need 1 to 2 days to dry fully. Your jeans may feel stiff after they are dry, but they will soften up once you put them on. Don't hang your jeans directly in the sun if you put them outside. This could cause them to fade faster."
