          "description":"You may only choose to have the service tackle particularly tough spots in your home, such as the kitchen and main bathroom. Some families will want the house cleaned from top to bottom. You\u2019ll also need to decide whether you expect services that may go beyond standard cleanings, such as wiping down the baseboards or washing the windows. Many services will not clean windows, as they don\u2019t want to create streaks or damage. You may need to turn to a professional for this. You may be able to choose different packages depending on the cleaning you need. If you get a standard cleaning, you can expect them to dust, wipe everything down, vacuum, and arrange your home. However, you wouldn't expect the person to clean the inside of the appliances or the nooks and crannies unless you requested a deep cleaning. You can also hire a cleaner for a move-in or move-out, which is similar to a deep cleaning, but it's tailored to someone who's preparing a property to move into or for a landlord review."

          "description":"Most cleaning services will ask you how big your house is, how many bedrooms and bathrooms it contains, and what kind of routine cleaning you usually do. One bedroom and one bathroom usually takes about two and a half hours to clean, and kitchens take another 1-2 hours. If you haven\u2019t cleaned in a while, these numbers may go up. Preparing this information for the service will help you both decide what you can afford.

Faris Mersi\t\t\tCleaning Entrepreneur & Founder, Pourti Agency\t\t\t\tConsider whether you want to hire an individual or a team. Cleaning entrepreneur Faris Mersi says: \"On average, most cleanings take around 2-2.5 hours, but it depends on the type of home and the size. If you have a large home or you're looking for a quick cleaning, it might be better to hire a team of 2-3 people to clean your home. However, solo cleaners are better if you want a recurring service, since they'll learn exactly what your home needs.\""

This option is generally better for families who may not have the time and legal knowledge to protect themselves from conflicts with individual employees. It\u2019s a good idea to ask potential cleaning services whether they\u2019ve performed background checks on their employees.

Establish arrival times with your cleaner, such as whether they'll arrive at a specific time or within a certain window.\" Tidy your house if you want the cleaner to focus on deep cleaning. It\u2019s a good idea to deal with general clutter on your own before the cleaners arrive. While cleaners will pick up and fold clothes left on the floor or put toys back in their designated area, this will take up their time and energy. This could mean that your house won\u2019t receive the deep clean it needs. If you\u2019re paying an hourly fee, it\u2019s especially important that you pick up your own clutter. EXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFaris Mersi\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCleaning Entrepreneur & Founder, Pourti Agency\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFaris Mersi is an entrepreneur in the cleaning industry and an expert on finding cleaning professionals.

Faris Mersi\t\t\tCleaning Entrepreneur & Founder, Pourti Agency\t\t\t\tStraightening up ahead of time allows your cleaner to be more efficient. Cleaning entrepreneur Faris Mersi says: \"Tidying up a little before the cleaner arrives can save you a bit of money, because then they can focus on the deep cleaning. For instance, if you have clothes lying around everywhere, you could pile them up in a corner, or you could have the cleaning supplies out and ready before they get there.\" Provide courteous feedback after the first few visits. You may have questions or suggestions after the first few times your cleaner comes. Discuss any areas of the home you\u2019d like cleaned slightly differently. Be sure to treat your cleaner as a professional who deserves both kindness and respect from you. If you\u2019re unsatisfied with the service, call the company directly. You can explain in detail exactly why you feel something isn\u2019t meeting your expectations. You\u2019ll likely be able to work out a more clear agreement with the company, which will be easier than starting over the process of finding a new service. Tip 10-20% to show your satisfaction with the cleaner. As with most service-based industries, cleaners depend on tips. Check on your company\u2019s policy, as they may roll tips into their overall fee and disperse them individually in paychecks. If not, it\u2019s expected that you\u2019ll show your appreciation of the service by tipping the cleaner directly. While there's no requirement or expectation for tipping, it's a nice way to let the cleaner know they did a good job.",
