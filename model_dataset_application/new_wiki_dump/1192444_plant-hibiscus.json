          "description":"Hibiscus come in a variety of colors and appearances, but what is more important than choosing the look of a hibiscus plant, is finding one that will thrive in your local environment. There are two general types of hibiscus bushes: tropical and hardy. Tropical hibiscus will grow in areas with warm weather and temperatures above 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) year-round. Hardy hibiscus are hybrids that have been developed to grow in cold areas whose temperatures may drop below freezing in the winter. Tropical hibiscus have more plentiful blooms, but they die off after only 1-2 days. They are typically in shades of pink, peach, and purple. Hardy hibiscus hold their blooms for longer than tropical hibiscus, but don\u2019t have as many and are more \u2018bushy\u2019. They generally come in hues of red, white, and pink."

          "description":"As with most flowering plants, there are three general ways you can grow your hibiscus: from seed, from a transplant, or from a cutting. Growing hibiscus from seed can be fun, because you can create an entirely new cultivar by crossing two existing varieties of hibiscus. On the other hand, growing from seed requires the most work, and may not be successful. If you\u2019re looking for ease and immediate results, you should find a pre-existing potted hibiscus to transplant into your garden. Growing from cuttings is the least likely to be successful, as it requires very specific conditions in order to work out. If you\u2019re new to gardening or growing hibiscus, avoid growing from cuttings. You may not have much variety of choice when growing from a pre-existing potted plant, as nurseries typically only carry a few varieties of hibiscus seedlings or transplants."

Wait until outdoor temperatures are consistently between 60\u201370 \u00b0F (16\u201321 \u00b0C) before considering planting. If the temperature drops to 55 degrees, the plant will stop growing. If it drops to 45 degrees or colder, the plant will die. This is less true for hardy varieties of hibiscus, but is still an important reminder of the necessity of heat for these plants.

          "description":"Hibiscus are sun-loving plants, but they can\u2019t handle too much direct sunlight without getting sunburned. Choose a location in your garden that gets 4-6 hours of direct sunlight a day, and ambient sunlight for the rest of the time. Typically this would be on the west or south side of your garden. The hibiscus can be shaded by larger trees if necessary, but will need space to spread out, as they may eventually take up two or three times the space of their original size. Some hibiscus plants have lived over 40 years, meaning that you could be dealing with a very large bush. Make sure you find a permanent location for your hibiscus to start. Try to find a location that has good drainage; water-pooling will drown out your hibiscus. On the other hand, avoid a location that is primarily sand. Make sure to test the soil\u2019s drainage and permeability before planting. To do this, dig a hole, pour a gallon of water in it, if the water doesn't disappear within an hour, then amend the soil to deal with the extra clay in it. If the water drains too quickly when you pour it in, then consider adding come clay."

          "description":"Hibiscus have picky soil requirements, so it is worth it to take time to amend the soil prior to planting them. Test the pH of your garden soil; hibiscus prefer acidic soil, so anything above 6.5 on the pH scale will have to be made more acidic. Additionally, you\u2019ll need to supplement the soil with plenty of nutrients and fertilizer. Mix in a garden compost several weeks (or months, if you have the time) prior to planting. You\u2019ll also want to add a fertilizer to the soil mix, that is low in phosphorus and high in potassium. If the pH of your soil is too basic, add in peat moss to balance it out. Common low-phosphorus/high-potassium fertilizers include a 10-4-12 mixture, or a 9-3-13 mixture."
