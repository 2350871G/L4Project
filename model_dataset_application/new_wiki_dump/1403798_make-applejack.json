Therefore, you want to sterilize all of your equipment, especially the five-gallon container. You can use an iodine solution, known as an iodophor, to sterilize everything. The solution is readily available from most home brewing outlets."

If the apple cider has reach over approximately 115-120 degrees Fahrenheit, then let it cool to this temperature before added the yeast. Temperatures over 130 degrees Fahrenheit will kill the yeast instead of activating it, and temperatures under 105 degrees Fahrenheit won\u2019t activate the yeast at all, so it\u2019s very important to add with the cider in the correct temperature window. Follow the directions on your particular packet of brewer\u2019s yeast for the amount of time the yeast should be kept at the activation temperature."

It needs to cool enough so that you can add it to the airtight five-gallon container without causing pressure issues as it cools.

Only add a little bit of the fourth gallon because the additions to the heated cider will result in a bit more than five total gallons, and you don\u2019t want to overflow the container. If you have a five-gallon container meant for brewing, that\u2019s great. If you don\u2019t, you can even use a five-gallon water jug.

Attach the airlock to the cap by following the instructions for the specific unit you purchased. You\u2019ll easily be able to find the device at the same home brewer\u2019s store where you found your yeast. The airlock will also require about an ounce of water inside it.

However, the longer you allow the yeast to feed, the higher the alcohol content of the applejack will be. Closer to ten days is going to give the applejack more bite. Especially if you\u2019re using a clear water jug, you want to store the container in a dark place because too much sunlight can kill the yeast. Give the container a tap once a day. You don\u2019t want to shake it hard\u2014just give it a tap or a rattle to send any gas in the liquid up to the surface to vent to keep from building too much pressure."

Make sure that you still have the caps in order to seal the one-gallon containers. Realistically, you can simply refrigerate the mixture at this point to kill the yeast, and you\u2019ll have an apple wine that is in the neighborhood of 40 proof\u201420% alcohol.

          "description":"After you have frozen the containers solid, open them, tip them upside down and let them drip into mason jars. Since water freezes at a much lower temperature than alcohol, the liquid that drips into the jars will be concentrated applejack as it separates from the still frozen water above. You will fill several jars as the content continues to melt and release more alcohol. You will visibly see the frozen portion losing its caramel color as the alcohol drains and leaves behind the ice. The process can take an hour and a half or two hours, so be patient. If you truly want to separate the water out as much as possible, then pour the contents of the jars back into the jugs once you\u2019ve dumped out the melted water and freeze them again. After two or three times through the distillation process, you\u2019ll notice that the contents don\u2019t freeze at all. Your applejack will be closer to 80 proof\u201440% alcohol\u2014when this happens."
