Add enough pieces to fill the pan, though don't crowd them too much. Cook the tikoy lightly on each side. Each side will only need a minute or 2, so make sure you flip the tikoy a minute or two after placing it in the pan. Check the other side after a minute or 2. It should be lightly browned before you pull it out. Pull the tikoy out of the pan. Line a plate with paper towels to absorb oil.
