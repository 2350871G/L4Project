Lychee fruit will be available during the typical lychee season, usually throughout May, June, and July in the Northern hemisphere. Make sure the fruit you get is fresh and completely ripe. The skin will be dark red, almost purple, and the bumps will flatten due to the amount of juice and sugar inside. Large seeds germinate better than smaller seeds. Seeds are only good for a few days once they\u2019ve been removed from the fruit, so plant them right away. Don\u2019t buy lychee fruit until you\u2019re ready."
