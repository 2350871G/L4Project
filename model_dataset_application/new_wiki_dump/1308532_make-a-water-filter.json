Try to make the sand layer about as thick as the charcoal layer. The bottle should be a little more than half-way full by now. Try using two types of sand: a fine grained sand and a coarse grained sand. The finer sand will go first, on top of the charcoal. The coarse grained sand will go next, on top of the fine-grained sand. This will create more layers for the water to pass through, and help make it cleaner."

Make sure that the jar is clean and large enough to hold the water you plan on filtering. If you don't have a jar, try using a bowl, cup, pot, or a mug. Hold the filter over the container. The cap should be pointing towards the bottom of the container. If your jar has a large opening, try setting the water filter down on top of it. This way, you won't need to hold the filter.

Do not leave the water standing for long, or new bacteria may form inside it. Making Other Types of Filters Make cloudy water clear again by pouring it through a coffee filter. Get a round, cup-shaped coffee filter and turn it upside down so that it fits over a cup like a lid. Wrap a rubber band around the coffee filter to keep it in place. Slowly pour the cloudy water over the coffee filter. Boil the water afterwards to make it drinkable. If you don't have a coffee filter, use a paper towel or a piece of cotton fabric instead.
