      "description":"The best way to approach the mission objective is on foot. Land vehicles are noisy and can attract unwanted attention, Aircrafts are also noisy and, unless their altitude is over 10.000 meters, they can easily show up on enemy radars. Parachuting over the objective is dangerous because there is no way to control the parachute and you might land in the middle of a group of enemies. Go prone (z) when you get close to the enemy objective because it makes it harder for enemies to detect you."

      "headline":"Approach enemies stealthily.",
      "description":"You don't need to get too close to an enemy for a successful execution, but when you want to slip past enemies without being detected, you need to know how close is too close. If you run (shift) towards the enemy you can get detected when you are 5.5 meters away from him. When you walk he will notice you when you are 4 meters away. Crouch walking (Page down) can get you within 3 meters of the enemy. When you are prone, you can get as close as 2.6 meters away from the enemy."

      "headline":"Choose your weapon based on what you will need for the mission.",
      "description":"Spetsnaz operators have only one suppressed weapon available: the PP-19 Bizon. The Bizon has a large magazine of 64 rounds and its effective range is 75 meters. Since it has a large magazine, the Bizon is deadly in full auto mode at close range and it can be used to lay down suppressive fire, but it's not as effective as light machine guns. This SMG has very poor accuracy due to high recoil and that makes it very unreliable even at medium range. Black Ops operators have 3 suppressed weapons available: the MP5SD, the Glock 17S, and the UZI. The MP5 has a magazine of 30 rounds, and its effective range is 195 meters. The MP5 has very little recoil even when firing full auto and it's very accurate at short and medium range. The suppressed G17 has a high rate of fire, low recoil, and a magazine of 14 rounds. Its effective range is 250 meters. The suppressed UZI is very similar to the PP-19 Bizon; it has an effective range of 70 meters, its magazine can hold up to 32 rounds. The UZI has high recoil but it has less spread and more accuracy and stopping power in its effective range than the Bizon. The UZI is designed for close range combat."

      "description":"When you are taking out an enemy who's by himself and there are no other enemies close and looking directly at him, you can safely kill him with a shot to the head or chest. But when enemies are close to each other and looking directly at each other, you need to take both of them quickly. If you kill one and take too long to kill the other, he will alarm other enemies nearby. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/86\\/Double-kill.jpg\\/460px-Double-kill.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/86\\/Double-kill.jpg\\/728px-Double-kill.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

      "headline":"Plant the bomb.",
      "description":"Black Ops and Spetsnaz operatives have satchel charges at their disposal. They are very powerful explosives capable of taking out large infantry groups, levelling buildings and destroying armored vehicles. Every operative starts out with 3 charges; to plant one, press the middle mouse button to bring up the action menu and select \"Put satchel charge\". To detonate a satchel charge instantaneously select \"Touch off bomb\"; otherwise you can select \"Set timer on\" to have the bomb explode in 30 seconds. Everytime you select the timer option when you are close to a satchel charge, you add more 30 seconds to the timer. Be careful not to be around these explosives when they go off; they have a blast radius of 35 meters. You can defuse a satchel charge by selecting \"Deactivate bomb\", this removes the charge and places it back in your inventory."

      "description":"The Laser Designator is issued to the Black Ops (Laser) loadout instead of night vision goggles. If you have someone providing Close Air Support with an A-10 LGB (Laser Guided Bombs) on your squad, you can use your laser designator to guide the bombs. Point the designator at your target and press the left mouse button; a diamond with a red dot will appear. Keep it pointed at the target and then press the quotation mark button; this will bring down the command menu. Look for the pilot's number in the squad bar on the bottom of the screen (if you are the squad leader you are number 1); eg if his number is 2, you press F2 to give him an order. Then press 2 for target and then select target laser. The pilot will fly over the target and drop a LGB. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6b\\/Engage-laser.jpg\\/460px-Engage-laser.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6b\\/Engage-laser.jpg\\/728px-Engage-laser.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nUnless someone uses a laser designator, AI pilots will never drop bombs; instead they will engage targets with the 30 millimeter cannon which fires HE shells."

      "headline":"Move carefully to the extraction point.",
      "description":"After you succeed with your main objective, most missions will have you go to an extraction point to successfully finish the mission. This can be tricky especially in assassination missions where you only kill 1 or 2 enemies and only stir up the rest. These enemies can come after you while you are trying to reach the safety of the extraction point. Keep calm and stay in prone position until you are out of the enemies' line of sight. Leave a satchel charge behind you if you can and when you are out of the blast radius, detonate it. If you hear footsteps behind you, try to find a hiding place and then ambush your pursuers."
