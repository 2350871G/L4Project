This will give your an instantaneous speed boost. Turn sharply at intersections to increase the distance between you and the cops. Drive in incoming lanes as the cops will be reluctant to follow you there. Do not stay in one area of the city for too long as this allows the cops time to call for backup. Keep ramming civilian cars, forcing the cops to stop and help them. When you start losing the cops, the pursuit bar will start filling up steadily towards the \u201cEvade\u201d end.

Once the CoolDown Bar empties, you will have successfully completed the pursuit and the points you have garnered will register."
