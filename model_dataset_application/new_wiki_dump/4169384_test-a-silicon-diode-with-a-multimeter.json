If the power is off but there is still voltage, you may need to discharge capacitors in the circuit. This is highly dangerous and should not be attempted by novices. If the diode is connected to other components in parallel, you may need to remove the diode from the circuit completely. This usually requires desoldering, then soldering it back once you're done testing."

Touch the leads together and listen for a tone that indicates continuity. If you do not hear anything, double check that your multimeter is on and set up correctly. If you do hear a tone, the function is working. Continue to the next step.
