When choosing meats, opt for high-quality sources that are grass-fed and free of antibiotics and growth hormones. This information is typically displayed on the packaging. White-meat poultry (31 grams of protein in three ounces) is a lean protein, which is especially healthy without the skin (which is high in saturated fat). Pork Tenderloin (3 grams of protein in three ounces) is not as lean as chicken, but it is becoming leaner\u2014now generally 31% leaner than it was 20 years ago. Lean beef (22 grams of protein in  three ounces) is a great source of nutrients like zinc, iron, and vitamin B12, and is also low in saturated fat, possessing only one more gram than skinless chicken."

          "description":"Seafood is typically high in protein but low in fat. Most fish and shellfish are a great source of protein, as well as all of the essential amino acids our bodies require. Shrimp (20 grams of protein in three ounces) are low in calories and contain key nutrients like vitamin B12 and antioxidants. Scallops (17 grams of protein in three ounces) are low fat and a good source of important vitamins and minerals. Filets of fish vary in protein content, but typically contain about one-third of the recommended daily amount in three ounces. Salmon, mahi-mahi, and especially tuna are popular choices as salad toppings, but any fish you like will do."

Most commonly, an egg is hardboiled and then diced or cut into wedges when adding it to a salad. If you feel like mixing it up, try topping your salad with a poached egg, a method used to make Salad Lyonnaise. The poached egg acts as a dressing-like sauce."
