It\u2019s important to use a saucepan with a heavy, or thick, bottom because this will help prevent the sugar from burning. Make sure you use heavy cream or heavy whipping cream, which both contain at least 36 percent butterfat. This fat quantity is required for the caramelization process."

As you wait for it to boil, brush down the sides of the saucepan with a pastry brush to remove as much sugar as possible. Brushing the excess sugar off the sides will help prevent the caramel from crystallizing."

When it reaches that temperature, remove it from the heat and stir in the vanilla. It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t stir the caramel as it heats up, because the agitation can encourage the growth of sugar crystals, which will turn your soft and chewy caramel into a grainy mess."

After you pour the caramel, you can sprinkle the top with a few pinches of salt if you want a salted caramel flavor. The salt complements the sweetness, and helps bring out the flavor of the caramel. Once the caramel has been poured, set it aside and let it cool to room temperature, about two hours."

This protects them from moisture, and from sticking together. For each caramel, cut a four-inch (10-cm) square of waxed paper, parchment paper, or plastic wrap. Wrap up each caramel square in an individual piece of paper, and then twist the ends to seal the caramel. Because of the milk in the recipe, room temperature caramels should be eaten within about three days."
