          "description":"Talking to another dog owner about picking up their dog\u2019s waste can be uncomfortable, but asking the owner directly to pick up after their dog will often work to fix the problem. There are many reasons people don\u2019t pick up after their dog. Maybe they think no one notices or that their actions (or non-actions in this case) don\u2019t directly affect those around them. Asking the person directly lets them know you, and others, have noticed their actions and are being affected negatively by them. Some people choose to leave notes or signs around their communities in hopes that the culprit will take notice and correct their actions. While this may work to create awareness of the problem, it may not persuade someone who doesn\u2019t believe they are doing anything wrong or who doesn\u2019t think anyone knows they are the culprit. If you are going to leave a sign, however, it may help to make it humorous. Some people respond better to funny or witty notes about picking up their dog\u2019s poop."

          "headline":"Use a friendly tone.",
          "description":"Although you are probably fed up and mad at a dog owner that isn\u2019t cleaning up after their dog, approach them in a friendly manner. Yelling at them may make them defensive and angry and will likely do more harm than good in resolving the issue. Don\u2019t confront them when you are angry. For example, maybe you just saw this person\u2019s dog go to the bathroom in your front yard and you witnessed the owner walk away without picking it up. If you are too angry to have a friendly conversation with them about it at this time, wait a few days and confront them once you have calmed down."

          "description":"It\u2019s possible this person doesn\u2019t realize how their neglect in picking up after their dog is negatively affecting those around them. When you ask them to pick up their dog\u2019s waste, give them a reason why you want them to do so. For example, say \u201cI know it can be unpleasant picking up after your dog, but my children play in our front yard often and I am afraid they might get sick from your dog\u2019s poop. Can you please pick up after your dog?\u201d"

          "headline":"Be honest.",
          "description":"When confronting someone on this issue, don\u2019t exaggerate the truth or make up reasons they should comply with your request. Be honest with them about why you want them to pick up after their dog and what could happen if they don\u2019t. For instance, don\u2019t tell someone that their failure to pick up after their dog is ruining the lives of everyone in the community. This is likely an exaggeration of the truth and may be brushed off as such. Instead, tell them that you are frustrated that you have to continually pick up their dog\u2019s poop to keep your kids from getting in it. Be honest about how their actions are negatively affecting your life. Hopefully they will relate to your truthfulness and change their ways."

When you ask them to pick up after their dog, be sure to let them know that this is a practice all dog owners in your community are expected to perform. It is not optional. You could say, \u201cWe take picking up after our dogs very seriously in this area. Everyone is held accountable for picking up after their pet and we, as a community, help enforce this policy. If this issue remains a problem, you could face a fine and nobody here wants it to come to that.\u201d"

          "description":"Another reason people might think it is okay to leave their dog\u2019s feces on the ground is that they believe it will break down naturally. This is not the case, however. Dog waste can actually take months or years to break down, and when it does it can deposit loads of toxins and bacteria into the soil. If you find someone who is not picking up after their dog, open up a conversation with them and discuss some of the reasons this is an unhealthy practice. Another common misconception people have about dog poop is that, like cow poop, it can be used as a fertilizer. They might also believe that the next rain will break down the feces and wash away any dangerous bacteria it carries. The fact is, the safest way to dispose of dog waste is to bag it and throw it away, every time."

Unfortunately, many dog owners may not be aware of these risks, and therefore, don\u2019t understand the implications of not picking up after their pet. Let them know how leaving feces on the ground can impact their health, their family\u2019s health, and the health of their dog. One gram of dog waste contains 23 million fecal bacteria. A dog can track a variety of dangerous pathogens into the home by stepping in their own waste. These pathogens can include a number of things like E. coli, giardia, and tapeworms."

Eventually, it will make its way into our rivers, lakes, oceans, and our drinking water.

If you see someone failing to pick up after their pet try saying something like this:  \u201cI notice you didn\u2019t pick up after your dog. Do you need a bag?

If your neighborhood or local dog park does not have bag dispensers, contact your local officials to suggest they be added. When contacting your local officials, calling their office may be more effective than writing a letter or email. Speaking in person about an issue at a community meeting can also be very effective. Whichever method you use, make sure you are polite, respectful, and provide suggestions on how to fix the issue instead of just complaining. Also, avoid sending a pre-written mass letter or email. These will most likely get a cookie-cutter response without receiving much attention. Finally, do your best to speak to someone specific. Research your officials and ask to speak to the person most likely to take action. Be prepared to support your request with information about the health and environmental risks dog waste can have.

If you run into someone facing these problems, suggest they use an alternative method. There are several types of devices made for these issues:\nThe most common device is a stick with a bag attached to the end. You simply scoop the waste into the bag from a standing position, tie the bag, and dispose of it. There are also bag-less products that suck the waste up through a tube. When you\u2019re ready to dispose of your dog\u2019s poop with these devices, you just press a button on the device and release the waste into a garbage can. For those who don\u2019t like to carry a poop bag around, there are products that allow you to clip to your dog\u2019s waste bag to its leash until you find a garbage can. Some of these products include the Poopy Carrier, The H-Clip, and The Fifth Paw. You can also make your own carrier by attaching the bag to the leash with a binder clip."
