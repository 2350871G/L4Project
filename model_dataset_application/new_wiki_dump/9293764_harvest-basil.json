If you leave more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the leaf node, the plant will divert nutrients to this stub and away from smaller shoots that need them. This can restrict the overall growth of the plant. Leaf nodes are the points on the plant where side shoots emerge. Aim to cut the stems about .25 inches (0.64 cm) above a node."

Trim away any buds you see on your plant before they have the chance to blossom. If you have harvested enough basil leaves and are ready to see your plant go, allow it to flower and enjoy the beauty.
