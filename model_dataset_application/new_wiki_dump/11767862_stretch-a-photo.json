If you want to maintain your photo's look, click to check the box next to \"Maintain aspect ratio.\" If you change the number for the horizontal or vertical size, the other dimension will automatically update to maintain the current aspect ratio of the photo. For example, if you choose to maintain the aspect ratio and update an original photo with the dimensions 100px x 100px to 75px, then the other field will update to 75px to maintain the original aspect ratio."
