Then, slowly pour these spices into the saucepan a little bit at a time to avoid having them spill out over the stove. If you want to add any other seasonings or flavorings, add these to the butter as well. Some other flavorings you might add to this mixture include \u20444 cup (59 mL) of Worcestershire sauce, \u20444 cup (59 mL) of lemon juice, 3/4 teaspoon (.6 grams) of crushed dried thyme, 1 cup (240 mL) of Italian dressing, \u20444 cup (59 mL) of garlic juice, or \u20444 cup (59 mL) of hot sauce."

It shouldn\u2019t take more than 3-5 minutes for the spices to completely mix with the butter."

This is necessary to ensure that there\u2019s nothing in this mixture that is too big to fit into your meat injector. For example, if you added Italian dressing to the mixture, you\u2019ll need to strain it to remove the chopped bell pepper pieces. This isn\u2019t usually necessary if you only added the basic spices. However, feel free to strain your mixture if you think you see any \u201cchunks\u201d in it!"

The time it will take for your spice mixture to cool down enough will vary. For the sake of safety, give it at least 10 minutes to sufficiently cool."

Be sure to place it in a container (e.g., a baking pan) that will collect the turkey juices as they melt; otherwise, these juices will contaminate whatever surface the turkey is resting on. To thaw a turkey out in the refrigerator, place it in a baking pan and leave it in the refrigerator for at least 2 days. Allow 24 hours of thawing time for every 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of turkey. You can also thaw out a turkey by submerging it in a bucket of cold water. Allow 30 minutes for every 1 pound (0.45 kg) of turkey to thaw it out completely. For your 10 lb (4.5 kg) turkey, leave it in the cold water for 5 hours to thaw it."

          "description":"Insert the tip of your injector into the spice mixture, then pull back slowly on the plunger in order to transfer the mixture into the injector. Inject your 10 lb (4.5 kg) turkey in as many places as possible, including the legs, back, wings, thighs, and breasts. Stick the needle all the way into the turkey when you inject the mixture to get the flavor as deep into the meat as possible. Inject the marinade under the skin of the turkey for best results. Don\u2019t skimp on injecting the mixture into the turkey. The more of it you inject, the juicier your turkey will turn out."

Spread the spice mix over as much of the turkey\u2019s body as possible to widely distribute the flavor. Most of the spice mixture should be injected into the turkey; you probably shouldn\u2019t use more than about 1/4 of the mixture at most on the outside of the bird."

Leaving it in the refrigerator overnight allows the turkey to fully marinate and incorporate the flavoring of the spice mixture. Although you can technically go straight from injecting the turkey to cooking it, it will taste much better if you allow it to marinate first."

This will allow you to carve off as much meat as possible. Serve the turkey on mildly heated plates to allow the meat to stay heated even longer. You can heat your plates by placing them in a 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C) for about 15 minutes. Use oven mitts when removing the plates, as they\u2019ll be hot to the touch at first.

Leaving it in the refrigerator overnight allows the turkey to fully marinate and incorporate the flavoring of the spice mixture. Although you can technically go straight from injecting the turkey to cooking it, it will taste much better if you allow it to marinate first. Frying the Turkey Fill your fryer \u2153 full with peanut oil and heat it to 365 \u00b0F (185 \u00b0C). The fryer needs to be full enough to completely submerge the turkey when you dip it, but not so full that the oil splashes out of it when it\u2019s operating. If your turkey is particularly large, you may need to fill the fryer halfway full. It can take up to an hour for the peanut oil in the turkey fryer to heat to the appropriate temperature, so be prepared to wait for a bit. Note that most deep fryers can\u2019t handle turkeys that weigh more than 20 pounds (9.1 kg). Remove the turkey from the bag and place it in the frying basket. This is the basket that came with your deep fryer. Place the turkey in the basket with the breast side up before you dip it in the oil. Feel free to throw away the turkey bag after this step; you\u2019ll no longer need it. Dip the turkey in the cooking oil so that it\u2019s completely submerged. Be sure to dip the turkey slowly into the oil so that it doesn\u2019t splash out of the fryer when you dip it. If possible, have a second person help you to lower the turkey into the oil to prevent you from accidentally dropping it. Cook the turkey in the oil for about 30 minutes. Set the cooking time for the turkey to be 3 minutes per 1 pound (0.45 kg). Leave the pot of the deep fryer uncovered and keep an eye on it to make sure the oil doesn\u2019t overflow and the turkey doesn\u2019t burn. Note that larger turkeys will usually have to be cooked for longer than 30 minutes. Remove the basket from the fryer and set it over a wire rack. Use the grab hook to slowly remove the basket from the fryer, taking care to not drip hot oil on yourself. Make sure you turn off the fryer after you\u2019ve removed the turkey. If possible, have someone help you lift the turkey out of the oil to make you less likely to accidentally drop it. Check the internal temperature of the turkey with a thermometer. The internal temperature should be 180 \u00b0F (82 \u00b0C) at the turkey\u2019s thigh. If it is below this temperature, put the turkey back in the fryer for 10-15 minutes. Then, repeat the process of removing the turkey and checking its temperature. Allow the turkey to drain over a wire rack for 20 minutes before serving. This will allow all the excess oil to drain off the turkey. Place the wire rack over a thick bed of paper towels to collect the oil. Carve and serve the fried turkey meat. Pull the legs, wings, and thighs off the turkey before using a large knife to carve the breast meat. Carve close to the body, especially along the turkey\u2019s back. This will allow you to carve off as much meat as possible. Serve the turkey on mildly heated plates to allow the meat to stay heated even longer. You can heat your plates by placing them in a 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C) for about 15 minutes. Use oven mitts when removing the plates, as they\u2019ll be hot to the touch at first. Allow them to cool for about 3-5 minutes. Place any leftover meat in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator or freezer. Leftover turkey will keep in the fridge for 3-4 days or in the freezer for 2-3 months. Finished. ",
