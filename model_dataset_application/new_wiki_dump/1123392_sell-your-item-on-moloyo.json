Sellers are given the opportunity to put a reserve on their auction item. If the item doesn't reach that reserve, the item doesn't sell, and all the bids spent by bidders are returned. It's only once a reserve has been met or surpassed that the item will actually sell at auction. Our reserve calculator takes your reserve and determines the Moloyo reserve of that item."
