If you live in Kentucky, you should expect the shipping times and rates to be different from someone who lives in Alaska. Where the store itself is located is a biggie too. A store in Hong Kong is WAY different from a store in California. Most websites give free shipping over $100 or $150, so that's a big help. Shipping and handling is a major fear of those who shop online. Many are worried they will receive broken guns or missing pieces or what not. This isn't always the stores fault. They don't handle your product once its out of their storage facility. Its all up to UPS or whatever to get your order to you intact and on time. So if you get a mashed box, don't complain straight to the website you bought it from. Unless of course you can prove the damage was caused before it shipped. However, it IS up to the seller to get you your product on time so that you will be satisfied with their service."

Someone who complains about their gun not reaching them in two weeks probably used bad information or there was a freak accident involving their product.

Then comes the shipping. It ain't $99 any more! An Asian retailer usually posts cheaper prices, because their country may actually manufacture that M24. Thus, it looks cheaper then it actually will be. Shipping to the US will cost money, and thus that M24 may end up costing $150 or so to get to you! But if you buy from that store located in the continental U.S., it would not only probably be cheaper, but it would be faster too. Imagine that M24 from Hong Kong to New York!
