  "text":" Knitting a Ruffled Poppy Choose size 4 or 5 US (3.5 or 3.75 mm) needles and yarn in any color. Use any color you like, although red is the traditional color for poppies. You'll need worsted weight (also called double knit) wool and a pair of straight needles in size 4 or 5 US (3.5 or 3.75 mm). For larger, frillier poppies, use the larger needles and size #4 wool.

Decrease the stitches for row 10 to leave 20 stitches on the needle. As you work across the 10th row, knit 2 stitches together. This will decrease the number of stitches by half.

Knit 2 stitches together as you work across row 15. This will reduce the number of stitches left on your needle and it will bring you close to the center of the poppy. Cut an 8 in (20 cm) tail and sew it through the 10 stitches on your needle. Thread the long tail through a tapestry needle and insert it through each of the stitches on the knitting needle. Slide them off as you go. Gather the yarn tail to form the center of the poppy. Pull the yarn tail tightly until the stitches gather together. This will make the middle of the poppy where you can attach a black center or button. Don't worry about how the center of the poppy looks since you'll be covering it with a knit strip of yarn or a button. Mattress stitch the edges of the poppy. Hold the center of the poppy and use your other hand to shape the petals of the poppy. You can twist and wrap the petals any way you like to create a poppy shape. Then use the tapestry needle to sew back and forth between the edges of the poppy to hold them in place.Tip: Leave the yarn tail long if you want to sew the poppy onto another project or trim the tail close to the edge if you want to keep the poppy as it is. Making a Flat Poppy Select a yarn in any color and size 4 or 5 US (3.5 or 3.75 mm) needles. Although red is the traditional color for a poppy, you could use any color yarn you like. Choose yarn that's worsted weight (also called double knit). You'll also need a pair of straight needles in size 4 or 5 US (3.5 or 3.75 mm).Did You Know? Using the smaller needles will make a tighter knit and slightly smaller poppy. Worsted weight is sometimes labeled as #4 weight. If you'd like a tighter knit, you can use light worsted weight yarn (#3). Cast on 60 stitches. Hold the yarn and make a slipknot. Then slip it onto one of the straight needles. Hold the needle with the yarn in your non-dominant hand and use the needle in your other hand to cast on 60 stitches. The size of the poppy will vary based on your knitting tension, the type of yarn you use, and the size of needles you're working with. Knit 10 rows of double rib stitch. To work this simple pattern, knit 2 stitches and then purl 2 stitches. Repeat this across each row for a total of 10 rows. If you want to make a slightly smaller poppy, do 8 rows of double rib stitch instead of 10. Once you finish the 10 rows, you'll have a thin rectangle of knit fabric on 1 needle. Decrease the stitches on row 11 to leave 30 stitches on the needle. To decrease the work, knit 2 stitches together. Repeat this across the entire row, so instead of having 60 stitches on the needle, you're left with just 30. The stitches will decrease as you work towards the center of the poppy. Decrease the stitches for row 12 to leave 10 stitches. Slip 1 stitch onto the other needle without knitting or purling it. Then insert the right needle through the next 2 stitches and knit it as though you're working a single stitch. Pull the stitch onto the right needle and use the left needle to pick up the slipped stitch. Pass the slipped stitch over the knit stitch you just made. Repeat these stitches across the row:\nSlip 1 stitch (s1), knit 2 stitches together (k2tog), and pass the slipped stitch over (psso). Cut a long yarn tail and sew it through the 10 stitches on your needle. Pull around 12 inches (30 cm) of the working yarn and cut it. You should be left with a long tail to thread through a tapestry needle. Insert the tapestry needle through each of the stitches that are on the knitting needle and slide them off as you go. Pull the yarn tail tight to make the center of the poppy. Once all of the stitches are attached to the tapestry needle, tug the yarn tail until the stitches gather together tightly. The space where they cinch will become the center of the poppy. It's important to pull tightly or there will be a gap in the middle of the poppy. This will make it difficult to add a black center or button. Mattress stitch the edges of the poppy. Hold the edges of the knit piece together so they form a poppy. Then use the tapestry needle to sew back and forth between the stitches on both edges so they're connected. If you want to give the poppy to someone or leave it as it is, trim the end of the yarn tail close to the end. If you want to attach it to another project, leave the tail long. This will allow you to sew it onto another piece of fabric. Knitting a Black Poppy Center Cast on 16 stitches with black yarn. Use the same needles you used to create the knit poppy. If you don't want to make a black center, use a different color of yarn that will stand out against the color you chose for the poppy.Variation: You don't have to knit a little center for the poppy. To save time, choose a small button that will fit in the center of the flower and sew it in place. Bind off all of the stitches. Since you only need a thin strip to make the center, knit the first 2 stitches and transfer them to your right needle. Insert the left needle into the first stitch you worked and then slip it over the other stitch on your right needle. Continue to knit a stitch and slip it over the other stitch until there aren't any stitches on the left needle. There should only be 1 stitch remaining on the right needle. Coil the yarn into a spiral and stitch it to the middle of the poppy. Cut the working yarn to leave a 12 in (30 cm) tail and thread it onto a tapestry needle. Then twist the strip of knitted yarn into a tight spiral. Hold it to the center of the poppy and sew it in place using the yarn tail.",
