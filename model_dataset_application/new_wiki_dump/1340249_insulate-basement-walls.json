          "description":"R-value is a measure of how well an insulation does its job of reducing hot or cold airflow. A higher R-value, per inch of thickness, indicates better insulation. The R-value you will need depends on the climate where your home is located and on how well insulated you\u2019d like your home to be. For example, if you live in a warm climate, you would want a minimum value of R-30. Cold climates would require a minimum value closer to R-60."

          "headline":"Evaluate your insulation options.",
          "description":"R-value will help you choose the level of insulation that you\u2019ll need. There are many basement insulation types. Three of the most popular types of insulation are batt-and-roll (blanket), loose-fill, and sprayed-foam. For blanket or batt-and-roll insulation, simply nail or staple the insulation into your wood frame. Blanket insulation is usually available in standard wall-frame sizes. For loose-fill insulation, install drywall over the studs before adding the loose-fill insulation. Sprayed-foam insulation is the most energy-efficient option for insulating a basement. It may be necessary to rent equipment to insulate your basement with wet-sprayed cellulose. This equipment is available at most major hardware stores. Sprayed foam can be open-cell or closed-cell. Open cell simply means there is air between the many bubbles made by the sprayed foam. Closed-cell, though slightly more expensive, is filled with non-air chemicals that are more efficient at insulation."

        {
          "headline":"Consider additional treatments for your insulation.",
          "description":"Additional treatments can help protect against moisture and can be more fire retardant. Faced insulation uses vapor barriers that control moisture movement between walls. Unfaced insulation does not have vapor barriers, but you might not need a vapor barrier if, for example, you\u2019re applying over existing installation or if moisture control is unnecessary. Fire-rated coverings are often necessary, since many types of insulation release toxic gases when ignited. Consult your local building code to see if this is necessary."

Consider using composite decking on the floor of the basement for extra moisture protection, or you could use a pressure-treated 2x4 bottom board. Otherwise, use standard wall-framing techniques to build the wall studs. Use a level to plumb the framed wall, and leave about a one-inch gap between the stud wall and your cinder blocks to provide plenty of space for insulation."

          "description":"Boards can include molded expanded polystyrene (MEPS), extruded expanded polystyrene (XEPS), or urethanes such as polyurethane. For a basement wall, XEPS is usually recommended since it\u2019s firmer and has a higher R-value than MEPS, which is the least expensive option but not as strong. The urethanes, another option, are solid and often used with plywood. A minimum of 1.5 inches of board thickness is usually recommended."

          "headline":"Add a vapor barrier.",
          "description":"This is an optional step, but some people like to add a vapor barrier between the fiberglass and the drywall. This is particularly recommended if the foam insulation board you initially installed is less than 1.5 inches thick. Concrete or block walls absorb moisture like a sponge, and will periodically release moisture toward your drywall, studs, and joists. The vapor barrier helps prevent moisture from causing mold to develop in your insulation, which can be very expensive to fix."

          "description":"Whether you use batt-and-roll insulation, loose-fill insulation, or sprayed-foam insulation, you do not want to leave the insulation exposed. You have many options for wall surfaces. Drywall is commonly used to cover the basement insulation, but if aesthetics are not a concern, you can also cover the insulation with plywood. Cover your insulation with drywall. Drywall usually comes in 4\u2019x8\u2019 sheets that you will need to measure and cut to fit your walls. When hanging drywall, start at a corner. Prepare the studs, joists, or strapping by applying glue to the surface immediately before you plan to hang the drywall. Then, use screws or a nail gun to nail the drywall. After all the drywall is hung, mix your mud and apply it with a putty knife along the seams between the drywall panels and in the corners. Cover these areas with drywall tape as well. After the mud dries, sand down and smooth over each mudded area. Alternatively, use plywood over your insulation. Plywood might require bending to cover up all of your insulation. This might involve laminating multiple pieces of plywood; steaming or soaking the plywood; or cutting kerfs (i.e. grooves) and reinforcing them with wood glue. Also, try to find plywood without knots, particularly in areas that are to be bent."

Use a heated hose to send the components through a mixture gun (a chemical reaction will begin immediately upon mixture), and spray onto the surfaces that need to be insulated. Spray about 2 inches (5 cm) on walls. Consult your energy codes, if any, but 2 inches (5.1 cm) on walls and 3 inches on rooflines is customary.

You\u2019re just trying to seal up the cracks to reinforce the insulation. Then, spray the open-cell foam upon the insulation areas. Alternatively, you could use caulk or Great Stuff, a polyurethane-based insulating foam, on the band boards and joists.

Apply open-cell foam in the same way that you apply closed-cell foam: with a heated hose and mixing gun. However, you\u2019ll likely use a thicker layer of open-cell foam since open-cell\u2019s R-value is lower. Use about a 3 to 5.5-inch-thick layer of open-cell foam. Fortunately, open-cell foam expands and fills framing cavities better than closed-cell foam. So, it will be easier to track your spraying progress."
