  "text":" Making the Dough Place flour, sugar, lemon zest, salt, and butter into a food processor. Process the mixture until crumbly. Add the egg yolks and lemon juice. Pulse just until the dough holds together. Add a tablespoon of water, if needed. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Bring it into a neat disk shape. Wrap tightly in plastic. Chill in the freezer for 15-20 minutes. Grease a 9\u201310 inch (22.9\u201325.4 cm) baking dish, with a removable base, or line with parchment paper.  Roll the dough out until it is thick as a pound coin.  Gently place it into the baking tin and trim the excess pastry. Make sure to leave an inch of overhang. Prick the pastry base with a fork. This prevents air pockets from creating bumps. Return the pastry to the freezer for 15 minutes to relax.  Baking the Pastry Preheat the oven to 180 \u00b0C (356 \u00b0F).  Cover the pastry with greaseproof paper. Fill the dish with baking beans. Put the pastry dish in the oven. Bake blind (cook the pastry with the beans in) for 15 minutes. Remove the baking beans. Return the dish to the oven for a further 10-12 minutes, or until pastry is looking golden. Allow the pastry to cool on the side.  Making the Filling Add the milk, cream, sugar, egg yolks, lemon zest, vanilla, and salt to a large bowl.  Add a third of the cream mixture to another bowl with the flour.  Mix together until smooth. Add the flour mixture to the cream mixture, whisking until smooth. Add the cream mixture to a saucepan over a medium heat.  Bring the cream mixture to the boil, whisking continuously.  Once the mixture has boiled, remove from the heat and add it to the pastry case.  Sprinkle the pistachios around onto the filling.  Baking the Pie Transfer the pie gently to the oven. Bake until the filling puffs up, 15-20 minutes, depending on the oven. Leave the tart to cool on rack to room temperature.  Chill in the fridge until the filling sets for about 3 hours. ",
