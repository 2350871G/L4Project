          "description":"Plug a male-to-male 3.5 mm RCA cable into the headphone and microphone jacks on your computer. Plugging one end into headphone jack will cause any audio you play on your computer to go through the cable. Plugging the other end into the microphone jack will allow whatever you're playing on your computer to be broadcast to anyone you stream with. You can get the appropriate cable from most music stores or large stores like Walmart."

This could be something like Skype, Twitch, Ustream.tv. If you want to broadcast to more than one person, you'll need either the premium Skype subscription or to use a streaming service that allows for group chats."

If you're interested in talk radio, you can record your own audio and then play it back directly from your recording software. Because you'll have a cable plugged in to the microphone and headphone jacks, anyone you stream with will hear the audio you play on your computer. Keep in mind that with your microphone jack occupied, though, you won't be able to add any live commentary without unplugging it each time."

Radioking.com, airtime.pro or looksomething.com only require that you pay for and log in to their services. You choose your audience size, the type of music you want to play, and the website does the rest.This is not necessarily the best option if you want to broadcast something other than music, because you can only choose the types of files that the website provides."

          "description":"To create a more professional sounding radio station than what you'll get with a basic streaming set up, you'll need software or apps. You'll need an app to play music or other audio, to turn your audio feed into an audio stream that can be broadcast, and one to act as your server. There are a lot of options for these types of apps and software, but the easiest to work with are Winamp (for playing audio files), Edcast (for turning your audio feed into a stream), and Icecast2 (for your server)."

This type of file keeps all of your mp3 files in one place and allows the other software you need to load the mp3s one at a time. This frees up memory and storage space on your computer. For an online radio station, you'll want to download lame_enc.dll. Type the DLL name into your favorite search engine, followed by \u201cdownload\u201d and it should pop up. This DLL will allow you to broadcast in mp3 formats, and is also compatible with older players you're your audience might use. This DLL will download as a zipped version, so you'll have to open the zipped file to access the individual files you need."

This basically makes the audio files on Winamp accessible to the other software you need to broadcast your radio station. To do this, find Winamp in the program files on your computer. Open the Winamp program file (C:/Program Files/Winamp) and insert the DLL file where it asks for the source."

          "description":"Once you have all of the software you need for your radio station, you'll need to figure out how many people you want in your audience. This will affect the size and type of server you need. It's probably best to start with a smaller number and change it if the radio station becomes more popular. Ten is usually a good start."

High quality mp3 broadcasts require an upload speed of about 192 kilobits per second (kpbs). Multiple this by the number of listeners you expect (or want). This will give you your radio station's required bandwidth. So, for example, if you want 10 listeners, your bandwidth would be 10 x 192 = 1920 kbps."

          "headline":"Consider a dedicated radio station server.",
          "description":"Most home internet connections have a maximum upload speed of around 500 mbps. This means you could really only broadcast to about two people, and you would be using up most of your upload speed on the station. If this is the case, you might want to consider getting a separate server. They cost around $6 per month for an ad-free option. You can also use a free server, but these will give your listeners ads. Some will just show the ads in their web browser instead of interrupting the audio coming from their radio station. Check out FreemStreamHosting.org for one example."
