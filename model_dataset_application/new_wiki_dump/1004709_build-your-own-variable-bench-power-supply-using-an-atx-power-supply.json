(Leave a few inches of wire on the connectors so that you can use them later on for other projects). Open up the power supply unit by removing the screws connecting the top and the bottom of the PSU case.  Bundle wires of the same colors together. The color code for the wires is: Red = +5V, Black = Ground (0V), White = -5V (not used), Yellow = +12V, Blue = -12V, Orange = +3.3V (not used except if you have a brown wire in your supply, Purple = +5V Standby (not used), Gray = power is on (output), and Green = Turn DC on (input). Start by drilling holes using a dremel tool or drill to the size of the banana jack post you are going to use. Also drill a hole for the LED, and also cut out square piece where the LCD will go and also drill room for a potentiometer with knob. Connect all the pieces together.

Build the voltage regulator circuit. Using the components gathered, build the following circuit on a circuit board, but solder wires to the potentiometer to make it out of circuit. By that i mean only the wires are to be attached to the pc board rather then the actual pot being soldered. This is because we are attaching the potentiometer to the case so that we can use it as a knob to turn it to adjust the voltage we want.

Attach build circuit board with some kind of liquid adhesive to the case so that it sticks to the side somewhere. Use hot glue to paste it. Attach potentiometer to drilled hole in case and paste it with the hot glue.  Attach V regulated wire out of the PC board onto the last empty post on your supply case and solder it onto it. This will be your regulated voltage coming out. Attach LCD voltmeter to case and then hook up power to the LCD using +12VDC supply from the bindings and hook up to ground and then hook up the +input to the regulated post and the - output to the ground post.
