Remove the outer layers of leaves, until you get to a layer where you can't see any visible dirt or wilted edges. Grasp the entire head of lettuce and run it under running water. Gently scrub the exterior of the lettuce with your fingers to remove any traces of dirt or pesticides. Do not soak your lettuce in a sink filled with water \u2013 this will not remove the dirt."

  "text":" Shredding Lettuce into Thin Strips Wash the lettuce. To be sure you aren't ingesting any dirt or pesticides, always wash produce before you prepare it. If the lettuce is marked \u201cready-to-eat,\u201d the FDA has certified that it is clean and can be eaten as it is, but some experts recommend washing it again when you get home.

Gently scrub the exterior of the lettuce with your fingers to remove any traces of dirt or pesticides. Do not soak your lettuce in a sink filled with water \u2013 this will not remove the dirt. Remove the tip of the lettuce head. The stalk of the lettuce tends to be tough and can have a bitter taste. Remove the pale, hard tip of the head and discard it. Also discard any of the outer leaves that appear wilted or discolored. Cut the head of lettuce in half. Put the lettuce on a clean chopping board and use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the head in half, through the root (or stalk). A classic chef's knife with an 8 to 10 inch (20 \u2013 25 cm) blade is recommended for chopping lettuce and most other vegetables. Cut the head into quarters. Set each half of the lettuce, cut side down, on the cutting board. Slice each half in half, through the root (stalk). Shred the quarter head into thin slices. Place the lettuce quarter-section on the cutting board with the outer leaves against the board and the cut edges facing up. Position the knife at the far, right edge of the lettuce and begin cutting with a back and forth sawing motion until you reach the cutting board. Move over approximately 1/4-inch and begin sawing again. The last piece of the head segment may be too small to slice safely.

Shredded lettuce will brown and wilt more quickly than lettuce that is left intact. Shredding Lettuce into Small Pieces Position the lettuce head on the cutting board. The top of the head should be facing down on the cutting board, and the stem of the lettuce will be facing up toward you. If you prefer your lettuce shredded finely, this can be easily done with any sharp chef's knife. Do the initial cutting. Set your knife on the edge of the head and slice straight through it, to create thin slices. Cut the lettuce carefully, using long, firm strokes. Cut to the core. Continue slicing until you reach the pale center of the head of lettuce. Stop slicing when you reach the core of the lettuce. Slice the other side of the lettuce head. Turn the head around and continue slicing on the other side until you reach the core. Stop cutting when you reach the core of the lettuce head. Remove the core from the head of lettuce. Lay the head of lettuce on its side and slice the top of the lettuce from the core, using a sharp chef's knife.

Continue turning and slicing the lettuce until it is as finely shredded and diced as you like. Shredding Lettuce with a Food Processor Assemble the food processor. If your processor allows you to select different blades and bowls, choose the correct ones for shredding lettuce. Ideally, you'll want a large bowl and an adjustable slicing disc. Adjust the settings on your food processor. To shred lettuce for a chopped salad, select a slicing disc that will create thick slices. Set the speed setting to \u201cslow.\u201d\nOn a KitchenAid food processor, the 6th notch on the slicing disc will produce the appropriate thickness. Wash the lettuce leaves. Remove the outer layers of leaves, until there is no dirt visible. Be sure to remove any leaves that have wilted. Run the entire head of lettuce under running water, and rub the surface gently with your fingers to remove any remaining dirt or pesticides on the leaves. If the lettuce is marked \u201cready-to-eat,\u201d it has been certified clean by the FDA. You can eat it as-is, or wash it again, just to be safe. Remove the stalk of the lettuce head.
