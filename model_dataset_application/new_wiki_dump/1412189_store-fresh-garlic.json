However, if the garlic oil is stored in the freezer, the risk of it developing this bacteria are removed. To safely store garlic in oil:\nYou can peel individual garlic cloves and completely submerge them in oil in a glass jar or plastic container. Tightly seal the jar or container with a lid and place directly into the freezer. Use a spoon to scoop out the garlic as needed. Alternatively, you can make a puree of garlic and olive oil by mixing one part peeled garlic cloves with two parts olive oil in a blender or food processor. Transfer the puree to a freezer-safe container with a tight-fitting lid and place in the freezer. This method is very convenient for cooks, as the oil prevents the puree from freezing so it can be scooped out and placed directly on a pan."

You can dry garlic in a food dehydrator by peeling the cloves and cutting them in half lengthwise. You should only use plump, unbruised cloves for dehydrating. Place them on the tray of your dehydrator and follow the manufacturers instructions for best heat settings. The garlic is completely dried when it becomes crisp and brittle.
