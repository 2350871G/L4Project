          "description":"Sandwiches are a go-to beach snack for many people, but they also tend to become \u201csand traps\u201d \u2014 either the sand blows in between the bread slices or parts of your sandwich fall out into the sand. Instead, try wrapping your favorite sandwich filling in a whole grain tortilla or flatbread, which will provide greater protection and easier handling. Peanut butter and jelly is a classic for kids, of course, but really any type of sandwich can become a wrap \u2014 just make sure to keep meats and cheeses cold throughout the day."

          "headline":"Avoid sticky fingers.",
          "description":"No matter what you do, sand is going to end up everywhere on you (and your stuff) during a beach day. If you're licking your fingers while eating cheese curls or even nibbling on pineapple spears, you're likely to end up with a sandy claw (and mouth) by the end of your snack. It's best to skip the fatty chips or cheese curls anyway, and if you're going with sticky fruit pieces, bring a fork to pick them out of a resealable container."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose whole fruits.",
          "description":"Whole fruits like bananas, oranges, and apples come with a built-in sand barrier \u2014 their skin. While cutting up your fruit beforehand may seem more convenient, keeping it whole will reduce sand infiltration. Peel a bit of the banana or orange, eat the goodness inside, then repeat. You'll reduce both stickiness and sand consumption. While whole berries are refreshing and tasty, they're also more likely to attract sand. Try making a mixed berry smoothie instead and keeping it cold in an insulated tumbler that's sealed with a lid."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Go for one-hand foods.",
          "description":"The more fingers you need to put on a food item to eat it, the more sand you're going to transfer to it. Big slices of watermelon that require both of your kid's hands to eat, for instance, are likely to turn their hands and face into pink-hued sand art. Wraps are easier to eat with one hand than sandwiches, and properly chilled grilled chicken or kebabs can also pack a handy protein punch."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Chomp on carrots and celery.",
          "description":"Fresh-cut veggies are one of the healthiest snack options at the beach or anywhere else. Some cut veggies, like cucumbers or even bell peppers, are moist enough to attract sand easily. Carrots and celery, though, tend to be dry enough to prevent looking like they've been breaded in sand for frying. Bring along some hummus or peanut butter for dipping, if desired. But expect to eat a bit more sand if you do!"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Simplify your salad with a lettuce wrap.",
          "description":"While a fresh salad that's bursting with veggie goodness is a filling and healthy snack option, it can also be a bit unwieldy to eat on the beach. Just like turning your sandwich into a wrap, though, you can condense and partially sand-proof your salad by wrapping your desired ingredients into a large lettuce leaf. Use a toothpick to keep your lettuce wrap together, if necessary. Just make sure you don't eat it!"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Steer clear of melty desserts.",
          "description":"Ice cream is another beach classic, despite the stickiness and messiness, but only if you can get it from a beachside stand. It's nearly impossible to keep it cold enough to prevent melting (or potential contamination) if you bring ice cream with you. Cookies may be a better option to satisfy your sweet tooth, but skip the melty chocolate chips or sand-attracting frostings or glazes. Consider peanut butter or oatmeal raisin cookies instead."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Stay hydrated with water.",
          "description":"Soda, iced tea, juice, and alcohol can all make appealing refreshment options when you're at the beach. However, the healthiest, most refreshing, and most convenient option is regular old water. Bring lots of water, keep it cold, and hydrate early and often throughout the day. This is especially important on a hot, sunny day, and for kids. Fresh fruits and veggies also provide some hydration, but make sure you're drinking enough water regardless."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Skip the greasy, fatty, salty foods.",
          "description":"Sure, it can be enticing to see a beach day as an excuse to \u201clet go\u201d and chow down on your favorite unhealthy foods. If you must do so, though, wait until the evening after your beach day. While you're on the beach, stick to lighter, healthier, and hydrating options. Lighter, healthier foods like fruits, veggies, and a grilled chicken lettuce wrap will leave you feeling more energetic, less bloated, and less likely to become dehydrated."

Chop up your carrot sticks, create your wraps, freeze what needs frozen, and individually bag your items the night before. Have your cooler bag ready to be filled with ice and your snacks so you can be out the door quickly."

          "headline":"Use water bottles as ice packs.",

Freeze the bottles overnight, and they'll thaw out throughout your beach day. Bring along one chilled but unfrozen water bottle so you can hydrate right away when you get to the beach. Don't rely on frozen water bottles alone if you're packing perishable snacks and/or a larger bag, but they can provide a nice supplementary chill."

          "headline":"Freeze foods to keep them cold.",
          "description":"Just like frozen water bottles, some foods can be frozen beforehand so that they end up the right temperature when you're ready for them. Frozen tubs or squeeze tubes of yogurt, for instance, will thaw out during the day and be chilled and ready to enjoy at snack time. Grapes and blueberries are also good options for freezing and thawing, although they will become even more sticky (and thus sand-attracting) this way."

          "headline":"Bag up your cut veggies with ice.",
          "description":"If you just want to toss a quick, small snack into the bottom of your beach bag, pair a frozen water bottle with a resealable bag filled with cut carrots and celery and ice cubes. The chilly environment will keep your veggies crisp and refreshing until you're ready to eat them. If sealed correctly, the baggie will also prevent leakage."

          "description":"Take a bit of time to plan things out before you start tossing snacks into your cooler. Any meats or dairy products in particular need to be kept cold right until you eat them. To manage this, layer your items in the cooler bag by temperature needs. For instance:\nPut a layer of ice or ice packs in the bottom of the cooler. Place perishables like deli wraps on top of the ice. Layer fruits and veggies on top of the meats and/or dairy. Add some frozen water bottles on top of the fruits and vegetables. Make non-perishables, like pretzels, your top layer. If you still have extra space, use a small towel or t-shirt to help hold in the chill."

        {
          "headline":"Practice food safety throughout the day.",
          "description":"No one wants their beach day to end with a bout of food poisoning. Keep cold foods cold all day long, clean your hands before eating, and, when in doubt, toss foods out. Do not mess around with perishable foods like meats and dairy. If they're not still cold, don't eat them. Keep your cooler in the shade and your food out of the sun. Only get out the food you're going to eat when you're going to eat it, and put the rest away promptly. Bring the supplies you need so you can clean your hands and clean up your area after eating."
