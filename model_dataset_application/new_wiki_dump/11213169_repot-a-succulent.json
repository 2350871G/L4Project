  "text":" Determining If Your Succulent Is Ready to Be Repotted Look at the bottom of your succulent's current pot. If you are able to see any roots, it's time to repot. Many succulents purchased from stores have been kept in their small containers for months and are rootbound. Rootbound is a condition where the roots are tightly packed at the bottom of the pot. Feel the soil. If your succulent isn't rootbound, but has gritty or hydrophobic soil, it needs to be repotted. Hydrophobic soil can be identified when the water seems to sit on top of the soil instead of being absorbed. Determine when you last repotted your succulent. If you have owned your succulent for two years and haven't repotted, it's time to repot. Gathering Supplies and Preparing Pick a new sized pot. Succulents prefer pots that are wide rather than deep. Most succulents have root systems that grow horizontally than vertically. The new pot should have a diameter that is 1 to 2 inches larger than its current pot. Check for drainage and consider material. Determine the drainage by looking for a hole at the very bottom, or at the sides of the pot. Terracotta pots are a popular choice for succulents, since they help keep the soil dry and prevent the roots from rotting. Any material of pot with proper drainage will suffice. Buy or make soil. Succulents need soil that will be able to dry out completely between watering. Many succulent owners mix their own soil. Consider acquiring other supplies such as gloves, a fork, and a first-aid kit.  Take off any stickers that are covering drainage holes.  Fill the pot about two-thirds of the way full. Press your finger in the center to create a hole. Removing the Succulent Squeeze firmly around the container to dislodge the root system if your succulent is in a plastic container.  Place your hand over the pot with the stem resting carefully in between your fingers.  Tip your pot over and let the succulent slide out with minimal pulling. If it does not come out, try squeezing the container again. If your succulent is not in a plastic container and still won't come out, use a fork to disturb the soil around the edges of the pot. Use thick gloves if your succulent has thorns. If poked, wash area, apply an anti-bacterial such as Neosporin, and apply a band-aid. Brush off as much dirt from the root system as possible before repotting. If your succulent is particularly rootbound, you may have to use a fork to separate the root system. Identify if there are pups with your succulent. A pup is a new growth that may share part of the root system with its mother plant. If the pup is at least one-third of its mother plant's height/size, then it can be separated and put in its own pot. Repotting the Succulent Gently place the succulent in the hole you made with the soil. If necessary, make the hole bigger to accommodate a large root system. Hold the succulent upright and in the middle of the pot. Pour more soil around it until the root system is covered and the succulent can stand on its own. Try not to pack the soil down too tightly or else your succulent may be more prone to root rot. Stake a Plant if it is leaning or dropping.  Providing Aftercare Give your succulent ample time to rest after repotting before watering or fertilizing. If the soil from the bag was moist, let it dry out before watering. Consider the pot material. If using terracotta, the soil will dry out faster than before, so you may have to use more water or water more frequently than with a plastic or glazed pot. Cut off any section of your succulent that was damaged in the repotting process. If it is brown and crisp or extremely wilted, throw it away. If it is a healthy cutting, try resting it on soil or Propagate Succulent Plant Cuttings",
