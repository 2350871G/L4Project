To achieve this temperature, you'll either need to find a local ceramics studio that rents out kiln space, or purchase an electric kiln yourself. An electric kiln often requires a new circuit, installed by an electrician. A kiln attached to the wrong voltage circuit may fail to reach the right temperatures."

Wear a respirator mask whenever you are handling or cleaning dust or sprays from the kiln, and always operate the kiln in a ventilated room.

Before you begin, read the operating instructions for the kiln, or ask advice from an experienced ceramicist or fused glass artist."

There are three common materials used to prevent this, both of which should be handled while wearing a respirator mask. This protection should be reapplied whenever it starts to look uneven, peeling, or falling apart. Glass separator (recommended) or kiln wash (adequate) can be purchased in powder form and mixed to a liquid. Brush it on in at least four coats, then wait for it to dry. Make the surface as even as possible, since tiny irregularities will show up in the glass. Alternatively, cut out kiln paper (fiber paper) to the shape of the shelf. Place it in the kiln and fire it at 1400\u00baF (760\u00baC) to blacken the paper, which can then be used as a protective surface between the glass and the shelf."

Most common wires will work, but aluminum will melt and copper and brass can leave flecks on the bottle."
