Look for printable cards for teachers online. See if there are printable cards that you can personalize- for example with your teacher's name on it, a certain image and size. That way, even if it's a printed card, it is personal. Pick several cards first, and compare them. If there is more than one card that you like, come up with a top five list."

Look at the motive- should it be school-related (a blackboard, or a school building), something timeless (flowers for example), or something funny?

          "description":"While most of the printable card designs are free, some are not. Check whether the card is free or not. Most often the website will tell you right away. Decide whether you want to pay for a card. If not, continue looking for free cards. Pay for the card using the safest method possible. If you are under 16, ask your parents first."

Look at your printer and see if all the cartridges are full (this applies only to ink printers). Check on the website whether the printing requires special instructions. Make sure you use the right paper size. Consider using colorful printing paper- this adds an extra touch of fun to your card. Use thicker printing paper- this will give your card the right feel."

While you wait, there are several things you can do. Think about what you could write  in the meantime. Look at how much space you have in the card, and whether there is a message inside already. Write your message on a regular piece of paper first. Print out the card several times in case you misspell something, your pen explodes or you don't fold neatly right away."

Re-read your draft- does it encompass what you want to say? Decide whether you want to use your draft, or re-write your message. Personalize the card- for example, draw a little flower or a heart inside the card or write your teacher's name with glitter pen! Write something personal on how your teacher has been important for you."

Think about something small that your teacher would like- this can be a piece of their favorite candy, a pretty flower, their favorite tea or coffee. Look around online. There are many websites with neat, extraordinary ideas. Decide what gift you'd like for your teacher. Wrap your gift or put a bow on it- it's again the gesture that counts. Add the gift to the card."

          "description":"This is the final step, and as important as the other steps. You need to decide when and how to deliver the card. Pick a time when your teacher is not too busy, after school is better than before, as they often are still prepping before class. Give them the card (and the gift if you have one). Smile and be friendly- this will only add to your card's message. Ask the administrative staff to put it in her mailbox- this is an option shyer students like to pursue.

Time goes fast, and things can take longer than expected, so be generous when you budget your time. Depending on whether you want to use a photo printing service, or whether you need to ask people for photos, start at least two weeks in advance. Compare prices of photo printing services- often you can get good deals if you look around carefully. Look at photo cards online and compare designs- this will make picking one easier for you later."

Ask other teachers, your friends and parents if you have trouble finding photos."

          "description":"Now that you have come up with a selection of high-quality pictures, you need to decide which ones should actually go into the card's design. Use pictures with as many smiles possible-memories of happy times will put your teacher in a good mood and make them smile! Decide on a number of pictures- too few can make the card look empty, too many will look crowded. Put the printed pictures together for a hand-made collage- this will help you visualize the final product."

Use a photo software for your collage, such as Photoshop, Picasa  or iPhoto  for example. These are the most common ones, but there are plenty of others, so look around! Consider using an online photo service. Common photo printing services include Snapfish  or Shutterfly for example. The downside is that they are not free and it takes time until the printed cards arrive."

Ensure that your printer has enough ink cartridges (if you are using an ink printer) or that the toner is full (if you are printing with a laser printer). Use photo paper to print the card.

Ask friends if they have instructions for designs. Make sure your friends are at roughly the same skill level as you are. Double-check on whether your friends are using their design- you don't want to look like a copy cat. Make a shortlist of about five different designs that you like."

Do you want a funny, a sentimental or a happy card? Look at the difficulty level- is it something you can do by yourself? Be honest with yourself and ask for help if it looks too hard."

Take stock of what you already have- sometimes you can use old items you don't need anymore. For example, you could use old crayola stumps to form your teacher's initials on the card. Go to an arts and crafts store to buy what you need - often the sales people have great ideas and can help, too!"

Write from the heart and be specific: What makes your teacher so special? Think about different ways of expressing your gratitude- a haiku for example,   or if it's for your French teacher, try it en fran\u00e7ais!"

Deliver the card after school- before school starts, teachers often have a lot of prep-work- you don't want to interrupt! Approach your teacher after class. Smile and say: \"This is for you, I made it!\" Send your card to school in the mail in a big, brightly colored envelope if you are shy or don't have time to deliver it in person. This will make your teacher feel extra special."

After a long day, this will make them smile! Making a Card Following Crafting Instructions Look for craft instructions for Teacher's Day cards. While there are a lot of crafting ideas and instructions around, finding the right one can be a bit like finding a needle in a haystack. Look online, in books, and magazines. Ask friends if they have instructions for designs. Make sure your friends are at roughly the same skill level as you are. Double-check on whether your friends are using their design- you don't want to look like a copy cat. Make a shortlist of about five different designs that you like. Pick a design that you like. When picking the card that you'd like to make for your teacher, think about different aspects, not just the final product:\nThink about what your card should express: does the design capture it? Do you want a funny, a sentimental or a happy card? Look at the difficulty level- is it something you can do by yourself? Be honest with yourself and ask for help if it looks too hard. Make a list of things you need. After you've picked your card, it's time to get to the next step in the planning phase. Read the instructions carefully, and if possible, compare with pictures or videos. See if there are tips and helpful hints in the instructions that you can use. Write the list noting how much of what material you need. Assemble the things you need. Once you have a list together, assemble your materials- see what you have and get the materials you still need. Take stock of what you already have- sometimes you can use old items you don't need anymore. For example, you could use old crayola stumps to form your teacher's initials on the card. Go to an arts and crafts store to buy what you need - often the sales people have great ideas and can help, too! Follow the instructions. This can be a bit of a tedious step, but in order to get the design and the card right, be extra diligent when it comes to following the instructions. Read every step carefully to make sure you know what to do. Take notes after you've completed your step- this can help you in the future. Ask someone for help if you are unsure of how you should do something. Write your card for Teacher's Day! This is one of the most important parts of the card- it verbalizes your appreciation, and underlines the visual message of the card. Write from the heart and be specific: What makes your teacher so special? Think about different ways of expressing your gratitude- a haiku for example,   or if it's for your French teacher, try it en fran\u00e7ais! Deliver the card. This is the last step, so make sure your delivery is perfect! Deliver the card after school- before school starts, teachers often have a lot of prep-work- you don't want to interrupt! Approach your teacher after class. Smile and say: \"This is for you, I made it!\" Send your card to school in the mail in a big, brightly colored envelope if you are shy or don't have time to deliver it in person. This will make your teacher feel extra special. Making a Card from Scratch Think about what your card should look like. This can be a daunting task- either you have a lot of ideas or none at all. However, you can find inspiration in many places. Be creative- how can you show what you are grateful for? Examples include a cut-out of your hand on colorful paper, apple/potato stamps, a pop-up-card- but there are no limits to your ideas! Look online on crafting forums for inspiration- even if you only find what you don't want to do! Bounce off ideas with friends or parents- good feedback is always helpful! Decide on a design. Here you need to be practical and think about what's doable and what is not. Evaluate your artistic abilities and time. What can realistically be accomplished? Think of your teacher first- what would they like? Maybe something that you don't like would appeal to them. Write a list of what you will need. Now that you've decided on what you'd like to do, think of what you have and what you need and write it down. Look around the house and see what you already have- old paper scraps could be re-purposed for shapes you want to glue to your card, for example. Ask friends and family for old materials they might discard otherwise, such as textile cloths or old crayons. Consider using different materials to layer the card, for example: markers, crayons, glitter, glue, stickers, pens, and paint. Assemble your materials for the card. Your list is complete, and all you have to do is buy your materials. Go to an arts and craft store instead of ordering materials online. The sales clerks at arts and craft stores create things everyday- they'll be happy to help and give you great tips! Line them up in the order you will need to use them. When you are in the process, preparation will save you time and energy. Make a draft before starting the final product. This step takes extra time, but it will be worth it in the end. Also, if your draft looks good, you can give it to another teacher! Put effort into the draft- it will give you ideas for the final product and tell you what works and what doesn't. Take notes during your draft- so that you know what worked and what did not. Write your own instructions. This may seem silly, but it's helpful to you and later to others, should you decide to share your instructions. Make a step-by-step list of things you need to do. This will help you to not forget anything important. Think about typing up your instructions and sharing them with others! Make your card. After all the preparations, it's time to make your card. Here is what to keep in mind:\nFollow your own instructions- to a t! Neatness and precision are essential when it comes to crafting a card for a teacher- it's another way of showing them that their lessons were appreciated. Draw, glue, paint your card. Pay attention to what you are doing- it's easy to make a mistake working with different materials. Evaluate the final product. You're done! Now it's time to look at your card and see if you like it, and more importantly, if your teacher would like it! Compare it with your draft- what is better, what is worse? Consider making a second card, to have a backup. Write the card. This is often perceived as the hardest part, as you don't want to be clich\u00e9d or trite in your words. Be honest and creative: tell them why they are great, but tell them in your own special way: For example, write your message in a secret code and leave them a clue. Be personal: If there is a special instance when they helped you or were nice mention that. The fact that you remember shows that you pay attention and your teacher will love it. Deliver the card. On to the home stretch! A beautifully delivered card underlines the content and makes your teacher happy. Hand deliver the card. Deliver the card when your teacher has a free moment and time to appreciate the card- that's after school most of the time. Smile when presenting it to your teacher- this will signal your true intentions to them. Watch your posture and enunciate your words properly- this shows confidence!",
