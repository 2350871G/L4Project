  "text":" Preparing the Sweet Potato Place peeled and chopped sweet potatoes in a saucepan, covered with salted water and bring the pot to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer the potatoes at a medium low temperature. Do this for about 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes and put into a bowl. Alternatively, you can roast the sweet potatoes. This will give them an extra flavor that you won't get with boiling them and it's a lot easier. Mash the sweet potatoes and mix in the cilantro, chili powder, and the salt.  Making the Quesadilla Heat the frozen corn in a microwave safe bowl and warm it up. With a high setting, it will take about 1 or 2 minutes. Spread about 1/4 cup of the sweet potato mixture onto a tortilla.  Cover the potatoes with 1/4 cup of the black beans.  Sprinkle on about a tablespoon of the corn.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup of your cheese over the quesadilla and cover with a tortilla.  Repeat the process until you have all 4 quesadillas.  Cooking the Quesadillas Spray a frying pan with cooking spray and heat over medium heat.  Put the quesadilla into the pan and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side.  Slice into quarters and serve.  Finished. ",
