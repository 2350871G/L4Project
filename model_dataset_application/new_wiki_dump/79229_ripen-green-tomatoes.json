Just pick up your plants and move them inside where it\u2019s warmer. Leave them near a window in direct sunlight. The warmer temperature and sunlight help the tomatoes continue ripening. Then pick tomatoes as they ripen and turn red. Tomato plants grow best when the temperature is around 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C), so make sure your home temperature is near that."

          "description":"If your tomato plants aren\u2019t potted and the season is ending, then you have to pick them or cover them until they ripen. Using a blanket or row cover helps ripen your plants in the last few days before the weather gets cold. Cover the entire tomato plant and make sure no parts are sticking out. Then check them every day and pick the ripe ones. Row covers are a better choice for this method because they\u2019re designed to keep plants warm. Buy them at garden stores or online. Take the covering off during the day so the plants get sunlight. This method also works if there is an unexpected early frost, but the weather is supposed to warm up afterward."

Start by digging around the plant roots with a gardening shovel. Then work the plant out of the ground, roots and all. Shake off all the dirt and debris from the plant so it doesn\u2019t make a mess in your home. If any tomatoes fall off while you\u2019re pulling the plant up, ripen them in a bag or box."

Use one that works best for you. Continue monitoring the tomatoes and pick them as they ripen. For the simplest solution, tie a string to a nail in your ceiling rafter. Then tie the string around the base of the plant and leave it hanging upside down. You can also punch a hole in the bottom of a bucket. Then tuck the plant through that hole and suspend the bucket from the ceiling. Place a sheet or pan beneath the plant to catch any falling dirt and leaves."
