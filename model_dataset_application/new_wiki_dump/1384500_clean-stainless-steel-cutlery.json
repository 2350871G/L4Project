          "description":"In a small saucer, dish, bowl, or container, mix baking soda and liquid dish soap until the two form a paste. This combination is excellent for breaking up tough dirtiness and difficult stains. A little bit goes a long way, and you can always mix more, so you may want to prepare a small amount first to prevent any going to waste. Use your finger or a stirring tool, like a spoon, to thoroughly mix the baking soda and soap until the paste is consistent throughout.

          "description":"You may want to clean your cutlery one at a time to ensure nothing is missed, or you may want to do all of it at once to save time. Gently scrub your paste into dirty areas with a nylon scrubber or a soft bristle brush to break up gunk and dirtiness. If you're trying to save time by cleaning your cutlery in a large batch, you may want to use a tub or bucket to hold silverware and contain your cleaning paste. Using this special cleaning paste is especially useful for removing scorch marks and dark spots from your cutlery. However, it may take some time and effort before the mark is removed."

If this is the case for you, use a clean nylon scrubber or soft bristle brush to scrub these away with undiluted white vinegar. The surface of your stainless steel utensils can become scratched and cloudy over time by abrasive cleaning tools. Even when using a nylon scrubber or soft bristle brush, clean dirty areas gently."

If, over the course of your drying, your towel has become especially wet, swap this out with a new one that's clean and dry."

In most cases, a normal cycle should be sufficient, but especially dirty flatware might require a heavy cycle. Turn off the drying cycle, if you are able. Then add a suitable detergent to your dishwasher, close its door, then start the washing cycle. To make it easier to return the cutlery to its place in your kitchen, you may want to separate your spoons, forks, and knives in your dishwasher. Some cutlery, especially certain kinds of spoons, can nest together in your dishwasher, making them difficult for your dishwasher to clean.

You can add a polishing agent to improve the end polish, like:\nOlive oil, which will help remove streaks from cutlery. Use a soft dishcloth, rag, or paper towel moistened with olive oil to gently rub your cutlery with it to remove streaks. Mineral oil, much like olive oil, helps to reduce streaking.
