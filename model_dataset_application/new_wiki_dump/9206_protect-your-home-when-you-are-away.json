They are also a direct link to a monitoring service. These systems act as a deterrent for intruders and are fairly easy to use..\nYou can have a home automation system installed that allows you to access a security system through a smart phone or computer application. Often a full security system would include outdoor cameras, automated lighting, and an alarm and monitoring system. These provide peace of mind whenever you\u2019re far away from your home. Installing a home security system may also reduce your homeowners\u2019 insurance payments."

Some homeowners worry that advertising their home security system will clue burglars in how to trick the system. If you put up a sign from a different company, you circumvent this risk. Even if you did not install a security system, you can and should still find a sign to put up in your yard as doing so may be enough to scare any potential burglars away. You can easily find these signs on most resale websites or auction websites."

If you have outdoor spaces, consider installing motion sensors that turn on a light when someone moves close. Consider adding motion sensors by any entryways like those on porches, decks, and by garages. Ensure that the light controlled by the sensor is bright enough to draw attention to anyone attempting to enter the home."

          "description":"Strong doors are a worthwhile investment as a deterrent for robberies. Ideally, they will be over 1 inch thick and be made of or clad in metal. Solid wood doors are also a good option. Your door should be strong enough that no one can break it down or kick it in. Not only will this increase security, it may also improve your home's energy efficiency. Good locks are useless if your door is easily broken! This may not be possible if you are renting your home or live in an apartment. If this is the case, speak with your landlord to see if they will consider installing more secure doors."

If you have sliding glass doors, install locks that wedge between the door and the track to ensure they cannot be opened from the outside. If you have window screens, add security latches to the screen. Window screens can be easily opened, but security latches add an additional layer of protection."

It is absolutely essential that you trust this person and know that they will follow through with checking in. A next door neighbor is a convenient person to monitor your home since they are the most likely person to notice any unusual situations. Do not sacrifice convenience for trust.

Go into areas where pipes are at a greater risk of freezing, like the attic and the basement, and check their insulation.
