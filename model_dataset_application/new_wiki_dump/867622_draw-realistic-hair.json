          "description":"It\u2019s hard to draw hair accurately without at least the outline of the head. You need to see how the hair flows in relation to the head as you\u2019re drawing. Use a reference photo and draw the outline of the person\u2019s head, including the top and sides (even if they\u2019re covered by hair). To draw a head without a reference photo, sketch an oval that\u2019s narrower at the bottom. Make sure you leave enough room on the page for the ends of the hair. You can adjust the shape of the chin later after you draw the hair."

          "description":"Start at the top of the head and draw the top and sides of the hair around it. Leave some space between the hair and the head since hair has volume and isn\u2019t perfectly flat. Then, draw the flow of the hair as it cascades down past the face and around where the neck and shoulders would be. The exact shape of the outline will depend on the style of the hair you\u2019re drawing. For straight long hair, draw a straight line on each side of the hair, running from the top of the hair to the ends. For wavy hair, use wavy lines to draw the sides of the hair\u2014the bigger you make the wavy lines, the looser the hair waves will look. For curly hair, just draw the outlines of the curls around the top, sides, and ends of the hair. Don\u2019t worry about drawing all of the individual curls yet."

Hair has different layers\u2014the layers in the back may only be partially visible behind the layers in the front. Textured or layered hair will have more visible sections. Hair that\u2019s flat and straight will have less. If you\u2019re drawing curly hair, the individual sections of hair will be really defined. Outline each of the curls within the hair."

If you\u2019re not, you\u2019ll need to decide where the light is coming from in your drawing. For example, if it\u2019s on the left side of your figure, the highlights would fall on the left side of the hair, and the right side would have more shadows. Outline the shapes of the visible highlights in the hair. Defining them now will make it easier to give the hair a realistic tone and value later on. For example, maybe the light is shining down on your figure, and the hair on the top of their head is reflecting the light. Look at the basic shape that this reflected light makes on the hair, and draw an outline of it in your drawing. The shape doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. You\u2019ll just use this as a reference later. The exact size and shape of the highlights will vary depending on the position and intensity of the light in your drawing. The more intense the light is, the bigger the highlights will be. Generally, highlights appear in thick, distinct sections, and the shapes flow in the same direction as the hair.Tip: If you\u2019re using a reference photo, you can upload it to a free image editing software and posterize it or increase the contrast. This will make the highlights and shadows in the hair more visible."

Then, go over the darker parts of the hair again, like any shadows at the roots or dark areas where pieces of hair overlap. Shading in the hair will help add dimension and make it look more real. Use different grades of pencils if you have them. For example, you could use an 8B for the darkest shadows, a 6B for medium-range shadows, and a 4B for everything else. You\u2019ll be able to create better contrast using a range of pencils."

Press down harder at darker sections of the hair, and lift up on your pencil as you go over the highlights. Use a kneaded eraser to add more highlights if the hair starts to get too dark. Flatten the eraser and swipe the tip across the page to make thin, white strands in the hair."
