Shadow Sphere is an object to be invisible for a short period of time, but still be aware of your surroundings. People with Illumina can detect you. You cannot use a sword while using Shadow Sphere. Armour, when worn, doubles your maximum health, although it does not double your current health, and gives you a shiny torso to let others know you have armor on. Jet Boots work when you click and hold down your while equipped, and to let go when you don't want to fly for the time being. When it is out of fuel, you drop down either into the sky or the ground, depending on where you were when the boots ran out of fuel. Venomshanks are sword longer than a Linked Sword (default sword). They are green all over it. When a player is hit with it, they are poisoned, and their health decreases for a period of time."

When equipped, the player's jump is higher and able to detect nearby invisible enemies. Sparkles come out of the sword, and it is white. Be careful, as Windforce and Firebrand will kill you instantly when attacked. Windforce pushes a target back when hit, but he/she is able to get back to safety using a touch stone. It is slightly bigger than a Linked Sword, and looks similar to Illumina. It is one of the swords that deal the most lunge damage."
