  "text":" Choosing the Pepper Strength Keep in mind that this dish is not the easiest to make, and not the quickest. You must have enough time and patience to go through all the steps. Decide whether you would like to have sweet, mild or hot ajvar. It's recommended that you make it either mild or hot, just because spicier is better and you are dealing with a bunch of red peppers after all, so it would make sense rather than to make it sweet.

For the mild flavor, if you are fortunate enough to find that kind of pepper, then good! If not, you may have to mix up hot and sweet peppers together to get that milder flavor. Preparing the Peppers Wash the peppers out and wait for them to dry. Depending in what type of climate you are surrounded by, you can either grill the peppers outside or cook them on a stove in your kitchen. There is no specific time while preparing these peppers, just sitting on top of them and watching their skin turn black and ready to peel. This is when you know they are ready. While cooking, flip the peppers carefully so there is char on all sides. Remove the skins. After all the cooking is done and you can see that the red peppers skins are black, immediately put these peppers in a container or plastic bag and tightly seal it. The reason doing so is to help keep the steam away from the skin of the peppers. When the peppers are cooled down, take them out of the bag or container and set them down on a kitchen table where they are ready to be peeled down. Carefully peel the unwanted black skin off the red peppers, then remove and discard the stem and seeds. Grind the cooked peppers in a grinder or processor. If you do not own a grinder, chop them up.

If you have a bigger batch, you may want to let the red peppers drain overnight. The purpose of draining is to remove as much excess and moisture from the peppers. Cooking the peppers Saut\u00e9 the red peppers and eggplant. Add vegetable oil, salt and any other type of spice you would like to mix it up with, if you choose to do so.

This means that the moisture is completely gone and it has reduced to somewhat of a paste. At this point, the red peppers should be a dark red color. Canning the cooked peppers Start the canning process. Have plenty of sterilized canning jars prepared ahead. Smaller jars are best. Put the cooked pepper paste into separate jars, filled up to the top while they are still hot. Put the lid on and allow it to cool down. You will hear a pinging noise; when this happens, it means that they are sealed tightly. Store the peppers. You have created possibly one of the best dishes you have ever made.",
