These would require 240 Volt, 40 Amp line, or 30 Amp for smaller steam generators. Electrician services may be needed in this step, in order to prevent electric shocks."

The steam generator uses cold water to generate steam. These connections will be 1/2\" flexible line connections in most cases. These flexible connections allow you to slide the steam shower to access the components and also for servicing."
