Here's how to do it:\nThread a needle with a long piece of strong thread or fishing line. Pierce the chilies just under their caps to thread the needle through them. Do this until all of the chilies have been threaded. Hang them in a well ventilated and sunny place in your home. In three days to a week, they\u2019ll be dry and ready to use."

Instead of keeping the chilies whole, slicing them helps them dry evenly and quickly. Follow these simple steps:\nSlice the cleaned chilies in half lengthwise. Lay them seed-side up on a baking sheet. Bake at 125 degrees F (or your lowest setting) for several hours. This is still a lengthy process but quicker than air drying. You could also use a food dehydrator for quick results."
