Most of the larger, reputable dealers belong to professional organizations, the foremost of which are the American Numismatic Association (https://www.money.org/find-a-dealer) and Professional Numismatists Guild (https://png.memberclicks.net/find-a-png-dealer). You can also check with the Better Business Bureau to find out how long the dealer has been in business and if complaints have been filed against the dealer. Remember, though, that a lack of complaints does not necessarily correlate to strong dealer ethics and business practices."

Bring coins that you think are rare or valuable and photographs of your collection (especially if it\u2019s substantial). Don\u2019t trust a dealer who\u2019s willing to make an appraisal or offer over the phone. Value depends on condition, so a dealer or appraiser needs to make a physical inspection in order to accurately value a coin. Most dealers will appraise your coins for free if you\u2019re negotiating a sale."

A dealer will offer a wholesale price, which could be 5 to 20 percent less than the retail value. You can find price guides and other valuation resources online.

If you find one that\u2019s well-advertised, well-attended, and has a history of good bids for coins, contact them and discuss putting your collection up for bid. Keep in mind you\u2019ll have to pay fees, and your item isn\u2019t guaranteed to sell at a fair market price. Auction fees are typically lower for higher value items, but can run between 30 and 50 percent. Live auctions are best for rare, collectible coins. An extremely rare coin could send 2 or more collectors into a bidding war, which might yield a selling price well above retail value."

Check the community forums on reputable numismatic organizations, such as the Professional Numismatists Guild and American Numismatic Association. You\u2019ll have to pay a membership fee to join an organization and post in the forum. If you can get in touch with a collector, you might be able to fetch a higher price than selling to a dealer or at an auction. A collector isn't likely to buy a coin that isn\u2019t professional graded, so you\u2019ll need to have your coins professional certified."

However, keep in mind any online transaction includes pros and cons. You\u2019ll need to spend money to have your coins graded, pay seller\u2019s fees, and deal with shipping. From standard seller\u2019s fees to shipping, selling on eBay will eat away at your time and profit margins. Selling on eBay can also be tough if you don't have a substantial history of positive reviews. Great Collections (https://www.greatcollections.com/) and Heritage Auctions (https://coins.ha.com/) are reputable large-scale markets with lower fees. If you\u2019re selling your coins in an online auction, there\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019ll fetch a fair market price."

You\u2019ll probably have a hard time finding a market for non-collectible coins, so selling them to a local smelter or scrap dealer might be your best option. Keep track of silver\u2019s market price, which fluctuates. If the market price is currently in a downward trend, wait until it ticks back up before you sell."

A reputable dealer who\u2019s a member of a collector\u2019s guild will probably offer a free appraisal if you\u2019re negotiating a sale.
