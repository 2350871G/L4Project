Reduce the heat to medium once the water or stock is nearly boiling. The liquid will begin to form small bubbles on the bottom of the pan. When these small bubbles begin to float to the surface, the liquid is about to boil and the heat should be reduced. If you are making chicken and dumplings, you will prepare chicken soup and then drop the dumplings into the soup mix instead of heating liquid for them separately."

Cover the pot while cooking to ensure that the dumplings heat evenly. This may require you to reduce the temperature slightly. When you think the dumplings are done cooking, you may want to remove one of the largest dumplings from the water/broth and cut it open to ensure that it is cooked through."

Just move the pot off of your cooktop and prepare to serve. Ladle the dumplings and broth into bowls. Keep any leftovers in an air-tight container in the refrigerator, and reheat on the stovetop."

If you do want to measure, the ratio of flour to water is typically 2 to 1, but you can always add more flour if your dough seems sticky or more water if it seems too dry. Add the flour to the water in a medium bowl. Mix together with a wooden spoon or a spatula until it begins to be sticky. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it by hand on a clean surface.
