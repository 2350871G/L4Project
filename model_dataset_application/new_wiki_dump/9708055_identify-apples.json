Patterns, also known as textures, can be streaked, spotted, blushed, smooth, russet, or uniform. If your apple is red with some yellow streaks or spots showing through, it might be a Cameo or Jonagold apple, and if it has more yellow than red, it could be a Gala apple."

For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, if an apple becomes ripe in August like the Earligold apple, it is an early apple, and you can rule out all apples that become ripe later in the season.

Others will have a distinctively shaped core that can help you narrow your search. For example, the Wealthy apple has a symmetrical core when cut in half. This means that both halves of the core will look the same when the apple is cut down the middle."

Some apples with the same coloring can taste very different. Some apples are very sweet and might even taste like other fruits, such as strawberries. Fuji, Gala, and Cameo are great examples of sweet apples. Others, like the Granny Smith, are incredibly sour or tart."

The thickness of the skin can also indicate the type of apple. An apple with thick skin is normally not good for cooking or baking. For example, Red Delicious apples have a very thick skin, which makes them best for using in salads or eating raw."

If there's a festival near you, you will be able to find a large number of apple enthusiasts and experts who can help you taste and experience different apples, or potentially identify an apple that you can't. Visit some of the stands and ask if they can help you find an apple variety that fits your needs, whether that's cooking, baking, or just a snack with lunch. If you have an apple that you can't identify, someone at the festival will probably be able to help you find a match."
