Then, use the hand you were pinching the napkin with to slide the ring over the napkin's folded end and pull it through. If possible, push your ring up the napkin until it's held in place by the bulk of the napkin. Not all napkins are thick enough for this \u2014 if yours isn't, just slide the ring up an inch or two and set the napkin down."

For added panache, give the smaller bottom part of the napkin a quick fluffing as well. Congratulations! You're done. Arrange your napkin as you wish. There are many different ways you can arrange your napkins for maximum impact \u2014 for instance, you may want to place your napkin directly on a plate to draw attention to it or put them all in a basket in the middle of the table so that your guests can grab them as they need them.

To start, lay your napkin flat and fold it in half. Press down on the fold to make a firm crease. Unfold the napkin. For this method, it's more important than normal to use a stiff, square cloth napkin. These sorts of napkins hold creases more easily than paper napkins, making your final \"fan\" shape look much sharper. In addition, if you don't use a square napkin, the dimensions of your fan may be off."

Aim to fit about four to six folds on each side of the central crease \u2014 the precise number doesn't matter. Press down to form creases as you go. When you're done, your folded-up napkin should be a long, skinny, \"accordion-ing\" strip. Note that your original crease should act as one of the folds in your \"accordion\". You may need to adjust the width of your folds slightly to get them to line up perfectly with the crease. Over time, this gets easier."
