          "headline":"Decide what your inspiration or style will be for the room.",
          "description":"Whether it\u2019s rustic, farmhouse, modern, or something entirely different, pick a design style to help you choose furniture, paint colors, and d\u00e9cor. This will help to make the room look cohesive and intentional, rather than a mix of different styles. Sometimes, you can get inspiration from a painting, a piece of furniture, or a quilt that you really love. Then, you can make it a focal point of your new room. Try looking at design websites like Architectural Digest, Better Homes and Gardens, or HGTV for inspiration. Save pictures of the rooms that you like so you can reference them later."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose an overall color scheme for your room.",
          "description":"Interior design relies a lot on color schemes, so pick 1 \u201cmain\u201d color to use throughout your room, like a neutral taupe, crisp white, muted gray, or pale pink. Then, choose 1-2 extra \u201caccent\u201d colors to complement your main color and add fun, eye-catching details. For example, if you\u2019re doing a bohemian theme, you might choose a light cream color for your main color, with bright pink, gold, and turquoise as your accent colors. If you\u2019re doing a farmhouse theme, you could choose crisp white for the main color, and use a french blue and bright yellow for your accent colors. Try using an item, such as a throw pillow or afghan, to help you choose colors for the room."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Paint the walls to transform your room with a new color.",
          "description":"Pick a main color to go on your walls, and remove all of the furniture from the room to repaint. Try to stick with your color scheme if you want to do multiple colors, and choose a shade that will complement many colors, even if your tastes change! If you want to add some interest to the room, paint one of the walls in your accent color to create depth! For a smaller room, you can pick brighter colors like light cream or white to make the room seem larger and brighter. Stick with neutral paint colors if you plan to incorporate bold, colorful d\u00e9cor, or if you plan to change out your d\u00e9cor often."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Repurpose and update your furniture to fit your new style.",
          "description":"It\u2019s surprisingly easy to refinish old furniture to give it a fresh look. You can paint wooden items, reupholster a thrifted chair, or decorate the headboard of your bed. This is a very budget-friendly idea because you don\u2019t have to buy new items. If you do want a few new pieces of furniture, visit a thrift store or look on Craigslist for cheap and free items that people don\u2019t want. Something as simple as draping a new throw blanket over a piece of furniture can update it."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Select a new bedding set and pillows that match your color scheme.",
          "description":"With your color scheme in mind, pick out a duvet or quilt, pillow shams and covers, and a few throw pillows for your bed. It\u2019s best to keep the quilt or duvet a solid color or simple pattern, and add pops of color with pillows. You can even lay a throw blanket in a complementary color across the end of the bed to pull everything together. For example, for a farmhouse theme using white walls with accent colors of blue, and yellow, you could have a blue duvet with pale yellow throw pillows. To save money, choose quality sheets and less expensive throw pillows and blankets."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Rearrange the furniture to give your space a new purpose.",
          "description":"Move the furniture that you have around in the room to test which setup makes the most sense for your room. Try to give yourself at least 3 feet (0.91 m) of walking space between pieces of furniture. This will help the room feel spacious and open, even if you have a lot of furniture. For a more open space, select a focal point for the room and position your furniture along the walls. If you want a more traditional look for your bedroom, position your headboard along a wall and place a nightstand on either side. For most rooms, it\u2019s best to place your dresser along an empty wall so that you have enough space to access it. To avoid moving objects around multiple times, sketch out the room and furniture to scale to see what type of arrangement works best."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pick a couple of lamps to brighten up the room.",
          "description":"Lighting is important for making your bedroom feel cozy and bright. Choose a set of matching lamps, and place one on your nightstand, with the other somewhere else in your room. If you have a second nightstand, you can place it there, or on the dresser. For a cozier feel, you can use string lights along your ceiling or hung between walls to give the room some ambient lighting. You can also add a brightly colored lamp shade for a pop of color that coordinates with your color scheme. For example, if you\u2019re doing a rustic or farmhouse theme, look for a lamp with a wooden base and a brightly colored lampshade. Switching out an overhead light fixture in a bedroom for a softer lighting option can also help to make the room seem more relaxing and romantic."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add some comfortable chairs to create a separate sitting area.",
          "description":"To make your bedroom multipurpose, designate an area for relaxing by setting up a comfortable chair and a small table. Look for a chair that\u2019s upholstered with an accent or neutral color, and pick a fun statement table. If you don\u2019t have a lot of space, you can make a seating area by positioning a small bench at the foot of your bed, or you can get a set of floor pillows to make sitting on the floor a bit more comfortable."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Hang up some artwork or a mirror on an empty wall.",
          "description":"To add some fun pieces to your room, position a piece of art or a mirror on an empty wall, like the wall above your bed. If you don\u2019t have space above your headboard, choose a wall that doesn\u2019t have anything on it. Look for pieces of art that match your general theme or color scheme. This will help to pull the room together. Hanging up pictures of family and friends can also help to make a room seem cozier and more inviting."

          "description":"For remodels that include an addition to the room, removing walls, or other structural changes to the home, it\u2019s best to set up an appointment with a professional contractor in your area. Normally, the contractor will come to your home, talk about the remodel with you, and survey the room to see what they\u2019re working with. Then, they\u2019ll give you an estimate for the cost of work and materials. When talking to a contractor, be as specific as possible about what you\u2019d like the room to look like. If you have inspiration pictures, show them. Keep in mind that while using a contractor is more expensive, they can save you time and ensure that the work is done properly."

Before you take on any project, make sure you have the proper tools and understand the risks. Do-it-yourself renovations can be a very stressful learning experience, and your project might not turn out exactly as you planned. If you start doing a project and find that you\u2019re in over your head, don\u2019t be afraid to contact a professional for help or advice."

If you\u2019re going to be re-doing a closet or expanding the room, be sure to include that area in your calculations. If you\u2019re doing a remodel that requires a lot of demolition, or you plan to add new flooring, add an additional $15-$30 per 1 foot (0.30 m) squared. The price will depend on what kind of flooring you\u2019re using or how you\u2019re doing the demolition. Keep in mind that doing demolition and renovations yourself will save you money. Then, you can hire a professional to do the parts of the renovation that you cannot do on your own."

Make sure the wall isn\u2019t load-bearing, and double check that removing it will provide the amount of space that you\u2019re looking for. This is also a great method for adding a larger closet or ensuite bathroom to your bedroom. Keep in mind that removing a bedroom or bathroom can negatively affect the value of your home. Before committing to combining 2 bedrooms, talk to an appraiser to see how the value of your home could change. If you don\u2019t want to remove a wall, then you could add a door between 2 adjacent rooms, such as a sliding barn door or pocket door. This will keep the rooms separate while providing more space."

Changing from carpet to wood can change the entire feel of the room. Making the switch from carpet to hardwood normally has a high return on investment, but it\u2019s important to do each step correctly to ensure that the flooring will last a long time. If you currently have older carpeting in your room, you might consider replacing it with new carpeting for a fresh look. Try to pick a neutral color that will match your desired theme. Compared to expanding the room or purchasing new furniture, replacing the floors can be pretty cheap and give the room a whole new look. If replacing the floors is not an option, then purchase a large area rug to cover them."

You can purchase these in a matching set, or find a mix of pieces from different stores. If you don\u2019t have a lot of closet space, you might consider getting an extra dresser or an armoire to hold your clothes. For mismatched furniture, search at places like antique stores and flea markets for unique pieces."
