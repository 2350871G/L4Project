Setting the Time Open the hinged glass cover of the clock\u2019s face to access the clock\u2019s hands.  Set the time by moving the big hand forward, pausing at the 11 o\u2019clock position.  Listen for the subtle sound of a spring unwinding before moving further.  Move the big hand to the 12 o\u2019clock position.  Pause and listen for the clock to strike the number of times indicated by the little hand. If the little hand is on 5 o\u2019clock, it should chime 5 times. Advance clockwise to the correct time. Make sure you repeat the pauses at the 11 o\u2019clock and 12 o\u2019clock positions as needed until the clock\u2019s face shows the correct time.
