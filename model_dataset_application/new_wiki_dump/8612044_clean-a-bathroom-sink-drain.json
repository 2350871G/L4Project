Most bathroom sinks feature an adjustable metal stopper than can be used to plug the sink. These can be removed by pulling them out of the drain. If your sink stopper is used by pushing and pulling a rod behind the faucet or is otherwise attached, remove the nut on the back of the drain pipe, pull out the retaining rod, then remove the stopper.

If your drain is removeable, you can put it in the dishwasher to get it really clean, then use a scrub brush or a magic eraser to get the buildup off the bottom. If it's not a removeable drain, scrub it thoroughly with a brush.\""

These are essentially long, thin strips of plastic with hooks on either side. Use it to break up and push or pull away any deposits that have clogged your drain. Keep inserting and removing the snake until no hair or clumps are attached to it when you pull it out. Alternatively, you can bend a metal coat hanger so it has a hook at 1 end and use that. If it gets stuck, pull it out with a pair of needle-nose pliers. Follow this with a baking soda and vinegar soak to remove unpleasant odors."
