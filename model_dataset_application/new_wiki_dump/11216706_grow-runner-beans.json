Some offer a traditional flavor, others are known for being highly ornamental, and some are dwarf varieties. Pick out 1 or 2 packets of dried seeds for the variety you\u2019d like to grow from a local garden center. Try the old and well-known Scarlet Emperor variety for a traditional flavor. Consider the White Lady or Painted Lady varieties for a decorative effect. These plants produce white or white and red flowers, respectively. If you\u2019d like to try growing beans that aren\u2019t green, try a variety like Blauhilde which produces purple bean pods."

Move the pots to a cold greenhouse or place them in a cold frame, and keep the glass open during the day but closed at night. Alternatively, place the pot outside along a south-facing wall during the day and return it inside at night.

Push the pole at least 6 in (15 cm) deep into the soil and jostle it around to open up space in the ground. Measure out the space between each cane, according to your chosen support style, before you start creating the holes.

Continue adding crisscrossed canes until you create a tunnel that covers the whole trench. Secure 1 or more horizontal canes over the top of the tunnel to provide stability.

Don\u2019t wait until the beam pods reach maturity; pick them when they\u2019re still tender, and when the seeds inside are relatively small. Snap off the bean pods gently to detach them from the vine. You can start harvesting in mid-summer if you sowed the seeds in spring, and you may be able to continue until the first frost in autumn.
