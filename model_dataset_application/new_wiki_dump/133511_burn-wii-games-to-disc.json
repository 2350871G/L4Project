Double-click the Cfg_USB_Loader_70.zip and navigate to the \"inSDroot\" folder. You'll see two folders: \"apps\" and \"usb-loader.\" Drag both of these folders into the root of your SD card.

This may take a while to complete, especially for newer, larger games. Select an installed game in CFG Loader. Once you have some games installed, they'll appear in the main CFG Loader window. Select one to view details and launch it. Press \"A\" to launch the game. With the game selected, press \"A\" to start playing. You'll see some text as the game loads, and then it will start. Continue installing games. You can keep installing games from any disc, legitimate or burned. All of the games will be added to your USB drive, and you won't need the discs to play them. Burning Games to Disc Consider using the USB Loader instead of burning your games. Besides the convenience that a USB Loader and external drive provide, newer Wii models cannot read DVD-R discs. This means that a burned disc is useless on Wiis that were made in 2008 or later. If you download games, you can copy them to the USB drive that your USB Loader uses and they will appear in your CFG Loader program library. You don't need to burn them just to rip them onto your Wii. Obtain some Wii game image files. If you do want to burn games to disc instead of using your USB Loader, you'll need the game image files. There are a couple of ways you can obtain these:\nWii and GameCube ISO files can be downloaded from many different torrent sites. See Download Torrents for details on finding and downloading torrents. It is illegal in most areas to download games you do not own. If you followed the above methods, you can use games that you've installed to your USB drive with CFG Loader. Plug the USB drive into your computer and open the \"games\" directory. Games will be named by their GAMEID, so perform a quick Google search if you're not sure which is which. Drag the file you want to your computer. It may take a while to copy. Convert image files copied from your USB drive. If you ripped games using your Wii and copied the files to your computer, you'll likely notice that the files are in WBFS format. This will need to be converted to ISO before you can burn it:\nVisit wbfstoiso.com and download the free program. Run the installer after downloading it and follow the prompts. No adware will be installed. Open WBFS to ISO and select your WBFS file. You can click the \"Open\" button to browse for it. Click \"Convert\" to begin converting the file. This may take a while to complete. You'll find the ISO file in the same location as your WBFS file. Visit imgburn.com and download ImgBurn. This disc burning utility will allow you to burn the ISO file to a blank DVD-/+R. Download the latest version from the ImgBurn website. Start the ImgBurn installation process. Double-click the installer to begin the installation. Uncheck the Ask Toolbar ads while installing. After you select the location to install ImgBurn, you'll see a screen for the Ask Toolbar. Make sure to uncheck all of the boxes before proceeding. Launch ImgBurn after installing. Once the installation is finished, launch ImgBurn from the shortcut on your desktop. Select \"Write image file to disc\" from the ImgBurn menu. This will open the disc writer tool. Insert a blank DVD+/-R disc into your DVD burner. You'll need to have a DVD burner installed for ImgBurn to work. Be aware that if your Wii is newer than 2008, the burned discs will not work. Select your Wii ISO file as the Source. Click the Browse button to navigate to it, or drag it into the window. Select a low write speed. To help ensure that the burn process works, select a slow writing speed such as 1X. This will result in a longer burn but will increase your chances of the disc working. Click the Burn button in the lower-left corner. This will begin writing the file to your disc. Wait for the burn to complete. This may take a while, especially for larger games. The disc will eject when it is finished. Load the game in your USB Loader. Once the disc is finished burning, you can load it in your USB Loader. This will allow you to play it without having to install any additional hacks. See the previous section for details.",
