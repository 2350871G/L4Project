  "text":" Preparing Cheese Mixture Smooth together 15 oz. (444 ml) of ricotta cheese and 4 oz. (118 ml) of cream cheese in a large bowl. Stir in 8 oz. (236 ml) of mozzarella cheese and 4 oz. (118 ml) Parmesan or Romano cheese. Fold in 2 large eggs.  Stir in 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) of salt and 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) pepper. Depending on your preference you can add a 10 oz. (296 ml) of package of frozen spinach that has been thawed and squeezed dry. You may also add 1 lb. (473 ml) of browned ground beef or Italian sausage to your cheese mixture. Even a small package of sliced pepperoni can be added at this point for a spicier manicotti recipe. Spoon the cheese mixture into a plastic storage bag and cut one corner.  Spread approximately 1 1/2 cups (355 ml) of marinara sauce, from a jar or homemade, into the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking dish.  Open 1 box of 12 to 14 uncooked manicotti shells.  Uncooked Shells Method Pipe the cheese mixture into each uncooked shell by squeezing the  plastic bag, forcing the cheese mixture through the hole that you cut.  Place each filled shell into the sauced baking dish, arranging them into 2 even rows.  Cooked Shells Method Boil the manicotti shells in a large pot of salted water for approximately 4 to 6 minutes until they are slightly softened, but still firm.  Drain the shells through a colander, taking care not to tear any of them.  Leave the shells in the colander and allow to cool slightly.  Remove 1 shell at a time and pipe in the cheese mixture.  Place each filled shell into the sauce lined baking dish, arranging them into 2 even rows.  Baking Manicotti Cover the filled shells (both uncooked and cooked methods) with 1 1/2 cups to 2 1/2 cups (355 ml to 591 ml) of marinara sauce.  Sprinkle 4 oz. (118 ml) of Parmesan or Romano cheese over the top. Bake at 350 degrees F (176 degrees C.) Bake the uncooked shells covered with foil for 50 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Bake the cooked shells uncovered for 30 to 35 minutes. Serve warm. ",
