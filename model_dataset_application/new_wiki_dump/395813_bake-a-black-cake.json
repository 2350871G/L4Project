The fruit must be soaked for at least a couple hours, but some people prefer soaking it for months before making the cake. Cut the prunes into quarters, and place them into a medium mixing bowl along with the raisins, currants, and mixed peel. You can substitute or add in dates (pitted and quartered), dried cherries, or any other dried fruit you like as well. Mix the cherry wine and rum in a small bowl. Pour one cup of the wine and rum mixture over the fruit. You can also add a few dashes of angostura bitters to the mix. Cover the remaining alcohol and set it aside. Stir the fruit and alcohol, cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap, and let it sit overnight. You can also let the fruit soak for a few days or weeks leading up to your baking. If you let it soak for longer than overnight, give it a stir every few days."
