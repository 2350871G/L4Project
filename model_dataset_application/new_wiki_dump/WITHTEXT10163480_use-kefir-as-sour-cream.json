Fermentation experts believe the best final product occurs when dairy products are sourced from grass-fed livestock. If it's convenient for you to get organic free-range heavy cream you should give it a shot as it's usually healthier."

You'll begin to see the cream begin to thicken as the grains react with the cream. Try to leave the mixture in a place where there is little traffic so that it's less likely to be disturbed. Usually the back of a cupboard or well out of the way of the most used stored items is ideal."

It will be thick and it will take time for the cream to come free of the grains. Use your spatula to push the cream through the strainer. This will help speed the process up."

If you store it somewhere at room temperature (approximately 68 \u00b0F (20 \u00b0C)) it will last for about 1-2 days. If you store it in a fridge (approximately 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C)) it will last for about 2-3 weeks, if not longer. If you store it in a freezer (usually 0 degrees) it will last for about 1-2 months, if not longer, however you will need to defrost it each time you bring it out of the freezer."
