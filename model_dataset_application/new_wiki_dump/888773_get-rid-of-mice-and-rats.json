Choose the trap that you like best, and make sure to place a highly desired piece of food properly in the trap to successfully attract the mouse or rat. Try a snap trap. These traps are set off by the removal of the bait. When the rodent attempts to take the snack that is carefully placed in the trap, the mechanism snaps a wire down and kills it nearly instantly by snapping the rodent\u2019s neck. To catch but not kill, choose a cage trap. When the mouse or rat steps on the pan located inside the trap, the treadle is tripped and the door closes. This traps the rodent without killing it. Avoid a sticky trap. This kind of trap has a special glue on it that sticks permanently to the rodent\u2019s feet. This is one of the least humane options because the trapped mouse or rat starves to death slowly."

  "text":" Trapping and Killing Mice and Rats Set up a trap with bait. There are many different types of traps that vary in terms of if and how they kill what they trap.

This is one of the least humane options because the trapped mouse or rat starves to death slowly. Poison the rodent. There are many different types of rodenticide, so pick the right one by assessing the environmental conditions and the severity of the infestation.
