          "description":"Most employers, training programs, and technical schools require at least a high school diploma or GED to progress towards further training. If you\u2019re in high school, graduate and obtain your diploma to move on. If you didn\u2019t finish high school, study and pass the GED exam to get your high school equivalent. If possible, try to get a job working in a wood shop or similar environment during high school. Even if you aren\u2019t working as a cabinet maker, any kind of hands-on work looks good to potential employers. Starting early can give you a significant head start on others. Depending on the state, you may also have to be 17 or 18 to begin working in the cabinet-making field, even as a trainee."

          "description":"Once you complete high school, you can get a job as an entry-level worker in a cabinet or woodworking shop. Usually, the only requirements are finishing high school and possessing basic hands-on skills. You\u2019ll work as an assistant to skilled craftsmen, and the duties will vary depending on the place you work. This is an important first step to becoming a full cabinet maker. Employers advertise these positions on normal job sites like Indeed or Monster, so start looking here. It\u2019s up to you whether you prefer to start working right out of high school, or move on to a technical school instead. With some hard work, you can do both by attending classes at night or working part-time. You don't need a technical school degree to find an entry-level job or apprenticeship, but it could help you stand out from other applicants and help your career advancement in the long-run. Apprentices typically make $12-15 per hour, depending on the location. If you work full-time, this equals about $25,000-$32,000 per year to start."

This means the industry recognizes you as capable of working independently. Your current employer may not be hiring for a skilled craftsman position. If this is the case, look for another job at a higher level. Usually direct job experience doesn't give you any official certification or title. However, it qualifies you to take exams for official qualifications if you want to advance your career. Skilled cabinet makers can make between $40,000 and $50,000 per year, depending on their skill level and area of operation. As you gain more work experience, you can ask for more pay."

Check if your state has a program like this, and apply for an apprenticeship in cabinet/furniture making, carpentry, or woodworking. Some apprenticeship programs also come along with classroom instruction. You may have to pay for the education, so always check any associated fees before enrolling.

In technical courses, they learn things like blueprint reading, math, architecture, regulations, and safety procedures. Look for technical schools or community colleges near you that offer woodworking, carpentry, or furniture-making certificates. These programs usually last 9 months to a year. After you complete the certification, you\u2019ll be able to qualify as a journeyman. Organize your schedule so you can work and go to school. Most technical programs meet at night to accommodate students who work during the day. These programs can range from $1,000-$10,000, depending on the school and the length of the program. Educational courses are usually not a requirement for getting a job, but these qualifications could make you more attractive for employers.

This would be satisfied through doing a program at a community college or technical school, or taking state-sponsored classes. In addition to the on-the-job training, this class instruction satisfies the other requirement of completing a state apprenticeship. After completing classwork and job training, you'll be a skilled craftsman. The amount of classwork varies from state-to-state, but about 144 hours is normal. If your state doesn't require classwork, it would still be a good career move to do some. Further education gives you more credentials and makes it easier to move on to new jobs. If you're doing a private apprenticeship rather than a state-sponsored one, classwork may not be a requirement. Getting a technical degree, however, can help advance your career later on."
