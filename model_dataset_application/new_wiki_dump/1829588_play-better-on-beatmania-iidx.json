      "description":"Class Mode is designed to help you to improve your coordination between eyes and fingers and adapting changes of BPMs by giving you 4 songs per class, each with gradually increasing difficulty, while Story Mode (or Step Up Mode on IIDX Lincle) can help you build your \"stamina\"."

    {
      "headline":"Use modifiers.",
      "description":"Modifiers that change scrolling speed such as HI-SPEED will help you to see notes better. Changing the scrolling speed means that the space between notes is larger, but this also means that the time for you to react is much more shorter, so watch out. Also, HARD or EX-HARD is very helpful. HARD or EX-HARD make the gauge increase more difficult and decrease at more rate than normal. This way, you can push yourself to the limit and slowly but sure, you will do better."

      "headline":"Play more songs.",

      "headline":"Play gradually.",
