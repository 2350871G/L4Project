Marcus Shields\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Owner, Maideasy\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: Consider doing a spot test before you clean the walls. It's a good idea to test your cleaner in a non-obvious corner of your wall to make sure that the paint doesn't come off when you're cleaning. Sometimes paint can abrade easily, especially if there are a lot of coats of paint on the wall, or if you're cleaning a chalk paint or latex-based, non-sheen paint"
