Identify a \u201cfavorite color\u201d corner and its two adjacent corner colors. Each corner of each side of a Gear Ball is next to corners from two other sides. So, once you pick out, for instance, a red corner to start with, you\u2019ll see that it is next to two corners with different colors\u2014for example, yellow and green.There\u2019s nothing special about red\u2014you can start with any of the six colors you prefer. It may make the process easier if you start with the same \u201cfavorite\u201d color each time, though. Create 2 matching pairs from 4 adjacent corners. The goal here is to have 2 corners (separated only by 1 side piece) of a face both be a single color (for example, red), and the 2 adjacent corners of an adjacent face both be another single color (for example, yellow).If, for example, you\u2019re holding the Gear Ball so that there\u2019s a red corner on top of a yellow corner to the left, you may be able to rotate the right side of the ball up or down until you have a red corner on top of a yellow corner to the right as well.

In this case, you\u2019ll need to rotate the right side of the ball either upward or downward 180 degrees in order to bring all 4 red corners into alignment in the same face. Relocate the center square that matches the color of your corners. For example, you might now have 4 red corners in a single face but have an orange center square. If the red square you seek is directly opposite the orange square (that is, facing away from you), rotate the right side of the ball around once (360 degrees) and the red square will move into place with the 4 red corners.Remember that, whether you\u2019re rotating up and down or side to side, the center section of the ball rotates half the amount of the side section. So, if you rotate the right side of the ball up and all the way around (360 degrees), the center section will rotate up and halfway around (180 degrees). In this example, then, the 2 red corners on the right will rotate all the way around and meet up with the red center square that has traveled halfway around. Bring the corners and centers of the other 5 faces into color alignment. The corners and center of the face directly opposite your \u201cfavorite color\u201d face (red, for example) will also now match (they might all be orange, for instance). Hold the ball with these corner-center matched faces at the top and bottom, and rotate the top left or right. Keep rotating until the other corners and centers match up.Eventually, you'll be able to match the colors of the corners and centers in each of the other 4 faces. At this point, the corners and centers will be the same color in each of the 6 faces. Aligning Interior Pieces with \u201cR2-U-R2-U\u201d Find a group of 4 interior pieces that need to switch locations. For instance, say the blue face is facing you, with the yellow face above and the purple face below it. However, say there\u2019s a yellow interior piece below the blue center and a purple one above it, as well as blue interior pieces at the bottom of the yellow face and the top of the purple face. In this case, you need all 4 of these interior pieces to switch locations.Once you\u2019ve solved all the centers and corners, you\u2019ll always find the above scenario somewhere on the ball\u2014but the grouping of colors may vary. Rotate the entire ball up 90 degrees (\u00bc turn). That is, the face that was pointing downward (for instance, purple) should now be pointed towards you. Likewise, according to the yellow-blue-purple example, the blue face will be pointed upward and the yellow face will be on the opposite side of the ball. Go through the \u201cR2-U-R2-U\u201d algorithm once. Rotate the right side of the ball upward 180 degrees (\u00bd turn) twice (\u201cR2\u201d), then rotate the upper side to the left 180 degrees (\u00bd turn) once (\u201cU\u201d). Then, repeat the process again\u2014so it\u2019s right-twice-up, right-twice-up or R2-U-R2-U.The interior pieces will now be in the correct vicinity, but still in the wrong faces. That is, according to the example, the purple interior piece will be at the bottom of the blue face, and the blue interior piece will be at the top of the purple face. Remember, each time you rotate the top, bottom, or side 180 degrees, the center rotates 90 degrees in the same direction. Find other sets of interiors to switch with R2-U-R2-U. For instance, you may find the same scenario you had with the yellow-blue-purple faces, this time by reorienting the ball so you have the red face above and the orange face below the blue face. Turn the ball up 90 degrees (\u00bc turn) so the orange face is towards you, then repeat the R2-U-R2-U algorithm to put the interior pieces in the proper vicinity.In some cases, using R2-U-R2-U will not only put the interior pieces in the proper vicinity, but also place them in the correct face as well (for example, yellow into yellow). Keep repeating this process until all the interior pieces are either in the proper face or are next to the proper face (that is, in the correct vicinity). Reorienting Interior Pieces with \u201cR-U-R-U-R-U\u201d Locate the 8 sets of interior pieces that need reoriented. At this point, there are only 2 scenarios: either all the interior pieces will already be in their proper faces (this is rare), or exactly 8 pairs of interior pieces will need to be flipped. Look over the ball to find the 8 pairs that need to be reoriented, then choose a pair to start with.For example, with the green face above the purple face, you might find that the bottom interior piece of the green face is purple, and the top interior piece of the purple face is green. This could be the first of your 8 mismatched pairs to fix. If all the interior pieces are already oriented (that is, none of them need switched because they\u2019re already in their proper faces), skip this entire section and move on to the \u201cR4\u201d algorithm section. Line up the 4 correct pairs in the \u201cstanding slice\u201d position. If 8 interior pairs are incorrectly oriented, that means 4 are correctly oriented. And, you\u2019ll be able to turn the ball so that these 4 pairs create a \u201cbelt\u201d that goes around the entire center section of the sphere. Position the ball so this \u201cbelt\u201d is facing up, down, left, and right, but not directly towards you.If the Gear Ball was a globe, and you were looking straight at the Prime Meridian, the belt would cross over the North and South Poles and follow the 90 deg East and 90 deg West longitudinal lines. This orientation is called a \u201cstanding slice.\u201d Turn the ball via the \u201cR-U-R-U-R-U\u201d algorithm once. With the 4 correct interior pairs in the \u201cstanding slice\u201d position, turn the right side of the ball up 180 degrees (\u00bd turn). Then, turn the upper side to the left 180 degrees (\u00bd turn). Repeat these turns 2 more times apiece.Once you\u2019ve completed the R-U-R-U-R-U algorithm, all the centers, corners, and interior pieces will be match in color within each face. Now, you just need to rotate some of the gear pieces into the correct orientation, and you\u2019ll be all finished! Using \u201cR4\u201d to Orient the Gear Rings Point an incorrectly-oriented gear ring towards you. For instance, the red half of the gear ring might be in the blue face, and the blue half in the red face. Hold the ball so that this mismatched gear ring is looking you straight in the eye.It\u2019s possible, but very unlikely, that all your gear rings will be in the proper orientation after you finish R-U-R-U-R-U. Look closely to make sure you don\u2019t miss any wayward gear rings! Use the gear ring\u2019s orientation to determine your \u201cR4\u201d turn. The 2 colors in the gear ring are separated by a thin black line. This line will either divide the gear ring from top right to bottom left (\u201c/\u201d), or from top left to bottom right (\u201c\\\u201d). Take note of this orientation to figure out which direction you should turn the Gear Ball next.If you have this line (\u201c/\u201d) you\u2019ll turn R4 upward. If you have this line (\u201c\\\u201d) you\u2019ll turn R4 downward. Rotate the right side of the ball upward or downward 4 times. This is the very simple \u201cR4\u201d algorithm. Rotate the right side 180 degrees (\u00bd turn) each time, upward if you have (\u201c/\u201d) and downward if you have (\u201c\\\u201d). The gear ring will be in the proper alignment after you complete the fourth turn.For example, the red side of the gear ring will be in the red face, and the blue side in the blue face. As a bonus, all the other gear rings in the same vertical slice\u2014the \u201cbelt\u201d that this time faces both towards and away from you\u2014will also be properly oriented! Rotate any other misaligned gear rings into position with R4. Look over the ball to see if there are any gear rings still out of alignment. If so:Point the gear ring toward you. Turn R4 upward if the gear ring divider looks like (\u201c/\u201d). Turn R4 downward if the gear ring looks like (\u201c\\\u201d). Keep repeating this until all the gear rings are properly aligned.
