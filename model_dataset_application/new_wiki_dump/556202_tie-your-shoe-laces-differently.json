          "description":"If you've noticed that your shoelaces seem to come untied frequently, try this knot, which is based off of the super-secure knot that doctors use to tie sutures after surgery (the knot is also popular with fishermen.) To start, make the same sort of basic \"right over left\" knot that you'd begin with when tying your shoes normally. To do this, simply take your right lace and cross it over the left lace. Wrap it around the left lace once and pull tight. You're done!"

          "headline":"Make a loop with one lace.",
          "description":"After this, make a small \"looped\" section by doubling one of the laces back on itself. You're not doing any tying or wrapping here \u2014 just re-positioning one string so that it makes a U shape."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Bring the free lace behind the loop and around the front.",
          "description":"Next, take the lace that you didn't make a loop with and pull it so it crosses behind the loop. Then, pull it back around in front of the loop. This should make a small \"hole\" between the two laces and the initial \"right over left\" knot at the bottom."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Make a second loop with the free lace and feed it through the \"hole.\"",
          "description":"Take the slack end of the free lace in your hand and make a second loop by doubling it up on itself in a U shape (just like you did with the other lace.) Push this second loop through the \"hole\" that was formed in the previous step. Resist the urge to pull the knot tight at this point \u2014 if you do, you'll just be left with an ordinary shoelace knot."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Wrap the new loop around the lace and back through the hole.",
          "description":"Now, take the second loop that you just pushed through the hole and wrap it all the way around the first loop. Push it back through the hole one again. \"Double-wrapping\" the loop this way is what makes the surgeon's knot so secure \u2014 the friction that's generated when the tightly-wrapped laces rub against each makes it very hard for this knot to come undone."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pull the loops to tighten.",
          "description":"Now, you can simply pull the loops in opposite directions to tighten the knot. The results will look a little like a standard shoelace knot, but should be much more secure. If you really don't want your laces to come undone, try soaking the knot in water before pulling it tight. As the water evaporates, the fabric of the laces will constrict, making the knot even tighter."

          "headline":"Undo the knot by pulling on the lace ends.",

To start, all you need to do is make a very basic starting knot (the same kind you'd start with when tying your shoes normally.) As a reminder, to make this basic knot, take your right lace and cross it over the left lace. Wrap it under the left lace once and pull tight.

          "description":"Next, take the right lace and double about an inch or two of the lace back on itself to make a \"loop\" or U-shaped section. Just like in a real noose, this loop will eventually become the \"neck hole.\" Once you make the loop, take the loop and the other lace in your hand and hold both so that they are pointing upward. This isn't essential, but it ensures that all of your laces are positioned correctly for the next step and keeps things a little tidier as you start to make the noose."

          "headline":"Coil the free lace around the loop.",
          "description":"Starting at about the middle point of the loop, start wrapping the free section of lace around both parts of the loop and the other lace. In other words, you should be wrapping the lace around a \"bundle\" of three laces : both sides of the loop and the free lace. Work your way down towards the bottom of the loop, coiling tightly as you go. There's no exact number of coils you need to make this way \u2014 longer laces will be able to make more coils than shorter ones, but as long as you are able to make about four or five, your knot should hold."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Feed the lace through the gap at the bottom.",
          "description":"When you've coiled the free lace all the way to the bottom of the loop, take whatever slack is left and pass it through the small hole between the initial \"right over left\" knot and the lace that you've been using to coil. This hole should be near the bottom of the coil you just made, but slightly off to the side. When you've done this, pull the lace gently to tighten. If your lace isn't long enough to reach the bottom of the loop, try starting over and making the initial loop smaller."

          "headline":"Undo the knot by pulling on the loop.",
          "description":"When you're ready to untie this mini noose knot, slip your finger into the loop and pull up. The \"loose\" side of the noose should pull through the coil easily and the entire knot should fall apart. On the other hand, pulling the \"tight\" side of the noose should cause the coil to tighten. You may want to give this side a tug after you put on your shoes to keep your knot tight during your daily activity."

However, this knot requires you to lace your shoes in a special way. This initial lacing is tricky, but not impossible with one hand. Start by tying the lace to one of the top eyelets \u2014 the little holes on either side of the tongue that the laces go through."

Next, re-lace the shoe in a zig-zagging pattern as follows:\nThread the lace through the eyelet at the top that's directly across from it. in other words, if you started at the top left eyelet, thread the lace into the top right one. Pull the lace under and through the eyelet directly beneath the previous one. It should go under the material between the two eyelets, not over it. Thread the lace through the eyelet directly across from it again. Continue this \"down, across, down, across\" pattern until you reach the last eyelet at the bottom.

Take one side of the loop that's laying across the lowest straight lace section and pull it under the straight lace and over the other side of the loop. This essentially creates a second loop that should be pointing up or down the tongue of the shoe. If you're working with one hand, the easiest way to do this is to grab the initial loop between your thumb and index finger, then use your index finger to push one side of the loop as you guide it under the straight lace and over the other side of the loop."

Continue pulling the loop down and across to slide it back towards the eyelet \u2014 when the knot is tight, it should be touching (or else lie very close to) the eyelet."
