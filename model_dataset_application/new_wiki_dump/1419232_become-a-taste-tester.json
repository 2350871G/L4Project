Being a consumer taste tester is not a full-time job, so you\u2019ll want to look for an opportunity close to where you already live. The best place to start is with a Google search for \"taste testers\" in your area. Consumer taste testers get paid approximately $15/hour or up, but sometimes are paid per test, instead of per hour. If you know of a specific organization in your area, start your search on their website. Some examples of where to look include the following:\nMcCormick & Company is located in Hunt Valley, Maryland. The Consumer Product Testing Centre via the Government of Alberta is located in Edmonton, Alberta. The National Food Lab is located in Livermore, California. The North Carolina State University Sensory Service Centre is located in Raleigh, North Carolina."

In order to ensure they can find the right testers for each opportunity, the organization may send you questionnaires asking very specific questions about food. Be sure to answer any questions that are asked honestly, as your answers will impact what tests you\u2019ll be asked to participate in. For example, some tests may require males who are 20 to 35 years old. The organization will query the database to find all testers who are male and who are between the ages of 20 and 35. They will then reach out to some of those testers to see who may be interested in participating."

Do not eat or smoke within the 30 minutes before your test. Do not wear fragrant items like perfume or cologne. Do not bring children with you. You will also be required to turn your cell phone off when in the test. Depending on the type of test, you may also be required not to speak to anyone else while at the test."
