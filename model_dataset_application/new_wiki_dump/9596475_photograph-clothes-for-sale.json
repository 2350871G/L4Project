You could purchase a standing, full-body dress mannequin, or you could also get a set of hollow-backed partial mannequin bodies. These also come in sets that include a male, female, and gender-neutral child mannequin. Clothes that work best with mannequins include jeans, blazers, long dresses, coats, and blazers.

A good model can also more clearly appeal to your target market. For example, if you\u2019re selling your clothes with teenagers in mind, having a teen model will draw in teens and help them imagine how it would look on them. You could also ask a friend to help you out with the modeling. To save money, use a mannequin or dummy for the basic side, front, back, and close-up detail shots, and use the model to show what the article of clothing looks like when it\u2019s paired with an outfit."

To add the illusion of depth to the clothes, use techniques such as tucking in fabric around the underarm area or adding tissue paper inside the clothes. The flat lay format works best with skirts, sweaters, shoes, scarves, handbags, towels, and kids wear. If you don\u2019t have the budget for a model or a mannequin, this technique is a simple, affordable alternative."

Make sure the poses you\u2019re using don\u2019t cover up too much of the product with accessories or hands. For example, if you\u2019re photographing a flowy dress, you could have the model hold out the sides of the dress to show off the fabric. If you\u2019re photographing a men\u2019s winter jacket, you could have the model turn slightly to the side and put his hands in the pockets.
