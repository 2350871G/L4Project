If you don't live near any sort of natural water, good luck holding a beach party. try to find a spot with lots of places to sit, such as logs, rocks, etc. Of there is none, bring camping chairs."

Try to keep it with just people that you trust, but be careful, as you can't control who goes to the beach."

      "description":"Beer is a very convenient drink for outside parties such as these, so I suggest you buy a lot. You could tell people to buy their own, but you should at least have some backups for you and your buddies. You can also drink other bottled/canned drinks, such as ciders, or pre-mixed, I definitely do not recommend hard bar, because it can be inconvenient to have a big bottle, if you want to shoot it, or mix it. If you simply have to, try using pop or water bottles to carry it in. Don't forget the food! !"

Build it in a place that is away from flammable objects, like trees, bushes, grass. Find a safe place for it. Ask somebody where you could put the fire if you don't know. Ask your fire department if there are any fire restrictions in your area, also."
