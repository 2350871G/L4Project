  "text":" Creating the Creases Obtain a crisp, crease-free bill. The more crisp the bill, the easier it will be to make clean folds. Make sure there aren\u2019t any existing creases, because you\u2019ll be creating new creases that will guide you throughout the folding of the turtle. If you can\u2019t find a crisp $1 bill, try looking for a $10 or $20 bill. Work on a flat surface like a desk or workbench so you can press hard on the folds. Fold the dollar bill in half, lengthwise. Fold the dollar bill in half, lining the top of the bill with the very bottom of the bill. The top and bottom edges should not overlap or be folded on an angle. If you unfolded the bill, there would be a line running horizontally through the middle of the bill. Fold the bill in half, from right to left. Fold it in half, so the left edge lines up with the right edge of the bill. Press down with your fingernail to flatten out the bill. The bill should now be exactly a quarter of the size that it was when you started. Unfold the bill and flatten it. This should reveal two creases forming a perpendicular cross in the middle of the bill. This also splits your bill into 4 equally sized quadrants. The cross should meet right in the middle of George Washington\u2019s cheek. Fold the bottom right hand corner on a 90 degree angle. The right hand side of the bill should align with the center crease. This also should leave George Washington\u2019s face half covered by the right side of your bill. Fold the bottom left hand corner to the center crease. This should form a point where you folded both sides and resemble an upside down pyramid. Make sure the flat end of the pyramid lines up, so you\u2019re getting a perfectly diagonal crease. Unfold then fold the top right and left corner of the bill to the center crease. Unfold the bill so it\u2019s flat, and repeat the steps, this time using the top corners of the bill. Take the top left hand corner of the bill and bring it down, creating a 90 degree angle. Repeat with the right hand corner. Fold the two Xs in half, vertically. At this point, you should have two X shapes formed by the creases you just made. Fold the X on both sides so that each one has a crease running down the middle. Take the left edge of your bill and fold it horizontally so it lines up with the center crease, to get a perfect vertical crease down the center of your X. This is the last crease that you need to make before you start folding your bill into a turtle. Unfold your bill. You should now see a cross in the middle of the bill, two creases on each side that form an X, and a vertical crease in each X. The middle of your bill should look like a diamond where the left and right X meet. Creating creases may seem unnecessary, but it makes it easier to fold your turtle. Folding the Shell Collapse the top and bottom of the X on the left hand. When you pinch the top and bottom of the X it should form a triangular flap on the left hand side. If you folded your creases accurately, it should be a perfect triangle and the bottom of the triangle should run in a straight line. If it doesn\u2019t look like a triangle, unfold it and try it again. Your edges should all line up, except for the edge near the center crease of the bill which should overlap the center crease by around a centimeter. Fold back the excess bill in the center of the turtle. Fold the excess flap that hangs over the center crease of your turtle, towards the left point of its shell. This will create a long rectangular fold on the left hand side of the middle crease. Repeat the same process on other side. Pinch the right hand X and repeat the steps so you have a triangle of exactly the same size on the right side of your bill. Fold back the excess flap on the right hand side. Your bill should now look like a diamond. If you folded your bill face up, you should see the pyramids in your right triangle and the bald eagle in your left triangle. Fold the tip of the triangle on the left and right sides towards the center. This will form the shell of the turtle. If you flip your bill over, it should look like a hexagon. You\u2019ve just completed your turtle\u2019s shell. On the top of the turtle\u2019s shell you  should see \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d Creating the Feet and Head Fold the inside center flaps on an angle towards the outside of the bill. This will form the turtle's feet. You will have four total center flaps to fold on a 60 - 90 degree angle. You can change the angle in which these flaps are folded, just keep in mind they will change the appearance of your turtle\u2019s feet. Flip the bill over to make sure it can stand. You should now have a hexagon shell and four feet from the folds you just made. If you\u2019ve done everything right, your turtle should be able to stand on the feet you folded. Fold the tip of hexagon down, towards the inside of the turtle and flip over. This will form the turtle\u2019s head. When you flip your turtle over and it will look like an upside down triangle at the top of your hexagon. The more you fold the top in, the larger you can make your turtle\u2019s head. Fold the triangle back up, a half centimeter below the previous fold. This will give the appearance of your turtle head coming out its shell. You can repeat the process with the bottom of your turtle to create a tail, but loosen the fold and make it smaller so it doesn\u2019t look like your turtle has two heads.",
