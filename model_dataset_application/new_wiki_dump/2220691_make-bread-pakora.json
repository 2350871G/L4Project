  "text":" Preparing the Potato Filling Peel the boiled potatoes.  Mash the potatoes when they are still warm.  Add the coriander leaves, green chili, red chili powder, amchur powder, salt to the mashed potatoes.  Mix well. Taste the seasonings and adjust accordingly. Keep aside. Preparing the Besan Batter In a bowl, take the besan (chickpea flour/gram flour).  Add the ajwain, red chili powder, garam masala powder, asafoetida and salt.  Add around \u00bd cup water and mix. The batter should not be very thick nor too thin. Check the seasonings and adjust accordingly. Add a few drops of oil to the batter and mix well.  Keep the ready batter aside.  Assembling and Frying the Bread Pakora Cut the bread into triangular slices. You are free to cut them in any shape of your choice. Take a teaspoon of the mint-coriander chutney and apply it evenly on the triangular slice of bread.  Take around 2 tbsp of the mashed potato mixture and apply it on the bread evenly.  Cover this potato stuffed slice with another slice. You have now a beautiful triangular stuffed bread sandwich. Just slightly press the sandwich. Dip the entire stuffed bread sandwich in the besan batter. Be sure to coat it evenly. Take care not to keep the stuffed bread sandwich a long time in the batter as the bread tends to break. Heat up some oil for frying and slide the besan batter coated bread sandwich in the oil.  Fry a medium flame until they are crisp and golden brown. Your break pakoras are ready! Drain on a tissue paper.  Serve hot with tomato sauce or with any chutney of your choice! ",
