Leafy herbs like basil or leafy greens like kale may do better in planters so they can be moved if need be. Keeping certain plants in pots can also help you grow plants in areas with a lot of tree roots, which commonly cause problems in shade gardens."

Put vegetables that need direct sunlight in the sunny spots and then plant vegetables and herbs that do well in partial to light shade in these spots in your garden. This way, your garden is organized based on what will grow best in sunlight and in the shade. Do not try to plant vegetables or herbs that require full sunlight in shady spots, as they will not grow well."
