  "text":" Make Pacifier Napkin Rings for a Baby Shower Fold a napkin into quarters.  Turn the napkin so that the square shape looks like a diamond. The loose corners should form the top 2 sides of the diamond, and the folded corners should form the bottom 2 sides. Fold the napkin left to right into accordion pleats, starting with the left-most point of the diamond. Your goal is to fold the napkin as though you were making a paper fan. Thread the top point of the folded napkin through the handle of a baby pacifier.  Pull the pacifier down until it reaches the midpoint of the folded napkin.  Fluff the napkin folds both above and below the pacifier. You want the napkin to be cinched in the middle with the pacifier with both ends fanned out decoratively. Repeat the fold and add the pacifier for the rest of the napkins in the table setting.  Make Fabric Napkin Rings for a Baby Shower Cut a paper towel roll into 6 or 7 circles that are approximately 1-1/2\u201d wide.  Trim fabric into 4\u201d-wide by 6\u201d-long pieces using either scissors or a rotary cutter. Choose a fabric that matches the colors of your shower or that matches colors that the parents have chosen for the baby\u2019s room. Wrap the length of 1 piece of fabric around 1 paper towel roll ring.  Using a hot glue gun, glue 1 end of the fabric to the paper towel roll.  Fold the other edge of the fabric under so that you have no visible raw edges.  Glue the folded edge to the fabric, making sure that you have pulled the fabric securely around the paper towel roll.  Tuck the top edge of the fabric into the paper towel ring.  Secure the fabric with hot glue.  Tuck the bottom edge of the fabric into the paper towel ring.  Glue it in place, making sure that none of the cardboard paper towel roll remains visible. The interior of the napkin holder does not have to look perfect since the napkin will be tucked inside anyway. Repeat the process with the remaining paper towel rolls and fabric.  Add additional decorations. If you know the baby\u2019s name, for instance, then you can create circular or oval \u201clogos\u201d featuring the baby\u2019s name by using graphics software. Print the logos on cardstock, cut them out and glue each one to the front of your napkin holder. Thread napkins through each holder. Unfold the napkins and place your forefinger beneath the center of the napkin. Use your other hand to pull the napkin through the middle of the ring. Half of the napkin should be above the ring, and half should be below the ring. Make Tissue Flower Napkin Rings for a Baby Shower Stack 4 pieces of tissue paper on top of each other.  Cut the paper into 10\u201d by 5\u201d pieces.  Fold each 4-layer rectangle accordion-style.

Place the center of the folded tissue paper over the midpoint of the strand of floral wire.  Pull the wire tightly around the tissue paper.  Twist the floral wire to hold the tissue paper in place.  Trim the ends of the tissue paper so that they are round like the edge of a semicircle.  Gently pull the 4 layers of tissue paper apart until you\u2019ve created a tissue paper flower.  Fold a napkin in half after you finish making the tissue paper flower. You will roll the napkin and then attach the flower to the napkin using the florist\u2019s wire. Turn the folded napkin so that the narrower edges are at the top and bottom and the longer edges are on the left and right.  Fold the bottom end of the napkin upward to create a small circular roll.  Continue rolling the napkin around itself tightly.  Place the flower on top of the rolled napkin at the midpoint of the roll.  Twist the floral wire around the napkin. This will keep the holder in place. Make Baby Shower Napkin Rings from Ribbon Fold a napkin in half.  Fold the napkin accordion-style along the narrow end, the same way that you would fold a paper fan.  Cut a piece of wired ribbon that is long enough both to go around the napkin and to make the decorative bow.  Place the folded napkin on top of the ribbon. The folded edge should be at the top, and the loose edges should be at the bottom. Draw the ends of your ribbon into two equally sized loops.  Cross the right loop over the left loop.  Push the right loop around, over and behind the left loop to create a round opening.  Pull the top of the right loop through the opening. Then, pull the knot tight around the napkin. Trim the ends of the ribbon with scissors. You can cut a V-shaped notch into the ends or you can simply trim the ends into a diagonal shape. Pull on the edges of the top part of the napkin to create a fan shape. The top of the napkin will be fanned over the ribbon, while the bottom portion is still folded together. Glue a favor to the knot at the center of the ribbon. You can use a large pastel safety pin or any other flat cutout of a baby item (a pacifier or a rattle, for instance).",
