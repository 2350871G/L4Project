Use a pack of frozen squid and not squid that was thawed overnight in a fridge enough to begin melting. Bacteria will multiply faster in squiddy water at 1\u00b0C than squiddy ice at 0\u00b0C. Run cold water over the squid to speed the thawing. The faster it thaws, the less time it has to pick up a smell before you start cutting it into rings, which is a sign that it might go bad after more time goes by. Take the squid body in one hand. Next, pull the head and tentacles out of it with the other. Remove the piece of cartilage from inside of the body. That can be thrown away. Hold the body with one hand. Use the other hand to pull away the flaps and remove the skin. Clean the squid by rinsing it under cold water. After the rinsing, absorb as much water as possible to get it as dry as possible. The drier the squid, the crispier it will be when it is fried. Cut the body into rings \u2153 to 1/2 inch (0.8 to 1.3 cm) thick. Leave the tentacles whole or cut them in half if they are too large. Place a large saucepan on the stove over medium heat.  Add enough vegetable oil to the saucepan so that it is three inches (7.6 cm) deep. Allow it to heat to 350 degrees F (176 C).
