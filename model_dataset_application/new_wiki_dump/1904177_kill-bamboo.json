          "description":"Before you spray new bamboo leaves, make sure that you either cut or mow it down and then allow it to regrow. It sounds weird, but you need to let new bamboo grow. Bamboo herbicide won't be effective if the canes of the bamboo are well-developed. Bamboo is stringy but not very hard. A \"lopper\", which looks like scissors with huge handles and a little jaw, cuts it much better than a saw. Cut the bamboo down in late winter so that you can be applying to herbicide on the new growth in late spring or early summer."

          "description":"Use a sharp spade (or another sharp garden implement) to cut down the bamboo and sever the rhizomes of the bamboo. Break up as many clumps of rhizomes as possible. Rhizomes are masses of roots that grow underground. These root-stalks grow horizontally underground in clumps and then send new shoots up beyond the surface when the plant is ready to grow. You probably recognize rhizomes if you've ever eaten ginger and galangal, or have seen raw turmeric. These roots with many offshoots are what the underground rhizomes of the bamboo plant should look like."

          "description":"Glyphosate herbicide only kills the plants that it comes into direct contact with. This means that you'll need to be careful about applying it only to the bamboo. Most glyphosate herbicides need to be sprayed onto the leaves, stalks, and shoots of the plant and allowed enough time to penetrate before any water dilutes it. Unless instructed to do so, do not apply glyphosate herbicide to the soil surrounding the bamboo, as it will be ineffective. To reduce the risk of killing the wrong plant or over-spraying, you can paint the herbicide onto leaves and stalks with a brush instead of spraying the plant. If you're near a water supply (river, lake, ocean, etc.) make sure that you're using an herbicide that's meant for eradicating plants near water. You don't want to contaminate nearby bodies of water."

          "description":"One application won't eradicate the infestation; bamboo is tough and tends to spread like wildfire. (Unfortunately, even wildfire can't completely get rid of this pest!) As the bamboo continues to send up shoots, you'll need to continually apply the herbicide treatment to the leaves, stalks, and shoots of the plant in order to properly exterminate it. When using any kind of herbicide, remember to consult instructions that come with packaging. Some herbicide instructions may differ significantly from the advice offered in this tutorial. When push comes to shove, defer to instructions that come with the herbicide product. You should also use this herbicide method in conjunction with rooting out the rhizomes of the bamboo so that it doesn't keep sending up shoots."

Like all the other methods and ways, this will take some paying attention to the bamboo and continuing to root out its different culms (bamboo stalks) and rhizomes (bamboo's underground stems). You will want to cut down the clumps, but you'll also want to root out the rhizomes, otherwise the beast will keep growing. Rhizomes grow in the top foot of soil, so you'll want to dig down until you find them. Sever the rhizomes as you go, especially if you want to keep some of the bamboo plant. This will keep it from sending out more shoots. Keep cutting it down and digging it out. You will need to do this until the bamboo plant stops sending up shoots. This can take months or even years to accomplish, but there isn't a faster way, because bamboo is so pervasive and resistant. If you want to eradicate bamboo on your property, you must remove all rhizomes."

This can help reduce the stalks, especially on a plant that hasn't grown too huge (you'll have less luck mowing bamboo stalks that have grown huge, unless you cut them down first). Mowing the bamboo frequently can reduce the rhizomes, because it takes away their way of collecting food (from the sun through their leaves). You will have to mow whenever you see stalks arising because this method can take a while."

          "description":"Another way you can get rid of your bamboo is to basically starve it. You should start by cutting down the stalks below the soil line and then placing a dark tarp or thick piece of plastic over the top of the area. This will make it so the plant is cut off from rain, sun and air which will eventually kill it. Anchor the tarp or plastic down. People tend to use cinder blocks, but anything heavy enough to keep the tarp down will work fine. You have to make sure that the plastic or tarp does not move because the point is to cut the bamboo off from the elements. If you get new growth coming up beyond the perimeter of the tarp, you'll need to immediately either spray it with herbicide (containing triclopyr) or cut it down and put a cinder block or another tarp over the area. Again, this can take a while, so you have to be patient. Leave the tarp there for at least a month or so (but it can take up to a year to really eradicate the bamboo)."
