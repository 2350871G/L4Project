          "description":"Dissolve the spices' capsaicin with the casein protein found in milk. If you\u2019re at home, fetch yourself a glass of milk pronto. If you're at a restaurant, flag the server down and order one right away. Or, if a yogurt dish has been served as a side to your meal, treat your mouth to a spoonful, since the dairy in that will work, too. Ice cream works even better, since the \u201cice\u201d provides some blissful relief, while the \u201ccream\u201d provides something more or less solid to suck on for a while before it melts."

          "headline":"Have a shot of alcohol.",
          "description":"Pour yourself an ounce of hard liquor. Knock your shot back without swallowing. Swish the liquid around in your mouth. Unless the liquor has been chilled beforehand, the heat-on-heat sensation may feel unpleasant at first, but rest assured that the alcohol is dissolving the capsaicin and ridding your nerves of the agitating agent. Use hard liquor rather than beer or wine. The alcohol itself is needed to actually get rid of the capsaicin, so pour yourself something with a high content. Most liquors average around 40% alcohol content, while beer is typically less than 10% with wine only reaching 20% at its highest. If you\u2019re not a drinker, don\u2019t worry. Go ahead and spit the liquor out once you\u2019re done rinsing your mouth with it. There is no need to swallow."

          "description":"If you\u2019re at home, fetch the sugar bowl. If you\u2019re at a restaurant, rip open a packet. Soak up the spice with the granules by either dumping the sugar right into your mouth, or by mixing a tablespoon with 8 ounces of water for sweet relief. Honey works just as well."

          "headline":"Eat chocolate.",
          "description":"Suck on milk chocolate if you have it, since this will contain casein, the protein in milk that dissolves capsaicin. If all you have is dark chocolate with no dairy content, fall back on that. It will be less effective, but the fat content will absorb some of the spice."

          "headline":"Use bread as a sponge.",
          "description":"Grab a roll from the bread bowl or a couple slices from your bread box. It won\u2019t break the capsaicin down, so don\u2019t keep it in your mouth for too long. Chew it up as you\u2019d normally eat a hunk of bread. Let it absorb the spice in your mouth, then swallow or spit it out. If you have olive oil on hand, dip the bread in that, since olive oil will dissolve the capsaicin. Peanut butter will as well, so you can also try making a sandwich. Other starchy foods, like french fries, may also do the trick. Just be sure they\u2019re not spicy, too!"

Keep it there for as long as the ice lasts, or until the burning sensation has faded away for good. If all you have is cold water and no ice, by all means, use that instead.

If the burn is elsewhere inside your mouth, breathe through your mouth to help it dry the best you can. Then rinse your mouth out. Use a mint toothpaste that\u2019s free of fluoride. Other products with mint (gum, chocolate, breath mints) will also provide a cooling effect."

Draw breath over your tongue and exhale the same way to soothe the burn with the air current. If you\u2019ve burned underneath your tongue, touch the the tip of your tongue to your upper lip as you breathe. This way your inhales have a better chance of drawing air over the affected the area."

The effected area will probably look a little red even if it's only a minor burn, but if there appears to be any more damage beyond that, see your doctor in case it turns out to be a third-degree burn. Do not use any sort of topical treatment beyond ice cubes or water until your doctor okays it. If it's only a minor burn, it should heal after a few days as long as you don't aggravate it.

Allow hot food and beverages to cool off significantly before eating so your damaged nerve endings aren\u2019t damaged any further. Better yet, avoid warm/hot foods altogether.
