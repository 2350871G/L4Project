If the piece of plastic can\u2019t hold liquid, pour rubbing alcohol into another container and put the piece of plastic inside. Rinse the piece of plastic with soap and water after pouring out the rubbing alcohol. If you don\u2019t have rubbing alcohol, you can also use hand sanitizer the same way."

Rinse the plastic with soap and water after you pour the bleach out. Test the bleach out on a small section of the plastic before covering it entirely to make sure it doesn\u2019t harm the plastic in any way."

Mix 1 part white vinegar with 1 part water before pouring the mixture into or onto your plastic. Let the plastic sit with the white vinegar for a couple of hours before rinsing it clean with soap and water. If you\u2019re trying to remove stains from a piece of plastic that can\u2019t hold liquids, pour the white vinegar mixture into a container and then set the piece of plastic inside. The vinegar smell will disappear once the plastic is washed and left to dry."

Stick the plastic in the bag of hydrogen peroxide and lay it out in direct sunlight. Wait 3-4 hours before rinsing it off with clean water. You can purchase hydrogen peroxide at a drugstore or big box store. If you\u2019re treating some sort of plastic mechanism, make sure you remove all the parts that aren\u2019t plastic before putting it into the hydrogen peroxide. You can also use an old toothbrush to scrub the hydrogen peroxide onto the plastic, if desired."
