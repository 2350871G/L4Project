However, a cluttered refrigerator creates a disorganized, messy look. Your kitchen will look more stylish if your refrigerator is free of decorations, so clean everything off of the doors and sides of your appliance. If your refrigerator is dusty or sticky, wash it with a dish detergent that has a grease-fighter."

          "description":"Keeping your appliances, cooking utensils, and frequently used kitchen items on your countertop may be convenient, but it also makes your kitchen look messy. An empty countertop looks more expensive than a cluttered counter, so don\u2019t leave these items out. Put all of your small appliances and other cooking gear in your cabinets or kitchen drawers so they\u2019re out of sight. Designate an easy-to-access cabinet for appliances you use often, like your toaster and coffee maker. If you have a jar for your cooking utensils, place the entire jar in your cabinet so you can easily bring it out while you\u2019re cooking. When you're finished cooking, put the jar back in the cabinet."

Choose the largest piece of art that will fit in the space you have for the maximum effect. Stick to a monochromatic color scheme for abstract pieces because they look more stylish. Alternatively, get a fine art painting or print. For an affordable option, look for sales on canvas art at a craft store or big box store. You could also paint your own abstract art. If you can\u2019t afford a large piece of art, create a small gallery wall by hanging 3-5 pieces of art together on the same wall."

The flowers will make your home look high-end without you having to spend much money. Pick flowers that fit your style or the season. You might get wildflowers during the summer, poinsettias during winter, or pink roses during spring.Variation: You might also incorporate a potted plant into your kitchen space. For instance, a succulent, orchid, or ivy would look lovely on your countertop or window sill."

If you like, incorporate 1 other color to add a personal touch. For instance, you might keep most of your kitchen white and gray but use mint colored hand towels or incorporate color in your wall art. If you have dark wood cabinets, you might paint your kitchen tan. Your rug and towels might be a mixture of brown and beige with a hint of a color, such as sky blue."

Choose a rug that\u2019s a solid color or has an abstract print so it won\u2019t make your kitchen decor look too busy. Lay your rug in front of your sink, in the center of the kitchen floor, or between your cabinets and your kitchen island, if you have one. For instance, you might lay a yellow and white striped rug in front of your sink or a large grey rug in the center of your kitchen.
