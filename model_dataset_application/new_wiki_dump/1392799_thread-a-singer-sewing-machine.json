  "text":" Raising the Needle and Presser Foot Turn off the sewing machine. Locate the power switch on the side of your sewing machine, and switch it to the off position. Do this before you try to thread your sewing machine. You will be inserting the thread through moving parts of the sewing machine. If the machine remains on and you accidentally apply pressure while trying to thread the machine, you could seriously injure your fingers. Raise the needle using the hand wheel on the side of the machine. Since the power is switched off, you will need to adjust the moving parts manually.

If you keep turning the wheel, the needle will move back down again, so make sure to stop turning when it reaches its highest point. Lift the presser foot with the lever. Locate the lever next to the needle base on your machine. Push this lever upwards to raise the presser foot. Having the presser foot in this position will make it easier to thread the machine because it will be out of the way. Threading the Top of the Machine Wind the bobbin before you thread the top part of your machine. If you don\u2019t have a pre-wound bobbin already, wind a bobbin now. Place a spool of thread onto the spool pin and move the bobbin winder pin to the far left. Insert the end of the thread through the hole in the rim of the bobbin and place the bobbin onto the winder pin. Push the bobbin pin back to the right.

It does not matter what direction the thread is going when you place it onto the spool pin. Wrap thread around the first thread guide. The first thread guide will be on the top of the machine above the needle apparatus. If you have the manual to your machine, look at the chart that indicates the function of each of the parts to locate this guide. Grasp the end of the thread on the spool and pull it across the top of the sewing machine to the first thread guide. Bring the thread through the slot under the thread guide. Wrap the end over the top of the thread guide and then wrap it around to the right side of the guide. As long as the thread is going through the guide and out on the right side, it should be fine. Insert the end of the thread under and over the second guide. The second thread guide will be next to the first thread guide. Use your instruction manual to locate it if possible. Go into the guide from the right underside of it. Then, bring the end of the thread over the top of the guide. After you do this, grasp the thread on either side of the thread guide and move the thread to the end of the guide. Make sure the thread is completely through the guide. Bring the thread through the threading canal and tension mechanism. Next, pull the end of the thread and wrap it around the tension mechanism, which is directly at the bottom of the threading canal. The threading canal is a grooved area on the side of your sewing machine. Bring the thread through the canal and around the bottom of the canal to go through the tension mechanism. Make sure that the thread is straight and taut in the threading canal. Pull the thread up through the other side of the threading canal. When you have the thread through the tension mechanism, bring it back up on the other side of the threading canal. Then, bring the thread over the take up lever at the top of the canal. The take-up lever also helps to control the tension on your machine. Pull the thread down and through the thread guide above the needle. Next, bring the end of the thread back down through the last part of the threading canal. When you get to the bottom of the canal, insert the thread through the thread guide that is located above the needle. This guide should be right where the blunt end of the needle is attached to your sewing machine. Thread the needle going from the front to the back of the machine. Keep pulling the thread down towards the eye of the needle. Then, insert the end of the thread through the eye of the needle and pull the end through by about 6 inches (15 cm) past the eye of the needle. If the end of the thread is frayed, cut about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the end. This should make it easier to thread the needle. You can also stiffen the end of the thread using water, saliva, or beeswax to make it easier to thread your needle. Loading the Bobbin Rotate the hand wheel clockwise to raise the needle to its highest position. The needle needs to be up and out of the way to load the bobbin case, so turn the wheel until it is at its highest position. This should only take about a half a turn. If you already raised the needle to thread the top portion of the machine, leave the needle where it is at. Open the bobbin case on the bottom of the machine. The bobbin case is located directly beneath the needle on your sewing machine. Look for a button or tab on the bobbin case. Press the button or lift the tab to open the case. The case should be empty, but if there is an empty bobbin inside you can remove it. If you do not have a front loading bobbin machine, there will be a case that you will have to remove and open. Place the bobbin into the case using the arrows. There should be arrows around the outside of the case. Use these arrows to determine which way the thread should be going.
