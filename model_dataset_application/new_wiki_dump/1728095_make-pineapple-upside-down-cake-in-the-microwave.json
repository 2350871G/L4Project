  "text":" Preparing the Dish Base Assemble all of the ingredients and needed materials before starting. This makes it easier to work quickly and efficiently. Put the brown sugar and margarine in an 8 inch (20.3 cm) glass cake dish--round is the best.  Microwave the brown sugar and margarine for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the margarine is melted.  Mix the melted brown sugar and margarine together. Spread evenly across the bottom of the cake dish. Arrange the pineapple slices and cherry halves, then the cut side of the cherry halves on top of the brown sugar and margarine mix. Have the cut side of the cherries facing up. Making the Batter Mix the 1/3 cup of pineapple juice and the water in a liquid measuring cup. Pour in enough water over the juice until it reaches 1/2 cup. Pour the yellow/vanilla cake mix into a mixing bowl. Add the 1/2 cup mixture of pineapple juice and water. Crack the egg, and pour the egg into the batter.  Stir until smooth.  Pour the cake batter you have just created on top of the brown sugar, margarine, pineapple, and cherry halves.  Microwaving the Cake Place into the microwave oven. Make sure that the cake dish is elevated by taking a microwavable plate, and turning it upside down, and placing the cake dish on top of this. Microwave for 7 minutes. Let sit in the microwave. Allow a standing time of one minute (with the microwave off). Remove from the microwave oven. Turn the cake onto a plate, upside down. You should see that what was on the bottom is on the top now, with the pineapple slices and cherries the main feature of the cake. Allow one more minute of standing time on the plate.  Serve and enjoy! ",
