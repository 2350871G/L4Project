  "text":" Pitting Cherries Wash your cherries in running water. Remove all dirt from the surface. You don\u2019t want dirt to mix in with the cherries after they are pitted. Most people use sour cherries for cherry jam, because they are easy to sweeten, while remaining slightly tart. If you use sweet cherries, reduce the amount of sugar you use. Purchase a cherry pitter if you have access to a cherry tree or you want to make a lot of cherry jam. It saves valuable time in the kitchen. Place a small bowl near the cutting board for the pits. Grab a large bowl for the cherries. Pick off the stem of the cherry. Then, insert the cherry into the small bowl of the cherry pitter. Hold the cherry pitter over the small bowl and squeeze the pitter to expel the pit. Use a chef\u2019s knife to pit cherries on a cutting board. Place a cherry on the board. Smash it with the side of the knife, like you would a clove of garlic. Remove the pit from the broken cherry. Use a paring knife to cut the pit out of the cherry. This will take longer than the smashing method and it is recommended when you want to keep the cherries looking presentable in a salad or dessert. Insert a partially unfolded paper clip into the top of the cherry and dig the pit out. Ensure you have at least four cups of cherries after they have been pitted.  Preparing Cherry Jam Chop the cherries or grind them in a food mill. The more you chop them, the easier the jam will be to spread. Pour four cups of cherries into a large metal stockpot or metal Dutch oven. Put it on a burner and turn it to high heat. Shake your package of powdered fruit pectin into the pot. These standard packages are available at kitchen/canning shops or online. Stir well to combine. Add the lemon juice. Lemon juice contains extra pectin and adds flavor. Also, add one-fourth cup (59ml) of rum or alcohol of your choice if you want a little extra flavor. Stir the mixture. Bring it to a full boil. Turn it to medium heat. Stir in your sugar. Traditional cherry jam is sweet, so five cups of granulated sugar is added for four cups of cherries. However, you can add as little as three cups of sugar for a tarter, healthier jam. Return the mixture to a boil. Let it boil for one minute. Remove it from heat. Canning Jam Set your boiling water canner on the stove. Fill it half full. Bring it to a boil while you pit your cherries. Sterilize your jars by inserting them into the rack and boiling them for 10 minutes. Reduce your heat to a simmer and leave them in the water. You want to pour hot cherry jam into hot jars to avoid cracking. You will need at least six half-pint jars or 12 four oz. jars. Boil a kettle full of water. Wash your jar lids and rims with soap and water. Pour boiling water over them to sterilize them. Remove the hot jars from the water bath. Set them upside down to remove water from the inside until you use them. Put on your oven mitts. Ladle the hot cherry jam into the hot jars. Leave one-fourth inch (0.6cm) headspace. Wipe the rims of the jars with a sterile cloth or damp paper towel. Place the lids on the top. Screw on the rims tightly. Insert your jars into the boiling water canner using your rack. Boil them according to your elevation. At an altitude of 1,000 feet (305m) or less, they require five minutes. At an altitude of 1,001 to 6,000 feet (306 to 1829m), they need 10 minutes.
