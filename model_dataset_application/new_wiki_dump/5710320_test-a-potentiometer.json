The actual reading may not be exactly what the potentiometer is rated for. These devices typically have a tolerance of 5-10%. Tolerance may be listed on the device but not always. The reading you get should not be outside of that range (e.g. a 10,000 ohm device rated 5% should read between 9500-10500 ohms)."

At the other end the value should be the maximum resistance of the potentiometer. The resistance should gradually and slowly increase as you turn the controller and there should be no sudden jumps."
