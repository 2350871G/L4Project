The squirrel walks in, drawn by the alluring smell of bait, and trips the lever to shut the door of the cage. This way, you can take the animal alive, without having to kill it or dispose of the remains. Mount this trap on the hole through which the squirrels are entering and exiting. Make sure that the cage is large enough to hold a squirrel. In general, it should be at least 16 inches long, five inches wide, and five inches high. Consider the ethical as well as the practical benefits of using a live trap. Not only do you avoid a messy cleanup, but you avoid killing an unwitting creature."

The idea of the one-way trap is that the squirrel can get into the hole, but not out of it. You should be able to find the entrance by looking for light or feeling for an airflow. Check vents in the walls and \"valleys\" in your roof. The holes may be smaller than you expect. If you just want to keep the squirrel out of your attic, you can set up a one-way door trap leading outside. This way, the squirrel will be able to get out, but it won't be able to get back in. Be aware, however, that mother squirrels often hide out in attics when they are raising their young \u2013 so you might wind up with a bunch of dead baby squirrels unless you are able to root them out."

Check the trap from afar, if possible. If the trap is outside, look out your window instead of coming close. However, if the trap is in your attic or another indoor space, you might not be able to avoid creating a disturbance. Don't take the trap for granted.
