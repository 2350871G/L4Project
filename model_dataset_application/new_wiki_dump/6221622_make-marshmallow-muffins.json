  "text":" Preparing the Muffin Mixture Sieve the self-raising flour into a medium bowl. Keep the sieve high above the bowl (but not too high) so air can get into the flour. The more air in your flour, the lighter the muffins will be. Dense muffins do not taste very nice. Add the softened butter or margarine to the bowl.  Rub the butter with your fingers into the flour until it forms bread crumb like mixture.  Make a well in the middle of the mixture and add the sugar, eggs, mashed bananas, milk and toffee sauce.  Mix all the ingredients together until well combined. The mixture should now be looking like cake mixture or batter. Avoid mixing the mixture for too long as it will become denser every time you work with it. Set the muffin mixture aside and move on to the marshmallows.  Preparing the Marshmallows Open the packet of marshmallows and toast them. You can choose to toast them over the stove top fire or using a frying pan (skillet). Using the frying pan is recommended, however, you must be very quick over a very high heat because the marshmallows will melt instead of getting toasted. Dip each toasted marshmallow in warm chocolate sauce.  Leave the marshmallows on a plate in the fridge to set. The chocolate coated marshmallows may take as little as 20 minutes to as long as 4 hours depending on your fridge or the amount of chocolate you coated over the marshmallows. Cooking the Muffins Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0C (320\u00b0F).  Distribute the cake mixture evenly in the muffin tins on the muffin tray.  Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.  Place one chocolate marshmallow on the top centre of each muffin about 5 minutes before they are ready.  Return the muffins back to the oven and allow them to finish off.  Take the muffin tins out of the oven. Use a tea towel or oven mitt to take out the tray to ensure that you don't get burnt. The muffin tray will be very hot. Take out the muffins from the tins and allow them to cool in the tins.  Place on a cooling rack and allow them to cool until they can be handled. You may want to skip this step if you prefer to have your muffins very hot. Serve with custard, cream, white chocolate topping or ice-cream. ",
