However, you may have the highest chance of success if you start near the end of the plant's dormant period, or at the start of the growing season. In most cases, this means early spring, but a few succulent species begin growing in autumn or winter. If you already have a succulent cutting, skip to the next section, on planting the cutting. Even if you did not follow the steps below to remove the cutting, most succulents still have a relatively high chance of propagating."

Reduce the risk of infection by heating the knife blade in an open flame, or by wiping the blade with rubbing alcohol. Using pruning shears or hand-plucking methods are not recommended, as they may cause crushed or jagged tears that the leaf cannot properly heal from. If you do try to pluck the leaf, make sure the entire leaf snaps off the stem, and use a gentle tug, not excessive force."

Refer to the steps below for more information. If you do not know what genus or species your succulent plant is, try either method. The mother plant is unlikely to suffer if you follow the instructions below, making this a low-cost experiment. For a few unusual genera, but notably with aloe plants, the plant is best propagated by removing a newly grown \"pup\"."

For succulents that mostly grow outward, rather than upward, cut the leaves from the outer edge. Cut leaves where they connect to the stem, making a straight cut. Unless you are also taking a stem cutting, skip ahead to the section on planting your cutting. See the Tips section if you have a succulent with very large leaves."

Stem cuttings can be planted after one or two days of drying. Leaf cuttings undergo a more visible change, growing a \"callous\" over the cut surface. This can take anywhere from two to seven days. If a leaf shrivels significantly during this time, you may need to plant it early. This has a lower success rate, but the leaf may die if it dries out completely.

Maggie Moran\t\t\tHorticulturist\t\t\t\tIf you\u2019re propagating a leaf cutting, a little succulent or cactus mix can help. According to Maggie Moran, a horticulturalist, \u201cTo propagate a succulent from leaves, you lay the leaves flat on dry cactus mix and keep them in bright but indirect light. Once the cut edges are calloused over, spray the edges lightly once a week. After a week or two, roots will be seen on the eyes of the leaf.\u201d"
