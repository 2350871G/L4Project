Use a ruler or measuring tape to measure from here to the tip of the screw. Different screw heads rest differently when they are screwed into something, so you need to measure them differently. For example, a countersunk screw with a flat head will rest flush with whatever it is embedded into, so start the measurement at the top of the screw head. For a countersunk screw with a rounded head, also called an oval countersunk, you start the measurement where the oval top and the countersunk half meet in the middle. In other words, where the oval top would rest on the surface. To get the length of round-headed screws that aren\u2019t countersunk, start measuring from the flat underside of the screw head."

This diameter for screws in the imperial system is represented by either a gauge number or in fractions of an inch. A gauge number for screws in the imperial system corresponds to a certain fraction of an inch in diameter. To figure out the gauge number for a certain diameter, or vice versa, you have to look at a gauge guide to match up the \"#\" of the gauge with a fraction of an inch. You can find these guides online. For example, a #0 gauge screw is 1/16 of an inch in diameter,  #1 is 5/64 of an inch, a #2 is 3/32 of an inch, and so on."

They don\u2019t usually list the threads per inch. For example, 10 x 2\u201d means that the screw is a #10 gauge and is 2 inches long. If they include the thread count, it comes between the two numbers, like 10-35 x 2\u201d. Thread counts in the imperial system generally range from 35-40 threads per inch."
