          "description":"Hardwood floors are great, but they scratch easily and can be hard to maintain. If you like the look but don\u2019t want the hassle, choose ceramic wood\u2014it\u2019s really durable and is resistant to both moisture and scratching, which means your floors will look nice for a really long time. You can buy ceramic wood that imitates the look of almost any kind of species of tree. Keep in mind that real wood floors have a softer, warmer feel than ceramic wood, which can feel hard and cold. However, ceramic wood floors are easier to clean than real wood floors."

          "headline":"Choose ceramic or porcelain tile for a hardy, dense flooring option.",
          "description":"Ceramic and porcelain are very similar, but porcelain is just a little denser and a little less porous than ceramic. If you have kids, this might be a good option as it can withstand a bit more action (and it\u2019s less likely to stain). Porcelain does usually cost a little bit more than ceramic does, but it also usually lasts a little bit longer. Porcelain tiles come in lots of different patterns and colors, so you will have lots of options!"

          "headline":"Pick cork for a soft, quiet, moisture-resistant tile.",
          "description":"Cork is great if you\u2019re looking for an option that\u2019ll be a little softer and warmer on your feet. Cork is also a natural insulator so it could help you save money on your heating during the cold months. It\u2019s also a great option if you want to have bold walls and furniture, as the neutral coloring won\u2019t distract from any other design elements you want to implement. Cork is less expensive than most other types of tile, and it\u2019s environmentally friendly. You can get cork in its natural color, or choose another color option if you prefer. Cork is softer than other kinds of floors, so it is a great option for kids. Dropped dishes and toys will be less likely to break if they fall on a cork floor."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Opt for bamboo floors for a sustainable and soft tile.",
          "description":"They\u2019re easy to clean and water-resistant. However, they\u2019re not great for humid climates (constant water in the atmosphere could warp the bamboo and potentially cause it to grow mold), and they scratch more easily than other types of tile. If you have little kids or pets, this might not be the best flooring option for you. Bamboo only takes 3 to 5 years to mature, whereas trees can take 20 years or more to mature, meaning that bamboo is more renewable and better for the environment. Opt for bamboo if you are going for a minimalist look in your home."

          "headline":"Install mosaic tile for a patterned, textured flooring option.",
          "description":"Mosaic might seem odd for a living room, but it can really add a lot of color, texture, and art to your living space. It\u2019s great if you want the rest of the room to be simple but still want a burst of color or design in the room. Mosaic is great if you are interested in creating a design yourself, and it lasts a long time and is easy to clean. Mosaic is more expensive than most other tile options, and it can be really hard to install yourself. Most likely, you\u2019ll have to hire someone to put it in for you. Also, keep in mind that mosaic can be difficult to repair if a tile breaks or grout needs to be replaced, so it is best for low-traffic areas of your home."

          "headline":"Use slate for a slip-resistant, modern-looking style.",
          "description":"Slate is great for high-traffic areas, and all it needs to be cleaned is plain water and a mop. You can choose different colors of slate, like gray-blue, green, brown, and even burnt orange. Slate doesn\u2019t retain heat very well, though, so you might want to consider getting a rug to use in your living room, too. Slate will cost more than most other tiles will, but it will also outlast materials like ceramic and porcelain."

          "headline":"Select marble for an elegant, polished-looking tile for your living room.",
          "description":"Marble is really durable and can withstand a lot of traffic. You can also find marble in almost any color you\u2019d like, which makes it a great custom choice. Marble is more absorbent than a lot of other tiles, so there is a chance that it could get stained over time. Marble generally costs about $5 more per square foot than other types of tile. Marble can be very slippery because of how smooth it is, so it may increase the risk of people falling in your home. This is not a good option for homes with children or elderly, and you may still need to cover it with a rug to reduce the risk of slipping on it."

          "headline":"Get terracotta tiles for a rustic, red-clay floor.",
          "description":"Terracotta provides a really specific look that resembles the color of fired clay, so the tile ends up looking like a mix of burnt orange and red hues. It\u2019s a long-lasting material, but you do have to put a seal on it, otherwise, it is really absorbent and stains easily. Terracotta is a budget-friendly option, costing just $3 to $7 per square foot. This is a great option if your live in a hot or humid climate since terracotta will keep heat in during cooler times of the year."

          "description":"Terrazzo is made up of chips from different materials, like marble, quartz, granite, and glass. Those materials are ground up and mixed together, and then they\u2019re polished to give the terrazzo its shiny finish. The biggest concern with terrazzo is that it can be extremely slippery so it might not be the best option if you have kids or elderly family members living at home. Terrazzo is also really expensive, sometimes costing as much as $40 per square foot."

Ultimately, you want your tiles to be a color you won\u2019t mind looking at every day. Bring home samples of different colors and styles to see what looks best in your living room before making a final decision."

          "description":"Dark tiles absorb light, thus making a room look smaller. If you choose to use dark tiles, like black, dark gray, forest green, or brown, choose lighter and brighter colors for the furniture, walls, and curtains so that the room doesn\u2019t become claustrophobic. Light furniture and bright curtains would look great with a dark floor. Keep in mind that dark colors hide stains and dirt easier, but chips will be more noticeable."

Buy tiles that come with patterns on them, like flowers or geometric shapes, or alternate black and white tiles to create a checkerboard. Don\u2019t be afraid to think outside the box and use bright colors, like red, yellow, green, or even pink to personalize your living room. Think of your floor as a canvas. You can design it however you\u2019d like! Combine dark and light tiles for contrast, or go with a pattern that you like."

          "headline":"Use large tiles to make your living room appear more spacious.",
          "description":"The bigger the tiles, the bigger your room will appear. Look for tiles that are 13 by 13 inches (33 by 33 cm) or larger. There will be fewer grout lines in your living room, which will make the space look more streamlined. Larger tiles also mean less grout that you\u2019ll inevitably have to clean. Larger tiles also look more modern than small tiles. However, keep in mind that small tiles are more slip-resistant than large tiles."

Consider making a herringbone pattern, or use mosaic tiles to create a design on the floor. Browse magazine and websites for some decoration inspiration. There are lots of fun ways to arrange tiles apart from the classic methods you see most often."

You won\u2019t have to worry about cutting multiple tiles to fit at an angle, and the floor will look very neat and organized. A plain floor gives you a lot of creative space to decorate with art and furniture in the living room."

          "description":"If you don\u2019t want your floor to necessarily draw a lot of attention, opt for grout that matches the tiles you choose. The similar colors will make the tiles look like they are flowing together, which in turn will make the living room look seamless. An off-white or gray grout will tie light tiles together, drawing less attention down to the ground. Choose grout that matches the tile color for a seamless look."

          "description":"A grout that is a contrasting color to your tile will pop and stand out quickly. It\u2019s a great way to make a floor look stylized. Choose this option if you want your floor to be more of a focal point in the living room. A dark grout with light tiles will give your tiles more contrast and create more of a pattern. Likewise, dark tile with light grout will achieve the same contrast."

For example, if your living room is 15 by 20 feet (4.6 by 6.1 m), you\u2019ll need enough tile for 300  square feet (27.87 square meters).

It\u2019ll still be hard to tell exactly how things will look together, but having the photos should help you trim down your options. If you have fabric or paint swatches from when you painted or bought new furniture, take them along with you, too.
