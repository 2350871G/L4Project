Before adjusting the desk, make sure that all computer cables have been unplugged and there are no loose items on the desktop."

Position the primary monitor directly in front of you, and the second screen (if applicable) to the side where you use your mouse. Adjust the height of your monitors to just below eye level. If possible, move the monitor so that it is approximately 1 arm length away from where you will stand."

Purchase an adjustable keyboard platform and an adjustable monitor arm and attach them to the standing desk. These will enable you to adjust the height of your keyboard and monitor to a more comfortable position. Adjust your monitor arm to eye level or slightly below. If you notice yourself craning your neck while working try raising the arm slightly. Adjust the keyboard platform so that your arms form a 90\u00b0 angle. When you lower the desk to sit down ensure that you re-adjust the keyboard platform to a comfortable height."

Over time your body will get used to standing for long stretches, but initially you will need to sit down regularly to rest your legs. Keep a comfortable upright chair beside your desk so that you can easily lower your desk and sit down during the day. Avoid having the chair directly behind you so you don\u2019t trip over when walking around."

Everyone's feet are different so experiment with what works best for you. Avoid wearing high heel shoes and flat shoes with no padding. Running shoes or thick soled business shoes are good options as they offer arch support. If your workplace allows it, try working barefoot. Some people find this option puts less strain on their feet."

Keep your shoulders back, neck straight and head up. Avoid leaning on the desk as this causes your back and neck to curve."

These stools place your body in a perching position where your body is at a 120\u00b0 angle. The increased angle, compared to a chair, improves your circulation and helps to take pressure off your feet. If the stool has wheels, make sure these are locked before leaning on the stool. Use the stool by resting your weight on the seat and keeping both feet on the floor."

If you find that your wrists get tired throughout the day try lowering your desk slightly to a more comfortable position. Consider purchasing a wrist rest to help support your wrists, especially if you have had previous wrist strains."

          "headline":"Alternate between sitting and standing.",

When first using a standing desk it is recommended to stand for no longer than an hour total per day. As you feel your body get less fatigued, slowly increase your standing time up to 4 hours per day.. Creating a sitting-standing schedule can help you monitor your daily standing time."

          "description":"Regular stretching is an easy way to increase your energy and lessen the stiffness in your body. When you stretch, try to exercise each of the muscle groups in your legs. Stretch your hamstrings by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and legs straight. Gently bend down towards your feet until you feel a stretch in the back of your legs. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds. Stretch your calf muscles throughout the day by standing on your toes for 5 seconds at a time. Hold onto the desk to help keep your balance."

          "description":"Changing your stance will help keep you alert and increase your circulation. Experiment with different stances that feel comfortable. Remember to maintain correct posture. Try starting with your feet together and every few minutes slightly increase the distance between them until they are just past shoulder width. If you find your feet aching, try using a footstool to give your feet a break. Place a footstool in front of you. If you don\u2019t have a footstool try using a box or thick book. Rest one foot on the footstool and lean on the other, after a few minutes switch your feet over."
