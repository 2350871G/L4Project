The skin shouldn\u2019t have any tears or scars, and the netting on its surface should be thick, coarse, and strongly defined. If the cantaloupe\u2019s base color still has a greenish tint, that usually means that it isn\u2019t ripe yet.

To determine whether it is a good weight, you may have to test several cantaloupes from the store\u2019s display. That will help you determine if one in particular feels heavy enough."

If the melon has a sweet, musky scent, it\u2019s likely ripe and a good one to bring home. Smell the cantaloupe at the blossom end to test for ripeness. That\u2019s the end of the melon that\u2019s opposite the stem area. If the cantaloupe smells perfume, that may be an indication that it\u2019s overripe."

There should also be a slight indentation in the stem area to show that the cantaloupe separated easily from the vine when it was harvested. The stem itself shouldn\u2019t be attached to the cantaloupe. That usually indicates that the melon hasn\u2019t matured. Avoid any cantaloupes that are soft or moist in the stem area."

The deeper the color of a watermelon\u2019s field spot is the sweeter the melon will be. A white spot is fine, but a yellow spot is best."

The knocking test shouldn\u2019t be used as the only test for ripeness because not all watermelon farmers agree that it is accurate. Overripe watermelons can sometimes make the same sound as ripe fruit. Use it to confirm that a melon that meets all of the other criteria is ready to bring home. If the watermelon makes a thudding sound when you hit it, it is likely still full of water and not yet ripe."
