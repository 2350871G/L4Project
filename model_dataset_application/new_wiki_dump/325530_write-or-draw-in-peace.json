If you need inspiration or if your home is not a peaceful place for drawing, it could be away from home. Try the library or, if the weather is nice, the park."

      "description":"A permanent space might be a desk or nook or studio. A temporary place might be wherever you end up with a portable easel or notebook. Choose what is peaceful for you as far as environment goes. Do certain colors feel peaceful or comfortable to you? Decide whether you like your environment neat and tidy for creativity or a bit jumbled and cluttered. You may find inspiration even in the mess on your desk, if it's not bothering you. Make or choose your environment to suit you."

      "description":"Put yourself in a calm, peaceful state of mind. Breathe deeply, imagine a peaceful scene, and consciously relax. Relaxing music or sounds of nature can help too."

      "description":"Concentrate on getting something on paper first, without worrying about whether it is any good. You can always rewrite, redraw, or even throw it out later if you still can't make it go. For example, when drawing a figure you should just draw all the parts before worrying about whether it is any good."
