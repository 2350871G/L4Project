If indoors, light the subject so that you can see him or her well, and so that the lighting enhances the form."

      "headline":"Set up your pad somewhere stable, either clip it to a slightly larger drawing board or put it on an easel.",
      "description":"Set yourself up comfortably at arm's length behind your pad. Ideally, you should have full range of arm motion and be able to see the subject fully without moving. It is not important that you can see your paper, just as long as you can draw comfortably."

      "headline":"Turn your pad so it reflects the orientation of the subject.",
      "description":"If it's horizontal the pad may need addition support so the binding doesn't break--an additional bulldog clip or rubber band. Individual sheets taped to a drawing board always work."

      "headline":"Decide where you're going to begin your drawing, size up the pose mentally (try to imagine where the edges of the paper would appear around the figure) and put your pen down on your paper in a place where you think corresponds to how you see the figure.",
      "description":"The head or highest point is usually a good place to start."
    },
    {
      "headline":"From that point, begin to trace a contour (line) in a given direction, both with your eye and the pen.",
      "description":"Throughout this drawing you will be striving to follow what lines your eye sees with what your pen draws. Any contour is valid, whether it's an edge of a cast shadow, the edge of the figure, an internal fold of skin, where an area of body hair meets a bare area, or important background elements. Anything your eye takes an interest in is fair game. However, as much as possible you want to describe the figure in as few continuous lines as possible, so it's good to follow large exterior lines, and then if your find yourself in a corner work your way out of it with internal contours."
    },
    {
      "headline":"If you've drawn yourself into a \"corner\" and want to be drawing at another part of the picture, you can risk picking up your pen and guessing where the new contour would start.",
      "description":"The risk with this is that you will be starting a new shape that can be radically out of place. The alternative is to retrace your current line to somewhere closer to where you want to be drawing. Either way can be charming in the end because there's no good way to be exact about this."
