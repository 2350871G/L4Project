In addition to the alarm sound itself, this is typically indicated by a rapidly flashing red light on the front of the unit. Because the alarm is free standing, it should not have activated other alarms, meaning you only have one to worry about. Be aware that some battery-powered smoke alarms may also be interconnected wirelessly to others or to a fire alarm panel."

          "description":"For most modern battery-powered fire alarms, you can do this by pressing or holding a button on the front of the device for a few seconds. If you have an older model, you may need to unscrew your alarm from the wall or ceiling and hold down a button on the back. For some models, pressing for more than two seconds may trigger a programming mode rather than a silencing mode."

Then, reset the device. If the alarm is still active, remove the batteries entirely. Newer alarms may have a non-removable 10-year battery. Do not attempt to remove such a battery. You will need to replace the entire unit, if it is defective. If the alarm is chirping occasionally instead of giving a full, rapid alarm, it is a sign that the batteries are dying or that the unit has become defective."

Battery powered smoke detectors are available from most supermarkets and home improvement stores. Depending on the quality of the unit, they typically cost between $10 and $50. Many fire codes require replacement of residential smoke alarms at intervals no more than ten years, or whatever shorter time may be listed in the manufacturers' instructions. Check with your local fire department or Red Cross to see if they offer free or discounted smoke detectors. Be sure to install units that are compatible with your existing units, to avoid confusion, especially if they are wirelessly interconnected."

          "description":"Since hardwired smoke alarms may be connected to each other, one going off may cause the rest to follow suit. To silence them, you\u2019ll need to reset at least one of them by pressing or holding down a button located on the front, side, or back of the device. For some alarm models, you may need to unscrew the unit from the wall or ceiling to reach the reset button. Most interconnected smoke alarms also indicate which sensor initiated the alarm, often using a rapidly flashing red or green light on that unit. Resetting the alarm may result in losing that information, although some models also have an \"alarm memory\" function. If only one alarm is active, it may be a sign that the unit is malfunctioning. A short chirping sound would indicate a low battery or \"end-of-life\" condition on most units. If your hardwired unit is controlled by a keypad, consult your user manual for a deactivation code."

If not, you may need to flip multiple breakers corresponding to different parts of your house. Circuit breakers are typically found in a garage, basement, or maintenance closet. If you\u2019re cutting off power to entire rooms, unplug any appliances in the area to keep them from experiencing unnecessary power surges. Some fire codes prohibit installation of all smoke alarms on the same circuit, thus providing some amount of continued safety from remaining units if one circuit breaker is accidentally tripped."

Remove the cord connecting the unit to the house and, if necessary, remove any backup batteries. Repeat  this for every unit. Many user manuals instruct you to first shut off the power before attempting to disconnect the plug powering a unit.

In these cases, call your apartment manager or the local fire department\u2019s non-emergency hotline and ask them to shut it off. Though most system alarm shut-offs can be done remotely, some buildings may require a physical, in-person reset. For safety of others, some fire codes prohibit silencing of alarms by anyone not specifically authorized by the fire department for that incident."

If your new units malfunction as well, you may need to hire a local electrician to inspect your wiring.
