Then cut a crescent shape from one side. You should be left with a slightly off-centre oval shape. Position the smaller shaped cake on the nearest edge of the larger cake. It should look like a nose. Cut a third off the fairy cakes, and position above the sponge for the ears. The image shows exactly what is expected."
