A little tool I use to check a website for original images in their portfolio is that I right on the background of the page, a drop down menu appears and towards the bottom you will see \"View Page Source\" or \"Get Source Code\" If you select view page source it will show you the originating website for any images that may have been copied. Site builder borrow images all the time; nothing really wrong with it if you advise the person you are borrowing from. That changes when you are a contractor trying to pass borrowed images off as your very own work."
