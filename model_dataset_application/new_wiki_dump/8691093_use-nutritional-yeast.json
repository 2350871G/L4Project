Popular choices include garlic, dried thyme, rosemary, pepper, and lemon pepper. Nutritional yeast has zero sodium. If you\u2019re watching your salt intake, leave out the salt when making your popcorn and add nutritional yeast instead."

If salt consumption isn\u2019t a concern of yours, try sea salt, cracked black pepper, and nutritional yeast together on kale chips. Create a spicy topping for your kale chips by combining the following in a food processor:\n2 tbsp (30 ml) of nutritional yeast, 2 tbsp of lemon juice, 1 tsp (5 ml) ground chipotle pepper, \u00bd tsp (2.5 ml) of sea salt, \u00bc cup (59 ml) of cut red bell pepper, 1 cup (237 ml) of cashews (soaked in water for 2 hours), a pinch of cayenne pepper.

The more yeast you use, the nuttier the flavor and the stringier the consistency. You may be able to achieve a richer consistency in your \u201ccheesy\u201d mashed potatoes by adding a tablespoon (15 ml) of butter to the potatoes. Adding butter will make the mashed potatoes not vegan or dairy-free, so you could add oil instead to keep it vegan. Dishes of a similar consistency to mashed potatoes, like scrambled eggs, can also be made into vegan-friendly \u201ccheesy\u201d recipes in the same fashion described for mashed potatoes."
