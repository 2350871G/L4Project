Prevent mealybugs by keeping new plants in isolation from your existing plants for a month or so, watching your new plants carefully for signs of infestation. Don't buy plants showing signs of infestation. Regularly remove dead plant material from the greenhouse/growing space where the mealybugs can hide. Where you have a mealybug infestation in a greenhouse, you can use a biological control, a ladybird called Cryptolaemus montrouzieri. These need fairly high temperatures to work, so are only really useful during the summer months or in a greenhouse that is heated 24/7 in colder periods. Alternatively, try painting over the white fluffy wax with a little olive oil, which will suffocate the mealybugs."

      "description":"Fill a plant pot with loam-based compost that has had grit added to it, or alternatively a proprietary cactus compost. Firm and level the surface. Thinly scatter the seed over the surface of the compost. Cover with a thin layer of vermiculite or fine grit. Cover the pot with a sheet of glass or a plastic bag and place on a warm windowsill, or in a greenhouse. Water whenever the compost starts to feel dry, but don't overwater or the seeds will rot. Seedlings should start to appear within a few weeks, but be patient, sometimes they can take longer. The following spring, your young cactus plants should be ready to transplant into their own individual pots."
