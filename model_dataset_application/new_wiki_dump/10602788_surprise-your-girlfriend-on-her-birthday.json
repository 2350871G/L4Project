          "description":"If there\u2019s somewhere your girlfriend has always talked about visiting, plan out a mini-vacation for the 2 of you to take there on her birthday. You can also simply take her somewhere you know she likes, like the beach, or somewhere she\u2019s never been before, like up in a hot air balloon. Make sure you pick out locations that your girlfriend wants to visit and not just that you want to visit. For example, if you really want to go to a ski resort, don\u2019t surprise your girlfriend with a trip to the Alps unless you think she\u2019d also enjoy going skiing on her birthday. If luxury trips aren\u2019t within your budget, consider driving somewhere nearby, such as the closest major city, for a day trip instead."

          "description":"Even if you\u2019re not a fan of her favorite team, or you don\u2019t like professional sports, going to a professional game would be an amazing experience for her, especially if she\u2019s never gone to one before. Make sure both of your schedules will accommodate an outing to a professional sports game before you buy expensive tickets or begin to make preparations."

          "description":"Be sure to prepare and pack all the food yourself if you take her on a picnic, so your girlfriend gets the benefit of having a meal prepared for her. Whether it\u2019s for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, preparing a meal for your girlfriend is a very romantic birthday surprise, especially if whatever you make is her favorite dish. If you don\u2019t have a lot of experience in the kitchen, don\u2019t try to make anything too difficult for you to handle. The simple act of being catered to will be enough for her! For example, if you\u2019re an amateur when it comes to cooking, make something simple like alfredo pasta and peas. You could also take your girlfriend out to dinner at her favorite restaurant or at a restaurant she\u2019s always wanted to try. It won\u2019t be quite the same as cooking the meal yourself, but she\u2019ll definitely still appreciate it. If you cook her favorite food for dinner, set the table with nice tableware as well to make the meal that much more elegant. Some examples of romantic foods to pack for your picnic might include a baguette, some fancy meats and cheeses, and red wine."

Book a couple\u2019s session so you can be involved in celebrating her on her birthday. If your girlfriend really enjoys the spa, consider buying some lotions and aromatherapy products on your way out of the spa to give her as a birthday gift."

Buy the tickets several months in advance to make sure you\u2019re able to get seats for a showing on her birthday. Use a discount site like Playbill.com to find cheap play tickets way in advance. Alternatively, if your girlfriend is more into music than acting, nab 2 tickets for you and her to go to a concert on her birthday. This is an especially good gift if you can get tickets to see a band or artist that she really loves."

          "description":"This is an especially good idea for a birthday surprise if your girlfriend has ever complained about how messy or unorganized you are. Organize and tidy up your shared living space while she\u2019s at work or out doing chores, so that she\u2019ll return to a surprisingly clean home when she gets back. For added effect, consider using indoor air fresheners or scented candles to make your home smell nice before she gets back."

When you contact her friends to set up the party, make sure none of them blab to her about it so the surprise isn\u2019t ruined! If they live nearby and your girlfriend is close to them, invite members of her family to the party as well. This is a great chance for her to spend more time with them, especially if she usually doesn\u2019t get to. If her friends and/or colleagues aren\u2019t able to participate in a party, the next best thing is to have them all wish her a happy birthday individually when they see her at work or school."

          "description":"Gifts mean a lot more to people when they realize that you put a lot of time and creative effort into them. Try to make a gift that involves skills your girlfriend doesn\u2019t know you have to make it even more of a surprise! For example, if you\u2019re pretty good at carpentry but haven\u2019t told your girlfriend about your skills, consider making her something like a picture frame or a small table. Just make sure it\u2019s something she\u2019ll actually enjoy first! If your girlfriend likes handmade jewelry or accessories, try your hand at making her a pearl necklace or a wooden ring holder. If you\u2019re not that crafty, you can also order your girlfriend a customized gift, such as an engraved picture frame holding a photo of the 2 of you together. She\u2019ll still think it\u2019s a thoughtful gift, even if you didn\u2019t make it yourself."

          "description":"Even if you don\u2019t have that many creative skills, you can make a simple, handmade birthday card out of construction paper, glue, and glitter. Most importantly, write a heartfelt message inside the card that expresses how much you love and care about your girlfriend and what she means to you. If you don\u2019t feel like you have the creative ability to make a birthday card by hand, you can also go out and buy one, as long as you remember to include a heartfelt message inside. Don\u2019t feel like you have to fill the entire card with your message. A few short but loving messages will be better than writing a huge wall of text that doesn\u2019t have as much meaning to it. If you\u2019re poetic at all, consider writing her a romantic poem in the card."

          "description":"This is a great way of spreading out the surprise for her whole birthday rather than giving her one big surprise. Try leaving little love notes around your home in places you know she\u2019ll see them, or put tiny gifts in different spots she\u2019ll be in during her birthday. For example, if you\u2019re taking her out for her birthday, you can surprise her with a gift in the car, then another at wherever you\u2019re taking her, and then another one when you get back home. If your girlfriend has to work for part of her birthday, consider leaving a small gift where she works if you can. You can also send flowers or gifts to her work place, if that\u2019s appropriate at all. Your small gifts can be things like a box of chocolates, a new piece of jewelry, or a bottle of perfume."

Get her a gift that you know she\u2019ll enjoy and that will make her think of you. For example, if your girlfriend has never listened to death metal, you might really surprise her by giving her a death metal CD for her birthday. However, if she doesn\u2019t like death metal, she probably won\u2019t enjoy the gift all that much."
