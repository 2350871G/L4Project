          "description":"A piece of gold will usually be stamped with a mark indicating its type. A stamp of \u201cGF\u201d or \u201cHGP\u201d indicates that the piece is gold-plated, not pure gold. In contrast, a pure gold piece of jewelry may show a \u201c24K\u201d or other marking indicating fineness. Hallmarks are usually located inside the band of rings or near the clasp on necklaces. However, be aware that some hallmarks can be faked. This is why it\u2019s important to use a mark as only one of many indicators of authenticity. The hallmark may be very small. You might even need a magnifying glass in order to see it clearly."

If you see that the gold appears faded or worn away at the edges, then it\u2019s likely wear on the plating. This means that piece isn\u2019t pure gold."

That is why it\u2019s important to examine the piece under a bright light and maybe with a magnifying glass. These spots indicate that the gold plating may be wearing away showing the metal underneath."

          "description":"Hold a magnet directly above the piece. Lower the magnet until it is almost touches the surface of the item. If you feel as if the magnet is being drawn or pulled downward, then the item is not pure. The other metals in the item, such as nickel, are responding to the magnet. A pure gold piece will not draw the magnet, since non-ferrous."

If the drops change the color of the metal, then it is not pure gold. If the color stays the same, then it is pure gold."

If the mark that you\u2019ve left on the stone is solid and gold in color, then the piece is pure. If there is no line or only a faint one, then the piece is likely plated or not gold at all. Be careful with this method as you run the risk of damaging your jewelry. You also have to use the right type of stone or the marks will be meaningless.

After you\u2019ve applied the gel, rub the probe against the item. How the metal responds to the electricity will indicate whether or not it is pure metal. Use the instructions that come with your tester to determine the exact results. Gold is a conductive metal, so a pure gold piece will have higher readings than a plated one."

To use an XRF scanner, place the piece of metal inside, activate the machine, and wait for the read out."
