Use a push broom with thick, tough bristles to apply the soap to the stone. Push the broom over the stone until it\u2019s covered in suds, then rinse with water. Don\u2019t use a wire broom or a brush with wire bristles on a stone patio. Wire can scratch the stone. Make sure not to use any cleaners that advise against using on limestone."

Spray the vinegar solution over the stone and let it sit for half an hour. Then scrub with a nylon brush. Mop the area afterwards to help remove the excess water and vinegar."

Stand a few feet away from the stone with the pressure washer so you don\u2019t break off part of the stone or causing it to flake. A pressure washer can clean basic dirt and grime off the stone. Spray the pressure washer across the joints and not up and down the joints. Make sure not to use a pressure washer too often on the stone patio because it can hurt the stone. Only use a pressure washer once per season to protect the integrity of your stone."

Let it sit for around 10 minutes, then brush the stains with a broom. Rinse it well with clean water. You should probably rinse multiple times. Use thin, plain bleach for this. Don't use bleach that has added detergents and other chemicals. These thicker formulas with added ingredients don't clean as well and may clump on the stone. Just buy basic bleach.
