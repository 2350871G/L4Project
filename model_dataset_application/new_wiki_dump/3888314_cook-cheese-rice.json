You can use any type of cheese you like for this dish, but a mild cheese like mozzarella might get lost in the rice flavor. Good cheese choices for this dish include sharp cheddar, aged gouda, and blue cheese. Alternatively, you can also use 4 to 8 ounces (113.25 to 226.5 g) of Velveeta, cut into small cubes."
