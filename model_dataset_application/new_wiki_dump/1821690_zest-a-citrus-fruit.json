          "description":"Before you get started, run the fruit under a stream of cool water, then buff it gently with a clean cloth or paper towel. A light rinse will help remove the natural waxy residue on the outside of the fruit. You can also give the citrus a quick soak in a shallow bowl of water. It\u2019s important to wash citrus fruit any time you\u2019re zesting, since the outside is the part that will actually be going into your food. Be sure to remove any stickers or labels so they that don't end up in the zest. Organic fruits are better, but should still be rinsed to ensure cleanliness."

Make sure the citrus is completely dry\u2014you\u2019ll be holding onto the fruit by hand, and you may slip if the peel is too wet. A microfiber towel will help remove more moisture from the outside of the peel."

          "description":"Graters, peelers, and paring knives will perform the same basic function, but one may produce a zest that\u2019s better suited to your culinary needs than the other. A microplane grater is the way to go if you want a finely shredded zest that blends seamlessly into sauces, desserts, and other recipes. With a peeler, you\u2019ll end up with slivers of a uniform size and thickness. Slicing citrus fruits by hand will result in an irregularly shaped peel, but offer you more control over the depth of your cut. Any knife with a short, sharp blade will work just fine when you don\u2019t have a more expedient zesting tool on hand. When using a peeler or paring knife, you\u2019ll need to go back and chop the peel to an appropriate size later on."

Make sure you keep the microplane centered over the surface as you work. A shallow bowl will also work, especially if you\u2019re using a small handheld microplane.

Use smooth, light strokes and turn the fruit after every few passes. The basic idea is to remove only the brightest colored part of the fruit\u2019s exterior. If you\u2019re using a box grater or microplane with multiple blades, use the smallest set of holes to ensure that the zest comes out with a fine texture. Applying too much pressure can cause you to cut down to the tough white pith beneath the peel. Pith has a bitter taste that can throw off the finished flavor of a recipe."

It will best when used right away while the oils are at their most potent. Use a sprinkle of finely-grated citrus zest to add tart, zippy notes to cake batter, cookie dough, sauces, or marinades.
