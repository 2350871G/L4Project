Insert the free end of the yarn through one of the edge stitches and then tie a knot. You may even want to make a double knot to ensure that the yarn holds. Another option is to make a slipknot and then slipstitch around one of the stitches to connect it. Loop the yarn around your index and ring finger twice and then pull the first loop through the second loop to make a slipknot. Slide this onto your hook and tighten it. Then, insert the hook into the stitch, loop the yarn over the hook, and pull it through the stitch and the slipknot."
