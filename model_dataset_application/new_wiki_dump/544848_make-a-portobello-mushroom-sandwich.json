  "text":" Clean the mushrooms by rinsing them in cold water and cut off the stems. Set them aside in a dish. Make sure to remove the gills with a spoon if the mushrooms still have them. Apply the pesto to both sides of the mushrooms using a basting brush or a spoon.  Grease the frying pan using the non-stick cooking spray or a little cooking oil on a paper towel.  Heat the pan over medium heat. Once heated, place each bun inside-down on the frying pan to toast. Depending on the size of your frying pan, you may be able to toast two buns at once. Check the buns frequently to be sure they are not burning. Once they are toasted to your satisfaction, remove them from the pan and put each of them on a plate, open-faced. Add the mushrooms to the frying pan while it is still hot from toasting the buns.  Turn the mushrooms using a spatula every few minutes to make sure they cook evenly.  Slice the tomato and/or the onion while the mushrooms are cooking. Place the tomato and/or onion slices on the top halves of the buns. Continue to turn the mushrooms frequently until you notice that they have turned from firm and hard to slightly \"floppy\" when turned with a spatula. The cooking time for the mushrooms will vary depending on the size and thickness of each mushroom. Smaller and thinner mushrooms will cook quickly, while larger thicker ones will take a bit more time.

If you are using feta cheese, sprinkle a bit of feta on the mushroom once you have placed it on the bun. Placing the mushroom upside down on the bun works best for feta since the ridges on the underside will help it stay on the sandwich. Serve the sandwich open-faced for a more pleasing presentation.
