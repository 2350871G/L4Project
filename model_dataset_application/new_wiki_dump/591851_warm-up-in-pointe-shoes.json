Your back foot's weight should be only on your big toe. You don't want the whole platform to be on the floor because then you would be slicing your foot. Your front foot's weight should also be on the big toe, but only bevel your foot as much as you can without straining. After doing this, you can go back to second positioning, turn the other way, and repeat this exercise but to the left instead of the right."

Plie both legs, tendu your front leg, and then, keeping your extended leg straight, step up onto that leg. This is called a pique. You should be in a pase position. Take hold of the barre to steady yourself. See if you can let go and balance. As in the previous exercise, look for a straight supporting leg, strong arms, turned-out legs, and strong, turned-out feet. Close back to fifth, bring the pase-leg back. Close with control. Take a large step back and repeat with the other foot."
