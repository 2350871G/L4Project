After soaking, transfer the cracked wheat to a fine-mesh sieve and rinse it with fresh water. Set the wheat aside to continue draining. Soaking the wheat will help to soften it, and reduce the cooking time."

Cook the cumin in the ghee for one to two minutes, until it\u2019s fragrant and crackling. Other aromatics you can toast with the cumin include chili powder, mustard, and curry leaves. Ghee is clarified butter. You can use regular butter or your favorite cooking oil in place of the ghee."

You can add any vegetables you like to this dish, including chopped cauliflower, peppers, beans, and broccoli."

Bring the pot to pressure over medium heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook the dalia until soft, about 12 minutes, or 7 to 9 whistles on the pressure cooker. If you don\u2019t have a pressure cooker, you can use a regular saucepan and cook the dalia on the stove. Cook the dalia for about 25 minutes, covered, until the water is absorbed and the wheat is soft."

Cook the wheat for 10 to 12 minutes, until it\u2019s absorbed the water and taken on a soft and tender consistency. If the pan does boil over, remove the lid and stir the mixture.

Stir regularly until the dalia reaches the consistency you like. For runnier dalia, cook the mixture just long enough to heat the milk, about 1 to 2 minutes. For a thicker and more porridge-like consistency, cook the mixture for about 5 minutes so the wheat absorbs more of the milk."

Even if you're eating leftovers, be sure to reheat them in a saucepan before serving. When making sweet dalia, it\u2019s important to heat the dalia through after adding milk, because the milk will lower the temperature of the dish."
