Try a rim with sprinkles for any cocktail that pairs well with sugar. Sprinkles go well with creamy cocktails, especially in flavors like sugar cookie or cake batter. You\u2019ll need to rim the glass with stickier liquids, simple syrup or liqueur, since sprinkles are heavier."

With your other hand, press the moistened paper against the glass where the rimmed topping ends. Twist the glass by the stem, 360 degrees, to wipe off the excess topping in one clean line."
