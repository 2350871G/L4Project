If you are trying to create a dichotomous key for a series of animals, you might see that some have feathers, some swim, some walk on legs, etc. For example, if you are trying to differentiate a set of big cats, you might note that some are brown, some are black, some have stripes, some have spots, some have long tails, some have short tails, and so on."

You may also see that all of them have short hair. Finally, you see that some of them have long tails, but some of them have no tails at all. You would start your key with a question/statement about fur color. You wouldn\u2019t need to ask a question about fur length, since all of the examples have short fur.
