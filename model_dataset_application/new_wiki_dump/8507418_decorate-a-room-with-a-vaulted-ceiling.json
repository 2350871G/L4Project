For example, if you want an open, roomy area, keep the walls a bright, neutral color like white, eggshell, or cream. These colors are more reflective and help maximize any natural light in the room.

However, if you want to bring more intimacy or closeness to a room, install curtains. Not only do these add softness to a space, they can also work to draw the eye where you want it. For example, if you choose curtains that fit the entire length of the wall, it will help draw the eye upwards. On the other hand, if you want to reduce how tall the room feels, choose shorter curtains. You can also make windows appear larger by setting the curtains on the outside of the edges of the windows. The color and pattern of your curtains are a good way to add a bit of personality, too."
