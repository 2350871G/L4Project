  "text":" Piped Dog Cover the cupcake with a layer of icing. Make this layer as flat as possible, so that it serves as background only. Make a template for the dog shape.

Draw the design out and place it under parchment paper. Fill the piping bag with icing. Follow the design lines around with the piping bag. If you like the end result, copy this for the cupcake toppings. If not, adjust the design until you are happy with it. Pipe a dog shape onto the cupcake. Following the template design, pipe the dog's outline in a complementary color, or in black or white. At this point, you can leave the outline as it is, perhaps placing a dot for the dog's eye.

Consider adding a collar line in another contrasting icing color. A smiling mouth is another option. Flat Fondant Dog Motif Find a basic dog shape that you like. Draw the shape and enlarge using a grid if necessary. Slip the template inside a plastic envelope/pocket. This will protect the drawing. Roll out the fondant. Use a color that suits a dog, such as white, black or brown. You can also use contrasting colors, such as black and white or black and brown. Shape the design using fondant. Cover the design with the fondant, shaping it as you go. To make raised legs, roll small sausage shapes and stick these in the places where the legs are meant to go. Use the carving tool to scratch on little claws. Add a tail. This should extend out from the design for clarity. Add a nose. This looks best if it's in a contrasting color. Roll a small round ball for the nose. If the dog is spotted, add a few spots or patches in a contrasting color. Smooth into position. Repeat for as many dogs as you need to make.  Allow the dog to dry. Then transfer onto the cupcake. Molded Fondant or Sugar Paste Dog Roll two balls from sugar paste or fondant. Make one ball slightly smaller than the other ball. Place the smaller ball on top of the larger ball. The smaller ball is the dog's head, the larger is its body. Shape the head to make it slightly elongated at the front, to create a \"snout\". Roll four small balls from the sugar paste or fondant. Shape these like fat sausages. Attach to the dog's body where legs should fit. The base of each leg needs to be flat and wide enough to support the weight of the dog. Use a small tool to mark paw lines. The dog is supported by the legs using this method.

Roll two pieces of sugar paste or fondant into teardrop shapes. Attach these to the sides of the dog's head for ears. Roll a small ball in fondant or sugar paste. This is best done in a contrasting color to the head and body color. Attach to the end of the snout for a nose. Roll smaller balls in fondant or sugar paste of an eye color. Add to the face where the eyes should be placed. Roll a thin sausage for the tail. Attach at the end of the dog's body. Allow to set. Place on the cake where you wish to display the dog.",
