They\u2019re both available through the Tools tab (crossed axe and pickaxe icon). Axes cost 1 each of Twig (gathered from dried-out bushes scattered in the world) and Flint (sharp-looking rock that\u2019s scattered everywhere in the game), while pickaxes cost 2 each of the same materials. To use tools, select one by right-clicking on the tool (PC) or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Go up to the tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe) and hold down the left mouse button (PC) or X button (PS4) to wear them down into gatherable materials."

Gathering some Rocks from boulders is also a priority, both for the Science Machine and also for other creations. Gathering Cut Grass from tufts of long grass poking from the ground is also vital for campfires and torches. Rocks can be found scattered everywhere, much like flint, but are less common and are more easily obtained by mining boulders. Everything you gather, save for Logs, can stack up to 40 per inventory slot. Logs stack up to 20 per inventory slot."

A Science Machine costs 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Rocks, and is the very first crafting station you can make. You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading Meats to the Pig King (if he\u2019s available in the current world), mining yellow-streaked boulders (which are predominantly found in Rockylands), or by finding them scattered around Graveyards. Craft the Science Machine where you\u2019ll be camping permanently, since it cannot be moved and carried around once placed. If you want a more advanced crafting station for more advanced ventures, you\u2019re better off making an Alchemy Engine, which costs 4 Boards, 2 Cut Stones, and 6 Gold. You can craft Boards and Cut Stones through the Science Machine on the Refine tab, represented by a diamond icon."

Grass Suits can be crafted at the very beginning of the game and cost 10 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs. You equip them the same way you equip your tools and spear. Log Suits require the Science Machine to make the first time, and cost 8 Logs and 2 Ropes."

          "description":"Once you\u2019re done arming yourself, take stock of what healing items you can craft. Stockpiling Butterfly Wings, Spider Glands, and Mosquito Sacs is a good tactic, but taking some Jerky with you, cooking food in your Crock Pot, and making Healing Salves would be better off in the long run, as long as you have the right resources. Healing Salves cost 2 Ashes (obtained from extinguished Campfires), 1 Rock, and 1 Spider Gland; it heals for 20 Health, compared to the 8 Health healed by the Spider Gland. To make Jerky, you'll need to make a Drying Rack first, which is made with a Science Machine and requires 3 Rope, 3 Twigs, and 2 Charcoal. Upon creating a Drying Rack, you can then place a piece of Meat of any kind on the rack, including Frog Legs, Batilisk Wings, and Monster Meat. Approach the rack and using the left mouse button or X to place the meat. After a few days you'll have your Jerky ready for consumption! You can make a Crock Pot with a Science Machine for 6 Charcoal, 6 Twigs, and 3 Cut Stone. The Crock Pot's cooking mechanic requires you to put in 4 items of food in the four slots to cook, and takes about a minute to complete. Most meals can restore a great amount of Health, as long as you figure out the recipe. You can use Twigs as fillers for recipe, which would usually save you from using up more important \u201cedible\u201d ingredients. Be careful when adding Monster Meats and Durians, though. Use too much without a twig, and you\u2019ll end up with a Monster Lasagna, an incredibly damaging food that gives a hefty penalty to Health and Sanity."

Marshes are very hazardous place to explore, but a quick run through it would usually keep the nasties from getting to you, especially if they\u2019re distracted by the Hounds. Beefalo Herds and Pig Villages work the same, since Beefalo fight back and Pigs dislike them by nature. Once you hear the last Hound die, you can then go back and pick your loot up! Be careful when picking things up in the Marsh, though. If you see stray items there, chances are that a Tentacle is nearby, and they hit hard and are harder to kill than Hounds. If you have the right materials, you can lead them to your own traps, like Bee Bombs. Bee Bombs can first be crafted from the Fight tab with a Science Machine for 1 Board, 4 Bees, and 1 Flint, and are \u201carmed\u201d by pressing right the mouse button or the left direction button. Whenever anything aside from you approaches the bomb, it will explode, sending  the bees at the direction of what triggered it. If you managed to get a hold of an Alchemy Engine and some Hound Teeth from previous attacks, you can make a Tooth Trap with a Log, a Rope, and a Hound Tooth in the Fight tab."
