If you're not using the stems in your current recipe, save them for later. To save the stems for a later, put them in a perforated bag and then store them in your veggie drawer. Use them up within a couple of days. The stems require more cooking time than the leaves, so not every recipe calls for them. However, they are tasty in many dishes. You can cut the stems into pieces for soup, for instance."

It can be a little bitter, though, so just add a couple of leaves at first. For a berry smoothie, mix 2 chard leaves in a blender with 2 cups (470 mL) of water or other liquid. Once the chard is well blended, add in 1 cup (110 grams) each of blackberries and blueberries, as well as 1 medium banana (sliced).

Dry the leaves off so they're just damp instead of soaking, and then drizzle them with olive oil. Sprinkle on salt and pepper, and place 4-5 leaves in a flat layer on 1-2 cookie sheets. Put them in an oven preheated to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C), and let them cook for 3-4 minutes. At this point, switch the bottom and top pans in the oven if you are using more than one.
