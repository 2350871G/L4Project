Grind the soaked items separately. This is best done with a stone grinder, but a high powered blender can also do the job (although the batter will be somewhat more coarse in texture). Grind the soaked rice. Grind the soaked urad dal. Mix the ground rice and urad dal together.  Set aside in a warm place to ferment for 8 hours. Use a crock pot on the \"keep warm\" setting or an oven on the \"proof\" setting if you live in an area where the ambient temperature is below 75 \u00b0F (24 \u00b0C). Add salt.  Oil the idli steamer plates.  Spoon the batter into the plates.  Set the idli steamer into a large, pre heated pot with water in the bottom for steaming.  Steam the batter for 5-10 minutes or until fluffy.  Remove the idlis from the steamer and serve warm with Chutney, or Sambhar. ",
