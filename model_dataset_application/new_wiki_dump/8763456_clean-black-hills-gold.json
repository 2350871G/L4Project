Pour a small amount into a large kitchen bowl, and then fill the bowl with warm water. Although hot water will not hurt the jewelry, it may burn your skin. Make sure that the water in the bowl is warm to the touch, but not painfully hot."

In order to let the dirt and oil on the Black Hills Gold soften up, let the jewelry soak for about 15 minutes. If the jewelry is especially soiled or dirty, let it soak for longer. Water and soap are harmless to Black Hills Gold; you won\u2019t risk damaging the jewelry by letting it soak."

Make sure that the jewelry is wet and soapy as you\u2019re brushing it\u2014otherwise it may not be completely cleaned. Brush both the inside and the outside surfaces of the jewelry, and focus on cleaning any areas that are visibly dirty. Make sure that the toothbrush you use is \u201cSoft.\u201d (You\u2019ll be able to tell by reading the label on the toothbrush packaging.)

Do so by gingerly patting the jewelry dry with a clean, soft piece of cotton cloth or a towel. Avoid using a cloth or towel with large holes or fabric loops in it, as these may snag on the jewelry and risk damaging the Black Hills Gold."

The boiling water will clean grease and oil from the jewelry. When removing the jewelry, be careful not to burn your fingers.

Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol onto a soft cotton cloth, and use this to wipe clean any spots of dirt or grease on your jewelry. As always, when cleaning any jewelry, be careful not to scratch or damage the gold. However, if your Black Hills Gold jewelry contains gemstones that are attached with glue, you should avoid cleaning it with alcohol. The alcohol will corrode the glue, and may result in the gemstones falling out."

Use the other cleaning methods mentioned before attempting to clean with ammonia. If you do choose to clean gold with ammonia, make a weak solution (about 1:6 of ammonia and water) and submerge your jewelry for less than a minute.
