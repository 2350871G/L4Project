  "text":" Making the Patty Mixture Prepare the salmon. If you are making the patties from canned salmon, drain the liquid out of the can and set aside the salmon. If you are using fresh salmon, remove any bones or blood lines from the fish and chop the fillet into \u00bc inch pieces. Grate the onion. Take the onion and grate it against a grater until it yields \u00bc cup (59.15 ml) of onion. Then place the grated onion into a medium bowl. Chop the parsley. Wash the parsley, then remove the leaves from the stems. Take a sharp knife and chop the parsley into small pieces. Sprinkle the parsley into the bowl with the grated onion. You can also add any other herbs you like paired with salmon. Add the salmon, mayonnaise and lemon juice to the bowl and stir. Mix in the salmon, mayonnaise and lemon juice. Stir until all the ingredients are fully incorporated. Add the egg. Crack the egg into a small bowl and use a fork to whip and blend the yolk with the rest of the egg. Then pour the egg into the bowl with the rest of the ingredients. Stir the egg into the mixture until just incorporated. Stir the mixture with a large spoon until the egg is mixed with the other ingredients. Be careful not to overstir, as this can change the texture of the patties. Forming and Cooking the Patties Divide the mixture into four parts. Scoop the patty mixture out of the bowl and divide it into four parts. Make sure that all the parts are equally sized. Form four patties. Take a portion of the patty mixture and gently shape it into an ovular patty shape that is about \u00be inch (19.05 mm) thick. Don\u2019t squeeze the mixture or over handle it, as this can make the patty denser. Repeat with the other three portions of mixture. Chill the patties for a half hour. Place the patties on a plate or baking sheet, cover them in plastic wrap, and put them into the refrigerator. Let them chill for 30 minutes.

Flip the patty over to coat the other side. Then repeat with the other patties. Toss the excess flour. Dredging the patties in the flour will help them to preserve moisture when they are being fried. Heat the olive oil in a skillet. Place a skillet over medium heat and heat the olive oil. Tilt the skillet so that the olive oil coats the bottom. Fry the patties for 4-5 minutes on each side. Once the oil has heated, place the patties into the skillet and fry them for 4-5 minutes. Then flip the patties and fry them for 4-5 minutes on the other side, or until the edges are browned and crisp. Serving the Patties Make salmon burgers.
