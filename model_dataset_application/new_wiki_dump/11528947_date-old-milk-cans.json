Focus on the label\u2014if the letters or words are degraded at all, you might be able to see them more clearly using photo editing software. Aim to take pictures of the milk can at all angles so you capture all the details of the item. If you have difficulty identifying the can later on, bring these pictures to an antique professional, or upload them to a well-informed message board on an antique collecting website. Did you know? If your container is especially large, it might be a milk drum. Milk drums are larger, and hold up to 25 gallons (95 L) of milk. They were used from the 19th century up until the 1920s. If your milk can is smaller (around 5 gallons (19 L)), then your milk can is likely from the 20th century."
