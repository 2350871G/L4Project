If your pantyhose are still wet, and the first towel has become moist with water from the pantyhose, find a second towel. Repeat the process before hanging the pantyhose to dry. Heating the Pantyhose Find a heating vent. If you have a heating vent in your home or available to you, you can use this to your advantage. Set it to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). This vent will act as a dryer for your wet pantyhose. Hang the pantyhose. Hang the pantyhose over a piece of furniture approximately one foot (30.48 cm) from the vent, so that the hot air will hit it and dry your pantyhose.

In a real emergency, and in good weather, you can dry your pantyhose from the window of a moving car. Open the car window. Carefully, hold the pantyhose out of your window so that the legs of them are hanging out. Be sure to maintain a tight grip on them so that you do not lose them while the car is in motion.

Drive to a discrete location. Unroll the window, pull on your hosiery while in the car, and check that all is in order. Then, you should be ready to make your grand entrance.",
