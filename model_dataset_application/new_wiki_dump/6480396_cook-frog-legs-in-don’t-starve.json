You can make multiple campfires as long as you have enough resources. Later on, if you\u2019ve got at least 12 Rocks and 2 Logs, you can make a fire pit, which is a permanent version of a campfire and does not spread flames when you add too much fuel."

Don\u2019t put in too many Monster Meat, Monster Jerky, or Durian in one recipe, since it would yield a Monster Lasagna, which actually damages instead of heals and also inflicts a large penalty on your sanity. Only do so if you plan on adding a Twig in your recipe. A recipe exclusive for Frog Legs is the Froggle Bunwich, which needs 1 Frog Leg and 1 Vegetable, plus two filler ingredients (excluding Honey, Mandrake, and Eggs). It takes 40 seconds to cook and makes for a relatively cheap, efficient, filling meal with a decent bonus to health and hunger. If you\u2019re using Twigs for your filler, use two instead of one, since a single Twig will turn your Bunwich recipe into a Kebab."
