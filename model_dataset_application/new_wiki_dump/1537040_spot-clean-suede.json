The bristles on your brush should be fairly stiff to clean well. This method works well for getting the scuff and dirt marks off of suede shoes. First, lightly brush across the suede in one direction to remove the top layer of dirt. Then, brush back and forth over the area of suede with the stain.

Don\u2019t use a colored eraser, as this can make the stain worse rather than erasing it. Don\u2019t be afraid to rub at the stain vigorously. Consider laying out a towel as your work station, as the eraser can get messy and leave small pieces on your floor, table, or clothes."
