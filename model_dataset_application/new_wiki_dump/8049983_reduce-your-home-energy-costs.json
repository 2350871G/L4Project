          "description":"One of the easiest ways to reduce energy costs is to make sure all of your vents are open and unblocked. While many people believe a closed vent will save them money, the opposite is true. Closing the vent changes the temperature in that spot, but it makes the HVAC work that much harder to get the temperature consistent with the temperature on the thermostat. Make sure your intake vents have clean air filters. Blocked air filters force the HVAC to work harder to circulate air, which increases your power bills and shortens the life of your HVAC system."

Because hot air rises and cold air sinks, circulating the air homogenizes the air temperature in the room. Since that's usually what your HVAC is doing, the use of fans allows the HVAC to rest more. Ceiling fans or freestanding fans both work  for this. In the summer, the ceiling fans should be rotating counterclockwise, and the freestanding fans should be pointing toward the ceiling. In winter, reverse it."

About 13% of a home's energy usage is attributable to heating water and another 13% is attributable to appliances, so this has the potential to cut down on both. You should also avoid overfilling your washer. While it doesn't make much of a difference for the washer's energy usage, a cramped drier has to stay on for longer, and that will require more energy."

Since you aren't home anyway, those are ten degrees you shouldn't miss. Some people are under the impression that the energy spent returning your home to the normal temperature will cancel out the savings from the ten degree adjustment. This is untrue. While it does have an effect, it isn't a large enough effect to cancel out a workday's worth of savings. Another sneaky factor that might be raising your energy costs is a distortion in the temperature caused by placing heat sources next to thermostat. If you move heat sources like lamps and televisions away from the thermostat, it will get a more accurate reading of the temperature in your house."

You'll typically use caulk around windows, weather stripping around doors, and aerosol foam to seal large gaps in out of sight areas (such as inside kitchen cabinets). Since houses, windows, and doors all come in different sizes, there's no typical cost. But it's pretty standard to use about a half tube of caulk on a typical 24\u201dx48\u201d window. Depending on whether or not a threshold is installed, weather stripping a door will cost about $15-$40 per door. A can of aerosol foam costs a little more than $5.
