If this happens, the ham won't reach the correct internal temperature and may not be safe to eat. There are two ways to safely thaw a ham:\nRefrigerator method: Place the frozen ham in the refrigerator the day before you plan to cook it. It will slowly thaw while remaining cold. Allow at least 24 hours for the ham to fully thaw. Cold water method: If you're shorter on time, you can submerge the ham in a large pot of cold water. Let the ham soak in the water for several hours, until it has fully thawed. Keep the water cold so the outer parts of the ham don't get too warm while the inside thaws."
