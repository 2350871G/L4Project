Take a long plastic bag and put it over the top of the plant. Stretch it down to the plant stem, just above the soil level. Then tie the bag tightly around the plant stem. Make sure the seal on the bag is tight and it has no holes so the whiteflies won\u2019t escape. Don\u2019t pull the plant out without covering it first. The whiteflies will flee when you start cutting the plant and will infect other ones in the garden."

Then there is no risk of them escaping and infecting the rest of your garden. Moving the bag to the trash right away could break the seal and let the flies escape."

Rake out dead plants and pull old weeds up. Keep your garden clean throughout the winter. If you\u2019ve had outbreaks of TLCV in the previous season, then don\u2019t compost any of this debris.

If you\u2019re selecting plants, avoid ones imported from these areas. They may already be infected with the disease if they were grown there. If you\u2019re buying seedlings from your local nursery, ask where they came from. Note that this doesn\u2019t refer to seeds produced in these areas. It only refers to seedlings that have sprouted and grown for any amount of time in these areas, and had a chance to get infected by whiteflies. There have been experiments in breeding tomato strains resistant to TLCV, but they haven\u2019t been very successful. The best option is avoiding plants produced in areas where the disease is common."

The whiteflies may return to the same spot and re-infect your new plants. If you plant melons or cotton, these are also whitefly hosts. Locate your tomatoes at least \u20442 mile (0.80 km) from these crops to prevent cross-infestation. If you have a small property, then this probably isn't possible. In this case, clean the area very well before planting to remove any debris that might be housing whiteflies."

If whiteflies are a problem in your area, then cover all your plants to stop whiteflies from colonizing them and spreading TLCV. Some row covers don\u2019t let in enough sunlight to let the plants thrive. Check your brand to see if it instructs you to leave the covers off for a few hours each day so the plants get enough sunlight. 4-6 hours is a common requirement."

Get a bottle from your local nursery or garden store as soon as you see whiteflies on your plants. Spray the entire tomato plant every 7-14 days. Remember to get the underside of leaves as well. Neem oil breaks down naturally and is not toxic to humans or animals. It can, however, cause skin or eye irritations, so wear gloves and goggles when applying it. Don't use strong, chemical insecticides. These can kill other insects that are natural enemies of whiteflies, and consequently cause the whitefly population to grow."

Set your hose to a heavy stream and spray it directly onto the whiteflies. Then spray the rest of the plants to get rid of any colonies you may have missed. Remember that strong hose streams may also damage your plants. Only use this method if you don't have other choices."
