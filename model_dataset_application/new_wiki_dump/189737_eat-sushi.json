These are called maki and they're great for beginners, who might not feel comfortable eating raw fish. A California roll is one of the most popular sushi rolls for beginners since it's made with imitation crab, cucumber, and avocado. A Philadelphia roll is another popular roll for beginners. It's made by wrapping seaweed and rice around cream cheese, salmon, and avocado. You might see temaki listed on the menu. This is like a sushi roll, but the rice, fish, and any vegetables are rolled into a dried seaweed cone."

This is also a great option if you don't like the flavor of a seaweed wrapper. Remember that you'll usually only get 1 or 2 pieces of nigiri. If you want more sushi, order several types of nigiri or order a roll to share."

The green paste is wasabi, which you can eat with the sushi to give it a little heat.Did You Know? Western-style wasabi is made with powdered horseradish, mustard seed, and food coloring. Authentic wasabi is grated wasabi root so it's much paler in color and less spicy. Sushi chefs add some wasabi to their rolls, so try the sushi before adding wasabi to your pieces. You'll also notice pickled ginger off to the side of the sushi. It will be pale or bright pink in color."

If you're eating nigiri, tilt the fish into the soy sauce instead of the rice so it doesn't fall apart. Since the chef has already seasoned the sushi, it's considered rude to soak an entire piece of sushi in soy sauce. Soaking the piece in soy sauce also makes it more likely to fall apart. Try not to mix wasabi into the soy sauce since this is seen as bad manners. If the sushi already has sauce on it, eat a piece before dipping it in soy sauce. You might enjoy the flavor that the chef has already prepared."

Eating all of the sushi in a single bite will allow you to enjoy all of the flavors of the rice, wrapper, and fish. If the sushi is too large to fit into your mouth, you can eat it in 2 bites, but you may want to let the chef know that you prefer smaller pieces. Although some people argue that you must put the sushi fish-side down in your mouth, you can decide which way to eat the piece. Pay attention to how the flavors change as you eat the sushi. For example, you might notice a tender texture at first, followed by a slightly spicy finish."

Avoid draping the ginger on the sushi and eating them together. Ginger is sometimes pale white or bright pink if food coloring has been added."
