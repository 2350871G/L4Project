Do not do more than two applications and do not it apply within 21 days of harvest. Ethyl is useful for corn, sorghum and all small grains but can only be applied with an aerial application. Do not apply ethyl within 12 days of harvesting corn or sorghum, and within 15 days of harvesting small grains. After you apply the ethyl, post notices that the field is being treated, and stay out of it for three days. Lorsban can be applied to corn and sorghum. Do not allow livestock to graze in the field for at least 15 days after you apply lorsban. Do not feed meat or dairy animals grains treated with Lorsban until at least 35 days have passed. Lannate or Malathion can be used on all crops. Do not spray these insecticides within seven days of harvest and stay out of the field for two days after treatment. Methyl is used for aerial application on corn and small grains only. Do not apply it within 12 days of a corn harvest, or 15 days of a small grain harvest. Post notices in the fields, and stay out of them for two days. Warrior can be used in corn, sorghum or wheat fields. Do not apply it within 20 days of corn harvest or 30 days of sorghum or wheat harvest."
