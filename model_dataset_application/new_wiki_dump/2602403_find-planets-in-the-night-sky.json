Starting in August, Mars will begin to climb higher into to sky and continue through the rest of the year. It will become brighter as it climbs. Jupiter: pre-dawn skies are the best time to see Jupiter. It will appear in the 2015 sky in mid-September and continue for months inside the borders of Leo. Saturn: look in the evening twilight sky for Saturn. Saturn will appear in the night sky in November and will be visible in the morning sky by the year\u2019s end."
