          "description":"If you love the flavor of berries, consider adding fresh strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries to the batter. If you use strawberries, be sure to cut them into smaller pieces before adding them. You can also replace fake or dried fruit in the original mix with delicious fresh fruit. For example, many blueberry muffin box mixes have fake blueberry bits or tiny dried berries in them. Pick out the original fruit bits from the powdered mix and replace them with a handful of frozen or fresh berries. Add berries to plain bran muffins or to fruit-flavored muffins."

          "description":"Fresh peaches, strawberries, apples, pears, and bananas are great options, but you can experiment with any of your favorite fresh fruits or use whatever is in season. Dice them into blueberry-sized pieces before you add the fruit to the batter. Diced canned pineapple and sliced cherries can add a refreshing tropical flavor to your muffins. Oranges, grapefruits, and grapes might not be the best options because they don't mix well with batters or bake favorably. Diced fruit works best in plain muffin mixes or mixes that already have a fruity flavor."

If you don't have anything else on hand, even a handful of plump raisins can elevate your muffin mix to the next level. Try this with oat bran muffin mix or intensify the fruit flavor of classic blueberry muffins."

Try adding 1 mashed banana or a spoonful of pumpkin pur\u00e9e to the batter and mixing it in thoroughly. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you could also experiment with carrot or sweet potato pur\u00e9e! You can add a banana to almost any muffin mix that you want with good results. If you're adding pumpkin, it's probably best to start with plain muffin mix."

Then, stir in 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of poppy seeds to create a satisfying crunch. Spoon or pour the batter into the muffin tins and bake the muffins according to the package instructions. This works best for muffin mixes that don't already have a strong flavor, like a plain or bran muffin mix."

Simply stir the nuts into the batter and enjoy! For a little more crunch, sprinkle the top of unbaked muffins with a layer of nuts before popping them in the oven. For a sweeter treat, use candied nuts. Chopped nuts are a great addition to any muffin flavor!"

Best of all, these additives are extremely healthy. Chia seeds absorb a lot of liquid. If your batter feels a bit thick after you mix it up, add a splash of whatever liquid your recipe calls for. The nuttiness will work great with almost any muffin mix flavor you have on hand."

Then, after you pour the batter into the muffin tin, sprinkle a little more of the toasted coconut on top of each muffin. The extra on top will provide a satisfying crunch after you take the muffins out of the oven. Try adding toasted coconut to fruity muffin mixes, like raspberry or strawberry muffins. It also works great in sweeter muffins, like chocolate chip muffins. Toasted coconut goes great with other tropical additions like diced pineapple, dried mango, and cherries!"

You can also try sprinkling M&Ms on top of the muffins right before you pop them in the oven. Feel free to experiment with a variety of flavors.
