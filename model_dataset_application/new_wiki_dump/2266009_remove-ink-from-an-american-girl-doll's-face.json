While that would be unpleasant for human skin, this is exactly what you want for your dolls. This will not stain the \u201cskin\u201d of the doll, but will bleach the stain out. It doesn\u2019t matter if your American Girl is fair or African American\u2013 it has no adverse effect on their skin. Don\u2019t leave your dolls in the sun when it\u2019s extremely hot.

Some stains may take a couple of weeks to fully work out. Be patient, and keep repeating the process until you are satisfied with your result."
