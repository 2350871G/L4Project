There are many roles but here are a few:\nA \u201cDurable\u201d or \u201cTank\u201d is a hero who purposefully draws the enemy attention and takes damage while the other teammates work on taking out the other team and the towers. Good examples of Tanks are Axe, Dragon Knight, and Elder Titan. A \u201cCarry\u201d is the hero who will deal the majority of the team\u2019s damage, theoretically ranking in the most kills by the end of the game. At early game, this role is still weak and needs a great care of the supports for they will be carried in late game.

A \u201cLane Support\u201d sticks with the team\u2019s carry to keep them safe, healing them or replenishing their mana. These heroes generally do not make kills, and accordingly do not get gold. Good Lane Supports include Lich and Dazzle. A \"Support\" focuses on buying the courier and buying the wards to give vision to his/her team. Great supports include Crystal Maiden and Omniknight. A \"Initiator\" starts the clashes and manipulates the war. They have the abilities that can disrupt the formation of the enemies, leaving them unguarded. Great initiators are Clockwerk and Tidehunter. \u201dPushers\u201d are the heroes who focus on bringing down enemy towers as quickly as possible. Examples of Pushers include Broodmother and Leshrac. If you\u2019re familiar with the role of mages in other games, then you\u2019ll understand the \u201cNuker\u201d. Nukers deal damage using spells with large areas of effect, often from a distance. These characters make great Pushers and the roles can be doubled. You can always random if you think you've got what it takes. If you random you'll get 200 extra starting gold.

Later in the game, after winning a hundred battles, you will be allowed to teleport to base for free (which will also heal you). Heal yourself by returning to base. You\u2019ll need scrolls to return to your base, so this isn\u2019t ideal, but it\u2019s preferable to dying so keep it in mind. You can also use tangos. A tango is an item you purchase in the store at the beginning of the game. Use it in order to gain back some health. Using a tango allows you to cut down three trees which are then converted to health. DON\u2019T DIE. Remember, this is a strategy game. A STRATEGY GAME. Not run-in-and-kill-things game. It requires skill and patience. Dying is seriously punished, so you will need to play smart. Dying means you\u2019re missing out on experience and gold, and your teammates are going to get gut-punched while they wait for you. So, yeah, don\u2019t die.",
