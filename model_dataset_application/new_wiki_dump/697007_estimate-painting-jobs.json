You can find this somewhere in the paperwork you signed when buying or renting your home. If you're painting for someone else, ask them for the information. However, if you don't have that information on hand, use a ruler or tape measure to measure the length and width of the home/room.

Doors, windowsills, and trim will all need to be painted, but windows will not be painted, so measure these areas and subtract their measurements from the total square footage. As a general estimate, you can subtract about 20 square feet per door and 15 square feet per window. Say a 700 square foot room has one door and two windows. You would subtract 20 for the door, and 30 for the window, resulting in a square footage of 650."

For a small room, such as the 650 square foot example, it should only take a few hours. Divide 650 by 2,500 to get roughly .25.
