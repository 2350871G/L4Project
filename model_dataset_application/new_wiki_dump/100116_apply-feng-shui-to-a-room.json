          "description":"This map is divided into 9 squares, each one representing an important aspect of balanced life. You can use this map in each room of your home to help you know what to place where. Specific spots in the room and specific objects have best possible energies, and the map helps you determine those spots. There is simple version of the map with just the names of the sections, and a more complicated version which gives examples of what all is represented by that section. Align the bottom portion of the map with the door/entryway to the room. Arrange the things that apply to each section on the map in the proper place in your room. In the lower left, place books which represent wisdom. In the middle right, which is \u201cchild\u201d and represents creativity, place a musical instrument you play or a place where you can paint."

          "description":"It will take time and careful consideration, but if you want to apply feng shui properly, you need to give the process the proper time. Understanding the map and learning what each section represents is the only way you can apply it properly. Some versions of the Bagua map will have slightly different titles than these listed, but the basic idea of each section is intact. Lower left: Knowledge and growth, which can apply to learning and studying, investing in spiritual wisdom and faith, and personal growth. Lower-middle: Career and work success, which focuses on success in current jobs, getting promotions, moving to new careers, and achieving goals. Lower-right: Travel and helpful people, which applies to safety in travels, relocating to new places, seeking people who will help and mentor you in life. Middle-left: Family relationships and health, which means investing in the strength of your family, expanding your social life, and being committed to personal health. Center: Self or well being, which seeks to achieve harmony with yourself and environment, promote health and overcome illness, increase endurance and vitality. Middle-right: Child or creativity, which represents unlocking creativity, bettering communication and building the future. Upper-left: Wealth and power, which seeks prosperity, generating cash flow, and promoting abundance. Upper-center: Reputation and fame, which seeks public attention, becoming well known, and creating a strong reputation. Upper-right: Love and marriage, which includes improving relationships, attracting love, and increasing self-esteem."

          "description":"This map is a guide for what parts of the room are best for certain objects. It\u2019s very important that you do your best to include something for every section because feng shui is all about creating balance. So if you load one section of the room, maybe the wealth section with ledgers and your piggy bank, but you neglect another section, you will upset the balance of the room. Maybe you don\u2019t have a specific object, or enough space, to place something in every section. Something you can do instead is write down on a piece of paper something you care about which represents that or something you desire that represents that section. This can be a stand-in for the actual object. It\u2019s also important to note that sometimes due to room or house layouts, parts of the map may be missing or partial. You can symbolically apply the feng shui to the wall where the missing section would be. Just make your intent for the missing section clear when you place something there."

Most rooms will have a few of these already, depending on the structure of the room and furniture present. Look  around your room and see what elements are already present and consider ways to add the remaining. Candles are the easiest way to add fire to any room. Faucets already bring running water, but in rooms without faucets, consider buying a small fountain which can constantly be running water. Plants are a great way to add earth to a room. If you can\u2019t easily incorporate something physically made of the element, hanging a picture that represents the element is a good alternative."

Energy is able to flow more freely in open space without clutter, so to maximize energy flow in your bedroom you need to reduce the amount of stuff you have there. Carefully go through the room and consider what is there that doesn\u2019t need to be. Do you keep piles of work papers? These will create negative energy. Do you have exercise equipment or multiple storage containers? These reduce the amount of open space in the room. The best balance will be achieved in a bedroom by having more open space and less unneeded stuff crowding the room.

Locate your bed diagonally across the room from the door with the foot of the bed toward the door. In this case, diagonally is meant to express that the bed should not be directly in front of the door, rather at an angle from the door whenever possible. Make sure the headboard is against a wall to anchor the bed. You also want to have space to walk on both sides of the bed, so don\u2019t push it up close against a wall. This positioning is one that promotes protection because you are able to easily see what comes through the door. You will be more at ease knowing that nothing can come through the door without you knowing. If it is possible, place a large rug under the bed to help ground the bed\u2019s energy.

Open curtains during the day, and consider leaving the windows open to allow for the maximum flow of energy. Use soft, ruffled curtains rather than plastic, wooden or metal blinds. If possible, use wood rings to hang curtains with. Close the curtains at night to keep out the dark which brings negative energy. Clean your windows fairly often to make sure that energy from outside can flow through easily. Dirty or smeared windows hinder the energy flow."

Use all of the stove's burners regularly to maintain the overall strength of the stove\u2019s energy. Move your trash can away from the stove to keep the negative energy of the garbage away from the positive energy of the fresh food you prepare on the stove. When you face the stove, you may be facing away from the entrance to your kitchen. Because of this, it is possible for someone to come up behind you without you knowing it.
