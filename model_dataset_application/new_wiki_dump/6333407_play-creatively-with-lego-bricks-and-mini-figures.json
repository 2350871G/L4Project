Try and make secret passages, a moat and drawbridge, a tower, and dungeons! Stick some crocodiles in the moat and create a battle with your mini-figures. Give characters roles like kings, queens, princesses, emperors, dukes, duchesses, fairies, castle guards, and servants. Develop a storyline. Ask questions like: how does the battle play out? Is the frog a lost prince in disguise? Do mercenaries appear and backstab their friends? Who organizes the jailbreaks? Does anyone become a traitor? Add horses, chariots, catapults, and anything else you can think of. Buy LEGO Kingdoms Joust and LEGO Castle Medieval Market Village for the most relevant pieces."

Use mini-figures as pirates, royalty and rich families, peasants, and stowaways. Decide which way the wind is blowing so that you know how to guide your boats through the water. Name important characters and begin creating a storyline that connects the characters in boats with those on the island. Ask questions like: how does the story begin? When ships spot each other, do they become friends or raid each other? Does anyone have cannons to fire? Who is taken hostage? Is anyone shipwrecked? Do the island animals join the fray? How do personalities collide? Does a thunder god turn the tides of the sea?

Is the weather rainy and intense, or sunny and calm? Do the characters get along, or begin to fight? These scenarios give you lots of freedom to do whatever you want! Create a secret overlord that can create walls and scenery, alter with the weather, or abduct people. Decide if the people know about the overlord, or if the whole thing is just a mystery.
