  "text":" Making a Basic Flower Inflate a green balloon and knot the end. Choose a bright, green balloon and inflate it all the way. Let out a tiny amount of air, then tie the end into a knot. You want the balloon to be nice and soft. Fold it into thirds and twist it in the middle. Fold the balloon into thirds so that each end is sticking out just past the folded parts. Twist the bundle by the middle, then straighten it out. Adjust the loops so that they are parallel to the floor. If you were to look at the stem straight on, you should see a vertical line with two horizontal lines on each side (not two ovals). Fold the top of the stem into a 90-degree angle. Take the rounded end of the stem (the one without the knot). Bend it down by a few inches/centimeters. Squeeze and massage the folded part to create a kink, then let go. For a fancier touch, bend the leaves in half upward, then squeeze and massage them before letting go. This will give you curved leaves. Twist a large bubble onto the end, then set the stem aside. Pinch off a segment from the rounded end of the balloon, and give it a twist to form a bubble. Plan on making this a little larger than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Set the stem aside. Blow a second balloon partway to make the petals. Choose a balloon in a pretty color, such as pink or red, then blow it up one-half to two-thirds of the way. Let out a tiny amount of air, then tie the end into a knot. Make sure that the balloon is nice and soft, with a long tail on the rounded end. Make sure that the knotted end has some slack. Fold and twist the balloon into four or five loops. Fold the knotted end over by a few inches/centimeters. Give it a gentle squeeze, then twist it twice to make a loop.

Spread apart two of the petals, then squish the bubble you made earlier on the tip of the stem between them. Let the petals close over the top of the bubble. Your flower is now complete! Making a Rose Choose a color for the petals and inflate the balloon partway. Choose a nice color, such as pink or red. Blow the balloon up three-quarters of the way. Let out some air, then tie a knot into the end. You will have a long, skinny tail on the rounded end of the balloon, which is a good thing. Do the tulip twist into the knotted end.

Give the balloon a twist, making sure that the knot is inside the longer part. Push the tulip twist against the rest of the balloon. This will help hide the twist. Twist a small bubble below the tulip twist, then massage the balloon. Pinch off a 1 inch (2.54-centimeter) segment below the tulip twist. Give the balloon a twist to form a bubble. Massage the air into the rest of the balloon, filling it out completely. Leave some slack on the very end (rounded part). This is important. Twist the rest of the balloon into a large loop. Fold the balloon into a loop, then twist the slackened end around the balloon, just below the bubble. Twist the loop into three smaller loops, then set it aside. Divide the big loop into thirds first, so that you have a rough clover shape. Twist each third at the joint to make a loop. Set the balloon aside for now.

Wrap the knot around the twisted part of the rose to secure it. Find the knotted end of your stem. Pull the knot, and bring it between two of the petals (loops) on your rose. Wrap and twist the knot around the petals until everything feels secure. Pull each petal halfway through the previous one to shape the rose. Pull the first petal halfway through the loop of the second one. Next, pull the third petal halfway through the second petal. Nestle the tulip twist against the petals, then pull the first petal halfway through the third one to close the gap. Your rose is now complete. Making a Multicolored Flower Blow up a green balloon partway and knot the end. Inflate a green balloon two-thirds of the way. Let some air out, then tie a knot into the end. Squeeze and stretch the balloon to distribute the air evenly. This will get rid of the long, skinny tail, and give you a nice, soft balloon. Fold and twist the balloon into thirds to create a stem with two leaves. Fold the balloon into thirds so that you have several inches/centimeters of each end sticking out past each folded end. Give the balloon a squeeze in the middle and twist it twice. For a fancier flower, bend the leaves in half upwards, then massage them gently. Release the leaves to reveal a curved shape. Bend the knotted end of the balloon into a 90-degree angle. Fold the first few inches/centimeters of the knotted part of the balloon down. Pinch and squeeze the folded part for a few seconds to create a kink, then let it go. Set the stem aside. Make sure that you are folding the knotted part, or you won't be able to attach the center. Inflate your first petal color partway, then knot it. Choose a balloon in a pretty color for the first set of petals. Inflate it halfway, let out some air, then knot the end. Squeeze and stretch the balloon to distribute the air, eliminating the skinny tail on the rounded end. Squeeze and fold the balloon into four loops. Fold the knotted end over by a few inches/centimeters. Give it a squeeze, then twist it to form a loop. Do this three more times to form a total of four petals. Pop the rest of the balloon and wrap it around the petals. Twist a small bubble into the end of the balloon. Pop the bubble, then slowly let the air out. Twist the deflated tail around the loops. For extra security, pull the tail down through one of the loops. This will keep it from coming undone. Create another four-petal flower using a different color. Choose another balloon color that goes well with the first one (ie: pink and purple). Blow it up halfway, then twist it into four petals. Deflate the excess balloon, then wrap the tail around the petals, just like on the first set. Twist the two sets of petals together, then arrange them in alternating colors. Place your first flower on top of your second flower. Twist them together by the middle to join them. Arrange the petals so that the colors alternate. For example, if you used pink and purple balloons, you want a pink-purple-pink-purple pattern. Tuck each petal into the previous one partway. Take your first petal, and tuck it into the loop of the previous petal. Tuck it enough so that it is stuck to the previous petal; you don't want to see it sticking out of the loop. Repeat this process until all of the petals are joined. You may not be able to join the first and last petals together. This is fine. Just arrange them so that they overlap on the edges. Blow up a yellow balloon partway, then knot it. Choose a shade of yellow that looks nice with your petals. Blow the balloon up one-third of the way, let some air out, then knot it. Don't distribute the air throughout the balloon like you normally would, but do give the knot a little tug to give it some slack. This is important. Twist a bubble into the end, then tie the knot to the twist. Measure down a little over 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) from the knot, then twist the balloon to make a large bubble. Pull the slackened knot down and wrap it around the twist once or twice to form a loop. Pull the knot through the loop to make another knot. Deflate the rest of the balloon, then tie it off. Fold the remainder of the balloon in half. Pop the remainder that contains the rounded end, then slowly release the air. Tie the deflated part to the knot in a double-knot, just like tying a pair of shoes. Tie the center onto the stem, then add the flower. Tie the yellow bubble and the green stem together by the knotted tails. Take your flower and spread open two petals. Slide the flower onto the joint between the stem and the center. Close and re-tuck the petals, as needed.",
