      "headline":"Use a wine cooler.",

      "headline":"Have your children make a papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 container.",
      "description":"Ask them to paint it and write their names on it. Coat with a waterproof varnish to protect the container. This will remind you of their dedication and artistry for years to come. If there is any risk of water seeping underneath this container, set it up on small trivet to protect it. These can be obtained from dollar stores easily."

      "headline":"Try an old candy/sweets, sugar or flour jar.",

    {
      "headline":"Rescue an old beer stein.",
      "description":"For those who enjoy beer, this can make a great conversation piece. Many steins have fascinating scenes on them that can brighten up the kitchen. Select the larger size in order to accommodate the longer length of kitchen utensils."

    {
      "headline":"Use a steel milkshake container.",
      "description":"You should be able to pick these up in used goods stores and kitchen stores. Older ones will be scuffed and will have rustic appeal. Newer ones will be shiny and will be more suitable for modern kitchens."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use old or unusual vases.",
      "description":"This is especially good when you find the vase too heavy to cart around filled with water and flowers. It is also nicer to keep lovely old heirloom vases on display rather than shut away most times in the cupboard."
