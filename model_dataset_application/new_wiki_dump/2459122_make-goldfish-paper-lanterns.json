Be sure to draw the tail \u00bd to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) longer than you want it to be. Choose a color that closely matches the color of your lantern. Make the base of the tail.

These lanterns make great decorations for underwater themed parties and rooms. Be careful not to get them wet, however! Making a Fancy Goldfish Lantern Get a solid-colored paper lantern and open it up. The smaller your lantern is, the easier it will be to work with. Look for something that is about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) in diameter. Most goldfish are orange, but you can make your goldfish any color you want. Trace a circle that is the same size as the smaller opening on your lantern onto a sheet of tissue paper. Choose a different color than your lantern. It can be lighter, darker, or even a contrasting color. Make the circle as even as you can. If possible, use a pencil to trace around to smaller opening of the lantern. If both of the openings are the same size, simply choose one of them. Trace a larger circle around the first circle. How much space you leave between the two circles depends on the size of you lantern. The bigger your lantern is, the more space you will need. Start with \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) and go from there. Cut the circles out, then save the ring. Discard the inner circle, or save it for another project. Use a glue stick to glue the ring onto the smaller opening. This will create an open mouth for the goldfish. If you have any excess tissue paper hanging over the opening, you can trim it off with a pair of scissors, or fold it into the lantern and secure it with more glue. Cut two circles out of white tissue paper, and two smaller circles out of black cardstock or construction paper. If you don't have any white tissue paper, you can use white printer paper instead. Glue the black circles onto the white circles, then the white circles onto the lantern. Glue the white circles above the \"mouth\" and slightly to the side. Cut out two top fin shapes out of tissue paper. Stack two sheets of tissue paper, then cut a fin shape out; this way, you will end up with two matching fins. Use a color that matches your lantern. Most top fins will be long and somewhat skinny. Make sure that yours is at least 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) tall. Glue them together, except for the bottom \u00bd to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters). Use a pair of scissors to trim of any overhanging tissue paper. The double tissue paper layer will help the top fin stand up. Fold the loose ends of the fin down to create two flaps, then attach it to the fish. Place a strip of double-sided tape to each flap, then place the fin on top of the fish. Run your finger across the top of each flap to seal the tape. Cut out two side fins out of matching tissue paper, then attach them to the sides of the fish. You can use a glue stick or double-sides tape for this. Make sure that you are only gluing the bottom edge so that the fins can flap around. You don't have to create double layers for these or fold any flaps. The side fins can be as long and flowing as you'd like. Cut out two tail shapes out of matching tissue paper.
