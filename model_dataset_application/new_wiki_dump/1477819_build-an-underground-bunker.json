          "description":"Before jumping into anything, ask yourself how big you want your bunker to be. Is it going to fit more than 1 person? How much space do you want? What are you going to put in your underground bunker? After answering these questions, sketch a floor plan along with the length, height, and width. Designate locations for the bathroom, kitchen, washroom, and common area. Consider the furniture that you want to add, such as couches, chairs, and beds.

          "description":"The shipping container acts as the main body of the bunker and is the least labor intensive option for structure. Contact local shipping container companies and select a product with enough space that fits in your price range and needs. If you want, purchase multiple containers for a larger bunker. Standard shipping containers are 8 feet (2.4 m) wide, 8.5 feet (2.6 m) high, and one of two lengths: 20 feet (6.1 m) and 40 feet (12 m). Ask about purchasing used shipping containers for a cheaper alternative. Double-check with your landlord or landowner that you can build your bunker prior to having your container shipped. Shipping containers cost between $3,000 to $5,000 USD"

          "description":"Earthbags are low-cost structural materials that can be purchased from online suppliers. If you're looking for the simplest method of creating your bunker structure, this is the way to go. After determining the length and width of your bunker, buy the appropriate number of bags needed to cover this space. Consider a bunker that is 240 feet (73 m) long and wide: it requires 1,152 bags for both the length and width\u2014240 feet (73 m) divided by 2.5 inches (6.4 cm)\u2014which is a total of 2,304 for 1 length and 1 width. This means that total amount of bags per layer is 2,304 x 2 (since there are 2 lengths and widths 2 per layer), or 4,608. Multiply the total number of bags needed per layer by the number of layers for the total bags for your structure. For example, if each layer requires 4,608 bags and you need 6 layers, you need 27,648 earthbags in total (6 x 4,608). Earth bag height will vary depending on how they're filled. After determining how many bags you need per layer, fill up one bag and measure it's height. Now, use this to determine how many layers you need. For example, if it's 1.5 foot (0.46 m) tall and you want a 15 foot (4.6 m) tall bunker, you need 7.5 layers (15/1.5). Soil costs between $12 to $18 USD per cubic yard."

Not only are they relatively cheap compared to the more expensive materials, but they are also sturdy, easy to install, and great for insulation. Select bricks or cinder blocks if you live in an area with extremely cold weather during the winter. Purchase enough cinder blocks or bricks for each layer of your bunker. For example, if your bunker is 10 feet (3.0 m) long, wide, and high and your cinder blocks are 1 foot (0.30 m) long, wide and high, you need 40 for each layer (a total of 2 lengths and 2 widths) across 10 layers high for a total of 400 (40 x 10)."

After loosening it, grasp the center of the handle with your non-dominant hand and grip the top of it with your dominant hand. Now, start digging your bunker hole from the perimeter of your bunker hole and move inward. Use your foot to firmly press straight down onto the shovel. Use a reciprocating saw or the tip of your shovel to saw through large roots. Loosen rocks with a steel bar. Consider hiring or renting heavy equipment to dig your hole.

The rest of the soil should be made mostly of sandy aggregate. Now, start stacking the first row of bags. Afterward, start stacking your second row, making sure that each bag covers 1/2 of the 2 sandbags underneath it. Continue this process until the top of your sandbags are level with the ground\nAlthough 5-35% clay works too, the ideal amount is 15-25%, so stick to that whenever possible.

Double-check that you have enough cinder blocks or bricks for each layer of your bunker before starting.

Now, drill holes into the outside corners of the rectangle and then remove it using a jigsaw. Always start by inserting the blade through one of the holes. Afterward, place a soffit vent over the rectangular holes and drill it into place with 4 to 6 screws. Cover the air vents on the surface with brush and rocks.
