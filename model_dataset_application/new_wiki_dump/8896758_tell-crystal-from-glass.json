Because of this, the lead inside the crystal can be shaped into thinner, more intricate designs. Hold a glass object next to a crystal one and compare the thickness of the material. On a crystal wine glass, for instance, look for a thinner rim with less of a lip."

Crystal with a higher lead content provides a clearer view of anything inside or behind it. For example, a normal drinking glass will make a liquid inside it appear cloudy. Crystal glasses, on the other hand, provide a greater view of the liquid."

Pick up a glass object of a comparable size. Most likely, it will feel light. Lead-free crystal feels lighter and more durable but still shines when held up to the light."
