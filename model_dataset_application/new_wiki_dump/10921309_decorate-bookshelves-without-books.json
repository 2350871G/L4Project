          "description":"When painting, upholstering, or applying wallpaper to your shelves, stick to a predetermined color scheme. Try picking a bright color and mix it with a neutral color so it won't be visually overwhelming. For instance, try mixing tan with blue, white with yellow, or gray with purple. Another option is to take shades of one color, such as all yellows or blues. You could also paint each shelf a different color to create a rainbow effect."

          "description":"The items you feature in your bookshelves will show look more prominent and eye-catching against a backdrop. Try picking a color that matches the rest of the room, but go a shade or two darker to make it stand out. For instance, if the room has light purples, pick a darker purple in the same tones."

          "headline":"Glue fabric on the back panels of the shelves to tie in your furniture.",
          "description":"Fabric can help connect the shelves to the rest of the room if you use similar textures and colors. Cut the fabric to fit with a little extra to fold over on the ends. Then, fold the edges over and use fabric glue to create a hem all around the edges. Use a hot glue gun to add a few dots of glue on the inside of the shelf at the back. Tack the fabric into place so it forms a backdrop for your shelves. You could also wrap the fabric around the shelves themselves instead. Use the same or similar fabric as ones on your throw pillows or blankets to make your space seem cohesive."

        {
          "headline":"Create depth by installing mirrors at the back of the shelves.",
          "description":"Mirrors make the area look bigger by reflecting the space, so try this option instead of painting or fabric if your bookshelves are in a smaller room. Buy mirrors the right size to place as backdrops on the shelves. Use hot glue or silicone to hold them in place. Measure the inside back panel with a tape measure, stretching it across the length and height to get the proper dimensions. If you can't find mirrors that are the correct size, try cutting a larger mirror to shape."

          "headline":"Stick a fun wallpaper on the shelves for a whimsical look.",
          "description":"Use the wallpaper as a backdrop or even to cover the shelves themselves. Cut the paper to fit, then peel off one end. Line it up on the shelf or the backdrop area, then slowly unpeel the rest of the paper off the back as you rub it into place. Pick something fun and playful or try something serious. Draw in colors and themes from the rest of the room. Most wallpaper is self-sticking. You don't need to use adhesive. You can also try using contact paper if you\u2019re working on a budget."

Add family heirlooms and a few knickknacks that are special to your family to complete the picture. For instance, if your family loves apples, throw a few decorative apples into the mix.

Add knickknacks you picked up on your travels or make a collection of family art. Alternatively, show off your collection of antique smoking pipes or your funky collection of vintage paperweights. Try grouping like colors together to make it look intentional. Prop up anything you want to stand out. For example, you may set something on a small pedestal to make it the most important part of the collection."

Choose things that fit your overall theme and that are funky and unique. For instance, maybe all your items are made of glass. Go thrifting to find similar items made of that same material. If you find something that you like that's not quite the right color, just paint it! This is a great option for dollar store items. For instance, if you have a lot of animal-themed items but your color scheme is black and white, paint tiny plastic toy animals in those colors."
