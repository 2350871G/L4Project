If you want a lamp that will help you see better while you\u2019re reading, choose an arced floor lamp that can extend out over a piece of furniture. There are hundreds of styles of floor lamps, which means there is a great chance that you\u2019ll find one that fits your needs, budget, and aesthetic.Choosing Lightbulbs: Use warm, yellow bulbs for a more intimate, cozy atmosphere. Buy true white bulbs for a brighter, more invigorating feel."

Place the pendant light in the middle of the living room for all-around light, or hang one over a seating area for more targeted lighting. To hang a plug-in pendant light, you\u2019ll need a hook in the ceiling to hang the light from, as well as several small hooks to keep the wire close to the ceiling and wall."

You can place them on either side of a chair or couch, or put a single one wherever it is you like to sit the most. You\u2019ll need a drill to mount the sconce to the wall.

Then run the lights around the edge of the ceiling and plug them in. You could also use them around pieces of furniture, like a bookcase. Make sure to choose string lights that are meant for indoor use. If you don\u2019t want to use nails, you could use pushpins instead."

Even if you already have carpet in the room, you can still lay down an area rug underneath your furniture. Keep your white rug clean by vacuuming it once a week, spot-cleaning stains immediately, and steam-cleaning it every 6 months."

You don\u2019t have to switch out your entire set of furniture, but even adding in one new piece and a white throw blanket can add something new and fresh. If you have kids or pets, this might not be the best choice for your living room."

You can often find white decorations at thrift stores if you don\u2019t want to pay full price for new decor."
