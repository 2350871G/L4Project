For example, \"Pikachu\" is a combination of \"Pika\" meaning \"Flash\" and \"Chu\" meaning \"Squeak.\" As another example, Kartana's name comes from the Sanskrit word for \"Cutting,\" spelled the same way; even so, it also draws from the Japanese word \"Katana,\" the sword, and \"Charta,\" Latin for \"Paper,\" each of which are important parts of Kartana's design. Also notice that there are very few Grass/Steel type Pok\u00e9mon, so the ingenuity of the unique typing and design really pay off. Kartana is an exemplary design in this right. If you can't think of a good name in the moment, do some research or save it until you've built out more elements of the Pok\u00e9mon."

For example, Ghost and Dark Pok\u00e9mon tend to have dark color palettes and eerie appearances, while fire types have a warmer color palette and possibly fire somewhere in their design. Keep in mind, however, that Pok\u00e9mon like Octillery have a very warm color palette, yet are water type, or a Pok\u00e9mon like Tapu Bulu, who has no green on it, is a Grass-Type. Also keep in mind that the Pok\u00e9mon shouldn't be too realistic. All of GameFreak's designs have a cartoonish aspect to them, so detailed fur and eyes similar to real animals creates a disturbing chimera rather than a lovable character."

Most Pok\u00e9mon evolve by level, but Pok\u00e9mon can also evolve by held item, friendship, evolutionary stone, trading, trading while holding an item, being in certain weather or in certain times of the day, when a certain other Pok\u00e9mon is in the party, or any combination of these. Some Pok\u00e9mon can also have different evolution possibilities in the same line depending on their stats, gender, held item, or even personality value.
