  "text":" Making the Crusts Unroll the dough on a flat surface. Remove the case of the pie rolls. On a flat, clean surface, such as a baking tray or cutting board, slowly unroll the dough so it lies flat on the surface. Set down parchment paper or sprinkle flower on the surface beforehand to prevent the dough from sticking. Cut the dough into circles. The circles should be slightly bigger than the compartments on a muffin tray. You can use a glass or cookie cutter to cut out your dough. The number of circles you end up with depends on the size circles you're cutting. Place the circles in a muffin tray. Place each circle in an individual compartment in a muffin tray. Push down the center of the circle slightly so they form small bowls. Spray down the muffin tray with a non-stick spray first. Bake the dough. Consult the package directions for the temperature and baking times. Baking times vary greatly by brand. While you should always read the packages first, pie crusts typically take between 10 and 12 minutes to cook. Making the Jello Combine the gelatin and one cup (240 mL) of water. Pour your water into a sauce pan and set it over the stove. Sprinkle the gelation over the surface of the water. Keep the stove off for now. Let the mixture sit for two minutes. Set a timer for two minutes and set your mixture aside. This gives the gelatin time to dissolve slightly. Turn on the heat. Switch the stove to the medium-high speed setting. Start stirring the mixture. Mix in the pumpkin and sugar. While you stir, pour in your pumpkin and sugar. Keep stirring until all the ingredients are evenly mixed. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Keep the mixture on the stove until it just begins to simmer. Once the mixture is simmering, turn off the heat. Set your mixture aside and let it cool for a few minutes. Add the vodka, cream, and remaining water. Pour your vodka and cream into the mixture. Then, add the remaining quarter cup (60 mL) of water. Stir the mixture using a spoon until all the ingredients are evenly mixed. Assembling the Shots Pour the mixture into the pie crusts. Fill each of your pie crust bowls just to the brim with your pumpkin mixture. It can help to transfer the mixture to a measuring cup with a tip to make pouring easier. Refrigerate the mixture. Keep the mixture in the fridge until the gelatin sets. While times will vary, gelation usually sets within eight hours. Top with whipped cream. After your gelatin sets, remove the shots from the fridge. Top them all with a dollop of whipped cream and then serve.",
