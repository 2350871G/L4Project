Mix well. Place the flank steak into the bowl and coat with the mixture. Cover and place into the refrigerator. Allow the steak to marinate for at least one hour \u2013 but do not marinate overnight."

Once the steak has finished cooking, remove it from the grill and allow it to rest for 5 minutes. Slice the steak across the grain into thin slices."

First, mash the avocados in a medium bowl. Squeeze the lime juice and season with salt. Mix in onion, cilantro, garlic, and cayenne pepper. When the guacamole is ready, cover it and refrigerate it until you are ready to dole it into the burrito. If you don't want to make the guacamole fresh from scratch, you can use pre-made or store-bought guacamole. Feel free to simply slice avocado directly into the burrito. Avocado (in whatever form) is a crux of the California burrito."
