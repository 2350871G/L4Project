This is especially important for clothes and shoes -- if you don\u2019t wear it, you don\u2019t need it.

          "description":"Changing the color of your walls can make a dramatic impact on the way your room looks. Choose a color you love that complements items you know you're going to keep and display, such as a dresser or favorite piece of artwork. Start by moving everything away from the walls and masking the baseboards and ceiling. Apply a coat or 2 of primer and let it dry fully. Then, paint the walls with a roller using long, even strokes. To make your room look more airy and open, choose a light color such as white, gray, or yellow. For a more dramatic effect, you can paint one wall a bold color and the rest a subtle hue. There are tons of cool paints to try, like chalkboard paint or magnetic paint."

Pick a color or pattern you truly love since wallpaper is more difficult to remove or redo than simply painting the walls. Measure your room before purchasing wallpaper and be sure to get a little extra in case of any issues. If your wallpaper is patterned, take care to line up the pattern when you add a new strip! You can use removable wallpaper if you don't want to commit to the print or color permanently."

You can use interlocking shiplap boards or even simple 1 by 6 in (2.5 by 15.2 cm) boards cut to the length of your walls. Work your way from the bottom of the wall to the top. You can do all your walls for a cohesive look or even install shiplap on a single accent wall. Paint the shiplap white for a clean, nautical feel or simply stain the wood for a more natural look."
