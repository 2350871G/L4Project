Let the oil or butter coat the pan evenly and heat it until begins to sizzle.

Frying the bacon first will release its flavors so that they can be absorbed the cabbage and other ingredients. Bacon should be cooked until the fat renders, not until the meat becomes dark.

Add the cabbage, along with salt, pepper and any other spices you prefer to taste. Pour in a splash of water to deglaze the pan and keep the ingredients from sticking. \u201dGlazing\u201d occurs when heated food residue forms a bond with a cooking surface, causing it to stick.

The amount of time the cabbage requires to cook will depend on the consistency of the cabbage and the amount you\u2019re preparing, but will probably take between 5-10 minutes.

Stir in \u00be to 1 full can of tomato paste to reach the desired thickness. Throw in salt, pepper, chili powder, coriander, parsley or cilantro and stir or toss. You may also use chopped fresh tomatoes in place of tomato paste. These should also be added along with the cabbage and may require an additional 5-10 minutes to stew. If the mixture is too thick after incorporating the tomato paste, try adding a few ounces of water and covering the pan to let the liquids set up. This will also prevent the frying vegetables from burning or sticking."

          "description":"Cook the mixture together, uncovered, for approximately 15 minutes. This will allow time for the sauce to thicken up and the flavors of the individual ingredients and seasonings to mingle. When the cabbage looks soft and tender, remove the mixture from the heat and serve it while it\u2019s piping hot! Recipes for fried cabbage with tomato sauce come from around the world, but are especially popular in Eastern Europe. Cabbage stewed with tomato sauce can be served as a hearty side dish, or as a main course with a starchy component like steamed rice, potatoes or fresh bread."

Searing will release the pungent flavors of the onion, garlic and ginger so that they can be absorbed by the cabbage. The edges of the onion should just begin to brown once it is caramelized. The process of unlocking aromatic flavors from pungent herbs and vegetables is the first step in preparing many Chinese dishes."
