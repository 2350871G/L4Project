If you\u2019re driving the car, place both hands on the steering wheel in the \"10 and 2\" positions. The impact of your car hitting the water could set off the airbag system in your vehicle, and any other brace position could cause serious injury in such an event. Don\u2019t try to brace yourself if you\u2019re a passenger. Putting your head down or raising your arms could increase your chances of being injured in the crash."

Say to yourself, \u201cI need to unbuckle my seatbelt, open a window, and get out.\u201d\nYou will have only about 30-60 seconds to act before your car sinks below the water and escape becomes nearly impossible."

(Seatbelts off, Window open or broken, Out (Children First)) protocol developed by car safety expert Dr. Gordon Giesbrecht. If there are children or other passengers in the car who may need help, don\u2019t worry about unbuckling them yet.

Once there is water pressing against the window, it will become nearly impossible for you to open or break it. If your car has electrical windows, they should continue to function for a few minutes after you enter the water. Don\u2019t try to escape through a door. The pressure of the water outside the door will make it nearly impossible to open within a few seconds of impact with the water. Even if you do manage to open the door, it will cause the car to flood with water and sink more quickly."

If you don\u2019t have a glass-breaking tool (such as a center punch or a glass-breaking hammer) on hand, remove a headrest from one of the seats and strike the lower corner of a window several times with the tongs on the bottom. Since the front of the car is heaviest and will likely sink first, don\u2019t try to escape through the windshield. The windshield is also designed to be more difficult to break than the other windows. Instead, break the driver\u2019s side window or a rear passenger window. If you have no tools or heavy objects to break the window with, use your feet. Kick near the front of the window or along the hinges rather than in the center."

Take a few slow, deep breaths while there is still air in the car, then unlock the nearest door. Once the car is full of water, the pressure inside and outside the car will equalize, making it possible to open the door. Hold your breath and push hard against the door while pulling on the handle to open it, then swim up and out. It takes 60 to 120 seconds (1 to 2 minutes) for a car to fill up with water. Unfortunately, your chances of successfully escaping in this situation are very low unless you have an oxygen supply. Continue to breathe normally until the water is at chest level, then take a deep breath and hold your nose. Stay calm. Keep your mouth closed to preserve your breath and to prevent water from entering. If exiting via an open door, place your hand on the door latch. If you are unable to see it, use a physical reference by stretching your hand from your hip and feeling along the door until you locate the latch."
