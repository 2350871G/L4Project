  "text":" Folding a Fitted Sheet Remove the fitted sheet from the dryer. This is the sheet with the elasticized edges that hugs the mattress. Turn the fitted sheet inside out. Stand while gripping the sheet in front of you. You'll put your hands in 2 adjacent corners (the fitted parts) on 1 of the sheet's shorter sides, because you'll be folding these corners together. Bring your hands together. Fold the bed sheet corner in your right hand over the corner in your left hand. Fold the other corner. Keep the 2 corners of the fitted sheet on your left hand. Reach your right hand down and grasp the corner hanging in front. Raise that corner and fold it over the 2 corners in your left hand. The visible corner will be inside out. Now grab the last corner and fold it over the other 3 corners on your left hand. Place the folded fitted sheet onto a flat surface and straighten it. Fold the 2 ends in so that the elasticized area is lying on top of the sheet. Fold the sides over so the elasticized edges are hidden, then continue folding into a rectangle that's the size you want. Iron it while folded if needed. Folding a Flat Sheet Hold the flat sheet in the top 2 corners, longways. Your arms might not be long enough to hold it taut, in which case you can ask someone for help, or you can place the sheet on the ground, so you can get it flat. Fold sheet in half. You'll want to fold it so that the adjacent corners match up and you'll be folding it on the long sides. Smooth the surface once you've folded it to keep wrinkles from forming. Fold again. You'll be folding along the first fold, so that you end up with a long, narrow rectangle. Smooth gain. Make the final fold. You should really only have to fold your flat sheet 3 or 4 times, depending on the size of the sheet. This time you'll fold the top down and line up the corners. You can fold it one more time, which will give you a more squarish folded sheet. Folding a Pillowcase Hold the pillowcase in front of you. You'll want to fold from the bottom (it makes the pillowcase less wrinkled), across the shorter side. Fold once across the shorter side. You'll now have a long rectangular shape, which you'll need to smooth down. Fold two more times. Smooth each time after you fold so that the pillowcase is not wrinkled. You should end with a small, rectangular stack.",
