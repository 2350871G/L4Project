          "description":"There are two kinds of springs your garage door might use: side-mounted extension springs or torsion springs. Before you can adjust the spring on your garage door, you must determine what kind of springs your door has. Side-mounted springs are easier to adjust, while torsion springs are more dangerous to meddle with, so you would be better off calling a professional if you have these. Side-mounted extension springs run above and parallel to the door track, and they'll have an attached pulley and cable. The cable, which holds the spring, attaches to hooks in the track hanger assembly. There will be two springs: one above each track on either side of the garage door."

          "description":"Torsion springs are mounted above the door and will run along a metal shaft that's parallel with the top of the door. This type of mechanism is usually used for doors that are over 10 feet wide. Lighter and smaller doors may only have a single torsion spring, while larger and heavier doors may have two springs, with one located on either side of the central plate."

          "description":"Improper spring tension can cause many problems with how your garage door opens and closes. The problem you're having will help you figure out how you need to adjust the spring to fix the door. Doors that need spring adjustments may:\nBe difficult to open or close\nOpen or close too quickly\nNot close fully or properly\nClose unevenly and leave a gap."
        },

          "headline":"Determine your solution.",
          "description":"Depending on your problem, you will either need to increase or decrease the spring tension on the door. You will need to:\nDecrease the tension if your door isn't closing fully, is difficult to close, or opens too quickly. Increase the tension if the door is difficult to open or closes too quickly. Adjust the tension on one side (where the gap is) if your door is closing evenly."

          "description":"There are some basic tools and safety equipment you'll need for this job. Your safety equipment includes gloves, safety glasses, and a hard hat. Your other tools are a sturdy ladder, a C-clamp, an adjustable wrench, and a marker or masking tape. If you are going to be adjusting torsion springs, you will also need two winding bars or solid steel rods. The rods or bars should be 18 to 24 inches (45.7 to 61 cm) in length. Solid steel bars can be purchased at hardware stores. You will need to measure the diameter of the holes in the winding cone (the collar that secures the spring to the metal shaft) to determine what size bar or rod to use. Most cones have a hole diameter of 1/2 inch. Do not attempt to use any sort of tool as a substitute for the winding bars or steel rods."

To decrease tension and fix a door that isn't closing fully, is difficult to close, or opens too quickly, hook the spring onto a lower hole on the track hanger. This reduces the length of the spring and the tension on it.
