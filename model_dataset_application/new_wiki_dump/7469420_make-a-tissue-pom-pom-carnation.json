  "text":" Gather your supplies together. You will need paper tissue napkins, scissors, pipe cleaners (aka \"fuzzy wire\"), a stapler, some florist tape and a pair of scissors. Fold a paper tissue napkin into fourths.  Lay two pipe cleaners across the folded napkin diagonally.  Staple the pipe cleaners in place using at least two staples. Crossing the staples is helpful in holding these in place long term. Twist the pipe cleaners together to form a stem.  Cut the corners of the napkin away to create a circle with all \"raw\" (no folds left) edges.  Clip the outer edge of the napkin circle to create \"tabs\" or \"teeth\" or \"flaps\".  Lift the top layer of tissue and scrunch it together into a point of sorts.  Lift the next layer of tissue and crumple/scrunch it up and around the first layer. Continue crumpling/scrunching layer by layer until you have only the bottom layer of tissue napkin left. Fold or wrap the bottom layer of tissue down and around the pipe cleaner stem.  Cut a length of florist tape (around 20 inches is fine) and wrap the bottom layer of tissue to the pipe cleaner stem. Continue wrapping snuggly to the end of your pipe cleaner wires.
