          "description":"Do a little spring cleaning. This gives you an opportunity to sort through all the things you own. It will be more than you expect, so take an inventory. Try to sort your possessions into groups of necessities, things you would like to save, and things you\u2019re willing to discard. Also sort similar items into groups to be packed together. For instance, pack pots and pans together."

          "description":"The big expense is in the amount of stuff you need to transport, but this is something you can control. Throw away anything you can live without. Large items in particular are difficult to move, so leave furniture and bulky electronics if you can. For example, food, books, toys, and clothing may be easier and cheaper to replace instead of move. Leave behind items that are well worn. Your old TV, for instance, might cost more to ship than it is worth."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Leave behind heavy items like furniture.",
          "description":"Large, heavy objects are the costliest to move. Items like couches, chairs, and bookcases can often be left behind and replaced for less once you move. Carefully calculate these into your moving expenses later and decide if they\u2019re worth the trouble. For example, you could get rid of your couch and pick up a used one from Craigslist or a secondhand shop after you have moved into your new residence."

          "headline":"Sell anything you don\u2019t want to keep.",
          "description":"Visit sites like Craigslist to post listings for your items or have a yard sale. You get to reduce your moving burden while making some extra cash. It\u2019s a great way to offset some of the cost of moving."

          "description":"Visit stores and ask them nicely for spare cardboard boxes. Many shops throw away the boxes so they\u2019ll give them away for free. Fast food restaurants, bookstores, and liquor stores are some places that tend to have plenty of strong cardboard boxes to give away. Also look online at sites like Craigslist, Freecycle, or the U-Haul message boards. Someone nearby may have boxes for you."

          "description":"An unexpected expense happens if you end up living in a hotel or moving somewhere you don\u2019t like. Save money by arranging to stay with friends or family in the area. Cheap rooms through Airbnb and similar services are also good options until you find a permanent home. You can do research at home to find a permanent residence, but it\u2019s never as good as visiting in person."

          "headline":"Decide on how you will get yourself across the country.",
          "description":"Plan your own trip, keeping in mind that your choice is heavily related to how you want to move your possessions. Flying is the quickest and least stressful option, but it means packing light. Driving is arduous and means extra costs and planning, so consider what option best fits your situation. With flying, you won\u2019t need to plan as much for fuel, food, or places to sleep. With driving, you can bring your own vehicle or drive a moving truck with your possessions. Another option is taking a bus or train. This is also a cheap way to travel lightly."

        {
          "headline":"Factor in moving costs for any pets you bring.",
          "description":"Bringing along a pet is another significant cost to research. Count on having a carrier cage, a supply of food, and visiting places that are pet-friendly. If you\u2019re flying, research how much airlines charge for pets, what health documentation you need,  and where they put them on the plane. Moving is stressful for pets, so take precautions to make the trip as safe and speedy for them as possible."

Read about and consider the benefits and drawbacks of the service to figure out which one works best for your situation. The cheapest way to move is to pack lightly and fly, drive, or ride a train across the country. However, you may have to sacrifice more of what you own. Hiring a moving service is costly, but you don\u2019t have to worry about moving your possessions. You can then save money by flying to your destination."

You can also affordably send heavier possessions, like books, through ground shipping. This is a great way to save money if you plan on traveling light or can\u2019t fit everything into another transportation option. You will need somewhere to send these items. Arrange for a place to stay in advance or ship them to someone you know who can get them to you when you arrive."

If needed, pack extra suitcases for a small charge. Even with the fees, this can be a surprisingly cheap option. This kind of moving involves checking the bags in on a flight you will be taking. Bring the bags up to the check-in counter when you arrive at the airport. Pack lightly, since each extra checked bag comes at a price. Remember that you will need to transport each bag to and from the airport yourself."

It\u2019s not as fast as using a plane, but it is cheaper than using a moving truck. These services usually accept heavier boxes and furniture.

You will need to pay for gas and unload all of your gear yourself, but you get to bring your vehicle with you if you have one. Check that you are able to drop off the trailer in your new destination. Not all companies allow this, and it would be unpleasant to have to drive all the way back to return the trailer. You can also rent larger trucks from these companies. They\u2019re a little more expensive than trailers and you would need someone else to drive your vehicle if you have one to bring along."

The contractor will deliver it to your new home, so you can take the cheapest transportation method available. Receiving good bids isn\u2019t guaranteed and takes time, so put up the listing weeks in advance of your move. Using this service involves trusting the contractor.
