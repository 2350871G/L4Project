If you choose to use toothpaste, any kind of toothpaste, i.e., Arm & Hammer, Colgate, or Aquafresh, will work. If you choose to make a baking soda paste, depending on how large the object is, use a teaspoon (for smaller objects like jewelry) to a tablespoon (for larger objects like tabletops or pots) of baking soda. Then gradually mix in water until a paste forms. Gradually mix in the water by alternating mixing with water. For example, add a few drops of water, mix, and then gradually add more water until a paste forms."

After using the toothbrush, instead of throwing it away, store it with your cleaning supplies so you can reuse it again."
