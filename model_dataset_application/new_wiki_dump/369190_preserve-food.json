If you have questions about whether the food is still good, err on the side of caution and do not eat.

Keep meats in the packages they came in from the store until you use them. Do not store fruits with vegetables -- fruits can give off high levels of ethylene, which causes fruit and vegetables to ripen. Stone fruits (peaches, plums, avocados, etc.) should be allowed to ripen on the counter, but berries and citrus should be refrigerated. For vegetables, remove any ties or rubber bands before refrigerating. Pack vegetables loosely in the refrigerator -- it\u2019s best not to let them touch."

If you don\u2019t have a vacuum sealer, try to at least get as much air out of the bags as you can before sealing. Label everything in your freezer with the contents and date with a marker and freezer-friendly masking tape (it will be specially marked). Do not freeze glass containers. Do not fill containers to the top with leftovers before freezing (it will expand). Do not put hot food into the freezer -- let it cool first so the freezer doesn\u2019t have to do so much work and bring up the temperature of the entire appliance. Do not thaw and re-freeze food.

          "description":"By dehydrating your food, you take all of the liquids out. Once fully dehydrated, it\u2019s very difficult for bacteria to form, creating a food that can last for weeks or months without refrigeration. The content of the food, including fiber content and calories, stays the same with dehydrating (except for a loss of Vitamin C in some foods because of its solubility). With a food dehydrator, available at some grocery stores and at many places online, you can preserve fruits, vegetables, and meats. If you don\u2019t want to buy a dehydrator, you can also get the same effect from a low-temperature oven. Use the oven on the lowest possible setting, place your food on a non-stick pan, and use a small fan to keep the air circulating and prevent any moisture buildup. The process takes all of the liquid out of the foods, preserving it in a new, chewier form. Once dehydrated, you can store these foods without refrigeration for weeks. Dehydrating is particularly good for backpacking trips or other times when you need to carry your food with you."

The kinds of wood for the fire and the spices you put on the meat itself can create an array of delicious flavors on the meat. There are two kinds of smoking \u2013 hot and cold. The differences are as follows:\nWhen you smoke meat using the \u201chot\u201d method, you are cooking it at a low temperature (150 degrees Fahrenheit and up) for a long time. The \u201ccold\u201d method, on the other hand, is at less than 100 \u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C) and is not really meant to cook the meat at all, but rather to seal the meat enough so that bacteria cannot grow in it. This method works particularly well if you\u2019re planning to cook the meat at some other point in the future."

          "description":"Like smoking, curing is a process that has been around for thousands of years. The process involves using salt to leach the water out of meat, essentially dehydrating it. There are two main ways of curing meats:\nDry curing involves rubbing the meat with salt and sodium nitrite and other spices of your choosing. The meat is then typically hung to dry. For safety, it\u2019s best to purchase a prepared mixture of salt and nitrate -- the amount should be about 1 teaspoon per 5 pounds of meat, but follow any directions on the mix that dictate amounts. Wet curing or brining also uses salt, but in a liquid solution. Meat is placed into a \u201cbrine\u201d made of water, salt, sodium nitrite, and other spices to cure. The typical mixture is about 1 \u00bc cups of kosher salt per gallon of water."
