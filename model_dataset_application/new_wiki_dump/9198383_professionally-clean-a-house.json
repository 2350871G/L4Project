Bend the extendable duster at an angle that allows you to run it along the edge of the light fixture. Move around the perimeter of the light fixture until it is totally free of dust. Remove cobwebs using a duster with a cleaning extension. A duster with a cleaning extension will allow you to get those hard-to-reach ceiling corners where cobwebs collect. Just wipe the duster along the cobweb to snag it, then pull it down and put the cobweb in the bin. Alternately, you could use the extension on your vacuum to remove the cobwebs.

These products might give the furniture a nice shine, but over time, they can damage the surface. Dust electronic appliances using a microfiber cloth. Gently wipe TVs, DVD players, computer monitors, printers, and stereos with a clean microfiber cloth. Be careful not to press against the actual screen on TVs and monitors. Use a soft-brush vacuum attachment to remove dust from vents. Move the soft-brush vacuum attachment over the vent in a back-and-forth motion to loosen and collect dust. Next, dampen a microfiber cloth and wipe the vent down to remove any remaining dust particles. Move large appliances away from the wall to remove the dust behind them. If possible, move refrigerators and washing machines slightly away from the wall and use a vacuum extension to suck up dust and crumbs that might have collected there. Unplug the appliance, then use a long-handled, slightly damp sponge mop to wipe dust from the back of the appliance itself. Before replacing the appliance, wipe the floor and walls with hot, soapy water. Caring for Floors Sweep hard floors using a broom and dustpan. Mentally divide the floor up into small sections of approximately one square meter (one square yard). Starting from the section furthest from the room\u2019s exit, sweep each section using short strokes. Collect the debris and dust in a central pile. Once you\u2019ve swept everything into a small pile, sweep it into your dustpan. If your dustpan leaves behind a thin line of dust or dirt, wipe it up with a damp paper towel.

Consult your vacuum\u2019s user guide for more information. Check the vacuum bag or collection container before starting. If it\u2019s full, empty it. Mop hardwood, vinyl, and other hard floors. Fill a mop bucket with a mild or pH-neutral soap and warm water. Dip the mop into the water and wring it out. The mop should be slightly damp, not saturated. Begin mopping the room in parallel strips, starting from the corner furthest away from the exit. If you\u2019re mopping wood, mop in the same direction as the wood grain. If you\u2019re mopping a floor with a textured surface (like tile), wipe using small figure eight movements. As you work, rinse the mop out when you notice it is getting dirty. Dunk the mop in a second bucket filled with warm water to rinse it off. Then wring it out, dunk it in the soapy water bucket, and wring it out again. If mopping an area with throw rugs or runners, roll them up first. Do not attempt to mop around them. Cleaning the Bathroom Spray the sink basin, faucet, sink handles, and counter-top with a disinfectant. Wait about five minutes while the disinfectant works, then dampen a microfiber cloth with warm water. Wring it out and wipe the disinfectant from the sink and the other areas you sprayed. There are many disinfectants you could use to clean the sink and countertop. For instance, you could mix two parts rubbing alcohol, two parts distilled white vinegar, and three parts water for a simple homemade disinfectant. Clean the toilet bowl with a toilet brush and an all-purpose spray. Spray an all-purpose cleaner around the inside of your toilet bowl, then scrub it with your toilet brush. Flush the toilet after you\u2019re done cleaning, then trap the brush between the toilet seat and the rim of the toilet bowl to allow the brush to drip-dry. Disinfect the toilet. Just you did with the sink and counter-top area, spray the inside of the toilet lid and the toilet seat with your disinfectant of choice. Wait five minutes, then wipe them down with a damp paper towel. Discard the paper towel after using it. Check the sides and base of the toilet, too. If they are visibly dirty, spray them with the disinfectant and, after five minutes, wipe away any grime with a paper towel. Wipe tile grout with a grout brush dipped in bleach. If your shower or bathroom floor is tiled, dip your grout brush in bleach. Scrub any discolored areas between the tiles. If you\u2019re cleaning shower tile, rinse it off using the shower head. If you\u2019re cleaning grout on the bathroom floor, wipe the bleach away using a soft, damp cloth. Open the windows and doors before using bleach, since it can irritate the lungs. Protect your hands by donning a pair of disposable gloves before using bleach. Clean tubs and showers with an all-purpose cleaner. Spray tubs and showers (including shower doors and walls) with an all-purpose cleaner, then turn the shower on and exit the bathroom. Close the door behind you, then wait about 20 minutes. The steam will loosen caked-on shower grime. Use a clean cloth or a dry microfiber mop to wipe tub and shower surfaces clean. There\u2019s no need to plug the tub when cleaning tubs and showers. Offering More Cleaning Services Make the bed. To make the bed like a pro, take everything off it -- pillows, sheets, and blankets. Stretch the fitted sheet snugly over the mattress. Lay the sheet over the bed so that the top edge covers the head of the bed and the sides hang down evenly. Fold the sheet back from the head of the bed by about 20 inches (50 cm) and tuck the sides of the sheet in under the mattress. To finish making the bed, tuck the third edge of the sheet beneath the foot of the bed, then spread the blanket over the bed in the same way you laid out the sheet. Fold the blanket in half toward the foot of the bed, then fold it in half again. Lay the pillows in their place at the head of the bed. Wipe down mirrors and glass surfaces using a cleaning solution of vinegar and water. Windows, mirrors, and glass tabletops should be cleaned with a mixture of one part white vinegar and four parts distilled water. Fill a spray bottle with the mixture, then spray a clean microfiber cloth with the mixture. Rub the cloth across the surface in a gentle circular motion to remove all the spots and smudges. Wipe the entire surface again using only vertical strokes, then wipe it a third time using only horizontal strokes. Use a cotton swab sprayed lightly with the cleaning solution to clean the corners of windows and mirrors. Wipe excess cleaning solution away with a dry cloth. If you\u2019re cleaning a window, place towels beneath it to catch any cleaning solution that might drip down. Wipe the baseboards using dryer sheets. Dryer sheets are designed to attract dust and lint in the laundry, so they are the ideal tool for dusting baseboards. Simply kneel near the dusty baseboard and run the dryer sheet along its entire length. Continue moving around the perimeter of the room until all the baseboards are dust-free. Take out the trash and replace all the trash bags. Remove all the trash bags from around the house. Place them all by the curb or in the bin (whichever your client prefers). Put new trash bags in every trash can. Clean the windowsills with hot, soapy water. Fill a bucket with hot, soapy water. Dip a clean cloth into the water and wring it out. Wipe the sill down using a scrubbing motion. If some grime remains behind after one pass, dip the cloth into the water, wring it out again, and give the sill another wipe. Wipe down doors with an all-purpose cleaner. Wipe the top and side edge of the door down with a feather duster or a soft rag. Spray both sides of the door (including the door handles) several times with an all-purpose cleaner. Use a clean cloth to wipe the cleaning agent away. If the door handle is made of a unique material like silver or brass, use a specialized silver or brass cleaner to clean it. Make the house smell good using scented candles, incense, or aerosol sprays. Your clients might enjoy coming home to a house that smells clean and fresh. Light some scented candles or incense to give the house a fresh energy. You could also use an aerosol spray. Just remove the cap, point the actuator away from you, and press the spray button for one or two seconds. Before using a scented product, ask the client if they would like a scent used in their home. If they do, ask them if they have a favorite scent or if there are any scents you should avoid due to allergies or sensitivities. Try to find a product that matches your client\u2019s preferences. If they don\u2019t have a preference, go for popular scents like lemon or pine.",
