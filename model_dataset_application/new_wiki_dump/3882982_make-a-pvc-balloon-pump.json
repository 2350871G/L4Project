Adjust the blades just halfway of the sides of the pipe. Start the cutter and cut the marks. Use your left hand to rotate the pipe and your right hand to hold the pipe as a help for the clamp. Get 2 pieces of #219 O-rings and insert it onto the cut marks. Get a 1\" plug and insert it into the pipe (where two o-rings are located) with PVC glue."
