Pick a spot that\u2019s away from your house and anything else that could easily catch fire.

If you use fiber-reinforced concrete mix, it will be just fine to pour the concrete on bare dirt. Let the concrete dry thoroughly before continuing. This will take 3 to 5 days, typically."

Leave a bit more space if you want to make the barbecue area smaller than this. The interior of the grill will need to be just a little bigger than the grill surface that you bought.

You can use concrete blocks instead of bricks, if you wish. You will probably lay fewer courses, since standard blocks are taller than bricks."

Check to make sure that everything looks straight. You can use concrete blocks instead of bricks, if you wish. You will probably lay fewer courses, since standard blocks are taller than bricks. Laying the Courses Prepare your mortar mix. You\u2019ll need to have this ready to start laying bricks. Follow the instructions on the mix package, and keep the prepared mortar near your work area so it\u2019s easy to reach. Use bonding cement (prepared to package instructions) rather than mortar if you are making a grill from concrete blocks. Start laying bricks  at the corners.

After you have the barbecue base, you\u2019ll need to build it up higher to provide a place for the charcoal and grill surface to rest. Continue laying courses of bricks, but only on three sides. That way, you\u2019ll be able to access the charcoal and grill surface from the open front side. Insert rebar to support the charcoal pan. When you reach about four courses above the base, insert 4 inch (10.2 cm) (100 mm) lengths of steel rebar into the mortar between one course of bricks and the next. The rebar should jut out just a bit into the interior, open space of the grill area. Use a level to check and make sure each course of bricks is level as you lay it. Alternatively, you can lay one course of bricks sideways to provide a support surface for the charcoal pan. Add supports for the grill surface. Lay a couple more courses of bricks, and then insert more short pieces of rebar (or bricks laid sideways). This will provide a nice, sturdy support for the grill surface, slightly above the charcoal pan. Top off the grill walls. Add at least a couple more courses to your grill walls. When it has reached a height that you like, place solid bricks on the top row. This will give the grill a finished look. Surround the grill with more bricks (optional).
