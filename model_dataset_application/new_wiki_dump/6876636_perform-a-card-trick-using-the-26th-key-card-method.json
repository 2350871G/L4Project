  "text":" Setting Up the Trick Get a complete pack of 52 playing cards. With the cards shuffled and placed face down, count down until you reach the 26th card. You should memorise this card as it is your key card. To make this easier you may want to replace the existing 26th card with one that you will find it easier to remember \u2013 for instance an Ace. Turn the cards face up and fan them for your spectator and get them to confirm it is an ordinary, mixed-up, pack of cards.  Place the deck of cards face down to your spectator\u2019s right. We shall name this Packet A. Ask your spectator to cut the cards roughly two thirds down. Place these cards to the left of Packet A. We will call this pile Packet B. Ask the spectator to cut Packet B roughly in half and place the cut cards to the left of Packet B. This pile becomes Packet C. (You will note that your key card should now be sitting somewhere around the middle of Packet B.) Ask your spectator to pick up Packet C and shuffle the cards. Ask that they look at, and remember the top card (without showing you) and replace the card on top of the packet. Then they should place Packet C back in its original position. Ask the spectator to pick up and shuffle Packet A. Once they have done this get them to place Packet A on Packet C. Ask the spectator to place the combined Packet A and Packet C on top of Packet B.  Ask the spectator to cut the pack placing the lower half of the cut on the top of the other half. Ask them to repeat this cut. Thank the spectator. Instruct the audience that you will attempt to locate the spectator\u2019s card. Holding the cards closely to your chest you firstly need to identify your key card. You need to find the card quickly. It will either be in the bottom half dozen or so cards or the top half dozen or so. Once located, count the cards up through the pack until you reach the 26th card. Remember to count your key card as number one. If the key card is towards the top end of the pack you should count to the top of the pack and then continue from the bottom until you reach number 26. You have now identified your spectator\u2019s card. Revealing the Card Make sure you are holding the cards above the spectator\u2019s card in your left hand and the spectator\u2019s card and all below it in your right hand. The cards should still be face up close to your chest. Say something like: \u201cI am having real trouble finding your card. I will need to try doing something else.\u201d Whilst you are saying this bring the two halves of the pack together but with the cards in the right hand going on top of those in the left. Looking at the cards face down the spectator\u2019s card is now the top one. Grip the short sides of the cards in your right hand, with your left hand underneath gripping the long sides. Your right hand should be obscuring the whole of the deck from your spectators. Using your left thumb, gently push the top card away from the rest of the pack so that it overlaps by about one inch. This move should not be visible to spectators as your right hand should cover this slight. Reveal the card. You are now ready for the reveal. You might like to ask the spectator to tell you the name of their card. As they do so you toss the pack from your right hand to your left hand. The air pressure on the overlapping card should force it to turn over.",
