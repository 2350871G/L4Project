If you want to expand later on, you won't have any problem! If this isn't your first rock rodeo, look at transforming an existing hill in your yard or even create one (known as a berm)! For beginners, try out a 5 by 10 feet (1.5 by 3.0 m) section to start with. If you intend to expand should things go well, make sure it is next to a space that can be taken up later on! Select an area that already has a grade to it to help with drainage. Especially make sure the flowerbeds between rocks will get proper drainage. Avoid working around trees if you can. Digging the flowerbeds and holes to bed the rocks into will be more difficult with root systems. This will also hurt the tree in the long run."

Whether you check online, in magazines, or visit some local gardens, take notes on what you like or want to avoid. Talk to local nurseries or gardeners who tend to rock gardens. You can pick their brains about the experience of building or maintaining the garden. This will help you figure out any pitfalls to avoid that may be specific to your local climate or soil."

Since rocks aren't the most fun to move, get the placement planned and right the first time. Simple sketches allow you to try out different placements and arrangements without committing too much more than some pencil lead. Find out about and plan around any utilities before you begin work. Call your local utility-finder or providers to have utility lines located as soon as possible before breaking ground."

Take into account your color combinations. Mix darker pebbles and stones into the areas near your lighter large rocks and boulders. If certain sections are feeling like they might be too dark, find another small, light-colored rock that has a different texture from the larger rock. Lava rock makes for a great filler between larger light-colored rocks. It drains well, and the darkness makes surround colored flowers really pop."

The idea is to place flowers that will draw you to come in closer. Small daffodils, local wildflowers, succulents, and brodiaea all make for good additions to a rock garden. Add in some mosses or short grasses around rougher rock edges to blend and soften the landscape slightly."

Dig out some of the earth for big rocks to nestle into if they aren't particularly flat. Space out your larger rocks and boulders, leaving room for smaller collections between. Avoid clumping the bigger rocks in one place, leaving the smaller ones to a side of their own. Work on smoothing out your drainage plan as you lay the rocks.

Top the base with topsoil suitable to the plants you have selected. If you are planting in the cracks and crevices of a stretch of rock, you can probably get by with just providing the sand and topsoil as a base. The rocks themselves can serve to drain some underneath. Put plants that need more watch and care in easier-to-access spaces. The succulents and hardy wildflowers that don't need maintenance will be better on slopes or hard-to-access parts of the garden."
