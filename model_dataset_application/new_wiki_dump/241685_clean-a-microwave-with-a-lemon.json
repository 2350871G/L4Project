Then, pour the water over the lemon juice and stir with a spoon to mix the liquids thoroughly. If you don't have a lemon available, you can use another citrus fruit, like a lime or an orange."

Put all of the pieces into the water, and stir the mixture with a spoon again. This will ensure that any juice still in the lemon will evaporate in the microwave to help remove dirt and debris."

          "description":"Place the bowl in the microwave uncovered, and set it on high for 3 minutes. The water should bubble and boil, and may evaporate out of the bowl. After 3 minutes, leave the door closed so the steam from the water can't escape. If there's still some water left in the bowl, microwave it for an additional 1-2 minutes until almost all of the water is evaporated."

Then, carefully open the door and remove the bowl so you can start cleaning!Warning: The bowl may be very hot when you take it out of the microwave. If it's too warm to touch, use oven mitts to safely remove it."

Set it aside and wipe the sides and ceiling of the microwave, using the water as your cleaning agent. Don't forget to wipe down inside of the door, as well! The food and markings on the inside of the microwave should wipe off easily. If you don't want to use a towel, you can use a damp sponge with a scrubbing pad to wipe the inside of the microwave. Remember to replace the turntable once the microwave is clean!"

Be sure to stir the mixture thoroughly, since vinegar can have a strong smell that may linger in your microwave. If you don't have any caked-on food in your microwave, you shouldn't need to add any vinegar to the lemon water.Tip: If it has been more than 1 month since you last cleaned your microwave, add an additional 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vinegar to the water to loosen the stains."

If the stain won't budge, you may need to use a mild abrasive. If you don't have any lemon water left, microwave a new batch for 2 minutes and let it stand for 5 minutes in the microwave. Then, use the leftover water to help remove the mark."

The baking soda will act as a gentle abrasive to chip away at baked-on food, and the lemon water will help dissolve the food as it comes off. Be sure to wipe the area clean so there's no baking soda left behind on the interior of the microwave."
