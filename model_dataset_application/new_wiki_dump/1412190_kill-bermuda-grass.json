          "description":"Before you can choke out the creeping grass, you\u2019ll need to remove as much as possible from the affected area. Grab a handful of leaves near the soil and pull them up firmly until you dislodge the underlying root system. Clearing the ground will give you a head start over new growth, making your cover more effective. Use a leaf bag or wheelbarrow to dispose of the stripped Bermuda grass to prevent spreading small pieces to other parts of your lawn. You should throw it in the trash rather than the compost in order to prevent it from spreading. If you don't want to hand pull the grass, you could try mowing the lawn very short, which will help."

          "headline":"Cover the bare patch with 2-3 layers of cardboard.",
          "description":"The cardboard acts as an insulator to keep the root system cut off from sunlight, moisture, and nutrients. For the kind of growth that pops up on most lawns, 2 stacked sheets ought to be enough. If you have a serious overgrowth problem, it may be necessary to use 3 layers. Most home improvement centers sell parcels of cut cardboard for a few dollars apiece. For a more economical alternative, look for boxes that have been thrown out or recycled. Overlap the edges of each section to keep new grass from popping up between the cardboard. If you don't have cardboard, you could use several layers of wet newspaper instead. You might also have success using landscaping fabric in place of cardboard to achieve the same effect in areas with sparse ground cover."

That way, you\u2019ll still be able to plant smaller flowers and shrubs without having to risk exposing the root system of the Bermuda grass. Once the mulch is in place, tamp it down lightly with the flat edge of a shovel or trowel to compact it. Any conventional gardening mulch will do, or go with an all-organic mixture of arborist\u2019s waste and compost."

Doing away with the bulk of the grass slows its growth considerably, giving the landscaping fabric the time it needs to be effective. Shorter grass is less likely to cause uneven bunching beneath the fabric, as well."

Landscaping fabric is the best ground cover option for broad areas where Bermuda grass is coming in thick. Cut the sheet as needed to fit better over narrow or oddly-shaped areas. Be careful not to tear, wrinkle, or damage the landscaping fabric in any way while you're handling it."

If you think you might want to add new plants in the future, wait until you're actually ready to plant to make holes for them. This reduces the number of places where new grass might come up. Don't make the holes any bigger than they need to be to fit around your plants. If you do, you may soon discover that new Bermuda grass has sprouted in the intervening space. Only cut holes for shrubs and other perennials. Caring for annuals forces you to remove the landscaping fabric too frequently."

In the meantime, keep an eye on the edges and openings to make sure no new grass has found its way through. Strip any stray leaves you happen to come across manually. Landscaping fabric is a quicker alternative to cardboard-and-mulch ground cover. However, it can create more opportunities for stubborn grass to continue spreading if not correctly installed and maintained. You should not plant a lawn over landscaping fabric."

This is desirable because chemical herbicides are often absorbed through the leaves rather than the roots.

Look for Bermuda grass to dry out and begin turning brown as it dies. Be sure to survey other places nearby where Bermuda grass may be growing unseen.
