Then, measure out \u20442 cup (120 mL) of water and pour it over the glue in the bowl. Stir the 2 ingredients thoroughly with a spoon until they're fully mixed together. Most bottles of school glue contain 4 ounces (120 mL), which amounts to \u20442 cup (120 mL). If your glue says 4 ounces on the packaging, you can just empty out the whole bottle into the bowl! You can double the recipe and use 1 cup (240 mL) of clear glue and 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Do not use white school glue! Using clear PVA glue is the key to making this slime clear."

Your slime will still be see-through if you add food coloring, but it won't be crystal clear. If you want this, stir in 1-3 drops of blue food coloring with a spoon. If you don't have blue food coloring on hand, then try 1-3 drops of liquid watercolor paint instead. Don't use acrylic paint, because you'll end up with slime that isn't see-through.Tip: Experiment with combinations to create custom colors for your slime! For example, you could add 1 drop of green food coloring and 2 drops of blue food coloring to create a pretty teal color."

Use a spoon to stir in 1/4 teaspoon (1.4 g) of Borax powder. Mix them together until the Borax completely dissolves. Be sure to use warm water! If you use room temperature water, the Borax won't dissolve. If you're doubling the recipe, use 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water and 1/2 teaspoon (2.8 g) of Borax powder. Keep in mind that Borax can cause skin, eye, and lung irritation. Handle the concentrated powder carefully and keep it out of the reach of small children."
