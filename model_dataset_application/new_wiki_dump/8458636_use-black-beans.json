          "description":"After cooking your black beans, combine them with equal parts corn (canned or cut right off the cob) and freshly diced tomatoes, red onion and cilantro. Pour in a splash of red wine vinegar and savor with tortilla chips, pita bread or on top of a mound of melty nachos. Preparing corn and black bean salsa only requires a handful of ingredients and takes practically no time at all, making it perfect for easy dinners and last-minute potluck events. Finish your salsa with other zesty additives like cubed mango or fresh jalapeno peppers."

          "description":"For a more heart-healthy take on a classic, use black beans in place of refried beans in a hot or chilled bean dip. They cook, mash and eat the same way, but contain less fat and starch and more protein and beneficial vitamins than other varieties of beans. Top with a handful of crumbled cotija or shredded asadero cheese, or even a dollop of Greek yogurt and some fresh herbs. Put cooked black beans through the blender or food processor for a few seconds before adding your other ingredients to ensure that they're the right consistency. Blend black beans with chickpeas, garlic and lemon for a unique take on hummus."

Whether you\u2019re whipping up a quiche for an afternoon luncheon or providing a more interesting alternative to the usual finger foods at a Super Bowl party, it doesn\u2019t take much more for these vegetables to shine. They're well suited for both hot and cold offerings, as well, giving you even more options to experiment with. Spinach and black bean recipes often benefit from the addition of a little creaminess from ricotta or mozzarella cheese. It doesn\u2019t get much easier than taking a can of black beans and a package of frozen spinach and transforming them into a delicious starter."

          "description":"If you prefer to keep things simple, just drain and heat a can of black beans, sprinkle with salt and dig in. You can also serve them alongside seasoned Mexican rice for more of a traditional approach. Black beans are both flavorful and nutritious, meaning you can never eat too many of them. For additional flavor, enhance basic black beans with diced cilantro, cayenne pepper, a spritz of lime juice or even a few sections of avocado. Black beans and rice makes a quick and easy go-to side dish for nearly any Tex-Mex recipe."

          "description":"Black beans make a wonderful addition to nearly any salad, as they highlight but don\u2019t interfere with the delicate notes of other ingredients. As an added bonus, they tend to absorb vinaigrettes and seasonings once they've been dressed, becoming bite-sized bursts of flavor. Try them in a Southwest-style chopped or Cobb salad, or in more contemporary concoctions such as chilled cucumber and feta or arugula salad with pickled radish. Black beans can readily serve as the protein source that\u2019s missing from most salads. When tossed and portioned in advance, salads make a complete and convenient meal that you can take with you to the office, gym or lunchroom at school."

Season drained, pre-cooked black beans with olive oil, sea salt, cracked black pepper and other spices and stick them in the oven for half an hour at 400 degrees, then nibble on them throughout the day to keep your energy up. When properly cooked, roasted black beans should have a tender, slightly crispy bite. Garlic salt, red pepper flakes, cayenne or chili powder can lend roasted black beans a more intense finish."

Add them straight to a hot pan coated with oil or butter. Saut\u00e9ed herbs and spices can set the stage for complex flavors like lamb and fish, or put the finishing touches on them when layered over top. Try sun-drying or pickling an unused can of black beans for an at-home culinary project that you can then apply to all sorts of unique saut\u00e9 dishes."

If you don\u2019t know, however, or you need to be reminded, make room for a heaping serving of black beans the next time you have a burrito, tostada or quesadilla. The chemistry between the beans and the zesty veggies and gooey cheese is undeniable. For vegetarians and vegans (or quick dinners), try swapping out the usual meats for black beans in tacos or enchiladas.

The presentation of the dish will benefit from the mixture of colors, while you'll benefit from the added nutritive value. Black beans can also come in handy when you find yourself one can short of white or red beans before dinnertime. Your heart and waistline will benefit, as well, since black beans are among the best you can choose. These types of foods store well, making them great comfort food during the long winter months."

No matter what else you put in your omelette, you can chow down without guilt knowing that you\u2019re nourishing your body. Simply drop in a small handful of cooked black beans (make sure they\u2019re completely drained) before the eggs have begun to set up.

When ground and molded into patties, black beans have a firm, meaty consistency and hold seasonings well. Bean burgers can even be tossed on the grill to seal in that charbroiled taste that true burger lovers couldn\u2019t bear to go without. Breadcrumbs can be used to bind black bean burger patties, giving them a richer texture and preventing them from crumbling when cooked. Pile on leaf lettuce, juicy ripe tomato slices and Vidalia onion rings for that timeless burger presentation, or get creative with your toppings using ingredients like cool cucumber relish, pickled sweet peppers and dill."
