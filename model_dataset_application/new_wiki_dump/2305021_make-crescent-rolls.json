Allow it to sit out at room temperature for 10 minutes, just long enough to soften and become easier to work with. Forming Crescent Rolls Cut both dough rectangles in half. You should be left with four rough squares of dough. Work with one square at a time. Form the square of dough into a rough circle. Use your hands to round the corners, forming a circle that is about 9 in. (22.86 cm) in diameter. Use a pizza cutter to slice the dough. You should form about six wedges or triangular slices from the circle. Form crescents. Start from the broad end of the dough and roll the wedge along its length, toward the top point. Bend the new corners of the roll inward, forming a slight crescent. Repeat the shaping process with the remaining dough. Form the remaining squares into circles, cut the circles into six wedges, and roll each wedge into a crescent shape. Place the rolls on a baking sheet. The baking sheet should be lightly greased or covered with aluminum foil, wax paper, or parchment paper. Place the rolls on the pan so that the tip is tucked beneath the rest of the roll.
