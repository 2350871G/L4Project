The water should get cloudy, so pour off the cloudy water. Refill the bowl with water. Continue rinsing the rice until the water is clear. Washing the rice removes surface starches and any debris."

Soaking the rice helps the grains expand and be fluffy. You can soak the rice in the water you plan on boiling it in. If you do this, then the amount of water you need to use is 1.25 times the amount of rice. For 2 cups of rice, use 2 1/2 cups of water."
