          "description":"Some herbs are harvested not just for their leaves but also their seeds and/or flowers. You will need to adjust when you harvest depending on what part of the herb you want. For example, cilantro's coriander (that is, the \"fruit\" or seed portion of the plant) only becomes available after the flowers form seed pods, but by then it will have very few leaves. If you're growing for seeds (ex: dill, fennel, coriander, or caraway) harvest around the time the seed pods change color. If you\u2019re growing for leaves, harvest before the plant starts to bloom. Some herbs like basil take on a bitter taste once they begin to flower. For the flowers of herbs like lavender, borage, and chamomile, harvest before the flowers fully open. Wait until the end of summer or early fall to uproot plants like ginseng and goldenseal."

          "description":"If your plant is looking damaged, overgrown, or diseased, do not attempt to harvest from it. The likelihood that you will end up with a subpar product that tastes off or will mold is significantly higher. Instead, prune and care for your herbs until they are back in good health and harvest them after they have had sufficient time to recover their growth."

In order to ensure that your herbs will taste right, harvest before they start to flower. Timing can be key: oregano, thyme, and mint become their most flavorful just before they begin to bloom."
        },

          "headline":"Harvest by age.",
          "description":"Some herbs are very predictable for the earliest time you can start harvesting. However, it may depend on whether or not you've planted them as seeds or if you transplanted them. Use the following as guidelines for harvesting common herbs:\nParsley: 70-90 days after planting\nRosemary: 6 weeks after planting\nSage: 75 days after transplanting\nLemon balm, peppermint (and mint), tarragon, and thyme can be harvested at any time once the herb has sprouted and leaves appear. Use your own judgment, too. It\u2019s best to harvest based on how the plant looks \u2013 and whether it seems ready \u2013 rather than on days."

          "headline":"Harvest by height.",
          "description":"It can be difficult to tell exactly when your herbs may bloom because herbs' growth cycles can be impeded or encouraged by the weather. Additionally, maturity varies from plant to plant. One accurate way to be sure you can start harvesting your herbs is to measure their height. If your herbs meet the minimum requirement listed below, you can start harvesting:\nBasil: 6-8\" tall\nCilantro: 6-12\" long\nOregano: 3-4\" tall"

Logically you should pick your herbs when they have the highest concentration of oil. This happens to be in the early morning hours, around the time the morning dew is evaporating. Be sure that you pick your herbs before the heat of the day sets in. The sun's heat will dry up the plants, reducing the amount of oil. Do not wash the dew from the leaves or you will lose the herbs' fragrant oils."

However, perennial herbs (that is, herbs that live for three or more growing years) should not be harvested after August so that you don't accidentally encourage the plant to grow when it is too cold for it to survive."

You may also want to wear gloves to keep your hands from getting dirty and to protect them from any potential pests. Clean your harvesting tools with rubbing alcohol between plants, too, to reduce the risk of spreading diseases."

In order to be sure that you don't accidentally kill your herbs, don't harvest more than \u2153 of the plant that you can see. For harvesting leaves, you'll want to snip (from a mature plant) a few inches down the stem. You can also simply pick off the few pieces that you need when you need them, but clipping them will stimulate better growth afterward. The most tender leaves, ideal for salads and dressings, are located at the top of the plant. Older, more flavorful leaves are good for cooking recipes and will be located at the bottom of the plant."

          "description":"While you are harvesting, look for yellowed and dying leaves as well as flower buds. Removing these unwanted items encourages better, faster leaf growth, and in the case of the latter it helps to keep the leaves more tender. Let one plant go to seed (that is, do not weed or prune it away and allow nature to do the work of reseeding for you) from your stock in order to have seeds for the next year's crop."

In the case of parsley, you\u2019ll need to clip them from the ground. Otherwise, the plant will not send up new shoots to replace the old ones. For other plants, however, you\u2019ll want to leave some of the stalk intact. For chives, leave 2 to 3 inches when you harvest to support new growth."

You will need to use a shovel or digging fork to get the roots out. Be forewarned: some roots can be very deep and very large depending on the plant; burdock, for example, can have roots that grow up to 12 inches in length and 1 inch thick."

          "description":"If you intend to use your freshly picked herbs for cooking, you will want to remove them from the stem by sliding a thumb and your forefinger from top to bottom, pulling them off as you go. If you intend to use them for their fragrance or preserve them for later, leave your herbs' leaves and/or flowers on the stem. If the herb will simply be used for flavoring in the cooking but will not be eaten, it's okay to cook the entire stem with the leaf to make it easier to remove the item when you're finished. For example, bay leaves are commonly used for seasoning soups, chilis, and other savory foods, but they are never eaten, so you might find it easier to leave them on the stem for removal. If the leaves will not come off easily, such as with parsley and bay leaves, you can use a pair of scissors to snip them off."

Herbs that are left sitting for a day or more may end up with bruised leaves and begin to deteriorate. This will result in a loss of aromatic and flavorful oil.

For plants that have recently seen rain, brushing them off with a dampened cloth should be sufficient. If your plant is dusty, rinse it in cool tap water and then get rid of the excess by using a salad spinner. Gently pat the herbs dry with a towel to finish. If you can avoid washing the herbs, do so, as this will slow down the preservation process. However, if you live in a region that is particularly dusty due to drought or the natural environment (say a desert or near the beach), you may have no choice.

Preheat the dehydrator to 95-115 degrees Fahrenheit and place your herbs in a single layer on a provided tray, removing larger leaves from thick stems.Periodically check on your herbs for dryness, and expect that it will take between 1-4 hours for your herbs to fully dry depending on how much moisture the leaves had to begin with. Herb leaves will crumble when dry, but roots will become even harder than before."

Tie the bundle together tightly with a rubber band or twist tie, and then hang the bundles upside down in an area away from direct sunlight (to avoid bleaching)."

Collect all of the herbs you wish to dry in an oven-safe tray and place that in the oven. Set your oven's temperature to 200 degrees Fahrenheit and when it's heated to the appropriate temperature, turn it off.

Be sure they're really thoroughly dry by putting them in a jar, closing the lid, and leaving them on a countertop for a day or two.
