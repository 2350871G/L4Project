This basic nacho dip recipe calls for 1 package of cream cheese, 1-2 cups of sour cream, 1 jar of salsa, 1 large tomato, onion, and green bell pepper (to suit tastes), and about a cup of freshly shredded cheese. Dice and mix the vegetables together, then set them aside so they\u2019ll be ready to add in later. To make the recipe big enough to fill up a crowd, simply double the amounts of the primary ingredients."

          "description":"Allow the package of cream cheese to soften and come to room temperature. This will promote spreadability and allow it to mix with the thinner sour cream. Drain any separated liquid from the cream cheese container. Most culinary guidelines will tell you to leave a package of cream cheese out overnight in order to soften in, but the process can be sped up considerably by first cutting the cream cheese into small cubes."

          "description":"Combine the whole package of cream cheese with 1 cup of sour cream in a large mixing bowl. Mix the two thoroughly using an electric beater or spatula. Continue mixing until the consistency is the same throughout. The cream cheese and sour cream together will provide the creamy base for the dip. Start with one cup of sour cream. If the mixture is still too thick to easily blend, increase the amount of sour cream up to one additional cup. Remember, the dip will thicken once it\u2019s refrigerated. If you\u2019re mixing the cream cheese and sour cream by hand, use scooping circular motions with the spatula to \u201cfold\u201d the mixture in on itself."

Make sure not to add too much at once, as this can overpower the dairy elements and reduce the creaminess of the dip. Choose a thick salsa instead of thinner types like pico de gallo to avoid making the dip watery. Just to be on the safe side, use mild salsa.

Rotel contains tomatoes and mild green chiles, making it perfect for Mexican and Southwest-inspired dishes and dips. You can even mix and match, if you prefer, using Rotel in place of the tomatoes and green bell pepper while adding fresh onion and whatever other veggies you desire. Drain the Rotel can of all excess liquid before adding it to your dip."

          "description":"While most cream cheese-based dips are made to be served at cool temperatures, you can also modify the cooking process to make a hot, delicious and extra creamy dip. This will require you to heat the cream cheese/sour cream mixture slowly, while gradually adding the other ingredients. Cut the cream cheese into small cubes before combining it with the other ingredients and bake the dip in a casserole dish at a low heat to prevent the cream cheese from scorching or clumping. When you\u2019re ready to serve, sprinkle a little more shredded cheese over the top for a nice melted finished. Cream cheese is excellent for making rich, creamy sauces and dips, but it has to be heated correctly. Soften the cream cheese to room temperature first, then melt it over low heat gradually. Add a few ounces of milk if the cream cheese looks like it\u2019s curdling or getting thick. Smooth, easily-melted cheeses and cheese products like Velveeta will work well for hot dips."
