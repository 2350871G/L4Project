          "description":"For a baking station, having the work area below counter height can be helpful, as it can help you get the right leverage when rolling and cutting baked goods. If you can't have a lower work area, try adding a small, sturdy step stool to the area, so you can raise yourself higher. Generally, a good height is between 30 inches and 36 inches from the floor, though it may differ depending on how tall you are."

If that option is too expensive, consider adding other options, such as a mat designed for rolling out baked goods. Marble is a good choice because it is a hard surface, good for rolling. It's also very cleanable, and it stays cool, which is good for working with doughs."

While some things, such as ingredient canisters, can stay on the counter, you don't want everything out on the counter. Dedicate some cabinet space to your baking station."

This type of cart can be tucked out of the way when you're not using it, making it convenient."

That way, you're not wasting time digging them out every time you want to bake. You'll need things like spoons for stirring, spatulas for removing cookies, and rolling pins for rolling out dough.

Some kitchens use sliding floors in cabinets, making it easy to slide them away when not in use. Others have lifts that extend from lower cabinets.
