  "text":" Prepare the Wood With a saw, cut wood to desired size. The block should be smaller then the paper being used by an inch on all sides. Save scrap pieces to practice carving on. Look at both sides of the wood and pick the smoother side or the nicer grain to be carved. Smooth out any small imperfections with sandpaper. Paint India ink on the side to be carved and let the block dry.  Transfer the design. Rub chalk onto the back of the paper with the design. Lay the paper chalk side down on the block. Trace the design. The design will be reversed on the final print so any writing needs to be traced and carved backwards in order for it to appear correctly in the print. Option 1: If the design is printed off a computer, select a mirror image printout. Option 2: Put the design on tracing paper. Rub chalk in the front of the design. This now reverses the image so the print will be the same as the original design. Carving Before carving the block, practice carving on a scrap piece of wood. The V gouge is used to make lines. The greater the pressure applied, the wider and deeper the line formed.The U gouge is used for removing large areas of wood. Hold the gouge in one hand. Place palm around the curved part of the handle with fingers under it and thumb out over the blade. Keep the base of second hand on the wood and finger on top of the hand with the gouge. This gives better control over the gouge. Lightly push the gouge into the wood at an angle. Keep the hand away from the front of the gouge in case the gouge slips. Reduce the angle and apply a forward force. This will carve out a straight line. At the end of the line, pull the gouge back out. Push the edge of the gouge straight into the end point to make a clean break on the wood. Carving with the wood grain is easier than carving against it. When carving out large areas, use the V gouge to outline the area then use the U gouge to carve that area out.  If there is a mistake, use wood glue to glue big pieces back in or use wood putty to patch small bits.  Doing a Proof When carving the block is completed, do a proof. A proof is quick print to check the block. Clean the workspace before starting. Mix woodblock ink with woodblock retarder. Knead them together on a piece of glass with a putty or palette knife. Use a ratio of \u00bc retarder to \u00be ink. This will vary with each brand of ink. The amount of ink to use will depend on the size of the block. Roll the ink. Run the rubber roller back and forth until the roller is evenly covered with ink. When the ink starts to form little points and makes a cracking noise, the right amount of ink is on the roller. Roll ink onto the carved block until there is an even coating of ink.  Place newspaper or computer paper onto the block.  Rub (burnish) the back of the paper. Using a wooden spoon, make small circles over the surface. The harder the rub, the greater the ink transfer and the darker that part of the image will look. This method makes contrast in the print. Carefully remove the paper from the block once the whole block has been rubbed. If the paper print sticks to the block, the ink is drying too fast. The ink needs more ink retarder to slow down the ink from drying. Set the paper aside to dry and wash the ink off of the block.  Examine the proof. Change anything you do not like about the print. Check to make sure all the lines printed. If the lines did not print, they will need to be re-carved. Verify the new re-carved lines with another proof. Signing the Prints Allow the prints to dry before signing them. Prints should be signed in PENCIL. Place the name under the bottom right corner.  The title of the print is positioned in the middle of the bottom edge.  Under the bottom left corner is the edition number. This is written as a fraction. The top number is the order in which the print was done. The bottom number is the total number of prints printed in the series. Now that the prints are signed, they are ready to mat and display. ",
