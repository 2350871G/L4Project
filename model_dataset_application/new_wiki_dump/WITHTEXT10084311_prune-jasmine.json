          "description":"Give summer jasmine a hard prune annually, in late summer or early autumn. Winter jasmine needs a heavy prune in late spring, immediately after it has finished blooming. Winter jasmine blooms from June to October in the Southern Hemisphere, and from March to April in the Northern Hemisphere. Summer jasmine blooms from April through June in the Northern Hemisphere, and from November through January in the Southern Hemisphere. Flowers form on the previous year's growth. Pruning immediately after flowering gives that growth time to mature so your plant can flower fully next season."

If your jasmine is thick, start at the bottom and work up a single stem, clearing excessive growth as you go. Then move to the next stem. If the vines are tangled, cut away the smaller branches to reveal the main vine. Then you can separate it from others and retrain it."

Remove dead or damaged leaves entirely from their stems, but leave the vertical vine if it remains healthy. Once every other year, identify weaker vines that are thin with fewer blooms. Cut them down to ground level as well. This will encourage the plant to grow stronger vines. Aim to cut back no more than \u2153 of the total vines."

Remove weaker stems from the new growth to allow air and light to reach into the vine. This also ensures your vines don't get so heavy that they damage their supports or cause them to collapse. Branches that cross other branches will rub against each other and damage each other. Remove the branch that isn't growing in the right direction relative to your supports and the way you've trained the vines.

If you don't want to cut these vines away, twist them gently into the right direction and tie them with twine.

Allow the plant to grow until its roots fill the starter or seedling pot, then move outside in early spring. Leave the vines trained around the bamboo canes when you move your jasmine outdoors. When you plant your jasmine, set it out 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) from the supports to make sure the roots of the plant will be exposed to adequate rainfall.
