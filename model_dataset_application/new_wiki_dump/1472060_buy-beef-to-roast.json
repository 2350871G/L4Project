          "description":"These are all in the front and hind legs along the top portion of the animal. Cuts of roast from these areas are more tender and flavorful than other cuts and tend to roast well. Conversely, pieces of meat that have connective tissue or little marbling don't generally roast well. Rib, top sirloin, tri-tip, and tenderloin all make excellent roast choices. Beef tenderloin comes from directly under the spine, which is the least worked muscle on the animal's body and thus the tenderest. Most people choose this cut of beef over any other, although it has less flavor than a rib roast. Avoid cuts of meat from the regions that get the most exercise, such as the rear legs. These are cheaper but lower in quality. Determine meat tenderness by gently pressing each prospective piece with your fingers. If it's soft to the touch and contains fewer muscles groups within each cut, it's a tender cut. You can also look for a fine meat grain."

          "description":"Visible fat is also known as marbling. In addition to its connection to flavor, more marbling is conductive to roasting. Conversely, leaner cuts tend to have a blander taste. For a nice balance of even roasting and juicy flavor, choose cuts with some marbling, but not so much that they're riddled with fat. Strip-loin or ribeye typically have a great balance of tenderness and flavor. If you prefer tender roasts, go with filet mignon."

          "description":"When butchers cut rib roasts, they do so into 2 pieces: the first cut and the second cut. The former is cut from the ribs closest to the short loin, which is leaner and contains more of the rib-eye muscle. Identify first cut ribs by their longer rib length. First cut beef is also referred to as the small end."

          "description":"The second cut comes from the ribs closest to the shoulder. Some people find that the second cut is more flavorful because it has more of the fat-marbled layer located on the edge of the roast. Second cut ribs are shorter than first cut pieces. The second cut is also known as the large end."

          "description":"Roasts come in a variety of sizes. A good rule of thumb is boneless roasts will yield two 6 ounce (170 g) servings per 1 pound (450 g) of cooked meat. A bone-in roast will yield between one to one-and-a-half 6 ounce (170 g) servings per 1 pound (450 g) of cooked roast, so select your roast size accordingly. If you're buying a rib roast, a good gauge is 2 people per bone. This is a fairly generous estimate that often allows for leftovers."

Organic cattle must be raised without hormones or antibiotics and must be fed a 100 percent organic diet. Avoid conventional supermarket beef, which often comes from mass-raised cattle that may have been injected with hormones and antibiotics. Try not to use grass-fed beef for roasting\u2014its low fat levels make it susceptible to overcooking.
