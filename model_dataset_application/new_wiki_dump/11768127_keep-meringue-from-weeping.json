Once you crack the eggs and separate the egg whites, let the egg whites sit out for a few minutes so they become room temperature. This will create the best consistency in the meringue. You can also remove the refrigerated eggs from the fridge and let them sit out for 30 minutes before separating the egg whites."

If you can, this means the sugar isn\u2019t completely dissolved and needs to be whipped more before it's finished. Adding the sugar gradually will help it dissolve more thoroughly."

If you don\u2019t have a mixer, stir the ingredients together by hand using a large mixing spoon, stirring quickly to imitate a high speed. You\u2019ll know the meringue is done mixing when you scoop it up and it forms stiff peaks."

          "description":"Cornstarch helps the meringue keep its shape, making it a good ingredient addition if you\u2019re worried about your meringue weeping. Add about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of cornstarch into the meringue as you\u2019re whipping it so it will absorb some of the extra moisture. If you're making more than one batch of meringue, add more cornstarch to balance it out."

          "headline":"Avoid overbaking your meringue so the egg whites don\u2019t shrink.",
          "description":"When the egg whites in your meringue shrink, they release more moisture and cause the meringue to sweat. Check on your meringue throughout the baking process to be sure you take it out when it\u2019s done instead of leaving it in to cook for too long. If you're baking meringue cookies, a good way to figure out if they're done is to see if they can be lifted off of the baking sheet easily and have a bottom that's cooked."
