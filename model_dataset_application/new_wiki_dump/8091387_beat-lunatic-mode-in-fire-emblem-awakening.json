The Golden Gaffe features several enemies holding 1,000, 3,000, 5,000 or 7,000 Gold depending on their power levels. Defeating them will give you that Gold, so with enough units, you can earn a large amount of gold to buy new weapons, staves, seals and so on. Keep in mind that the Outrealm Gate menu cannot be accessed until after Chapter 3, so you're on your own in Lunatic mode until then. Explore Exponential Growth. This features a bunch of Entombed who will run for the exit on the other side of the map, and won't ever attack you. They give out a lot of EXP when killed, making them a good grinding source. However, there are only four turns maximum each time you play this map, and you'll have to waste a turn running up to the Entombed, so grinding off this map may take a while. Additionally, watch out for the Entombed with 65 HP, as they have Counter in their skillset. Earn weapons in the last DLC map in the bundle, Infinite Regalia. It features several units wielding weapons that were in previous games in the Fire Emblem series, and you can earn these weapons by getting them through chests in the back of the map. These weapons include Armads, G\u00e1e Bolg, Luna and so on. Be careful, though: the enemies on this map will actively attack you if you are in their range unlike the Golden Gaffe and Exponential Growth. Check out the Bonus Box in the Wireless feature on the menu when you're in the World Map once it's been unlocked. Through this, you can obtain items from other games (such as the ones listed above), recruit units from past games, add Paralogues to the map to recruit units and more. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/e\\/eb\\/Bonus-Box.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/e\\/eb\\/Bonus-Box.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":276,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":456,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>Details: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external free\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/lparchive.org\\/Fire-Emblem-Awakening\\/Update%2093\\/\\\">http:\\/\\/lparchive.org\\/Fire-Emblem-Awakening\\/Update%2093\\/<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\nIf you're really stuck on a chapter and need a new item or unit, then this menu can be very useful. You can get the items for free, and recruit units from past games by either buying them with Gold or fighting them and defeating them.",
