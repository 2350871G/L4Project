  "text":" Drawing parallel lines horizontally Place hand on centre of the roller and with other hand draw horizontal line. The numbered markings seen in the window of the ruler are 1 centimeter (0.4 in). apart. Roll down the ruler to required distance and draw next line.  Drawing parallel lines vertically See the holes in front of the ruler.  Put pencil/pen in any one of the holes and with other hand on the centre of the roll ruler up or down. For lines 1 centimeter (0.4 in). apart the is no need to lift the ruler. To achieve lines closer than 1 centimeter (0.4 in). apart, shift ruler sideways to desired distance. Drawing circles, curves and arcs Put pencil/pen in the hole to the extreme left or right to act as pivot point.  Select radius distance required.  Now turn the second pencil/pen to make circle/curve/arc.  Drawing angles Place 0\u00b0/0\u00b0 line of protractor on horizontal line drawn and put mark in the hole on 0\u00b0-0\u00b0 line and then mark desired angle in semi-circular space of the ruler.  Line up the marks with ruler and draw desired angle. Ruler can be rolled parallel to the angle drawn to achieve same angle many times.",
