          "description":"Bagged vacuums are often better for people with asthma, as well as environmental allergies. This is because many modern vacuum bags are made from HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) material, which traps dust and dirt. Most bagless vacuums come with HEPA filters as well. But adding the extra layer of protection in a bagged vacuum may be better for those who have severe health problems stemming from exposure to dust and dirt. A full vacuum bag will release much less dust into the air when you throw it out than a full bagless vacuum canister will when you empty it. Some vacuum bags are made with rubber seals that release almost no particulate matter at all when you remove them from the vacuum, making them ideal for asthma and allergy sufferers.
