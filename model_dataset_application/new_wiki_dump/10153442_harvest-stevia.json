Stevia leaves become sweeter into autumn as temperatures drop and daylight hours decrease. You can help your plants gain sweetness by shielding them from too much cold during early frosts. There are a variety of ways to shield plants from the cold. Use mulch and insulating straw built up around the bases of the plants. Use a lightweight blanketing material (available from most gardening stores) over the tops of the plants. Use a polyurethane or glass cold frame. If you planted your stevia in containers, simply move your plants indoors during colder spells!"
