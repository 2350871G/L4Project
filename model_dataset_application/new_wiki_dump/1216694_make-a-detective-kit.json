For an old man disguise, try suspenders and high pants. If you want to go incognito as a fireman, get a yellow raincoat and black boots. Finally, your disguises will all need accessories.

Make sure you keep your fingerprinting stuff together in case of emergency! You\u2019ll need flour or baby powder to dust for prints. Dusting is easy--just gently sprinkle a little bit of flour or powder on the suspicious area, and then blow off any extra powder. Once you\u2019ve dusted, use a makeup brush or a paintbrush to gently brush away the powder until you can see a fingerprint. Finally, take a piece of clear tape and press it down onto the print. When you peel it off, you\u2019ll have a perfect fingerprint on the tape that you can study later. If you aren\u2019t allowed to put flour or powder on things, you can use the tape to collect fingerprints from people you know--just have them press their fingertip onto the sticky side of the tape. Keep the tape in your detective notebook so you have a file on everyone\u2019s prints!"

Start by getting a few plastic baggies to hold your evidence. Gloves will protect you from getting fingerprints on the evidence. A tape measure will help you measure the length of hairs or footprints you find. Tweezers can be used to pick up tiny pieces of evidence, like hair or an earring. A magnifying glass can help you see even the tiniest evidence, like dust or dirt. If you don\u2019t have a magnifying glass, don\u2019t worry--you can still be a detective without it.
