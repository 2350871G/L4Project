Try everything on, if it still fits and you just don't wear it that often, you may be able to style if differently. If you feel something is childish or that you're now too grown up for it, donate it to charity or, consider repurposing."

      "description":"Kids clothes don't account for busts, hips and broad shoulders. You might have a larger waist size than a kid your height. Whatever your age, you may be longer in the body or legs than a typical child your size or height. Know your measurements and what looks good on you. Children's clothes are often labeled for heights, e.g., \"for up to 140cm\". If you know how tall you are and your other measurements, you can save time not even trying on things that aren't going to fit. If adult miniskirts and short-shorts, swamp you, these are the types of clothing you can look for in children's sizes. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9f\\/Dress-and-Look-Fashionable-when-You-Still-Wear-Kid%27s-Sizes-Step-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Dress-and-Look-Fashionable-when-You-Still-Wear-Kid%27s-Sizes-Step-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/9f\\/Dress-and-Look-Fashionable-when-You-Still-Wear-Kid%27s-Sizes-Step-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Dress-and-Look-Fashionable-when-You-Still-Wear-Kid%27s-Sizes-Step-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

If you don't want to look girly, boys clothes may be a better option as they won't be emblazoned with childish glitter or lurid pink. Anyone looking for pastel colors shouldn't over look clothing aimed at girls. Boys clothing is typically primary colors. If you're a slim guy who looks great in lemo-yellow, don't be put off buying a plain tee shirt in this color from the girls section - cut the label out if it bothers you. Unisex children's wear is an option for anyone it fits, look for wardrobe staples such as tee shirts, shorts, pants/trousers and sweatshirts in larger department stores and mainstream shops. There a very high chance than these items are virtually identical to adult versions and their likely made on the same production lines so if they are a better fit on you, why not wear them? It's how you style them that counts ."

If the fit of a child's dress is good on you and it's just the color you don't like, you could dye it.
