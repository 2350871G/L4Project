However, most temperatures that are above freezing and below room temperature will work fine for short-term storage. If you\u2019d like, you can use your refrigerator as a short-term storage container. However, do not store your bottles in a freezer under any circumstance.

Samuel Bogue\t\t\tWine Director & Consultant\t\t\t\tKeep champagne a little cooler than other wines. Sam Bogue, a sommelier, says: \"All wine should be stored in a cooler environment, but with champagne, it's all about the serving temperature, so it really needs to be cold. If you have a cooler portion of your fridge, you can keep it there. Make sure it's not anywhere near the point of freezing, though, or you'll end up with a ruined bottle of champagne.\""

To avoid this, place your champagne bottles in a shaded area with little to no direct sunlight or, if possible, a completely enclosed storage container with no light exposure whatsoever. If you can\u2019t find a shaded area, cover your bottles with thin, dark-colored fabric."

Look for metal or redwood champagne racks at wine shops, furniture stores, and home improvement stores. When purchasing shelving units, look for models built out of metal or redwood. Make sure the shelving material is at least 2 in (5.1 cm) thick so it can handle the weight of your bottles. Avoid free standing shelving units.

So your drinks retain their bubbly texture, try to find a room that sits at around 50% humidity. Some houses come with wine cellars that are specially designed for drinks like champagne. Look for a room that has a hard floor and sturdy, vapor-resistant insulation that is at least 1.5 in (3.8 cm) thick.
