          "description":"To make a sensory box, you'll need a container or tub where you'll be able to fill it up with a variety of items and tools for playing. Choose a container that is the right size for your group, is in good shape, and is easy to reach. The container should not have any sharp edges and should not have any holes or cracks. It should be easy to dig your hands in and explore with little to no assistance. The size of the container really depends on how many people will be playing with the sensory box. For a classroom or group of children, a big tub that stands or mini plastic pool would be great for a sensory box. Small Tupperware and plastic tubs are suitable for one or two people."

Wet textures like shaving cream, bubble foam, slime, ice, water, jello, whipped cream, and pudding are fun to squish and feel between your fingers.

It is true that sensory boxes aren't the cleanest and tidiest activity to do and will cause a few messes, however, a few easy methods can prevent a giant mess in the end. Place a mat or tablecloth underneath the sensory box to keep your surface clean. Have a broom and dustpan nearby to sweep up any fallen objects. If possible, play with sensory boxes in a sink, tub, or outdoors for quick and easy clean-up. Dollar Store shower curtains and large sheets are excellent mats to place underneath a sensory box. Provide simple sensory box rules for a large group of children. Demonstrate to children that the objects in a sensory box shouldn't be thrown around and shouldn't be tossed on the floor."

You may also store the base or filler into a plastic bag and pour it back into the sensory box another time. Note that some objects in a sensory box might spoil, melt, and rot over time. Some items can only be used once. This includes some cooked foods, ice, snow, bubble foam, and other similar items."

Some items you might want to use include: \nPlastic eggs with materials inside\nPaper for crumbling\nMini instruments (drums, cymbals, flute, etc.) Bells (desk bells, cowbells, jingle bells, handbells, etc.) Rubber bands\nBrushes\nMini pots and pans\nSqueaky toys such as rubber ducks Choose edible items for your sensory box. If you have an infant or young toddler, you probably know how much they love putting objects in their mouth and exploring what they taste like. Instead of adding items that can be a choking hazard, add textured or simple edible items and foods that can be filled inside a sensory box. Some ideas include: \nCooked pasta (e.g spaghetti, elbows, pasta bows, etc.) Dry cereal (e.g Rice Krispies, Cheerios, Fruit Loops, Lucky Charms, Cornflakes, etc.) Dry or cooked oatmeal\nMarshmallows in different sizes, colors, and flavors\nJello in different colors\nWhipped cream\nYogurt\nFresh or frozen pieces of vegetables or fruits (this may be a choking hazard for some, so keep the pieces small)\nIce cubes (this may be a choking hazard for some, so keep the cubes small)\nPudding in different flavors and colors\nEdible play-dough\nBreadcrumbs Find items that allow looking and exploring. Playing with a sensory box requires a lot of seeing and discovering. Small, plastic magnifying glasses and other similar tools can be used for further sighting. This is a great tool to consider adding if the sensory box has small objects such as rocks, marbles, or leaves. Magnifying glasses can be added inside the sensory box, or they can be placed outside on the sides of the sensory box. Creating a Sensory Box Choose your container. The most crucial and critical step in making a sensory box is finding the proper bin that will be used for playing and exploring. The size of the container really depends on how many people will use it. For example, you may want a deep, large container for a preschool classroom. If you are creating a sensory box for one person, go with bins and tubs that are small. Small dishes, plastic or paper plates, dish tubs, small cardboard boxes, Tupperware containers, and foil roasting pans are great choices if you have one person playing with the sensory box. Select a theme for your sensory box. While optional, a themed sensory box is more fun and engaging, especially if it's something children are interested in. They also bring bonus opportunities for further exploration and learning. You can make a themed sensory box based on what your child or group is interested in, or what's going on the world. For example, if winter is near, you might consider making a winter-themed sensory box. Themed sensory boxes also make it easier to select items and materials for your container. If you have a hard time finding the right items for your sensory box, a certain theme can make it a little easier. For more ideas on selecting a theme for your sensory box, scroll down to part three of this article. Add a filler or base to the container. The base of your sensory box is the material that's touched and explored the most. The substance has a texture that is fun and relaxing to touch. Textured materials like oats, rice, popcorn kernels, beads, dry pasta, and dry beans make gentle sounds when they're touched and are excellent fillers for a sensory box. Wet textures like shaving cream, bubble foam, slime, ice, water, jello, whipped cream, and pudding are fun to squish and feel between your fingers. Be creative and feel free to use what you have on hand. Most fillers and bases can be found around your house or can be found at your local Dollar Store. Throw in a variety of objects and toys. Adding toys and objects encourages pretend play and further fun to the sensory box. You can throw in a few toys based on the theme of your sensory box. For example, a pond sensory box could have rubber ducks and a farm sensory box might have plastic farm animals. Add instruments and tools for further exploring. Cups, spoons, jars, muffin trays, brushes, shovels, magnifying glasses, funnels, buckets, plastic knives, plastic scissors, mini cooking utensils, cookie cutters, and chopsticks are excellent tools that allow others to explore and discover sensory boxes even deeper. Different tools and instruments increase the level of play in a sensory box and are great to consider if your child doesn't enjoy touching different textures with their bare hands. Extra tools and instruments can increase a child's motor skills because children will be scooping, pouring, and moving objects in a sensory box. Provide easy ways of cleanup. One worry that many parents and teachers have about sensory boxes is the mess that they'll cause. It is true that sensory boxes aren't the cleanest and tidiest activity to do and will cause a few messes, however, a few easy methods can prevent a giant mess in the end. Place a mat or tablecloth underneath the sensory box to keep your surface clean. Have a broom and dustpan nearby to sweep up any fallen objects. If possible, play with sensory boxes in a sink, tub, or outdoors for quick and easy clean-up. Dollar Store shower curtains and large sheets are excellent mats to place underneath a sensory box. Provide simple sensory box rules for a large group of children. Demonstrate to children that the objects in a sensory box shouldn't be thrown around and shouldn't be tossed on the floor. Place the sensory box in an area that can be used easily. Some people place sensory boxes on the floor, while others place it on tables or desks. It all depends on what your child prefers and what type of sensory box you are using. A child might prefer to play sitting down on the floor, sitting on a chair, or play standing up. Make sure the sensory box can be accessed easily and that others can see it as well. Store the sensory box for later. The great thing about sensory boxes is that they can be reused and played with another time. Close the sensory box with a tight lid and place it in a safe area where it cannot be touched or dropped. Open it again when it's ready to be played with. You may also store the base or filler into a plastic bag and pour it back into the sensory box another time. Note that some objects in a sensory box might spoil, melt, and rot over time. Some items can only be used once. This includes some cooked foods, ice, snow, bubble foam, and other similar items. Creating a Sensory Box Create a holiday-themed sensory box. If a holiday is near, a sensory box that's themed for it makes a great activity for play and exploration.

After reading an enjoyable book, sensory boxes are a great way to reflect on the different events that happened in the story. Search for items and parts that were in the book and turn it into a sensory box. You may want the book near you while everyone explores and plays with the sensory box so they are able to understand and remember the different parts of the story. Make a one filler sensory box. While sensory boxes could be made more entertaining with plenty of different materials, they can always be simple and have one filler with lots of tools for exploring. These take less time to create and encourage creativity and motor skills. Use a base such as dry rice, pasta, oats, cereal, water beads, or slime to a sensory box. Add plenty of tools such as shovels, mixing spoons, funnels, bowls, and measuring cups to increase exploration. Create a nature sensory box. Even the simple things in nature can make a sensory box fun! Nature sensory boxes allow you and your little ones to go outside and find items to fill in their sensory box. Best of all, these sensory boxes are great for playing with outdoors. Look around and find materials that will match your nature-themed sensory box. Some ideas include:\n\nFlower sensory box: Gather spring flowers, flower petals soil, small rocks, a watering can, and shovels. Allow your child to dig and stick flowers to the soil. Add a bit of water for a better sensory experience. Acorn and pinecone sensory box: Gather acorns, pinecones, measuring cups, measuring spoons, and tongs. Allow your child to pick up acorns and pinecones and to scoop them up. Leaves sensory box: Gather leaves in all shapes and sizes, scissors, paint, and paint brushes. Let your child paint on the leaves or cut the leaves into pieces with the scissors. Mud sensory box: Mud can be made by combining soil and water, or they can be scooped up after a rainy day. Add shovels, measuring cups, funnels, and toys for further fun. Make a magnetic sensory box. Throw in a little bit of science into sensory boxes by making a magnetic one! Add a base or filler to a sensory box and hide mini magnets in it such as paperclips, screws, fridge magnets, and nails. Use a magnetic bar or horseshoe magnet to dig in the sensory box and find all the magnets. You can also throw in a few objects to the sensory box that are non-magnetic. This could provide an opportunity to learn what's magnetic and what's not. Create a calm down sensory box. Sensory boxes are known to be a relaxing and calming resource for those with anxiety, stress, and anger. A calm down sensory box is usually filled with relaxing objects like tangle toys, squishy balls, sensory bottles, weighted stuffed animals, putty, and other sensory toys. Calm down sensory boxes can also have printables that share relaxation techniques such as taking deep breaths. Go for creative food sensory boxes. For younger children who still haven't understood the idea of how everything can't be put in your mouth, edible sensory boxes are a great activity to consider. Create a simple food sensory box using pudding, whipped cream, cooked pasta, cooked rice, breadcrumbs, edible play-dough, or jello. You can even be creative and try different methods to make an edible sensory box themed after a place. Be cautious about the types of food you use for an edible sensory box. Many foods with small pieces can be a choking hazard for children under the age of three. Playing with a Sensory Box Bring opportunities for learning. Sensory boxes have so many benefits and offer so many options for children to practice any skills they're learning. Magnetic letters and numbers can be added to practice phonics and mathematical skills. Themed sensory boxes can also teach different seasons, language skills, colors, shapes, animals, and objects in the world. Don't be afraid to talk to your child about what they're feeling and touching. For example, you might ask your child \"What does the shaving cream feel like? What color is it?\" This encourages children to speak about their observations and sensory experience. Play 'I Spy' when exploring the sensory box. 'I Spy' is an excellent and engaging game that encourages children to look around in the sensory box and search for objects that are not visible unless explored for. Digging tools such as shovels, spoons, mini cups, and other similar items can make the game for enjoyable and entertaining. Be descriptive! This can increase your child's language skills. For, example, you might say \"I spy a little blue duck wearing a pink bow.\" Use words that describe the object you are spying. Encourage your child to do the same. Scoop, move, and pick up items in the sensory box. Cup, jars, lids, caps, bottles, bowls, dishes, and trays allow your child to pick up and place items in different areas. Spoons and other similar tools increase a child's motor skills as they practice scooping and moving objects in a sensory box. Engage in imaginative or pretend play. Sensory boxes, especially themed ones, allow children to play pretend and engage in different types of imaginative activities. For example, playing with a farm animal sensory box allows children to pretend they're farmers caring for animals. Talk and discuss what your child is doing as they play. Don't be afraid to join in the fun and pretend with them! Create different shapes and outlines. Use your fingers to trace letters, shapes, and outlines onto the base of your sensory box. Bases like bubble foam, salt, play-dough, and shaving cream allow you to create different shapes and drawings if you trace your finger on it. Cut or slice certain items, if possible. Plastic knives and scissors can be used to experiment with cutting and breaking items apart. While plastic tools can't cut things like paper, they can snip play-dough, slime, and other objects that are easy to slice. Never add actual scissors and knives that are sharp to the sensory box. Children can seriously hurt themselves while playing and experimenting. Dig for materials inside the sensory box. Shovels and spoons bring opportunities for digging and exploring even further in a sensory box. Good bases that can be dug for include sand, dirt, soil, shaving cream, and shredded paper. Add mini items that can be searched for such as magnets, toy people, or even pretend dinosaur bones for a fossil discovery activity. Be creative! Your options are limitless. Squish and roll different items. Bases such as slime, play-dough, putty, mud, hair gel, and other wet textures can be squished and rolled for more sensory fun. Don't be afraid to dig your hands into different textures to feel all the items in the sensory box. Tools like rolling pins and potato mashers can encourage squishing and rolling. Pat and shake objects in the sensory box. Patting and shaking objects increase your sensory experience because you can hear and feel the items in a sensory box. Scoop small items in jars, cups, and jugs and shake them around so they can make noises. You can also pat objects with your hands or a tool to flatten them. Most dry objects that are small such as dry rice, pasta, or popcorn kernels can be shaken if they're added into containers or cups. Squishy items like play-dough, slime, and putty can be pat gently. Be creative and enjoy yourself! With so many ideas, themes, and materials, sensory boxes leave endless possibilities and can always be changed around. Never feel like you need to make a sensory box exactly as instructed; You can always omit, add, and replace items in the box. Don't forget to enjoy yourself and simply let loose, after all, that's the best part when playing with a sensory box.",
