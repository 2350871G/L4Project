          "description":"This is one of the oldest methods used to control microbes. Bring a large pot of water to a hard boil and carefully drop in the items that need to be disinfected. Most non-electrical glass, metal, and hard plastics are heat-resistant. Heat the water to at least 100 \u00b0C (212 \u00b0F) to kill bacteria, fungi and their spores, and almost all viruses. Allow the items to air dry on paper towels or a clean towel after removing them from the water. Use this technique to clean baby bottles, pacifiers, and small children\u2019s toys. It will also work for any heat-resistant item that needs to be disinfected and will fit in the pot."

          "headline":"Use a conventional microwave oven to sterilize sponges and dishcloths.",
          "description":"Microwave ovens kill microbes on the food we eat, but they can also be used to kill microbes on other items as well. Place wet kitchen sponges, dishcloths, and scrub pads in the microwave and heat them on high for 2 minutes. Also try it on your baby bottles! Microwaving will effectively kill bacteria, viruses, parasites, and spores. Disinfect sponges, wash cloths, and scrub pads daily or at least every 3 days. Make sure there is no metallic content in the items you put in the microwave. Items sterilized in the microwave will be very hot. Use oven mitts or allow the items to cool down before removing them."

          "headline":"Treat wounds and disinfect surfaces naturally with tea tree oil.",
          "description":"Tea tree oil, also known as melaleuca, is a natural antiseptic that works to control microbial growth on living tissue and hard surfaces. However, the oil may not be strong enough to kill all viruses and bacteria. Apply a drop of the tea tree oil directly to a wound or mix 2-4 drops of the oil with coconut oil to cover larger areas. Tea tree oil can burn a little, so mixing it with coconut oil also helps to soothe the burning. Use the tea tree oil as an antibacterial household cleaner. Mix 20 drops of tea tree oil, \u20444 cup (180 mL) of water and a \u20442 cup (120 mL) of apple cider vinegar together. Use the solution in a spray bottle for easy, effective cleaning."

      "steps":[
        {
          "headline":"Disinfect hard surfaces with rubbing alcohol.",
          "description":"Use isopropyl alcohol with at least 70% concentration to be effective. However, the alcohol comes in concentrations up to 100%, and the higher the concentration, the more effective the alcohol will be. Pour some alcohol on a clean cloth and wipe down infected items and surfaces. The alcohol evaporates quickly, so there is no need to wipe or rinse it off. Isopropyl rubbing alcohol works to control the growth of fungi, bacteria, and some viruses. The length of time of exposure in order to be effective depends on the type of microbe. For instance, Salmonella, E. coli, and most other viruses and bacteria are killed in 10 seconds, but M. tuberculosis takes 5 minutes to kill. Immerse items in the alcohol if they need extended exposure. Apply alcohol-based hand sanitizer to dirty hands or use rubbing alcohol on gauze or a cotton ball to swab the skin before an injection. Rubbing alcohol is extremely flammable. It must be stored in a cool, dry place with good airflow."

          "headline":"Use hydrogen peroxide to disinfect porous and non-porous surfaces.",
          "description":"Use it on a cloth to clean hard, non-porous surfaces that are made of glass, plastic, or metal. Spot-disinfect contaminated porous surfaces that are made out of cardboard, untreated wood, or fabric using a clean cloth. Allow the surfaces to air-dry\nThe peroxide is effective in controlling bacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses, and spores. All concentrations of peroxide are effective, however, the higher the concentration, the faster it works. Try disinfecting soft contact lenses by soaking them in 3% peroxide for 2\u20133 hours. While hydrogen peroxide is commonly used as an antiseptic to treat minor flesh wounds, it has actually been found to delay the healing process and isn\u2019t recommended."

        {
          "headline":"Use household bleach to sanitize or disinfect hard surfaces.",
          "description":"To sanitize surfaces, mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of bleach with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of cool water. To disinfect surfaces, mix \u20444\u2013\u20444 cup (59\u2013177 mL) of bleach with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of cool water. Air dry, or allow the solution to sit on the surface for 2 minutes before wiping it off. Disinfect kitchen sinks daily. Bathrooms, door knobs, and other frequently used items like keys, cell phones, and remote controls should be disinfected at least once per week. Bleach can also be used to decontaminate drinking water. Add \u20448 teaspoon (0.62 mL) of 6% regular household bleach to 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Stir, and let it stand for 30 minutes before drinking. Bleach can irritate the skin, eyes, or nose. Wear gloves, safety goggles, and use the bleach in a well-ventilated area to minimize irritation. The bleach can also discolor fabric, so be careful when using it around soft surfaces."
