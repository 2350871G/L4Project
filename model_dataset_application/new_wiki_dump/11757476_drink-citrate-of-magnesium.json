If you\u2019ve only had a small snack or bite to eat, you can wait just 1 hour instead of 2.If you take other supplements or medications, don't take them within 2 hours of taking magnesium citrate because it could cause your body to absorb less of the medication.

Otherwise, stick to the basic recommendations:Anyone over 12 years of age: 5 to 10 fluid ounces (150 to 300 mL) with 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water in a single dose or divided doses.

You might find it easier to drink the magnesium citrate after letting the bottle chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. You don\u2019t have to chill it, but it can help soften the bitter, metallic taste.To help mask the taste, mix the liquid with 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of a flavored sports drink or juice. If you choose to mix it, you don\u2019t need to drink another 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water. If you\u2019re an adult, you can take up to 10 fluid ounces (300 mL) of magnesium citrate per day. Take it all at once or in 2 separate doses. If you\u2019re giving it to a child ages 6 to 12, don\u2019t give them more than 5 fluid ounces (150 mL) per day unless your pediatrician says it\u2019s okay."
