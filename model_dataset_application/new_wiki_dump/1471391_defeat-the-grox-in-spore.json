Buy 3 colony incredi-paks.  Find a wormhole that leads you close to the center of the galaxy. If a wormhole doesn't lead the to the center of the galaxy, go back in and find another one. Once you are close to the center of the galaxy, find a good star that has a lot of empires around to trade with, is close to the grox, and has good spice. Purple spice is the best. Just abandon your home planet. If it gets attacked, don't go defend it. Terraform the planet to T3.  Place all three of your colony incredipaks.  If you have enough money, fill up all the colonies with buildings. If not, make money from missions. Now to start killing the grox. Find one of their star systems and zoom in on an inhabited planet very fast.

Just repeat until you finish all the planets. You may colonize the planets if you want.  Anti Matter Missiles This is the best way if you don't want to colonize that planet.  Buy lots of anti matter missiles from a empire with the warrior archetype. They sell the cheapest weapons. (Including the uber turret and Planet Buster) Buy as much as you can so you don't have to refill for a long time. Start attacking the planets. Aim the missile at the center of a city.

Continue doing this until all cities are demolished. Remember to keep refilling on the missiles.  Bombs Bombs are the best way if you do not want to spend your cash, or you are short on cash but too eager to start destroying Grox. Not the best method though... Get the highest level bomb available and buy the shield upgrade. Bombs and shield are the cheapest in the warrior empire. Enter the Grox empire planet and activate your shield. Quickly go to a city and start bombing the city in the center. Make this quick as the shield will run out after awhile. If there are more than one cities, fly around wait for the shield to recharge (if the shield has deactivated and still recharging). Repeat the process. This is very time consuming.  Planet Busters Planet busters are the fastest way to destroy a planet, but you can't get the planet back without the Grox.  Planet busters are the cheapest in a Warrior archetype empire.  To deploy, fly into a planet and launch the planet buster in any location. Beware the any empire near you besides the Grox will hate you for breaking the galactic code. Watch the scene unravel.  The planet will be gone forever, so is the colony on of the Grox Empire.  The Grox will hate you for destroying their colonies, but apparently you get a +15 by breaking the galactic code.  Allies If there are empires near the Grox empire, you can ally them and pay them to destroy their systems.  You need to have enough money to get your allies to attack them.  Empires can't attack Grox if they are too far away.  You may also use monolith to uplift any species. (You only need 1 animal) Unique Abilities The easiest way, if you are a Zealot or Scientist empire.  Go to one of the Grox planets, and use the Fanatical Frenzy (Zealot's unique ability) or Gravitation Wave (Scientist's unique ability). One will convert the system or your empire; the other will wipe out all the cities from the planet. Save, exit and re-enter the game to recharge the abilities instantly. ",
