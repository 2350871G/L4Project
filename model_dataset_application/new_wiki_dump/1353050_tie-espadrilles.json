Fold the string in half and stick one half through the bottom eyelet on the left and the other half through the bottom eyelet on the right. Then criss-cross the laces up through the remaining eyelets. Create different looks by starting the laces under the flaps and wrapping over them, or starting the laces over the flaps and wrapping under them."

Lightly drop the laces once you\u2019ve crossed them. Depending on the design of the shoe, you may be able to skip this step.

Stop when you have only enough material to tie a bow, which should be a few inches. Depending on how big you want the bow to be, you can adjust how much material you leave. For bigger bows, stop when you have about 6 inches (15 cm). For smaller bows, leave less than 3 inches (7.5 cm)."
