          "description":"Measure your shower to determine the size of liner and shower curtain you will need. You will want your liner to fit in your shower for appearance and so it does its job of preventing water from escaping into your bathroom. Most liners for a standard size shower are 70 by 72 inches (1.8 by 1.8 m). Make sure your liner stretches between the two walls and reaches down to the floor so no water escapes. There are extra long liners that are 70 by 84 inches (1.8 by 2.1 m) or 72 by 84 inches (1.8 by 2.1 m). You can purchase an extra wide liner that is 144 by 72 inches (3.7 by 1.8 m). If you have a stall shower, instead of a traditional bathtub size shower, there are shower stall liners that are 54 by 78 inches (1.4 by 2.0 m)."

Some people think that vinyl liners look cheaper than fabric ones, but vinyl liners stick to the sides of the tub to help prevent water from spilling on the floor. Vinyl liners are also easier to clean because you can just wipe them down with a sponge or cloth. Fabric liners need to be washed regularly since they can grow mold. Fabric liners tend to be machine wash only and blow away from the tub, which can cause water to spill. However, fabric liners are more durable and last longer than vinyl liners."
