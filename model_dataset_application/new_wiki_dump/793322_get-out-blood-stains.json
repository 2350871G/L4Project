          "description":"The first step with any fresh blood stain is to flush the stain with cold water. If it is a minimal amount of blood, you may be able to remove the majority of the stain with just cold water. Run the fabric under a cold tap, gently rubbing the stain with the water. Soak your fabric in cold water in your sink to loosen any remaining stain. Wash the material in cold water afterward. Make sure you do not use hot water. This will set the blood into the fabric and make the stain harder to remove. If you don't have access to a tap, you can also put cold water in a bowl or bucket and dunk the fabric in the water. Keep dunking, rubbing and rinsing until the stain is removed. Wash the fabric in cold water afterward. This method works on all kinds of fabrics, such as denim, cotton and linen."

          "headline":"Wash with dishwashing liquid.",
          "description":"If your stain is too tough for cold water alone, try using dishwashing liquid. Pour 1 tablespoon of liquid directly onto the fabric. Make sure it saturates the fabric. Let the liquid sit on the stain for 15 to 30 minutes. The stain should loosen. Rub cold water over the stain to remove the soap. Wash in cold water. If the stain persists, you may need to repeat this method or try an alternative method."

        {
          "headline":"Use bar soap.",
          "description":"You can use bar soap for more concentrated stains. Rinse the fabric with cold water. Then, rub the bar of soap into the stain until the fabric lathers. Rub the fabric together to help scrub in the soap and loosen the stain. Rinse the soap and loosened blood out of the fabric. If the stain is still there, reapply the soap. Wash in cold water."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try hydrogen peroxide.",
          "description":"You can also try hydrogen peroxide on light-colored or white fabrics. After you rinse with cold water, pour a generous amount of peroxide directly onto the fabric. Rub the peroxide into the fabric to saturate it. Let the peroxide sit on the stain for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Wash the material in cold water. If the stain persists, you can repeat the process. If the peroxide bubbles when it hits the fabric, don't be alarmed. This is a normal response. It means that the peroxide is dissolving the proteins in the blood and lifting out the stain."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Make a salt and shampoo stain remover.",
          "description":"Instead of buying a stain remover, you can make one at home. Rinse as much blood out as you can with cold water. Next, soak the fabric in cold water for 15 minutes. Ring out the excess water from the fabric. Rub a tablespoon of table salt into the stain on the damp fabric. Pour a tablespoon of shampoo onto the salt and rub the fabric together. Once the shampoo starts to lather, add another tablespoon of salt. Rub the combination into the fabric. Rinse the fabric completely in cold water. Wash the fabric in cold water. This works only on fabrics that do not need special care. Do not use this method on clothes that you would wash on the gentle cycle in your clothes washer. This also works on set-in stains."

          "description":"If you have a blood stain on a delicate garment, you need to use a different kind of stain remover. Soak the garment in cold water for 15 to 30 minutes. Pour a small amount of baking soda onto the fabric. Rub it into the stained area with a nail brush or soft toothbrush. Wash the garment on the delicate cycle in cold water."

          "description":"If you have a stain that is dry or set-in, you need to pre-treat the fabric. Using a laundry stain remover, spray your fabric with enough liquid to saturate the fabric. Let the stain remover sit for 15 minutes. Rinse with cold water. If the stain is still there, treat the fabric again. Wash the fabric in cold water with an enzyme-based detergent, such as Arm & Hammer, Gain or Tide. If the stain is not removed when you wash the fabric, you need to treat it again before you dry it. Drying the fabric will cook in the blood stain. You can buy stain removers in most grocery stores' laundry sections. Try Resolve Spray & Wash or OxyClean Max Force laundry stain remover."

          "headline":"Use diluted ammonia.",
          "description":"You don't have to rely on just pre-treatment options. After you treat a stain once with pre-treatment remover, dilute 1 tablespoon of ammonia in 1 cup of water. Dab the stain with a cotton swab or cotton ball soaked in the diluted ammonia. Keep changing the cotton swabs or balls whenever they get saturated with blood residue. You don't want to rub the stain back into the fabric. Let the ammonia solution sit on the fabric for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Wash the fabric in cold water. You can place paper towels behind the fabric you are treating to keep the stain from running onto the fabric behind the stained portion. Paper towels also help absorb the diluted ammonia as you apply it. Do not put ammonia directly onto the fabric. It could discolor the fabric or break down the fabric's fibers."

          "headline":"Apply meat tenderizer.",
          "description":"If a stain is persistent, you can try unseasoned meat tenderizer on the stain. First, soak your fabric in cold water for several hours. This loosens the stain and helps soften the fabric. Next, mix 1 tablespoon of unseasoned meat tenderizer, such as McCormick's, with 2 teaspoons of water to make a paste. Rub the paste into the blood stain with your fingers. Allow the paste to sit on the stain for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the excess paste and wash your item in cold water. Before you apply the meat tenderizer, you can also run your fabric through a cold wash with light, enzyme-based detergents."

          "headline":"Use cornstarch and hydrogen peroxide.",
          "description":"If you have a stain on a surface, such as a mattress, that is not washable, you need to use different kinds of stain removers. Take 1/2 cup of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of salt and mix them with 1/4 cup of hydrogen peroxide to make a paste. Apply the paste directly to the stain with a spoon. Let the paste sit on the stain until it dries. Then, scrape off the dry paste. If the stain is still present, repeat. You should not use peroxide on dark fabrics unless you first test the peroxide on an area that is not visible. The peroxide can have the same effect as bleach. It can cause the fabric to change colors."

Rub the liquid into the stain with a toothbrush. Wash the fabric normally. If the stain persists, repeat this method before you dry the fabric."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use bleach.",
          "description":"Bleach is an alternative if you have a stubborn blood stain. Soak the fabric in cold water for 30 minutes. Wash the fabric once in cold water with your normal detergent. Next, wash your clothes with your normal detergent but add a solution of 1 tablespoon of bleach mixed with one cup of water. The type of bleach you use will depend on the color of fabric. If the fabric is white, you can use traditional bleach. If the fabric is colored, you need to use color safe bleach. Look for color safe bleach that is safe to apply directly to the stained fabric. Rub the color safe bleach into the fabric. Wash the fabric like normal in cold water."
