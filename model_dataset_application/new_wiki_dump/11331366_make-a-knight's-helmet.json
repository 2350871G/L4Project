          "description":"This will be the section of your helmet that wraps around your face and head. Lay the poster board flat on the table and use a ruler to mark a rectangle that\u2019s 10 in (25 cm) wide and 28 in (71 cm) long. Use scissors to cut out this section of poster board. Don't worry if the rectangle section is too long, you can trim it later on. Purchase poster board from your local craft or big box store."

          "description":"If your helmet is just going to be made of poster board, feel free to paint it a solid color like silver or gold. Use spray paint for a quick application, or use a paint brush and acrylic paints to paint the helmet section using even strokes. Use two coats to ensure the poster board is fully covered. Let the paint dry completely before continuing to work with the poster board. This should take 1-2 hours."

          "description":"If you\u2019re putting foam or colored paper on your helmet to make it textured or colorful, use an adhesive like glue or tape to attach the material to the poster board. Make sure you don\u2019t cover up the fold you just created, lining up the paper or foam with the fold before attaching it. Flip the poster board over so that any excess foam or paper is visible, cutting it off using scissors so the poster board and additional materials are in line with each other."

          "description":"The top of the helmet is made by drawing a circle slightly larger than your head onto a piece of poster board (and any other materials you\u2019re using with the poster board). Once the circle is drawn, make a dot a few inches away from the circle, connecting it to the circle using a ruler so that the shape now resembles a teardrop. You can find templates online for the top of the helmet to make creating it easier. Consider creating a double layer of poster board to make the top sturdier. Use a plate to help you draw a perfect circle, if desired."

Measure a rectangle that\u2019s roughly 5 in (13 cm) wide and 4 in (10 cm) high\u2014this will be your eye slit. Use scissors or a precision blade to remove the eye portion from the large rectangle. Make sure the center of your eye slit is lined up with the fold in the helmet."

          "description":"Join the two ends of the rectangle together, putting it on your head or the other person\u2019s head to see where you\u2019ll need to attach it. Use tape or a stapler to hold the two ends together. To hide the tape, put it on the inside of the helmet. Masking tape or duct tape works best."

Slide the top section of the helmet into the sides, lining the tip of the teardrop shape with the fold in the rectangle. Push it down until the top of the helmet is touching the table. This will make it easy to hot glue or tape the two pieces together from the inside. If the top section is too big to fit into the helmet\u2019s sides, trim it using scissors. If the top section is too small for the helmet's sides, you can either redo it and make it larger, or use a thick tape to attach it to the helmet's sides anyway. Be careful if you\u2019re using hot glue, making sure not to touch the metal tip of the glue gun."

Use a knife or sharp pen to form the hole before sticking the feather inside and gluing it in place.
