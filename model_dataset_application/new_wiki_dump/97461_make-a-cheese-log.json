  "text":" Steps Take the Velveeta cheese out of its box and cut the block into thirds.  Take one third of the cheese and knead it, softening it so that you can work it like Play Dough.  Spread the piece of kneaded cheese out on a flat surface, evenly thinning it out. Don't make it thinner than a quarter of an inch, or thicker than half an inch. Use the sides of your hands to make the edges of the spread cheese even and flat. Form it into a flat rectangle, or a square. Unwrap the cream cheese. Slice off pieces and carefully spread them onto the cheese with a spatula. Use a method similar to spreading icing on a cake. Cover the entire surface of the square of cheese with cream cheese. Open the can of olives. Generously sprinkle them over the layer cream cheese. You should use most of the can. Open the can of green peppers. Like the last step, generously sprinkle them over the olives and layer of cream cheese. Again, you should use most of the can. This part is tricky. Carefully, take the edges of the bottom of the square of cheese and roll them upward. Once you have that small round cylinder, you can keep on rolling gently until the whole square has become a log. Wrap your cheese log in aluminum foil. Keep in the refrigerator. Serving: Unwrap cheese log and lay it on a decorative plate. Put out spreading knives and crackers to eat it on. Enjoy! Alternative method Heat oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C).  Spread walnuts in a shallow pan and toast, stirring occasionally, until golden (about 8 to 10 minutes).
