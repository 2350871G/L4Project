          "description":"Whatever the dish you\u2019re making, tempering eggs for it is a lot easier than you might think. As long as you work quickly and by adding only a small amount of hot liquid to your eggs, your eggs will be tempered in no time. To do it right, you\u2019ll need:\nHeat resistant bowl. It\u2019s important to beat your eggs in a tempered glass (like Pyrex) bowl, or a ceramic bowl, so it won\u2019t heat up and cook the eggs from underneath. You want the liquid to do the cooking, not the surface, which will cause the eggs to curdle. Whisk. The technique requires that you aggressively whisk the eggs while adding hot liquid, making a whisk useful. In a pinch, a fork is a fine alternative. Ladle. You\u2019ll need something to spoon the hot liquid from the pot, preferably a large ladle with a spout, so you can control how much you add."

          "description":"Depending on your recipe, you might have anywhere between 1 and 6 eggs that you\u2019re preparing to temper, but the process will be the same regardless of the amounts. Crack all your eggs into your heat resistant bowl, then beat them until thoroughly integrated. Continue whipping the eggs until they just become frothy. Beaten eggs, as you\u2019d make for scrambled eggs, will be more likely to curdle, since the consistency will be thicker. You want more of an omelet consistency. When you start to see a foam appear on the top of the eggs, you\u2019re in good shape. Let the eggs sit and come up to room temperature while you make the rest of the recipe. It\u2019s more difficult to temper very cold eggs, so it\u2019s important to let them come up to room temp gently before tempering."

You want to add a small amount of the hot liquid you\u2019re using to temper, while whisking the eggs vigorously at the same time. When you\u2019re sure the eggs haven\u2019t curdled, add a little more. Continue in this way until the eggs are tempered. Start with a tablespoon or two and wait until you\u2019re sure it isn\u2019t curdling to add more. Some recipes will play fast and loose with the instructions, telling you to add a whole ladle full of boiling milk to eggs. It\u2019s safer to start with smaller amounts and gradually bring the heat up. Continue adding until you\u2019ve increased the volume of the eggs by at least half."

At this point, the eggs are essentially cooked without having scrambled. You can pour it all in at once, give it a few stirs, and the tempering is done. You don\u2019t have to worry about the eggs curdling at this point. The mixture helps to thicken broths and custards, creating a rich sauce.

Most famously, this is the technique used for making spaghetti carbonara, the simple combination of noodles, egg, pancetta (or bacon), and lots and lots of black pepper. Carbonara is typically made with spaghetti noodles, but also can be made with any noodle you like to eat. Technique-wise, it's sometimes easier to temper the eggs in the pan using longer noodles, which tangle together to create a larger surface and keep the eggs off the bottom of the pan, so they won't scramble.

You can use other kinds of cheese, but drier, flakier cheeses like parmesan usually integrate more easily into the egg and melt more quickly than some other kinds. In a carbonara, you'll also add lots and lots of black pepper to the eggs before you add it to the pasta.

Cook your pasta separately, then add it to the skillet with the other ingredients. Put the skillet on low heat, stirring the noodles in the meat and vegetables to heat it gently. The goal is to warm the egg on the top side of the pasta before it works through to the bottom of the pan, where it will likely start to curdle.

Remove the skillet from the heat when you see steam and fork the noodles into a separate bowl. Eggs cook much more quickly than most people think, so heating the noodles through gently and having them at the proper temperature when you had them should temper the eggs very quickly, coating the noodles in a rich and thick cheesy sauce.
