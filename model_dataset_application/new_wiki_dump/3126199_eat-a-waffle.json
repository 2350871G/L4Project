Use the fork to pick up the piece and bring it to your mouth. Wait until you chew and swallow before cutting another small piece. If the syrup drains off the waffle piece when you pick it up with the fork, dip it into the excess syrup on the plate before taking your bite.

In Belgium, there are two main types of waffles, Brussels and Liege waffles. While Brussels waffles are eaten with a knife and fork, Liege waffles are generally eaten with the hands. Liege waffles are sold as street food, and they typically aren't garnished the way other waffles are. Instead, Liege waffles have rocks of sugar in the batter, and the sugar melts and crystallizes when the waffles cook."
