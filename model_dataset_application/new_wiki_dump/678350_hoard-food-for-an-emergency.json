Planning emergency meals in advance can save money since you can keep an eye out for deals and coupons and buy some of the supplies at warehouse stores. Good options for emergency food include ready-to-eat canned meats, fruits, and vegetables (with a can opener), fruit bars and protein bars, dry cereals or granola or other grains, peanut butter, dried fruit, canned juices, and non-perishable milk (the kind that doesn't require refrigeration), and cooking oil if needed."
