          "description":"If you already have a classic or custom type of drink in mind, go for it. However, if you\u2019re wondering what types of drinks to feature at your party, the season can be great source of inspiration. Maybe you want to make hot buttered cider for a winter dinner party. On the other hand, maybe you\u2019re hosting a summer lawn party, and want to set up a DIY lemonade station. Be sure to choose something that will allow for you and your guests' creativity. Following the lemonade example, your station could feature freshly juiced lemonade, some other juices or flavored seltzer waters to add, and garnishing like fresh berries, mint leaves, and lavender petals."

          "description":"This includes both liquid ingredients as well as add-ins. Once you\u2019ve selected the type of drink station you want to set up, think about all of the specific ingredients you want to provide. Look online for further information, by searching for different recipes of the drink you\u2019re thinking about. Don\u2019t forget about fruit and fresh herbs, as they can add visual appeal and the aroma they offer can make a great drink even better. Note that many different types of drinks can be made with or without alcohol. Allowing your guests to make that choice themselves ensures that their drinks are just what they were hoping for."

          "headline":"Cut and juice ahead of time.",
          "description":"Many drink recipes call for specific ingredients to be juiced or cut into sizes appropriate for garnishing. For instance, many cocktails call for lime juice and/or a lime slice. Be sure prepare any ingredients that require dangerous or significant preparation beforehand. Be sure to prepare enough! It's best to avoid using knives or blenders during a party. Whenever you\u2019re using a recipe that calls for juice of any type, consider juicing fresh fruits the day of the party for the best flavor."

          "description":"So, you\u2019ve decided on a Bloody Mary bar. You plan to offer a few different types of tomato juice and pre-made Bloody Mary mixes, a few different types of liquor, a plethora of vegetables and other add-ins, and a fridge door\u2019s worth of different hot sauce. Your guests have plenty to work with and will undoubtedly wind up making some great drinks. That said, some guests may appreciate a bit of guidance. For instance, write down your recommended recipe and make a sign that says something like \u201cSarah\u2019s Sassy Bloody Maria: 2 oz tequila, 2 stalks of pickled asparagus, 2 pearl onions, in a glass rimmed with powdered beef jerky and filled to the brim with McClure\u2019s Bloody Mary Mix.\u201d"

          "description":"Even if you specify a classic cocktail drink station, you\u2019ll want to offer some variety in terms of the main ingredient. For instance, maybe you\u2019ll focus on offering specialty ingredients for the finest martinis in town, with a few choice bottles of vodka and gin in particular. You might as well put out a bottle of bourbon and another of tequila as well. Don\u2019t forget liquors. Depending on the types of drink you want to offer, vermouths and certain cordials will be vital. Bitters are great too, and come in all sorts of flavors. Further, not everyone who drinks alcohol likes to drink liquor. If you want to make sure there are options for everyone, it\u2019s worth putting out an ice bucket with some beers and a bottle of champagne."

          "description":"Even when you\u2019re hosting an adult party and expect the booze to be flowing, you should always make sure guests can find a non-alcoholic option when they\u2019re ready to slow down for the evening. If nothing else, a water pitcher is always a good idea. Another great option to set out is carbonated water. Many people enjoy drinking sparkling water on its own, while others will likely use to it spritz drinks of all sorts."

This is important for several reasons, including notifying those who may be allergic to certain items. If you\u2019re using squeeze bottles, simply add a piece of masking tape and write the contents on the tape in permanent marker. If you have bowls of a bunch of dry ingredients, especially spices, make mini signs you can attach to toothpicks or skewers and stick into the bowl as well."

For instance, if you\u2019ve made a large batch of hot chocolate, you\u2019ll likely want to keep it in a vessel that will preserve its warmth. A ladle can then be used to dole out single portions into mugs, and guests can add liqueur, marshmallows, etc. as they wish.

On the other hand, you may need to keep drinks warm. In this case, keep the base liquid - such as hot apple cider - in a crock pot. Turn the crock pot on and set it to \"low\" or \"keep warm.\""

Use squeeze bottles to hold popular, common ingredients like lime juice or simple syrup. Other equipment that can make self-service simpler includes items like stirring utensils and drink strainers.
