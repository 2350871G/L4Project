  "text":" Making the Cake Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C/Fan 160 degrees C/Gas 4. Grease the two cake tins then line with baking parchment. Wash your hands. Nobody wants to eat a cake that has been handled by dirty hands do they? Get out a big bowl, weighing scales, a wooden spoon (or electric cake mixer), and a sieve. Then get self-raising flour, two eggs, caster sugar, unsalted butter (or a butter meant for cooking) and vanilla essence or extract. Make sure your work surface is clear (as clear as it can be with this many items!) Weigh 100 grams (4 oz) of caster sugar. Pour into the bowl, making sure not to spill any. Measure 100 grams (4 oz) of butter. Cut into small chunks, then put it in the bowl as well. Cream the sugar and the butter together. Cream it together in the same way you would spread icing over a cake. Push it to the sides of the bowl. Eventually, it should look like it isn't two separate ingredients. Break the 2 eggs into the bowl. Make sure not to get any shell in there. Mix it with the sugar and the butter. Don't worry if it looks disgusting - just make sure it doesn't curdle. Sieve 100 grams (4 oz) of self raising flower into the mixture. Fold it in. The mixture should turn creamy and yellow. It should not be dough. Mix thoroughly. (Optional) add between one and four teaspoons of vanilla essence/extract into the mixture for a unique vanilla taste. Mix thoroughly into the cake mixture. Divide the mixture evenly between two 15 cm (6 inch) cake tins. Cook for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, check the cakes are ready.
