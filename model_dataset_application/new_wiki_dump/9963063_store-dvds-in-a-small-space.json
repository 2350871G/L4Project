Hang the shelves far enough above a seating area where guests won\u2019t hit their heads, but low enough that you\u2019re still able to reach them. Put floating shelves above your TV to make a focal point in your living area that\u2019s the ultimate entertainment center."

          "description":"Choose a closet that is spacious enough so the rack won\u2019t hit any shelves inside. Measure the depth of the rack to make sure it will fit when the door is shut. A front hall closet makes a perfect space to hide your DVDs so they are out of your way but easy to access. Purchase wire racks that hang on the back of the door and are large enough to hold DVD cases. If your closet has a wooden door, you can build your own wooden shelves and nail them to the inside of the door. A rack can be added to any door, like a bedroom door, but it will hit the wall when you open it. Make sure the rack is held securely since the door will constantly be opening and closing."

          "description":"The space underneath your bed is a discreet place to keep all of your DVDs. Use a plastic tote that fits under the space and is large enough to house all of your movies. If you can, stack your DVDs so the spines are facing up. This will make it easier to sort through your movies and you\u2019ll be able to see the titles without digging through the whole container. Use multiple tote bins if you cannot find one large enough to hold all your DVDs. If you do this, consider organizing your totes alphabetical or by genre so it\u2019s easier to pull out the correct tote."

Keep the jewel cases on a CD rack or in baskets near your TV. Thin jewel cases can be purchased at any electronic or big box stores. Many cases will let you put a sheet of paper in the cover. Cut down the paper sleeves from your DVD boxes to keep the box art with your DVDs. Rubber band jewel cases together if a DVD comes with more than 1 disc."

Print out a list of what movies are in the binder and keep it in the plastic insert on the outside of the binder so you know which movies are in which binder.
