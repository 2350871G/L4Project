If this is the case, and if you\u2019re going to send a family member or friend to get them, pick a word or phrase that they will have to give so your kid knows it\u2019s safe to go with them.

For example, there should be at least 2 escape routes from your home that you can take, if not more. Plot 2 to 3 routes to get from your house to the decided upon meet-up location in case you need to evacuate. To be extra prepared, print out maps of your town and a layout of your house and highlight the different routes that can be taken. This way, if someone is panicking and can\u2019t remember where to go, they can look at the map.
