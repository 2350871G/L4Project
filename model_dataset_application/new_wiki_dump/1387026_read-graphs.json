So if you read up to the dot, line or top of the bar for salmon in August then read across to the left and hit \"10,000,\" you know 10,000 salmon returned in August. If you hit a point between any two labeled graph increments, you have to estimate based on where you land between the 2 increments. For example, if you hit a point halfway between 10,000 and 15,000, you can safely estimate that the correct number is about 12,500."
