The northern states in the US as well as Canada are good places to grow rhubarb. Check your growing zone to find out if you can grow rhubarb in the climate where you live. Rhubarb grows best in USDA hardiness zones 3-8. This includes much of the northern parts of the Midwest as well as the northeastern regions of the US. Rhubarb wilts during the heat of hot southern summers. If you live in a southern region where it regularly goes above 75 \u00b0F (24 \u00b0C), it will probably be difficult to grow this plant."
