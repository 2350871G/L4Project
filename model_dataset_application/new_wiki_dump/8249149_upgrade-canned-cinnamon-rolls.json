Sprinkle enough brown sugar to cover the dough. This will make more of the gooey filling. Or you could spread a different filling over the unrolled dough.

You could also scatter dried fruit (like raisins or dried cranberries) for a chewy bite. For decadent cinnamon rolls, sprinkle mini-cinnamon or mini-chocolate chips. You could also spread apple pie filling over the unrolled dough. Keep in mind that if you use a lot of extra filling ingredients, it may become difficult to wrap the dough back into a cinnamon roll."

Place the cinnamon roll bites in a greased baking dish and pour the bread pudding mixture over it. Bake the bread pudding for about one hour at 350 degrees F (175 C). You can also divide the bread pudding among smaller ramekins instead of one large baking dish. You may need to reduce the cooking time slightly. Check the ramekins around 20 minutes into baking."

Place one canned cinnamon roll on the iron and close it. Let the cinnamon roll waffle cook for 3 to 4 minutes. It should flatten and cook completely.

Fold the strip of dough in half and twist it around a few times to make a spiral. Bake the cinnamon twists at 350 degrees F (175 C) for 18 to 20 minutes.

Loosely wrap each of the strips around the center piece of dough so you make one large cinnamon roll. Bake the giant roll at 350 degrees F (175 C) for 20 to 25 minutes.
