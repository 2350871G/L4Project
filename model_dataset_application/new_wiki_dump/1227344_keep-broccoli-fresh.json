          "description":"One unconventional but surprisingly effective way to keep your broccoli fresh is similar to the way you might keep a selection of flowers in a bouquet bright and lively. Simply put your head of broccoli, stem down, into a bowl with a half inch or so of water at the bottom. The \"bushy\" part of the broccoli (the head) should point up, out of the bowl. Refrigerate. Storing your broccoli this way should keep it fresh for about five to seven days. For optimum freshness, cover the broccoli head loosely with a plastic bag containing a few holes so that air can pass through. Change the water daily."

Fill a clean, empty spray bottle (one that hasn't previously been filled with bleach or other caustic cleaning products) with cold water, then gently mist your broccoli's heads. Loosely wrap the heads with a paper towel so that the towel absorbs some of the moisture. Keep the broccoli in the fridge. It should remain fresh for about three days. Don't wrap the broccoli too tightly with the paper towels and don't keep it in a sealed container. Broccoli needs air flow to stay fresh."

Simply seal your broccoli in the bag, then poke numerous holes in the bag near the broccoli's head to ensure good air flow. Keep the broccoli refrigerated. The broccoli should stay fresh for at least a few days with this method."

          "description":"When it comes to storing broccoli, a little moisture can be a good thing, but excess moisture can be quite bad. Wetness can promote mold growth in as little as a few days, making a perfectly good head of broccoli inedible. For this reason, you'll want to avoid washing fresh broccoli that you buy from the store, as this has already been washed and dried and thus requires no additional cleaning. However, you will want to wash broccoli that you grow yourself to remove tiny insects and debris from the garden. After washing your homegrown broccoli, be sure to dry it thoroughly to prevent mold. To wash homegrown broccoli, mix warm (not hot) water and a few teaspoons of white vinegar in a large bowl. Soak the broccoli for about 15 minutes to kill any small bugs and remove any debris that may be hiding in the plant's tightly-packed florets. Remove, rinse with cool water, and dry thoroughly before refrigerating."

Some sources recommend that even fresh store-bought broccoli should make it into the refrigerator within 30 minutes of purchase. The quicker your broccoli gets into the fridge, the less of a chance it will have to begin to lose its firm, crisp texture and the longer it will last before going bad."

          "description":"The methods discussed above are great for keeping your broccoli fresh in the short term, but if you have so much broccoli that you don't think you'll be able to eat it all before it goes bad or you simply don't plan on eating it right away, consider freezing it. Frozen broccoli can stay good for over a year, so you'll have plenty of time to incorporate it into your dishes before it goes bad. However, freezing broccoli isn't as simple as tossing it into the freezer and forgetting about it \u2014 first, it has to be prepared in a process called blanching. To start, you'll want to prepare a large pot of boiling water along with a similarly large pot or bowl of ice water."

          "description":"While you're waiting for your water to boil, take the opportunity to use a knife or a pair of kitchen shears to cut the broccoli heads into small chunks. The head pieces should be no more than an inch or so across on any side, with stems no more than an inch or so long. Dividing the broccoli heads into smaller pieces is important \u2014 if you don't do it, the boiling water may blanch the broccoli unevenly by affecting the outer edges of the broccoli more heavily than the protected inner portion. You can even use your bare hands to break up the broccoli heads if you need to. Simply grab pieces of the head and pull them off of the main plant so that you are left with a cluster of florets (the \"bushy\" part) and a short stem. If the florets are more than about an inch and a half across, split the cluster again."

          "description":"When you've separated all of your broccoli bits into separate pieces, dump them into your boiling water to blanch them. They don't need to boil for very long \u2014 about three minutes is plenty. Stir periodically to ensure that the broccoli pieces are evenly blanched. The purpose of blanching is to help preserve the broccoli when it is frozen. All vegetables contain enzymes and bacteria that can cause the color, texture, and taste of the vegetable to become unappetizing during freezing. Blanching kills the bacteria and disables the enzymes, which means that the broccoli will maintain its original delicious properties better after it's frozen."

Then, when the excess hot water has flowed through the colander and poses no danger of burning you, immediately dump them into your ice-cold water. Let them soak in the ice water for about three minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure that all of the pieces come in contact with the cold water. The purpose of the ice water is to immediately cool the broccoli down so that it doesn't continue cooking. The broccoli is boiled to blanch it, not to cook it \u2014 if it's allowed to keep cooking, the broccoli will eventually become soft and unappetizing. Putting hot broccoli pieces directly in the freezer doesn't cool the steaming broccoli down as quickly as the direct contact of ice water, so the latter is a better choice for our purposes."

As it rests, toss the broccoli occasionally to allow trapped moisture to drain. After a minute or two, pat it with a clean rag or paper towel to remove any excess moisture."

Squeeze the excess air out of the bag, seal it, and toss it in the freezer. At this point, you're done! Once it freezes, your broccoli should keep for up to a year. To get the maximum lifetime out of your frozen broccoli, use a low-temperature \"deep freezer\", not a zero-frost freezer, as the latter periodically cycles above freezing to melt the ice in the compartment, which can reduce the life of the broccoli. Specialty vacuum-sealing devices (like the FoodSaver) are great for freezing vegetables. By removing all of the air from the bag or container that the broccoli is stored in, they can extend its freezer life and keep the broccoli fresher than with ordinary freezing methods. However, these devices can cost upwards of $100. For many recipes (especially baking recipes), you won't want to defrost vegetables before cooking, as this can throw off the moisture content of the final dish. However, for recipes that call for defrosted broccoli, all you need to do to do is soak the broccoli in room temperature water for a few minutes to thaw it."

Whether you're picking out your broccoli at the local supermarket or pulling it fresh from your garden, it's a smart idea to know the signs of a fresh, healthy plant so that you can consistently choose the best broccoli. To start, try examining the small, beady buds making up the head of the broccoli \u2014 these are called \"florets\".

Generally, for the best-tasting, freshest broccoli, you'll want to harvest during the coolest part of the day (usually the morning). Cut the entire broccoli head from the plant at its stem and immediately transfer into the refrigerator to preserve its freshness.
