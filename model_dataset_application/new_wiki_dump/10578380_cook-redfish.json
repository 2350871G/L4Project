Press 1 teaspoon (0.8 g) of fresh, chopped thyme and 1 tablespoon (2.6 g) of fresh, chopped basil into the flesh side of the fish only. If you don't have fresh herbs, add a sprinkling of dried herbs, such as 1 teaspoon (0.5 g) of basil or rosemary, 1 teaspoon (1 g) of thyme, or 1 teaspoon (0.6 g) of rosemary. Italian seasoning in similar measurements would also work."

The fish is done when it flakes easily with a fork. Serve the fish with a side of rice or saut\u00e9ed spinach. You could add a pat of butter or a squeeze of lemon on top of the fish at the end."

Make sure the grill is very clean before you put the fish down, as it will stick if it's not. Rub oil across the grill to keep the fish from sticking.
