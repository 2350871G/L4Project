The two won\u2019t combine properly until the sugar dissolves in the water, which will happen when you add heat. To increase your simple syrup yield, increase the amount of sugar and water you use, sticking with the one-to-one ratio."

When the syrup starts to boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer it for three minutes. While the sugar will eventually dissolve in cold water, this can take hours or days to occur. Moreover, if you don\u2019t add heat to the mixture, none of the water will boil off, so the syrup won\u2019t be as thick."
