          "description":"Add 1 egg white and \u215b teaspoon (\u00bd g) cream of tartar to the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Whip the mixture on medium until stiff peaks form, which should take approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Set the mixture aside. It\u2019s best to use a stand mixer to make the nougat center filling for the pecan log roll. A handheld electric mixer may not be strong enough for the heavy texture of the candy. To separate the egg white, crack an egg against a flat surface, such as a countertop or table. Pry the halves apart over a bowl, and let the yolk fall into the lower half. Move the yolk back and forth between the shell halves while allowing the white to drip out into the bowl below. When you\u2019ve let all the white drip out, set the yolk aside for use in another recipe and add the white to your stand mixer bowl."

Place the pan on the stove, and heat the mixture on medium, stirring it constantly with a wooden spoon until the sugar dissolves, which should take approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Make sure to stir the mixture gently to avoid splashing it against the sides of the saucepan."

          "description":"After the sugar has dissolved, place a lid on the pan. Allow the mixture to cook on medium for another 3 to 4 minutes while covered. This will create condensation to wash away any sugar crystals that may have gotten stuck to the sides of the pan."

Raise the heat to medium-high to bring the mixture to a boil, and heat the pan until the mixture reaches 255 degrees Fahrenheit (123 degrees Celsius) on a candy thermometer. For best results, use a candy thermometer with a metal clamp that secures it to the side of your pan. If you don\u2019t have a candy thermometer, you can use the cold water test. Place a drop of the syrup in a glass of cold water. Remove it from the water after several seconds -- it should form a firm but pliable ball."

Slowly pour the hot syrup into the bowl to mix them. The egg whites will double in volume. Be careful when you\u2019re pouring the syrup into the egg whites. The mixture will be extremely hot, and can easily burn your skin."
