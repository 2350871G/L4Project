It is imperative that you use chocolate with 70% cocoa solids, or the other ingredients in the chocolate will prevent it from attaining a mousse-like texture. Don't use chocolate chips for this recipe. They often come with a waxy coating that will throw off the chemistry of the dish. Since the chocolate flavor is so strong in this recipe, buy the best-tasting chocolate bar you can find. Shave the chocolate. Use a microplane or cheese grater to shave the chocolate until it becomes a fine pile of powdery chocolate shavings. Get it as fine as possible so that it will melt quickly when you mix it with warm water. Fill a large bowl with ice. Use plenty of ice, since you'll need to get the chocolate nice and cold. Place a smaller bowl inside the larger bowl, making sure the ice rises up the sides of the smaller bowl. Heat a cup of water on the stove. Place the water in a small saucepan and heat it over medium heat on the stove. If you want to flavor your chocolate with vanilla, remove a teaspoon of water from the saucepan and add a teaspoon of vanilla. You can add cayenne pepper, orange extract,or other spices or extracts to the water to flavor the chocolate. Making the Mousse Add the chocolate shavings to the saucepan. Use a whisk to begin stirring the shavings immediately. They will melt and combine with the water to form a liquidy mixture. Continue whisking until the chocolate is entirely melted. Pour the chocolate into the small iced bowl. Turn off the stove and carefully pour the chocolate into the bowl that's sitting inside the bowl of ice. Whisk the chocolate vigorously.
