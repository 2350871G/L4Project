Invite your friends over to watch a television event, or throw a house party for someone\u2019s birthday or a holiday. When you throw a house party focused on a specific event it\u2019s easy to base the theme off of this as well. Have a Superbowl party for everyone to watch this year\u2019s Superbowl game. Theme your decorations and food on football or the teams playing in the Superbowl. Throw a house party for a friend\u2019s birthday or for a holiday like New Year\u2019s Eve. Invite a group of friends over to watch an award show like the Oscars. Create an elegant feel by using the colors black, white, and gold for your party."

          "description":"The amount of people you have at your party will determine the feel of your party. If you only have a few guests the party will be much more intimate and lend itself to more in depth conversations. However, if you have lots of guests the party will have a different vibe. A party with a lot of people is a great way for people to make new friends and tends to have lighter conversations. The amount of space you have in your home will also determine how many guests to invite. You don\u2019t want a house that is so crowded that people can\u2019t move around easily. You need about 8-12 square feet per person for a comfortable cocktail party, and about 5-8 square feet per person for a comfortable larger party. To figure out how many people you should invite, divide the number of square feet in the part of your house the party will take place by the number of square feet per person you want to use."

You should send your invitation out several weeks in advance so your friends can plan to attend the party. There are many different online companies that let you pick an invitation and send it to your friends\u2019 email addresses. Many of these invitations are designed to look just like paper invitations so they can match your theme. They also let you track your invitation and give guests an easy way to R.S.V.P."

You should also include other important details like your contact information for people to R.S.V.P. or get in touch with you if they have a question. Anything that you want your guest to bring should also be included on the invitation. If you want your guests to leave at a certain time, you should include an end time on the invitation. Another important detail to include is if there is a dress code. If you want your guests to dress in a certain attire make sure you indicate this on the invitation. An example of this would be if you want your guests to dress in a costume matching the theme of your party."

You should have adequate lighting in the entrance to welcome guests as they arrive. The main area the guests will be in should have lower lighting to create an intimate environment. A space where party guests will be dancing should have very low lighting or lit with party lights like black lights and glow sticks. Different kinds of lights can create a different vibe so think about the type of party you want when picking your lighting. Candles and fancy lamps can create an intimate, upscale feel.

You can hang posters and banners to decorate for the party. Have centerpieces on all of your tables the reflect the parties theme or vibe. Use items you already have as decorations.
