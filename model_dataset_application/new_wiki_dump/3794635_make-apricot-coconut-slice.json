  "text":" Preparing the Mixture Sift the flours in a large mixing bowl.  Stir in the coconut, sugar and butter. Mix these ingredients together well. Spoon the mixture into a Swiss roll pan. The pan should be lined with baking paper or pre-greased to prevent sticking. Distribute the mixture evenly with the back of a large spoon, making sure that it is level and reaches into the corners of the pan.  Baking the Slice Bake at 180\u00baC/350\u00baF for 12 minutes or until lightly browned.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Set the tray atop a wire cake rack to allow airflow for cooling. Drain the apricots and put the syrup or juice to one side. Mash the apricots into a thick pulp. Spread the mashed apricots over the top of the baked slice. Again, be sure to level out the apricot layer. Make the topping. Combine the topping ingredients together in a small bowl and mix well. Sprinkle the topping mixture over the apricot layer.  Return to the oven at 180\u00baC/350\u00baF for another 25 minutes.  Making the Slice Bars Remove from the oven and cool sitting on a wire cake rack.  Cut into squares or rectangular slices. In other words, aim to cut them into the same shape as muesli or granola bars. Finished. ",
