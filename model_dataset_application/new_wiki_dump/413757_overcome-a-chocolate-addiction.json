          "description":"To help you understand your chocolate addiction so that you can overcome it, try to first identify when you started to increase your intake and rely on chocolate. While you may have always enjoyed eating chocolate, consider what was going on in your life when you started exhibiting the signs of addiction, such as intense cravings, inability to overcome or control your cravings, and continuing to eat chocolate despite experiencing negative consequences. Addictions often emerge as a side effect or consequence of another issue. For example, you might identify that you started eating chocolate until it made you feel sick right after you lost your job. You can then begin to understand the impetus for your addiction, which is an important step in mentally overcoming your chocolate addiction."

          "description":"If you don\u2019t eat chocolate because it makes you genuinely happy, you might be using chocolate to compensate for another feeling. There are all sorts of reasons why people crave foods, many of which are related to negative emotions. If you can identify your reasons for overindulging, you can then figure out a course of action for tackling the problem. To help you figure out why you rely on chocolate, try to pause for a few moments and pay attention to your feelings the next time you find yourself reaching for something chocolatey. Ask yourself whether you want to eat the chocolate because you simply want to briefly enjoy the taste, or whether you want the chocolate because you are sad, upset, anxious, or feeling any other emotion that is driving your desire. In other words, practice mindfulness when you eat chocolate. This will help you become more aware of your addiction, and help you identify what type of help you need to overcome your addiction."

Therefore, it can be helpful to keep a daily log of when you get a craving, when you indulge, and how much chocolate you eat in each instance. This can help you not only be honest with yourself about your addiction, but also help bring to light any patterns in your cravings and chocolate consumption. For example, after keeping track for several months, you may find that you crave and indulge in chocolate much more frequently during a particular time of year. As a result, your addiction may be a side effect of seasonal depression. You may find, for example, that your chocolate addiction is worse during your period, or during times of emotional, psychological, or physical stress."

As a result, it can be helpful to talk to a healthcare professional to better understand the cause of your addiction, and to create a plan for overcoming it. Mental healthcare professionals can help you better understand your addiction and deal with the underlying cause, which can in turn help you overcome your addiction. Your family physician or a nutritionist can help you understand the physical impact of your addiction on your body, and help you create a food and exercise plan that can both diminish your cravings and help reverse the negative effects on your body."

Dark chocolate has more health benefits than white or milk chocolate, making it a healthier option. The health benefits of chocolate are derived from its cocoa content. Milk and white chocolate have less cocoa than dark chocolate because of additives like milk and sugar. Cocoa is a high in flavonoid antioxidants, which can help fight heart disease, improve vascular function, and lower blood pressure. In addition, because dark chocolate is less sweet and more rich, you\u2019ll be less likely to overindulge."

If your body is in need of magnesium, it may be contributing to your overwhelming chocolate cravings. When you swap out chocolate for other high-magnesium foods, your chocolate cravings may start to subside. Magnesium is an essential nutrient that helps your body regulate muscle and nerve function, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure. Taking magnesium can be particularly helpful in curbing chocolate cravings during your period."

For example, if you\u2019re having a bad day and feel an overwhelming urge to indulge, try calling a friend to help cheer you up instead of indulging in chocolate. After talking to a friend that makes you happy, you\u2019ll likely feel better and have less of an urge to eat chocolate.
