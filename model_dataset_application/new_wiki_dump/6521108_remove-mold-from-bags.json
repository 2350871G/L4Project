          "description":"Fill a bowl with water and squirt dish soap or hand soap into the water. Stir the water and soap together until soap bubbles form. You can use as much or as little soap as you\u2019d like, but using roughly 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of dish or hand soap should work well."

          "description":"Pour clean water into a small bowl before adding baking soda to the water in small increments. Add a spoonful at a time, mixing it together thoroughly. Once you\u2019ve created a paste, your mixture is ready to be used. It\u2019s best for the paste to be more watery than solid to make spreading it onto the bag easier."

          "description":"Dilute the vinegar by using 1 part vinegar and 1 part water, or use pure white vinegar as a stronger cleaner. Mix the water and vinegar in a bowl to get it ready for use. To dilute the vinegar even more, use 1 part white vinegar and 2 parts water. This works well on leather and canvas, as well as things made of synthetic materials like backpacks."

Dip the toothbrush in your chosen cleaning liquid once it\u2019s properly mixed. Tap the toothbrush on the edge of the bowl to prevent it from dripping, if desired. If you don\u2019t have an old toothbrush to use, purchase a cheap new one or use a clean cloth instead."

Dip your toothbrush back in the liquid after you clean one section to remove the mold from the toothbrush and apply more cleaner. Scrub the bag using the toothbrush until the mold is completely gone. Clean the entire surface of the bag to make sure you get rid of any possible mold spores."

Swipe the cloth over each cleaned section of your bag to get rid of the extra cleaner that\u2019s still on the bag. Rinse out your cloth and re-wet it after every couple of swipes to make sure you\u2019re not putting cleaning liquid back onto the bag."

If you can't flip it inside out, simply open it up as far as it will go and clean it with the toothbrush just like you did the exterior.
