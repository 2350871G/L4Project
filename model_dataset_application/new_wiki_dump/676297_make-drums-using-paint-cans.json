      "description":"To make this drum kit, you will need a cardboard box, three small paint cans and two large paint cans. Try to make the large paint cans tall rather than wide. If you can't find any tall paint cans, make the small paint cans much shorter. Make sure they're not too short though or it won't make any sound. Also, the cardboard box needs to fit all five paint cans on like the picture below."

      "description":"To set up the drums, put the three short paint cans (black circles) in a row towards the bottom of the cardboard box. These will represent the snare drum, mid tom and floor tom. Next, put the two tall paint cans (red circles) in between paint cans one and two, and two and three. These will represent the high hat and another cymbal such as a crash, splash or ride."

    {
      "headline":"Fill the cymbals with rice.",
      "description":"When you strike the drums, the rice will rattle inside making it sound like a cymbal. Put about an eighth of rice in the high-hat cymbal can and about a quarter of rice in the other cymbal paint can. Other things you can fill the drum with include broken up spaghetti, crushed pasta and something similar. Make sure the spaghetti or pasta is uncooked otherwise it will go bad and smell/sound awful"

      "headline":"Glue the drums in place.",
      "description":"To glue the drums in place, put a layer of hot glue (yellow line) on the edge of the drum. Be sure to take the lids off the drums before gluing them so the sound echos better once you're finished. Also, using hot glue will secure the drums fully to the box whereas any other glue might come off after time. If you don't have hot glue, use other glue at your own risk."
