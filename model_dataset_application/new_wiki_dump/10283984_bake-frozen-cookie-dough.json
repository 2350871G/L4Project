When you\u2019re ready to slice and bake cookies from it, give it 10-15 minutes on the counter to defrost a bit. Even better, let it defrost for 1-2 hours in the fridge. This slight defrosting will make the log easier to slice and less likely to crumble. A slight thaw is all you need.

Simply add a couple minutes to the estimated baking time. Add just a little time to account for the still-frozen centers of the cookie rounds.

You\u2019ll usually be instructed to mix the dough and work it into a log shape by hand, aiming for a log with a diameter equal to those of the cookies you want to bake.
