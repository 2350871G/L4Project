Consider some risers. For a small amount, you can buy risers that go under each leg of your bed. They raise it further off the floor, allowing you to store larger items underneath. Some tubs, bins, or baskets can help you make the most of the space under the bed, keeping your possessions organized. You can also install drawers under your bed. You can use the drawers of an old dresser, or you can buy a bed with drawers already installed. This can be a great place to store clothes, shoes, or small knickknacks. Alternatively, if you don't need to store anything under your bed, it can be a good idea to choose one that is low to the ground.
