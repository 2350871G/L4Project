      "headline":"Choose a character.",
      "description":"One of the biggest aspects of Tekken is their large character selection. In Tekken 7 there are a total of thirty-six characters, excluding DLC. So, the first thing you will want to do is find a character that you connect with whether it be aesthetics or a certain move you like."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Learn 3D movement.",
      "description":"Once you have found a character that you can relate with, you will want to work on movement. Tekken is a 3D fighter, meaning that you can move around the whole arena, you are not confined to just walking back and forth. Press up or down twice in quick succession to sidestep. You should familiarize yourself with back dashing and side stepping (stepping into the background/foreground) these movements will help you avoid incoming attacks and punish missed moves. As for blocking, you automatically block incoming attacks unless they are low then you simple crouch. You can always hold back to make sure the character blocks. There are also moves associated with movement, such as tackles or shoulders when you dash fullscreen. Another move is a low parry, where all you have to do is press down forward while crouching when they hit you with a low attack."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Memorize basic combos.",
      "description":"After you are familiarized with movement you should start to work on basic combos. There is specific move list for each character in the game. You can enter practice mode to access this menu, the game will allow you to have one move on the screen while you play. There are around one hundred moves for each character, so there is a lot to practice."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Start to create a juggle combo.",
      "description":"Now that you have your movements and basic combos down, you can work on simple juggles. A juggle is a continued string of moves that can deal massive amounts of damage. To start a juggle you first need to learn the launchers for your character. Launchers throw the opponent into the air then you can do the combos you learned previously to do more damage. There are also screw moves which cause opponents to spin through the air which you can use to make your combos longer."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Understand the chain grapples/grapples.",
      "description":"Another area that you should familiarize yourself with is grapples. After you block enough of your opponent's moves, they will usually go for a grapple, but don't worry as they can be reversed with practice. Throws are a huge part of Tekken and can deal fair amounts of damage if not broken. basic throws are performed by pressing two buttons at the same time, for instance 1 + 3 and 2 + 4.These buttons vary depending on what platform you are playing the game on. These throws are broken by pressing 1 or 2 depending on which side the throw was initiated from. Most characters have what are called command throws, which are broken by pressing 1 and 2 at the same time. There are also chain throws with some characters (such as King and Dragunov) that can take half your health bar away if not broken, so try to learn those sooner rather than later."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Time rage arts and rage drives.",
      "description":"Two new mechanics have been introduced into Tekken 7, the rage art and the rage drive. These special moves can be activated when you are low on health and can change the whole course of the match. Rage arts are cinematic finisher moves which cause roughly 30% of the opponents health bar and rage drives are powered normal moves which often initiate combo opportunities. Using other of these moves will cause you to lose rage, so use them wisely! When you are low on health your character starts to glow red this means you are in rage, when in rage you do extra damage and have access to these special moves. The lower your characters health is the more damage rage arts do."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use power crushes.",
      "description":"Another new mechanic added in Tekken 7 are power crushes. these are moves that each character has that allows you to power through your opponent's attacks, but you will still take the damage."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Learn wall combos.",
      "description":"Like most fighting games, Tekken has walls, and that means opportunities massive amounts of damage. Wall splats are one of the most useful tools in fighting games, the wall will let you trap your opponent and drag your combos on longer. Each character has their own moves that work well with this mechanic and learning those moves will make you exponentially better. The best things for learning said moves is watching guides on youtube pertaining to your specific character."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Find the punishes.",
      "description":"In Tekken you can also punish your opponent. A punish is when you block, side step, or parry a move and get a combo off of it. All the moves in Tekken have different rates of recovery, so with learning the game through experience you will be able to find when those opportunities arise and profit from them."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Be aware of positioning/wall carries.",
      "description":"One last thing to take into consideration when playing is wall carries/the location of your character and the wall. As mentioned previously wall combos can do massive amounts of damage and can win you the game. There are some strings that carry your opponent farther across the stage towards the wall. Learning these moves will help you get that wall damage you need to finish off your opponent."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Try online matches.",
      "description":"Once you have taken all the previous steps into consideration and are more comfortable with the game, move on to online matches. Practice mode and AIs can only get you so far, eventually you will have to move onto the real deal. Unfortunately there is no set way to play this game, so every match you play will be unique and you will have to react quickly if you want to succeed. Movement is much more important in online matches, the ai tends to want to have a poke war up close, it can be an awkward adjustment."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Practice, practice, practice.",
      "description":"Just like most things in life, practice makes perfect. Obviously, the more you play the game the better you will get. Unfortunately there is no shortcut, so no matter how discouraging it might be just keep pushing through and practice. After playing the game long enough you will be able to see character moves and know when to punish them or where you need to block."
