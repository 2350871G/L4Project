Dealers won\u2019t mind as long as you don\u2019t slow down the game.

This initial bet has a house edge of about 1.4%, and you're basically betting on the results of the shooter's first roll. If the shooter rolls a total of 7 or 11, you win even money. A total of 2, 3, or 12 means you lose. But a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 means you move on to more rounds."

It's a bet that the shooter's first roll (the \u201cpoint\u201d) will get rolled again before they roll a 7. You can also bet on the 7 coming first, but that\u2019s a less popular choice since you\u2019re winning when the other players are losing. You can also place a \u201ccome bet,\u201d which establishes another \u201cpoint\u201d in the game, and also has a low house edge. Avoid sucker bets (placing a bet that a specific number, like 6 or 8, will pop up before the point) as these have a significant house edge."

Look for a game with a good pay table, which will show a full house and a flush paying out 9 and 6, respectively, rather than 8 and 5. Games where the full house and flush pay out 8 and 5 have lower return percentages. You want a game where the return is as close to 100% as possible to reduce the cut that the house is taking."
