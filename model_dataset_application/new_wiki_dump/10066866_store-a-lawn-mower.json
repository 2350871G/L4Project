          "description":"Condensation inside the fuel tank can seriously damage the mower's engine: if moisture develops, it can cause corrosion, clogs, and other problems. Having an empty tank before your mower is put into storage lowers the risk of condensation forming. Start up your mower, and let it run until it no longer starts back up, and the fuel lines are empty. Keeping fuel inside the mower is also a fire hazard. Do not jeopardize the safety of yourself, your property, and others."

As long as the spark plug is connected, there is a risk of the mower accidentally kick-starting. To avoid this possibility and prevent serious injury, it is strongly recommended to remove the spark plug or the spark plug lead wire. Remove the spark plug only after thoroughly draining your mower of fuel. This greatly reduces the possibility of an accidental start."

Upon removal, clean the battery with a cloth, and store it in a cool, dry place. To lower the risk of an accidental fire, always keep the mower's battery away from fuel, sources of heat, and anything that has a pilot light."
