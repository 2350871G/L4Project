This will include your plants, plant containers, furniture, equipment, visitors, and weather loads like snow. Contact a structural engineer to discuss your roof garden and how much your roof can handle. A structural engineer can also advise you in preliminary designs for your garden and how to work around possible obstructions (like chimneys). Business search sites like Yelp or Angie's List can help you find a local engineer. Make sure the engineer you contact is licensed (a legal requirement in many countries, particularly the United States)."

Your area might have restrictions on your garden's height, how you use your roof space, and whether certain decorations are too distracting. If you are renting your house, contact your landlord to get permission before constructing your rooftop garden. If you live in a building that is part of a historical neighborhood, you will need to contact the district leaders to find out if there are any additional regulations."

Note sunlight patterns over a period of 1 or 2 weeks to make sure your roof's sunlight isn't obscured by other buildings. Try monitoring the sun in the morning, midday, and evening so you have an accurate sense of how exposure changed throughout the day."

          "description":"Wind is usually stronger on the rooftop than on ground level, especially if your building is several stories high. Too much wind can greatly damage or even kill plants. Structural windbreakers (like trellises) may be necessary if you notice strong winds on your roof. You can monitor wind exposure with a weather vane, with a anemometer, or by standing on the roof and experiencing the weather for yourself. Because wind can dry out soil, your plants will need frequent watering."

          "description":"Using graph or blueprint paper, make a rough sketch of your garden and plot out where you want to put plants and furniture. This will keep your rooftop organized as you begin building your garden. If you change your mind about something, you can always go back and redesign it. To keep the sketch to scale, decide beforehand how much space each square on the graphing paper will represent (e.g. 1 foot or meter). Approximate the overall size of your roof or measure it yourself, then base the drawing on your measurement."

Seedlings with these qualities will be more likely to survive the first year. Add shade or windbreakers if you plan to add more fragile plants. Ornamental grasses, honeysuckles, and magnolias all do well in hot, sunny weather. Make sure you regularly water your plants, even those that are drought-resistant."

If harsh winds or heat hits, your plants will be much more likely to survive. Decorate the garden with bird- or butterfly feeders to attract more animals. Ask your local nursery which plants are native to your area for your options."

Trim your trees' roots every few years to keep them at a manageable size.
