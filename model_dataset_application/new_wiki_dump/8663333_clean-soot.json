          "description":"Take the soot-stained fabric outdoors and gently shake off any excess soot. Be careful not to shake too vigorously so that you don\u2019t make the stain bigger or spread the soot around any more than is necessary. If you shake the fabric too vigorously, you also risk grinding the soot into the fabric \u2013 ultimately making it harder to clean."

          "description":"For fabrics stained with soot, try rinsing them with cold water to remove the stain. Turn the fabric inside out and run it under cool water to get as much of the soot out as possible. Try not to spread the stain further or grind the soot into the fabric with your hands. Try to let the cold water do its job and avoid touching the soot during the process."

          "description":"If you have soot stains on fabric materials like clothing, you can try soaking them overnight in laundry detergent. Fill a bucket with warm water and a small amount of laundry detergent and submerge the items. Let the fabric soak for at least six hours. If the soot-stained items can be bleached without being ruined, add a few drops of bleach to the detergent/water mixture."

          "headline":"Wash the fabric in hot water.",
          "description":"Use the hottest possible setting on your laundry machine to wash the soot-stained fabric. Use bleach (or color safe bleach, if the fabric requires it) when you run the washing machine. Make sure that you have done all you can to minimize the soot stain before you actually wash the fabric. Using several methods together will be much more effective at removing the stain than just attempting one method. Don\u2019t put the fabric in the dryer until you have checked to make sure the soot stain was completely removed. Otherwise, this could permanently set the stain in the fabric."

Be sure that you completely cover the stain with the baking soda. Let the baking soda sit for fifteen minutes and then vacuum it up. You can also use cornstarch as an alternative for baking soda."

Don\u2019t press the vacuum hose nozzle directly up against the soot-stained fabric, as this could cause the soot to fly everywhere and create an even bigger mess. For most fabrics or upholstery, you should try to vacuum up as much of the soot as possible first.

Simply spray some of the cleaner on the sponge and wipe the soot away. You will need to rinse the sponge periodically so you don\u2019t just keep transferring the soot stains as you clean.
