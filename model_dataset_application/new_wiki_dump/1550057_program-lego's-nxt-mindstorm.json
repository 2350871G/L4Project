Unchecking \"Wait for Completion\" allows the robot to begin executing the next commands in your program before completing the motion controlled by the Motor operation. This can allow your robot, for instance, to move and shoot at the same time. The Motor command will execute any operation performed by the motor it controls.

For example, to have your robot to examine a bunch of balls until it finds a yellow one, simply create a loop controlled by the color sensor. The actions inside the loop will be those to examine the next ball; the control on the loop will be that the color sensor does not detect yellow. Thus when the color sensor, after examining a ball, detects yellow, it will stop examining new balls and move on to the next step of the program."

These two series of actions are mutually exclusive in the switch: the robot will perform one but not the other. Nest one switch inside another to check for multiple conditions before performing an action. For instance, use nested switches to have your robot move forward if it detects neither light nor sound. The first switch will check for light; if light is not detected, the robot will enter the second switch, which checks for sound. Only if sound is not detected (after the light has not been detected) will the robot move forward. To include more than one case in a switch controlled by a value, uncheck \"Flat view\" in the settings for the switch and, on the right side of the settings where it lists the conditions, press \"+\" to add another case. This is useful when the control is a number or text message whose value can be more than two different things."

Add cases for the exact input of a number or text variable. For instance, have your robot execute a series of commands if the number variable is 0, different commands if it's 1, and yet another set of commands in case it's any other number. Loops can also be controlled by time -- the statements inside will run for a certain amount of time -- or count -- the whole loop will run through a certain number of times.

This command allows for creativity and flexibility in your robot's performance; take advantage of it. Use sensors to allow your robot to interact with its environment. Hook up ultrasonic, touch, and color sensors to the intelligent chip's ports, and use them to sense light, color, sound, and touch. Your robot can also keep track of time and rotation. These sensors allow your program to perform actions only when they are activated. For instance, you could have a program say \"Red\" when it detects the color red, but not when it detects the color blue. Use action operations to get your robot to perform actions. These can include turning on or off a colored light, playing sound from a sound file, displaying an image or text on the intelligent brick's screen, or sending a message over Bluetooth. Using Loops and Switches Understand how loops work. Loops allow you to perform a series of commands repeatedly, either indefinitely, for a set number of times, while a certain condition is true, or until a certain action happens. For example, to have your robot to examine a bunch of balls until it finds a yellow one, simply create a loop controlled by the color sensor. The actions inside the loop will be those to examine the next ball; the control on the loop will be that the color sensor does not detect yellow. Thus when the color sensor, after examining a ball, detects yellow, it will stop examining new balls and move on to the next step of the program. Understand how switches work. A switch statement tells your robot to perform one series of commands if a certain condition is true and a different series of actions if that condition is not true. These two series of actions are mutually exclusive in the switch: the robot will perform one but not the other. Nest one switch inside another to check for multiple conditions before performing an action. For instance, use nested switches to have your robot move forward if it detects neither light nor sound. The first switch will check for light; if light is not detected, the robot will enter the second switch, which checks for sound. Only if sound is not detected (after the light has not been detected) will the robot move forward. To include more than one case in a switch controlled by a value, uncheck \"Flat view\" in the settings for the switch and, on the right side of the settings where it lists the conditions, press \"+\" to add another case. This is useful when the control is a number or text message whose value can be more than two different things. Drop a loop or switch into your program and choose the control. This will set the condition the robot will check for before performing the commands inside the switch or loop. Usually, the control will be a sensor. This allows your robot to interact closely with its environment. Switches can also be controlled by a value. Attach a variable to the leading edge of the switch using a data wire. Add cases for the exact input of a number or text variable. For instance, have your robot execute a series of commands if the number variable is 0, different commands if it's 1, and yet another set of commands in case it's any other number. Loops can also be controlled by time -- the statements inside will run for a certain amount of time -- or count -- the whole loop will run through a certain number of times. Choose Logic to have the loop run until a certain condition becomes true or false, or Forever to have the robot perform those commands indefinitely. Drag other commands inside the loop or switch. Any operations that you put inside a loop will be performed every time the loop runs through. Operations that you place in each case of a switch will be performed if that case is met. Place and configure these operations as normal. You can include loops and switches inside other loops and switches, if you so desire. Using Variables Understand the use of variables. Variables can store information so that you can access it later in the program. Think of them as a box into which you put certain information. You can later remove or change that information without changing the box -- the variable -- itself. Each variable can store a number, a string of text, or a logic value (true or false). You can freely change the value of a variable, but you can't change its type. Each variable has a unique name. Use this name to access and refer to the variable. Create a variable by going to Edit \u2192 Define Variables. In the window that pops up, enter the name of your variable and choose your desired datatype (logic, number, or text). You can also delete variables you no longer need. Give your variables descriptive names so that you can keep track of what they are.

Use variables in your program by connecting them to commands using data wires. Connect them to math operations to combine variables or set them to the result. Connect them to loops or switches to use them as the control, and even modify them inside the loop or switch. Use constants for variables that will never change. If you want a text variable for the name of your robot, set it at the beginning by going to Edit \u2192 Define Constants. Then you can refer to this constant without worrying about it being changed. Using Custom Blocks Understand how custom blocks can be useful. Create a custom block for a series of two or more operations that you repeat several times throughout your program. For example, if you want your robot to move forward for three seconds and then flash a red light, include these instructions in a custom block so that you can access them quickly and easily each time you need to include them in the program. Lay out the series of operations that will become your custom block. Include them in your program just as you normally would. Select the instructions you want to make your custom block.
