  "text":" Foundation Points Trace the foundation template onto greaseproof paper or thin sew-in interfacing.  Place a piece of red fabric RS up on the foundation and put a piece of cream RS down onto it. Pin exactly on the line and fold the cream fabric back. Is it covering the outer lines? If not then reposition or cut a larger piece and try again. Sew from the back exactly on the line, extend a couple of stitches past the end of the line and use a smaller stitch than usual. Press open. Repeat for the other cream piece and press well. Remove the papers if using. Make four foundation blocks for each fight block you are making. Our version has matching fabrics but you could mix and match if you wanted. Basic Block Carefully cut five 3-3\u20444in squares pieces from the dark red fabric.  Lay the squares and foundation units in position following the layout shown in Figure 2.  Finally piece the squares into rows and join to make one complete block.  Variation One Cut: Two 2-1\u20442in squares in dark red, cut in half on the diagonal. Four 3-3\u20444in squares of dark red. One 2-3\u20444in square in cream for centre. Sew two triangles to opposite sides of the cream square and press open. Repeat for the other two sides. Lay out and piece into a block.  Variation Three Cut: Eight 2- 1\u20442in squares in cream Ten 2-1\u20442in squares in dark red. Cut two in half on the diagonal for the centre unit\nOne 2-3\u20444in square in cream for centre. Take the cream 2-1\u20442in squares and draw a line on the diagonal on the WS. Pair the squares RS together with a dark red square and sew 1\u20444in away from the line on both sides. Cut apart along the line and press open. These are half square triangle units. Reposition. Piece the half square triangle units into blocks of four with all the triangles pointing the same way as shown in the pictures. Make the centre unit as in variation one and join into one block.  Assembly and Quilting Add Strips. Measure the length of your table and add narrow sashing strips between the blocks if needed to bring the length to match your table. Or you may need some extra blocks. Cut a piece of backing fabric and wadding 1 1\u20442in larger all round than your finished top. Lay the backing WS up on the table and place the wadding and then the top RS up onto it. Pin or tack together. Quilt as needed. This top was quilted on the Super quilter using a monofilament thread and has vermicelli quilting on the red squares and a diamond pattern inside the diamonds. The cream areas were left unquilted. If you had less time for quilting you could just quilt in the ditch between the blocks. Add binding cut to required length. Hanging Triangles Cut 24 Triangles. Using the template cut twenty four triangles in the red fabrics with a seam allowance and twelve pieces of wadding without seam allowance. Sew pairs of triangles RS together leaving about 1 1\u20442in on a straight edge to turn through. Turn the right way out and poke the corners out. slip the wadding inside and ladder stitch the gap closed. Join the triangles together at the corners only using a large bead. Sew six small shirt buttons to the ends of the table runner on the WS and sew six corresponding button loops to the top row of triangles. Add tassels by threading through the large bead and adding a string of bugle and seed beads. End by passing through a large bead, a seed bead and then back up round the seed bead, back through the large bead and finally through the string of beads. Complete by sewing through a few times in the seam allowance. Make three of varying lengths for each end of the runner. Lay in pride of place on your table.",
