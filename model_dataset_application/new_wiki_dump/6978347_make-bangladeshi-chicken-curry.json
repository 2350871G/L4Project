Then cut each of those into smaller slices no wider than a 1/4\" thick. The cucumber will be going on the side of the dish to give it a cooling effect (because the curry will be spicy) and a fresh aspect.

When that half of the red onion is chopped, slide it all onto a paper plate and set aside for now. Separate the tomatoes, cucumbers, and red onions because we don't all like the same stuff on our bowls of curry; so this way no one complains. If you like all of it you can just go ahead and mix in the cucumbers, tomatoes, and diced red onions together and toss it in with your curry when you're ready to eat."

Then drain out the water, add more hot water, swish around, drain and keep doing this over and over until you see the water is becoming clear.

Cooking the Curry Pour the oil into a large metal pot that has been sitting on the burner for a few minutes. The second you see the oil smoke toss in your whole spices (cinnamon, peppercorns, cloves, bay leaves, and cardamom). Stir them around a bit until they become fragrant. When you can smell the lovely aroma of the whole spices toss in all of the chopped onions (red and yellow) and stir to coat with oil.
