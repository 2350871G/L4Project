Assume that they will also need to work around their own schedules. Don't tell them to come \"sometime\" if you really want them to show up. Tell them specifically when to come so that it feels more like an invitation. A range of times is also okay, but it should be no longer than a few hours. If your guests show up late, try to make them feel welcome. Do not sulk for the rest of the evening, or you may compound the problem. Just continue laughing and ignore the fact they were late. Telling your guests in advance is just a matter of courtesy. If they know what to expect, it will be much easier for them to plan their schedules around it."

Always contact them beforehand and ask if they have any allergies or food specifications. Inviting a vegetarian over for dinner and preparing a roast would be embarrassing for both of you. Be sure to cook something that you're comfortable cooking. Don't just say, \"Do you have any preference for the meal?\" Instead, ask your guests to name specifics. Say, \"I'm planning the meal for Friday night. Do you have any allergies or food restrictions that I need to be aware of?\" Don't go out of your way to prepare a main course which takes days to make.

Remove allergens by vacuuming carpets, rugs, and upholstered furniture. If you have a dog that tends to greet, bark at or jump on guests when they come through the door, put it in another room. Some people are scared of dogs and intimidated even by their approach. Some are allergic. If you have pets, find out beforehand whether your guests have any fears or allergies.

If you still have things to prepare, engage with your guests whilst organizing what you have left. By now, you should have finished tidying the area, so that you have only the food to finish. Have your family or a housemate engage the guests so that you can finish preparing the rest of the food. Keep finger food on the coffee table in the living room to whet everyone's appetites.

If you are hosting family or close friends\u2014people that you know and trust\u2014you may invite them to feel at home in your space. If you are hosting a stranger (say, through AirBnB or Couchsurfing.org), you should still be a courteous host, but it may a greater risk to give them the sort of access that you'd give your family. If you're hosting an AirBnB guest, you may not be around the house when they're around. You may even be away on a trip. Make sure to leave plenty of notes around to help your guests understand the way you want things done."

You may also simply coordinate breakfast plans with your guest at night before you go to sleep. Make sure to mention what's on the menu for breakfast. If your guest doesn't like eating breakfast or doesn't want to rise early, you have several options: invite her to use your kitchen, give her a tip about a local breakfast spot, or leave a simple breakfast spread out on the counter for her. Consider leaving some warm baked goods along with butter and jam for your guest to snack on until lunchtime. It's important to make a guest feel special, but there is a fine line between feeling special and feeling like a stranger in a loved one's home.

As a household host, you aren't there to wait on your guest, but to include them in your household routines. Offering to take them out to see local sites or to go on a hike is great, but don't push it if they just want to chill around the house."

If you don't have time to spend the whole day with her (say, you have work or school), give her a bit of direction for her explorations, or invite her to hang out at your place until you return. If your guest wants to explore on her own: don't feel obligated to let her use your car, but consider loaning her a bicycle or a bus pass to get around. Tell her the most effective way to use public transportation. Suggest things that she needs to see, and tell her you'll meet her somewhere after work. Try to ensure that your guest isn't bored. However, it's not your responsibility to spend every waking moment worrying about whether she's enjoying her stay."

Clean the house, have a clear space for guest to put their bags/shoes/coat/umbrella. If you're planning on playing games or watching something, make sure that the supplies are easily accessible. Anything that could embarrass you may also make your guest uncomfortable: dirt, potentially-offensive books/magazines/movies, or having to root around in the closet or kitchen for something.

This doesn't mean that you need to give them a lecture: it means being kind but clear about the expectations for the space in which they've found themselves. If you like guests to remove their shoes, don't let them walk around for a bit and then comment on it. Pointedly take off your shoes and ask if they would like you to put theirs away too. They will get the hint. If you have furniture that you don't want your guests to touch or rooms that you don't want them to enter, be clear from the beginning to avoid awkwardness later on. Point out the bathroom right away. This way, no one will need to ask where it is in the middle of another conversation."

Having something to do takes the mind off of any lingering discomfort. Give your guests little things to do, like emptying the table or putting the dessert on the table. If they offer to clean the dishes, you may find it most polite to decline and offer them a drink. Sit them at the bar in the kitchen and let them talk to you while you clean dishes.

Put away whatever they are holding (if they want you to) and motion for them to take a seat. Offer to get them something to drink. Once they are settled in, it might even be nice to leave the room (maybe under the guise of getting that drink) so that they have a chance to take a break and look around. If you are constantly with someone, they won't get the chance to absorb the environment, and they might be distracted while you are with them later. This does not mean leave them for a long time \u2013 a minute or two tops should do it. People like having things to do with their hands. So having a drink or munchies can help. Don't offer your guest food and not eat yourself, they will feel rude and gluttonous. Take some snacks too."
