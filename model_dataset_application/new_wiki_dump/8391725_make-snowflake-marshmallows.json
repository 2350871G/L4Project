Piping Your Marshmallow Create outlines. First, if you're making marshmallows to top another treat like hot chocolate or open-faced s'mores, make sure that your snowflakes will fit inside or on top of the container.

If you've never piped icing before, this method isn't advisable for beginners since you have to work so quickly. You might prefer to cut out your snowflakes instead. Dust your snowflakes. Let them sit for one hour to set and stiffen. Then dust their tops with with either cornstarch or Mochiko, flip them over, and do the same to their bottoms. Transfer them to a sieve and shake off any excess dusting. Then either enjoy them straight away or seal them in an airtight container to be stored in the fridge for up to one week. Cutting Out Your Snowflakes Transfer the wet marshmallow to a pan. Dust the bottom of an 8x8 inch (20 x 20 cm) baking pan with cornstarch or Mochiko. Pour the wet marshmallow into the pan. Spray a spatula with cooking oil to prevent the marshmallow from sticking to the pan. Then use the spatula to spread the marshmallow out and smooth the surface. Dust the marshmallow. Dust the top with a light coating of cornstarch or Mochiko. Then give it about an hour to sit and set. Use your finger to test its resistance by pressing the top lightly. The surface should give without breaking. Cut your marshmallows. Use a cookie cutter shaped like a snowflake, or use a knife to cut out your own designs.
