          "description":"Chop 6 oz (170g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate into small, roughly equal pieces (~\u00bc in / 6mm) and add to a double boiler. Heat over low heat, stirring slowly with a rubber spatula, until the chocolate is fully melted. Keep it away from moisture and high heat, which can cause chocolate to seize and turn grainy. You can use other types of chocolate, but lighter chocolate burns more easily. Prevent this by taking the chocolate off the heat when there are only small lumps left, then stirring until it finishes melting. If you want the chocolate to look glossy on the almonds, temper it instead or follow the ganache recipe in the \"Variations\" section below."
