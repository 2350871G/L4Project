If your measurements do not equal one another, adjust the assembly until the diagonals equal one another. Using the Pythagorean Theorem Measure 3 feet (or meters) from the corner of one wall and make a mark. You can use any unit of measurement you want as long as you stay consistent. Measure 4 feet (1.2 m) from the adjacent wall on the same corner. Make a mark. With a level or another straight object, span the distance between the two marks.

Squaring a Room for Wood or Tile Flooring Find the exact center points of all four walls in the room. Take a tape measure, measure out each wall, and then divide the total length of each wall in half. Make a mark at each wall along its center point. Connect both pairs of marks on opposite walls with a chalk line. Take a chalk line and snap it over the middle of the room to connect two center points across from one another. Then go to the adjacent wall and snap another chalk line across the room. You should have a \"+\" sign that meets in the center of the room. Start laying your wood flooring or tile, using the \"+\" as your starting point.
