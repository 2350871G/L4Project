      "headline":"Add a draw engine.",
      "description":"This is important because having more cards in your hands means more resources, and the player with more resources typically wins. There are a couple that work well with Dark Magician. The example above is one using all 3. It is possible to go for a Spellbook engine, using Spellbook Magician of Prophecy, Spellbook of Secrets, and Spellbook of Knowledge. These work by searching each other out to thin the deck, ending the combo in Spellbook of Knowledge to draw 2 cards. Two copies of each card will be necessary to increase the chances of drawing them. If that is not preferred, there is also the option of including 3 copies of Allure of Darkness, which requires removing from play a card in your hand in exchange for drawing two cards. A third possible draw engine would include 2 Chocolate Magician Girl, which discards spellcaster cards to draw more cards and has the bonus effect of reviving spellcasters if attacked. If the Chocolate Magician Girl draw engine is used, it is a preferable idea to use other magician girls, the most ideal being 2 Lemon Magician Girl and 1 Kiwi Magician Girl."

These include spell/trap removal, such as 2 Dark Magic Attack (destroys spells and traps), and cards that have multiple helpful uses, like 2 Dark Magical Circle (allows you to look at the next 3 cards in your deck and reorder them). 2 Dark Magic Veil is a useful way to revive Dark Magicians or summon them directly from the hand. 1 Dark Burning Magic is very powerful if Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl are on the field at the same time, which is made possible by the rest of the spell/trap lineup. Add 1 Eye of Timaeus for the fusion summoning of Dark Magician the Dragon Knight."
