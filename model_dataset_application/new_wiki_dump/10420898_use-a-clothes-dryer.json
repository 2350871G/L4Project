Before loading up the dryer, take a few moments to untangle and shake out the items. Items that are tangled in the dryer may not dry completely or at all. Lengthy items like sheets or large beach towels can get particularly tangled in the washing machine. Make sure that the items are separated and not twisted."

Most clothing items, and even household fabrics like curtains, will have a tag sew onto them giving recommended washing and drying instructions. Some items will recommend tumble drying an item with low heat, and others may specifically say to not tumble dry. Most tags can be found on the inside seam along the back of the neckline of shirts or waistline of pants and shorts. Some dresses and other more formal items may have the tag sewn along one of the inside seams on the sides of the item. Take items that need to be dry cleaned to the dry cleaners. Attempting to wash or dry items that are dry-clean-only at home may permanently damage the material."

          "description":"Delicate fabrics can be damaged over time if they rub against buttons or rough material like denim in the dryer. To extend the life of delicate garments, make some room in a closet to hang clothes to air-dry, or invest in a drying rack. Drying racks are great to lay out sweaters on during the winter months, and can be easily folded up and stored away when you are not using them. Local department stores near you should carry a variety of drying racks that will hold 1 or multiple garments. Delicate garments like bras, sweaters that might easily obtain pulls or become matted, and clothing made of silky or lace fabrics, should not be put in the dryer. The constant tumbling motion will degrade and damage the fabrics. Be careful with clothing items that are 100 percent cotton as they will shrink during the first few times you put them in the dryer. Even items that are partly cotton may have some shrinkage over time. Any cotton items you don\u2019t want to shrink should be hung or laid out to dry as well."

          "description":"Mesh bags are inexpensive and good to have handy for those days when you have enough delicate items to warrant a separate load of laundry, or for when you don\u2019t want to air-dry the items. The mesh bags will help keep them from getting tangled or damaged while tumbling in the dryer. You can purchase mesh bags at local department stores, or online with major retailers. Always put your bras into mesh bags before putting them in the washing or drying machine. This will keep the lengthy straps from getting knotted with other clothing, and will prevent the clasps from hooking onto or putting pulls in other fabrics. Just make sure not to overstuff the mesh bags. Have a couple on hand so you can separate out the load of delicate items as much as possible, and limit yourself to only put 1 large item or 4 small items in each bag."

Dryer sheets will also soften rough fabrics, so keep a box of them next to or on top of your dryer so you don\u2019t forget to use one. When the load of laundry is done, just throw away the sheet as the effects are only good for 1 use. Dryer sheets are available in a variety of scents to match or compliment the soap you used to wash your clothes. If you are sensitive to flowery smells, there are even ones that are unscented. Static cling is more prevalent during the winter or on dry days when there is not a lot of humidity in the air. Make sure to use dryer sheets throughout the winter. If you used fabric softener while washing your clothes, then it is not necessary to use a dryer sheet as both remove static and soften the fabric."

If you overload your dryer, not only will the items still be damp, but overloading can also damage the tumbling mechanism within the dryer over time. Dry large loads of towels, sheets, and blankets separately. When wet, these items are heavy and will not be able to tumble properly if stuffed into the dryer at once."

Standard drying temperatures may be labeled: Regular, Medium, Low, or Air Fluff. The wording for this, however, can vary slightly between brands and styles of dryers. The heat setting is usually a knob that you can rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise to select an option. The pointer on the dial needs to line up with the indicated notch for a particular setting. Use the regular heat temperature for everyday clothing and cotton items like towels and sheets. The medium setting will emit slightly less heat than the regular setting. This temperature is also good for a medium load of casual or everyday clothing items, but not for thick or plush cotton-like towels. Use the low setting for drying delicate items like bras, curtains, or tablecloths. If you dried a load of laundry and forgot it was in the dryer for a day or two, the items may be wrinkled or creased. Use the air fluff setting to inject life back into the items, and remove any creases before you take the items out and fold them."

Within each section, there will be a grade of specific timing options like more, optimum, or less drying that will limit the drying time for different load sizes. The timer is usually represented by a knob with a pointer that will click as you turn it clockwise to match a desired setting. If you set the temperature to regular because you have a medium load of everyday clothing items, then set the timer to the section labeled cottons and optimum drying. For large loads, set the dial to cottons and more drying, and for smaller loads, set the dial to cottons and less drying. If you set the temperature to a low heat because you have a medium load of delicate items, then set the timer to the section labeled delicates and optimum drying.

This setting will look like a dial with increments of 10 minutes around it. Using the numerical timer requires less thought because the time is not usually printed with the categorical options. Simply turn the dial clockwise until the point on the dial matches the desired drying time. Most small or medium loads that are damp will be dry within 20 or 30 minutes.

To empty most lint traps, you simply lift the small handle on the lint screen until the entire piece is removed. Then glide your fingers over the rigid netting on the lint screen, and remove any fibers or hairs that have built up on it. The lint will naturally want to stick to itself, so use the lint to aid the cleaning process. Once the netting is clean, slide the lint screen back into place so you are ready to dry your next load of laundry."
