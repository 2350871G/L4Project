          "description":"The term \u201cenergy drink\u201d refers broadly to beverages that contain a mix of ingredients (almost always including caffeine) that are intended to provide a burst of energy, alertness, and focus. Beyond that, there exists a wide range of products that fit into the category, from soda-like canned drinks to small liquid \u201cshots\u201d to powdered mixes. Setting a blanket limit on how many energy drinks you should have per day is therefore quite difficult. For the most popular, mass-marketed energy drinks out there, a limit of two servings per day seems reasonably safe for most healthy adults. For non-concentrated liquid energy drinks (like Red Bull, Monster, Rockstar, etc. ), this equates to about 16 ounces (500 ml) per day. Consider this to be an upper limit, though, and use energy drinks as little as possible as your safest choice."

In moderation, caffeine is safe for most people, but in high doses it can cause cardiac irregularities and other medical issues (and, in extreme cases, death). Recommendations vary because the effects of higher caffeine intake are not entirely clear, but 300-400 mg of caffeine per day is a good daily maximum to keep in mind. For reference, a typical cup of coffee (8 oz.) has about 100 mg of caffeine; a soda (12 oz), about 40 mg; and energy drinks (250 ml), typically somewhere between 50 mg and 160 mg. Under normal circumstances, pregnant or nursing women should limit themselves to 200 mg or fewer of caffeine per day; children, 50-100 mg per day maximum."

Some experts and mothers-to-be still believe in swearing off caffeine completely during pregnancy, but studies indicate that a reduced daily caffeine intake is generally of no concern for both mother and child.

Because energy drinks have no nutritional or therapeutic benefit, can contain unknown ingredients, and have not been subjected to long-term studies regarding their effect on children, the safest measure is to have children entirely avoid consuming them.

Ideally, you should rely on a healthy diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep to provide you with the energy you need to get through the day.
