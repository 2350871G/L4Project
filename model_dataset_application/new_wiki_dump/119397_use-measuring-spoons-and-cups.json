          "description":"Dry measuring cups are designed to be filled to the top of the cup, whereas wet cups have a measuring line below the brim of the cup. This helps to prevent the liquids from spilling over the edge of the cup when they are transferred to the bowl. Fill each type of cup to their unique measuring line. Check the bottom of the measuring cup for a label if you are unsure if you have a wet or dry measuring cup. Place the cup on a flat surface when measuring liquids to ensure an accurate measurement. If you are using a jug with cup lines, use this for both wet and dry ingredients. Pour the liquid so that the bottom of the meniscus is at the measuring line. Cups are often abbreviated as \"C\" and most measuring cup sets will contain \u00bc C, \u2153 C, \u00bd C, and 1 C.\nNote that a US cup is 240 mL, whereas a UK cup is 250 mL. If your recipe is written in America, assume that it is a US cup. It is safe to presume that recipes written in Europe and the rest of the world use UK cup measurements."
