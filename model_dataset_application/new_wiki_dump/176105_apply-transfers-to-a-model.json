      "description":"Although new modelers can leave it at that, modelers looking for a high quality finish will apply some decal solution onto the decal afterwards. The main manufacturers of the decal solution are Humbrol, Revell, Tamiya and Vallejo. The point of a decal softener is to 'melt' the decal and help it conform to the contours of your model to make the decal look like it has been painted on.This can help the decal mould to panel lines or recesses and even the wingtips and nose of aircrafts. Now, you will have a decal that looks supreme on your next model!"
