  "text":" Tracing a Circle Find something round that you can trace. Any round object will work. You can use a round glass, the bottom of a candle, or a circular piece of paper. Just make sure the rounded edge is smooth. Hold the round object on a piece of paper. Take the round part of the object and place it flat on the paper where you want to draw your circle. Use the hand you don\u2019t draw with to hold it in place so it doesn\u2019t move when you\u2019re tracing it. Trace around the edge of the object. Take a pencil and follow along the round edge of the object until you\u2019ve completed the circle. When you\u2019re finished, take the object off the piece of paper and you\u2019ll have a perfect circle! If there are any gaps in the circle after you move the round object, fill them in with the pencil. Drawing a Circle with a Compass Attach a pencil to a drawing compass. Insert the pencil in the slot at the end of the compass and tighten it into place so it\u2019s secure. Adjust the compass arms depending on how big you want your circle to be. If you want a big circle, pull the arms of the compass away from each other so the angle between them is bigger. If you want a small circle, push the arms closer together so there\u2019s a small angle between them. Place the ends of the compass on a piece of paper. Position the compass where you want to draw the circle. The end of the compass with the pencil attached to it will be where the outside of your circle is, and the other end of the compass will be the center of the circle. Rotate the compass to draw a circle. Keeping both ends of the compass on the piece of paper, rotate the compass so the end with the pencil spins around and draws a circle. Avoid shifting the compass while you\u2019re drawing the circle or your circle will be uneven. Using a String Tie a piece of string to the pointed end of a pencil. The longer the piece of string you use, the bigger your circle will be. Hold the end of the string down on a piece of paper. Wherever the end of the string is on the paper is where the center of the circle will be. Use your fingers to hold the end of the string in place. Pull the string taut and draw a circle with the pencil. Keep holding the end of the string down as you\u2019re drawing the circle. If you keep the string pulled taut as you draw a circle around the center, you should end up with a perfect circle! Using a Protractor Lay a protractor flat on a piece of paper. Position the protractor on the paper where you want to draw a circle. Trace the curved edge of the protractor. This will be the first half of your circle. Don\u2019t trace the flat edge of the protractor. Make sure you hold the protractor in place while you trace it so it doesn\u2019t shift and mess up your line. Rotate the protractor and trace the other half of the circle. Line the straight edge of the protractor up with the ends of the curved line you traced. Then, trace the curved edge of the protractor to close your circle. Drawing a Circle with a Pin Place paper on top of a piece of cardboard. Any kind of cardboard will work, as long as it\u2019s thick and a pin can push through it. Push a pin through the paper and the cardboard. Position the pin so it\u2019s in the spot where you want the center of the circle to be. Make sure it\u2019s secure in the cardboard so it doesn\u2019t shift when you\u2019re drawing the circle. Put a rubber band around the pin. The larger the rubber band, the bigger your circle will be. If you want to draw a small circle, use a small rubber band or wrap the rubber band around the pin twice. If you don\u2019t have a rubber band, you can tie a piece of string into a circle and use that instead. Place the tip of a pencil in the other end of the rubber band. At this point, the rubber band should be wrapped around both the pin and the pencil. Pull the rubber band taut and draw a circle with the pencil. Make sure you keep the rubber band pulled taut while you draw the circle so it's even. Drawing a Circle with Your Hand Hold a pencil like you normally would. You want to hold the pencil using the hand you\u2019d normally draw and write with. Place the tip of the pencil on a piece of paper. Choose a spot on the paper where you want to draw your circle. Don\u2019t press hard on the paper with the tip of the pencil. You want to be lightly holding the pencil tip on top of the paper. Move the paper in a circle underneath the pencil. Use your free hand to slowly move the paper in a circle under the pencil, which will cause the pencil to draw a circle on the paper. If you want to draw a big circle, make a big circle with the paper. If you want to draw a small circle, only make a small circle when you move the paper.",
