In game play box, you will find four different color cars, which when setting up, you'll need to pick four of the same color for each person. (i.e. Player 1 takes out all 4 cars of one car, while player 2 will take out four cars of another color.) Generally, you will be given car color choices such as yellow, red, green and blue. Set up the cars from the color you've picked. Place each car on their respective spots based on color then car (player) number at the bottom of the board. Each car has a number at the top of the car (via either a sticker placed on top or via an engrained number in the plastic piece). Roll the dice to find out who begins first. The total of each dice determines the player who begins: highest goes first."

      "description":"Each die represents the number of spaces each car can move singly. (i.e. On your move, you can roll the dice. You end up moving two cars. If the dice come up as 6 and 1, one car moves six spots in one direction, while another car can move one spot in another direction.) You can move one car the total number between the two dice, but that defeats the purpose of pace of play. You may move either forwards or sideways. Roll again if the player rolls doubles (after moving this number that is). Once you stop rolling doubles, play must be relinquished to the next player."

      "description":"# Know when bumping is acceptable. If you land on a color on the board which isn't your color car and another player stops on that spot in their turn, that car must move back to the starting line of cars with their car. If you are on a wrongly colored spot with a car, you can get bumped only by the car who has official rights to be there. If the car moves through the space that contains a car onto another space that doesn't, the space with the car isn't \"bumpable\" and can continue the game. If the same color player lands on one of their spots, these players can't be bumped. If you end up having to bump them, you will be forced to retreat to start again with that car. Rarely will a car be bumped on a grey spot, however, you can still bump these cars - even up in Free Parking territory. Even if both cars aren't the same as the color spot in question, if two cars land on a space that isn't theirs, the first player to land on the spot is safe while the other car must retreat to start. No bumping occurs if two of your own cars end up occupying the same space."

      "description":"Keep aiming to follow the direction of play into the numbers at the top of the board.Aim to park your four cars matching the color and number into their appropriate parking spots. Make sure that all totals can be right on. (If you have four spots in the grey area and one spot into the colored, if you roll one six and you only have one car left to park, you must relinquish until you roll only a five. If you roll less, great - move your car that much closer, but you must match the number of spots needed to enter the spot exactly to park the car.) Numbered cars of ones and two will generally find it easier to enter from the left side, while the third and four cars will find it easier to enter from the right. Don't ever reverse directions in the parking lot. If you overshoot your spot, you must continue to move around the path, out and around again."
