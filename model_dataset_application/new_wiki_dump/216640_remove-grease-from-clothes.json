          "headline":"Try dish detergent or dish soap.",
          "description":"The simplest way to remove anything oily or greasy from almost any fabric is by generously applying dish detergent or soap to the stain. Using a small brush, like an old toothbrush, scrub the stain in a circular motion for several minutes. Keep adding additional detergent or soap if needed. Allow the fabric to rest for 30 minutes before placing it in the washing machine. Finally, wash the item in the warmest water you can safely use for the material. For best results, find a dish soap that is specifically labeled for dissolving oil since these often have a special type of oil-eating bacteria as an ingredient. Your clothing should be grease-free after a single wash, but you can repeat the process again if it's not."

        {
          "headline":"Pour on some baby powder.",
          "description":"As soon as you're able, pour a small amount of baby powder all over the fresh grease stains on your clothing. The baby powder is fine enough that it will fill in the crevices between the fibers, and absorb the grease. Leave the baby powder to 'soak' for 10-15 minutes, and then brush it off. If the grease is still faintly visible, toss it in the washing machine under cold water. The combination should do the trick, and by the time the clothing has dried, there should be no trace of grease left!"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Rub some chalk on it.",
          "description":"Because chalk is such a fine powder, it easily absorbs the grease in your clothes and makes it easy to remove. Fill in your grease stain with plain white chalk, or scrape some of the powder over the stain. Allow it to set for 10-15 minutes and then rub it off. If the stain is still visible, you can wash it with cold water. The rinse/dry cycle will finish the task and should fully remove the stain."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cover it up with cornstarch.",
          "description":"Yes, another one of the fine powders (just like baby powder and chalk), cornstarch works wonders at soaking up fresh grease and oil stains. Pour a small amount of the powder on the stain and allow it to set for a quarter of an hour. You can brush off the cornstarch afterwards, or leave it on and put it in the washing machine. Wash your clothes on 'cold', and your grease stain should be gone!"

        {
          "headline":"Pour on some talcum powder.",
          "description":"Don't have any of the aforementioned powders on hand? Try using talcum powder to remove the stains. Follow the same process as explained above by pouring a small amount of the powder onto the grease stain, and allowing it to soak for 10-15 minutes. When it's had a bit of time to soak up the grease, throw the clothing into the washing machine and wash it on 'cold'."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Make a salt and rubbing alcohol solution.",
          "description":"This solution works best for stains on thicker fabrics, such as denim or linen. Mix together one part salt with three parts rubbing alcohol, and then pour it onto the grease stain. Use a soft cloth to rub the mixture into the stain, working it into the fibers. Allow the solution to soak for 10-15 minutes, and then wash your clothing as you normally would. By the time the clothing has been washed and dried, their should be a missing grease spot!"

          "description":"If you're up for spending a few bucks, pick up a specialty dry cleaning solution used for cleaning up grease stains. These are typically spray-on or iron-on liquids that are applied directly to the stain prior to washing. Because they are dry-cleaning grade, they should work out the stains almost immediately, making your clothing look good-as-new."

Heavily douse your grease stain with hairspray, using a paper towel in between the fabric and the spray. Allow it to soak for thirty minutes, and then put it in the washing machine for a regular wash. Air-dry your clothes when finished in the washing machine, and you should be good to go!
