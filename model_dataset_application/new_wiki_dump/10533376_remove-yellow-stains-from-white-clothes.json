          "description":"Add the capful of bleach to a load of white clothes along with detergent to remove stains while also improving your clothes' overall shine. However, make sure your clothes can be safely bleached before you wash them this way. Avoid bleaching colored clothes or delicates, as the bleach might damage them. You can check to see if your clothes can be safely bleached by looking at their tags. If a hollow white triangle is on the tags, this means they can be safely bleached. If the triangle has diagonal stripes in the middle of it, those clothes can only be treated with non-chlorine bleach. If the tag on your clothes contains a solid triangle with an X on top of it, that means they cannot be bleached at all."

Mix the agent with cold water, per the instructions on the bottle, then toss it into your laundry machine with the detergent and the stained clothes and wash them as normal. You can buy bluing agent at any department store or grocery store that sells laundry detergent. Note that bluing agent isn\u2019t actually a cleaning agent, so although it will offset the yellow hue of your stains, it won\u2019t do anything to make them cleaner."

Add 0.5 cups (120 mL) of borax to your laundry along with detergent at the beginning of the wash cycle to wash clothes with odorous stains. Borax is also a great multipurpose cleaner you can use to clean the inside of your car, your pet\u2019s bedding, and even the washing machine itself!"

Simply add the rust remover to your washing machine as it's filling with water and let the clothes soak in it for 5 minutes. Then, add your detergent and wash the clothes as normal. Be sure to follow the usage instructions on the bottle very closely, as rust remover fumes can be dangerous when inhaled. To best protect yourself, wear rubber safety gloves when handling rust remover."

For the best results on white clothing, use a toothpaste with whitening properties. Avoid using colored toothpaste, since this may actually stain your white clothes even worse! The toothpaste method typically works well on cotton clothes, although it may not work on other fabrics."

Rub this paste onto the stain and allow it to sit for 2 hours. Finally, wash your stained clothing as normal in a hot water cycle. The crushed aspirin method works because the main ingredient in aspirin is salicylic acid, which is just as effective at removing stains as vinegar or lemon juice.
