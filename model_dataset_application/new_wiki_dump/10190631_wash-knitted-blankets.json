Remove from the towel and allow to dry. If your blanket is cotton lay it flat on a towel to dry. This will ensure it doesn\u2019t stretch out or become saggy. If your blanket is woolen, hang it on a clothesline or horizontal clothes rack. You may also like to leave your woollen blanket in direct sunlight for a few minutes, as this helps to counteract any musty odors. However don\u2019t leave it out any longer than this. You can also shape the blanket as it dries, to make sure that it dries to your liking."
