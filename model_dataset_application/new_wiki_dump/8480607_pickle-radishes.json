For example, if you are choosing a radish in the winter or spring, they are likely to have a sweeter taste. On the other hand, in the dry summer months, many radishes can be bitter and peppery. While Cherry Belle radishes are the most common, you can also choose a milder radish like the French Breakfast radish, which has an extra crunch.

Once everything is inside, take the vinegar, sugar, and salt mixture and pour it over the radishes. Make sure that there is a little bit of space between the liquid marinade and the lip of the jar. Also, when putting the lid on, make sure not to secure it tightly as you want to leave room for carbonation to escape. You can also add 6 heads of fresh dill weed or a tablespoon of pink/black peppercorn for extra flavor. You may have to place a weight or other item into the jar to keep the radishes submerged. For example, you can take a smaller jar full of water and put it into the jar to weigh the radishes down."

While the radishes ferment, they may lose their vibrant color. However, the flavor should deepen and they should remain crunchy. Keep in mind that fermented radishes have a pungent odor that may increase the longer they are jarred."
