      "headline":"Feel comfortable.",
      "description":"Pick out something you like. It's best to wear something you feel comfortable in. Don't wear what all the girls are wearing just because it's fashionable. Put on something that you want to, and when you are shopping, think about whether you will actually wear this."

      "headline":"Accept that your body is changing.",
      "description":"At this age, everyone's body is going through changes. Going up a size or two could mean that you're getting taller or that your hips are widening. If something doesn't fit you - don't stress over it; instead, get it in a bigger size or go to a teen store instead."

    {
      "headline":"Dress appropriately for your age.",
      "description":"Don't buy 5 inch (12.7 cm) heels or super-short skirts to look more grown up. Have fun with your style and stay true to who you are. If you are into  emo/ goth stuff, make sure you don't purchase anything shocking, or with inappropriate logos. No one wants to see a tween wearing a shirt that says \"Come Play Dying\"."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Accessorize.",
      "description":"Try adding a few accessories to it. Don't overdo it, though. If you want to wear new accessories, try finding ones that are inexpensive and the kind you like and would fit you. For your hair, try accessories like headbands, barrettes, or flower hair-ties, or wearing it loose/in a plain ponytail."

      "headline":"Go shopping.",
      "description":"If you want to go shopping, go to places that suit you and are in a clean environment. It doesn't have to be a popular store - remember that nobody will know if you buy a great and inexpensive shirt from a small and \"uncool\" store in your area."
