Water can be shaken out and it will start a fire from small spark. Burns very hot but very quickly so should be used with other tinder such Aspen needles, twigs, etc. (Wrapped inside to start fire.) Two snelled fish hooks may be used with leader to catch fish. Twenty pound test leader. Use with hooks for fishing; use with needle to sew clothing, use for snares; use to lash together shelter."
