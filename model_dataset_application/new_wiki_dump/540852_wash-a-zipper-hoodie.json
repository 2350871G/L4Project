It\u2019s recommended that you wash hoodies after about six or seven wears because as outerwear they don\u2019t dirty as quickly. Washing less frequently prevents added wear and tear. As long as your hoodie doesn\u2019t smell, it\u2019s okay to go a bit between washes. If you exercise in your hoodie, then you will likely need to wash it more. If you\u2019re questioning whether or not it\u2019s dirty, it\u2019s better to go ahead and wash it. You don\u2019t want worries about a dirty hoodie overshadowing your day. Consider what you\u2019re wearing under your hoodie. The more layers you wear, the less sweat your hoodie encounters."
