You will need some specialized bricks for this build, such as bricks with holes in them, thin rod-type axles, and separate wheel rims and tires.

Set these aside for now. Build the car chassis. Place the 1x10 bricks side by side, like railroad tracks. Snap the 2x4 plate and 8x4 plate to the tops of the bricks. Now you should have a chassis that is 4x10. Build the car body. This will be the structure that the rubber band attaches to in order to create the power to move the car. Snap the 1x4 brick to the very front of the chassis. Forming a \u201cT\u201d shape, snap the 2x4 brick to the middle of the plate just behind the brick you just placed.

Attach the 2x8 brick so that it covers the last 2 studs of the \u201cT\u201d shape. The back of this brick should hang out over the back end of the chassis. Tie the rubber bands in a cow hitch knot. This is an easy knot you can tie with two closed loops (like rubber bands are). Wrap one rubber band around the finger and thumb of your non-dominant hand. Slip the other band through the center of band #1 and pull about halfway through. Slide one end of band #2 through the loop formed by its other end and pull to secure. Place the back axle. Slide one axle through the last hole of the 10x1 bricks at the very back of your car. Attach a wheel to either end of the axle. Attach the knotted rubber bands to the back axle. To do this, slide one end of one band up and under the axle until you can see a little loop. Thread the other end of the bands and pull to secure. Pull the rubber band up and over the top of your car body. The band should run under the whole length of the chassis. Slip the end of the rubber band under the protruding part of the very top brick. Place the front axle. Slide the other axle through the first hole of the 10x1 bricks at the very front of your car. Make sure the rubber band is under the axle. Attach a wheel to either end of the axle. Make the car go. To wind up the car, place the car on a flat, smooth surface and pull the it backwards. This will build up tension in the rubber band. When you let go, it should go speeding away! Building a Balloon-Powered LEGO Car Build a basic LEGO car. The design in this part creates a \u201cdragster\u201d-style car that is very light and has a low, stable center of gravity. You can design your own car, but try to keep it lightweight and low to the ground.

You will also need one small party balloon. Place the 2x8 bricks together end-to-end in two rows. Each row should be 2x16 now. Snap a 2x4 brick to the top of each row to connect the 2x8 bricks. Turn the connected bricks over. Snap the thin plate to the bottom of both rows so that they are connected. Attach the tires to the axles. Place an axle at each end of the car. Turn the body over. You should now have a car body that is 4x16 with the two 2x4 bricks on top and wheels on the bottom. Stack 5 2x4 bricks together. Snap this column to the back of your car body. Make sure the bricks are connected snugly, but don\u2019t press too hard or you might break the car body. Snap the 1x2 bricks to the top of the 2x4 column. Place one at each end to create a little hollow in the middle. Attach the final 2x4 brick to the top of the column. You should have a small hole in the middle of the column near the top. Thread the balloon through the hole. In order to propel your car, you will want the body of the balloon to be placed over the body of your car. Slip the neck of the balloon through the hole, but don\u2019t pull the balloon all the way through. Inflate the balloon. You may find it easier to blow up the balloon if you pick up the car and hold it close to your face while you inflate it. When the balloon is inflated, pinch the neck with your fingers to keep the air in. Place your car on a flat, smooth surface. Release the neck of the balloon. Your car should speed away from you as the air pushes out of the balloon!",
