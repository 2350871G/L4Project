The exact measurements on the water to vinegar ratios are rather loose, because most linoleum floors do not need an entire bucket\u2019s worth of cleaning solution to clean the floor surface.

          "description":"Use a cleaning product specifically intended for cleaning linoleum floors. Linoleum-specific cleaning products can be found in most flooring and home department stores. Most linoleum floor cleaners need to be diluted with water, so follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions by mixing in the appropriate amount of cleaning detergent in a large bucket filled with the correct measurements of water. If using a chemical cleaner, make sure that your cleaning area is well ventilated. Alternatively, you could mix about 6-7 drops of a mild detergent (such as dish soap) with approximately one gallon of warm water as your cleaning solution. Bear in mind that this solution will clean and disinfect your floors, but a linoleum-specific cleaner might remove dirt a little better. Chemicals that have high pH levels can be extremely damaging to linoleum flooring, so stay away from cleaning products like ammonia when cleaning your linoleum floors."

Mop the floor in sections, working in about 4-6 square foot areas for each dip of the mop. If you want to clean you floors more thoroughly, you can use a soft bristled scrub brush instead of a mop. This method would most likely require you to work on your hands and knees. If you are cleaning your floor with a vinegar and water solution, you don\u2019t need to rinse off your floor. Vinegar is a natural disinfectant, and the vinegar and water will evaporate along with the vinegar smell."

Refill the bucket of water with cool, clean water. Dip the clean mop into the clean water, wring out any excess water, and rinse the cleaning solution from the floor. Again, work in areas approximately 4-6 square foot areas for each time you dip the mop into the water. When you are finished rinsing the floor, dump out the bucket of water. If chemical cleaning solutions are not rinsed from the floor, they will attract tiny particles of dust and dirt, that will be harder to remove later."

Allow each coat to thoroughly dry by wait approximately 30 minutes in between coats. Let the final coat of polish dry for approximately an hour before moving back furniture and walking on the floor surface. Try to restrict the number of times you drag your mop over a given area. Moving your mop over an area more than once or twice runs the risk of leaving streaks in the polish."
