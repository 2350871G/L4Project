Avoid taking a cutting from a lavender plant that is super young and opt for one that\u2019s mature. A young lavender plant will be made up of entirely green sections. It's important to have old and new growth so that stable roots are able to grow out of the younger plant."

          "description":"Look for stems that have leaves on them but no flower buds. It takes a lot of energy for the plant to make flowers, and you want the plant to put all of its effort into creating new roots, not new flowers."

          "description":"How long you make the cutting is up to you, but be sure it has at least 3-5 leaf nodes on the stem. Remember that the longer you make the cutting, the deeper down into the soil it will need to be placed. Having 3-5 leaf nodes is important so that the cutting is mature enough to grow strong roots."

Try to keep the cut as clean as possible by using slow, precise movements with the knife and holding the stem steady as you cut. Avoid using scissors as they can damage the plant and partially close up the stem making it hard for the roots to grow properly."

Keep a pair or two of leaves at the top of the plant while removing the lower portion of leaves, which will likely be roughly 3-5 sets. Remove the bottom section of leaves easily by taking the stem between your fingers and pulling down on it gently. Removing the bottom leaves lets you put this section of the stem into the soil."

Take the cutting and gently dip the end of the cut portion into a rooting hormone so that roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) of the stem is covered. Purchase a rooting hormone from your local gardening center, big box store, or online."

Fill your pot mostly full of soil, making sure the pot is big enough to hold the cutting. Try using terracotta pots instead of plastic ones as they breathe better. Lavender cuttings do well in soil that\u2019s airy. Make sure the cuttings will have at least 2 in (5.1 cm) of space around them in the pot.

Make the hole deep enough for your cutting depending on how long or short you cut the stem. For example, if your cutting is only 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) tall, your hole only needs to be about 1 in (2.5 cm) deep so that it's roughly 1/4 the length of the stem.
