You can find c-clamps at hardware stores, department stores, and online.Tip: If your garage door has a metal lock, which looks like a bolt at the bottom of your garage door, slide the bolt into the door track when the door is raised to hold it open."

If your cables are tightly wound on the pulley, but 1 side of the door is uneven, then you need to adjust the tension on the torsion spring mounted above the center of the garage door frame. Use steel rods at least 18 inches (46 cm) long. You can find them at hardware stores and online. Remove the rods from the spring after you make your adjustments. The garage door must be lowered in order to adjust the spring."
