Hold the fork in place with your nondominant hand so the ham doesn\u2019t move around while you\u2019re cutting it.

You can cut off 1 slice at a time, or push the knife deeper to cut off multiple. Work the blade around the bone, and cut as close to the bone as you can with your knife so you don\u2019t leave any ham behind. Avoid using a knife that doesn\u2019t easily bend since it won\u2019t be able to cut as close to the bone.Warning: Never point the knife blade toward your body since you could accidentally cut yourself if it slips."

Place the slices on a plate if they\u2019re ready to serve, or leave them on your cutting board if you want to cut them into smaller pieces. If you have trouble pulling a slice off of the bone, go around it with your paring knife again to remove any fat or ligaments holding it in place."

That way, you have more manageable slices and your ham won\u2019t be as fatty. You can remove some of the fat off of the ham if you want."
