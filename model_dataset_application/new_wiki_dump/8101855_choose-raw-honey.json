Either way, purchase your honey directly (or as directly as you can) from a nearby source, whose practices and trace-of-sale are more easily verified than a global company\u2019s. Ensure that your honey is in fact 100% raw by speaking directly with the producers or as few middlemen as possible. Again, be wary of labelling when browsing honey in your grocery store.

In contrast, expect raw honey to crystallize more readily than treated honey, resulting in a less smooth liquid. However:\nThis is less of a rule and more of a guideline.

Treated honey is also filtered to remove elements (such as pollen) that customers may think of as impurities. Therefore, a honey that has crystallized and/or appears to contain \u201cspecks\u201d is more likely to be raw."

If possible, ask for a taste test or buy small samples to find which kinds please you the most. Honeys come in both \u201cmonofloral\u201d and \u201cmultifloral\u201d varieties.
