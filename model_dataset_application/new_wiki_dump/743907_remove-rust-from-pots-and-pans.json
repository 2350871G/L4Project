  "text":" Using Salt Gather up table salt and a brown paper bag. The salt acts as a gentle abrasive, helping you to easily scrape up the rust without damaging the pan. Pour the salt in the rusted pan. Pour enough to lightly cover the area you need to rub off with a thin coating. Scour it with the brown paper. If the salt gets really rusty, dispose of it and add fresh salt. Season the pan to avoid future rust.
