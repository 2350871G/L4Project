Try to choose a dark chocolate that has only a few ingredients on the label. Quality dark chocolate should have chocolate liquor or cocoa listed as its first ingredient. Chocolate liquor is the paste that is created while grinding cocoa nibs and it does not contain alcohol. You may also see cocoa powder, cocoa nibs, and cocoa butter listed on the label. Sugar is usually added to dark chocolate to balance its bitter taste. When choosing dark chocolate, be sure that sugar is not the first ingredient."
