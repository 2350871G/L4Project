          "description":"Darts come in many different materials, from wood to plastic to metals like  brass, nickel, and silver. Unless you\u2019re a professional player, the material you go with will mostly be a matter of preference. It\u2019s possible to become an expert thrower with any material, so long as its properly weighted and easy to hold. Nickel or silver darts are a good choice for newer players, as they\u2019re well-balanced, relatively durable, and less pricey than darts made with pro-grade materials. Tungsten is the most popular material amongst skilled darts players due to its even weight and resistance to wear and tear. However, these advantages also make it considerably more expensive."

          "headline":"Pick out a comfortable barrel shape.",
          "description":"The barrel is the part of the dart you hold while throwing. To determine what size and shape are best for you, you\u2019ll first need to figure out what grip you\u2019ll be using. The best way to do this is to take hold of the dart naturally and simply see how it feels in your hand. Barrels that are too bulky or slender around the grip point can easily throw off your technique. If you\u2019re new to the game, experiment with different grips, such as the 3-finger, 4-finger, and pencil grip, and settle on the one that feels most instinctive to you."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try out different weights.",
          "description":"Play at least one game with a set of light, medium, and heavy darts. Lightweight darts take less effort to throw, but have little control once they\u2019re in motion. By contrast, heavier darts tend to fly straight and true, but require more physical strength to throw accurately. If your throwing is inconsistent with every weight, it could be a sign that you need an in-between weight. Darts range in weight from 12 grams to a whopping 50 grams. This means that all players should be able to find a set that works for their preferred playing style."

          "headline":"Match the barrel shape and weight to your preferred grip.",
          "description":"Where the dart is weighted is important, too. If the front end of the dart is loaded and you prefer to grip closer to the back, it will divebomb as soon as you release it. If there\u2019s too much weight in the back and you grip near the front, the entire dart can flip and cause you to miss your shot. Your best bet is to have most of the weight directly beneath the point where your fingers come together."

          "headline":"Determine how much grip you want.",
          "description":"Metal darts are imprinted with a fine tooth-like texturing known as knurling. Generally speaking, the more knurling there is around the barrel, the more secure your grip on the dart will be. Again, this is mostly a matter of preference. Some darts feature bumps or ridges rather than knurling to offer a more moderate amount of texture. Too much grip can actually be problematic\u2014if the knurling is especially sharp or deep, it may cause the dart to \u201cstick\u201d to your fingers, interfering with your release. Slick paints or coatings on the body of a set of darts may make them harder to hold onto than those with a plain metal finish."

          "description":"Make sure your darts have tips that are appropriate for the surface you\u2019re playing on. Soft plastic tips are intended for use on electronic dart boards, which have lots of small holes molded into the face. For traditional cork boards, you\u2019ll need harder steel-tipped darts in order to get a good stick. If you use the wrong kind of tip on the wrong kind of board, your darts could simply bounce off, or even damage the surface."

          "headline":"Thread on smooth flights to increase your throwing distance.",
          "description":"The winglike plastic flights that attach to the tail of the shaft serve to make the dart more aerodynamic. Standard flights are narrow and smooth, which cuts down on air resistance and allows the dart to travel farther. In most cases, smooth flights will give you the most success if you play with light-to-medium weight darts. Smooth flights are useful for minimizing drag and keeping lighter darts from spiralling out."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use dimpled flights to stabilize the dart\u2019s movement.",
          "description":"Dimpled flights are covered in tiny bumps that catch the air and help control the dart\u2019s speed. They can come in handy if you play with heavy or irregularly weighted darts that are vulnerable to sudden changes of direction. Because there are so many possible combinations of weights, shapes, and materials, there\u2019s no hard and fast rule for which type of flight should be used for a certain type of dart. It\u2019s a good idea to play around with different flights, even if they don\u2019t follow the normal weight pairing guidelines. You may end up discovering a setup that compliments your individual playing style."

You might put together a matching set in your favorite color scheme, or mix things up to add some flair to your game.
