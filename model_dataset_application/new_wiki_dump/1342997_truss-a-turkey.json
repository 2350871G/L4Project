Pull the ends of the twine down along the breast of the bird and cross the strings under the rib cage on the inside of the leg joint. Pull the ends of the string tightly until you feel the wings are secure."

Cross the twine under the legs, then move the ends around the back of the turkey at the tail. You may have to lift the bird a little to get underneath it. Cross the ends of the twine again. Pull the ends until they are secure."

Wrap it around the bottom of the ankles crossing the ends again. Bring the twine back to the top of the ankles and cross them again to create a knot. Tie a knot in the twine and trim the ends if necessary. This is the most common and traditional way to truss a turkey and will result in a compact shape suitable for the main course centerpiece for your dinner."

Cross the twine, then pull the ends back under the turkey legs. Pull the ends outward to tighten the twine and elevate the legs. This style of trussing will hold the legs straight out from the body of the turkey. This allows the heat to flow around the legs, cooking them more evenly than traditional trussing. The traditional style presses the legs against the body of the bird, cutting off the source of heat to the inside of the leg."

Trim any excess kitchen twine using kitchen sheers. Cook the turkey on its back with the legs elevated off the pan. The indentations of the twine are helpful guides for carving the cooked turkey."
