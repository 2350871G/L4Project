          "description":"Set your oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C) and let it heat up. The process of seasoning cast iron involves coating it with a layer of oil and baking it. Seasoning, or curing, the pan will cover it with a non-stick surface, make the pan easier to clean, and protect it from rust. Most new cast iron pans come pre-seasoned, but you'll have to season any that haven't been cured by the manufacturer. You can still season a new pan if it comes pre-seasoned, and you should definitely season an old or second-hand cast iron pan before using it."

Rinse the pan under hot water and dry it completely with a clean towel. You can also use a dish brush with stiff bristles to clean the pan. Most people recommend not washing cast iron with soap once it has been seasoned, because the soap can slowly remove the seasoning. However, because you're about to season the pan, use soap now to make sure the pan is clean."

It\u2019s best to use a small amount of solid shortening for seasoning, because too much shortening or using liquid oil can leave a sticky residue on the pan."

After cooking with your cast iron pan, hold it under hot running water. While the water is running, wipe the pan out with a clean cloth to remove food particles. For mildly soiled and well-seasoned pans, this may be all you need to clean your cast iron. If you're worried about bacteria because you aren't using soap, just make sure to preheat your cast iron before adding food. Cast iron heats up very quickly, and even over medium heat the pan will quickly reach temperatures high enough to kill any bacteria."

Before putting it away, wipe out any excess shortening with a cloth or paper towel. Fully seasoning a pan is a process that happens over time. As you add more oil to the pan and cook fatty foods in the cast iron, the surface will become more protected and more non-stick."
