Use the inside of the foot, almost directly in the center of your shoe where the arch of your foot is, to kick the bag directly straight up. Be sure to angle your ankle so that the inside of your foot is parallel to the ceiling in order to kick the sack straight up. After the first kick, catch the sack in your hand. Then, practice dropping, kicking, and catching the sack until you can consistently kick the bag straight up. If you\u2019re having trouble kicking straight up, try slightly bending your other leg while you\u2019re standing. Once you feel comfortable performing an inside kick with 1 foot, be sure to practice this kick with your other foot."

Just like with an inside kick, angle your ankle to keep your foot parallel to the ceiling in order to kick the hacky sack straight up. You may have a little bit of trouble at first bending your leg \u201coutward\u201d instead of toward the center of your body. This is ok! It will get easier with practice."

Be sure to kick your toes up instead of toward your head to avoid getting hit with the hacky sack! This kick is very similar to the one that people usually use to juggle a soccer ball. You may hear this kick be referred to as \u201cthe whip\u201d among some hacky sack players."

To perform a stall, catch the sack with your foot by gently lowering your foot in a cradling motion when the hacky sack hits it. This will help absorb the impact of the bag on the foot and keep it from bouncing off the side. Stalls won\u2019t actually help you much in a game of hacky sack where the goal is to pass the sack to another player. However, they\u2019re a neat trick you can use to impress your friends! Just like with kicks, you can perform inside stalls, outside stalls, and toe stalls by changing the location on your foot where you catch the sack."

This will also help you learn to control where you want the bag to go, which is good for both performing tricks and for playing actual games. For example, to perform the Helicopter, do an inside kick, a toe kick, an outside kick, a toe kick, and another inside kick, moving the hacky sack back and forth from the front of your body to the outside. To do the Rainbow, use outside kicks to move the hacky sack from 1 side of your body to the other over your head."
