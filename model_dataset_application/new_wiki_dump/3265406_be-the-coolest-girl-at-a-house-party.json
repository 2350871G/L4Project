If someone says something you don\u2019t agree with, try not to get insulted or argue right away. Instead, tell them you never thought of it that way, and ask them to explain further.

Some experts recommend having three good stories. Just make sure that you switch them up every now and then so that people don\u2019t catch you telling the same ones over and over again.

If you\u2019re generally a bit of a rambler, and you realize you\u2019re doing it at a party, stop and check in with your audience to make sure they\u2019re still following you.

Having a healthy diet won\u2019t necessarily make you thin if you are naturally a bit larger, but it will keep you feeling healthy and energized, and able to do things to keep your body as lean and toned as possible. It may be tempting to stop eating or purge in order to lose weight, but please be kind to yourself and resist doing these things.

If you want to go more dramatic \u2014 for example, with a  smokey eye or vibrant  red lipstick \u2014 make sure that you makeup matches your outfit.

As you listen to what they say, nod and make short comments (e.g., \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cgo on\u201d) that show you\u2019re listening. When they\u2019re done, repeat the gist of what they said and ask follow-up questions. When others are speaking, resist the urge to think about what you\u2019re going to say next. Try to stay focused on what the person in front of you is saying instead. Ask for thoughts and opinions. A great way to build a bond with someone is to ask for their thoughts and opinions, and then listen non-judgementally to what they have to say. Ask follow-up questions. If someone says something you don\u2019t agree with, try not to get insulted or argue right away. Instead, tell them you never thought of it that way, and ask them to explain further. If the person expresses an opinion that offends you, consider whether you need to let them know that. For the most part, if someone is bigoted, it will be difficult to change their mind and probably not worth your time. Just politely excuse yourself and move on. Ask for advice. Appealing to another person\u2019s expertise is a way to show your respect for them and to gain their confidence. If you know someone is experienced with something you\u2019re interested in, ask them for advice on things. Just make sure that your questions are sincere. You don\u2019t want to seem like you\u2019re asking just to make conversation. Maybe don\u2019t ask a doctor about an illness you have if you meet one at a party. They\u2019re not there to work. You can, however, ask them what they do with difficult patients or about how difficult med school might have been, particularly if you want advice on scheduling your own time. Drop the ego. Put your own thoughts and needs aside when you\u2019re listening to others. Resist the urge to correct them if you think they\u2019re wrong, and definitely don\u2019t one-up them with your own story. It will just feel like you\u2019re trying to compete with them, and this will look worse on you than it does on them, even if they\u2019re wrong. Offer sincere compliments. Maybe you like a dress someone is wearing, or you love their hair cut. Tell them! Just make sure that you\u2019re honest about what you compliment them on. Be the best version of yourself. If you\u2019re usually awkward in social situations, it may feel like you have to act like someone else in order to have fun at a party. Try not to think of it as acting as someone else; instead, think of it as acting as the best version of yourself. It can feel a bit uncomfortable to practise new skills. You might even feel like you\u2019re faking it, but this is where the saying \u201cfake it till you make it\u201d rings true. With time those skills will become second nature, and you\u2019ll be happy you took the time to practise them. Being Interesting Be positive. If you\u2019re always miserable, chances are, people won\u2019t want to talk to you. Try to be positive and friendly, especially when you\u2019re talking to people you don\u2019t know very well. Avoid complaining too much or gossiping negatively about anyone. Your listeners are more likely to associate the things you\u2019re complaining about with you than with who/what you\u2019re complaining about. Ask questions. This is related to being a good listener. You can be the center of attention without talking everyone\u2019s ears off. Listen to people. Ask questions about what they say. Encouraging people to talk about themselves will make them feel special and they will likely remember the conversation as being an interesting one. If you\u2019re stuck for conversation, try asking someone about what sort of hobbies they have or what they\u2019ve recently been up to. If you know anything about the subject they\u2019re talking about, share your experience without interrupting and without trying to one-up the person. If you don\u2019t know anything about what they\u2019re talking about, ask questions. Have a few good stories. Choose a few stories that you know entertain people, and rehearse them to ensure that you don\u2019t bore your audience while you try to remember details or go off on tangents. Some experts recommend having three good stories. Just make sure that you switch them up every now and then so that people don\u2019t catch you telling the same ones over and over again. Tailor your stories to the party. The stories you tell at a career-oriented party will likely be different from the ones you tell at a party full of your close friends. Stories about people are recommended. Be concise and straightforward. Whenever you\u2019re talking, keep in mind that people have shorter attention spans than ever before. For this reason, try to keep your comments and stories short and to the point.If no one is asking questions about what you\u2019re saying, you might be boring them. If you\u2019re generally a bit of a rambler, and you realize you\u2019re doing it at a party, stop and check in with your audience to make sure they\u2019re still following you. If your listener begins to look restless or bored (checking their watch or phone, or looking around the room), stop yourself and apologize for being too chatty, and ask them something about themselves. Be a charismatic speaker. Studies have shown that body language, emotion and voice count for far more than the words you say. For this reason it\u2019s important to hone your public speaking skills and body language. When you speak, be passionate. This doesn\u2019t mean shouting or speaking loudly. It means, emphasizing your words with gestures and by changing the tone of your voice. Gather interesting life experiences. To be interesting, do interesting things. Follow your passions, take up a hobby, involve yourself with people who excite and inspire you. Looking Your Best Have good hygiene. Bathe, wash your hair, brush your teeth, clip and file your nails, and wear deodorant. Unless you struggle with a medical condition, having good hygiene will keep you smelling nice. Some medical conditions can cause people to smell bad even when they have good hygiene. If you think you might suffer from such a condition, see your doctor. You might consider using a whitening toothpaste while brushing your teeth. People with straight, white teeth are often thought to be more attractive than those without. Maintain a  healthy diet. When you drink enough water and eat healthy, unprocessed foods, it shows in your appearance. Unless you have underlying health conditions, a healthy diet should keep your skin, hair, and body looking good. Note that there are a range of healthy body types. Having a healthy diet won\u2019t necessarily make you thin if you are naturally a bit larger, but it will keep you feeling healthy and energized, and able to do things to keep your body as lean and toned as possible. It may be tempting to stop eating or purge in order to lose weight, but please be kind to yourself and resist doing these things. They are not only extremely dangerous for your body; they are also emotionally stressful. If you think you may have an eating disorder, there are many resources available for you to  get help. Look online or consult your doctor to learn more about resources in your area. Style your hair. Find a  style for your hair that  complements your face and your outfit. If you\u2019re wearing casual clothes, keep your hair more casual; if you\u2019re going more formal, a more formal hair style will be nice. Ultimately how you style your hair depends on your own tastes. Sporting a new style is a great way to get noticed at a party, especially if it\u2019s very different from what you\u2019d normally do with your hair. Do your makeup. It\u2019s not necessary to wear makeup to look good, but it can be fun to add a little boost to your natural look. If you want to keep it low-key, try just  giving your skin a creamy glow and topping it with some mascara and a nude lip color. If you want to go more dramatic \u2014 for example, with a  smokey eye or vibrant  red lipstick \u2014 make sure that you makeup matches your outfit. You probably don\u2019t want to look like Morticia Addams in blue jeans and a white T-shirt (although that could be funny). Have smooth, healthy-looking lips. A study has found that women\u2019s lips are the most attractive part of their body, particularly when they\u2019re painted red. Dress in clothes that  complement your body type. Which clothes look best on you will depend on your body type \u2014 for example, if you\u2019re smaller on top and larger on the bottom (a \u201cpear-shaped body\u201d), wearing tops that accentuate your shoulders will help your body look more balanced. Accessorize. Accessorizing is a great way to add interest to your outfit, particularly if you can\u2019t afford to buy new clothes all the time. It can also help you look more polished. As an example, you can spice up a little black dress with colorful earrings and a bracelet, and maybe draw those colors out by wearing shoes that match.",
