Cover the pot with a loose-fitting lid, then set it aside for at least 4 to 6 hours. It would be even better if you allowed them to soak overnight, about 8 to 9 hours.

Finishing the Rajma Wait for the pressure on the pressure cooker to drop, then open it.

Use a slotted spoon to take the beans out of the pressure cooker and transfer them to the masala. You will have to make several trips in order to transfer all of the beans.
