For a photograph, choose a high-resolution image, and size it based on how large you want your puzzle to be. Print it off or have it developed at a photo lab according to your specifications. For a hand-drawn puzzle image, choose a high-quality paper that\u2019s the size you want your puzzle to be. Using your favorite medium, draw or paint your image directly onto the paper. You can also create your own puzzle image on a computer, and then print it off like a photograph."

          "description":"Plywood is more durable and traditional, but this will only work if you have a saw at your disposal and are confident in your skill with that tool. Cutting out a puzzle is delicate work and requires experience. You can also use a good quality cardboard to back your puzzle. This will be much easier to work with, and can be cut with scissors. Craft-quality cardboard can be found at most craft stores. The ideal thickness for a puzzle backing, be it cardboard or plywood, is one-eighth inch (0.3 cm). Look for a piece of backing that\u2019s as close to the size of your puzzle image as possible to avoid waste. You can use the cardboard from on old box to back your puzzle, but make sure it\u2019s clean, undamaged, and flat. Thin cardboard like that from a cereal box will work for a simple puzzle, but thicker cardboard is preferable."

          "headline":"Assemble your tools.",
          "description":"Aside from the image and your puzzle backing, you will also need glue, spray lacquer, a ruler, and a pencil. For a cardboard-backed puzzle, you will need sharp scissors or a hobby knife. For a wood-backed puzzle, you will need either a coping saw (a hand saw used for intricate shapes) or a scroll saw, an electric or pedal-operated saw that\u2019s good for intricate curves. Liquid craft glue or spray glue will work best for your puzzle because it\u2019s multi-purpose and won\u2019t damage photographs. If you are using a photograph for your puzzle image, be sure to find lacquer that\u2019s safe for it."

          "headline":"Attach your image to your backing.",
          "description":"Place your backing on a sheet of wax or parchment paper to protect the surface underneath. Place it good side down. Spray or cover the surface of the backing with glue and spread it around so there\u2019s an even coat all over it. Place your picture onto the backing. Use your fingers to slide it around so it\u2019s centered and straight. With a roller or old credit card, apply even pressure to the picture to help the glue adhere and remove bubbles. Let the glue dry. Glues have different drying times, but give your puzzle several hours to set if possible."

          "description":"If your puzzle image is smaller than the backing, begin by trimming down the edges of the backing. For a cardboard puzzle, use your scissors or place your puzzle face up on a cutting mat and use your hobby knife. For a wood puzzle, use your saw to carefully trim the border so that the backing is the exact shape and size as the puzzle image. With a hand saw, place most of the puzzle on a solid, flat surface (like a table) with the side you want to cut overhanging the edge. Firmly hold the puzzle with one hand to keep it in place and use your other hand to hold the saw and cut."

Use a ruler to mark out and draw a grid pattern made up of squares that are three-quarters of an inch (for a puzzle with more, smaller pieces) or one inch (for a puzzle with fewer, larger pieces). Instead of drawing your own puzzle template, you can print off templates from sites like Tim\u2019s Printables."

You can also use inverted and protruding triangles, squares, or other shapes. For pre-drawn puzzle templates that you\u2019ve printed off, glue them on to the back of the puzzle and allow it to dry."

          "description":"For cardboard puzzles, follow the puzzle piece template you\u2019ve drawn on the back and use your scissors to cut out the pieces. Or, if you\u2019re using a utility knife, put your puzzle face down on your cutting mat and carefully cut the pieces. Or, cut out the pieces with your saw, being careful not to cut yourself. When you have finished, use an eraser to remove any remaining pencil marks. To make it easier, don\u2019t cut out pieces individually. Rather, cut entire rows or columns at a time, and then go back and cut out the individual pieces. The lacquer will help protect the image from damage as you\u2019re cutting out the pieces, and this is especially important if you\u2019re using a saw."
