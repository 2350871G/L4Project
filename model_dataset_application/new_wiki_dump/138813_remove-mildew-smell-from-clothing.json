          "description":"Plain white vinegar is a safe and natural method to remove bad odors from your laundry, including the smell of mildew. In addition to killing the bacteria that cause odor, vinegar strips away most of the product buildup that could be trapping odor in your clothes. If you like, you can use half the detergent you normally use in combination with the vinegar, as long as the detergent is not made from a natural soap. Vinegar breaks down the fats in natural soaps, such as castile soap, rendering both ineffective if the two are combined."

          "description":"Vinegar and baking soda both kill mold and mildew, but they attack different strains of these odor-causing bacteria. If you\u2019ve already tried vinegar and your clothes still smell moldy, add \u20442 cup (120 mL) of baking soda into the wash, and run the cycle with the hottest water possible. It may help to add a little vinegar into the rinse cycle after washing with baking soda."

Bridgett Price\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Co-Owner, Maid Easy\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: You can use oxygen bleach as a pre-treatment for a deeper clean. Pour a small amount of the bleach directly onto the garment, let it sit for a few minutes, and then scrub it with a brush or sponge before putting it into the washing machine."

Choose a product that has enzymes for destroying odor, then add it to your wash. Some commercial laundry detergents contain odor-fighting enzymes, or you can purchase a bottle of laundry booster that you use in addition to your regular detergent."

          "description":"After you machine wash your clothes, use clothespins to clip them to a line outside, and let the fresh air and sunlight dry your clothes naturally. Sunlight can kill some of the bacteria that create unpleasant odors on your clothes, which is why line-drying leaves clothes smelling so fresh. This method works better on natural fibers like cotton and wool than it does for synthetic fabrics like spandex or nylon. Over time, exposing your fabrics to sunlight will bleach their color."

Just place the garment in a resealable plastic bag and put the bag in the freezer overnight. It might seem unusual, but freezing their clothes is a long-time secret weapon of denim lovers who want to extend the life of their jeans."

Just pour the liquid into a spray bottle, saturate the item, and let it air-dry for the freshest result. If you\u2019re in a hurry, place the item in the dryer instead of air drying."

Place the item into a sealable plastic bag containing several tablets of activated charcoal, and leave it in there at least overnight. For really tough odors, you may need to leave the item in the bag for up to a week. You can buy activated charcoal at pet supply stores, vitamin and nutrition shops, and some big-box retail centers."
