  "text":" Using Flour Tortillas Warm a skillet to medium heat and melt butter. Warm a stainless steel skillet to medium heat. Melt 2 tablespoons (30 mL) butter in the pan. Brown each side of a flour tortilla. Warm each side of a small flour tortilla for about two minutes, until they are golden brown. Dip the warm tortilla in cinnamon and sugar. Completely cover each side of the tortilla in a cinnamon and sugar mixture. Pick each tortilla up with metal tongs or use a fork and coat each side with cinnamon and sugar spread out on a plate. Cool and form the shells. Form the taco shells by placing the warm tortillas between something to cool. Use the backside of a muffin tin or use card holders. Cool the shells completely down for 10 minutes. Dip the tortilla edges in melted chocolate. Melt 2 cups (470 mL) of semi-sweet chocolate chips in a double boiler pan or in the microwave. Dip the edges of each formed tortilla shell in the melted chocolate. If using a double boiler pan, make sure the top pan does not touch the boiling water in the bottom pan. If using the microwave, heat the chips for one minute, stir and heat for another 30 seconds. Repeat for 30 more seconds if you need to. Dip the chocolate edges in sprinkles and cool down. While the chocolate is still warm, dip the edges in sprinkles. Let the chocolate cool down and harden for 10 minutes. Scoop ice cream into the middle. Fill each tortilla shell with three scoops of vanilla ice cream. Lightly press the sides of each tortilla together to securely hold the ice cream inside. Place them in the freezer for 30 minutes. Make sure your ice cream tacos are completely frozen and solid by freezing them for at least 30 minutes. Take them out and enjoy. Using Waffles Preheat a waffle iron. Turn a waffle iron on and adjust the temperature according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Use medium-high heat for a perfectly browned taco shell. Mix batter together. Measure out ingredients for waffle batter according to the directions on a packaged pancake and waffle mix. You can also whip up your own waffle batter from scratch. Pour the batter and lightly brown the waffle. Pour about \u20442 cup (120 mL) of batter into your waffle iron, depending on how large of a style you have. Cook and lightly brown the waffle about 3 minutes, or until only a small amount of steam comes from the hot iron and batter. Form the taco shape with the help of muffin tins. It\u2019s important to start forming the taco shape of the shell while the freshly made waffles are still warm. After you\u2019re done lightly browning the waffle, fold it in half while it\u2019s still warm and hold the shape in place between the sides of an upside down muffin tin. Repeat this step as needed for however many ice cream tacos you\u2019re making. Crisp the waffles in the oven. After you fill up the bottom of muffin tins with however many shells you need to make ice cream tacos, place them in a 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) oven for about five minutes. Check them after three minutes, and take them out when the waffles are golden brown and crisp. Allow the shells to cool for 10 minutes. So you don't have to deal with melted ice cream, let your waffle shells cool down for about 10 minutes. Speed the cooling process up by placing shells in the freezer. Scoop your favorite ice cream into the shells. After your shells are formed and cool, scoop the tastiest ice cream you can think of into them. Each waffle shell will hold two to three scoops, so use a variety if you want. Lightly press the sides of your shell into the scooped ice cream. Add the toppings of your choice. What makes ice cream tacos so great is how fun it is to eat them. Make them even more fun by topping them off with drizzled caramel, chocolate chips, crushed cookies or gummy worms. Make faux sour cream by adding Cool Whip to the top. Using Pancakes Heat a nonstick or cast iron skillet. Use a nonstick griddle pan or cast iron skillet to evenly cook the shell of your ice cream tacos. Heat the pan to medium and test the temperature by sprinkling a bit of water over the surface. If the water jumps across the pan and evaporates, the pan is well heated. Mix the batter up. Stir the ingredients together according to a store-bought pancake mix or make your own batter. Make your own pancake mix recipe from scratch too. Pour batter into the skillet and brown the pancakes. Make the right-sized pancakes by pouring \u20444 cup (59 mL) batter for each pancake on your hot skillet. Brown each side of the pancakes for one to two minutes. Form the shell while pancakes are still warm. Your pancakes will be hot as you get done cooking them, but you need to start forming the taco shell when they\u2019re hot. Use a spatula or paper towels to do this if you need to. Lay the middle of each pancake over the side edges of a 13 by 9 inches (33 by 23 cm) cake pan to form a taco shape and cool them down for 10 minutes. Fill the shells up with ice cream. Scoop ice cream into the cooled and formed pancake shells. Lightly squeeze the sides of the shell to snugly hold your favorite ice cream. Place the ice cream filled shells in the freezer while you melt chocolate topping. Melt chocolate chips in the microwave. Pour 2 cups (470 mL) semi-sweet chocolate chips into a microwave safe bowl and heat them up for one minute on high heat. Stir and heat for another 30 seconds. Stir again and heat for another 30 seconds if necessary. Pour the melted chocolate over the ice cream filled shells. Take your pancake ice cream tacos out of the freezer and scoop the melted chocolate chips over them. Since some of the ice cream will start to melt from the warm chocolate, immediately place your ice cream tacos back in the freezer until they\u2019re cold again.",
