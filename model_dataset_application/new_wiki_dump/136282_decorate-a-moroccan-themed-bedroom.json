          "description":"Hang lamps made of metal and glass in your bedroom for mysterious lighting and an instantly recognizable Moroccan feel. Choose less modern styles for more of an old-world atmosphere. Get lamps with colored glass to match or complement the other colors in the room. Hang lamps or lanterns from the ceiling right over your bed, or from the frame of a four-poster canopy bed if you have one, for a cozy focal point. Try making your own lanterns or candle holders with glass jars and paint. Or, pick up string lights with round metal covers. Weave them through or around your headboard to create ambient lighting."

          "headline":"Place cushions everywhere for a cozy feel.",
          "description":"Use pillows and cushions in bright colors and patterns to adorn your bed and create soft floor seating. Combine colors, shapes, and sizes for casual vibrance. You can sit on the pillows while lounging, reading, or enjoying your morning coffee or tea. Include poufs or low ottomans, as well as rugs and throw blankets, for a cozy low-to-the-ground seating space. Spice up an old plain pillow by buying or making a pillowcase in a bright color or pattern. You can even paint on a pattern with a stencil and fabric paint."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Lay down embroidered rugs to add texture.",
          "description":"Put down rugs in rich colors and patterns on the floor to make it feel soft and inviting. A striking rug can also provide another point of focus to the room. Look for rugs that are woven, with simplistic, abstract patterns. Berber rugs, traditionally handwoven and knotted by people in the region, are still a popular style imitated by modern makers. You can also use decadent rugs as wall hangings for a soft, decorative touch. Check vintage and antique shops for rugs, and remember that the more worn, the better! They\u2019ll add a sense of character and comfort to your Moroccan-themed room."

          "headline":"Hang mosaic mirrors and paintings for a unique look.",
          "description":"Adorn the walls with mirrors, paintings, and images that evoke Morocco and the Middle East. Try mosaic mirrors for a visually unique, light-reflecting look. Make your own simple wall designs with a Moroccan-themed stencil design, paint, and watercolor paper or canvases. Think of classic Moroccan motifs, like camels or an \u201cArabian nights\u201d style, when you buy or make your wall decorations."

Mix up your bedding with different color fabrics, and have more throw blankets and pillows throughout the room. Pick curtains that extend all the way to the floor, even if the windows in your bedroom don\u2019t. Remember that everything shouldn\u2019t match exactly. The look should be cohesive, but you should use a variety of tones, colors, and textures."

Try out reds, terracotta or orange colors, yellows, and golds. Accent with cooler turquoise, silver, and greens. You can also stick to more neutral warm colors for the walls if you plan to accent with a lot of colorful tapestries, rugs, wall hangings, and cushions."

If possible, you can even create patterns with stencils or by freehand on the ceiling, reminiscent of the beautifully decorated ceilings of the East. Do the ceiling in the same shade as the walls or a lighter complementary color. Choose a lighter color to visually expand the height, or a darker one to create a closer, cozy atmosphere for the room."

Try a pattern, a complementary color, or a contrasting color. The best accent wall in a bedroom is the one behind your bed. Painting this wall creates an intimate, cozy feel. Try using a stencil to create a Moroccan-inspired pattern on your accent wall. Remember to paint the entire wall whatever color you want to show in the negative spaces of the stencil pattern, be it a white or neutral, or another warm complementary hue."

Carefully tape a stencil to one portion of the surface, paint, then move it to the next portion to keep the pattern consistent. Try out a common pattern found in Moroccan art and textiles, such as the eight-pointed star, octagon, and other repeated geometrical patterns. You can also create your own stencil by taping shapes onto a wall with painter\u2019s tape. With both this and pre-made stencils, you should always let paint dry completely before moving a stencil or removing tape."

You can also get a canopy that hangs from the ceiling to drape over the bed. Find or make a headboard for the bed that will become a statement piece for the room.

Easily match your bed frame by staining a wood table or chair with a similar shade of stain. Update an old table that doesn\u2019t match your theme by repainting it in a new color or pattern. If possible, building in a window seat or just using a low bench thoughtfully can add to the soft and comfortable low-to-the-ground seating in the room."
