Liquid bleach is sold under trademarked names like Clorox, Everchlor, Hypo, Bridos, Bleacol, and Hispec. Bleach is one of the most corrosive of all gardening tool disinfectants. If inhaled, bleach may cause damage to your nose, throat and lungs. It can also damage or irritate your skin.

Purchase the disinfectant of your choice from a horticulture or garden supply store, and follow all package directions and warnings carefully. These industrial products are formulated to kill algae, fungus, bacteria, and spores immediately on contact. A few common commercial Q-salt products are Green-Shield, Physan 20, and KleenGrow.
