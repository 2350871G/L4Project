However, there are ways you can find newspapers for craft purposes. Old newspaper is commonly recycled. If you know a neighbor who's big into recycling, try asking him or her if they have any old newspaper to spare. You may also be able to find old newspaper at the recycling bin of a local dump, but make you ask worker if taking the paper is okay. Check at your local grocery store as well. If they have day old newspapers they intend to throw out, they may be willing to give these papers to you."

To make a newspaper dress, you'll need the following supplies:\nYou will need a pen or a pencil. Make sure to get a non-toxic brand of adhesive tape. You should get a tape measure, which you can purchase at a local drugstore if you do not have one on-hand. You'll need some string. You can use shoe string, or buy a thick bundle of string at a local craft store."

Lay the pieces side-by-side and tape them together, allowing a small amount of overlap between the pieces. This will comprise the skirt portion of your dress. Use a lot of tape to make sure the pieces are securely together, taping them down on both the front and the back."

Wrap the tape measure around your waist and see how big your waist is. Write down this number. To measure your waist, grab your tape measure. Place the end of the tape measure directly on your skin, halfway between your lowest rib and the top of your hip bone. This should be more or less in line with your belly button. Breath out and wrap the tape measure around your waist, making sure it's smooth without twists or wrinkles. Write down the size of your waist before removing the tape measure. Mark your waist size on top of the taped together newspaper. For example, say your waist is 22 inches. Start at the end of one piece of newspaper and stretch the tape measure out 22 inches. Use your pen to make a small vertical line on top of the newspaper marking the 22 inch mark."

You can then add layers by taping more newspaper to the skirt. Take a piece of newspaper and place one end of it roughly in the middle of your skirt. Tape this newspaper to the skirt, using several pieces of tape to secure. Then, add more pieces of newspaper to the middle of the skirt, allowing some overlap between pieces, until all sides of the original skirt are covered with extra newspaper. The new newspapers should add length as they'll stretch down slightly below the two original newspapers. How many newspaper you'll need to layer depends on the size of your skirt. If you have a bigger waist, you'll need more newspapers. Length is optional. You can stop with one extra layer of newspapers wrapping around the skirt. If you want a longer skirt, however, add another layer. This time, tape new newspapers over the overlapping portions of newspaper you added to the original skirt. The ends of these new newspapers should be taped down about halfway between the first layer of newspaper you added."

Place one of your newspaper strips along one side of the slit at the back of your skirt. Tape the tip of the strip down on top of the slit. Then, move down about an inch and place another piece of tape across the strip. The idea is to create a series of slots along the seam of the dress, through which you'll later weave string to secure the dress in place. Keep taping down the slit of newspaper, leaving about one inch of space between pieces of tape, until you reach the end of the slit. Repeat the same process on the other side, using the other strip. Make sure the slots you create on the other side line up with slots you originally created. Then, take several pieces of string. Feed one piece of string between each slot on one side. Then, pass this piece of string through the corresponding slot on the other side. When you're ready to put on your skirt, you will tie the strings together to secure it. Later, when you want to take off your skirt, you can untie the strings."
