This technique lets the plant focus more attention on getting its roots settled. Don't worry. Once the plant is settled, it will grow back."

In other words, leaving the old fronds in place can help your fern survive through the cold of winter and return in the spring."

Look for scales on the underside of leaves along the vein or on the stems. Scales can spread, so remove any fronds you see with shears or scissors. If you have a bad infestation, you may need to throw out the houseplant so the scales don't spread to other houseplants. Outdoor ferns also get scales, but you should try controlling them with oil-based spray pesticides instead of pruning."
