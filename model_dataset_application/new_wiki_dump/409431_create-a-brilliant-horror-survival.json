      "description":"Zombies are great and all, but they've just became un-scary since everyone started using them. Take a look at the popular Survival horror game Silent Hill, and look at its original creature design. Now, take the concept of something no one's ever seen before, and implement it to your game. The enemy doesn't always have to be a creature, the enemy could be a human. Making that human scary by make them innocent and twisted, a little girl covered in blood with a deranged laugh is effective."
