      "description":"White is a popular colour for tablecloths; you shouldn't have too many issues finding one you like in a store or shop, or even online if you don't already have one. Thrift stores, second hand shops and charity shops might have interesting vintage or even antique table cloths. Your tablecloth doesn't have to be plain white fabric; you can use a damask cloth, a cloth with borderie anglaise edging, an embroidered cloth, or whatever you choose, as long as it's winter white. Make sure your chosen cloth is clean and pressed. If you want to economize, a very well-ironed white sheet folded in two may suffice."

Consider napkin rings for your winter white table. Napkin rings can be a great way to introduce your accent colour or emphasize the winter white theme. If you choose silver, gold or plain white napkin rings, consider tucking a sprig of holly or a small sprig of evergreen foliage into the napkin ring along with the napkin. If you can't match your tablecloth exactly, then you could use napkins in your accent colour. This will look better than a pure white cloth and off-white napkins."

Place a butter dish or two on the table if you are serving bread, and a bread basket or dish. If you wish, line your bread basket with a napkin. Add a salt cellar, pepper grinder, and any other condiments required. Put sauces into dishes or bowls; it's tacky to plonk the ketchup bottle on the table.

Scatter petals, real or fake, on the table. Small dried leaves, fake leaves, or evergreen foliage can also be used. Beads, pearls, sequins and small crystals can all beautify a winter white table setting."
