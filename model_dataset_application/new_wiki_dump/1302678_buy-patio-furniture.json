          "description":"A list can help remind you of your needs and prevent impulse purchases. You do not need to list the exact items you want, but you should list your general needs in terms of patio furniture. Begin by thinking about what kind of space you're hoping to create. Consider how much space you have and how many people you want to accommodate. Also think about who will be using the furniture. Do you want a kitchen area to eat outdoors on summer nights? Do you merely want to create a place to lounge outside on nice days? Do you want to host cocktail parties outdoors? Your list of needs can help guide your purchases. For a formal dining area, you need sturdy dining chairs and tables. For a casual lounge, you need lounge chairs and side tables."

          "description":"You want your furniture to match with your home to a degree. If you have existing patio furniture, you should also keep this in mind. Try to go for furniture that matches with your style so it does not look out of place on your patio. Your patio furniture should be treated like any other furniture in your home. You want styles that match with your color scheme and taste. Very formal furniture may not pair well if your home has a more laid back vibe, for example. Choose traditional furniture if your home has a traditional style, and modern furniture if your home has a modern style. You should also keep the size of your patio in mind. A very tiny patio will not look good with large, bulky furniture. Choose pieces that fit nicely into your existing space. Choose fabrics that will work well for the outdoor conditions. If there are a lot of leaves and pollen in the area, select darker fabrics that won\u2019t stain as easily as light-colored ones. Pick water-resistant furniture if the area gets a lot of rain to prevent mold."

Keep weather conditions in mind when selecting outdoor furniture. You should also consider investing in an umbrella, awning, or patio tent. If you live in an area prone to rain, you may want to invest in umbrellas. You should also look for furniture that's waterproof, or that comes with a waterproof covering. Think about storage, as well. If you live in an area that's sunny year-round, you may be able to leave your furniture out all year. However, in most areas you'll need to store furniture at least some of the year. Choose pieces that will fit into the designated storage area in your home."

Maybe you have young children, so you'll need furniture that's very durable and stain resistant. Maybe you have pets who are likely to climb on the furniture, so you'll need to choose a material that's easy to clean. Jot down any special considerations, and what this means for the type of furniture you should buy, before heading to the store. If you plan to store the furniture during part of the year, choose lightweight pieces that are easy to disassemble or move and don\u2019t take up a lot of space."

Wicker comes in a variety of colors. You can also paint wicker furniture to better match your patio's color scheme. Many different types of furniture (tables, chairs, end tables) come in wicker varieties. You should be able to find something in wicker that fits your style and color scheme. Wicker generally holds up against water. However, you should make sure your wicker is made out of polyethylene as this will be most weather resistant.

It should say somewhere on the label whether the wood is authentic. However, make sure you're buying real wood. Many patio furniture labeled as wood is actually made of synthetic materials.

Quality plastics are also very durable and resistant to many different types of weather. Plastics can be great if you're looking for patio furniture to last year round.

Iron is of a heavier weight than other varieties, so it can stand its ground during volatile weather conditions. Iron works best for year round patio furniture that does not need to be moved much throughout the year. If you live in an area where it snows during winter, iron furniture must be stored inside. Look for powder-coated, UV resistant finishes when choosing iron furniture. Ensure the traditional style of iron furniture matches the existing decor of your home."
