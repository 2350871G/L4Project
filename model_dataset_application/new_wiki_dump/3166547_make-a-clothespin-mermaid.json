  "text":" Making the Mermaid's Body Paint the clothespin. You can paint your mermaid traditional human skin colors, such as black or pinkish. Or, you can have a pastel green or lilac mermaid if you wish! Glue or paint glitter on the clothespin. Paint from the base of the clothespin until just over halfway up. Leave the top part bare (no glitter). This will be used for the mermaid's top and head. Add the mermaid bra/halter top. This part of the mermaid's outfit can be made in various ways, any of which is attached a little way under the head end of the clothespin (where you'd estimate her chest would be):\nGlue two sequins; or\nPaint on or draw two circles; or\nCut two circles from scrap fabric or paper and glue them on. Making the Mermaid's Tail Draw a semi circle onto a piece of card. Paint the card piece the same color as the glitter. Shape the semi circle like a tail fin. This will require you to cut out the middle and curve the tail sides to appear realistic. Think of leaf shapes when forming this part. Cover with glitter. Allow to dry. Glue to the base back of the clothespin. Glue onto the existing glittered part. Allow to set before proceeding. The clothespin part should be shorter than the tail fin; the edges of the tail fin should descend below the clothespin, fanned out to each side of the clothespin. Adding Hair to the Mermaid Cut 10-12 strands of yarn. Make them a good length. Balance the yarn hair over her head. Check that the hair is hanging evenly each side. Then glue in place, making sure that it doesn't cover the front of the top of the clothespin, which will be the mermaid's face. Tie her hair into two even ponytails at the sides. Either tie with the same yarn or use small hair elastics (braces bands are ideal!). You could braid the hair if preferred, or simply leave it flowing loose.
