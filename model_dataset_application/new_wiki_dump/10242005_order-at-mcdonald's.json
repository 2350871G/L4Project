Choose your preferences for each menu item you select. The touchscreen kiosk is intended to make it easy for you to make substitutions or special requests with most menu items. Look for tabs like \u201cadd sauce?\u201d, \u201cadd lettuce?\u201d, and so on when you touch on a menu item. For instance, if you want your medium fries with ketchup, you\u2019ll touch the \u201cfries\u201d tab, touch the \u201cmedium\u201d tab, and select \u201cketchup\u201d when the sauce and add-on options appear. If you make a mistake, look for a \u201cremove\u201d or \u201cgo back\u201d tab as you\u2019re ordering an item. Each time you select an item, there will be an \u201cAdd to Order\u201d or \u201cConfirm\u201d tab for you to touch. This will add the selection to your order. Confirm and complete your order. When you\u2019ve finished navigating the menu tabs and have ordered your meal, look for a tab that says something like \u201cDone\u201d or \u201cComplete Order\u201d or \u201cFinish and Pay\u201d at the bottom of the screen. When you touch this, you\u2019ll see a list of your entire order, a dialog box asking if your order is correct, and \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d tabs. If there is an error, touch on \u201cNo\u201d and you will be able to go back and make changes to your order. If everything looks right, click \u201cYes\u201d and proceed to payment. Pay for your order and get your pickup number. If you are paying by credit, debit, or gift card, you can pay right at the kiosk and get a numbered receipt. If you are paying by cash, you will likely get your numbered receipt and have to go to the counter to pay. When the number on your receipt is called or is shown on the screen at the pickup area of the counter, your order is ready! If you are going to eat on site and the restaurant has table service, the kiosk will ask you to pick up a numbered tag or an electronic tag and take it to your chosen table. When your food is ready, an employee will bring your order right to you. Using the McDonald\u2019s App to Pick Up Food Download the McDonald\u2019s app to your smartphone. You can find it in both the App Store and the Google Play Store. You\u2019ll be asked to create an account and enter in a credit card to pay for your orders. The app is free to download. For the app to work properly, you will need to give it permission to identify your current location so it can direct your orders to the nearest participating McDonald\u2019s. Navigate through the menu and select what you\u2019d like to order. You should find the exact same menu items as are available in the nearby McDonald\u2019s restaurant from which you will pick up your order. Prices and calorie counts will be displayed prominently so you can look for savings or healthier options. As you use the app, you can identify favorite menu items or standard orders. For instance, if you order a Big Mac meal nearly every time, you can set it so that it will only take a couple of clicks to send that order in. When you are finished selecting what you\u2019d like to order, authorize payment using your saved credit card. The payment won\u2019t go through until your order is completed at the restaurant, however. Check in to complete your order when you arrive at the restaurant. When you arrive at the restaurant where you\u2019ll pick up your food, click the \u201ccheck in\u201d tab to send the order to the restaurant. You\u2019ll be give a 4-digit code once you check in, and you\u2019ll use this code to identify your order at pickup. The payment will go through and your order will be prepared once you check in. McDonald\u2019s advises you not to try to order food while driving. Either wait until you reach the restaurant parking lot to choose your order and check in all at once, or pick what you\u2019ll order at home, drive to the restaurant, and check in when you there. Choose how to get your food. Once you get your 4-digit code, you\u2019ll be given 3 choices to select from. You can choose \u201cDrive-Thru,\u201d tell them your code at the ordering speaker, and pick the food up at the window. Or, you can choose \u201cCurbside,\u201d park in one of the designated pickup spaces, and wait for your order to be brought to your car. Finally, you can choose \u201cInside the Restaurant\u201d and go to the pickup counter to await your food. Because your order isn\u2019t prepared until you check in, you\u2019ll still have to wait a few minutes for your food to be ready.",
