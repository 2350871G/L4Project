Look on the box to check the square footage or square meter rating for the humidifier. Invest in a model that most closely matches your room\u2019s size. A humidifier\u2019s size rating might not exactly match your room, but you want to buy the closest size possible. For example, if your room is 500 square feet, opt for a humidifier that covers up to 600 square feet. Going too small could leave your room too dry. Generally, a compact humidifier or tabletop humidifier will work in most bedrooms, while a tower humidifier will work in an office, living room, or other shared spaces."
