  "text":" Clean the Air Conditioner Make sure the unit is turned off either at the on/off switch and unplugging it or by shutting off the circuit breaker. Servicing the a/c while it's connected to power may result in electrocution. Check the small copper pipe connecting the unit to the house. If it feels hot, the unit's coils are most likely dirty and need to be washed. Rake any leaves and debris away from the unit before you start to service an air conditioner.  Take the cover off the unit, and locate the air conditioner coils (they look like a car radiator).  Use a soft brush to brush any dirt and debris off the outside cover.  Cover the motor and wiring with a plastic sheet.  Hose down the fins, coils and inside of the unit.  Check your owner's manual. Some air conditioner units require the motor be lubricated. Do this now while your unit is open. Replace the unit cover, and turn it on to make sure it runs properly. The air conditioner filter should also be replaced every few months. It is usually located near the return air duct by the furnace. Check Air Conditioner Function Start at the unit control or thermostat. Turn the unit on and make sure it kicks in and runs properly. If the unit doesn't run, call a technician. Listen for any strange noises while the unit runs. If you hear any squealing or knocking the unit's motor and belts may need lubricating or replacing. It's best to call a certified technician to do these jobs. Check the room temperature in each of the home's rooms by carrying a hand held thermometer into the room. Leave the thermometer in the room for a few minutes to give it time to adjust and make sure all the rooms are equal in temperature. Make sure the temperature of the rooms agrees with the thermostat on your air conditioner unit as well. If they are not the same, a technician can help you diagnose and correct the problem. Look for water dripping or pooling anywhere by the air return or unit outside.  Fix Pooling Water Issues Check for leaks in the tubing where the water is pooling. If there are any cracks, holes or leaks the tube should be replaced. Find the drain where the water condensation should be draining into. There should be a floor drain near the condensation pipe located by the furnace/air conditioner central unit. Clean the drain of any debris if the water seems to be pooling on top of it.  Pour water into the condensation drain pan and watch for the condensation pump to start working. The pump should activate and pump the water out and to the drain.
