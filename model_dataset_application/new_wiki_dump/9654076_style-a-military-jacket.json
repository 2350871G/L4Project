          "description":"In colder months, a great way to go casual with the military jacket is to wear it over a plaid flannel shirt. You can spice up the look with a variety of different plaid colors \u2013 reds and greens or even brighter pinks and oranges. Try tucking the flannel into your pants for an even more casual streetwear look."

          "headline":"Wear it over distressed jeans and a graphic tee for a laidback look.",
          "description":"This is a classic, casual look. Your military jacket will look great worn open and loose over a graphic tee (or even a plain white t-shirt), paired with distressed jeans. Try wearing different colors of t-shirts with the jacket, but keep in mind that more neutral colors will probably work best."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Roll up the sleeves.",
          "description":"A great way to add some flare to your old trusty military jacket is to roll up the sleeves. Roll the sleeves in large, bulky cuffs or smaller, well-defined cuffs that are more meticulous. Try pairing this over a colorful undershirt so that color peeks out from underneath the rolled jacket sleeves."
        },

          "headline":"Wear your military jacket like an oversized shirt.",
          "description":"Button or zip your military jacket all the way up and throw it on with a pair of jeans or leggings, just as you would with an oversized blouse or t-shirt. You can wear another shirt underneath, but try not to let it peek out the bottom or top of your military jacket. This is a fun, relaxed style that works well when you\u2019re on the go!"

          "headline":"Pop the collar.",
          "description":"Wear your military jacket open or closed and pop the color for a bit of extra flare. The popped collar is a fun contradiction to the strict adherence to rules that a military uniform is typically associated with. This kind of dichotomy can be a fun statement about your own personal style!"

Avoid longer military jackets for this look, as it works best with a contrast in length \u2013 the dress hanging lower than the jacket. Try completing the ensemble with a thin brown belt worn at waist-level over the top of the jacket and the dress."

          "description":"For a slimmer, more professional look, pair a tailored military jacket with a nice pair of slacks. Wear the jacket over a dressy blouse that is tucked into your slacks. This look is great for a business casual look with a little edge that\u2019s appropriate to wear to work."

          "headline":"Tuck your military jacket into your pants.",

This might not work if your military jacket is made of material that is very thick. But if your jacket is a bit on the lighter side, it\u2019s a fun way to change it up!"

Mid-calf or knee-high boots look stylish with a skirt that hits just above the knee and a fitted military jacket. Try wearing complimentary colors, like brown boots and a hunter green skirt, with your military jacket."

Under the military jacket, you can pair dressier shoes with jeans, slacks, or even tights and a cute dress. This is also a fun way to turn your daytime jacket look into a nighttime jacket look. Adding heels (or, for men, nice dress shoes) adds a more formal flare/style."

Try a small handbag with a long chain shoulder strap or a dainty little bowler bag with no over-the-shoulder straps, just handles. Avoid large cross-body bags, as the military jacket is already relatively bulky."

If you want to class it up a bit, wear a fedora hat with the outfit. You can even wear a panama hat to add some edgy contrast to the outfit."
