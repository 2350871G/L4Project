Simply leave the teabags in the water for 2-3 minutes longer than usual to account for the loss of effectiveness. You should not reuse teabags in this manner more than once or twice. If you are not planning on reusing them right away, put them in the refrigerator in enough water to keep them completely wet. Storing used teabags at room temperature or in dry conditions can cause mold growth and invite unwanted bacteria."

Place old teabags in the water you are using to boil pasta or rice for added flavor. Add old teabags to the water you have just used to boil eggs for added flavor and color.

If you are not yet satisfied with the results, you can re-wet the teabag and use it again in the exact same way.
