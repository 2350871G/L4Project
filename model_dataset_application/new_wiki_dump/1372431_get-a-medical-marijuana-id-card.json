For example, in Colorado, a medical marijuana patient can possess no more than 2 ounces (57 g) of marijuana and cultivate no more than 6 plants. In other states, such as Illinois, patients are not allowed to grow their own marijuana. There may also be restrictions on where and how you can use marijuana. For example, in Pennsylvania, a medical marijuana patient can\u2019t smoke marijuana, use it in a public place, use or possess it on school grounds, or give it to anyone else. It\u2019s illegal to drive or operate heavy machinery while under the influence of marijuana, even in places where marijuana use is legal."
