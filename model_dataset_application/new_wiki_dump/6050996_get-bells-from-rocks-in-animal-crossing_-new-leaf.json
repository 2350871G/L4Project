      "description":"Head to the Nookling Store\u2014north, past the train station, and follow the cobblestone under the arch. The Nookling Store can be found to the left. Check the center shelf where the tools are displayed. If you find a shovel on the shelf, stand in front of it and hit the \u201cA\u201d button. Timmy or Tommy will ask if you want to buy the shovel. Purchase the shovel for 500 bells. If there is no shovel, you will have to either wait for a day to pass, or if you\u2019re in a hurry, manually change the date yourself. To change the date, save the game and go to the start screen. Talk to Isabelle and ask to change the date."

Continue striking the rock as fast as you can. The more you hit the rock, the more bells you will earn. If the rock you hit is not a money rock, find another rock, dig a hole behind you, and hit it. Repeat this process until you hit the jackpot."

To add the bells to your wallet, stand over them and hit \u201cY.\u201d When you have added the bells to your inventory, open up the menu with the \u201cX\u201d button, and use your stylus to drag the money icons to your main bell supply, which is located above your inventory on the right."
