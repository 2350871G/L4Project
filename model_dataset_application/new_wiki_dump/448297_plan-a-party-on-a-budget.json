Christina Millikin\t\t\tFounder & CEO, Glow Events\t\t\t\tWhen you're setting your budget: Start with a total budget that you can spend on the party. Then, make a budget for every single category of vendor that you need, like the venue, caterer, florist, musicians, and so on. The totals for each of those categories should add up to your total budget. That way, when you're interviewing vendors, it will be easy to see whether they're in your price range, or if you need to expand your budget or go with another vendor."
