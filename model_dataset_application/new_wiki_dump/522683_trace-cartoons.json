Make sure you have enough light so that you can see the image that you are trying to trace. Use a pencil to trace the outside. Then add the details.

Tape the original art work to a panel with a back light. This could be a regular window with enough daylight shining through it. Tape another piece of paper on top of the original artwork.  Then start your tracing.  When you are finish, remove everything off the window or backlit panel.  Method Three This is one of the most convenient methods. This method is similar to Method Two, but has a few different steps. In this method, you will utilize your computer or TV display for tracing the image. Do exactly what Method Two tells you, with the exception of not having the original paper taped on a backlit source, instead, load or freeze an image on your display.
