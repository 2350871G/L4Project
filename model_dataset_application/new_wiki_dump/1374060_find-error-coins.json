On portraits, check on the details like chin, mouth, ears and eyes, doubling often also occur on these areas. Rim of coins should also be inspected where abnormalities also sometimes occur."

If orientation changes, then the coin is considered valuable. The government takes great care when it comes to correct orientation to prevent error coins reaching circulation. This is why you should make it a habit to check orientation of coins every time you hold one with the simple over-the-top-turn technique."
