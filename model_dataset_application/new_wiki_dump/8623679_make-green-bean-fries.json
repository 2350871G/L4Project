  "text":" Boiling the Beans Fill a bowl with ice water. To stop the green beans from cooking after you boil them, you need to place them in an ice water bath. Find a bowl that\u2019s large enough to hold \u00bd pound (227 g) of green beans and fill it with cold water and some ice. Make sure to place the bowl close to the stove so you can quickly place the green beans in it after you\u2019ve finished cooking them. Bring the broth to a boil. Add 2 cups (473 ml) of low-sodium chicken broth to a large saucepan. Heat the broth on the stove over high heat until it comes to a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes. You can use homemade chicken broth in place of a store-bought version if you prefer. Add the beans and cook them until tender. Once the broth comes to a boil, place the \u00bd pound (227 g) of trimmed green beans into the pan. Let the beans cook until they are tender, which should take approximately 5 minutes. If the pan seems like it might boil over, lower the heat slightly to reduce the boil. Transfer the beans to the ice water. When the beans are cooked, use a slotted spoon to lift them out of the boiling water. Immediately, place them in the bowl of ice water to stop the beans from cooking. Drain and dry the beans. Allow the beans to cool completely in the ice water, which should take 10 to 15 minutes. When they\u2019re cooled, drain them in a colander and gently pat dry with a clean towel. When the green beans are dry, place them in a bowl and set them aside for the moment. Preparing the Fry Coating Combine the egg and milk. Add a large egg and \u00bd cup (118 g) of milk to a shallow bowl. Whisk the two together until they\u2019re completely blended. It\u2019s best to use whole or at least 2% milk in the batter. Add some of the flour to a shallow bowl. Place a second shallow bowl beside the egg and milk mixture. Fill it with \u00bd cup (50 g) of instant flour. Instant flour is a finely milled flour that helps give the green bean fries\u2019 coating a flakier texture. If you don\u2019t have instant flour, you can substitute all-purpose flour. Mix the breadcrumbs, remaining flour, and seasonings. In a third shallow bowl, combine the remaining \u00bd cup (50 g) of instant flour, 1 cup (90 g) of breadcrumbs, \u00bc teaspoon (\u00bd g) of onion powder, 1 teaspoon (\u2153 g) of garlic powder, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

You can add other spices or seasonings to the breadcrumb mixture if you like. Paprika and chili powder are some options to consider. Line a baking sheet. To have a place to set the green beans down once they are coated in the batter, place a baking sheet beside the stove. Line it with parchment paper so the beans won\u2019t stick to it. You can substitute silicone baking mat for the parchment paper. Coating the Beans Toss the beans in the flour. When you\u2019re ready to start coating the green bean fries, place the beans in the bowl with the plain flour. Mix the beans with the flour until they are fully coated. Make sure to shake off the excess flour from the green beans so you don\u2019t get clumps when you add the rest of the coating. Dip them into the egg and then into the breadcrumb mixture. Once the green beans are coated with flour, dunk them in the egg mixture. Next, toss them in the breadcrumb mixture until they are well coated. Allow the excess egg mixture to drip off the green beans before coating them with the breadcrumbs. Transfer the beans to the baking sheet and freeze them to set the coating if frying. After the green bean fries are coated, place them on the lined baking sheet. If you plan to fry the beans, cover the cookie sheet with plastic wrap and chill them in the freezer until the coating is set, which should take approximately 30 minutes. If you plan to bake the green bean fries, you don\u2019t need to chill them. You can go right to cooking them. Frying the Beans Heat the oil until it reaches the proper temperature. Fill a deep, heavy-bottomed pot with 3-inches (8-cm) of peanut oil. Heat the oil on the stove over medium until a deep fry thermometer registers 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). You can substitute vegetable oil for the peanut oil if you prefer. If you don\u2019t have a deep fry thermometer, you can use a candy thermometer. Be careful when heating the oil. If it gets too hot, it can splatter and burn the skin. Fry the green beans in batches until they are golden brown. Once the oil reaches the right temperature, add the green bean fries to the pot in batches. Allow the green bean fries to cook until they are golden brown, which should take 1 to 2 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to gently move the beans around as they\u2019re frying to ensure that they cook evenly. Drain the fries on paper towel-lined plate. When the fries are finished cooking, use a slotted spoon to carefully remove them from the oil. Transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb some of the excess oil. Serve the fries while warm. When the green bean fries are drained, place them on a serving platter. Pair them with ranch dressing or your favorite dipping sauce, and serve while they are still warm. Simple ketchup also works well with green bean fries, as do spicier dipping sauces, such as sriracha mayonnaise. Baking the Fries Preheat the oven. To ensure that the oven is warm enough to bake the green bean fries, it\u2019s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully preheat. Bake the fries until they are crisp and golden brown. Place the baking sheet with the fries in the heated oven. Allow the fries to cook until they are crispy and golden brown, which should take 15 to 20 minutes. Halfway through the cooking time, turn the fries over to ensure that they bake evenly. Transfer the fries to a platter and serve. When the fries are finished baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Place them on a large platter or plate, and serve while they are still warm. Any leftover baked green bean fries can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 4 days.",
