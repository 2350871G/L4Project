      "description":"To play Flight Rising, you will first need to create an account. Creating an account will grant you your own lair, deity and starter dragons (Often called Progens). Choose a cool username. Don't choose something boring and forgettable, like \"Potato123\" or \"Bob.\" Instead, choose a creative name that others will wish they had thought of! It can be something involving a fandom you are in, a celebrity you love, or something that describes you. Pick a password you feel confident about. You want to be sure that nobody will be able to hack onto your Flight Rising account. Choose something with letters, numbers, and symbols, but make sure it's not too complicated to remember. You might want to write it down or get a passwords app, to make sure you won't forget it. Choose a flight that relates to your interests. If you are interested in fire, than join the fire flight. If you love swimming, maybe the water flight is your calling. You can only change your flight once every six months, so choose wisely! Pick an attractive first dragon, with pretty colors and a cool name. If you can't come up with a good name, then the name generator is there to help you out. You're going to breed this dragon, so you want to give it colors that you will willingly pass on to other dragons."

      "headline":"Breed your first two dragons.",
      "description":"If they're two different species they can conceive up to 5 eggs, while same species couples have an egg cap of 4. The colours of your hatchlings depend on the Flight Rising colour wheel, where the parent's colours create a range of colours."

      "headline":"Expand your collection.",
      "description":"In Flight Rising, there are multiple different ways to obtain new dragons. Find giveaways and sales on the forums. Older players will often give out their unwanted dragons to new players (> 1-month-old accounts) to free up space and give them to a good home. Specific sales are usually dealt through the trade system but advertised through forum posts. Auctions are a different method of selling dragons and are a fairly expensive way of obtaining dragons but can sell rarer dragons. Explore the auction house. The auction house has a circulating economy, with hatchlings being sold for as low as 3000 treasure/ 3 gems, and adults being sold for lower than 7000 treasure/ 8 gems."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Earn treasure.",
      "description":"Treasure is the primary currency of Flight Rising and is used to buy dragons, art, eggs and almost everything on Flight Rising. Treasure is primarily measured in T or KT for larger increments. 1KT = 1,000 Treasure and so on. The fairgrounds is full of minigames and you can easily earn up to 75KT each day. Other people may not enjoy the grind, so thankfully there are other, community-based methods to earn treasure. Offer services to the community. The forums are where a lot of profits are made if you know where to look. The subforums Creative Corner, Adoptables and Art Sales sell art, writing, and adoptables for treasure, gems, and USD. You can also sell other services like leveling dragons in the Coliseum, exchanging gems to treasure or vice versa, and renting your nest. Participate in Flight Dominance. Dominance is a weekly competition where a flight can reign supreme over others and gain bonuses based on their rank."
