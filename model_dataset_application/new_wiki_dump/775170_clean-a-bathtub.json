Otherwise, use a cup or small bucket to pour water around. If you have a lot of hair and debris in your tub, it's best to wipe it away with a paper towel before you rinse the tub using your shower head. Otherwise, you may accidentally clog up your drain. If your drain does get clogged, you'll also need to clean it in addition to the rest of your bathtub."

Cut a grapefruit in half. Cover the open half with salt. Sprinkle salt on the wet tub. Scrub the tub with the grapefruit, releasing juice as you go. You may need to switch to another half to scrub away all the grime in your bathtub. You may even need more than one grapefruit. Rinse away any salt and pulp."

Mix 1 cup of baking soda with 1/2 cup of Castile soap and a few drops of peppermint or tea tree essential oil. Use the mixture on a sponge to scrub down your tub. It works especially well on soap scum. Rinse it away when your tub is clean."

Then, use a sponge to apply the paste to the areas you want to clean. Scrub the paste into the surface to help remove the stains. Finally, rinse away the paste. If your bathtub is very dirty or stained, apply the paste onto the affected areas, then spritz over it with white vinegar. Allow the baking soda and vinegar to set on the stain for 10-15 minutes, then scrub with a sponge. Finally, rinse away the baking soda and vinegar. This should remove the stains."

Additionally, it's helpful to use a toothbrush or grout brush to get into the nooks and crannies, as well as around the faucets.
