          "description":"The flow rate is how much water comes out of each fixture in your home, normally expressed in gallons or liters per minute. Write down any fixtures that you run hot water through simultaneously. For example, you may need to run hot water from 1 kitchen sink and 1 shower at the same time. If you still have manuals from each water fixture, search through it to find the specific flow rate. Otherwise, turn the fixture on full blast for 10 seconds and fill a container. Use a liquid measuring cup to find the volume of the water in the container and multiply the result by 6. Add together the flow rate for each fixture you need to run at the same time to find the minimum rate your water heater needs to run. For example, if you collect \u20444 gallon (0.95 L) in 10 seconds, your equation would be \u00bc x 6 = 1 \u20442 gallons (5.7 L) per minute. Only add the flow rates for the fixtures that use hot water simultaneously. For example, if you have 2 showers but only use one at a time, you only need to find the flow rate for one of them.Typical Flow Rates for FixturesSinks: \u20442\u20131 gallon (1.9\u20133.8 L) per minuteShowers: 1 \u20442\u20132 \u20442 gallons (5.7\u20139.5 L) per minuteDishwashers: 1 gallon (3.8 L) per minuteWashing Machines: 1 \u20442 gallons (5.7 L) per minuteThese values will vary depending on the types of fixtures you have installed in your home."

Subtract the groundwater temperature from 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C) to find out how much your water heater needs to change the temperature and write down your answer. For example, if your groundwater is 45 \u00b0F (7 \u00b0C), then the equation will be 120 - 45 = 75 \u00b0F (24 \u00b0C) temperature difference."
