          "description":"Black beans grow best in soil that has a pH of 6.0-6.5. Get a home pH test kit at your local garden center, or bring in a sample of your soil for testing. If your soil pH is too low or too high, you may need to amend it. If the pH is too low, you can raise it by adding some lime. If it\u2019s too high, you can add some sulfur. Amending your soil\u2019s pH can take several months, so plan ahead and test your soil well before you plant your beans. Since it's so difficult to change the pH of your soil, you might consider growing your beans in a raised bed if your soil isn't right. Alternatively, you could grown a different bean."

However, if you\u2019ve grown other plants, especially other bean plants, on the same plot, it may be a good idea to enrich your soil with a bit of organic fertilizer before planting. Select a fertilizer with a low-nitrogen content for ideal bean production. Since it's a vegetable, giving black bean plants too much nitrogen can cause your plants to produce lots of leaves and only a few beans."

Your soil temperature should reach at least 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C) before planting. Your beans should germinate in 10-14 days, and will reach maturity in about 100 days.

You can use mycorrhizal fungi as an inoculate to help the roots form and to help the plant with nitrogen fixation. You can apply some inoculants by pouring the beans into a bag with the inoculant and shaking gently to coat the beans. Others must be mixed into the soil before planting. Follow the directions on the product package."

Make sure your beans are spaced far enough apart so that they have room to spread out as they grow. Cover your beans with a light layer of soil (enough to fill the planting holes or furrows) after planting. Give your beans a little extra space (at least 6 inches or 15 cm) between each plant if they are a bush variety as opposed to a vining variety. Sow your beans with the eyes facing down."

You can harvest the pods while they are still green, but you will need to let them mature and dry completely before you can remove the beans inside. Black beans generally reach maturity and are ready for harvest 90-140 days after planting. If your black bean plant is a bush variety, all the pods should mature at the same time.

If you\u2019re not totally sure that the pods are mature, break one open and see if the beans inside are dry and black (immature beans will be moist and paler in color). You can also try biting down on a bean. If it\u2019s dry and ready to harvest, your teeth won\u2019t leave a dent. You can harvest immature or fresh beans before they are fully dry, but you can't store them for as long. Try to harvest your beans during dry weather.
