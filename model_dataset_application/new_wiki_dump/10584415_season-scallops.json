Garnish with the chopped parsley and serve immediately. Cooked scallops will keep in the fridge for 1-2 days, if they're sealed in airtight containers or carefully wrapped in aluminum foil. Grilled Grapefruit, Orange, and Scallop Kabobs Grate the orange peel to make a zest. Shred the peel of one of the oranges through a grater to create a pile of shavings. Set this aside. Cut the oranges and grapefruits. Cut one of the oranges and one of the grapefruits in half. Squeeze the juice out of them and set it aside.

Cheese and Butter Baked Scallops Pour the melted butter into a casserole dish. Put the scallops inside. Make sure the scallops are evenly spaced and coated in the butter. Create the gratin crust.
