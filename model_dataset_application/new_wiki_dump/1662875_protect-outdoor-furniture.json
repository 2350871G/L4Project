Some forms of paint can even protect against heat and water. Choose an oil paint with a spray-on sealer. Paint on outdoor furniture tends to chip and peel when used regularly, so you will need to reapply the paint once or twice every year. Another method is to sand it, then apply an oil or stain to protect the wood."

          "description":"This will prolong the aesthetic beauty of your furniture, especially if you have a lot of wooden furniture. Water repellents help prevent water from soaking into your furniture, and they also quicken the evaporation of moisture from within the wood. This reduces the chance that your furniture will warp, weaken, or rot. Apply a sealer coat of polyurethane after using a stain or water repellant. This will make it last longer. Keep in mind that stain and water repellents typically need to be reapplied every 2 to 3 years for maximum protection. When choosing a repellent, avoid repellents with high oil percentages. High amounts of oil will promote the sticking of particles to your furniture, which can detract from their appearance."
