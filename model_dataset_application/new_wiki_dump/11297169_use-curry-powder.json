This includes dishes that simmer for a while on the stove or that are cooked using a crockpot. If you\u2019re trying to whip up a meal quickly, maybe save the curry powder for later. An exception to this would be if you\u2019re using curry powder as a dry rub. Try using curry powder in dishes like butter chicken with curry powder used as part of a marinade, or pasta where the curry powder is infused into the boiling water.
