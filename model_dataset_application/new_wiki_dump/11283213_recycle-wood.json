Pull out nails with the claw end of a hammer and take out screws with a screwdriver. If you aren\u2019t able to remove the fasteners, you may need to take the wood to a landfill instead. Check the wood over to make sure it\u2019s clean. Take apart any connected pieces so you can bundle it together after you ensure it is ready for recycling. Some places will take whole pieces of furniture and other items for recycling. For more information, check the rules of recycling services in your area."

Clear the cut wood of dirt, stone, and other debris. Finish by tying it into a bundle using twine or string. Wood scraps from construction and demolition projects can be treated as yard waste and recycled as long as they are untreated and unpainted. If you wish to save big branches for yourself, rent a wood chipper from a hardware store. Use it to make mulch. Submit painted and treated wood whole, if possible, to avoid the hazards of cutting it. Furniture can also be difficult to dismantle, so try to find a place that accepts whole pieces."

Talk to someone at the facility before unloading the wood and moving it inside. During a home pickup, you should sort the wood according to the recycler\u2019s specifications. That usually means putting yard waste into a paper waste bag, then tying sticks and boards together."
