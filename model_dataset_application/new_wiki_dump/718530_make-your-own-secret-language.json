This is a great way to create a new language, because you can use letters that you and your friends already know. Some letters can remain the same if you'd like, or you can change every letter. For example, you can substitute each letter with the letter directly after it (A=C, B=D, C=E, D=F). This would be much easier to understanding in writing, because you could decode it. Speaking this language may be more difficult. You could also substitute every letter except for the vowels. For example, H=J because I(the letter in between) is a vowel. This will make it much easier if you want to be able to speak this language."

This will allow each word in your language to have a vowel, making the language much easier to understand and pronounce when speaking. The language is simple enough for you and your friends to easily learn, but difficult enough for an unfamiliar listener or reader to not understand what you're saying. For example, \"I love you\" would become \"O luvi yua.\" Another example would be \"Hello, how are you?\" turning into \"Hillu, huw eri yua?\""
