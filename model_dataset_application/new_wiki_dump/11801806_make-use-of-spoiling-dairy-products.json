Let the milk cool until it's comfortable to touch, then take out 1 cup (240 ml) of the warm milk and mix it with 1 cup (0.24 l) of commercial yogurt with active cultures. Stir the whole mixture back together in the Dutch oven, then put it in your oven with the light on to set up for 4 hours or overnight. Once the milk is set, pour off any whey from the top, then transfer it to a container and keep it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. The longer the yogurt sits, the thicker it will be, and the more tart the flavor will be. The commercial yogurt will act as a starter, introducing the live cultures that will turn the rest of the milk into yogurt."

Continue until you've dissolved all of the lye in the milk. Try using a potato masher to mix the lye into the milk, although a large spoon will work if you don't have one. It's normal for the milk to turn yellow, tan, or orange. However, if it turns dark brown, the lye has scorched the milk, and you'll need to start over."
