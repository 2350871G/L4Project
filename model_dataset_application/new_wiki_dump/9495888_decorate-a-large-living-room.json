Get rid of the pieces that don\u2019t fit your vision and purchase new pieces that stay true to your style. If you can\u2019t afford to get several new pieces at once, keep your current furniture and accessories and replace one at a time over the course of several months. To save money, consider changing the pieces you can without replacing them. For instance, you could paint an old boring dresser that you have a bright color or change the upholstery on your dining room chairs to better fit your style. You can also repurpose items to fit your needs. For instance, instead of buying a new coffee table, make one out of crates or a large trunk."

For instance, if you\u2019re always planning your next trip and are passionate about seeing the world, you may want to go for a boho world-traveler theme that incorporates bright worldly colors, antique furniture, and organic textures, such as wooden stools and leather poufs. Some other styles you may consider include:\nTop-notch tastemaker: classic designer pieces, neutral backdrop, and high-tech gadgets.

          "description":"Since your living room is big, it probably can\u2019t be lit properly with just one central light source. During the day, take advantage of windows and keep the curtains or blinds open. Use 2-3 unique lamps near the corners of the room to enhance the central light source and make the evenings feel cozy for guests. Consider keeping 2 identical table lamps on side tables located on either side of your biggest couch. Then, put a floor lamp that is made of the same materials, or contains the same colors, in a corner on the other side of the room. If you have a fireplace but don\u2019t use it, fill it with candles and light them for extra brightness and ambience."

Since you want to do the opposite, go with a warmer color palette that includes reds, oranges, and/or yellows. Get curtains, lamps, wall art, and throw pillows and blankets in these colors. For example, you could get a set of solid mahogany curtains and 2-3 apricot throw pillows that have mahogany appliques or tassels on them."

          "description":"Texture is important because it adds dimension to a space, which is especially important when you have a lot to work with. Specifically, rough textures help a room feel more intimate and grounded, so try to incorporate several rough-textured pieces into your living room. Toss a few wool throw pillows onto your couch and/or keep a tree branch candle holder centered on your coffee table to add in some rough texture. To create a focal point, choose a textured couch or a large chair paired with a jute ottoman."

          "description":"A large patterned rug can split up space and add personality to your room. Place it near your main sitting space underneath the coffee table and between or underneath your couches. Once again, choose patterns, textures, and colors that fit with your personal decor style, and make sure the size of the rug is proportionate to the size of the space. Consider getting a unique Persian or oriental rug, such as a Kazak rug or an Aubusson rug. These are typically very colorful and detailed."

Purchase curtains that are well-tailored and made of a fabric that has unique details to make your living room feel inviting. Pick colors and textures that fit with your specific style. For instance, you may choose a red, orange, and purple aztec pattern for your curtains if your style is laid back boho, or you might choose a simple black and white geometric pattern if your style is more modern. For a bold, but polished, look, layer sheer curtains under a heavier panel."

Position your curtain rod about 20 inches (51 cm) above the top of your window, or about halfway between the top of the window and the ceiling, to bring a bold attractiveness to your living room."

Make sure they go along with the rest of your decor, whether it\u2019s classic, modern, or another style. Wall art can fill up some of that overwhelming wall space and provide your room with a warm ambiance. If your style is more traditional, go for a classic portrait or landscape painting. If you want to keep the decor more modern, go for an abstract piece that displays interesting shapes and colors. To create a gallery wall, arrange 3 or more paintings, drawings, or photographs on a single wall."

This works best in groups of 3 because it isn\u2019t too many of one thing, but it helps the room to look relatively uniform and cohesive. Put 1 throw pillow on 1 couch, another identical throw pillow on a 2nd couch, and then a 3rd one on a big chair. You can also do this with small book shelves, lamps, and more."

This may bring a refreshing earthiness to the room and also help break up the vertical space. Make sure you choose a plant that does well indoors with little sunlight, or go with a location that\u2019s near a couple of windows. Feel free to choose a faux plant, if desired."

Place decorative screens and consoles near the center of the room to help make all activity spaces in the room feel desirable. One of the best places for a console is right up against the back edge of a couch. However, you shouldn\u2019t divide up the space if you plan to use for a single purpose."

With these pieces, create sitting areas for large groups, small groups, and couples. Consider getting 3 couches, adding several sitting chairs, and/or getting 1 hard and 1 soft coffee table. Make a larger sitting area with a sofa and a few chairs, but then add in some window nooks and card tables as well for pairs to utilize. Create a reading nook in the corner of the room with a comfortable chair, side table, and lamp. This gives the corner a purpose in addition to making the room feel fuller."
