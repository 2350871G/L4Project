Using only one sheet of foil will make your foil packet more susceptible to rips, so tear off two sheets of equal size. They should be large enough that you can place the mushrooms in the middle and still fold all the ends up. Place 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter on the foil. Separate the butter so that you have two 1-tablespoon (14 g) pieces of butter. Space them a few inches apart on the foil so that it spreads evenly as it begins to melt. Place the mushrooms in the center of the foil. Add in any other ingredients you want to cook with them, such as sliced onions, tomatoes, or a piece of fish. At this point you can also add seasoning, like salt, pepper, or garlic. Fold the edges of the foil up together. Fold two opposite edges up until they meet, then pinch them together and roll the joined edges down. Next, roll up the two open ends by folding them each in a few times. This should create a completely sealed packet. Bake the foil packet for 15 minutes at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Bake mushrooms alone or with other vegetables for 15 minutes. If you are baking the mushrooms along with meat or fish, you may need to increase the amount of cook time.
