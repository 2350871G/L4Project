Rural and outdoorsy areas are fantastic, as you want as many places to hide as possible. A large backyard with lots of obstacles will also work."

So make a plan with your team\nGet a large number of players. 10 on 10 is great, but as long as you have at least one person to fight, you'll have fun. A proper team includes 7-8 players. The more players you have the more room you should have so that no one is crowded."

If you have new people, just make them shadow your best fighters. Also, arrange the formation of the players that are playing with you. There are plenty of good formations. Always try to split up into groups of two or more unless someone is a scout."

Remember, blasters are not everything if you are good at Nerf and have good skills you will be able to win with any blaster. A good primary is the Nerf Stryfe with a few 18-dart magazines for it. A good secondary would be the Strongarm or Hammershot. Try making a holster for a Retaliator or Hammershot. If you are not good at sniping but are good on offense and strong, consider using a modified flywheel blaster. They may not be quiet, but they are quick and accurate, easily allowing you to stop anyone trying to eliminate you."
