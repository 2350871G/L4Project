          "description":"To make a juice, you'll need fresh produce and something to extract the juice from the fruits and vegetables. A juicing machine is the most convenient way of making juice, because it\u2019s designed to separate the juice from the pulp and flesh. If you don\u2019t have a juicer, you can also use a blender to make juice. Once all the fruit and vegetables have been pureed, you can press the smoothie through cheesecloth to extract the juice. You can either work from a recipe to make your juice, or you can improvise with some of your favorite fruits and veggies. It\u2019s important to work with fresh produce, because frozen fruits and vegetables won\u2019t juice properly."

This is because the juicer will separate and remove these parts for you. However, you do have to remove thicker skins, seeds, and pits from certain fruits and vegetables. Remove thick skins from fruits like pineapple, mango, papaya, citrus fruits, and melons. Remove the pits from fruits like cherries, peaches, nectarines, mangos, and plums. Remove shells from any nuts and seeds that you want to juice."

          "description":"Most juicers are designed to handle large chunks of fruit and vegetable, so some produce can even be left whole. Large and medium produce should be cut into more manageable pieces:\nFor large fruits and vegetables, chop them into two inch (five cm) cubes. This includes things like cabbage, pineapple, and watermelon. Medium fruits and vegetables, like apples, tomatoes, and beets, should be cut into quarters. Small and skinny produce like carrots, celery, asparagus, radishes, berries, and kiwis can be juiced whole."

          "description":"Juicing machines often come with multiple components. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to put your juicer together. Most juicers follow a similar assembly process, which includes:\nFit the juicing bowl into the center of the juicer. This will catch the produce and separate the juice and pulp. Insert the auger into the juicing screen and the screen into the holder. Place the assembled component inside the juicing basket. Place the lid on the juicer, and position a pitcher or cup beside the spout to catch the juice."

Insert the pusher into the chute and press it down all the way to push all the produce through the screen. Remove the pusher and add another small batch of the same ingredient. When you\u2019ve finished with your first ingredient, move on to the next. As you juice, make sure you adjust the speed setting depending on the type of produce you're juicing.

When you\u2019ve blended all the ingredients and there are no large chunks left, pour the smoothie into a cheesecloth or fine-mesh strainer.

          "description":"The fiber contained in the flesh of the fruit or vegetable is removed in the juicing process, and this can lead to spikes in your blood sugar when you drink juice. Because vegetables have less sugar than fruits, it\u2019s better to drink juices that are primarily vegetable-based. Good vegetables for juicing include carrots, tomatoes, celery, cucumber, spinach, kale, broccoli, beets, cabbage, sweet potatoes, radishes, and peppers. Many vegetables make tasty juices, even if you don\u2019t like eating those vegetables whole. For slightly sweeter juices, add one or two fruits to your vegetable juices. Fruits like pears and apples will add sweetness without adding a lot of fruit flavor."

          "headline":"Consider a variety of fruits.",
          "description":"Juices in the grocery store can be pretty basic, and many people often just see things like orange, grape, cranberry, and apple juice. But you can juice just about any fruit or vegetable you like, and the more variety you eat, the more nutrients you'll get. Fruits like kiwis, strawberries, pomegranates, mangoes, papayas, apricots, plums, and peaches are great juicing candidates. Bananas, avocados, and other creamy fruits tend to clog juicers. If you want to juice these types of produce, use the a blender to puree the fruit and then strain out the juice."

          "headline":"Add herbs, seeds, and nuts to your juices.",
          "description":"Herbs add new flavor and provide additional nutritional benefits to juices. The moisture in seeds and nuts gets converted to creamy substance when the fiber is removed, resulting in a richer juice that's more filling. Consider adding a fresh flavor to your juice by incorporating fresh mint, lemon balm, rosemary, basil, dill, or other herbs. Wheatgrass is popular with many juice enthusiasts. Be careful with this, though, because the straw-like texture of wheatgrass clogs many conventional juicing machines. You can also juice shelled cashews, almonds, sunflower seeds, and many other seeds and nuts. When you juice nuts and seeds, it\u2019s important to soak them overnight to ensure you can extract as much from the meat as possible."

        {
          "headline":"Choose ripe, local produce that's in season.",
          "description":"Ripe fruits and vegetables will taste better and have more nutrients than unripe fruit, making your juice better tasting and be more nutritious. Also, seasonal local fruit will have less of an environmental impact than imported fruit. Local farmers markets are a great place to get fruits and vegetables for juicing. Many farms also have on-farm markets where you can buy or pick your own produce. Both conventional and organic produce may be grown with pesticides, so wash your fruits and vegetables well before juicing."
