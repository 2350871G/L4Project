For example, \"apart\" unstresses the \"a\" and stresses the \"part\", just like \"a\" in morse code (. -). \"Apart\" also starts with an \"a\", so it works very well. Use stressed syllables for dahs. An unstressed syllable would be the \"a\" sound in \"apart\", where \"part\" is the stressed syllable. A stressed syllable is a section of a word that has a longer duration, higher pitch, or a little louder than other syllables. Since dits are shorter than dahs, use dits as unstressed syllables and dahs as stressed syllables. Here is a list of syllabic mnemonic examples: a-PART for A (. -)\nBOOT to the head (- . . .)
