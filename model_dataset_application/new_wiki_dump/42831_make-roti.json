Some recipes just list \u201catta\u201d in the ingredients list; they are typically referring to chapati flour (indeed, the terms \u201croti\u201d and \u201cchapati\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably\u2014they are both unleavened wheat flatbreads). Atta/chapati flour is a finely ground whole wheat flour.It's the traditional choice for making roti. If you can't find chapati flour or don't have it on hand, you can substitute whole wheat flour. Because it is a heavier flour, though, you should consider using a mixture of half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour to more closely approximate the texture of chapati flour. You may even use only all-purpose flour in the recipe if that's all you have available. If you go this route, though, you may need to use less water. Be sure to pay attention to the consistency and texture of the dough as you mix; we'll explain more about this in the following steps. Additionally, if you use only all-purpose flour, your roti won't have as chewy and nutty of a flavor as traditional roti."

          "description":"You'll need to have a small amount of oil on hand to brush the finished rotis with, and optionally, a bit to add to the dough. You can use any cooking oil: olive oil, vegetable oil, melted butter or ghee, but ghee is recommended. Ghee is a clarified butter which has been simmered until all of the moisture has evaporated and the milk solids have begun to brown. Ghee has a nutty, carmel-like flavor and color. Ghee has a very high smoke point (almost 375\u00b0) and is thus well-suited for frying. It's readily available at Middle-Eastern and Indian markets and specialty food shops, or you can make your own ghee at home."

Be sure not to add the water too quickly; you don't want your dough to be too sticky or you won't be able to roll it out. If you are using a mixer or a food processor you may have to stop on occasion to scrape down the sides of the bowl before mixing/pulsing more. The finished dough should be soft and slightly sticky, though you should be able to peel it off your hand. If it sticks to your hands, it is too wet, and you should add a bit more flour."

This will help gluten proteins form. The amount of time you need to spend kneading the dough is flexible, and depends upon the strength of your kneading or your kitchen appliance. You are aiming at producing a pliable, stretchy dough that you'll be able to roll out. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/09\\/Make-Roti-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-Roti-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/09\\/Make-Roti-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\\/aid42831-v4-728px-Make-Roti-Step-6Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

Envision a clock when you roll: Roll up from six o' clock to twelve o' clock, then up from seven o' clock to one o' clock, etc. Be sure to flip the dough circle regularly so that the underside does not stick to the surface, and be sure to sprinkle more flour on the dough and the rolling surface as needed.
