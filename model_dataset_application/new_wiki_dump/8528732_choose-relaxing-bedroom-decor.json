          "description":"If you want a relaxing bedroom, it\u2019s important to use the right color palette in the decor. Cool shades are believed to have a calming effect, so they can create a more soothing atmosphere for your bedroom. Choose cool colors, such as blue, purple, green, and gray with cool undertones, for your bedroom decor. You can use both light and dark cool tones, depending on your preference. Dark cool shades can help make a large bedroom feel cozier, while light cool shades can help make a small bedroom appear larger. Neutral shades can also work when you\u2019re trying to create a relaxing bedroom. Consider incorporating shades of white, ivory, cream, beige, tan, taupe, brown, and/or black in the decor. Warm colors, such as red, yellow, and orange, are thought to be energizing, so they may be too stimulating for your bedroom decor. If you like those shades, use them in limited doses in the decor, such as a single throw pillow or rug. Avoid adding too many colors to the space or it may feel chaotic. Instead, stick with a few shades of a cool, neutral color."

          "headline":"Keep your decor simple.",
          "description":"When you\u2019re choosing decor for your bedroom, it\u2019s best to take a minimal approach. If you have too many accessories and pieces of artwork in the space, it can be distracting and keep you from getting a good night\u2019s sleep. Focus on just a few key pieces of decor to create an attractive but calm space. When you\u2019re keeping your decor to a minimum, it\u2019s especially important that you really love all of the items that you choose for your bedroom. Make sure that the furniture, artwork, plants, and other pieces in the space make you happy or help calm you down. Opt for simple decor with smooth, clean lines and avoid decor that's too ornate."

          "headline":"Consider adding a seating area.",
          "description":"The bed is obviously the most important piece of furniture in any bedroom, but you may want to create another area in the room where you can relax without sleeping. A seating area where you can read or just take a quiet moment for yourself can be a very important addition to your bedroom. In a small bedroom, a single cozy chair beside a window can serve as your seating area. In a large bedroom, you might add a couple of chairs or a loveseat to create a seating area."

          "description":"If you\u2019re choosing minimal decor for your bedroom, you should make a statement where you can. Instead of a plain headboard, opt for one that adds visual interest to the space. A dramatic, oversized style is a bold option, while a simple upholstered style can add color and/or pattern to your bedroom. If you\u2019re on a budget, you can create your own statement headboard. Repurpose an old door or pair of shutters, or mount foam tiles on the wall to create a headboard. You can also hang a tapestry or piece of fabric behind your bed instead of using a headboard."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose a plush comforter or bedspread.",
          "description":"To ensure that your bed is as comfortable as possible, opt for a plush comforter or bedspread. A down comforter is an ideal option because you can easily swap the duvet covers to change up the look of your bedroom when the mood strikes. A solid comforter or bedspread that matches the rest of the decor is a classic option, but your bedding is an ideal way to introduce a pattern to the room. Avoid comforters or bedspreads that have beading or other hard decorative elements. They usually aren\u2019t very comfortable to sleep with. For a calm and luxurious look, layer your bed with sheets, a comforter, and throw blankets."

          "headline":"Invest in high quality sheets.",
          "description":"While your comforter is a key piece of your bedroom decor, the sheets on your bed may be even more important when you want to create a relaxing space. Choose the best quality sheets that fit your budget to ensure that you\u2019re as comfortable as possible. Sheets made with natural fibers, such as cotton or linen, are the best option because they are breathable and hold up well. For the most comfortable sheets, make sure that they\u2019re over 200 thread count. In most cases, solid sheets that fit the color palette you\u2019ve chosen are the best option. However, if you opt for a solid comforter, you may want to use patterned sheets instead."

          "headline":"Incorporate decorative throw pillows.",
          "description":"In addition to the pillows that you sleep on at night, you\u2019ll want to add some decorative throw pillows to your bed. Not only can they add color, pattern, and texture to the decor, but they can help make your bed more comfortable. Just as with your comforter, avoid pillows that have beading, sequins, or other hard details that may be scratchy and uncomfortable."

Blackout shades are an ideal option, and are available in different styles that control how much light is filtered out. Opaque window coverings also allow you plenty of privacy in your bedroom. If you aren\u2019t a fan of blinds, opaque, floor-length drapes that are easy to open and close are an ideal alternative."

          "description":"Choosing a throw or area rug that\u2019s made from soft fabrics can help absorb sound and prevent echoing so your bedroom is more peaceful. Mohair and sheepskin work well to keep your bedroom quiet. Place your throw or area rug beneath or beside your bed to ensure that it blocks as much noise from reaching you while you\u2019re sleeping. For a bohemian look, layer several area rugs that all have complementing colors."

          "headline":"Incorporate ambient lighting.",
          "description":"If you share your bedroom with another person, there may be times when one of you is awake and the other is sleeping. To avoid disturbing one another, it\u2019s best to use lamps rather than overhead light fixtures. Place a lamp on each bedside table and in other areas of the room that you want to highlight. If your bedroom has overhead lights, consider adding dimmer switches. That will allow you to control how bright the light is, so it doesn\u2019t disturb you or your partner when you\u2019re trying to relax. You can also hang string lights on your headboard or above your window to create a calm environment."

In addition to candles or a fragrance oil diffuser, you may want to use a linen spray to add a calming scent to your sheets and bedding. Lavender is thought to be a very calming scent, so it\u2019s ideal for use in the bedroom. Other scents that can help create a peaceful mood include clary sage, ylang ylang, bergamot, and jasmine.

If you don't have the time to tend to real plants, get some fake plants instead."
