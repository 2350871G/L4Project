Don't try to clean the whole area in one go, instead work methodically through each section covered in crayon. As you wash the hair, gently scrape your finger along the crayon stained area, to remove the crayon with your fingers and nails. If you need more conditioner, add more to your fingers and run it over the hair. Keep scraping in this way until all of the color lifts off. The crayon should come off easily with the conditioner."
