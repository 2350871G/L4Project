          "description":"Although this is difficult to determine without first testing mattresses, a few physical factors can help direct your decision. If you have back problems, consider a medium-firm to firm mattress choice. These are best for supporting your lower back and reducing back pain. Pillow-top mattresses are best for people who aren\u2019t too light, as they won\u2019t have enough weight to suppress the top and the springs to a point that it makes a difference in comfort. Larger people typically find pillow-top mattresses more comfortable for this reason. Ignore the spring count that is given as proof for a mattress\u2019 supposed quality and firmness or softness. Studies have shown that the number of springs doesn\u2019t actually affect how comfortable the mattress is."

Check your space availability in your bedroom, and then decide on a size of mattress to fit. Twin mattresses are the smallest size, and measure on average 39\u201d/75\u201d. The next largest size after a twin mattress is a full or double mattress, which measures at 54\u201d/75\u201d. The queen sized mattress is the most commonly purchased by couples for its size and relative price. It measures at 60\u201d/80\u201d. King size bed is the largest standard sized mattress available. It is 76\u201d/80\u201d. Some mattress brands and stores offer an extra large bed called the California king, which measures at 72\u201d/84\u201d. Be sure the mattress size you intend to purchase not only fits inside your bedroom, but also through all doors used to enter the room."

Instead, just lay on the mattress to get a feel for how soft or firm it is. Try a firm, a plush, and a pillow-top mattress to get a feel for which type you prefer. Compare these types all within the same mattress brand to get the most accurate idea of which you like best.
