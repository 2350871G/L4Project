To be a top racer, you need to learn how to keep track of the GPS as well the road and your rivals. Keep your eyes on the road most of the time, but steal glances at the GPS when you are on a straight stretch of the road. You can also throw a glance at the GPS when you are moving at a considerably reduced speed, e.g., when returning into the action after crashing. Try to keep the parts of the GPS map that show the road in your immediate vicinity in memory. This will minimize the number of times you have to take your eyes off the road."

Immediately after the race kicks off, check your GPS map for any sharp bends you might have to immediately negotiate. Form a strategy on how to tackle the bend without sacrificing too much speed before you get there. In NFS Hot Pursuit (2010) PC, for example, the best way is to drift around the bend. When you reach the mouth of the bend, tap the brakes (use the Down arrow key), and get straight back on the gas (Up arrow key) while steering the car in the direction of the bend (Left/Right arrow key). The brake button should be held for longer if the bend is long in order to drift for longer. You can also opt to reduce your speed so you take the bend nicely or momentarily let go of the gas as you take it."
