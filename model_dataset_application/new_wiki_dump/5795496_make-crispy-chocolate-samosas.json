  "text":" Making the chocolate filling Chop the bars of chocolate, nuts and dried fruits into very small pieces. They should still be solid, so don't chop them so fine that they're powdery. Mix the chopped chocolate with the nuts and dried fruits. Add the dark chocolate powder to the mixture. Add cream to this mixture and mix it thoroughly with a spoon. Mix well until it takes on the consistency of a paste. If it does not turn into a paste, add some more cream. Heat this mixture at a low temperature. As it heats, stir it slowly and thoroughly. Keep stirring until all of the chocolate present in the mixture melts. After making this thick chocolate paste, turn off the heating. Making the chocolate samosas Tip 2 cups of all-purpose/plain/maida flour into a mixing bowl. Add some oil to it, and add a pinch of cumin. Mix together, then knead for a few minutes to form a dough. Ensure that the dough is not sticky. Set it aside for a half an hour to improve in texture. Divide the dough into equal portions of around six to eight pieces. Roll out each piece into a thin circular shape. Cut each round in half, to form semi-circles. Add the chocolate filling into the center of each dough semi-circle (about 1 to 2 teaspoons). Bring the edges together to form a cone shape, then seal the edges carefully using a little water. (You can also make paste using flour and water for easier sealing). Use your fingers to press the edges of each samosa into place. Frying the chocolate samosas Pour some oil in deep-mouthed frying pan. Heat the oil. Gently lower the chocolate-filled samosas into the hot oil it, using a slotted spoon or similar to hold them with. Fry until they turn slightly golden in colour. Don't add too many at once; if overcrowded, the samosas may fall apart and not cook properly. Remove from the hot oil. Using the slotted spoon, carefully remove the golden samosas from the hot oil. After each batch is finished frying, use a slotted spoon to move the finished samosas to a plate lined with paper towels to drain off the extra oil. Take care not to let them fry for too long, or the dough will become tough. Serve. If you want, you can garnish the samosas with chocolate syrup and chopped nuts when on the serving plate. Your crispy chocolate samosas are ready to be served, either to your friends, relatives, or siblings.",
