          "description":"Classic nachos highlight the two most essential nachos ingredients: chips and cheese. Build on this foundation by adding whatever toppings you desire. Pick up the following items:\nTortilla Chips: flour or corn, the fresher the better. The perfect chip is thick enough to hold serious toppings but light enough to let the other ingredients shine. Cheese: cheddar is the classic, but mozzarella, monterey jack, cotija; if it can shred, it\u2019ll taste good. Mix them for color. Salsa: your choice. The classic is chunky pico de gallo. Sour cream: Try not to choose low fat. Sour cream gives Nachos part of their umami and balances the spice. Pickled jalape\u00f1os: available in most supermarkets. Leave these out if you can\u2019t handle the spice. Beans: black beans or refried beans are the most popular choices. This optional ingredient adds some heft to your nachos. Meat: seasoned ground beef or shredded chicken. Adding some well-cooked and seasoned meat, while optional, can make your nachos much more satisfying."
