Reminding yourself of your reason for stopping will help you be able to resist cravings for fast food when they hit. Write your reason or reasons for stopping on a sticky note and place it somewhere you'll see it when you feel tempted to eat fast food (e.g., in your car) to maximize its effectiveness."

          "description":"If there are certain fast foods, such as burgers, fries, or milkshakes, that cause you to crave fast food, it's important that you limit your exposure to them. The less you expose yourself to your trigger foods, the less you'll be tempted to eat fast food. You may want to institute a complete ban on your trigger foods, at least until you feel like you've gotten your fast food habit under control. If you're out with others who want to eat your trigger foods, be willing to tell them that that would make you feel uncomfortable. They will probably understand and be willing to eat something else to accommodate you."

To avoid putting yourself in this position, make a meal plan and prepare all of your meals for the coming week ahead of time. Do as much of the prep work for your meals as you can. If the meals include multi-step preparations, such as marinating meat before cooking it, do these preparations at the start of the week and freeze or refrigerate the ingredients until it's time to cook. Bring healthy snacks you can eat at school or work during your meal breaks to avoid falling back on fast food when you're hungry. If the snacks are non-perishable, leave some in your office for future use."

          "description":"Fast food is unfortunately very appealing as a comfort food during times of great stress. Thus, you can greatly reduce the temptation to eat fast food by avoiding stress or by dealing with stress in more healthy ways. Some healthy ways of dealing with stress include doing yoga, meditating, or speaking to a therapist. If you're stressed out about work or some other task, remind yourself before doing anything else that eating fast food won't reduce the amount of work you need to do. In stressful situations, reach out to other people for help or camaraderie before turning to fast food. Talking with other people is a great way to alleviate stress in a healthy way."

Aim for around 8 hours of restful sleep each night to stay energized and avoid craving fast food. Try to go to bed at a reasonable hour every night. This will not only help you to get enough sleep each night but will also help prevent late-night cravings for fast food."

Instead of using fast food to deal with these issues, find healthy alternatives you can use to grapple with your negative emotions. Good examples of healthy means of dealing with your emotions include journaling, exercising, or expressing yourself creatively. If you're experiencing serious emotional issues, you may need to seek professional help to treat them."

There are a lot of cookbooks and websites dedicated to healthy cooking, such as EatingWell and Whole Heartedly Healthy, that you can use to find new recipes to try out in the kitchen.

Fruits and vegetables, meanwhile, are chock full of the nutrients your body needs every day. Eating fruits like apples and bananas will also help to satisfy your sweet tooth if you ever crave fast food desserts. Consider carrying around nuts in a plastic jar or small baggie wherever you go so you can have them with you at all times."

Men should drink roughly 3.7 litres (130  fl oz) of water per day and women should drink 2.7 litres (91  fl oz) per day. Replacing soda with water will also limit your sugar intake and reduce your cravings for sugary foods like fast food desserts. You should avoid diet sodas as well, if possible. Although they don't contain sugar, evidence suggests they can still reinforce an addiction to sugar. Carry a refillable water bottle with you wherever you go to be able to drink water no matter where you are."

Opt for salads and grilled foods instead of fried and breaded items to minimize the impact of fast food on your health. If you choose salad, be wary of putting a lot of dressing or cheese on it, as these can add a lot of hidden calories and sugar to your otherwise healthy meal. If you don't see any healthy options on the menu, don't be afraid to ask for healthier options or substitutions. Restaurant staff may be willing to accommodate you if you ask nicely."
