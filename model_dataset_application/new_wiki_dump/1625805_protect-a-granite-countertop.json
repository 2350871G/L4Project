Because of the granite's weight, your lower cabinets need to be of sturdy construction and affixed properly to the wall. Otherwise, the cabinets may partially collapse, leaving the granite to crack as it falls. A licensed contractor can make the assessment of your cabinets' strength if you are unsure."
