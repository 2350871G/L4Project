          "description":"Because it\u2019s the most intense hue, red really raises a room\u2019s energy level. Red is thought to speed up respiration and heart rate in addition to increasing blood pressure. This may be a good color for a dining room or living room accent wall because it enhances appetite, draws people together, and stimulates conversation. Paint your entryway red to make a strong first impression. Avoid using shades of red in bedrooms, because the powerful color can excite too much to have in areas where people regularly sleep.

Contrary to red shades, blue shades slow down heart rate and respiration, and also lower blood pressure. Consider painting a blue accent wall in a bedroom or bathroom. There are tons of different shades of blue available and it\u2019s a very versatile color that can be used with almost any style."

          "description":"This color, best used on a wall in a bathroom, kitchen, or dining room, communicates happiness and provides energy. If you choose to paint all the walls in a room yellow, opt for a mellow or muted color as a harsh, saturated shade is hard on your eyesight and may even cause headaches. A yellow accent wall in a crowded space can be especially helpful in providing the illusion of expansiveness and openness. Too much yellow can be a bad thing. In large amounts, yellow is thought to quicken tempers and make babies cry more."

This color can work well in just about any room where you wish to encourage comfort and winding down. Consider having a green accent wall in your home office, because this color is best for concentration."

Consider painting an orange accent wall in your exercise room because it may boost your energy a bit while also making you feel positive about your workout. You might want to use orange in an office or study because it helps increase creativity. Living rooms and dining rooms are also good places to have an orange accent wall."

You can either paint a unique pattern or you can have your accent wall be made of a different material entirely. Create a modern design on a wall using painter\u2019s tape or a stencil, then paint over it in a color that contrasts the existing wall color. Once the paint dries, remove the tape or stencil to reveal the wall color underneath. Use Venetian plaster to create a textured wall in eggplant purple to create some artistic pizzazz. If your style is more rustic, try a wood-paneled accent wall. Go for a stone accent wall to create a rich, sophisticated atmosphere in your home."

If a room feels too big or awkwardly long, you may want your accent color to be warmer, while a smaller room benefits from a cooler accent color. Using a dark color in a small room creates a cozy, intimate feel, while a lighter color opens up the space and makes it feel larger."

Pick a wall that an important piece of furniture sits in front of, such as a bed in a bedroom, or a large couch in a living room. This compliments an already attractive part of the room. Paint the wall a color that contrasts the furniture in front of it to highlight both the wall and the furniture. For instance, choose a light color for a wall that a dark-colored sofa sits against.
