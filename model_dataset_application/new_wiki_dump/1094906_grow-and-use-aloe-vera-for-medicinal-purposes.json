Since aloe vera plants are native to dry, hot regions, they can survive droughts, but the plants will be more likely to thrive if watered every few days. Water your aloe vera plants less in the winter, since the plants will drain more slowly. Over watering can cause rot to form, which may kill your plant."

You will have to completely remove your aloe plant from its pot to find these baby plants. Use sharp scissors or a knife to sever them from the mother plant. Repot the mother plant when you are finished and transfer each of the baby plants to their own pot."
