Cleanse it from any existing rust through a shot blasting process or immersing the affected parts in an alkali/acid bath. Once this is done, your pieces will have to be immersed in a molten zinc bath of approximately 450 \u00b0C (842 \u00b0F). Finally, it will be coated with a passive Chromate coat."
