          "description":"If your house has a bed in which you slept at least once without sleeping in any other beds since then, the easiest way for you to get back to your house is by jumping off a cliff in order to die and respawn at the house. You will have to enable Survival Mode temporarily if you're currently playing in Creative Mode. This absolutely will not work if you haven't yet slept in a bed, or if the last bed you slept in wasn't the bed in your house. If you're carrying valuable resources which you don't want to lose upon death, you can build a chest to store them and then check your coordinates by pressing F3 (desktop) or by consulting a map (console and pocket/PE editions). Upon respawning, you can travel back to the coordinates to claim your items. If you're using Java Edition and your world is set to Hardcore Mode, you can't kill your character, otherwise, you'd have to delete your world."
