          "description":"Lighting is one of the most effective ways to create a pleasant atmosphere in a space. Position a lamp on one side of the table to create a striking look, or place lamps on either side of the table to make a symmetrical look. Choose light bulbs that have yellow tones instead of blue tones to create a warmer atmosphere. Choose lamps that fit with your personal style and match the colors in the rest of your room. Make sure the lamps are proportional to the size of your sofa table so they look good together."

          "headline":"Purchase boxes or dishes to store remotes.",
          "description":"Most homes have at least a few remotes, and you can keep them all in one handy place on your sofa table. If you have lots of remotes, a box is a good way to keep them all in one place. If you only have 1 or 2 remotes, a shallow dish is an aesthetically pleasing way to store the remotes. If you have lots of remotes that you don\u2019t use often, store them in the drawer if your sofa table has one or somewhere out of sight. Only place the remotes you use most days on the sofa table. Keeping the sofa table uncluttered will make it look much more elegant."

          "headline":"Include candles or diffusers to add decoration and scent.",
          "description":"Add nice smells to your living room to make the area feel inviting and luxurious. Choose a decorative candle that fits the color scheme of your lounge and has a pleasant scent. Use multiple candles to create a trendy look, but be cautious of combining too many scents as this can become overwhelming. If you have small children or rowdy pets, candles on sofa tables are best for decorative purposes rather than for functionality. Sofa tables often get bumped making them an unsafe place for open flames, so stick to battery-operated candles instead. Purchase candles and diffusers from homeware stores. Potpourri makes great decoration as well as making your home smell great!"

          "headline":"Add a plant to the table if you want to create a fresh atmosphere.",
          "description":"Plants help to improve the air quality in a room and can heighten people's sense of wellbeing. If you want your plants to be a focal point of the table, choose a large plant with thick leaves. If you want the plants to be a small feature, choose a delicate plant with small, thin leaves. A rubber fig is a beautiful indoor plant with thick leaves. If you want a more delicate option, the maidenhair fern is a lovely option. If you struggle to keep plants alive, consider choosing an artificial plant or a cactus. Choose a flowering pot plant if you want to add color to the table. Check to see if the plants are poisonous to pets before putting them in your home."

Stack the books so that the table doesn\u2019t look cluttered. Place a book with a nice cover on the top of the stack. Choose books that are similar in size so that the stack doesn\u2019t fall over. If you don\u2019t like reading, consider having a few interesting coffee table books on the table for guests to browse through."

However, a few meaningful items will make the table feel more personal and less stark. Choose a few ornaments that are meaningful to you and match the colors in your living room. If there is a stack of books on your table, consider placing a small ornament on top of the stack. This will add multiple layers to the space. A pinecone, a small figurine, or a small clock are all good options. Switch out the ornaments each season to keep your decor looking fresh."

          "description":"If your sofa table and couch are in the middle of the room, a good way to maximize the utility of the table is to add seating. This enables the table to be used as a dining table as well as allows you to pull out extra chairs when you have guests. Choose chairs that aren\u2019t too chunky so that they don\u2019t distract from the table. Place the chairs behind the table rather than at the side of the table. If you think that chairs will make the room look too cluttered, consider purchasing ottomans instead. These can be pushed under the table when they aren\u2019t be used. Generally, 2 or 3 chairs will fit comfortably under most sofa tables. Add decorative baskets or store extra items under the table if it has a bottom shelf."

If you have low ceilings, keep the decorations on the table fairly low. If the ceilings are high, pick taller objects to display on the table. Consider stacking objects to create height.

Interesting books and items that you purchased when traveling are good options. The focal point is a good way to integrate color into the table, especially if the rest of the decorations are neutral colors. Choose an item that complements the color of the walls and couches. Don\u2019t be afraid to pick a bold or bright color."
