However, if the shrub is rather large and growing vigorously, it should be trimmed during the summer. Pruning at this time suppresses aggressive growth. Pruning from late summer through fall should be avoided. Shrubs pruned at this time will put on new, lush growth that is either lost in the fall or damaged during the winter. Blooming season and whether the shrub blooms on old wood or new wood should also be taken into consideration. For example, border forsythias (Forsythia x intermedia) bloom on \u201cold wood\u201d or stems that form during the previous year. They should be pruned immediately after they finish flowering, usually in mid-spring, so that they will have time to form new flower buds for the following year.
