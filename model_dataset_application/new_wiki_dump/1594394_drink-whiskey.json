          "headline":"Pour your whiskey into a glass.",
          "description":"Select a small glass tumbler, such as a lowball glass. To really get the most out of the scent and flavor of the whiskey, use a tulip-shaped whiskey glass. Try to avoid using a plastic or polystyrene cup as you might find that materials other than glass impart their own flavor to the whiskey. For a really old-fashioned experience (and if you don\u2019t mind a little metallic flavor), try drinking your whiskey from a tin cup. A little whiskey goes a long way. Start by pouring yourself 1 finger (about 30-50 mL): wrap your index finger around the bottom of the glass and pour up to the height of the top edge of your index finger."

          "headline":"Try the whiskey neat before adding water or ice.",
          "description":"Before you add anything else to the whiskey, at least sample a little of it in its pure state. This will not only give you a better idea of the whiskey\u2019s flavor and aroma, but will also help you decide whether or not you really want to mix it with anything. If you enjoy the taste of alcohol, you may prefer drinking your whiskey neat."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Smell the whiskey 2 or 3 times before tasting it.",
          "description":"Put your nose in the glass and take a deep huff. You may need to do this a few times to really get a sense of the aroma, since the smell of alcohol may be overpowering on the first sniff. Then you may start to notice other notes, like spices and wood. Tip: Using a tulip-shaped whiskey glass can enhance the smell of the whiskey since the narrow opening helps trap and concentrate the vapors at the top of the glass. Keep your mouth open while you smell the whiskey to enhance both your sense of smell and sense of taste, which will allow you to understand the whiskey better."

          "headline":"Roll the whiskey around in your mouth before swallowing.",
          "description":"Don\u2019t just gulp the whiskey down. Take a small sip and move it around on your tongue. After you swallow, wait for a moment before taking another sip so that you can appreciate the aftertaste. You may notice flavors such as caramel, toffee, or vanilla. Some people like to \u201cchew\u201d their whiskey before swallowing it, making sure that it coats the entire tongue and inside of the mouth. Breathing through your nose as you swallow the whiskey can also help you experience the aroma more fully. If you don\u2019t like the taste of the whiskey on your first sip, don\u2019t give up on it right away. The first sip may taste overwhelmingly like alcohol, but you will probably begin to notice other flavors on your second or third taste. It's an acquired taste, so it takes time to truly appreciate the complex flavors and aromas of whiskey."

        {
          "headline":"Add a splash of water to enhance the flavor.",
          "description":"Add a few drops of fresh, clean water to your whiskey and give it a quick stir with a straw. Doing this will dull the harshness of the alcohol and bring out the other, more subtle flavors of the whiskey. Experiment with adding water little-by-little until you achieve the flavor you\u2019re looking for. Note: It\u2019s not clear why water makes whiskey taste better, but some scientists think the water traps chemicals that cause unpleasant flavors, or that it drives the tastier components to the surface."

          "description":"Put a large ice cube or an ice ball in your whiskey if you\u2019d like it extra cold. While some whiskey aficionados turn up their noses at the idea of drinking whiskey on the rocks, there\u2019s nothing wrong with adding a little ice if you like. It's your drink, so make it how you like! Do keep in mind that the ice will dilute the whiskey as it melts. The coldness of the ice can also numb your taste buds a bit, making it harder to pick up on the subtler flavors. Larger pieces of ice will melt more slowly than small ones, so they won\u2019t dilute the drink as quickly. Alternatively, you can use chilled whiskey stones, which are soapstone chunks that chill the whiskey without diluting it."

          "headline":"Take your time finishing your drink.",
          "description":"Since part of the appeal of whiskey is its flavor, you\u2019ll probably get the most out of it if you sip it slowly instead of slamming it back like a shot. Give yourself 30 to 60 minutes to slowly finish your whiskey. If you like shooting whiskey, that\u2019s fine, too! Experiment with savoring your whiskey slowly or knocking it back in one gulp, and see which you prefer."

These scotches are both at the lower end of the alcohol content range, at approximately 40% by volume (or 80 proof), and bottles cost around $30-$40 USD.

The 2 oldest and most famous distilleries currently in business in the region are Auchentoshan and Glenkinchie. Like most scotches, Lowlands whiskeys are single malts, meaning that they are made with malted barley from a single distillery.

These are good choices if you don\u2019t like sweet or floral drinks, but they may be overwhelming for a first-time whiskey drinker. Islay scotches are known for their strong flavors, which come from the peat fuel that is used during the malting process. Some of the most famous Islay scotches distilleries are Lagavulin, Ardbeg, and Laphroaig. For a somewhat lighter flavor, try a Bruichladdich scotch. Islands scotches are also peaty, but are milder and sweeter than Islay scotches. Try a Tobermory or Highland Park, or choose an Arran bottle for a lighter and fruitier taste.

The wheat imparts a softer, gentler flavor to the bourbon, which can make it more palatable than some other bourbons to someone who isn\u2019t used to whiskey.

As the name suggests, these bourbons are bottled from the products of a single barrel instead of a blend of different barrels. The flavors of these whiskeys are affected by factors such as how long they were aged, the wood from which the barrel was made, and conditions in the warehouse where they were stored. A few popular single barrel options include Elijah Craig 18-Year-Old, Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit, and Eagle Rare. Flavors range from woody and smoky to smooth and spicy-sweet. While these bourbons can be quite pricey, \u201csingle-barrel\u201d does not always equate to prohibitively expensive. You can get a bottle of Eagle Rare 10 Year Old for around $20 USD."

Because of their gentler flavor, these are a good starting point if you\u2019re new to drinking whiskey. Note: Irish whiskeys usually contain a mixture of malted and unmalted barley and are traditionally distilled in a copper pot. \u201cPot still\u201d whiskeys are said to be particularly full-bodied and rich. Irish whiskeys are typically aged in the barrel for at least 3 years, helping them achieve their characteristic smooth finish. Jameson and Bushmills White Label are 2 of the most popular Irish whiskeys. Whiskey connoisseurs also recommend Greenspot, Redbreast 12 Year Old, or Clontarf."

You may find that many blended whiskeys taste smoother than whiskeys made from a single distillation. In addition to containing blends of grain, Canadian whiskeys can also be made with other ingredients, such as wine or any 2-year-old spirit. Because of the wide variety of blends and distillation techniques available in Canada, Canadian whiskeys come in a huge range of flavors. For example, you might try a JP Wiser\u2019s 18 Year Old if you want a smoky, earthy flavor. If you prefer something fruity, sweet, and soft, Corby\u2019s Pike Creek is a good bet."

Rye tends to be more peppery and savory than many whiskeys, so you may want to grab a bottle of rye if you aren\u2019t a fan of sweeter spirits.

          "description":"If you don\u2019t like a strong alcohol burn, look for whiskeys that have had more time to mature. As whiskey ages, the wood from the barrel softens the harshness of the drink. As the wood draws out some of the harsher flavors from the whiskey, it also adds its own distinct flavors to the mix. Note: Unlike wine, whiskey\u2019s flavor does not improve if it sits for a while in a bottle. The important part of the aging process takes place in the barrel, before the whiskey is bottled. Older is not always better. Whiskey that\u2019s been aged too long (e.g., 23 versus 15 years) can sometimes soak up too many tannins from the wood, resulting in an unpleasant flavor."

Choose Talisker for a smoky and peaty taste. Campbeltown scotches are complex and slightly salty, with peaty notes similar to those found in Islay's. The major distilleries are Glen Scotia, Longrow, and Springbank. Choosing a Bourbon Start with a wheated bourbon for a softer taste.

As the name suggests, these bourbons are bottled from the products of a single barrel instead of a blend of different barrels. The flavors of these whiskeys are affected by factors such as how long they were aged, the wood from which the barrel was made, and conditions in the warehouse where they were stored. A few popular single barrel options include Elijah Craig 18-Year-Old, Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit, and Eagle Rare. Flavors range from woody and smoky to smooth and spicy-sweet. While these bourbons can be quite pricey, \u201csingle-barrel\u201d does not always equate to prohibitively expensive. You can get a bottle of Eagle Rare 10 Year Old for around $20 USD. Picking Other Whiskey Varieties Choose Irish whiskey if you prefer a light body. Irish whiskeys tend to be fruitier and lighter than their American and Scottish cousins, with a less pronounced alcohol burn. Because of their gentler flavor, these are a good starting point if you\u2019re new to drinking whiskey. Note: Irish whiskeys usually contain a mixture of malted and unmalted barley and are traditionally distilled in a copper pot. \u201cPot still\u201d whiskeys are said to be particularly full-bodied and rich. Irish whiskeys are typically aged in the barrel for at least 3 years, helping them achieve their characteristic smooth finish. Jameson and Bushmills White Label are 2 of the most popular Irish whiskeys. Whiskey connoisseurs also recommend Greenspot, Redbreast 12 Year Old, or Clontarf. Pick a Canadian whiskey if you want a unique blend. Canadian whiskeys are typically blends, meaning they contain a mixture of grain and malt whiskeys. You may find that many blended whiskeys taste smoother than whiskeys made from a single distillation. In addition to containing blends of grain, Canadian whiskeys can also be made with other ingredients, such as wine or any 2-year-old spirit. Because of the wide variety of blends and distillation techniques available in Canada, Canadian whiskeys come in a huge range of flavors. For example, you might try a JP Wiser\u2019s 18 Year Old if you want a smoky, earthy flavor. If you prefer something fruity, sweet, and soft, Corby\u2019s Pike Creek is a good bet. Try rye whiskey for a bold and spicy flavor. Like bourbon, rye whiskey is an American spirit aged in barrels made from American oak. In order to qualify as a rye, a whiskey must be made with at least 51% rye grain. Rye tends to be more peppery and savory than many whiskeys, so you may want to grab a bottle of rye if you aren\u2019t a fan of sweeter spirits. Popular rye brands include Old Overholt, Wild Turkey, and Bulleit. Get whiskey that\u2019s been aged longer for a smooth finish. If you don\u2019t like a strong alcohol burn, look for whiskeys that have had more time to mature. As whiskey ages, the wood from the barrel softens the harshness of the drink. As the wood draws out some of the harsher flavors from the whiskey, it also adds its own distinct flavors to the mix. Note: Unlike wine, whiskey\u2019s flavor does not improve if it sits for a while in a bottle. The important part of the aging process takes place in the barrel, before the whiskey is bottled. Older is not always better. Whiskey that\u2019s been aged too long (e.g., 23 versus 15 years) can sometimes soak up too many tannins from the wood, resulting in an unpleasant flavor. Try a variety of whiskeys in each style. Even within a single type of whiskey, you will encounter a lot of variation. For example, don\u2019t just try one kind of Irish whiskey and decide it\u2019s not for you\u2014you might prefer another bottle that was aged a little longer or has a higher or lower alcohol content. If you can, compare cheaper varieties with more expensive ones. You may find that the pricier bottles are not necessarily your favorites!",
