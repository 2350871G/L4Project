Drill holes in the plastic along the guide lines so your blade has places to start and stop easily. Make straight relief cuts from the outside of the plastic to the curves.

A pull saw helps make a cleaner, smoother line in your plastic and may be easier for making shorter straight cuts than an electric saw. Use your thumb to guide the blade when you make the initial cut. From there, place the saw into the line you\u2019ve made and pull the saw through."
