Some collectors prefer these new, \"mint condition\" stamps due to the higher quality, while others enjoy reading the cancellation ink mark the post office puts over stamps used in the mail. You can specialize in one type or the other if you like, but it's fine to keep both types in your collection."

You can trade these stamps with other collectors for their own duplicates, expanding your collection. If you do not have any friends or coworkers who collect stamps, ask employees and customers at the local hobby shop or stamp dealer if they're interested in trading. At the early stage of the hobby, it is best to trade one stamp for one stamp, instead of trying to learn the market value. One exception is stamps that are torn, damaged, or covered by a heavy cancellation (post office ink), which is typically worth less than a stamp in good condition."

These are often called tweezers because they so resemble them, but are weaker and smoother to avoid damaging the stamp. Thin, rounded tips make it easy to slide underneath a stamp, while sharp points should be avoided due to the possibility of tears."

If you like collecting the cancellation marks, or the post office ink mark over the stamp, cut out a rectangle of paper around the mark and skip ahead to the storage step in this section. Otherwise, cut a small square around the stamp itself. You don't have to be precise, since the steps below will remove the remaining scrap of paper. Because the cancellation mark takes up a lot of space in your collection, most collectors only save the most interesting ones."

          "description":"This traditional method works on U.S. stamps from before 2004, and most stamps from other countries. Put the paper-backed stamps in a bowl of lukewarm water, with the stamp face up. Use enough room for each one to float to the surface. After 15\u201320 minutes, once the stamps have begun to separate from the paper, use your stamp tongs to transfer the stamps to a dry paper towel. Handling the wet stamp very gently, scrape off the remaining paper. If the paper does not come off, let the stamp soak longer. Do not try to peel off the stamp. Stamps on brightly colored paper or with purple ink marks should be soaked in separate bowls, since the ink on the paper might bleed and dye the stamps."

          "headline":"Rinse and dry the stamps.",
          "description":"Once the paper is removed, rinse the back of the stamp in fresh water to remove the last of the gummy residue. Let the stamps dry overnight on a paper towel. If the stamps curl, you can place them between paper towels and sandwich them in between heavy books."

          "headline":"Remove self-adhesive stamps with air freshener.",
          "description":"Self-adhesive stamps, including all U.S. stamps since 2004, cannot be removed from paper using the traditional warm water method. Instead, find a non-aerosol, 100% natural, citrus-based air freshener, such as Pure Citrus or ZEP. Spray a small amount onto the paper attached to stamps, so the paper is soaked and translucent. Turn the stamp face up, roll the paper corner slightly, and slowly peel off the stamp. To remove the sticky back, dip your finger in talcum powder and wipe the back of stamp lightly."

Choose between these two options:\n\"Hinges\" are small, folded pieces of paper or plastic. To use one, moisten the short end, stick it to the stamp back, then moisten the long end and attach to the stamp album. These are not recommended for valuable stamps. \"Mounts\" are plastic sleeves, which are more expensive but better for your stamps.
