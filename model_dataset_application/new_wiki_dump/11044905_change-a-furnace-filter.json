Tip: Check your filter every month to see if it needs replacement. Most disposable types of filters are designed to be replaced every 1-2 months. If you have furry pets or your furnace runs all the time, then your filter will get dirty more quickly. If the furnace turns on while there is not filter in it, then it can suck up potentially-damaging loose debris.

These types of filters are antimicrobial and specially designed to trap things like mold, mildew, fungus, yeast, and algae. They are available in both disposable and reusable varieties. The cheapest disposable furnace filters are fiberglass with cardboard frames. This kind of filter will trap large particles of dust and is designed to be replaced every 1-2 months. If you want to upgrade your filter, you can get a slightly more expensive disposable pleated filter, which will trap smaller particles of dust , pollen, and dirt. These filters last longer; from 4 months to 1 year."
