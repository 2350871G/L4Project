Cushions can take a lot of physical abuse, so making a cushion out of delicate fabric might look good at first but it will not last very long. The amount of fabric you buy will depend on the size cushion you are making. Measure your cushion insert (or decide on a size of insert if you do not have one already). You will need 2 1/2 times the length of the cushion insert, as the fabric will be covering both sides of the cushion with a little overlap. Your fabric should also be a few inches wider than the width of the cushion insert, as you will need a bit extra for seam allowance."

The length of your fabric should measure 2 1/2 times the length of the cushion insert. The width of your fabric should measure the width of your cushion plus two inches. The extra two inches will give you enough extra fabric for seam allowance and the fluff of your insert. If your insert is very fluffy you may need to add a few more inches to the width. If you are unsure of what width you should cut, put your insert on top of the fabric. Make sure the width of the fabric will fit up to the center of the sides of the insert plus a few inches for seam allowance. Your piece of fabric should end up being shaped like a long rectangle, with two long edges and two short edges."
