If you know the size of the boards you\u2019ll be using, you can use the provided dimensions instead of measuring the boards. For example, a 4 x 4 has a thickness of 4 inches and a width of 4 inches.

          "description":"Start by taking all 3 measurements and multiplying them together. For this example, 4 x 4 x 10 = 160. To finish the calculation, just divide by 12. In this case, 160 \u00f7 12 = 13.33, so you need 13.33 board feet of lumber.Variation: If you measured the length in inches rather than feet, such as if you have a very short board, multiply the dimensions of the board together as usual but divide the result by 144 instead of 12. If you have multiple boards that are the same size, do the entire calculation for a single board and multiply it by the number of boards you need. For instance, if you have 20 boards that are 2 inches by 6 inches by 8 feet, multiply 2 by 6 by 8, which equals 96. Divide 96 by 12, which is 8 (the number of board feet in a single board of this size). Multiply 8 by 20, which is 160, to find the total board feet."

Remember that volume is a three-dimensional measurement while square footage is a two-dimensional measurement. Take the total board feet and divide it by the thickness, in inches, of the boards. For example, say you have 1,500 board feet of lumber. If the boards are 3 inches thick, divide 1,500 by 3, which is equal to 500. So, 1,500 board feet is equivalent to 500 square feet."
