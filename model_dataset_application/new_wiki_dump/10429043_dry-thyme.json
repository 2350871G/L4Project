You\u2019re looking for sprigs that are strong and will stay together as they dry. You can trim most of the new growth off of a plant as long as you keep the woody growth intact.

Making sure that the thyme no longer was water on it will minimize the chance of it getting moldy as it dries."

          "description":"Hold your bundle in your less dominant hand and have a piece of string or twine that is about 12 inches (30 cm) long in the other hand. Start wrapping the string around the bundle, leaving a few inches loose before the start of the wraps. Once the bundle is secure and you have a few inches of string left at the end, tie the end to the piece you left loose at the beginning. You can tie the ends together with a bow or a knot but just make sure that it is tight and secure."

          "headline":"Hang the bundle in a warm, dark place.",
          "description":"Loop the string on a nail or a hook in a spot that will let the bundle hang freely. You want free airflow around the bundle and you want it to be out of direct sunlight, which could dry the thyme too quickly. The temperature around the thyme should be at least 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). This temperature will ensure that the thyme dries at a steady rate. It\u2019s best to have the thyme in a spot with low humidity, so that mold doesn\u2019t develop on it. Check the thyme for mold after the first few days of drying. Throw it out if you see any on the sprigs. However, after the first few days the risk of mold developing is minimal because the plant will have lost most of its moisture. You can hang your thyme to dry in any dark corner of your kitchen, living room, or dining room, as long as it has good air flow and a warm temperature."

          "description":"Once the thyme looks and feels dry, you can take the bundle down and process it. Place the bundle on a clean sheet pan or a piece of wax paper and open it up. Start removing the leaves by plucking them off the stems with your fingers. They should come off relatively easily once the thyme is dry. The amount of time it will take for your thyme to dry will vary depending on the variety of your thyme and the conditions you are growing it in. However, it usually takes 1 or 2 weeks for thyme to dry out completely. An easy way to do this is to hold the stem in one hand and run your fingers down the stem with your other hand."

          "headline":"Store the thyme in an air-tight container in a dark place.",
          "description":"Keeping it in an air-tight container and keeping it out of sunlight can keep it fresh and tasty for several years after drying. Many people put it in spice jars but you can also simply put it in an air-tight plastic bag or mason jar with a lid. Put the container in a dark, dry location, such as a cupboard or pantry. The thyme will basically never go \"bad\" but it will lose its flavor potency over time. After a year or so you should assess the flavor your dried thyme has and decide if you need to dry some more."
