If there is still dry besan after the next step, or if you like extra-shiny, soft ladoos, add more one spoonful at a time. Ghee is clarified butter that's been toasted for a nutty, caramelized flavor. You can substitute plain unsalted butter, but it will have much less flavor."

Too little cooking will leave an unpleasant raw taste, while too much can burn the flour. Constant stirring will help prevent these problems. Use an Indian karahi (kadai), a wok, or a deep saucepan. Besan is the Hindi word for gram flour. It is also sold as chickpea flour, garbanzo bean flour, cece flour, chana flour, or (in Tamil markets) kadalai maavu."

Milk adds a richer taste and fluffier texture, but shortens the shelf life. You can skip the milk if you like. When you drizzle milk over the besan ghee mix, it should sizzle and disappear into the besan."

This will stop the sugar from melting, but not cool it so much that the sugar can't blend in. While waiting, you can make boora if you want to use it instead of sugar."

If you only have granulated sugar, turn it into powdered sugar with a food processor, coffee grinder, or spice grinder."

If it is too dry to form balls, mix in another teaspoon (5 mL) of ghee and try again. Keep adding ghee until the balls stick together. They will also be easier to form if you put the mix in the fridge for 20\u201330 minutes."

Here's a larger batch so you can store extra for other recipes:\nMix 2\u00bc cup (450g) granulated sugar and \u00bd cup (120 mL) water. Heat in a karahi or other deep pan. Bring to a boil. Stir constantly for 2 or 3 minutes. Add a spoonful of milk and stir. Use a ladle to skim off the dirty foam that appears at the top. (May not be necessary if sugar and water is clean.) When you drizzle milk over the besan ghee mix, it should sizzle and disappear into the besan. Add a spoonful of ghee to prevent lumps. Cook until the syrup is very thick and nearly transparent. Keep stirring vigorously. This takes about ten minutes. Turn the heat off. Move it to a cool surface. Keep stirring constantly until the mixture cools."
