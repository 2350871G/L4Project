  "text":" Mix the base yeast mixture ingredients together in a glass bowl. Let the mixture stand for fifteen minutes, and you will see it activating. Mix together the flour, salt, and sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon or spatula. Add the yeast and water mixture to the flour. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Add the egg yolks, vegetable oil, vanilla sugar (if used), banana liqueur or rum and water.  Stir to form a sticky ball of dough using a wooden spoon. If you prefer, you can mix the dough with your hands. Use a pair of gloves so your hands stay clean. Punch down and knead the dough for at least 8 to 10 minutes. Wet your hands slightly and lightly flour the dough as you punch and knead. As you knead and punch the dough, add the lemon zest little by little so that it is evenly spread throughout the dough. Punch down and carry on kneading for at least 8 minutes after adding the zest. It should become a smooth, soft ball of dough after the kneading is over. Oil a large glass bowl.  Place the ball of dough in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean cloth and put it in a warm place to rise such as near the stove or oven while you are cooking other dishes. Let the dough rise for 90 minutes or 1 1/2 hours.  Prepare a clean, floured counter-top or board. Place the dough on the counter-top or board and start punching and kneading it once more, for several minutes before it is rolled out. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll it out to 1/2\" thickness. Cut out about 18 rounds with a two to three inch wide glass.

Fill each doughnut with strawberry or raspberry jam using a pastry syringe or pastry bag. Use a Size 4 nozzle to fill each Sufganiyot with your choice of jam. You can even fill the donuts with Dulce de Leche. Spread powdered sugar on a baking sheet, and roll each Sufganiyot in the sugar till both sides are well coated.  Serve as dessert after dinner. ",
