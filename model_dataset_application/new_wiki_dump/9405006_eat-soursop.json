          "description":"An unripe soursop has a dark green tinted skin. It can take a week or more to ripen. When it does ripen the skin color will change to more of a yellowish tone. A soursop fruit should also feel soft and slightly mushy to the touch when it is ready to eat. A soursop fruit will also ripen in the fridge, although it may take a bit longer. If you eat an unripe soursop it will taste tart and the pulp will be very tough and grainy."

          "headline":"Wash it with warm water.",
          "description":"Before you get ready to eat your soursop, hold the fruit under warm tap water for 2-3 minutes. Rub your hands along the surface of the fruit to remove any dirt or other debris. For an even higher level of cleanliness, you can rinse off the fruit with a produce cleaning solution, which you can buy at the grocery store."

        {
          "headline":"Remove the skin.",
          "description":"The outer skin of the soursop is not edible, so you\u2019ll need to remove it. Score the end of the fruit with your knife, so that your cuts form an \u201cX.\u201d Make it just deep enough to reach past the skin and into the pulp. Then, use your fingers to separate the skin sections. Grab a single section of skin at a time and pull it downward and away from the pulp, effectively peeling the fruit. Peel it like you would a banana. Use your knife to clean up any areas where the pulp isn\u2019t exposed. The soursop has tiny thorns spread over its skin. However, these are usually not firm enough to irritate your skin when handling the fruit."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cut it longways.",
          "description":"Get a sharp paring knife. Lay the fruit down on a cutting board. Holding it firmly, cut it in half down the middle. With a ripe soursop you should be able to make one clean cut. If you would like more access to the seeds, then you can cut it once more into fourths."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Remove the seeds.",
          "description":"When you cut open the soursop you will see custard-colored flesh with a handful of long, smooth black seeds. You can dig into the flesh with a grapefruit spoon and lift out each seed. Some people prefer to use their fingers to feel out each seed. Try to get out all of the seeds, as they contain neurotoxins. Within each of the long seed pods that you see are dozens of smaller seeds. Make sure to carefully dispose of the seeds after removing them, so that no animals or people will have access to them."

          "description":"Get a plastic or glass bowl container with a tight-fitting lid. Place the sections of soursop into the container and seat it tightly. The fruit will last in the refrigerator for about a week."

Another option is to blend the pulp into a paste and then eat the paste with a spoon. A soursop fruit has a flavor similar to a pineapple. Like many tropical fruits, it contains both sweet and sour flavors mixed together."

In the meantime, store the pulp in the refrigerator in an airtight container. If you wait, you\u2019ll also notice that the fruit gets progressively sweeter."

You can place soursop chunks or halves into an oven on 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176 degrees Celsius) and cook for 20-30 minutes or until extra soft. To add even more flavor, sprinkle the soursop with cinnamon or nutmeg prior to roasting. Just like pineapple, you can also place slices of soursop onto a hot grill.
