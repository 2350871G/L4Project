  "text":" Preparation Preheat the oven to 200\u00baC/400\u00baF. Prepare the cake pan by greasing or lining it. Chop the butter into small pieces.  Mixing the Ingredients Sift the flour into the mixing bowl. Add the sugar and stir together. Rub the butter into the flour with your fingertips. Combine until it looks like fine breadcrumbs. Stir the middle to make a well in the mixture. Pour the milk in and stir through with a butter knife. Do not mix too much. Sprinkle flour over the work surface. Place the dough onto it and knead gently. Push the dough down evenly. It should be about 2cm/0.78\". Baking the Baby Scones Press out scones with the small circle cutter. Make about 18-20 scones (if you make a lot less, it's probable that the scones are too large in shape). Put the scones into the cake pan. Stand them next to each other, touching. Then sieve a little flour over the top of the scones in the pan. Place in the oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until they turn golden brown in color. Serving the Baby Scones Remove the scones from the oven. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Then remove and wrap in a clean towel inside a bowl to keep them warm. Cut each baby scone in half. Spread the jam on and add dollops of whipped cream. Display with other petits fours on a cake stand or platter.",
