          "description":"There are two main categories of lawn grasses:  cool season and warm season. The former is best suited to regions with cold winters and warm/hot summers with regular rain. They also can go dormant during droughts. These grasses experience two periods of shoot growth annually: in mid-spring and early fall. Some of the most common cool season grasses in the U.S. are bluegrass (Kentucky and rough), ryegrass (annual and perennial) and Bentgrass. In the U.S., the cool season grass zone stretches roughly from southern New Jersey to central California."

          "headline":"Select warm season grasses for hot, humid climates.",
          "description":"They have a single, expanded shoot-growth episode during the summer. Most varieties require special care during the milder winter months in this climate, when blades tend to turn brown and areas of the lawn may require reseeding. Popular warm season grasses in the U.S. include St. Augustine, Bermuda, Carpetgrass and Centipede. The U.S. warm season zone runs approximately from the coastal Carolinas to southern Arizona. You may need to seed the sod with cool weather grasses for the cooler months in this region. These will die off when the hot weather returns."

          "headline":"Look for transitional grasses in mildly cold winter zones.",
          "description":"Transitional grasses often work best in areas that have cold, but not subzero, temperatures during the winter. As the name indicates, members of the transitional grass family can also reside in either the cool or warm season groups as well. In the U.S., Kentucky Bluegrass, Annual Ryegrass and Tall Fescue often perform best in transitional regions. The U.S. transitional zone obviously sits between the cool and warm season zones \u2014 so, basically from Maryland and Virginia to southern California."

Talk to the pros at local turf farms, nurseries, and garden centers for guidance. Your local university's extension service or even the state department of agriculture can give you localized advice. Also check websites that break up your region into smaller climate zones and make more specific recommendations:  for instance, recommending St. Augustine grass in the U.S. southern Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts, and Buffalo grass in the U.S. Great Plains."

Bahia is popular because it can grow in infertile or sandy ground. Centipede, the \"lazy man's\" grass, also can withstand acidic soil. Make sure to check your soil\u2019s pH level. This is relatively easy to do yourself, or you can have it done by a pro. When it comes time to buy, look for sod that is growing in a similar type of soil to what you have at home, when possible."

          "description":"If your yard has a northern exposure or is somewhat shaded, St. Augustine and Centipede mixtures may be excellent options, depending on your climate. Bermuda, on the other hand, only thrives in bright sunshine. Tall Fescue and especially Fine Fescue are often the best choices if your yard is heavily shaded, but can also do well in more sunny locations."

Bermuda and Zoysia bounce back from stress better than many other types. Tall Fescue also stands up well to regular foot traffic. Centipede and Bentgrass, however, often don\u2019t do as well under heavy traffic, so they may be better suited for a \u201cshow\u201d lawn."

Check with an expert before you make a final selection. Some types grow faster than others, requiring extra mowing and edging. Others may need additional fertilization, irrigation and aeration."

There should be no dry patches. If you do not have sprinklers, you will need to manually water the sod with a garden hose. Fresh sod will need to be watered within half an hour of installation. It is a good idea to water your sod early in the morning rather than later in the day. At most, you should water your lawn twice a week."

That is to say, poorly-grown Bluegrass sod won\u2019t hold up well in your yard, even if that\u2019s the ideal variety for your circumstances. Check out local garden centers, and go straight to sod growers as well. A good supplier will be knowledgeable and ready to answer your questions. Since a pallet of sod can weigh 1 tonne (0.98 long ton; 1.1 short tons), you should also ask if there are any delivery or pallet charges. You may also want to ask if a forklift is available to unload the sod. If you're not sure what type of grass is best suited for your yard, cut out a small section of your existing lawn and bring it along.

Before installing new sod, check with a lawn-care professional for tips on soil preparation. Generally speaking, you don\u2019t need to rip away every blade of old grass, but you do want to churn up the surface soil. But don\u2019t do it more than a day or two ahead of time \u2014 otherwise, rain or animals may create ruts and holes. Do not walk on freshly laid sod.
