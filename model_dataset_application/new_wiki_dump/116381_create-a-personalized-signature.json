Some people sign their entire name, some just their last, and some just their initials. Start by deciding exactly what you want to include in your signature\nIf you\u2019re concerned about forgery, it may be a better option to make your signature a bit longer and legible by including your entire first and last name and writing clearly. It is so much easier to forge scribbled signatures than to copy the nuances of a legible one. Signatures that include just your initials (with or without the middle initial) are typically considered more formal and business-like than full-name signatures. Sometimes, people who don\u2019t like their first name will leave it out entirely and sign with just their surname, or they may include just their first initial."

          "description":"Before moving up into signing your name, start by printing it over and over. You may find that in the process of recreating your printed signature, you automatically begin to add flourishes and details in appropriate areas. Printing your signature will help you to analyze where you want to add or detract, and what should be embellished and what shouldn\u2019t. Determine your favorite qualities of your printed signature. Do you like the slant, size, shapes of certain letters? Keep track of these so that you can recreate them when personalizing your signature. Pay attention to the size of your handwriting. Studies show that people with very small signatures tend to be overlooked, while people with very large signatures often are arrogant or grandiose. Try to keep your printed/signed name at an average size, similar to the size of your regular writing."

          "description":"Before moving from printing to signing, you should aim for a certain level of legibility. Some people\u2019s signatures are equally as legible as their print, while others look like scratches or scribbles on a page and are completely illegible. Although you want to make your signature difficult to replicate (which may come with illegibility), you want to stay true to your personality and avoid cluttering your signature. To make your signature more difficult to read, you can either push letters closer together, or flatten them and spread them further apart. If you don\u2019t want to make your signature easy to read, avoid doing so by leaving out letters or using bad handwriting. These tactics are unprofessional and won\u2019t make your signature look all that great."

Start small, and work your way up to bigger changes in the way you sign your name (rather than jumping into something totally new right away). Some options for changes may include:\nGreatly increasing the size of the capitalized letters in your name. Adding a flourish to the tail ends of letters (particularly \u2018T,\u2019 \u2018Y,\u2019 \u2018E,\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019).

          "description":"When you\u2019ve chosen all that you want to add/detract from your current signature, start the work of incorporating in each aspect into your handwriting. Don\u2019t make a huge change in your signature right away, as it will feel unnatural and you will likely forget some changes that you intended to make. Instead, slowly add and drop elements over the course of a few weeks until you have created a personalized signature. Practice writing your signature on a daily basis to help expedite this process. Consistency is a key element in changing your signature. If you can\u2019t keep your signature relatively the same between each signing, then you should probably limit the number of changes you\u2019re making. When in doubt, less is more. Although you may want to have a hugely elaborate signature, for the first few months that just might not happen. Keep it simple, and over time add more detail."
