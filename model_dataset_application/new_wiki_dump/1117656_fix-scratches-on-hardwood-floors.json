          "description":"Lightly press a clean rag soaked in a bit of mineral spirits onto the wood, focusing on the scratched area. Rub the area where you applied the stain to remove any residual, following the grain of the wood. This application method works best (rather than directly drawing the stain marker over the scratch), because it allows for a gradual addition of stain. If you use the marker to draw and fill in the stain directly, you can saturate the scratch with stain, and end up making the scratch darker than the surrounding wood. Drawing straight onto the scratch like that can make the scratch mark even more obvious."

This protective finish could be a sealant, shellac, or some other kind of polyurethane varnish. Ideally, you would use the same kind of finish that is already on the hardwood floor. Consult an employee at your local hardware store for advice on what kind of finish you should use on the floor. If you are an inexperienced wood worker, or if your hardwood floor has a specialty finish (such as a high gloss polyurethane finish), consider hiring a professional to repair and finish the floor. Since hiring a professional will cost more money, it might be most cost-effective to let scratches accumulate, rather than hiring a company to fix one small scratch."
