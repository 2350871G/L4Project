Adding the Vegetables After removing beef from pot, start to cook the onions and celery over medium heat. Add the remaining teaspoon of vegetable oil and begin cooking the onions and celery over the fond created by the beef. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until onions are soft and translucent, not browned. Add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds. Stir frequently during this time. Add the tomato paste, a pinch of salt, and one tablespoon of the Worcestershire sauce to the onions and celery.

Finishing Your Stew Cover your pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 1 and 1/2 hours. Make sure the stew is simmering, not boiling. Stir the stew every so often. Add the potatoes and carrots to the stew. Cover and cook for 40 to 60 minutes, stirring every so often. Carrots and potatoes are finished when a fork can easily puncture them. Add the peas, Worcestershire, and a tiny bit of red wine to finish off the stew. Untie the bouquet garni and remove it from the pot. Taste and add any needed salt and pepper. Serve. ",
