Poly-fill stuffing is most common, but you can also buy cotton or even bead if you would prefer to work with that material.Stuffing is important to give your animal some structure. You can buy both these materials at an arts and crafts store."

          "description":"There are many pattern pieces that you can find out on the Internet. Pattern pieces are traced onto the felt and then cut out so that you have all the component pieces of your felt animal. You can also try creating your own pattern piece. If you want to make a simple animal like a snake your can use four very elongated football shaped pieces. Make sure all your football shaped pattern pieces are the same size. Measure the width of each piece at its midline to figure out how wide your snake is going to be. Take that number and multiply it by four to get the circumference of your snake. Use this information accordingly as you make the body. You'll  want the length of the snake to be four times larger than the circumference of the snake. Make sure you have enough felt! That's the idea behind making pattern pieces. You can add eyes and a tongue with extra fabric. Remember to leave 1/4 of an inch extra room in the pattern piece for sewing purposes."

Two body pieces, two head pieces, one belly piece, one back piece, one crown piece, and one tail piece. A snake would only have the long four football shaped pieces."

Follow the letters on your design piece. If you aren\u2019t sure what pieces are added where, look at which letters correspond to what pieces.

You can use a sewing machine if you have one available, but felt is easy to work with. You can just use a needle and thread. Assembling Your Felt Animal Cut out the pattern pieces from the felt. You\u2019ll want to enlarge your pattern piece to the size you want your animal to be. Make sure that you allow for a 3-millimeter seam allowance. That means you need that much extra space for the animal to fit together once you stitch it. For example, if you were sewing a mini dog together you would have eight pattern pieces in all.

In the pattern piece layout there will be letters that correspond with where each part connects. For this little dog, you\u2019ll be sewing the two head pieces on top of the two body pieces. Sew the two body pieces together. Now you\u2019ll connect the two pieces. You won\u2019t be sewing all the way around obviously. Only sew the top half of the body together as the letters indicate. For example, if you were making this little felt dog you would start to see the outline of your animal. If you made your own pattern pieces for the snake you'll just want to connect each of them to form a cylinder. Add your connecting and additional pieces. For example, if you were making the little felt dog you would need to add the crown piece to the top of his head. Once the body pieces are together you can start to figure out how to fill in the gaps. The little felt dog also requires a brown speckle on his back to fill in the hole on is back. Connect your belly piece. The belly piece is generally one of the last pieces to add. Using the little dog as an example, you would turn the body pieces upside down and add the belly piece to the bottom around the edge. Don\u2019t forget to leave an opening. You absolutely need this opening so that you can stuff your animal. If you forget to leave the opening you\u2019ll have to undo your stitching or start all the way from the beginning. The little dog example has a hole already built in for stuff, but you might need to leave your own hole. Finishing Up Turn your animal inside out. The little dog pattern piece leaves a hole in the stomach for you to turn your animal inside out, but you might need to leave your own hole if you are making a different felt animal. Stuff your animal. Using the whole you left stuff your animal thoroughly with polyester fiberfill. Make sure the animal is well stuffed but not over stuffed. You want the animal to feel firm without looking like it is going to explode. Use your judgment. Add your embroidery. You can add whatever pieces you want.
