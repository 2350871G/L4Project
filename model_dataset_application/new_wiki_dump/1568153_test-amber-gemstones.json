      "description":"Vigorously rub your amber on some wool for about 20 seconds to create static. Take a strand of hair and place the static-charged amber close to it. Real genuine amber should quickly attract the hair towards it, with the hair gently sticking to the gemstone. If no static is produced after rubbing on wool (ie it doesn't attract the hair) then you might have a piece of fake amber."

Add 25g of salt to 200ml water in a glass and drop your amber into it. Genuine amber should float, not quickly sink to the bottom. Genuine amber reacts to ultraviolet light. Take your amber into a darkened room and  shine a cheap UV torch on it. If it gently glows, it's real."
