          "description":"Obviously, caffeine and kids don't mix. Therefore, it's best to stick to fruity, herbal teas. In addition, these teas are more suited to a kid's palate. Try a cinnamon-apple tea, for instance, or a mint tea. You could also use teas like jasmine or hibiscus. You could brew up a tea punch by boiling fruit in water, such as apples and pears. Throw in some spices, like cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and/or ginger. Near the end, add in a flavorful tea, such as hibiscus, plus sugar to taste. Let it steep until the tea is brewed, and then strain it."

You can also add fresh dill or mint, but you may want to leave that off for kids' sandwiches. Put the sandwiches together, and then cut them into fingers, triangles, or squares."

Start with a bit of mustard or mayonnaise on thin bread without crusts, then top with a thin layer of ham and American or cheddar cheese. Put the sandwiches together and then cut them into shape."

You could also do a single layer of a sweet cream cheese, such as cinnamon or strawberry. For more color, add a layer of strawberries. For another sweet option, try apple butter on raisin bread."

You can also add other flavorful additions, such as dill, Worcestershire sauce, mustard or dry mustard, paprika, black pepper, lemon juice, and/or salt. Spread a thin layer on crustless bread, then top it with another piece of bread. If you're worried about them getting soggy, you can spread a thin layer of butter on the bread before adding the egg salad. Cut them to shape."

For each rabbit, you'll need 1 egg yolk, a dash of cream (about a teaspoon), several drops of Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and 1/3 cup (79 milliliters) of grated cheddar cheese. Mix up the cheese mixture together, and spread it on a toasted English muffin. Broil the rabbits for about 3 minutes, keeping them a bit lower than you normally would when broiling. Add vegetable decorations to make \"rabbits,\" such as a black olive for a nose, chives for whiskers, and snow peas for ears."

For a savory snack, add fillings like pimento cheese, spray cheese, or a savory flavored cream cheese. For a sweet snack, fill with peanut butter (or other nut butter), and top with raisins."
