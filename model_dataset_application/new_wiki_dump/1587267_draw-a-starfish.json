      "headline":"Start with lines (straight or curved) shaped like a star.",
      "description":"This will make sure that your star is nice and star-shaped. This represents the skeleton of your starfish, allowing you to add details to its basic form. Be sure that your lines are a realistic length."

      "headline":"Sketch the form of the starfish.",
      "description":"Using the lines as a guide, draw the outline of the creature's body. Decide whether you want a thin or fat starfish. For a realistic drawing, search pictures of live starfish and use them as references."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Draw the details.",
      "description":"Add in dots or curved lines to create your starfish's unique appearance. Be sure that you are as original in your ideas as possible so that your drawing catches people's eye."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Ink your drawing.",
      "description":"Following the outline of your starfish, trace your drawing with ink for a professional look. Erase guidelines and unnecessary details If you are afraid of making mistakes, make a copy of your drawing so that you can freely experiment. Alternatively, scan your drawing into your computer. Use art software to trace your starfish."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Add shadows and shading.",
      "description":"For a realistic starfish, bring out the natural shadows in its body. Be sure that you add the correct amounts of shading so that it looks like your creature pops out of the drawing. Place emphasis upon the important features of the starfish, such as the legs. However, beware of overdoing the shading, as this can lead to a strange-looking drawing."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Color your starfish.",
      "description":"Choose your favorite shades, and fill in the details. Color pencils or special drawing markers are the best choices for those who wish to color traditionally. Another option is to color the starfish digitally with art software. If you have trouble deciding on the best colors, use pictures of real starfish as references."
