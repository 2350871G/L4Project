Normal wear and tear will eventually leave visible scratches and make the surface dull. Polishing periodically with a buffing pad can renew and refresh its appearance by restoring shine, buffing away microscopic scratches and evening out the floor\u2019s surface. Check the manufacturer's recommendations for polishing products and follow the instructions exactly. Never use wax on a floor with a urethane or other glossy finish."

When routine cleaning no longer restores the floor\u2019s shine, it's time to recoat the surface. How often you need to do this depends on the amount of foot traffic you have in your home. Unless you\u2019ve done it before, you will probably need to contact a professional to refinish your floor\u2019s surface. If your floor surface has deep scratches, visible gouges, discoloration and other significant damage, consider sanding your floor and then refinishing it. Unless you have experience, contact a professional for this. You might have difficulty re-sanding a pre-finished floor. Many new pre-finished floors only have a small core of wood and can only be sanded once."

Encourage visitors and family members to wipe their feet on them. Place additional mats in other high-traffic areas, such as in front of the kitchen sink and down frequently used hallways. A floor mat should also be placed in any area where water might be splashed, like by the kitchen sink. Be sure to use floor mats that are made specifically for hardwood floors. Other types of mats, such as rubber-backed and non-ventilated mats, can trap moisture and debris underneath, causing surface damage to the floor.

If you don't, the debris embedded in the felt may scratch your floor. Never drag a piece of furniture across a hardwood floor.
