Most towns have at least a couple of businesses that loan subcontracted workers out for small projects, like replacing broken tile or fixing a damaged deck railing. Make sure that the company offers the service you need before you call. Handymen are trained to perform a wide variety of tasks, but may not have the expertise needed to tackle more specialized projects, such as building a carport or rewiring an electrical outlet. It\u2019s also advisable to read the fine print in the company\u2019s terms of service. They may charge hidden fees or expect the homeowner to cover the cost of necessary tools and materials."

It\u2019s not uncommon to find flyers and business cards for independent contractors looking for work in these places. Store employees may also be able to offer recommendations for handymen they've supplied in the past. Don\u2019t forget to take a tear slip or jot down the person\u2019s contact info so you can get in touch with them later if you decide to interview them for the job. Before you hire a freelance handyman, plug their name into a search engine to see if you can dig up any reviews from former employers. Some larger home improvement centers like The Home Depot even offer in-house handyman services for select projects through their Home Services department."

Do some research on each of your leading candidates prior to submitting an estimate for your project.

Not only will this allow you to compare pricing and find the rate that best fits your budget, it will also give you the chance to meet with them face-to-face, discover how punctual they are, and get a feel for their professional etiquette. Keep in mind that there are more factors involved in shopping around estimates than just price. The lowest bid will usually be the most attractive, of course, but you may ultimately be more inclined to work with the person who was timeliest and most considerate. A thorough, detailed bid is often a sign of competence and integrity. If a handyman takes the time to break down the cost associated with each step of the project, it shows that they care about doing things the right way and not just collecting a paycheck."

Like the initial bid, this is a good opportunity to evaluate your prospects on both a personal and professional level while ironing out all the important details of the job. Come up with a list of questions to ask the handyman that will offer you a better idea of their qualifications. For example, you might ask them why they chose to become a handyman, how long they\u2019ve been in the business, or what their greatest strengths are."

It's also a plus if the handyman can show you photos of similar jobs that they\u2019ve completed in the past.

However, you always want to ask your handyman to supply proof of insurance up front. At the very least, some form of general liability insurance is crucial. Worker's compensation is also a must if the handyman has other employees working under them. Be sure to review your candidate\u2019s insurance policy along with the rest of their paperwork. A good general liability insurance policy will offer the contractor coverage for at least $1 million per claim.

Don\u2019t sign the contract until you\u2019re satisfied with the terms it lays out. You should always request a contract if it\u2019s your first time working with a particular handyman, even for small weekend jobs. Your contract essentially says that the handyman promises to perform a set of agreed-upon duties in a specified time for a predetermined sum of money. A record like this can come in handy in the event that a dispute arises between you and your handyman.Tip: If you don\u2019t want to go to the trouble of drafting up your own contract (or aren\u2019t sure how), you can find premade forms online to print and fill out."

This means that if the problem reoccurs or something goes wrong with a repair job within the specified warranty period, the handyman will come back and fix it at no additional cost. If the handyman you've chosen to work with offers a warranty, you can rest assured that your project is in good hands. One-year warranties are standard for most remodeling jobs and other large-scale projects. Warranties are a sign of good faith as much as they are a way of attracting business, and are generally useful for distinguishing honest contractors from less-than-honest ones."
