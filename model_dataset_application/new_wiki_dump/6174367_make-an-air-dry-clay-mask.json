      "description":"To do this, you can curve a magazine and stuff some newspaper into the back of it. Once curved into a long semi-circle it can be taped to keep the shape. Alternatively, you can use a PVC pipe cut in half lengthwise. Each will allow a good mold for the mask. Once you have this shape (to avoid the clay sticking to it) insert it into a plastic bag. Put this to the side as you will need it later."

Once shaped the pieces can be attached to the mask by dampening, with a little water, and brushing this onto both sides of the clay. Press the new features into the clay to make sure they are stick together well. Alternatively use small pieces of clay to form shapes like a snake or use a cookie cutter to cut out any shape you like or perhaps even simply scratch some lines into the mask clay. Additional pieces can be attached as before with brushing a little water onto the clay."
