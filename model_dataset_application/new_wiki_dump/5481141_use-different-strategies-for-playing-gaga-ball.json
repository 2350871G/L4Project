  "text":" Learning the rules Set up a gaga pit. It is hexagonal or octagonal standing 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2 m) high. 1 wall is 2\u20133.5 feet (0.6\u20131.1 m) tall so people can get in and out. You can play with any number of people 2 or higher. Get a gaga ball. It shouldn't be especially hard; a volleyball or kickball will work. Learn the rules. Everyone stands in the pit with at least one hand touching the wall. Anyone can serve it and he or she thrown it into the middle. After it bounces twice,  you can move anywhere in the gaga pit and hit the ball with your hands or any part of your body above your waist. Know how losing happens. There are many different ways to lose. If you get hit with the ball below your waist, you have to get out of the gaga pit or restart the game. Another way to get out is called \"double tap.\" If someone hits the ball twice in a row before it bounces off a wall or another person, they are out.

Lastly, if you pick up the ball, you are out. Play until only one person is still in, then you start over, and that person serves. Now you know the rules to gaga ball. Offensive Strategy Use this strategy when you are a very good player. If you can hit the ball hard or skillfully, this approach is for you. Try to hit the ball right after it bounces twice, and hit it at people. Try to hit hard enough so if it misses, it bounces back to you, and you can try again. Hit the ball every which way and get the biggest threats out quickly. Hit hard, move fast. Defensive Strategy Seek to hang in there with this strategy. In the defensive strategy, the goal is to last as long as possible and in the final two, take advantage of the other person who probably used the offensive strategy and is worn out. If people allow it, try turtling. This is hunching over in a corner and putting your hands in front of your legs. It is hard to get someone out who is doing that, except form a side.

The point of this is to dodge the ball so that it won't hit you, and you want to stay in as long as possible. Improve your reactions and try to practice your technique. Jump around a lot and run around the pit, so as to make it hard for the person to aim. Jump around until the last two. If you make it that far, use the offensive strategy or get the last person out. The Luck and Hope Strategy Expect mixed results. This is based entirely on luck and hope. Stand in a corner and hope people don't notice you. Just hope the ball goes past you and doesn't hit you.
