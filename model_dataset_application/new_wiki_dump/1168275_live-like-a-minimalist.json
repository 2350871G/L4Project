Take the initiative and eliminate toxic relationships from your life,  focusing instead on the people who contribute to a happy state of being for you.

Local meetup groups are held in these countries - they offer a unique opportunity to meet other people living the minimalist lifestyle, and to learn more from them.

Do an initial clean up to sort loose papers into categories (e.g. tax papers, warranties and user manuals, bank statements, etc.) Invest in a small filing cabinet or file folders to keep important documents in, and be sure to recycle unnecessary documents (junk mail, store circulars, etc.) as soon as they are no longer relevant to you.

Between gas, repairs, maintenance, and registration, cars are possessions that require our energy and money on a constant basis. Some minimalists require a car because of certain life circumstances (e.g. having children, needing a car for work) but may choose to drive only when necessary. If you are able to go without a car, consider simplifying your life by using public transport, taxis, Uber, or your own two legs instead."

If they are interested in joining you in trying out a minimalist lifestyle, you should discuss some ways to adapt your shared living space and belongings, and to consume in a minimalist way. If they do not wish to live in a minimalist way, discuss the limits and parameters of your minimalist changes in order to compromise on shared spaces, belongings, and consumables. Maintain communication and discuss all possible changes to your living space beforehand to avoid conflicts."
