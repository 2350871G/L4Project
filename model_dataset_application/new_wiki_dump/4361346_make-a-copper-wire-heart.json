  "text":" Bend the wire a bit round with the help of the pliers.  Hold the caliper with the round side where you decide to have the tip of the heart (that depends on the size of the pendant you have in mind).  Tighten the curved tip with the pliers from the point where the wire was bent.  Open the wire from the bent side with the help of pliers carefully \u2014 make sure not to leave any uneven wire. Use your fingers to make a well rounded shape. Round hold the wire and bend rounded fingers with the help of the widest part of the pliers.  Make sure the semicircle is smaller than the one on the other side.  Use the pliers to tighten the curve peaks on the bend point on the wire.  Open the wire and repeat the rounding step again with the pliers rounding the wire with both hands in line with the heart.  Hold the tip with nose-shaped pliers and bend it around.  Fold the wire well with pliers with a pointy end.  Repeat Step 7.  Repeat Step 5.  Hold on to the joining point with the pliers and twist the wire a bit.  Tighten the clamp with round tip pliers.
