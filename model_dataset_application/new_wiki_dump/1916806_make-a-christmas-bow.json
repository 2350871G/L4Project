  "text":" Gift-Wrapping Bow Choose ribbon. Classic Christmas ribbon usually has red, green, or a mixture of the two. You can choose solid red or green ribbon, a plaid design, polka dots, or stripes - when it comes to Christmas colors, personal preference is what matters most. Here are some other ideas that aren't so black and white - or, shall we say, red and green:\nIf you're looking for something different, go for a blue ribbon with silver or white accents. This is a pretty choice that still looks festive enough for the season. Purple is also a nice choice for a Christmas ribbon. Look for a deep, rich hue that's a bit reddish in tone. Anything that sports stars, candy canes, snowflakes, bells, or mittens is a great choice for Christmas, no matter the color scheme. Start by looping your bow around the gift and tying a knot. Cut a length of ribbon long enough to circle the package with several inches to spare on either end. Secure the ribbon tightly so that it won't slip off. Make a loop with the left end of the ribbon. Use your forefinger and thumb to hold the loop in place over the knot. The loop should be smooth with no twists or wrinkles. Create a second loop. Bring the right side of the ribbon around the left loop, then underneath it. Pull it through so that you create a second loop the same size as the first. You're using the same technique you use to tie your shoes. Tighten the bow. Pull the two loops with equal pressure to tighten the knot at their center. Adjust the ends to make the loops look neat and even. Add decorations. Now that you've got your basic bow, consider adding a few decorative elements. You can fasten a bit of wire tinsel to the bow, or tape a small ornament underneath it. Decorative Bow for the Home Choose wide ribbon. To decorate your home, you'll want thick, wide, fancy-looking ribbon. A fabric like velvet adds a nice, classy touch. Ribbon made with wires to help it retain its shape also works well for this bow. Cut a long length of ribbon. You'll need a piece at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) long. For a larger bow, cut a longer length of ribbon. Make a loop at the left end. Start three inches from the end of the ribbon. Use your forefinger and thumb to pinch the bow into a loop. Make a second loop. Gather ribbon to the right of the first loop to create a second loop of the same size right next to it. Now the ribbon should look like a backward \"S\" with a length of ribbon on either side.

Stop about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the end, so you have a tail on either side of the pile of loops. Pinch the loops in the center. Make a center cinch. Use a small piece of florist wire, a thin string, or a smaller ribbon to tie the loops together at the center, where your fingers are holding them in place. Fluff the loops on either side. Once the center is secure, fluff the loops and separate them on either side, so that you can't see where the center is cinched. Finish the bow. Use scissors to cut an inverted \"v\" shape into the ends of the tails for a classic look. Tie a few jingle bells around the center cinch so that they hang down from the middle of the bow. Hang the bow on your wall, on a doorknob, or on a mirror to decorate for the season. Festive Wreath Bow Pick out bright ribbon. Since you're adding this bow to a wreath, pick out ribbon that will contrast with the deep evergreen color of the foliage. Red, silver, and gold ribbon all work well for this purpose. Cut a length at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) long. Wrap ribbon around your hand. Hold the tail end of the ribbon against your palm, using your thumb to keep it in place. Wrap the ribbon around the back of your hand and bring it up over your palm. Keep doing this until the entire ribbon has been looped around your hand. Remove the loops and fold them in half. Be careful to keep the loops in place, stacked on top of one another, when you slip them off of your hand. Cut the middle. Hold the folded stack of loops in one hand so that the center  fold is facing up. Use scissors to cut the the two corners off of the center fold. You've now created the place where the bow will be cinched. Be careful to cut through all of the ribbon layers using a good sharp pair of scissors. Don't cut the corners too close to the middle of the ribbon, or you'll cut it all apart. Tie the cinch. Use a second ribbon or piece of string to tie the cinch between the notches you made. Use a pretty piece of twine or florist wire for a decorative touch. Fluff out the loops. One by one, fan out the loops from the center and twist them toward you. Arrange them so that they create a circular pattern reminiscent of petals. Affix the bow to your wreath. Use a little more florist twine to attach the bow to the bottom of your wreath.",
