      "description":"This is where your creativity comes in. Think of a rumor that's nice and won't hurt anybody/thing. The best rumors are ones that involve the PS4 system and will affect the most amount of people. In this article, my example rumor will be about a new PS5 system."

      "headline":"Type a subject that's eye-catching and is about your rumor, but doesn't give away very many details.",
      "description":"You still want people to open the message, but they won't if you tell them everything in the subject. For my rumor, I put \"PS5\" as my subject."

      "headline":"Type the rumor in the message box.",
      "description":"Make sure it follows the following criteria: 1. Make it sound formal. 2. Type in third-person. No I, me, we, us, etc. 3. Make sure it's about the same thing as the subject. 4. Give them a reason to pass it on other than the fact it's interesting. For example, in mine I put \"If Playstation sees this message get passed around 500,000 times then they'll release the PS5 by January, 2015\". 5. Ask them to copy the exact message and paste it on messages to send to their friends. This is to avoid the facts from the rumor being changed."
