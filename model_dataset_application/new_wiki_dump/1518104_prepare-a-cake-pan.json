      "description":"Apply the chosen grease to the pan accordingly. Coat the pan with butter. Using butter on the interior surface of the pan will result in a darker crust that has a hint of butter flavor. Either melt the butter and apply it to the pan using a pastry brush or hold a slice of butter and rub it over the surface. You can use wax paper to hold on to the butter. You can also put your hand into a plastic sandwich bag to hold the butter. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/43\\/Prepare-a-Cake-Pan-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Prepare-a-Cake-Pan-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/43\\/Prepare-a-Cake-Pan-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Prepare-a-Cake-Pan-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nSpray the pan with a vegetable oil spray. Using spray to coat the pan is a fast solution to preparing your baking pan. This method applies a very light coating of oil to the surface of the pan which is ideal for those looking for healthier alternatives when baking. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/8f\\/Prepare-a-Cake-Pan-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Prepare-a-Cake-Pan-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/8f\\/Prepare-a-Cake-Pan-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Prepare-a-Cake-Pan-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nUse shortening to coat your baking pan.

Apply a mixture of 1 part flour to 2 parts cocoa to the pan by placing the powder in a mesh sieve and sprinkling it over the pan's surface.

The cocoa will enhance the chocolate flavor of the finished baked good and eliminates unsightly white powder that can remain on the finished baked good if just flour is used. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1c\\/Prepare-a-Cake-Pan-Step-4Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Prepare-a-Cake-Pan-Step-4Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/1c\\/Prepare-a-Cake-Pan-Step-4Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Prepare-a-Cake-Pan-Step-4Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nCover the bottom of the pan with parchment paper.
