      "description":"Remember that it doesn't have to be complicated, and you don't have to feed them an entire meal if you don't want to. Cookies, chips, and punch would be plenty. Remember that it is a party, you don't have to serve only healthy food. Collaborate with your kids on this but remember you have the final say."

      "headline":"Plan games and activities.",

      "headline":"Find Christmas music.",
      "description":"This should be upbeat with a relatively fast beat - no Bing Crosby or Nat King Cole for the party. You don't have to play it constantly, but it would be nice for having on when the guests are arriving and during any craft projects or quiet games."

    {
      "headline":"Pick decorations.",
      "description":"Inventory what you have before you run out and buy more though! Your home doesn't have to look like the Christmas isles in a store. Just use what you have."

    {
      "headline":"Buy or make invitations.",
