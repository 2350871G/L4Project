          "description":"Give your bedroom new life and make it feel instantly bigger by simply getting rid of stuff you don\u2019t want or need anymore. Focus on clothes you don\u2019t wear, toys you\u2019ve grown out of, or items that don\u2019t belong in your bedroom. Try using four different boxes to organize all the items in your room: for trash, give away, keep, or relocate. Try to throw away or give away as many things as possible, move others to different rooms, and finally put back all the \u201ckeep\u201d items. Consider whether you are able to store some things in your room elsewhere in the house. Can you put all your off-season clothes in a hall closet or basement? Could toys or clothes you\u2019ve grown out of go to a younger sibling or even a neighbor?"
        },
        {
          "headline":"Organize with cute boxes and drawers.",
          "description":"Use storage containers to easily organize and categorize items in your room. Look for cute or colorful ones that will be decorative as well as practical. Try buying cloth boxes or hanging shelves meant for your closet, where you can designate one for socks, one for belts, one for underwear, etc. On your desk, you could have colorful boxes and trays for papers, pencils, and other school or art supplies. You don\u2019t always have to buy new storage containers. Try creating your own cute and colorful containers by wrapping plain boxes, cans, or bins with patterned paper or fabric for an easy upgrade. You can also add hanging storage to the back of a door with a couple hooks and rods for clothes, jewelry, and accessories."

        {
          "headline":"Clean up the space.",
          "description":"Get your room super clean and tidy before you do any repainting or reorganizing. This will let you visualize changes and move furniture and other items around more easily. Move everything out of your room completely if you\u2019re repainting. If you\u2019ll just be rearranging and decorating, simply take out smaller things to make it easier to move furniture around. Take smaller items off of the surfaces of tables, shelves, or nightstands so they won\u2019t get bumped or broken when reorganizing. This will also let you dust or clean surfaces, and rethink where you might put your smaller objects."

          "description":"If you can repaint the walls in your room, pick a light or neutral color to help make the space feel bigger and more open. Try using different shades of the same color for the walls, trim, and other detailing. Use a different, bright color for your ceiling, which will draw the eye upward and make the ceiling feel higher. Paint two opposite walls a slightly different color to create more interest and make the room seem longer."

          "headline":"Lay down a large rug.",
          "description":"Make sure to use a rug that is very large to make your room feel bigger instead of smaller. Stick to a light color or an elongating pattern to keep it feeling open. Try a rug with a striped pattern to help make the room feel wider. Place it so that the stripes are going in the same direction as the longest orientation of the room. A nice light carpet or wood floors in your room may not need a rug at all and will feel bigger without it. However, a dark floor or one that\u2019s not in good shape will benefit from a light-colored, large rug to cover it."

          "headline":"Pile your bed with blankets and pillows.",
          "description":"Make your bed seem new and extra comfy just by adding bedding to it. Layer on several blankets and colorful accent pillows to create a plush place to sleep and hang out. Make your bed the focal point in your room with lots of bedding, then try to keep the rest of your decor more minimal. This will help draw your eye to the bed and make the room seem bigger. Whether or not you have a daybed, arrange your pillows and blankets to act like a couch for extra seating during the day before it transforms into your bed at night. This could reduce the need for other chairs or sofas in your room."

          "headline":"Supplement natural light with additional lighting.",
          "description":"Keep windows open to let in natural light to your room, which will make it feel bigger and more pleasant. Add mirrors and several sources of light to brighten it at night or or in low natural light. Use curtains or drapes that are the same light color as your walls, or completely sheer. Keep them pulled back during the day to let the full amount of light in. Place small and large mirrors around your room to reflect light and make the space feel even more open. Use several sources of light, like lamps, string lights, or built-in lights to create a bright and cozy atmosphere."

          "headline":"Add a dressing area.",
          "description":"This can be a fun touch to add a girly flare to your room. Choose an area with good lighting. Somewhere by the window would work great. You should also choose an area with paler walls. Place a closet or cabinet full of clothes near this area. Set up a full length mirror just by the cabinet. See if you can find a tailor mannequin online. You can throw a cute dress on the mannequin to signify this is the dressing area."

Choose a variety of photos you want to display. Hang up the Christmas lights in a series of rows somewhere in your room. Clip photos between each light. You will have a fun, cute addition to your room."

You can hang all your sunglasses from the edge of the hanger. You can also paint a white hanger in a color you like. Some stores may sell hangers with cute designs, like polka dots."

What's your favorite movie? See if you can find a poster of that. Look for stickers or bumper stickers with cute expressions that you relate to. You can put these up on a bulletin board above your desk. You can also look for lamps, rugs, and throw pillows with a color or design you like."

You can also make the room appear bigger just by keeping furniture to a minimum and placing it strategically. Keep furniture against the walls to open up the space in a small room, but keep pieces of furniture from touching if possible to make the room feel less crowded.

Find ways to make a bed or seat also act as a way to hold your stuff. If you can buy new furniture, look for items like an ottoman with a storage space inside, or a bed with drawers built in underneath. You can even buy a lofted bed (a bunk bed without the bottom bunk) and keep a desk, dresser, chair, or other larger items underneath. If you can\u2019t buy new furniture, use the space under your bed to store boxes and bins, keep items tucked under a table or desk, or use a trunk as a seating area as well as for storage."

Replace bulky bookshelves and cabinets with floating shelves and cubbies. Try using different-sized storage cubes mounted on the wall for an interesting way to store items by your bed or desk. You don\u2019t have to have fancy shelving to create wall storage. Try painting a simple wooden crate in your favorite color, then hanging it on the wall for easy display and storage of your stuff."
