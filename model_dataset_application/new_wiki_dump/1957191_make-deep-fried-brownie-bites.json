  "text":" Bake the Brownies Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and take out a 9\" x 13\" (23 cm by 33 cm). Do not grease the pan. Place the butter, shortening and chocolate in a saucepan over low heat.  Melt the ingredients slowly, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon.  Remove the mixture from the heat when it has melted and allow it to cool slightly but not enough to solidify. You want to make sure that the mixture is not hot enough to cook the eggs when you add them. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl.  Beat the eggs in a separate mixing bowl with a whisk.  Add 1/4 of the cooled chocolate mixture to the egg, whisking the eggs as you add the chocolate until the chocolate is well incorporated.  Continue adding 1/4 of the chocolate mixture at a time to the eggs, whisking well between each addition.  Stir in the sugar and vanilla using a wooden spoon.  Add the dry ingredients and continue to mix with the wooden spoon until all of the lumps are gone.  Pour the mixture into the baking pan.  Smooth out the batter if necessary so that the top is even.  Bake the brownies for 15 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the brownies comes out clean.  Remove the brownies from the oven.  Allow them to cool completely on the stovetop before covering them with plastic wrap and placing them in the refrigerator for 1 hour.  Batter and Deep Fry the Brownies Place a pan of oil in a Dutch oven and heat the oil to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Measure the temperature of the oil with a candy thermometer. Whisk together the flour, milk, sugar, baking soda and salt in a large bowl and place the bowl next to the stovetop.  Remove the chilled brownies from the refrigerator and slice them with a butter knife into bite-sized pieces, about 1\" (2.5 centimeters) in both length and width.  Roll a brownie bite in the flour mixture until it is thoroughly covered. Using tongs or a mesh sieve, lower the brownie bite into the hot oil. Continue battering brownie bites until the Dutch oven is full but not crowded.  Fry the brownie bites for 3 to 4 minutes or until they are golden brown.  Remove the brownie bites from the pan with tongs or a mesh sieve. Place the brownie bites on a plate that has been covered with three paper towels. The paper towels will absorb the oil from the brownie bites so that they do not turn soggy. Batter and fry additional brownie bites until you have completed the entire batch.  Place confectioner\u2019s sugar in a sieve over the top of the brownie bites. Tap the side of the sieve so that the confectioner\u2019s sugar sifts through and dusts the top of the brownie bites.
