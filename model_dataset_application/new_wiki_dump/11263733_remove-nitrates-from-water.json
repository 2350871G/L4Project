          "description":"There\u2019s no clear evidence that high nitrate levels are a health risk for older children or adults. However, elevated nitrates are a clear danger for fetuses and infants under about 6 months of age. If you\u2019re pregnant or are using water to mix formula for an infant, rely on bottled water if your home water supply has elevated nitrate levels. High nitrate levels can cause methemoglobinemia (sometimes called \u201cblue baby syndrome\u201d) in fetuses and infants. This condition essentially cuts off their oxygen supply from within and can be fatal, but thankfully it is reversible if treated promptly. Elevated nitrate levels are not transmitted through breast milk. To have your water tested for nitrates, contact a laboratory that has been certified by an appropriate government agency (such as the CDC or EPA in the U.S.). For reference, \u201chigh\u201d nitrate levels can be defined variously as follows: 4 mg per kg of body weight per day; 45 mg per liter of water; 10 parts per million (ppm) of water."

          "description":"If relying strictly on bottled water for an infant or pregnant woman is impractical or too expensive, you can instead cut down on the nitrate concentration by mixing your water supplies. By mixing high-nitrate and low-nitrate water, you can reduce the overall nitrate concentration to acceptable levels. For example, say your goal is to get below 10 ppm and your well water is at 19 ppm. If you mix together equal amounts of well water and distilled water (which will have practically zero nitrates), you'll end up below 10 ppm."

          "description":"Nitrates aren\u2019t a microorganism that you can kill off by boiling your water. In fact, boiling the water will only further concentrate the amount of nitrates in it, since some of the water will evaporate but all the nitrates will be left behind. If your water has a nitrate level at or near the max recommendation, and you need to boil it to remove other pathogens, dilute it with bottled or distilled water afterward."

Likewise, chemical water purification treatments, like adding chlorine or iodine, won\u2019t do the job. Removing nitrates from water requires specialized filtration methods. That\u2019s why, even if you have a home water filter, it\u2019s important to have your water tested if it\u2019s at risk for having elevated nitrates\u2014for instance, because you use well water or live near a large farm or animal feed lot."

The water is then piped to your faucet or whole home. The resin is recharged with chloride ions by an adjacent tank filled with sodium chloride brine. Ion exchange units look and work much like household water softener units, but they are uniquely designed to remove nitrates. You\u2019ll have to regenerate the brine tank with sodium chloride on a regular schedule, as recommended by the manufacturer. This method also makes the \u201cclean\u201d water more corrosive, so you\u2019ll need to use a water softener or other neutralization method as well."

The membrane \u201ccatches\u201d the nitrate ions and lets the water pass through on its way to your faucet or entire home. Reverse osmosis can remove 80-90% of nitrates from water, which means it may not reduce water with extremely high nitrates to a level below the recommended max. Reverse osmosis is slow and energy inefficient\u2014only about 10% of the water makes it through the membrane, while the rest is discarded through wastewater piping. You\u2019ll also have to replace the membrane on a regular schedule, as per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations."

Distillation involves boiling the water to kill pathogens and leave behind nitrates and other materials, then collecting, cooling, and condensing the steam into usable water. Unlike simply boiling water, in which case the nitrate-free steam is wasted, distillation collects this steam and turns it into nitrate-free water. Distillation is a slow process\u2014it can take a home unit 4-5 hours to produce 1 US gal (3.8 l) of water. It also uses a great deal of energy and adds heat to your home."
