Also, if you want your frosting to be a certain color or flavor, you should put it in now. When not using, keep away from heat and direct sunlight. It may be best to cover the bowl with a damp cloth. Chocolate Ganache For this decadent icing, you will need: 1 cup of chocolate, roughly chopped 1 cup of heavy cream 2 tbsp of butter Place your chocolate in a heat-proof bowl and set it aside. Meanwhile, pour your heavy cream into another heat-proof bowl. In a pot, heat some water to just under boiling point. When the water is hot enough, place the bowl of cream on top. Make sure that the bowl is not touching the water. Bring the cream to a simmer. Let it simmer there for a few minutes before bringing off the heat. Set it down and pour the chocolate into the cream.
