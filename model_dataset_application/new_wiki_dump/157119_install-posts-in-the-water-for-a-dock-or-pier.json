          "description":"In addition to remaining constantly waterlogged, your pilings will be subjected to tiny organisms that feed on wood, so you need something that will hold up over time. Pressure-treated wood has been preserved with special chemicals that will help it last longer when it\u2019s exposed to harsh outdoor conditions. It's also the most cost-effective option. Other options for pilings include plastic-coated wood and heavy-duty aluminum. Typically, pilings should be 6\u20138 in (15\u201320 cm) in diameter, but if your deck will weigh more than 10,000 lb (4,500 kg), choose 10\u201312 in (25\u201330 cm) pilings. You\u2019ll need to place a post about every 10 ft (3.0 m) along the dock in order to support its weight."

          "headline":"Rent a 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) water jet from a home improvement store.",
          "description":"Often, your local home improvement store will allow you to rent high-powered tools like a water jetter (which may also be called a hydro jet) for a short amount of time. This will prevent you from having to pay full price for a tool that you won\u2019t use very often. The cost of renting a water jet will vary depending on your location and the length of time you need it. These high-powered water pumps typically run on gasoline, and they come with either a 2 in (5.1 cm) or 3 in (7.6 cm) diameter hose. Either size will work, but since the hose gets heavy when it\u2019s full of water, the 2 in (5.1 cm) hose may be easier to use. If you don\u2019t have access to a water jetter, you may be able to use a high-pressure garden hose instead, but the process will probably take longer."

          "description":"As you start to sink the pilings, it can be hard to keep track of how far they\u2019ve gone into the ground. By marking them with spray paint, it will be easier to make sure your pilings are all installed at the same depth. Burying the piling 4\u20136 ft (1.2\u20131.8 m) into the ground should give you a tight, secure fit."

Measure from the bed beneath the water to the maximum water line, then add on the depth that you plan to bury the pilings to get their total height. Even in a body of water that isn\u2019t affected by tides, the water level may still fluctuate. If you\u2019re not sure what the maximum water line is, ask other pier or dock owners in your area. Cut the beams a little longer than you\u2019ll need them. You can always trim them later if you need to."

If you don\u2019t have anyone who can help you, use sturdy pieces of wood and a pulley system to create a tripod that can lift and hold the pilings in place."

As this is happening, guide the piling further down into the earth until you reach the desired depth. If you need to, move the tip of the hose from side to side so the piling can go in evenly. Repeat this process for the remaining pilings. If the force of the water isn\u2019t enough to remove the sand, attach a PVC pipe with a 1 in (2.5 cm) diameter to the end of the hose to increase the pressure. Use the water jetter to push some of the dirt back into place after the piling is set."
