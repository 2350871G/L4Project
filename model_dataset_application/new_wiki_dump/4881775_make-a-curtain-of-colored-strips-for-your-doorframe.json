Painting the Paper Choose the paint colors you are going to use. If using more than one color, choose your pattern carefully. Cut the blank pieces of paper into inch-thick strips, or whatever size is appropriate. Make sure the strips come out even. Begin painting the strips. Start with your first color if you are using more than one color. Stop painting once you have gotten four strips, if that is the desired length.
