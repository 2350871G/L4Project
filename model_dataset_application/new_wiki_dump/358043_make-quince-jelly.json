After a few seconds, touch it. If it feels like jelly and slightly resists your touch, it's ready. If it's wet like juice, keep cooking it. You can also determine whether the jelly is ready by checking its temperature. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature; the jelly should be ready when it reaches 220 \u00b0F (104 \u00b0C)."

  "text":" Cooking the Quince Prepare the quince for cooking. Wash each quince in cool water. Stem and core the fruit and cut each one into chunks. Leave the peel intact. Cook the quince . Place the pieces in a large soup pot or stew pot. Add enough water to cover all of the pieces by about an inch. Bring the water to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook the quinces for 45 minutes or so, until the pieces are soft. To test whether the quince pieces are done, poke them with a fork.

Use the back of a wooden spoon or a spatula to press the pulp when the straining time is nearing an end, to extract the last drops of juice. Cooking the Jelly Add sugar to the juice. Measure the final amount of juice you end up with after the straining process is complete. Pour it into a large, clean pot. Stir in just under a cup of sugar for every cup of juice. If you like very sweet jelly, add a full cup of sugar for every cup of juice. For jelly that is tangy and not too sweet, reduce the sugar by a teaspoon per cup and add a few teaspoons of lemon juice. Bring the juice and sugar to a boil. Stir the mixture constantly so the sugar doesn't get stuck to the sides and bottom of the pot.

You can also determine whether the jelly is ready by checking its temperature. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature; the jelly should be ready when it reaches 220 \u00b0F (104 \u00b0C). Canning the Jelly Ladle the jelly into  sterilized jars. The cooked jelly is very hot, so be careful as you lower it into the jars. Fill each one to about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) below the rim, then place the seal and lids on the jars. Lower the jelly jars into boiling water. Let them sit for a few moments until you hear the lids pop, which indicates that the seals have been activated.
