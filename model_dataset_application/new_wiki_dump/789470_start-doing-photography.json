It doesn't matter how many megapixels it can capture or how expensive it is. Start with what's affordable and buy used gear as you learn more. Consider purchasing a refurbished camera that you can learn on. Regardless of what type of camera you buy, it's important to read the owner's manual.

Or Gozal, photographer, tells us: \"A simple camera is great for learning the basics and getting a solid foundation. For tighter budgets, experimenting with phone photography first is perfectly fine! If you\u2019re ready to get a camera, though, an entry-level DSLR is a good way to go. I started out with a Canon Rebel T3; in the current market, I\u2019d pick a Canon T6i or a Nikon D3300.\""

          "description":"To have more control over your images, specifically the light and blurring of the background, use a prime lens. This lens is fixed so it doesn't zoom. A prime lens is useful when you're still learning how to balance aperture, shutter speed, and image sensitivity. A common prime lens to start with is a  50mm 1.8."

          "headline":"Buy several memory cards so you have backup storage.",
          "description":"It's easy to think that if you have 1 large memory card, you're all set. Unfortunately, memory cards can become lost or stop working over time. Purchase a few memory cards in different storage sizes and keep a few in your camera bag so you always have access to memory. Memory cards usually last between 2 and 5 years, so you'll need to replace them occasionally."

          "headline":"Get a tripod to capture crisp images.",
          "description":"Purchase an inexpensive tripod that you can secure your camera to. The tripod will stabilize your camera so you can take shots with a longer shutter speed without getting blurry images. For example, you can take pictures in the evening when the lighting is low. If you can't buy a tripod, set up a stack of books or place your camera on a flat post to steady it."

          "headline":"Store your gear in a camera bag.",
          "description":"Get a camera bag or backpack that holds your camera, any lenses you want to carry, and your tripod. Ensure that the bag is comfortable to carry around or you'll be less likely to actually use it. Most camera bags have small compartments for lenses, filters, and memory cards."

          "headline":"Install photo-editing software on your computer.",
          "description":"Editing your images on the computer is a large part of creating great pictures. Choose a photo-editing software that has tools you think you'll need in post-production, such as adjusting color balance and playing with contrast. Capture One Pro, Adobe Lightroom, and Photoshop are popular photo-editing programs. Make sure the image you take is not blurry."

          "headline":"Photograph things that inspire you.",
          "description":"Find what you're really passionate about photographing and spend lots of time taking pictures of it. Instead of trying to take perfect pictures, try to capture what made you excited about the shot or what sparked delight. For example, if you love to travel, take pictures of everything on your trip. Over time, you might find that you're particularly drawn to photographing architecture or people that you meet."

        {
          "headline":"Work on composing your shots.",
          "description":"As a beginner, take photographs of everything that draws and holds your attention. Pay attention to what's in your camera's viewfinder before you capture the image. A classic photography trick is to compose the picture by the rule of thirds. Imagine your frame is divided into thirds going horizontally and vertically. Then place interesting subjects along these lines. For example, instead of taking a photograph of a tree in the middle of your frame, move the camera so the tree is off to the bottom left of the frame and you can see the valley behind it. If you'd like to take an extremely close up photograph of something, such as a flower or bug, use your camera's macro mode. This will allow you to capture rich details."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Adjust the distance between your subject.",
          "description":"Once you've found something you'd like to photograph and composed a shot, take a few pictures. Then move closer to the subject so it fills the frame and take a few more pictures. Walk around to photograph from different angles and then walk farther away from your subject. You might find that photographing even closer or farther away will give you a better image than the one you imagined. This is a great trick to try if you're struggling to come up with a shot. Just start moving around your subject until something catches your eye."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Play around with the exposure triangle to have more control.",
          "description":"You'll probably start taking photos using your camera's automatic settings. Keep shooting automatic until you're ready to start learning more and being more creative. When you start photographing in manual, you'll be able to control aperture, shutter speed, and image sensitivity. These work together to determine the quality of the photo you take.Tip: If the manual is overwhelming, try focusing on just 1 element at a time. For example, make aperture a priority setting before combining other exposure settings. For example, imagine you want to photograph a track race. If you shoot in automatic, the camera will probably freeze the action to create a still image. If you'd rather take a picture where the runner is blurred and appears to be moving fast, use manual to slow the shutter speed."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Find time to practice as much as possible.",
          "description":"The best way to improve your photography skills is to photograph as often as you can. To make things interesting, give yourself challenges and show your photos to a photography mentor or friend. For example, challenge yourself to photograph action shots one day. Photograph nature scenes the next day. Then shoot food or fashion images the following day. Consider enrolling in a photography class or taking a workshop where you can get one-on-one feedback."
