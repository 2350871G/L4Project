          "description":"A claw hammer is the most common type of hammer and is identified by the claw shape on the head of the hammer. Use a claw hammer for basic hammering tasks such as driving nails into wood or other materials and using the claw to remove nails from a surface. A heavy-duty claw hammer, known as a framing hammer, is useful if you need more leverage to remove or drive larger nails on larger construction projects. A 16 ounces (450 g) claw hammer is a great general-purpose hammer to have around."

          "description":"A ball-peen hammer has a smaller head with a curved end that is useful for striking hard surfaces such as metal. The smaller size of the head also makes it a useful hammer to drive nails or rivets in narrow or hard-to-reach spaces. Ball-peen hammers are also useful for tampering metal around a curve or the edge of a surface. The rounded shape of the head of the ball-peen hammer prevents the force of a hard surface from cracking the head of the hammer."

          "description":"A sledgehammer is a heavy tool with a long handle that requires 2 hands to swing. They\u2019re useful for demolition projects such as knocking down brick walls or punching through drywall. Sledgehammers are best used to break things apart, rather than construct or repair them."

          "description":"A rubber or wooden mallet is a good option for lightweight items and materials that you don\u2019t want to damage by striking too hard. Wooden mallets are useful to use with wood chisels and carpentry. A rubber mallet is useful for tampering items such as furniture without damaging the surface. Rubber mallets are lightweight and safe enough to be used for general tasks such as driving tent stakes into the ground or leveling a stepping stone in the ground. Use a wooden mallet to tap the back of a wood chisel to ingrain designs into wood."

          "headline":"Use a specialty hammer for highly specific tasks.",
          "description":"Some tasks require hammers designed specifically for them such as a wood-shingle hammer to measure, shape, cut, and install wooden shingles on a roof without damaging them. When a task is too specific for a common type of hammer, go with a specialty hammer to complete it properly. Using the wrong type of hammer for a specific task can cause you to damage the surface. For example, if you used a claw hammer to repair a bracelet, you would likely damage the bracelet and could injure yourself in the process. Visit your local hardware store to see if they have specialty hammers that suit your needs or search online for one. Specialty Hammer Examples\nBrick hammer: A hammer with a sharp edge and a flat face on the head designed to set and cut stone and brick. Chasing hammer: A small, lightweight hammer designed to shape, repair, and make metal jewelry. Body mechanic\u2019s hammer: Used to remove dents from the side panels of automobiles. Lineman\u2019s hammer: A cross between a small sledgehammer and clawhammer that\u2019s useful for work on utility poles. Welder\u2019s hammer: Features a spring-shaped handle designed to disperse heat while using a blow torch."

For remodeling or construction projects, use a waffle-faced hammer so you can drive more nails into the materials more quickly. If leaving imprints isn\u2019t a concern, go with a waffle-faced hammer. Use waffle-faced framing hammers for construction projects."

Hammers with smooth and small faces are often more lightweight so you can use gentler, more controlled strikes to drive nails into softer surfaces."
