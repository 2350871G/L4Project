Then move onto the heel section of the strap, before adjusting the side section last. Aim to fit about a finger width between each section of the strap and your foot. The tighter the strap by your heel, the more it will push your foot forward. This means that if the strap feels too tight in between your toes, loosen the heel section of the strap."
