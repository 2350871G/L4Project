  "text":" Using a Scrapbook Photo Album Buy a scrapbook photo album from a store or website. It should have a space on the front cover to insert a photo. Display a photo of your choice on the front cover. Make sure it is the correct size to fit the dimensions in the scrapbook's space. Include enough blank pages in the scrapbook photo album for guests to sign and write on. Choose light-colored paper for easier readability. Using a Matted Frame Buy a matted frame online or from a store. The mat can be used in place of an actual album or book for guests. Select a photo related to the occasion for the guest book. If the event is a wedding reception, for instance, try picking a professionally-shot engagement photo to be framed. Place the photo on the mat. Leave the matted photo on a table for guests to sign and write messages in the space around the photo. After the event, frame your matted photo and hang it or place it somewhere for display. Using a Digital Photo Website Use a digital photo website such as Shutterfly to create a guest book with a photo on the front cover. This option may allow you to add printed photo captions and writing suggestions to your guest book's pages. Keep the layout of your guest book simple. Blank pages for guests to write in should be white, gray (grey) or another light color. Choose photos to include in your book. Consider pictures of non-human subjects, if appropriate, such as an engagement ring photo for a wedding guest book. Using Loose Stationery Provide guests with pages of stationery or other paper to write on.  Have a professional bookbinder later assemble the pages into a guest book. Ask if they can include a space or frame on the front cover for inserting a photo.",
