The best positions are usually going to be out in the open where the enemy will not expect you. Most of the time though you can only take one or two shots from out in the open before you are found. Another good position is on the corner a building this will give you cover from enemy fire. Here are the pros and cons of some other positions:\nRoof tops while being good for viewing the battle can be detrimental to your ability to snipe. If you must go on a rooftop do not stay long and make sure that if you know you are going to stay for a few shots make sure you stay behind something on the roof and place a CLAYMORE on the top of the ladder so that an enemy soldier that come up the ladder has a nice welcoming present and this will give you time to exit this location. Roof tops are generally safer further away from active areas. Try to choose one where you still have a good view but is away from the main combat areas. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/89\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-8Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-8Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/89\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-8Bullet1.jpg\\/aid11478-v4-728px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-8Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nCranes are extremely effective places to snipe from, as they are high up, and some people falsely believe they are bad, so people don't always look there.

          "description":"Essentially, a sniper is useless against enemy armor. So when a tank decides to run you over for laughs, you can't really do much except make the most of your grenades and claymores. This of course, encourages him to shoot you instead. The spotter steps in to assist the sniper in tight fixes. Or at least provide warning when something dangerous is nearby. Special forces: They are possibly the best spotters for infiltration. Cover his back against enemy infantry while he plants the all-important C4 charge. If he knows what he's doing, the enemy can be pinned down for over 5 minutes while you pick off infantry and he sabotages vehicles, artillery, etc. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6d\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-24Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-24Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6d\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-24Bullet1.jpg\\/aid11478-v4-728px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-24Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nAssault: Not preferred due to the lack of more effective explosives.

          "description":"The best way to infiltrate an enemy outpost is by flying in a plane and paradropping before you're shot down. The downside is that this wastes the time it takes to spawn 1 plane. And air support is crucial in the overall scheme. Also, if the pilot decides not to jump out, you're stuck without a spotter, making the entire operation useless. Another way is by using a fast, light vehicle like a buggy and sidestepping the entire combat zone. Ditch the vehicle 300 meters (984.3 ft) from the chosen position. It makes it harder to pinpoint where the sniper team is. A black hawk transport also a good way to get behind, but watch yourself. Fighter pilots see a flying black hawk as a sitting duck."

Do not stick too close to your spotter throughout the operation, as they aren't wearing camo outfits, and you might get hit by collateral damage. Never go to the crate at the same time. This takes time, but should some creep come up to where he thinks you are and you're both facing away, kiss the op goodbye. When it's time to leave, play to your spotter's strengths.

  "text":" Steps Learn to relax, and let your enemies wander around until you can make consistent kills/hits, and always try to go for head shots when you're in a concealed environment.  Know your sniper weapon systems. The most effective rifles for sniping are closed bolt action rifles, such as the .50cal M95 Barret unlock (this gun can penetrate armored glass, which no other rifle can do). The damage effectiveness for each sniper rifle varies per weapon. The strongest weapon is the M95 sniper rifle. A single  body shot from this gun will reduce the enemy's health to 5%. The M24 and L96A1's body shots will only reduce an enemy to 10% health. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3c\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3c\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\\/aid11478-v4-728px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-2Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Learn how to sight, range, and tell how fast your target is moving. The target range for the Barret m95 is 200 meters (656.2 ft), after that you must use the drop scope, and offset your crosshair ahead of your target. However, the price for the rifles power is accuracy, the U.S. sniper rifle(the M24) and the sniper unlock for the expansion, Special Forces, are extremely accurate. and have much thinner crosshairs than the M95, making longer shots easier to line up. Set up claymores if you're posting by tight flanks where enemies can pop out, or sneak around you. If anti-snipers are after you, claymores will provide a kill, early warning, and more opportunity. Know your scope: Each rifle has a different scope(crosshairs), and you must learn how you use the drop on your own.  Do not shoot at everything! Never send more than three shots at a single target. Rotate fire. Take some time between shots to make it harder for them to pinpoint your position. When going for moving targets, shoot in front of them. Kill the enemy that has the most threat potential, i.e. tank gunner positions,fixed AA,AT,machine gun posts.These are also very easy because the enemy is fixed in place. An enemy killed whilst inside a vehicle cannot be revived either, so it's a guaranteed kill. Position yourself effectively. If you do not have a good position on your enemy it can cost you your life and can cost your team points and possibly a loss.When moving to a position try to be as inconspicuous as possible. The best positions are usually going to be out in the open where the enemy will not expect you. Most of the time though you can only take one or two shots from out in the open before you are found. Another good position is on the corner a building this will give you cover from enemy fire. Here are the pros and cons of some other positions:\nRoof tops while being good for viewing the battle can be detrimental to your ability to snipe. If you must go on a rooftop do not stay long and make sure that if you know you are going to stay for a few shots make sure you stay behind something on the roof and place a CLAYMORE on the top of the ladder so that an enemy soldier that come up the ladder has a nice welcoming present and this will give you time to exit this location. Roof tops are generally safer further away from active areas. Try to choose one where you still have a good view but is away from the main combat areas. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/89\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-8Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-8Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/89\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-8Bullet1.jpg\\/aid11478-v4-728px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-8Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nCranes are extremely effective places to snipe from, as they are high up, and some people falsely believe they are bad, so people don't always look there.

In fact, every time you make a successful shot on a moving target, try a little bit harder to find moving targets, eventually you will be good enough to take almost anyone down, moving or not. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b3\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-10Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-10Bullet4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b3\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-10Bullet4.jpg\\/aid11478-v4-728px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-10Bullet4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nPosition the reticle for the long range shot on your enemies head right at the scalp.

These are pointless shots and will waste ammo and expose your position. Practice! Sniping takes a lot of RDR (rounds down range). Practicing against bots may be kind of boring and easy but try to turn it into a fun game rather than just sniping them. Bots are good targets and they move erratically and are dependable when you begin sniping. Close quarters combat. Know that your pistol,claymore and grenades are your only CQB weapons. Pistol: Aim for the head with your pistol otherwise a decent enemy will finish you off very quickly. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/03\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-13Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-13Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/03\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-13Bullet1.jpg\\/aid11478-v4-728px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-13Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nClaymores: Place them in areas that are highly-trafficked by the enemy and use them to protect your rooftop positions. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/07\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-13Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-13Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/07\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-13Bullet2.jpg\\/aid11478-v4-728px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-13Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nGrenades:Throw grenades to get your enemy to back off of your position or give you enough time to get back to your friendlies. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/80\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-13Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-13Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/80\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-13Bullet3.jpg\\/aid11478-v4-728px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-13Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Do not drive vehicles to your position for sniping and if you have to to get to it quickly try to place the vehicle in the most inconspicuous place you can.  Use the pistol! It's an under appreciated weapon. Target their torso, and strafe as you fire. Use that claymore if all else fails; even though the enemy may kill you, if you get that mine down in time, he will be killed by the mine because he is so close to it.  Watch your back! If you hear footsteps, and can't see an ally on the HUD then get up and pull out your knife or your pistol. If you kill an enemy as a sniper, they are likely to come back, as a sniper. so if you get a kill and there is no enemies or little enemies then change your position. It is good to have 3 or more positions that you can snipe from. Get a kill and then switch position. An easy way to get kills is, use the M95 Barret and camp the enemies airfield. when they get into a copter or a jet then shoot them as there engine is warming up. If there are a lot of enemies, take only up to 2 shots, then move on.  If sniping behind an object, always crouch or go prone when reloading.  Get a ruler and learn what an eighth of an inch looks like, at extremely long distance aim an eighth above them for instant kill. If they are running aim an eighth in front of them. Infiltration Pick a spotter. Essentially, a sniper is useless against enemy armor. So when a tank decides to run you over for laughs, you can't really do much except make the most of your grenades and claymores. This of course, encourages him to shoot you instead. The spotter steps in to assist the sniper in tight fixes. Or at least provide warning when something dangerous is nearby. Special forces: They are possibly the best spotters for infiltration. Cover his back against enemy infantry while he plants the all-important C4 charge. If he knows what he's doing, the enemy can be pinned down for over 5 minutes while you pick off infantry and he sabotages vehicles, artillery, etc. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6d\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-24Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-24Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/6d\\/Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-24Bullet1.jpg\\/aid11478-v4-728px-Become-an-Effective-Sniper-in-Battlefield-2-Step-24Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nAssault: Not preferred due to the lack of more effective explosives.

The best way to infiltrate an enemy outpost is by flying in a plane and paradropping before you're shot down. The downside is that this wastes the time it takes to spawn 1 plane. And air support is crucial in the overall scheme. Also, if the pilot decides not to jump out, you're stuck without a spotter, making the entire operation useless. Another way is by using a fast, light vehicle like a buggy and sidestepping the entire combat zone. Ditch the vehicle 300 meters (984.3 ft) from the chosen position. It makes it harder to pinpoint where the sniper team is. A black hawk transport also a good way to get behind, but watch yourself. Fighter pilots see a flying black hawk as a sitting duck. Choosing a position. Just choose one. Read the guidelines above. Choose an objective. Are you just going to kill a few troops and get out? Paralyze enemy movement? Pin down enemy armor? Maybe take down artillery batteries and UAV trailers? Choose one that suits your spotter. Holding the line and extraction. This requires the support of your commander. As long as you're holding the line, you'll need a supply drop to keep stocked on ammo, and so will your spotter. God willing, the commander won't drop the crate in plain sight and mark you for dead. Do not stick too close to your spotter throughout the operation, as they aren't wearing camo outfits, and you might get hit by collateral damage. Never go to the crate at the same time. This takes time, but should some creep come up to where he thinks you are and you're both facing away, kiss the op goodbye. When it's time to leave, play to your spotter's strengths. Is he a good pilot? Get a plane. Does he maneuver well? Try a tank. Does he need you to kill anti-tanks while he speeds away? Get in the back of a hummer. Do you have a light vehicle you used to sidestep the map when you got in? Use it then.",
