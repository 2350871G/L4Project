Because of their pierce armor, Huskarls are unusually well-equipped to bring down castles. Champions get the job done as well, but are more susceptible to the Castle's arrows. Usually, other infantry are slaughtered in large numbers. Champions can be spammed as well if you are getting low on resources. They have a slightly greater attack than Huskarls. Trebuchets, while almost required for other civilizations, have a lesser priority than the Huskarls. The main point of Trebuchets is to bring down difficult-to-reach or heavily fortified buildings. However, if your opponent is heavily fortified with walls, Trebuchets should be created. Other siege weapons can be created if you wish, but the advantage of the Huskarl's speed is negated when they are traveling together with the siege units. It is recommended that you set your army to staggered formation in order to reduce the splash damage by Mangonels and Scorpions."
