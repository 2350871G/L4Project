These drinks have only fruit juice in them, so they are somewhat healthier for your kids than drinks that only contain a small percentage of fruit juice, as the rest of the drink is made up of basic sugar water and artificial flavors. On the label, you should see the words \"100% juice.\" In the ingredients, you won't see any added sugar, such as \"high fructose corn syrup,\" \"sugar,\" \"honey,\" or \"corn syrup.\" Instead, you'll see ingredients such as \"apple juice from concentrate,\" \"grape juice,\" or \"cranberry juice.\""

          "description":"Another option is vegetable juice, which is healthier for your child because it is less sugary than fruit juice. However, many kids don't like pure vegetable juice, so try one of the blends that includes both fruit and vegetable juices. Once again, you should see the words \"100% vegetable juice\" on the label. The ingredients should be made up of things like \"tomato juice,\" \"celery juice,\" \"beet juice,\" or \"onion juice from concentrate.\""

However, nutritionally, you won't see much difference between the two, as long as you're picking 100 percent juice. In other words, if you see \"orange juice from concentrate\" on the label, that is nutritionally pretty much the same as \"orange juice.\""

If it has ingredients like \"sugar\" or \"high-fructose corn syrup,\" then it's not pure juice.

Therefore, it's a good idea to switch up the juices your kids are drinking, so they get a variety of vitamins. Try apple, red grape juice, pomegranate juice, orange juice, pineapple juice, grapefruit juice, and tomato juice just to name a few. Berry juices are also good choices."

After 6 months, babies can start to drink small amounts of water, but make sure to discuss this with your pediatrician. Juice can take away from the nutrition they need to get from those other sources, and babies don't need the added sugar. Some sources suggest waiting until kids are 2-years-old before giving them juice. Children who don't have juice won't crave juice, which will keep their sugar intake lower."

This will cut down on the sugar and calories while still giving your child the taste of juice. If your older kids like the taste of juice but you'd like to cut back on their sugar, try adding a dash of juice to water and sparkling water. It may take your kids some time to adjust, but they'll soon like this refreshing beverage."

The whole fruit has fiber, whereas the juice does not, helping them to feel full. Juice contributes to your child's overall calories, but it doesn't help them feel as full. For instance, if your child asks for orange juice, ask if they want an orange instead. Similarly, you could offer an apple instead of apple juice, along with a cup of water."

Another way to make water more fun for kids is to add pieces of fruit for a light flavor. You can add lemon, lime, grapefruit, or orange wedges, or slices of strawberries or cucumber, for instance.
