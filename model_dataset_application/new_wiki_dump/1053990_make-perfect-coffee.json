To explore more flavors, experiment with roasts ranging from mild light roasts to the darkest, charred beans. There are actually many degrees of roast that fit into \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201cdark,\u201d so try several, comparing the color of the beans. While extra-dark roasts have become \u201csophisticated,\u201d many coffee lovers prefer a medium or medium dark roast that doesn\u2019t scorch away the unique flavors of the bean. If you\u2019re serious about finding your perfect cup, learn to roast your own beans. Once you\u2019ve had some practice, you can make the freshest coffee possible with perfect control over the roast strength."

          "description":"Make sure your coffee manufacturer has nothing to hide. The label should state the type of bean (arabica or robusta) and the country of origin. A blend sourced from multiple countries may mean the manufacturer is choosing cost over quality, but there are certainly high-quality exceptions. The real danger sign is a label that doesn\u2019t provide this information at all. In your quest for perfect beans, choose 100% arabica beans, or a blend with a small proportion of robusta if you enjoy more caffeine. Not all arabica beans are top notch, especially if sold as a dark roast, but the best examples are much tastier and less bitter than robusta."

Kitchen supply stores sell a great solution: ceramic containers with a latch lid, lined with a rubber band. Sealed plastic tubs or zip-locked bags are okay, but not as airtight. Temperature changes cause flavorful liquids to condense and evaporate. Keep beans at room temperature, or in the fridge if your kitchen is hot. Freeze only if you have too many beans to use in the next few weeks."

          "description":"Coffee grounds will lose flavor the longer you delay. For best results, grind at home using a burr grinder. If you only have a blade grinder, test out the more precise burr method by having your beans ground at a coffee store (not a grocery store), and using them right away. The size of the grind depends on the brewing process:\nFor a French press or cold brew coffee, make a coarse grind, with chunky particles similar to potting soil. For drip coffee, make a medium grind, the texture of coarse sand. For espresso, make a fine grind, the texture of sugar or salt. If your coffee tastes too bitter, try a coarser grind. If your coffee tastes flat, try a finer grind."

Use two tablespoons (30 mL) for a one-serving press, or fill to the mark on the side of the press. Pour hot water to the halfway mark, wetting all the grounds. After one minute, stir the floating grounds gently. Add the remaining water and put on the lid, with the plunger pulled fully up. After three additional minutes, press slowly down until the plunger hits bottom. Keep the plunger flat. Pour into a cup.

Place over your cup and brew as follows:\nPour coffee grounds into the filter. Shake gently to make it level. Measure according to preference, or about 2 tbsp (30 mL) per serving. Using a kettle with a narrow spout, add just enough hot water to wet the grounds. Start at the center and work outward, without hitting the filter sides.
