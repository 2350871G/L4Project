          "headline":"Use a high-quality whey supplement to easily up your protein intake.",
          "description":"Whey is one of the 2 main types of protein found in milk, the other being casein. Simply measure out 1-2 full servings of your protein powder of choice using the included scoop, then dump them in with the rest of your ingredients and blend until smooth. For maximum nutritional benefit, shop around for a supplement that isn\u2019t chock-full of added sugars, maltodextrin, or other filler components. Protein concentrations vary widely between supplements, but a single scoop of whey often contains somewhere between 20 and 40 grams. Check the nutrition facts on the label of the product you're using for more exact guidelines. Since whey protein is absorbed quickly by the body, it\u2019s ideal for refueling tired muscles as part of a post-workout shake. Powdered whey supplements tend to impart a pretty distinct aftertaste. If you\u2019re looking for something less intrusive, try a more palatable mix-in like nut butter or yogurt instead.Tip: Keeping a good whey supplement on deck is one of the easiest ways to meet your daily protein quota. Most nutritionists recommend that the average adult get at least 1 gram (0.035 oz) of protein for every 3 pounds (1.4 kg) of bodyweight."

          "headline":"Whip up the perfect late-night snack with casein protein.",
          "description":"Casein, the second of the 2 major milk proteins, is a slow-absorbing type of protein. When taken during the day, it will keep you feeling full longer, helping you resist cravings. When taken before bed, it will continue to supply your body with vital protein all night long. You\u2019ll find powdered casein protein at most health food shops and supplement stores that also sell whey supplements. Consuming casein protein a few hours before bed can help prevent minor muscle breakdown, and may even increase muscular gains."

          "headline":"Select a vegan protein powder as an alternative to milk-based proteins.",
          "description":"If you prefer to stay away from animal products, look for a supplement made with soy, hemp, pea, rice, or peanut protein. All of these offer an ample amount of muscle-preserving protein per serving while still allowing you to stay true to your preferred lifestyle. While any vegan protein supplement can make a great secondary protein source, soy is the only one that\u2019s \u201ccomplete,\u201d containing all 9 essential amino acids needed to build and maintain a healthy body. One of the biggest downsides of vegan protein powders is that they often cost quite a bit more than milk-based supplements due to the added expense and difficulty of processing them."

There are almost as many kinds of nut butter as there are nuts, though, so feel free to go with a less common variety, such as cashew, hazelnut, walnut, macadamia, or pistachio. Since nut butters are full of natural oils, they make for extra smooth smoothies. Avoid nut butters with labels that list filler ingredients like added sugar, trans fats, or partially-hydrogenated oils. These tend to be closer to junk food than health food. Minimally-processed nut butters aren\u2019t just excellent sources of protein. They\u2019re also rich in mono and polyunsaturated healthy fats, which can help lower your cholesterol, boost your brain function, and reduce inflammation throughout your body."

          "description":"You might not think of seeds as being prime candidates for high-protein smoothie additives, but they are. And, like nuts, many types of seeds are naturally oily, so they blend well without leaving behind tiny shell fragments to ruin the texture of your smoothie. Flax, sunflower, sesame, and chia seeds all lend around 5 g of protein per 1 ounce (28 g) serving (about a handful), while hemp, squash, and pumpkin seeds all pack a whopping 8-10 g.Tip: When working with a particularly small or hard type of seed, like flax seeds, it may be easier to pulse them in a coffee grinder or food processor before adding them to the blender."

You can add either one to any smoothie in their dried or flaked form, or cook them first to soften them up and eliminate textural inconsistencies. In addition to containing respectable concentrations of protein, oats and quinoa also bring high levels of key vitamins and minerals like iron, magnesium, and potassium to the table."

While they\u2019re ordinarily touted for their vitamin and mineral content, a single cup (roughly 30 g) of spinach, turnip greens, kale, or spirulina contains about as much protein as an egg. Don\u2019t forget to rinse and dry raw greens thoroughly before adding them to your smoothie. If you\u2019re not a fan of earthier smoothies, combine a serving of greens with ingredients that lend bold sweet or tart notes, like bananas, mangoes, dates, grapes, cacao nibs, honey, and citrus."

A splash of milk will drive up your protein count even more while also serving as a mixing aid. Skim milk has less than half the calories of whole milk, making it a great addition to any weight loss program. It is a little thinner than full-fat milk, though, so be sure to use slightly less to avoid watering down your smoothie.

The rich yogurt will help thicken up your smoothie, giving it a delectable, ultra-creamy finish. Greek yogurt typically contains more protein per serving than other yogurt recipes. Another option you might try out if it\u2019s available to you is kefir, which is like a liquid version of yogurt that\u2019s packed with protein, vitamins, and beneficial probiotics for better gut health.

A single average-sized egg contains a whopping 6-7 grams of protein, while especially large eggs may hold as much as 12-13 g. To maximize your protein intake, be sure to use the whole egg, not just the white. This can be a great way to put that last lonesome egg that\u2019s been sitting in your refrigerator to good use.
