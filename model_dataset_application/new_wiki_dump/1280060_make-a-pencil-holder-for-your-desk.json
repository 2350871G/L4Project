The size is really up to you -- just choose one that\u2019s at least a few inches in all dimensions. A drill and a 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) drill bit (this will be wide enough so you can use your holder for pencils and most other writing utensils as well).

Use a pencil, pen, or marker to mark the spots where you\u2019d like the holes to be positioned -- you can place them in even rows, randomly, or in an arrangement like a zigzag or star shape. Whatever pattern you use, make sure to leave some space (at least 0.5 inches (1.3 cm)) between each hole."

You don\u2019t want them so deep that they\u2019ll go right through the bottom, however. Take a piece of painter\u2019s tape or other take, and wrap it around your drill bit at the depth you want the holes to be. For instance, if you want the holes to be 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep, wrap a piece of painter\u2019s tape that far from the end of the drill bit."

Keep the drill vertical so that the holes will be straight, and don\u2019t forget to stop drilling when the tape you placed on the drill bit just touches the top of the block. Repeat this step for all of the holes you marked in your block. Turn the block upside down when you are finished, and lightly tap it to remove all of the sawdust."

Stand a full-size pencil next to your tubes, and use scissors to cut the tube so that it\u2019s at least an inch or two shorter than the pencil. Cut as many tubes as you think you\u2019ll need to hold the number of pencils you have. If you want some variation in your design, cut the tubes to slightly different lengths. While you\u2019re at it, you can also designate some tubes to hold other supplies, like pens, scissors, or a ruler. If you want to keep small items (like paperclips) in any of the tubes, however, make sure to cut the tube fairly short so you\u2019ll be able to reach the items."

Hold the tubes together for a few seconds to set the glue, then add another line of glue to attach the next tube. For best results, arrange your tubes in some sort of cluster shape.

Luckily, this is quick and easy. Grab your sheet of thin cardboard. Apply glue or Mod Podge to the bottom of your tubes, then set the tube cluster on top of the cardboard. Let the glue dry. Take an X-acto knife and trace around the edges of your tube cluster. This will remove the excess cardboard and give your pencil holder a clean look."
