When you add pasta water to your pasta and sauce, it makes the sauce smoother and helps it stick to the noodles. Instead of dumping all of the pasta water down the drain, reserve some for your dish.

The water will drain out of the holes in the colander, leaving you with perfectly cooked pasta that\u2019s ready to be mixed with some sauce. Don\u2019t rinse the pasta after you drain it.
