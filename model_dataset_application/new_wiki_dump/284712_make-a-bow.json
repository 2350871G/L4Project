Make sure to bend it in half so it looks like a U. You'll also need wire-edged ribbon. Get a spool and that way you can make the bow as big as you like. Measure your ribbon. Pull about 18 inches (46 cm) of ribbon away from the spool. Hold onto the ribbon with the fingers of your left hand. Pull out more ribbon. Pull out another 12 inches of ribbon off the spool, using your right hand. Your left hand should still be holding and marking the ribbon you first pulled off. Bring the ribbon together. Your right hand should be holding and marking the ribbon that you just pulled off the spool. Bring your right hand and left hand together to make a loop in the ribbon. Hold the loop. Now that you've made a loop, transfer it to your left hand and hold it firmly in between your fingers. Pull out more ribbon. Pull out another 12 inches of ribbon off the spool, using your right hand. Your left hand should still be holding the loop you just made. Add the extra ribbon to your loop. Fold this extra ribbon over your loop and hold it together with your left hand. You should see a loop on either side of your hand holding the ribbon. The loops will look like a figure 8 or infinity symbol. Make another loop. Pull out another 12 inches of ribbon off the spool, using your right hand. Fold it over an existing loop. Keep making loops. Continue pulling out ribbon and folding it into alternating loops, so that your bow will be even. Make at least 4 loops on each side of your hand. Make your center loop. Measure out 6 more inches of ribbon and cut the end. Make the loop wrap over the top of your finger that's holding the center of the bow. Bring the ribbon under your finger so it's secure. Tighten the knot. Use your bent floral stem wire to bring it through and underneath this top center loop. Bend the stem wire into a knot and pull it to tighten. Twist the wire around several times to keep it in place. Fluff and trim the bow. Gently pull out on the wire loops to fluff them out. If you used wire-edged ribbon, the loops should hold their puffy shapes. Trim the ends of the bow. Cut chevrons or simply cut a diagonal angle at the tails. Making a Winged Bow Cut your ribbon. Using scissors, cut the ribbon to your desired length. Use caution when cutting with scissors. Cross the tails. Fold the left tail over the right tail. Make sure your ribbon isn't twisted or bunched. Knot the tails. Fold the left tail completely behind and underneath the right tail. Pull the knot. Bring the left tail up through the hole and pull the tails. You should have a smooth even knot. Trim the tails. At this point, your ribbon simply looks like tails and a knot in the center. Trim the tails close to the knot. Cut a chevron at each end or tail. The top of the chevron should be pointing towards the knot.",
