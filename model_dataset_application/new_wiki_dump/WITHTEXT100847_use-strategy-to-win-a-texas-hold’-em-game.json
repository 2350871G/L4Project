          "description":"In Texas Hold\u2019em the dealer and/or the button-position will be passed to the next player toward the left after each hand. But, if one person deals all the time, then the button-position will rotate the table over time, otherwise the dealer job passes around. Understanding where you are in relation to the dealer/button will help you develop a strategy to win Texas Hold\u2019em. The button has the strongest position because he/she will always wait to bet last on the current hand. The player who bets last will have the most information to work with as they\u2019ve seen all other players bets/actions before making a move. But, the player immediately to the right of the dealer, sometimes known as the \u201ccutoff,\u201d can potentially be in a strong position over the button as he has the ability to bet big enough to force the button into action/to bet-big or fold. Players in early betting positions are the weakest as they have the least amount of information to go on. However, there is a bit of a balancing out for the first round if you are either the big or small blind, as you have a bet already on the table."

          "description":"Narrowing the field means eliminating the other players for the hand. Some players will use a bet-big-early strategy to win Texas Hold\u2019em, and while this may work, it also means you\u2019re more likely to lose-big. Instead, try a strategy where you make smaller early bets to see some action before you try to over bet for other players to fold on the flop or turn (to tell them you drew something). If you\u2019re positioned at the top of the betting round you can make smaller bets (slow-play) and wait to see how other players react to the flop. Regardless of where you are positioned, your hand will indicate how you should proceed. Pairs are often your option and the higher the pair the better off you are. Also look to see if your cards are of the same suit because suited cards give you a hopeful chance by allowing for drawing a flush. If you do have a good hand, you can make a larger bet to force other players out, especially if you have the position to wait to see how the other players bet. For example, if other players (act weak) aren\u2019t betting very high, you can raise the pot and force some or all to fold."

          "headline":"Let other players battle it out.",
          "description":"If you are in an earlier position you do have the benefit of being able to call the minimum and then waiting to see how other players handle the betting around the table. If a player bets big after you\u2019ve called, you now know that he is either bluffing, or has a good hand. Chances are other players will make moves that indicate where the competition is going. When you are later to act in a round of betting you are at a great advantage. This is helpful against predictable/tight players who you expect to \"tell\" you a lot by always checking weak hands and raising better hands. You can play marginal hands by betting when they check before you act. You can also re-raise players who bluff too often so that you don't believe they are betting good hands."

          "description":"Sometimes you just get a weak hand in an early position. This is a long game so sometimes your strategy for winning Texas Hold\u2019em is folding-weak and waiting until you\u2019re in a strong, later position. If you\u2019ve already bet but see other players raising the pot but you don\u2019t have a good hand -- it might be best to fold your hand/not to call. This way when you\u2019re in a better position in a later hand, you\u2019ll still have those chips to work with. Try not to fold before the flop unless a player is betting extremely large and you have a bad hand like a two and six. Even though this hand doesn\u2019t look promising on its own it could create a straight, two pairs, three of a kind, or even a full house. But, if you\u2019re in an early position and have to raise your bet to stay in with an unlikely winning hand, it might be best to fold."

          "description":"If you flop a monster/\"the nuts\" (the best possible flop with your hold cards) or at least trips, just check and call any bets to induce a bluff since you seem weak, or on the bad side, you may let your opponents catch a card on the turn or river. Slow-playing works best with loose aggressive players that you hope will try to bluff when no one has bet/as if they have nothing. If you flop a full house and bet out, everyone folds and you only win a small pot. So just check and let others lead out, as you try to catch a card on 4th or 5th street. Be careful, though, that you don't slow-play and get many opponents checking to see draws. For example, if you hold T(\u2665) - T(\u2660), and the flop comes T(\u2663) - 9(\u2666) - 3(\u2663) for \"trips T's\", and you now have three or more opponents in the pot. Do not slow play your set/trips, especially if you raised pre-flop and are known to make continuation bets.

If you\u2019ve employed the other strategies here and have waited for quality hands, you can use what you know to beat your opponents. For example. The odds of getting two cards that you need on the turn or the river is less than 1%. So as soon as you have a hand you\u2019re confident you can win with, bet like you\u2019re going to win. Raise before the flop and if you hit your hand keep betting, but don\u2019t overdo it, one pair won\u2019t often win big pots, but a high pair can lead to a solid win if you can force other players out quickly. When you play aggressively, you can put your opponents onto the defensive and can force them out making it less likely for someone to make a better hand than you."

This doesn\u2019t mean immediately folding if you get dealt one of these hands, especially if you\u2019re either big or small blind and have already bet. Hands like 2-2, 5-5 or 7-7 lose most of their value after the flop unless you make a set (three of a kind) so it\u2019s better not to hold out for something down the river and just cut your losses. You don\u2019t always have to fold on a small pocket as they could lead to a winning hand, but don\u2019t let yourself get carried away just because you start with a pair. Play the pot odds. If there is a large pot, say $100 and your opponent has raised another $100 then it\u2019s usually a mistake to chase the pot hoping that you can end up with something like a flush or straight. This strategy typically has you losing more than winning. Don\u2019t always chase straight and flush draws even though it\u2019s tempting. A skilled opponent won\u2019t let you see the next card without first paying up unless he\u2019s confident he has your draw beat and is trying to win the pot as quickly as possible. While making large bets is a tactic to forcing other players to fold, sometimes a bet that\u2019s very large can be an indication that your opponent has the winning hand. Be assertive when the odds are in your favor. Remember that these strategies for winning Texas Hold\u2019em rely largely on you being patient and taking in as many small or medium pots as you can instead of a couple larger ones. If you\u2019ve employed the other strategies here and have waited for quality hands, you can use what you know to beat your opponents. For example. The odds of getting two cards that you need on the turn or the river is less than 1%. So as soon as you have a hand you\u2019re confident you can win with, bet like you\u2019re going to win. Raise before the flop and if you hit your hand keep betting, but don\u2019t overdo it, one pair won\u2019t often win big pots, but a high pair can lead to a solid win if you can force other players out quickly. When you play aggressively, you can put your opponents onto the defensive and can force them out making it less likely for someone to make a better hand than you.",
