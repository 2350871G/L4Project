Hold an asparagus spear with both hands and bend it near the woody base. Keep bending until the asparagus snaps. Repeat this for all the asparagus and discard the ends. While you could use a knife to trim the asparagus, it will be harder to locate where the woody portion ends and the tender part begins. Use asparagus that is uniform in thickness so they all saut\u00e9 evenly."

Turn the heat to medium-high and lay the asparagus in the pan when the oil shimmers. Try arranging the asparagus so about half of the tips are pointing in 1 direction while the other half are pointing the opposite direction. This will help them fit in a single layer."
