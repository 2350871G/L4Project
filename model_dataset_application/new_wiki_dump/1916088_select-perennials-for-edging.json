      "headline":"Choose perennials that can stand up to physical abuse.",
      "description":"Plants that are used to edge walkways will likely have to deal with a lot of foot traffic. Hardy, resilient perennials will therefore be a good choice. Examples of perennials that can withstand abuse from foot traffic include lilyturf (genus Liriope) and brass buttons."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Select perennials that provide thick coverage.",
      "description":"Because plants used for edging will be in a high-visibility location, and because you want them to adequately conceal the path's edge, it is a good idea to select thick-growing plants. Great examples include English ivy, thyme, Bishop's weed, and bunchberry."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Determine whether you want a compact or spreading perennial.",
      "description":"Perennials for edging can be broadly grouped into 2 sizes: compact and spreading. Compact plants are great for providing a short demarcation between a walkway and a lawn; examples of these types of plants include lavender, aster, and black mondo grass. Spreading plants will cover much more area and are great for blending your walkway into a heavily planted garden. Good spreading plants include creeping thyme, creeping rosemary, and drift roses."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Choose the color of your edging plants carefully.",
      "description":"If you want your edging to blend in with the rest of your garden, choose a plant with a complimentary color (keeping in mind that perennials will not be in bloom for very long each year). However, if you want a dramatic, contrasting color for your edging, you could select plants such as black mondo grass or heuchera plum pudding."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Edge your walkways with shrubs to add vertical interest.",
      "description":"If you want to add visual interest vertically, you can edge your walkways with tall shrubs rather than low-growing ground covers. Hardy, low-maintenance shrubs include hydrangea, potentilla, and spirea."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Consider your water and temperature constraints when selecting edging plants.",
      "description":"Another major consideration when selecting perennials for edging is climate. Many ground cover plants (like English ivy) will tolerate a very wide range of conditions, which is why they are so popular as ground covers to begin with. Still, you will want to buy plants suited for your local climate. If you live in an area with low rainfall, consider drought-tolerant perennials like rock rose, bluebeard shrub, and pachysandra."
