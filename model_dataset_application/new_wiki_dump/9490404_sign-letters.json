Plus, it reiterates that you mean what you say in your letter. You can use this for business, to write a company, or for any situation that calls for a formal tone. This can also be used for a semi-formal or informal letter. You can also write \u201csincerely yours.\u201d"

For example, don't sign off with \u201cthank you\u201d if there was nothing in the letter you were showing gratitude for. It would make sense if you were thanking someone for a gift or favor, or asking something of them. You can also write \u201cthanks,\u201d especially for a semi-formal situation."
