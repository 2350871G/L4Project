If your wood flooring is covered by wet rugs, mats, or carpeting, you\u2019ll need to remove them immediately.

Mopping and toweling may be sufficient, but if flooding is severe, you may need to use a water pump. Many hardware stores will allow you to rent equipment, such as pumps, that is too expensive to buy for a single use. If you choose to rent a pump, you can set it up in standing water and run a hose to another area, like outside, where the water can drain."

          "description":"If your house has flooded, there will likely be mud and silt trapped in the crevices and corners of your floor. Before the floors totally dry, take a non-abrasive but stiff brush, plenty of water, and a non-sudsing detergent, and thoroughly clean your floors. Cleaning while the floors are still wet will keep you from having to re-wet the floors after they\u2019re dried."

You can call a professional to measure the moisture remaining in your floors, or you can buy a moisture meter to measure it yourself. The moisture content should be within 5% of the readings of a section of wood flooring that wasn\u2019t affected by flooding. You can purchase moisture meters at most hardware stores. They can range anywhere from $40-$200 depending on the brand and the features you choose, but for the most accurate readings, make sure you get one with pins that can be inserted into the wood."

They may need a surface sanding and re-nailing, but that\u2019s much less trouble than replacing your floor. Interlocking wood floors have a higher chance of being permanently deformed due to water damage."
