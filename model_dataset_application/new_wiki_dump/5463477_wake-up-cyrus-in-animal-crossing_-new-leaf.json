      "description":"One of the quickest ways to sell 100,000 bells worth of items to Reese is by selling her identified fossils. Another great way is by catching rare bugs on the island at nighttime, and bringing them back to sell at Re-Tail. You can sell almost anything to Reese over at Re-Tail. In order to do so, enter Re-Tail and talk to Reese by pressing \u201cA.\u201d\nChoose the option \u201cI want to sell!\u201d then select the items that you wish to sell by tapping on them.

You can obtain these from rocks around your town. Gold nuggets are worth 4,000 bells each. Silver nuggets are worth 3,000 bells each. Emeralds, rubies, sapphires and amethysts are all worth 2,000 bells each."

      "headline":"Have 100 pieces of furniture in your catalog.",
      "description":"The catalog in Animal Crossing: New Leaf keeps track of how many items you have obtained at one point or another in the game. The catalog is located in the Nooklings' store T&T Mart. This prerequisite does not require that you have 100 items of furniture on your person at one time, merely that you have obtained 100 unique pieces of furniture at some point throughout the game. Therefore, if you got a kiddie couch from a villager as a reward and immediately sold it, it would be recorded in your catalog and count towards this goal. Even picking up an item from the ground and putting it down straight after will add it to your catalog. You can obtain free furniture in many different ways."

      "headline":"Have 50 pieces of clothing in your catalog.",
