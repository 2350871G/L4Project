Before moving your microwave, consult the manual for specific information. Customizing Your Kitchen Space Add an appliance garage with sliding track doors for a countertop option. An appliance garage keeps your microwave on the counter, underneath the cabinets, but has sliding doors that come down in front of your appliances when they\u2019re not in use. You can buy sliding track doors for appliance garages at most hardware stores. Be sure to look for door models that match the rest of the kitchen's cabinetry.

The space above the oven is a very convenient position for your microwave. If you have an exposed shelving area above your oven, try tucking the microwave into that nook and then installing a simple lift-up door to hide it behind.
