In the inner corner of your eye, soften the tip of your \"almond\" so that it looks curved on the inner corner. The eyelid is about a fourth of a centimeter above your eye. Follow the outline of your eye at this distance to create the eyelid. The iris of the eye is a circle, but when drawing an eye, unless your character is in shock, you will not see the whole circle. The eye can be any color that you prefer. Eyelashes are not to be too long. Try to keep it reasonably short ."

If the nose if wider, it would most likely be an African American or Native American. If the nose is more narrow, then it is most likely a Caucasian.

The upper lip is usually slightly bigger than your lower lip, but this is not always the case, again check your photo or live model for confirmation. For females, the indention of the upper lip us usually more defined that that of a male. Also, the upper lip can cause shadowing onto the lower lip depending on the lighting. This is what gives the look of separation between the lips."

In case your are new to the concept of drawing ears, let me give you a couple tips. If your are drawing a face straight on, remember that your ears lie slanted on your head. They do not stick out like a giraffe's."
