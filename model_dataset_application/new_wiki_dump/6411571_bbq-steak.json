          "description":"Preheat a charcoal or gas grill for high heat. If you can set the temperature of the grill, set it to a minimum temperature of 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius). If you are unable to set the temperature, carefully hold the back of your hand 4 inches (10 cm) from the grate. You should only be able to comfortably hold it there for one second or less once the grill is hot enough."

          "headline":"Oil the grill grate.",
          "description":"Brush the clean grill grate with enough vegetable oil to lightly coat the surface. Doing so will help prevent the meat from sticking as it cooks. Note that the grill grate must also be clean before you oil it; otherwise, the steaks may still stick to the surface. If you didn't clean the grill the last time you used it, do so now by scrubbing the grate with a heavy-duty grill brush."

          "headline":"Season the meat.",
          "description":"Lightly brush both sides of the steak with vegetable oil, then sprinkle both with salt and pepper. The steak should be room temperature before you work with it. Otherwise, the meat may cook unevenly and could become tough. Wait until you're ready to start cooking before you add any salt. Since salt can draw moisture out of the meat, letting it sit for too long can cause the steak to become dry and tough."

        {
          "headline":"Place the steak on the grill.",
          "description":"Transfer the steak to the grill, placing it over direct heat. Ideally, you should hear the meat sizzle as soon as it hits the hot grill. Keep some space in between the steaks and do not overcrowd the grill. Overcrowding can prevent the steaks from cooking evenly."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Turn once.",
          "description":"Using long-handled pincher tongs, turn the steak after 1 to 3 minutes, or once the meat easily lifts away from the grate. You should only turn the steak once as it cooks. If you turn it too often, it may not form the trademark barbecue \"crust,\" and may lose some of its juices as a result. Use tongs instead of a barbecue fork. Forks will pierce the meat and cause its juices to run out."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cook the steak until its done.",
          "description":"The remaining cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the steak and how thoroughly you want it to be cooked, but most steaks will finish within 2 to 8 more minutes. The best way to determine doneness is to check the internal temperature of the steak with a meat thermometer. Rare: 120 to 125 degrees Fahrenheit (49 to 52 degrees Celsius)\nMedium-Rare: 130 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 5 degrees Celsius)\nMedium: 140 to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (60 to 63 degrees Celsius)\nMedium-Well: 150 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit (66 to 68 degrees Celsius)\nWell-Done: 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius)\n\nThe texture of the meat can also indicate its level of doneness. Rare meat will be soft when pressed with the back of your tongs. Medium meat will be springy yet slightly firm. Well-done meat will be very firm."

        {
          "headline":"Let it rest.",
          "description":"After the steak reaches your desired level of doneness, remove it from the grill and let it rest on your cutting board for roughly 5 minutes. During this time, the juices will redistribute themselves more evenly throughout the meat. Cutting into the steak too early will cause you to lose these juices. Loosely cover the steak with foil as it rests to prevent the loss of heat."

          "headline":"Season the steaks.",
          "description":"Brush the liquid smoke over both sides of each steak, then sprinkle both sides with smoked paprika and smoked salt. Liquid smoke is an all-natural product flavored with real barbecue smoke, making it a great way to add outdoor barbecue flavor to meat cooked indoors. To further enhance the smoky barbecue flavor, use smoked paprika and smoked salt instead of standard, non-smoky alternatives. Add these spices sparingly, though, to avoid over-seasoning the meat. Also note that the steaks should be room temperature before you work with them, and you should season the steaks immediately before barbecuing them so that the salt will not have time to draw out any of the meat's inner juices."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Place the steaks on the grill.",
          "description":"Place the seasoned steaks directly on the preheated grill. Any type of electric indoor grill will work, but you'll need to alter the grilling technique slightly based on the grill style. For single-sided open grills, simply lay the steaks flat. For single-sided grills with a lid, lay the steaks flat and cover the grill with its lid. For double-sided press grills, lay the steaks on the bottom grill plate and gently close the upper grill plate on top."

Do not flip the steaks when using a double-sided press grill. Only flip the steaks once throughout the cooking process. You can also rotate the steaks by 90 degrees (1/4 turn) if you want to create cross grill marks."

Test the texture of the meat with your tongs. Rare and medium-rare steak will be very soft. Medium and medium-well steak will be springy with a little firmness. Well-done steaks are very firm. You can also check for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak:\nRare: 120 to 125 degrees Fahrenheit (49 to 52 degrees Celsius)\nMedium-Rare: 130 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 5 degrees Celsius)\nMedium: 140 to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (60 to 63 degrees Celsius)\nMedium-Well: 150 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit (66 to 68 degrees Celsius)\nWell-Done: 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius)"

The initial cooking will be done on the stove, but placing the pan in the hot oven will allow it to become nice and hot before you even add the steaks. You can use a standard cast-iron skillet for this, but for an even more authentic barbecue experience, opt for a cast-iron grill pan.
