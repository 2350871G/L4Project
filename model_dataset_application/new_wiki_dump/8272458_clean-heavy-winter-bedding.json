If the weather permits, you could also use a children\u2019s inflatable pool to clean the heavy bedding item. Once the bedding item is in the tub (or pool), jump in there with it. Gently step up and down on the comforter or duvet to loosen any grime or dust that may have collected within its folds. After doing one side of the bedding, turn it over and work your way across the other side. Continue until you feel you\u2019ve adequately stepped over the whole surface of the bedding item. Ensure your feet are clean before beginning this process. Soaking the bedding outside in a children\u2019s pool on a nice day makes the drying process easier than it would be inside, since you need only move the bedding item from the pool to the laundry line."
