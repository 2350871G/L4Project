This base of your car is also referred to as your \"chassis.\" Open the Spawn Menu of Gmod by pressing and holding the Q button. In this menu, you should see an extensive list of props that can be used in this game. Browse your available props until you find a chassis that will suit your purposes. If you spawn a prop you have decided will not work for your vehicle, you can hover your cursor over the prop you wish removed, opening the context menu by pressing C, and selecting \"Remove\" from the drop-down menu."

          "description":"You will need at least four wheels for making your car, but once you've become more comfortable with the physics behind car creation in Gmod, you may want to add more to your design. Look through your wheel choices by opening your Spawn Menu. Press Q, and from list that appears, choose the \"Tools\" option. Under the \"Construction\" heading in Tools, you should find the \"Wheel\" option. Select this to look through potential wheels you might use. Spawning causes your wheels to weld in place, either to the ground or the object the wheels have been spawned against. You may want to wait until assembling your vehicle before spawning your wheels. In the event that your wheels don't work for your situation, keep in mind you can alter the wheel model in the context menu by hovering your mouse over the part, holding C, and selecting \"Model\" from the dropdown menu."

Open your Spawn Menu by pressing Q, open \"Tools\" from the Spawn Menu, and look under the \"Construction\" heading for a list of potential thrusters. Spawning your thruster will also cause it to affix either to the ground or an adjoining prop. You may want to wait until you begin assembling your vehicle before spawning your thrusters."

These variables can be adjusted to your preference, but your torque should be about 2/3's your friction. The friction rating of your wheels will influence your car's sturdiness, and higher wheel torque will give your car more speed. Setting your friction too high may affect your car's top speed. Keep your \"Force Lift\" set to zero, or your wheel may fall off."

You can attach your thrusters by left-clicking while hovering your cursor over the part of your chassis to which you wish to attach them. You can use your thrusters to control turning by placing one on each side of your vehicle. You may have to experiment with positioning, as an improperly placed thruster might cause your vehicle to flip. After attaching your thrusters, you will need to set keys to activate these parts. Do so by hovering the part with your cursor, holding C to open the context menus, and selecting the \"Keypad\" option. Consider the following key-binds for your thrusters:\nRight thruster:\nForward: \u2192\n\nReverse: \u2190\n\n\nLeft thruster:\nForward: \u2191\n\nReverse: \u2193"
