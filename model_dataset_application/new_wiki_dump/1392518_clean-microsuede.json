Alternatively, if your furniture has a W or SW code, you can also use a solution made of water and mild soap or detergent. However, microsuede is prone to watermarking, so alcohol is recommended since it dries quickly.

In case of a spill that you didn't notice right away, deal with stains as soon as you spot them using the same cleaning process.

Tackle stubborn dirt with a soft-bristled brush. Alternatively, you can wash microsuede items in the washing machine on the delicate or hand-wash cycle.
