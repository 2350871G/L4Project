      "description":"The food designs should be cute and appealing to the eye, as well as the accompanying serving dishes. Ways to help achieve this include:\nUsing small shapes and small portions. Using cute colors. Pastels or very bright colors can be cute when properly matched. Using faces and happy expressions. Keeping the designs \"fun\". Fun motifs help to make the food \"cute\"; think such fun things as monsters with smiles, winking hearts, baby creatures with huge eyes, grinning hamsters, etc., as designs. Match the designs for size. While keeping everything small, evenly matched sizing can help create an overall cuteness."

      "headline":"Use animal designs.",
      "description":"Animal shapes are ideal kawaii food candidates as they're easy to replicate using food pieces, with many different forms. Make food appear like an animal. Many Japanese kawaii food designs turn the food into animals such as pigs, bears, sheep, cats, etc. The chefs tend to use seaweed, tofu, olives, egg, etc. to create face shapes, ears, whiskers, tails, snouts, fur, etc. Use existing animal shaped items such as chocolate, biscuits, etc., and add these onto food shapes."

      "headline":"Make kawaii bento in a box.",
      "description":"A bento box is a common target for kawaii in Japan. There are so many possibilities for making the entire lunch box look cute, to make it irresistible. As well as the animal shapes described above, some other ideas include:\nAdding animal shapes to food pieces, or decorating food with animal designs, such as using frosting. Cutting or molding food into stars, circles, hearts, flowers, and other cute shapes. You can use biscuit (cookie) cutters or chocolate moulds to make shapes. Making food appear as if it is a small landscape, such as mini trees, bushes, lakes, etc. Making tech designs, such as robots, computers, smartphones, mice, etc."
