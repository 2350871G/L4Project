A clean bald spot is better than really gross feathers. If your owl can't be washed in water, wash it with a damp washcloth. Brush the feathers frequently to maintain their cute look. You could also wash your owl in the washing machine. This is risky, however, because it could mess up your owl's feathers. So try to be very careful. You don't want your owl to have wrecked feathers! Check if your animal is washing machine friendly. You can color in the bald patch of feathers if you want to."
