For a larger card, fold your construction paper in half, one time. For a smaller but sturdier card, fold your construction paper in half, then fold it in half again.

          "description":"Sketching paper is ideal for card making because it is fairly sturdy and also absorbs color well, making it easy to decorate by drawing with colored pencils, markers, crayons or by using paint. If you have a drawing on sketch paper that you love, you can scan this drawing into your computer, then print it out on heavier paper, like cardstock. Sketching paper can be purchased at craft stores and at big-box retailers like Wal*Mart."

          "description":"Scrapbook paper is great for card making because it is usually sold in books and each book contains many different sheets, each with different patterns and designs. Scrapbook paper is thinner than some of the other paper options, so you\u2019ll want to fold your paper in half two times to construct a sturdier card. You can also cut shapes out of scrapbook paper and use them to decorate the card you\u2019re constructing. Scrapbook paper can be purchased at specialty arts and crafts stores."

          "description":"Cardstock is one of the most preferred options for creating greeting cards because it\u2019s heavy enough that it can stand on its own without toppling over. The thicker and smoother the cardstock, the more high quality your finished card will look. Score your cardstock by running a blunt piece of metal down the center of your card; this will make folding your card easier and will make your card look more professional. You can also purchase card making kits that have pre-cut cards made of cardstock. The benefit to using pre-cut cards is you\u2019ll be able to start decorating your card faster. Cardstock and card making kits can be purchased at specialty craft stores."

Instead of throwing out these scraps of paper, save them and use them as decoration for your greeting cards. Use cardstock to clean your brush in between paint colors. Cut the cardstock paint designs into squares and paste them onto your greeting card base. Use a Sharpie marker to write your message across the design (try \u201cThank You\u201d or \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d). Use the Sharpie Marker to create a scalloped edge for your design."

Place your flowers facedown in a telephone book lined with parchment paper and allow them to press for a week before removing them. Attach the flowers to your card using dry adhesive dots. Make sure your flowers are completely dry before using them in your project."

Take your card base and use the stickers to create a grid by laying them out in three rows of three stickers each. Attach the stickers and decorate the rest of the card however you please. Use a ruler to find the center of your card before attaching the stickers. Place an unusual material like a flower in the center of the grid to give the card some additional visual interest."

Create a flower out of safety pins by stringing beads onto your safety pins, then gluing the safety pins on the card base in a circular formation to create the flower\u2019s petals. Glue a button in the center of the safety pin circle to create the flower\u2019s pistil. Glue a piece of ribbon along the bottom of the card to add some more texture."

Cut the paint chips into interesting shapes and glue them onto your card for a unique design. Try cutting a green paint chip card into a triangle to make an ombre Christmas tree for the holidays. Cut small triangles out of a variety of different paint chip colors and use the triangles to create a banner to glue on your greeting card.
