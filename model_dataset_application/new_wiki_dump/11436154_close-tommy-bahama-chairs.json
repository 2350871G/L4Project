As if you\u2019re putting on a backpack, place an arm under each strap and pull the straps onto your shoulders. Make sure that the seat is close to your back as you stand and walk. This style of transportation is best if you need your hands free for other items, like bags and beach blankets. Alternatively, you can hold onto the rubber handle attached to the top of the backrest to transport the chair. Tommy Bahama chairs only weigh about 7 pounds (3,200 g), so they aren\u2019t too difficult to carry."
