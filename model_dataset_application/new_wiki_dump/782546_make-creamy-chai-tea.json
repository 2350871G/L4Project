      "description":"Steep the tea in hot water in your teacup. Depending upon your preference, add tea powder. A full spoon of powder will make a very strong tea. Half a spoon will be more balanced. Choose the kind of tea powder based on its intensity. Some powders are strong while some are not. You mostly have to make teas to find out and to be sure."

      "description":"Keep the heat low and allow it to boil slowly. When the water turns dark, add 1-2 spoonfuls of sugar."

    {
      "headline":"Add the spices.",
      "description":"Add the ginger, cloves, a small leaf of an entire star anise and cardamom to the tea. Stir well until sugar and the spices dissolve. For best results, you can add ground spices so it gets absorbed in the hot tea. The ginger also tastes best when it is not too hard and is softened. Consider breaking the clove stem and crushing its top as you add it to the tea. Pick between the spices if you would like lesser spice."

      "headline":"Add cream to the tea and mix.",
      "description":"Add cream and bring it to a boil. By the time all the ingredients boil, the water level may decrease a lot if you are making only one cup. You can choose to add a little more water or cream depending upon how you want it to taste. You can also add milk if not cream."
