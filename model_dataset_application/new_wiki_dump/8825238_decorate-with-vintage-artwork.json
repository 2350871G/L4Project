If you have a room designated for entertainment, classic movie posters would add a great touch. Frame vintage photos to protect them and make them look more expensive and polished."

Place a bouquet of real or artificial flowers in the vase or leave it empty. Set in the center to offset a rectangular work of wall art. You could also use 2 similar-looking vases on either side of the mantle to create symmetry."

After that, run a damp rag over the areas you applied the petroleum jelly. The paint will come right off. If you think the paint might contain lead, avoid removing or distressing it.

To create a sense of variety, complement curved lines with straight ones. For example, hang a circular window above a chair with a rectangular back. You can also use each quadrant of a divided window as a picture frame. Hang vintage lithographs, such as floral prints. Tack them to the wall with mounting putty or place them in small frames and hang them as you normally would. You can find mounting putty online or in your local craft store."

Create a gallery wall or collage using several empty vintage frames with unique details."

On the other hand, if you prefer a more modern approach, hang vintage enamelware. You could also paint metal cookware with bolder colors. Go with colors that are in the same family as your wall color or aim for a more dynamic look by choosing contrasting colors. Unless you use fire-rated paint, avoid cooking with painted cookware.

Use objects that have something in common\u2014color scheme, pattern, subject matter, etc. Arrange them in a manner that both shows off their variety and unifies them as a single work of art. For example, imagine you have three small vintage posters featuring forms of transportation. One depicts a car; another depicts a train; the final one depicts an airplane. Look at each poster's use of line, shape, and color. If the airplane poster has more vertical lines than the other two, hang that one in the center."

If you have a laser level or painter's tape, let that be your vertical axis. Then, start arranging your hangings on each side of the line in a mirror-image fashion. Make sure your artworks are evenly spaced. For example, let's say you have two  rectangular paintings and two smaller square paintings. You would place the two paintings immediately to either side of the vertical axis. After that, you would hang each square painting on either free side of the rectangular ones."
