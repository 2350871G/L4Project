However, that's likely to end in disaster. Instead, try taking a safety shot. A safety is where you set up the cue ball in a bad position for your opponent, or you hit your own ball into a position that blocks your opponent.

The idea is that you set up the shot in such a way that if you miss, you won't have left a chance wide open for your opponent.

It's best to avoid fouls if at all possible. Fouls include things like hitting the cue ball into a pocket (scratching), hitting the cue ball more than once, pushing the cue ball instead of hitting it, and not hitting your balls with the cue ball before hitting another player's balls. You also can't touch the cue ball with anything but the tip of the cue stick or cause any ball to bounce off the table."
