Stay away from soft peppers or spotty, diseased peppers. Instead, opt of ripe, firm jalape\u00f1os that are a vibrant green, yellow, or red. Cut the jalape\u00f1os into slices. Each slice should be about 1/4-inch (6.45-mm) thick. Use a sharp knife to make clean cuts, or use a mandolin slicer if there is one available. Throw out the stem end.

Stir the peppers into the solution to make sure that they are all moistened. Refrigerate the jalape\u00f1os. Transfer the container of lime water and jalapenos to the refrigerator and keep it there for 12 to 24 hours. Stir the peppers every few hours as they continue to soak. Drain and rinse the peppers. After they finish soaking, drain the lime water from the peppers by pouring the contents of the container through a colander. Rinse the jalape\u00f1o slices with running water. Soak the peppers in clean water. Place the peppers in a clean container and cover them with cold water. Refrigerate them as they soak for an hour to remove any additional lime. Drain the water again. Rinse, soak, and drain the peppers twice more. The process may seem excessive, but it is important to follow in order to remove all the lime and to reduce the number of seeds that get preserved. Canning the Jalape\u00f1os Boil water inside a boiling-water canner. As you prepare the jars for canning, you should get your canner ready. Fill the canner with enough water to completely submerse the jars in. Position a jar rack inside the bottom of the canner to prevent the jars from sliding around. If you do not have a boiling-water canner, you can use a large, heavy stockpot instead. Make sure you still place something at the bottom of the stockpot to prevent the jars from moving around later on, though. Combine the mustard seed and celery seed. Mix the two seasonings together evenly in a small dish. Distribute the seed mixture into the jars. Spread equal amounts of the seed mixture into each pint-size (500 ml) jar until all of the mixture has been used. Place a funnel in the top of each jar. Use a wide-mouth funnel, if available, to make it easier to pack the peppers into each jar as you work. Transfer the pepper rings into each jar. Distribute equal amounts of the peppers into each jar using a large serving spoon or measuring cup. Leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty headspace in between the peppers and the top of each jar. Boil the vinegar, canning salt, and purified water. Combine the three ingredients in a saucepan and heat them over high heat, stirring occasionally. Once the salt is dissolved and the solution has reached a boil, remove it from the heat. Ladle the brine solution over the jalapenos. Use a ladle to pour the vinegar brine into the jars, covering the peppers completely and filling in any air pockets further down inside the jar. Leave 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) empty headspace. Wipe the rims of the jars clean. If anything got onto the rims of the jars as you worked, it is important to clean it off with a clean, damp cloth. Excess seasoning or brine could actually interfere with the lids and prevent them from sealing correctly. Place the lids on the jars. Two-piece metal canning lids work best. Screw the lids onto the jars, stopping once you feel resistance. Do not tighten the lids too much, since doing so can cause damage to the jars. Process the jars in a boiling-water canner.

Use jar tongs to carefully remove the jars of jalapeno slices. Let them cool in a draft-free spot for 12 to 24 hours. Check the seals. If the center button on the lids pop up and down, the lids have not sealed and the peppers are not safe for long-term storage. If the button does not move, however, the lids have sealed correctly.
