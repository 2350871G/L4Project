  "text":" Scoring During a Round Place a card face up from your hand onto the table. Decide who gets to go first by picking a dealer. Whoever is sitting left of the dealer gets to go first. Have each player take a turn putting a card face-up on the table from their hand. You can only choose cards from your hand of 4, not from the 2 you discarded at the beginning of the round.Tip: Keep your own cards in your own pile, and don\u2019t mix them with anyone else\u2019s. You\u2019ll need their totals at the end of the game. Add the face-up card values together to keep a running total. As everyone lays down their cards, keep a running total of the amount that you have set face-up on the table. Cards with numbers on them are worth their numerical value, face cards are worth 10 points, and aces are worth 1 point.Everyone who is playing is responsible for counting the running total out loud whenever they put a card down. Avoid exceeding a running total of 31 with each card. As you count the total of the cards, your objective is to not exceed 31 total. Add your card number in your head to the current total, and if it exceeds 31, don\u2019t put it down.If you exceed 31, your opponent gets 1 point, and vice versa. Score a point if your opponent can't place a card without exceeding 31. If you or your opponent can\u2019t put down a card, say \u201cGo.\u201d The person who did not say \u201cGo\u201d gets to move their peg 1 hole on the board closer to the end.Whoever lays down the final card in the running total gets 1 extra point.

This is called a \u201cpair.\u201d If you make 3 of a kind, you get 4 points. If you make 4 of a kind, you get 12 points. Count extra points for runs. If you put down a 3 and your opponent follows with a 4, this is a 2-card run, which earns them 2 points or spaces. This is called a \u201cdouble run.\u201d If you have 3 cards in a run, like, 3, 4, and 5, it\u2019s a triple run, and 4 cards in a run is a quadruple run.Runs don\u2019t necessarily have to be in order.

The amount of points you get depends on how many cards are in the run. Score 2 extra points if the running total becomes 15. If you put down a card and it brings the running total to 15, you get to move 2 spaces on the peg board. The running total has to be exactly 15, not above or below.

Make sure the dealer goes last and that everyone checks each other\u2019s math as they go.It may be helpful to count your points out loud so that everyone can hear them. Count the starter card towards your hand as you count. At the beginning of the round, the dealer flipped over a card and left it face-up on the table. Have each player count this card like it\u2019s in their own hand to give everyone more points.This card is also called the starter card. Keep track of your scores on a notepad. Count each card combination that adds up to 15 as 2 points. If any of your cards can add up to 15, write that down as 2 points for each total of 15. Make sure you check your math, because you could lose points if you are wrong. Variation: There\u2019s a version of cribbage called \u201cMuggins\u201d where each player tallies up their points aloud. If anyone misses any points, another player shouts \u201cMuggins!\u201d and all the excess points are spread out to the other players. Add up runs and give them points based on how long they are. A run, or cards that are in numerical order, are scored based on how many cards are in each run. For example, if you have cards 5, 6, and 7, that is 3 points, or a triple run. If you have cards 2 and 3, that\u2019s 2 points, or a double run.Remember to use the starter card to make runs for extra points. Score points for pairs and multiples of the same rank. Pairs are cards that have the same number or face. For example, if you have 2 Kings, give yourself 2 points. You can get more points if there are 3 or 4 cards of the same kind. For example, if you have 4 aces, give yourself 4 points.Add the starter card to give yourself more points in each pair. Give yourself 4 points if all the cards in your hand are the same suit. If your cards are all the same suit, like hearts, spades, clubs, and diamonds, you get to add 4 points to your total.
