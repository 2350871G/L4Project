This is to keep them uniform and to avoid spelling errors, if any. Capitalise each name. You can choose to write the names in all caps for better visibility.

Drawing a Diverse Range of Greens Draw a tree on the center space of your drawing paper. Draw the top of the tree by forming large triangle shape using squiggly lines instead of three straight lines. Add also bushes of grass below the trunk of the tree. Draw three pots. Add small dots on each pot. Add daisies. Make the stems of the flowers wavy as if they're dancing with each other. To draw the flowers, draw a large circle in the middle of the stem and then surround it with smaller ovals (petals). On the left hand side of your drawing, draw three mounds of soil.
