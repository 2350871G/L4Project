If possible, open all windows and allow the sun to shine on the mattress through the window. When the sun shines on the mattress, it will naturally purge it of many germs and bacteria. This is the ideal time to wash your sheets and other bedding as necessary. A recommended washing time is weekly for sheets and pillowcases and quarterly for blankets and heavier bedding items. Wash the mattress cover monthly to quarterly, depending on how dirty it appears.

Take the mattress out of any packaging and lean it against a wall to air out. The mattress is ready to use when you don't smell any strong odors."

You need not vacuum every time you air the mattress, but a weekly or monthly vacuuming will help to remove dust and dust mites. With the mattress vacuumed, air will more easily flow over and through the mattress, and you will reduce the amount of time needed to air it."

Air the mattress outdoors as often as you have time for, but aim for once or twice a year. Get help moving it to a dry, clean spot outdoors. Make sure it is a sunny out, whether it's winter or summer."

Airing the mattress in the morning is often the preferred time because the average morning routine before going to work takes about an hour. This way, you can shower and breakfast at the same time your mattress is being aired, and replace it just before heading out the door. If you work late, you might be too tired to strip the bedding and pillows from the mattress just to let it air. Late in the evening, the only thing you\u2019ll want to do with a bed is sleep on it!"

In order to minimize or eliminate this odor, the first thing you should do after stripping off its protective plastic wrapping is to let it air. While normally mattresses should air for just an hour or two, new mattresses should air for a full 24 hours because off-gassing will occur during that entire first day."

If airing the mattress outside, you could remove the bed skirt easily, too. You might consider laundering these things since you\u2019ll be removing them from the bed anyhow, and if you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll just be strewn haphazardly about your bedroom, crowding your bedroom walking space."

Worse, they could mark it as their territory with urine or feces. In such an environment, air your mattress in doors. In an urban area, you might lack space and be obligated to air your mattress indoors as well. If you live in the suburbs, though, you\u2019ll be able to air your mattress outside. Your backyard is the best place to air the mattress out. You could also lean it against a wall on a clean porch.

For added purification, introduce plants into the bedroom. Plants purify the air naturally and will ensure the air your mattress is exposed to is as fresh as can be. If airing outside, ensure the spot you\u2019re setting the mattress on is free of puddles or wetness, and will not be exposed to dripping water or precipitation. Find a place which is clean and dry for the mattress to stand. You should try to lean the mattress against a wall or vertical beam, either on its end or on its side. In this way, the maximum amount of area possible will be exposed to the air. If airing outside, find a place where the sun can touch the mattress as well. If necessary, place a tarp between the mattress and the ground. A wet mattress will encourage mold."
