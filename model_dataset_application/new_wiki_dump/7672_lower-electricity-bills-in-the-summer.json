Unplug electronics that aren't being used, such as cell phone chargers, small appliances like toasters, or power strips that provide power for many appliances. Big-screen TVs, DVD players, digital photo frames, and other appliances use more energy than you realize. Unplugging an appliance is best because certain appliances use energy even if they are turned off. Consult with roommates or coworkers before unplugging a shared appliance."

          "description":"Circulation is important to using less air conditioning during the summer. Cool down the house early in the morning by placing a box fan in the window and opening up another window at the opposite end of the house, in addition to turning on ceiling fans. Box fans sit perfectly in most windows and help cool air come inside. Most central air conditioners will also have internal fans to help circulate the air in your house while reducing your need to use the air conditioner. Turn the fan on \u201cauto.\u201d\nUsing fans at night will help a natural breeze cool down your house; this will only work if you live in an area that drops in temperature at night. Turn a fan directly towards yourself or guests if the temperature is very hot."

If you want to invest in an energy efficient air conditioner, these are 10-15% more efficient. The smaller the difference between the outdoor and indoor temperatures, the smaller your bill.
