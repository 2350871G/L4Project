However, if your walls have grease, grime, and other problem stains, use a heavy duty cleaner, like a solution of trisodium phosphate (TSP) and water, to clean them. Let the walls dry thoroughly after cleaning them, about 30 minutes to an hour. When using TSP, make sure to wear gloves, goggles, and a mask. Also open the windows to let the air flow. Wipe your walls down with a damp rag after using TSP. You can purchase TSP online or from your local hardware store. Make sure to use TSP according to the instructions on the bottle."
