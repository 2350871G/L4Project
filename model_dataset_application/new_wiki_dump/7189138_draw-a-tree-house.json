      "description":"Depending on the tree that you've selected, there will be different ways of drawing the tree. If the tree is older, it's likely to be taller, have more branches, and have a thicker trunk. Younger trees are notably difficult to climb due to their lack of branches and thin trunks. Make sure that the tree looks like it could support the tree house! If the tree house is resting on the fork of two thin branches, anyone who climbs into it is going to go crashing to the ground."

      "description":"There are many different styles of tree houses and they can be located in different spots. What do you want your tree house to look like? Make sure that the tree house would be steady in its location. It can't be simply resting on one branch, as walking to the sides of the house would cause it to fall out of the tree. Try resting it across two thick branches or nailing it to the tree. Tree houses without roofs are commonly seen to be platforms with a fencing around them. However, these don't last very well in rainy environments, as the planks for the floor rot easily when they're wet. If the tree house has a roof, the most common type of build is simply a box with holes in it for doors and windows. However, there are different builds available. Look online for inspiration"
