If so, you can add all the ingredients to the processor before closing the lid and turning it on. If you're adding liquids, make sure you don't pass the \u201cfill\u201d line on the side of the plastic bowl.

          "description":"First, secure the lid onto the food processor. Most food processors won't run until the lid is firmly in place. Next, begin processing your food. Most food processors have a \u201cpulse\u201d button and a \u201crun\u201d button. These buttons can be used to chop, blend, or liquefy food. The \u201crun\u201d button blends things continuously. This button is usually used to create mayo, blend ingredients into a smooth soup, or create chunk-free sauces. The \u201cpulse\u201d button is usually used to chop food. The processor will only run when you're holding the button down. Press the button in one second intervals until the food is chopped the way you like it. If your processor has more than two buttons, refer to your manufacturer manual for usage tips."

If your food processor has a tube on the lid, you can add the ingredients while the processor is running. Use the plastic or metal tamper to press food into the processor. If your food processor doesn't have a tube, turn off the processor and remove the lid to add any additional ingredients."

Use a damp cloth to wipe down the electric part, removing any smears of food or liquid. Let the parts dry before reassembling the food processor. Never submerge the electric section in water, especially when it's plugged in. It will ruin the food processor and potentially electrocute you. Never handle the sharp part of the processing blades."
