          "description":"If giving up meat is your ultimate goal, think of all the smaller steps you need to take to get there. Write down goals or barriers that you'll have to get past and celebrate when you achieve them. This can give you momentum for reaching your goal. For example, you might challenge yourself to give up eating fast food within 1 week or cutting back the number of meals with meat to 3 times a week. Some gradual goals could be cutting out red meat within 2 weeks, not eating chicken within 3 weeks, and not eating pork by 1 month. Make some of your goals fun. You could challenge yourself to try 2 new vegetarian ingredients or cuisine each week, for instance."

You might be craving meat because you want a specific flavor, so try these common swaps:\nIf you're craving a filling, butter flavor, eat avocado instead of meat. Make a peanut butter sandwich instead of chicken if you're craving protein. Eat mushrooms, miso, or parmesan cheese if you're craving a savory umami flavor."

Remind yourself that you can work towards your next goal and you'll eventually be able to stop eating meat altogether.Tip: Consider telling friends and family that you're going to stop eating meat.
