  "text":" Prepare the Lavender Obtain your lavender. Try picking your lavender just before you use it so that it has the freshest possible taste. Choose blossoms that have the fullest color and pass over any that are wilted or less robust. Immerse the blooms in a bowl of cool water to remove any insects or soil.  Place the lavender between two paper towels and dab the blooms until they are dry. Alternatively, you can place the blooms in a salad spinner as long as you spin them slowly and gently. Place the lavender in a mortar and pestle and grind the flowers with the pestle until the leaves become fragrant.  Prepare the Dough Place the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl. Cream the mixture on medium speed using either a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or a handheld mixer. Add the honey and lemon juice. Continue mixing until the ingredients are incorporated. Add the flour and lemon zest to the mixing bowl. Knead the ingredients with your clean hands until a dough forms. Sprinkle flour onto a work surface.  Roll out the dough using a rolling pin until it is about 1/4\u201d thick.  Scatter the lavender flowers over the dough. Using the rolling pin, press the flowers into the dough. In essence, the dough for lavender and lemon cookies is a shortbread dough. You won\u2019t actually add the lavender until after you have rolled out the dough.
