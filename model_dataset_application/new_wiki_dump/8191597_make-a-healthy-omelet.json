For instance, even a small raw egg contains meaningful amounts of iron, phosphorus, zinc, and folate. Further, yolks also contain good vitamins A and D, as well as a bunch of choline, lutein, and zeaxanthin, all of which your body needs."

          "description":"One small whole egg contains 54 calories and 47% of your daily allotment of cholesterol, while the equivalent amount of egg whites contains only 17 calories and 0 cholesterol. If you\u2019re counting calories or watching your cholesterol intake, egg whites may be the better option. Otherwise, whole eggs may be the better option, as they contain many healthy vitamins and nutrients. For egg whites, there is variation in flavor and consistency between different brands. If you don\u2019t like the first type of egg whites you try, switch brands and try another - some cook more easily than others too. Follow the container for the equivalent amount of egg white to use in exchange for whole eggs. Usually, two of the \u201cequivalent\u201d amount will cook up to about as much as one whole egg, in terms of size. You can also make your own egg whites by removing the yolks from eggs yourself. There are several easy ways to do so at home."

          "description":"The best place to get eggs is a local farmer\u2019s market. Not only will they be fresh and flavorful, they often come from healthier hens. At the grocery store, opt for cage-free, organic eggs or egg whites. These will ensure that the hens were not fed unhealthy food that may translate into health risks for you."

It\u2019s also got a good amount of filling fiber and a bunch of magnesium, which is vital to both neurological and metabolic health. Perhaps best of all, there is no need to worry about how much you add - throw in as much as you\u2019d like. For example, make a spinach and low-fat cottage cheese omelet. Add tomatoes, and season with salt and pepper."

Add whichever color bell pepper you prefer. Aside from supporting your immune system, vitamin C can help your body burn fat and convert carbs into usable fuel. Further, it can even help your muscles grow and recover after a workout."

For instance, adding two or three ounces of a cooked vegetable can make an omelet both healthier and more filling. Especially enjoyable additions include asparagus, zucchini, mushrooms, eggplant, tomato, and avocado."

The benefit of doing so is two fold: you\u2019ll stay full for longer, and your body will lose body fat more easily. Soluble fiber also helps reduce some of your cholesterol levels, counteracting some of the cholesterol found in eggs. Add diced tomatoes, garlic powder, and cayenne for a southwest-inspired flavor profile."

The healthiest route is foregoing meat and cheese in your omelet altogether, but you can get away with using a bit of reduced fat cheese and lean meat options. For instance, make a ham and cheese omelet with two egg whites, \u00be ounce of reduced fat Swiss cheese, an ounce of extra-lean ham (about \u00bc cup, cubed), and scallions to bring out the omelet\u2019s flavor."

You can make an especially savory omelet by adding quinoa, which will add both flavor and texture normally foreign to egg-based dishes. Plus, quinoa is the grain with the most protein, and contains especially healthy unsaturated fats as well as filling fiber. Try adding a \u00bc cup of cooked quinoa with spinach, tomatoes, and kalamata olives. Season this one with cumin."

Use a tablespoon or so, and let it fully melt before adding eggs. The coconut flavor will be subtle, if you even notice it. If you do, add turmeric to season the omelet. These two lead to great flavor combination. While butter will work, it's much less healthy. If you insist on using butter, don't overdo it. Two teaspoons is plenty to grease your pan."

Even with a well-seasoned cast iron skillet, you\u2019ll want to make sure your pan is ready to resist your omelet\u2019s likely stickiness. Wait for the pan to heat up before adding the eggs. The oil should be sending up thin wisps of smoke, so that when the eggs hit, they\u2019ll sizzle. Don\u2019t cook anything in the pan beforehand.

Use a spatula to push back eggs that have set every couple seconds thereafter, with the burner on medium to medium-high. Tilt the pan to help uncooked egg get into contact with the pan, and continue as such until the egg no longer runs. Turn the heat down to low add whatever ingredients you\u2019re including.

As a rule of thumb, use a bit more pepper than salt. (This helps keep your salt amount low too.) Feel free to mix in other herbs and spices at liberty. These will offer additional flavor that add to the enjoyment and fulfillment you derive from your meal. Try basil, turmeric, dill, rosemary, thyme, and more."
