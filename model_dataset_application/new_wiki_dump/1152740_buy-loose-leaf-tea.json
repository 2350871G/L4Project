For example, Darjeeling and Assam are both teas from India, but Assam is strong and malty, whereas Darjeeling is lighter and floral. Green and oolong teas are similarly diverse."

      "description":"Buy from a company that offers affordable sample sizes, and the first time you order, instead of ordering a lot of one or two types of tea, order a bunch of samples of many different kinds of tea. You will likely discover a few favorites, and you may find some teas you care less for. This way, the next time you order you'll have a better idea of how to select the best teas to suit your taste, or the taste of others whom you are buying tea for."
