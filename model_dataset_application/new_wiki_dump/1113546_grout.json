This type of grout has been mixed with fine sand, so it's better able to fill a large joint instead of shrinking. Don't use sanded grout on joints that are narrower than \u20448 inch (3.2 mm), since the sand may take up too much of the width and weaken the overall structure. Avoid using sanded grout on polished marble or other easily scratched surfaces, as the sand may scratch or damage these surfaces. You can buy sanded grout at any home improvement store. A 25 pounds (11 kg) bag of grout compound will be enough to grout around 200 square feet (19 m) of tile space."

However, note that epoxy grout is much harder to apply because it dries very fast. Because of the difficulty involved in applying epoxy grout, it may be better to hire a professional to do it for you.

Start by pouring about \u2154 of the water you'll use into a mixing bucket, add the necessary amount of grout compound, and mix these ingredients together. Then, add the rest of the water and continue mixing until the consistency is correct. The manufacturer's instructions should tell you how to determine when your grout is at the right consistency. However, usually it is at the correct consistency when you can roughly form it into a ball. There are also many additives you can mix into your grout. These can help combat staining, prolong the life of the grout, or have other helpful benefits. Talk with your local hardware store about what is available to you."
