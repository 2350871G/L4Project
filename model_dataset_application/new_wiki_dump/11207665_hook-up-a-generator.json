You can plug your portable generator into a transfer switch to bring power to a building or you can plug appliances or devices directly into it. They\u2019re also much more affordable than other options and you can keep them in storage or in your garage until you need it. Gas-powered generators use either diesel or gasoline as fuel. Diesel-powered generators usually require fewer refills than gasoline, but can be more expensive."

          "description":"Inverter generators automatically adjust the engine\u2019s output up and down depending on how much energy is needed rather than running at full capacity at all times, like most gas-powered portable generators. But like gas-powered generators, they can be connected to a transfer switch to power a building or you can plug your appliances or devices directly into them. Inverter generators don\u2019t need to be refueled as often, produce lower emissions, and are much quieter than other generators. You can use a small inverter generator to take tailgating or camping to power your electronic devices. They generally weigh about 50\u201360 pounds (23\u201327 kg)."
