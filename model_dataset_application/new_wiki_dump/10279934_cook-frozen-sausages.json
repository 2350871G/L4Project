Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the baking pan, and then add your sausages. Move the sausages around in the oil to coat them before baking.

When you cut open your sausage, there should be no sign of pink meat and the juices should be clear in color. If you are unsure if your sausage is thoroughly cooked, return it to the oven for another 5 minutes and then test it again.. Grilling Your Sausages Preheat the grill to medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes. After your grill has been heated, turn off two of the burners to create an area of indirect heat. Place the sausages on a wire rack over the area of indirect heat. Using a rack to hold your sausages will allow for an even cook throughout by removing them from direct heat.

Cook the sausages on the grill for 15 minutes with the lid closed. Flip the sausages halfway through their cook time. This will allow for even browning on both sides of your sausages and balanced internal temperature. Use a meat thermometer to ensure that the middle temperature is at least 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). Once they have reached 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C), place the sausages over direct heat to brown the casing for 3 minutes.

Frying Your Sausages in a Pan Add the sausages to a large saucepan filling it with enough cold water to cover them. Turn the stove on to medium-high heat and allow the water to simmer.
