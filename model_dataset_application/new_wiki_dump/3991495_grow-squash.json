Plant the seeds in peat pots around 3 to 4 weeks before your planting. However, be sure to harden the seedlings so they won\u2019t shock as much when you move them outside. To harden seedlings, you slowly expose them to outdoor conditions over the week or two before you plant them outside. Move them outdoors for a short period of time each day, beginning with 1 to 2 hours and then increasing in 1 hour increments. Make sure to shield them from direct sunlight and wind."
