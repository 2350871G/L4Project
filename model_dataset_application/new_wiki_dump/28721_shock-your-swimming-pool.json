That will help get rid of the excess human waste in the pool, such as skin, oils, and urine. Even if you've just had a few friends over who have used the pool all evening, that may be a good time to shock it afterwards."

Even if you don't get a big storm, having rain for several days in a row can change your chlorine levels. Similarly, if your pool loses or gains a lot of water for any reason, it's time to shock your pool, such as if you've had a severe drought that's caused the pool to evaporate a lot of water."

However, it also doesn't last as long as most other chemicals, especially in sunlight. Always apply this type at night. This type is usually in granular form, meaning you need to dissolve it before adding it to the pool."

However, this doesn't contain calcium, thus it won't make your water harder. Sometimes, you can add this directly to your pool without diluting it. It depends on the brand. Otherwise, dilute it in water. You should also add this one at night."

Place a DPD #1 free chlorine tablet into the water in the tube. With the lid on, shake the tube until the tablet dissolves, then check the color of the water against the chart. You can find these kits online or at pool supply stores; they measure how much chlorine is in the pool. They give the value in parts per million (ppm). Some kits may use drops instead of tablets.

When the chlorine mixes like this, it's not as effective at disinfecting the water. Free chlorine is much more effective. For instance, if your total chlorine is 2.5 ppm and your free chlorine is 1.2 ppm, your combined chlorine is 2.5 - 1.2 = 1.3 ppm."

Therefore, divide the volume of your pool by 10,000 gallons (38,000 L). For instance, if your pool is 60,000 gallons (230,000 L), divide by 10,000 gallons (38,000 L) to get 6.

For instance, you may need 2 ounces (57 g) of the product to raise the pool by 1 ppm. Multiply that number by the pool volume number you found in the last step and the desired change amount. In the example, that would be 2 ounces (57 g) x 6 x 11.8 ppm = 141.6 ounces (4,010 g). Divide that number by 16 to get pounds: 141.6/16 = 8.85 pounds."

Using the same water already in the tube, add a DPD #3 total chlorine tablet. Put the lid on and shake the tube until the tablet dissolves. Compare the color to the given chart, which will give the total chlorine in ppm. Write down the total chlorine for your pool. Subtract the free chlorine from the total chlorine to find the combined chlorine. Combined chlorines are the result of chlorine mixing with body waste like skin, oil, and urine. When the chlorine mixes like this, it's not as effective at disinfecting the water. Free chlorine is much more effective. For instance, if your total chlorine is 2.5 ppm and your free chlorine is 1.2 ppm, your combined chlorine is 2.5 - 1.2 = 1.3 ppm. Multiply the combined chlorine by 10 to find the breakpoint level. The breakpoint level is when enough free chlorine is in the pool to break down the combined chlorines in your water. If you don't add enough, all the free chlorine will just convert to combined chlorines. If your combined chlorine level was 1.3, multiply that by 10 to equal 13, your breakpoint level. Figure out the desired change amount by subtracting the free chlorine level from the breakpoint level. The desired change amount tells you how much you want the water to change in ppm. That will guide how much chlorine you add to the pool. For instance, the breakpoint level in the example is 13. Subtract the free chlorine level of 1.2 from 13 to get 11.8 ppm, the desired change amount. Divide the volume of your pool by 10,000 gallons. Typically, shock chemicals give an amount it takes to change the ppm level by 1 in 10,000 gallons (38,000 L). Therefore, divide the volume of your pool by 10,000 gallons (38,000 L). For instance, if your pool is 60,000 gallons (230,000 L), divide by 10,000 gallons (38,000 L) to get 6. Always check your product for the correct amount. Multiply the pool volume by the amount of product needed to raise the chlorine level 1 ppm. Check the back of the bottle again. It will tell you how much you need of the product to raise the chlorine level by 1 ppm in 10,000 gallons (38,000 L). For instance, you may need 2 ounces (57 g) of the product to raise the pool by 1 ppm. Multiply that number by the pool volume number you found in the last step and the desired change amount. In the example, that would be 2 ounces (57 g) x 6 x 11.8 ppm = 141.6 ounces (4,010 g). Divide that number by 16 to get pounds: 141.6/16 = 8.85 pounds. Adding the Shock Put on safety goggles and gloves and turn your pool on. Also, wear long sleeves and pants that you don't mind messing up. These clothes will help protect you from the chemicals you'll be using. The pool needs to be circulating to mix the shock in. It's best to shock the pool at dusk. This will prevent the sun's UV rays from affecting the chlorine or other chemical and ensures that the majority of the chemical is available to shock the pool.
