          "description":"Buy 3 to 4 pounds (1.3 to 1.8 kg) of English-cut beef short ribs. You can ask your butcher to butterfly the short ribs or cut them yourself. If you want to do it yourself, hold the bone and use a sharp knife to cut the meat lengthwise near the bone almost through the other end. You should be able to unfold the meat. Hold the meat near the middle and cut through the meat again, so you get a 1/4-inch (6 mm) strip that unfolds from the center. Do this for the other side of the rib. If you're having trouble butterflying the ribs, you can always cut the meat completely off of the bone in 1/4 to 1/2-inch (6 to 12 mm) strips."
