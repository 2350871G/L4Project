  "text":" Preparing the Cake Start preheating the oven to 325 degrees F (160\u00b0C) as you coat your cooking pan with oil or cooking spray.  Place the beets in a saucepan and fill it with enough water to cover the beets.  Allow the water to come to a boil and cook them at a medium-high heat until they become soft when pierced with a fork.  Allow the beets to cool off the heat as you place a fine mesh sieve over a medium bowl.  Pour the water and beats into the sieve.  Reserve the beet water for later.  Put the drained beets into the food processor with a 1/4 cup of clear water.  Add the chopped mint leaves and process the mixture until it's pureed.  Put the pureed beets into a 2-cup measuring cup.  Add enough applesauce to reach the 2-cup line.  Add 2 tablespoons of the red water, along with the vanilla extract, and apple cider and use a spoon to mix them well together.  Mix the dry cake ingredients together in a medium bowl.  Add the beet mixture to the dry ingredients and stir them together until well-combined.  Pour the batter into your cake tin and smooth out the surface.  Bake the cake for 35 to 60 minutes, depending on the size of pan you use and the heat-uniformity of your oven (for an 8\u2033X 12\u2033 pan, it takes about 40 minutes).  Test the readiness of your cake by inserting a toothpick into the center; it\u2019s done when the toothpick comes out clean.
