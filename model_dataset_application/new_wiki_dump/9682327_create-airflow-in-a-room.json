Use ceiling and box fans to generate circulation. If you don't have air conditioner, purchase a box or ceiling fan for a cost-effective way to circulate air. Creating Cross Ventilation Place a window-mounted box fan facing inward. Ideally, try placing the box fan in a window that faces the wind. Install the box so that it faces inside the room and pushes cooler air into the space. To make your box fan most effective, close the window as much as possible after you place the box fan in the window. Place a second window-mounted box fan across the room facing outside. Put the second fan in a higher window if possible, as hot air rises, and set it to blow outwards. Place it in a window that's not facing the wind. Pull the window down to the top of the fan.
