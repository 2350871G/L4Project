A quick Google search will tell you when to be ready during the year that you want to see them. In 2018, the shower is expected to peak on October 9th. While astronomers are not predicting an especially spectacular display this year, the new moon on October 9th will mean better-than-average visibility during the peak of the shower."

You may need to drive a little ways out into the country to accomplish this, or you might want to seek out a national or state park if there\u2019s one near you. Aim for a place with a clear view of the north with no trees or tall buildings on the horizon. There are also a variety of websites devoted to helping you find a \u201cdark site\u201d to watch the night sky without obstruction, so check one of those out if you don\u2019t know of a good place."

You may want to look at one in advance. The meteor shower will appear to be coming from the constellation Draco the Dragon, so it may help you to know where to look for Draco. A few good free stargazing apps include Star Walk 2, SkyView Free, and Star Chart. The Dragon is located between the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper. If you\u2019re going to use an app, you\u2019ll probably want to check it before you leave home to be sure you can locate the appropriate stars. Looking at your phone a lot in the dark will make it hard for your eyes to adjust well enough to see the stars and meteors."

Depending on the weather, you will probably also want lots of warm layers and maybe a thermos of a nice, hot beverage. You may want a chair if you\u2019re not interested in lying on the ground. You\u2019ll have to tilt your head back and look straight up unless your chair reclines, so you may want to pack a beach chair. You could also consider lying in the bed of your truck or on the hood of your car. Don\u2019t bother with binoculars or a telescope.

It takes about 30 minutes for your eyes to completely adjust to the darkness after you\u2019ve been in bright light, so turn off all of your light sources as soon as you arrive. If you need to look at a light, try to do it with 1 eye closed. Don\u2019t open that eye again until you\u2019re in the darkness. The eye you closed won\u2019t have to readjust."

On October evenings, the Big Dipper will be very close to the horizon. If you are anywhere north of the latitude of Little Rock, Arkansas (35 degrees north latitude), you should be able to see it as soon as it gets dark. If you\u2019re south of that latitude, you may still be able to see some meteors, but you should use the Little Dipper as a reference point."

You can find it by looking at the bowl of the Big Dipper and tracing a line up from the 2 stars that make up the outer edge of the bowl. The North Star is the last star in the handle of the Little Dipper. The Little Dipper will be visible at any time of night anywhere north of the Tropic of Cancer (23.5 degrees north latitude). If you can\u2019t find the Big Dipper, you may still be able to find the Little Dipper by looking North and searching for the distinctive bowl and handle shape."
