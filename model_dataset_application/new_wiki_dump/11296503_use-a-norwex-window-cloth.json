Norwex makes special dryer balls that work as fabric softener for the microfiber material without damaging it in the process. Add these balls to the machine before starting a normal drying cycle at a low to moderate temperature. If the material is still damp when it comes out of the dryer, let the Window Cloth air-dry for a few hours."

Wring any excess water out of the material before leaving it to air-dry overnight. Add a tiny amount of dish soap during the rubbing process if you want your Window Cloth to be extra clean. If you use your Window Cloth in the kitchen a lot, consider draping it over the oven door, or along the top of a kitchen chair. If you\u2019d prefer to use a hook, Norwex Window Cloths also come with a hanging loop stitched into the material."
