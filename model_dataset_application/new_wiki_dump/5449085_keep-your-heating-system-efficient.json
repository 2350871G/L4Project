If you don't know where it is, call for a maintenance and have a technician show you, or a neighbor if you are not so mechanically inclined. This pays back in spades for efficiency, longevity and comfort from your furnace."

If it is an old cast iron boiler, they can go for 40 plus years, if kept up, although they are less efficient than the new high efficiency ones available today. Just bear in mind that with high efficiency comes more complex, more expensive parts to maintain and repair as they get to a few years old. Be aware that all new units are not all created equal. Some are much less reliable. Make sure whoever is installing the equipment services them also, this makes for a better installation as they know the problems that do arise with poorly installed equipment."

Although if you have an old heating system and are putting in a new furnace, the technician cannot be a miracle worker when he or she is just replacing the furnace (heart) and the arteries may not be optimum. The arteries are what get the heat out to the extremities\u2013\u2013if they were not done well originally they will still not perform better than before the heart was replaced. This to be a good analogy of how a heating system performs. If you have all the pipes and ducts replaced, then you can expect a fully functioning system, as the the whole body has been redone."
