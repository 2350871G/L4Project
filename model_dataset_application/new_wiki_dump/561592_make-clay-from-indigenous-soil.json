  "text":" Mixing a Sludge Collect some soil. You will want to collect your soil from beneath the topsoil. The topsoil is usually two to eight inches (five to twenty centimetres) deep and contains a higher concentration of contaminants. Avoiding this top layer of soil will help eliminate organic debris such as living plants, roots, and insects. The more soil you collect, the more clay you can make. Add soil to a container.
