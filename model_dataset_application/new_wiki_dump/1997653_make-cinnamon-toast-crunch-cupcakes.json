  "text":" Make the Cinnamon Cupcakes Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00baC. Line several muffin tins with cupcake liners. Alternatively, use silicone cupcake holders. In a large bowl, mix together the eggs, oil, buttermilk and vanilla, using a large spoon.  Stir the sour cream into the egg mixture with the spoon.  Add the cake mix and the cinnamon to the wet ingredients and blend all the ingredients together until they form a smooth batter.  Crush the cereal in a sealable bag with a rolling pin.  Pour 2/3 cup of the cereal crumbs into a measuring cup.  Gently stir in the crushed cereal using a spatula.  Fill the cupcake liners 3/4 full with the batter.  Bake the cupcakes for 15 to 18 minutes or until an inserted knife or toothpick in the center of the cupcake comes out clean.  Remove the cupcakes from the oven and place them on a wire rack to cool.  Making the Frosting Beat the softened cream cheese and butter with a wooden spoon until they're fluffy.  Stir in the Cinnamon Toast Crunch powder until it's mixed well into the cheese and butter mixture.  Mix in the vanilla and powdered sugar. Adjust the consistency with a little milk if it is too thick. Pipe the frosting onto the cooled cupcakes using an offset spatula.  Sprinkle a little cinnamon sugar on top of the frosting.
