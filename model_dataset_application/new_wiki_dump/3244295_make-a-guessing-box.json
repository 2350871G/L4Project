  "text":" Preparing the box Find a suitable box. This will depend partly on what you intend to keep in the box but to begin with, a shoebox with an intact lid is a good size and is what this project uses as an example. Cut a rectangle from one end of the shoebox. This will be the hole through which things are added to the box. Use a ruler and marker to mark the rectangle, then cut the shape out, leaving edges all around it still. Cut a circle from the other end of the box. Use a compass or trace around a can or similar wide round object. Leave plenty of edges around the circle still. See here for advice on cutting out the circle. Adding the fabric curtain Cut a piece of fabric the same size as the end of the shoebox. This will likely be rectangular in shape. Using the same diameter as the circle you've already cut into the box, draw a line directly in the center of the circle. Cut this line most of the way but leave the edges intact. This will form a slit through which the player places his or her hands to feel the objects. Glue or tape the rectangular piece of fabric to the inside end of the box that has the circular hole. Smooth down and make sure that the slit sits in the center of the circle. Decorate the box.

Playing the game Select someone to be the item selector. This role can change through the game, or can be given to an adult or host who doesn't mind sitting out the game. Have the selector place the chosen items into the box. The items should be kept inside a bucket/box/behind a screen etc. so that they cannot be seen in advance. Add them when the player is not yet near the box or ask the player to look away. Have the guessing player place his or her hand into the box.
