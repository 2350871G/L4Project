          "description":"Once you have an idea of what you want to grow, assign your selections to one of four categories: fruit crops, root crops, leaf crops, and legumes. Since the crops in each category deplete similar amounts of nutrients from the soil, splitting them up by type is easier than trying to determine where to place them individually. Fruit crops include those like cucumbers, peppers, and eggplant require lots of nutrients to produce their colorful, meaty fruit. Popular leafy greens like lettuce, cabbage, and spinach are heavy feeders that should follow low-nutrient crops in the garden. Root crops such as onions, turnips, carrots, and radishes can get by on fewer nutrients, and tend to be relatively low maintenance. Legumes, which include beans, peas, and all other veggies that grow in a pod, actually return nitrogen to the soil. This property makes them a good choice for trading off with more demanding crops."

Heavy feeders like corn, tomatoes, and cabbage, for example, can drain large quantities of nutrients in a single season. Light feeders, such as most root vegetables and herbs, get by on relatively low levels. Legumes are in a league of their own. They actually improve soil health by introducing essential nitrogen into the ground through a process called nitrogen fixation. Understanding of your crops' unique requirements will allow you to modify your rotation plan so that they'll have the best chance of success."

You might choose to plant your legumes in alongside fruit crops like tomatoes or squash, or alternate leafy greens with low-impact root crops. The exact placement will only become important after the first growing season, when the soil containing each crop type has been used up. For maximum nutrient retention, consider alternating between heavy feeders and light feeders. Moving a crop of melons into a plot previously devoted to a few cilantro plants will ensure that they get the sustenance they need. The traditional eight-crop rotation plan can be a great place to start if you\u2019re new to crop rotation. It calls for a eight simple crops: tomatoes, peas, cabbage, sweet corn, potatoes, squash, root crops, and beans. Each of these crops is shifted over one plot every next growing season."

Leaving a plot fallow, or unused, will give the soil a break and prepare it for the next growing season. If you don't plan on growing a certain type of crop, use the spare plot to plant more of the fruits and vegetables you like. Alternately, you can leave more than one plot empty (preferably on opposite ends of the garden) to give the soil more time to recover."
