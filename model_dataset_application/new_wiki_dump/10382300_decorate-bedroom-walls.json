          "description":"For the indecisive designers, chalkboard paint is a fun way to turn your walls into a giant chalkboard that you can decorate and erase whenever you\u2019re ready to change it up. Paint the walls with 2 coats of chalkboard paint using a roller. Once it\u2019s dry, prime it by rubbing the edge of a piece of white chalk over the entire wall. Erase the chalk and you\u2019re ready to start drawing. Chalkboard paint comes in a variety of colors, or make your own in any shade by mixing grout and latex paint. This is a great option for kids! They can doodle on the wall without causing damage to it!"

          "headline":"Paint 1 wall a bold color for an accent wall.",
          "description":"Choose a wall you want to draw attention to, like the one behind your headboard or the one across from the doorway. Keep the remaining 3 walls a neutral color, then paint your accent wall a contrasting color. For example, leave 3 walls off-white and paint 1 wall a royal purple. For an ombre effect, paint your accent wall in a deeper shade of the color on the other walls. So if your 3 walls are a pale blue, make the accent wall a deep navy. To pick a color for your accent wall, tape a paint strip in each of the colors you\u2019re considering on the wall you\u2019re going to paint. Live with them hanging there for a couple of days to get a feel for which one you prefer and how they look in different light throughout the day. Draw inspiration from items in your room to help you choose a color. For example, use the shade of pink in a painting, or go with the shade of blue of your favorite throw pillow."

          "headline":"Stencil a pattern on the wall for a wallpaper effect.",
          "description":"Tape a plastic stencil on the wall and roll over it with a roller that\u2019s no wider than the stencil, using the paint color of your choice. Remove the stencil and place it next to the area you just painted, lining it up so the pattern continues seamlessly. Repeat the stenciling process across the entire wall. Always start stenciling in the middle of the wall and then move from there. This makes sure the pattern is centered on your wall. Buy a stencil at a hardware store, paint store, or online retailer. Or make your own by tracing a design on a thin sheet of plastic and using sharp scissors or a utility knife to cut it out. Make sure to avoid busy or loud patterns. These can make it more difficult for you to fall asleep."

          "headline":"Create a serene space by painting the walls in cool colors.",
          "description":"Your bedroom should be the most relaxing room in your house, so opt for walls that are painted in a cooler shade that's stress-relieving and soothing. Blues, greens, purples, and even grays are all very calming colors. Stay away from very bright or warm colors like reds or oranges in the bedroom. These hues are energizing and will make it harder for you to fall asleep at night."

          "headline":"Choose wallpaper in a vibrant pattern, color, or sheen for a playful feel.",
          "description":"Wallpaper comes in every print from bold geometric to vintage floral to metallic abstract. No matter which you go with, adding wallpaper brightens up a room and shows off your personal style. Larger prints and saturated colors are more contemporary whereas smaller, understated patterns and neutral colors are more traditional. Installing wallpaper is a precise process. Do it yourself by following a free video or tutorial online or hire a professional to make sure it's done properly. If you like the look of wallpaper but are afraid to commit to it, try removable wallpaper. It's pricey (usually around $8 to $10 per square foot) but worth it for the ease of taking it off when you get tired of it. To add a pretty focal point, wallpaper 1 wall in your room, such as the wall behind your bed."

          "headline":"Use fabric as \u201cwallpaper\u201d if you want to be able to remove it in the future.",
          "description":"With thumb tacks or tape, hang a piece of fabric that\u2019s cut to fit your wall. Once it\u2019s in place, lift the fabric up and use a paint roller to roll liquid starch in a thin layer all over the wall. Smooth the fabric over the wall, pressing firmly so it sticks to the starch. Then roll another layer of starch, this time over top the fabric and let it dry completely. Smooth out any wrinkles before the liquid starch dries or they\u2019ll harden into the fabric and look sloppy. When you want to remove the fabric, simply dampen a sponge with warm water and run it over the fabric. It will peel right off."

          "headline":"Hang a large area rug to cover 1 wall in a whimsical way.",
          "description":"Rugs aren't just for the floor anymore. For a bohemian feel, use nails or screws to attach a large rug to a blank wall at the top where the ceiling meets the wall. Choose a rug in any pattern or color. It looks best if the rug goes all the way down to the floor so measure the height before you buy a rug. A rug with a lot of texture like shag or jute is very eye-catching and adds another dimension to the room. Depending on how heavy the rug is, use wall anchors before you attach the rug to the wall to hold the screws in place. In place of a rug, hang a fabric shower curtain or a large scarf on 1 wall of your bedroom."

          "headline":"Create a temporary pattern with strips of washi tape.",
          "description":"Washi tape is a versatile option because it comes in an assortment of colors and patterns. Peel off strips and smooth them on the wall in whatever design you'd like. Try stripes in alternating colors, chevron, diamonds, or some combination of the above. Make it as simple or as intricate and abstract as you'd like. Repeating the pattern on all 4 walls takes a lot of time and tape. Another option is to just do your pattern on 1 wall as an accent wall. Washi tape won't damage your walls when you remove it."

          "description":"Cover every inch of the wall with the material of your choice, using tape, thumb tacks, Mod Podge, or some other adhesive to hang it all. Put up scrapbook paper in fun patterns and colors, for example, or magazine pages that inspire you. Get as creative as you'd like with your placement. Lining your materials up in even rows and columns is more modern while placing things at random is more whimsical. Only doing this to 1 wall prevents it from being too overwhelming or messy-looking. Arrange the pictures like they do in art galleries. This will make the placement of the items seem more intentional and designed. Using adhesive can pull off the paint underneath whenever you remove the collage. If you want to protect the paint, use tape or thumb tacks instead."

You want your room to reflect who you are so don\u2019t choose something just because it\u2019s \u201ctrendy.\u201d Incorporate sentimental pieces as well, like a framed photo of your grandma or an African mask from your study abroad semester.

          "description":"If you are hanging something as a standalone piece (i.e. not as part of a gallery wall), a good rule of thumb is to hang it at eye level. On average, that means the center of the decor should be 57 inches (140 cm) off the ground. Use a measuring tape to measure from where the floor meets the wall and make a small mark with a pencil where the center needs to hit. Then measure where to place your nail based on how the piece is hung. This rule won\u2019t work for every space. For example, if you\u2019re hanging something above your bed, it may end up being higher than 57 inches (140 cm). Have a friend hold the piece in place while you step back to decide what height looks the best. If you\u2019re alone, cut out a piece of wrapping paper or cardboard that\u2019s the size of the item and tape it to the wall so you can judge where to nail it."

          "headline":"Put up shelves to display trinkets and double as storage.",
          "description":"Not only are shelves a great way to show off some of your favorite knick-knacks, picture frames, or books, they also provide more vertical storage space. Place decorative bins, baskets, or boxes on shelves to conceal and organize smaller items in a way that's fashionable and functional. The secret is having a variety of pieces in different shapes and sizes, with a couple of baskets or storage items mixed in. Stack 3 to 4 shelves vertically on the wall to look like a bookcase. Or, if you have a long open wall, stagger the shelves in a staircase fashion. The material of the shelves makes a difference. Natural wood shelves warm up the room while metal shelves create contrast and an industrial feel. Make sure that the shelves are well-anchored! This is especially important if you will be placing the shelves over your bed or placing heavy items on the shelves."

          "description":"A mirror adds depth and really opens up a space. Hang one across from the window to reflect more natural light, brightening up your room. Go with a large round mirror on the wall above a dresser or vanity, a square or horizontal rectangular mirror behind your headboard, or assorted smaller mirrors grouped together. Avoid placing a mirror on the wall across from your bed. Do you really want to see yourself first thing in the morning when you wake up? Hang the mirror on the back of your bedroom or closet door for a space-saving solution."

          "description":"Gather frames, mirrors, wall decor, and canvases in all different shapes and sizes to make a gallery wall. Map out where each piece will go before you hang them by tracing the shapes onto craft paper and cutting them out. Tape them to the wall and rearrange them until you're happy with the layout. Then nail the actual pieces in their selected spots. Keep your heaviest, boldest pieces either at the bottom of the arrangement or in the middle to anchor it. The more variety in pieces you have, the more visually appealing your gallery wall will be. For example, a wall that includes a starburst mirror, a large rectangular canvas, and both square and circular frames will look much better than a wall that just has a bunch of frames that are all the same size."

          "headline":"Hang a vertical garden of plants on the wall.",
          "description":"Bringing natural elements into your bedroom has a calming effect. Instead of sitting large pots on the floor, mount a variety of smaller pots on 1 wall. Arrange them however you'd like, either in a group similar to a gallery wall, in a row, or in climbing up the wall. Choose indoor plants and flowers that don't need a lot of direct sunlight like succulents or ferns. The best spot for an indoor wall garden is on the wall that receives the most sunlight throughout the day. Vines that crawl along the wall add an artsy touch."
