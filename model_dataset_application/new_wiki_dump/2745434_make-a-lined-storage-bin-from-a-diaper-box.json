  "text":" Pick Up Supplies Select your box with care. Only use heavy cardboard, undamaged boxes for this craft. Choose fabric to line the box. Consider using canvas fabric because it wears better than other types. Purchase more than enough to cover the number of boxes you plan to create. For example, 1 yard (0.9 m) should cover two diaper boxes. Assemble supportive supplies, which includes a measuring tape, white fabric pencil, spray adhesive, craft glue, scissors (and/or Exacto knife) and mat.  Pick up supplies for the box liner. You will need fabric (for example, if you are covering one diaper box you\u2019ll only need about \u00bd yard), but can use the glue and scissors from the rest of your supplies. Prepare and then Wrap the Box Cut off the flaps from the top of the empty box using either your scissors or Exacto knife.  Measure the exterior width and length of the box. You will need these measurements to create the fabric wrap. Cut out a large fabric square using the measurements. For the best fit, iron the canvas fabric before cutting the square. Place box in the center of the square and pull sides of fabric up each side to ensure you\u2019ve properly centered the box. Now isn\u2019t the time for gluing, just making sure that the box is dead center. Measure from each box corner to the corresponding fabric corner. You will be using your scissors to make a cut along that measurement so use a white pencil to mark the line (the pencil mark should not be seen once the fabric is attached to the box). Cut along the measured lines (you should have four). When you get to the end of the line cut 2 inches (5.1 cm) inward toward the box. Discard extra fabric or recycle it for another project. Spray adhesive along the long side of the box. Pull fabric up the side and smooth out. Repeat this step on the other side of the long area of the box. Add a small amount of spray adhesive to the top flap if you have overlapping fabric and fold down inside and along the sides of the box. Apply a long line of glue along the side of fabric meant for the short end of the box.  Bring short side fabric upward and glue on the box. Smooth out and assess to ensure the fabric is even. Spray the other side of the short end of the box with spray adhesive and smooth the remainder of the fabric up against the box.  Repeat by gluing and then using spray adhesive on the other side of the short end of the box.  Create the Fabric Liner Measure the bottom of the box. Place the box on top of your fabric and use your fabric pencil to trace the bottom. Add an extra inch into your measurement for best results. Cut out the rectangle box bottom from your pencil drawing and set aside.  Measure one side of the box and add about 3 to 5 inches (7.6 to 12.7 cm) to that measurement. Measure for both width and height. Transfer measurements to your fabric using the measuring tape and fabric pencil. Repeat this step until all four sides have been measured and drawn on the fabric. Cut out each box side from the fabric. Before you cut lay the fabric next to the inside of your box to make sure that you are correct with your measurements and the fabric strip will fit the space and provide some overhang. Line the backside of the fabric bottom with craft glue and glue in place. Don\u2019t over glue, but make sure you have enough so that it doesn\u2019t move. Spray the inside of one side of the box with spray adhesive and line the back of the corresponding fabric with craft glue. Don\u2019t glue the remaining three to five inches or overhang. Glue the side to the inside of the box and allow the overhang piece to lay over the top. You will glue that into place last. Repeat until all four sides are glued into place. Measure around the outside of the fabric overhang and fold under for the desired length. Make sure the overhang fabric is folded evenly all the way around and secure with craft glue. Glue the fabric underneath to itself and then use spray adhesive to join the fabric to the exterior box side. Fold.  Finished. ",
