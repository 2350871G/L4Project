Therefore, it's a good idea to at least wet, if not clean, your pet's ears, rectum, eye cavity, and neck before getting its entire body wet. To make sure you get all of the fleas, lather up your pet for at least 15 minutes before rinsing it off. As you're rinsing off your pet, part its fur so you can rinse away any dead fleas or eggs. Read the product\u2019s packaging carefully before you get started. Some shampoos require multiple applications during one bathing period. How frequently you wash your pet with flea shampoo will depend on whether or not the infestation returns, your pet\u2019s breed and age, and your vet\u2019s recommendations."

If you want to avoid using over-the-counter flea products that contain potentially irritating chemicals, apple cider vinegar can work by deterring fleas with its strong, unpleasant smell. Just mix equal parts water and apple cider vinegar in a spray bottle. Then, spray your pet with the mixture, taking care to avoid its eyes, nose, and ears. You can apply the apple cider vinegar spray whenever you notice fleas on your dog or before it goes outside."

Like apple cider vinegar, fleas don\u2019t like the smell and taste of lemon juice, so they\u2019ll be less likely to bother your pet. Just dip your pet\u2019s comb or brush in lemon juice before you brush it. You can reapply the lemon juice daily or whenever you\u2019d normally brush your pet. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to routinely apply the lemon juice to your pet since it doesn\u2019t actually kill fleas."

Products that are sold over-the-counter can be a hit or miss, so you may want to go with a prescription strength treatment suggested by your vet to suit your pet\u2019s particular needs. Make sure you follow the instructions carefully for any direct application product that you choose. Collars that contain only an IGR usually aren't strong enough to keep fleas at bay. Spot-on products are less likely to cause irritation and can be more effective over time."

Then, transfer them to the dryer on a hot setting and dry them completely. To be extra safe, you may want to repeat the washing process. Make sure you wash and dry all of your pet's bedding as well. Even if the care tags say to wash the bedding in cold water, you'll still need to use heat since it's necessary for killing fleas and their eggs. If the bedding is not salvageable, or if it's filled with dirt, dander, or flea eggs, throw it away and replace it."

          "description":"While your bedding is being washed, work your way through each room in your home with a vacuum. Go over all your floors, whether they're carpeted, tiled, or hardwood. You should also use your vacuum\u2019s attachments to reach into small corners and spaces. Before you start vacuuming, pick up any loose items on the floor so they don't get in your way. As you move from room to room, take the vacuum\u2019s bag or canister outside and empty it into a trashcan. This lowers the possibility of moving flea eggs or larvae around your home. Vacuuming also helps raise the fibers of your carpet, which makes it easier for flea treatments to penetrate deep into your floors."

To use diatomaceous earth, sprinkle it on surfaces like carpets and floors after vacuuming and washing all of your bedding. Then, leave it for at least 3 days before vacuuming up the powder. You should reapply diatomaceous earth once a week for 30 days to ensure you kill all of the fleas. Make sure you use an organic, food-grade diatomaceous earth so it doesn\u2019t contain any unnatural ingredients. You can find food-grade diatomaceous earth online or at your local garden center."

Read and follow the package\u2019s instructions carefully before, during, and after application. You\u2019ll need to remove everyone, including pets, from your home for several hours after the application or until the insecticide has fully dried. Commons IGRs are methoprene and pyriproxyfen. A common adulticide chemical is permethrin. Insecticides in aerosol form are usually the easiest to apply by hand since they let you target problem areas. In general, foggers aren\u2019t very effective since they can\u2019t be targeted and don\u2019t penetrate deep enough into flooring."

If you\u2019re using an insecticide, you may not need to reapply it after the initial application.
