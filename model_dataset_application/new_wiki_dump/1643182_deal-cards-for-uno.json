If you have 5-8 players, deal six or seven cards apiece. No matter how many players you have, make sure everyone has the same number of cards. If you have more than eight players, you may want to split into two games, or play with teams. The game does not work as well when each player only starts with four or five cards."

Power-up cards (e.g. Draw Two, Draw For, and Wild) are worth zero at this stage. Once you decide who goes first, put the drawn cards back into the deck. Reshuffle once more before you deal the cards. You can also roll a die, if you have one handy, or use any other method to do decide who goes first. Try letting the person with the next birthday go first, or the youngest person at the table. The method doesn't terribly matter as long as you all agree."
