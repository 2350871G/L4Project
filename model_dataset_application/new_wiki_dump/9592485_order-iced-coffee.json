The coffee menu is sometimes separate from the regular drinks menu, so ask an employee if you can\u2019t find it. If the menu does not have iced coffee, you can still order a regular coffee and get a cup of ice. However, iced coffee is usually made with double-strength coffee to make up for being watered down with ice, so drinking it this way will make it less strong."

          "headline":"Choose regular iced coffee if you like the taste of coffee.",
          "description":"You can always add milk and sweetener, but it will still have more of a coffee taste than an espresso drink made with milk. If you enjoy the flavor of coffee, a regular iced coffee will be a good choice. Decaf coffee is also available in most places that serve regular coffee."

        {
          "headline":"Try cold brew if you want a smoother, less acidic coffee.",
          "description":"Cold brew is made by extracting coffee from beans over several days without heating the water. It is less acidic and can have a smoother, less intense taste than regular brewed coffee over ice. Cold brew is typically found in specialty cafes that have a wide variety of coffee drinks. A simple diner or a restaurant that doesn\u2019t specialize in coffee may not offer this option."

          "description":"If you want a creamy, sweet coffee, you may want to order an iced mocha, which will contain espresso, cold milk, and syrup. A typical mocha contains chocolate syrup, but caramel or other flavors may also be available. If you are on a diet or trying to limit your calorie intake, this might not be an ideal option. Some mochas can be very high in fat."

          "description":"While you can add milk or cream to your iced coffee after ordering, an iced latte is a better choice if you want your drink to be mostly milk. A latte is typically made with 2 ounces (57 g) of espresso and enough milk to fill the rest of the cup, and a cappuccino is \u2153 espresso, \u2153 milk, and \u2153 foam. Keep in mind that an iced latte or cappuccino will not have steamed milk like a regular latte, since steaming the milk heats it up. Your barista may add milk foam, but the foam will be hot and may make your drink less cold."

This can be a good choice if you want some extra caffeine in your drink, and doesn\u2019t change the taste much since it is a small amount."
