Wait until the iron begins to steam (each iron may have a different way of telling you when your waffle is done, trust your waffle iron). Keep in mind that if you open the machine too early, your waffle will rip open and a waffle is never as enjoyable when it is not perfect."

Waffles taste good with nothing and everything, just be creative and spice things up if you don't want to leave it plain. Serve warm and fresh."
