Additionally, one digit must be able to hook underneath where the two stacks meet. It's normal to experience some discomfort in your hand when you first start to shuffle since you may be using muscles in ways you're not used to.

Watch the video for yourself in slow motion, paying close attention to the position of the chips and your hand motions. Observing your actions from the outside can give you a better perspective."
