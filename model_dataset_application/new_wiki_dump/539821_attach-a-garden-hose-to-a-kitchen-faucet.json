  "text":" Attaching the Hose Get a faucet adapter. This is a small adapter that screws onto the faucet and converts the end of the faucet into a male garden hose fitting. Unscrew the faucet tip. Take care not to drop pieces that are contained within the tip. A good idea is to put a towel in the sink to catch anything you may drop; the towel will prevent things from going down the drain. Screw on the new faucet adapter. Make sure that it forms a good seal with the faucet, but there is no need to use tools to tighten it.

Make sure the hose gasket is in place the hose has a rubber or vinyl gasket in it to prevents leaks. Make sure that the gasket is in the hose before attaching the hose to the faucet, or you will have a soggy mess on your hands. Screw on the hose. The hose screws onto the faucet adapter. Make sure it is screwed on tightly enough so that it forms a watertight seal. Re-attaching The Faucet Tip Replace the faucet tip after using the hose. Remove the hose and faucet adapter, then screw the faucet tip back on relatively tightly so that it forms a good seal. Check for leaks. The faucet may leak from the replaced faucet tip if the seal is not as good as it originally was. Add Teflon tape to the faucet.

Screw the faucet tip on over the Teflon tape. Excess tape may be visible, but this is not a problem. Trim any overhang. Cut the excess tape gently with a knife, and peel away the scraps.
