During the correct window, you might see several queen ants walking around near the entrance to their parent colony. During this period, the queen ants are testing the weather to decide on the right time to start a new colony. Since you're looking for a queen ant, you should know how to differentiate them from the other ants in the colony. At this stage, the queen ant will have wings. However, even after the stage where she pulls off her wings, you can identify her by her much larger size compared to the other ants. This will be most prominent in the thorax, which is the middle section of the ant between the head and the abdomen of the ant. You can also find additional characteristics provided at: How to Identify a Queen Ant\n\nIf you simply want a queen ant, this is the ideal time to cup one; however, if you want a queen ant in order to start your own ant colony, then you shouldn\u2019t do it yet. These still winged queen ants have not yet mated in this step of colony building."

In contrast to the fairly oriented paths of most ants, the queen ant will wander around checking cracks and crevices, changing directions, and generally resembling a lost tourist in a big city. Her erratic behavior simply means she\u2019s looking for the ideal spot to begin her new colony. Another sign that a queen ant has already mated is when she has pulled off her wings. Once she picks a general area, she will pull off her wings in order to appear less conspicuous. She will still walk around trying to find the perfect location in her chosen area, though."

If you want to transport your queen ant to make a personal ant farm, a film canister works well. Make sure she gets plenty of water by placing a damp cotton ball inside the canister as well. If you want to build an ant farm, you should also take several scoops of soil from the area where you caught the queen for her to begin nesting in once you have transported her."

Try to keep the clumps of earth as intact as possible so as not to collapse every tunnel as you dig the colony out. You also want to make sure that you cover each bucket as you will it to stop any queens from potentially escaping. If you use this method on a brand new colony where the queen has just mated and is still digging out her nest, then you won\u2019t have to dig very far, and you won\u2019t have much to sift through to find her. Telltale signs for this type of brand new colony include a very small entrance hole with a small heap of fresh dirt beside it that hasn\u2019t yet been formed into a mound."
