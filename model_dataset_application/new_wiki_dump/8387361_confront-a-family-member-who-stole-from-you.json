          "description":"Think about what you want to say to your family member. Avoid confronting them right away, especially if you\u2019re feeling too angry or hurt to stay calm. Give yourself time to cool down and consider your approach. One helpful strategy is to write your family member a letter that you don\u2019t actually intend to give them. Put the letter away for a few hours or overnight. Then come back to it and revise it. This will help you sort out your feelings and decide what to say."

          "headline":"Let your family member know how much they hurt you.",
          "description":"To understand the seriousness of their mistake, your family member needs to know what kind of emotional impact their theft had on you. Tell them how disappointed and betrayed you feel. Stay as calm as you can. Don\u2019t raise your voice or let your emotions get the better of you. Say something like, \u201cI am so disappointed that you took the money in my wallet. I never would have guessed that you would do something like that.\u201d\nThis part of the conversation will probably be uncomfortable, but it is necessary. If your family member doesn\u2019t feel remorse for what they\u2019ve done, they may try to steal from you again in the future."

Even if their excuses happen to be true, taking your things without asking is still stealing, and your family member needs to know better."

Set some consequences so that your family member won\u2019t get away with their theft, even if they refuse to cooperate with you. Your consequences should depend on the nature of the theft. Some possible consequences could include not allowing the person in your house anymore, severing your relationship with them, or going to the police."

In addition, they may choose to discipline them in their own way. You might say, \"Jared stole some money from my chest of drawers--I caught him in the act. I know he's your responsibility, so I wanted to come to you before I decided on any disciplinary actions.\""

Children and teenagers may steal to get attention or express negative emotions.

Express your concern to them and help them find an addiction treatment program in your area. If your family member is abusing drugs or alcohol, approach them with kindness and encouragement.

If you feel guilty about filing a police report, remind yourself that your family member didn\u2019t feel guilty about stealing your identity and wreaking havoc on your credit. Don\u2019t let their crime turn into your burden. If the culprit is a child or teen, avoid involving any authorities and instead take the chance to talk to this individual about what's right and wrong. You might say, \"When people leave things in their home, they expect for them to be where they left them. They feel secure at home. When you take things that don't belong to you from someone's home or any other place, you make that place feel less secure. You also jeopardize the trust you have with that person. You understand what you did was wrong, right?\""
