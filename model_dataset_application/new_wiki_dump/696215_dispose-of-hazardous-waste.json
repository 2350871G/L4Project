Look at the four characteristics of hazardous waste:\nIgnitability means that the waste can easily catch on fire. It is considered flammable if the flash point is less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Corrosive wastes are acids/bases that are capable of corroding metal containers. Reactive wastes are unstable under normal conditions. They can cause explosions, toxic fumes, gases or vapors when heated. Toxic types of wastes are potentially fatal or harmful when absorbed or ingested. They can pollute groundwater if not disposed of properly."
