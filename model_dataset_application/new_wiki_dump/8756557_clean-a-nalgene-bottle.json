Shake the bottle to create soap suds, and use a clean bottle brush or sponge to scrub as deeply into the bottle as you can reach. Rinse until no more suds remain. Using a small amount of dish soap is safe, especially if you take care rinsing the bottle, but if you are worried, you can use lemon juice instead. You may also want to wipe down the outside of the bottle with the sponge or brush."

Jonathan Tavarez\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Founder, Pro Housekeepers\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Each day, clean your Nalgene bottle by running it through the dishwasher, soaking it in warm, soapy water, or cleaning it with warm water and either lemon or baking soda. Then, if you'd like, you can disinfect the bottle by soaking it in a mild solution of bleach and water, distilled vinegar, or hydrogen peroxide for 10-15 minutes before rinsing it thoroughly."
