          "description":"A lot of errors with kitchen appliances happen because the owner failed to read the specific instructions accompanying the manual. Whenever it involves blades, high speed and the potential to explode, you owe it to yourself to read the manual. Check for the required wattage. If the wattage is different from your house wattage, get the right adapter to transform it safely. Check for specifics about the blades of your blender. Know how they work and what safety mechanisms it has, if any. Know what each part of your blender is capable of in terms of strength and possible weaknesses; the instructions will explain anything relevant to your model."

          "headline":"Know what cannot be blended.",
          "description":"There are some foods that should not be blended because they may damage the blender blades could cause injury. Foods that should never be blended include:\n\nHard spices, such as black peppercorns, nutmegs, cinnamon sticks: Pepper dust may harm your ability to breathe and sting your eyes. The other two spices, when whole, can break or damage the blades. Use a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle instead. It is okay to add ground spice to a drink or food being blended. Coffee beans: Blenders are not made to grind, which is the method required for coffee beans. Once ground, coffee can be added to the blender for milkshakes, etc. Mashed potatoes: The blender won't be able to cope with the gluggy consistency of the potatoes and will make a mess, not a mash. Rock hard frozen foods: This includes ice and hard frozen fruits, berries and vegetables, as they will damage the blades and may cause small missiles to explode out. Also, having only frozen food in the blender can cause \"cavitation\", an air pocket around the blades that prevents proper cutting. Thaw frozen foods halfway before blending and let ice cubes soften just a little first. Ginger: Fresh ginger should be chopped by hand or ground using a mortar and pestle. Boiling hot liquid: As will be explained below, never put boiling hot soup, drink, liquid into the jar. Always allow it to cool a little first (see below)."
