          "headline":"Avoid peeling your fruit.",
          "description":"If you want to maximize the benefits of eating fruit, leave the peel on (unless it's inedible) to get more fiber and antioxidants than you would if you discarded the rind or peel before you ate it. Colorful skins often have the most concentrated amounts of nutrients in the fruit, meaning sometimes the peel is more healthy for you than the fruit itself. The antioxidants in apple peels may help prevent cancer. Apple peels also are a good source of pectin, a type of fiber that helps control blood sugar and can decrease your cholesterol."

          "headline":"Wash with water.",
          "description":"You should always wash your fruit before you eat it, especially if you're planning on eating the peel. However, it isn't necessary to use soap or special fruit washes to do it \u2014 rinsing under lukewarm water is sufficient. Plain water typically is enough to remove any dirt on the skin, as well as any pesticide residues that may be present. Some fruits, such as apples and tomatoes, have waxier skins. The wax is harmless and you don't need to worry about scrubbing it off before you eat."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Fully chew your food to release nutrients.",
          "description":"Chewing your fruits break down rigid plant cell walls, opening up the nutrients for your body and allowing you to absorb more nutrients. Cutting and mashing fruits has the same effect, but make sure you use a sharp knife and eat them soon after. A dull knife may lead to electrolyte leakage, and you risk loss of flavor, texture, and nutrients if you cute the fruit and don't eat it right away."

        {
          "headline":"Have fruit first thing in the morning.",
          "description":"To maximize the benefits of eating fruit, eat it for breakfast. Eating fruit on an empty stomach is a great way to get nutrients and fiber to start your day. For example, you might include blueberries in a bowl of oatmeal, or slice up some strawberries or bananas on top of your cold cereal. A fruit smoothie can be a faster option if you don't have a lot of time in the morning to sit down and eat breakfast. If you want a bagel or toast, you can spread fruit on top. However, you should check the labels of any fruit spread carefully and make sure there isn't any added sugar."

          "headline":"Pair fruit with meat.",
          "description":"Your body better absorbs iron (from meat and non-meat sources alike) when it is consumed along with vitamin C, which both helps release the mineral and blocks other compounds in food that inhibit iron absorption. Using citrus fruits to glaze meat is a great way to tenderize your meat and help you absorb the iron. Examples include lemon or orange chicken and orange glazed pork chops."

          "headline":"Note the best way to eat fruit.",

          "description":"The natural sugar in fruit is better for you than having a sugary dessert, so you may want to try having a piece of fruit after your main meal instead of a piece of cake or pie. You also can include fruit in side dishes, or use fruit spreads for dipping. Citrus fruits work well as glazes, or in salad dressings. Many fruits, such as apples and pears, work well mixed in stir fries with meat and vegetables. Don't forget that some foods you may consider vegetables, such as tomatoes, peppers, and avocados, are actually fruits."

        {
          "headline":"Keep fruit handy.",
          "description":"If you keep the fruits you buy out in the open where you can see them, you'll be more likely to simply grab a piece of fruit when you're hungry rather than hunting through the fridge or pantry for something else. Since most fruit should be stored at room temperature anyway, it makes more sense to have a bowl on the kitchen counter rather than hiding it away. Use a larger bowl and keep a variety of different fruits available, so you can pick something that suits your taste and the time you have to eat. Check the bowl regularly to make sure the fruit isn't going bad."

          "headline":"Eat fruit before or during exercise.",
          "description":"You may have seen athletes eating fruit on the sidelines of a game, or before practice. Fruit contains healthy carbohydrates that are easy to digest, so you won't feel weighed down while exercising. Bananas also are rich in potassium, a nutrient that can help prevent muscle cramps when exercising. An apple or a banana 10 minutes or so before exercising will give you the fuel your body needs for maximum performance."

          "headline":"Have dried fruit around for snacking.",
          "description":"While fresh, raw fruit is the best way to eat fruit if you want to maximize the nutritional benefits, dried fruit can be just as nutritious. Include dried fruit in trail mixes or energy bars. Dried fruit also can be a good option if fresh fruit isn't available in your location year-round. Ideally, you want the fruit you eat to be in season, and dried fruit can work well during the winter months. When snacking on dried fruit, keep serving sizes in mind. Only a few pieces of dried fruit can equal a recommended serving of fruit, even though the pieces are so small."

          "headline":"Bake fruit.",
          "description":"Though heating most fruits can decrease their nutritional value, if you're trying to increase the amount of fruit in your diet, baking may be an enticing way to do so. Cut up fruits like peaches, nectarines, and apricots and place them in a pan. Cover the pan with foil and bake at 350\u00b0F (176.7\u00b0C) for 45 minutes, or until the fruit is soft and syrupy. Add 1/2 cup of the baked fruit to plain oatmeal, plain yogurt, or any other plain foods that you want to naturally sweeten."

When trying to consume a variety of fruits, try to buy those with different colored peels or rinds to maximize the benefits. Red fruits, such as tomatoes and cherries, are high in vitamins A and C.\nOrange fruits, such as oranges and peaches, provide you with a healthy boost of vitamin A, potassium, iron, and zinc. Blue or purple fruits, such as blueberries and eggplant, provide antioxidants as well as Vitamin C."

Additionally, commercial fruit juices often come with added sugar or other preservatives. Juice can be a good source of many vitamins as well, but you shouldn't use it as a substitute for eating whole fruits. Drink no more than 4 ounces per day.

However, make sure they're away from direct sunlight. The exception to the direct sunlight rule is if you are trying to ripen the fruit. For example, putting tomatoes in the windowsill will make them turn red if they were picked too soon. If you cut your fruit ahead of time, store it in an airtight container with a squeeze of lemon juice to keep it from going bad. Avoid putting any fruit, including tomatoes, in the refrigerator.

While your local grocery store may have all kinds of fruit available year-round, these are grown on industrial farms out of season, and aren't as nutritious as those grown seasonally. Your local farmer's market is a good source of fresh fruits in season. You also might try specialty grocery stores such as organic grocery stores. While it isn't necessary that all the fruit you eat be grown locally (and in some areas this may be impossible), locally grown fruit typically is more nutritious because it wasn't picked early and shipped long distances. Once fruit is picked, it is separated from its nutrient source and can't gain any more nutrients."
