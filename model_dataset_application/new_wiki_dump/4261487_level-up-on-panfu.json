      "description":"These are the most recommended tips for leveling up. You can make lots of money too, provided what mini-game you play. By clicking on your high score section of your player card, you get access to most games on Panfu. The best one for having fun is Cloud Number Nine, and the best money-making one is Crazy Numbers."

      "headline":"Walk your pet(s).",
      "description":"You can buy a pet straight from joining the game! Go to the Pokopet Barn to buy a Marieta ladybug and walk your pet all around the island for the cheapest way to do it. Of course, Bollys are the best. The more expensive your pet is, the higher the level percentage!"

      "headline":"Add many friends.",
      "description":"This will not only give you a higher level percentage, but it will look good on your player card too. After all, a VIP must have over 400 'friends' to let alone be considered a cool kid."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Do all quests.",
      "description":"These really do maximize your level, along with complete achievements. From doing one quest alone - even the weekly ones - you can go up by 4 levels. It's best to do the shortest ones first: Spies in Bitterland; Penny and Lenny and the Chronicler. Then you can go on to do My Son is a Pirate, The Lost Wooby King and others."
