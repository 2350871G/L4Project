Reduce the ability of wildfire to put you and your belongings at risk by removing any flammable plants that is within 30ft of the exterior of your home and any outlying buildings. Remove dry grass, brush piles, and any bushes next to your home. Cut down any vines that grow on any structures on your property. Keep your roof, gutters, and decks free of debris. Remove and do not use mulch next to any structures on your property. Remove pine, eucalyptus, juniper, and fir in particular, as these are especially flammable types of trees. If you live in on a hill, extend this protected zone to 100ft on the downhill side of your home. Keep any remaining vegetation within 200ft of your home thin and dispersed. Remove underbrush beneath any trees or bushes."
