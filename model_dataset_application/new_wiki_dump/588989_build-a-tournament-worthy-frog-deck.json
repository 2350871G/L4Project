          "description":"There are multiple types of Frog decks out there; some are more successful than others. Here is a list of Frog Deck types for you to consider:\nDES Frog \u2013  When you have 3 \u201cDES Frog\u201d on the field you can use the spell card \u201cDES Croaking\u201d to destroy all cards your opponent controls on their side of the field. Weenie Frog  \u2013 By using the field spell \u201cWetlands\u201d you can give most frogs a 1200 atk bonus. This is perfect when using cards like Unifrog, whose boosted 1600 ATK can attack directly, or Submarine Frog, whose boosted 2400 ATK deals damage when attacking defense position monsters. Stall Frog \u2013 This deck is similar to the Weenie Frog deck, but takes a more conservative approach by using cards like Level Limit \u2013 Area B, and Gravity Bind, and even Messenger of Peace to make it harder for the opponent to attack. A good way to research card effects and rulings is to visit the website www.netrep.net . This website is a widely used, and well known card search database that helps you to identify potentially helpful cards. By doing a search for Frog in the Keywords tab, under \u201cName Contains\u201d you can look up your frog monsters. By doing a search for Frog in the \u201cText Contains\u201d box you can find many cards that will be able to help your frogs in a way. Also, keep in mind that there are a few more Frog cards that have been released recently that have not yet been uploaded to the Netrep Database, that are essential to any Frog Deck."

You can only special summon as many DES Frogs as you have TADPOLE in your graveyard, however. DES Croaking \u2013 When you have 3 DES Frog on the field, you can use this card to destroy all cards your opponent has on the field. You can also use Dupe Frog to help pull this card off, because it\u2019s name is treated as DES Frog when it\u2019s on the field (Face up). Beelze Frog \u2013 It misses the requirements of Wetlands, but it can gain 300 atk for each TADPOLE in the graveyard. This effect turns it into 2400 at max. Unifrog \u2013 It can attack directly, and if you have another frog on the field that is not named Unifrog when it deals battle damage this way, you can destroy an opposing spell or trap card. Poison Draw Frog \u2013 Most people skip this card entirely, but it combos well with cards like Torrential Tribute, Needle Ceiling, and Froggy Force field. Flip Flop Frog \u2013 This card has the ability to return any monster card on the field to the opponent\u2019s hand, up to the amount of frogs you control. So if the opponent attacks it while face down, and you have other frog monsters on the field, its effect will still activate. You can also use his effect to flip itself face down. D.3.S.

This is beneficial, because if you are using Wetlands, you can allow your Unifrog to attack directly each turn without a big fear of anything coming at you afterwards, and then when you draw Terraforming or Wetlands, you can drop Messenger of Peace and boost up your monsters.
