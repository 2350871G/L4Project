          "description":"Bells are the main currency of the game series, but you start out the game with no bells at all. Since you need bells to buy your primary tool for this venture, it\u2019s going to be a bit of a problem. Thankfully, there are many ways to make bells: the player can sell items and fruit, do favors for villagers, or even shake trees for money. At the very start though, shaking trees down for fruit and bells is the quickest way to get bells. Simply walk up to the tree and press A to shake it down, then press B (Y in New Leaf) to gather whatever falls out. In Wild World and New Leaf, you can also tap the tree with your stylus then tap the items that fall out. Bells dropped from trees appear as items and take up space in the inventory. You can immediately drop the bells into your wallet (the part of the screen that says how many bells you have) by accessing your inventory (Y on the original game and Wild World, - on City Folk, and X on New Leaf), selecting a bell coin or sack with A, then dropping the held bell coin or sack onto that portion of the screen by pressing A again. You can also stack the bells by scrolling to another bell coin or sack with the D-pad or stylus, then dropping it onto that one. Trees come in many shapes and sizes, and bells and items drop from them regardless. However, only certain trees bear fruit, and they can be distinguished by a lighter leaf color and the presence of three pieces of fruit when they bear fruit. Fruit grow back every three days. Sometimes, trees also drop furniture and other items, which can be worth quite a bit if you decide to sell it. These will be seen as a leaf when they drop from the tree. Sometimes, if you shake down trees, beehives fall down and sting your player, giving them a swollen eye and an unhappy look. This change is purely aesthetic though, and can be removed by saving and quitting the game or by buying medicine from the town store. If you talk to your local residents and they see you have been tung by bees they may give you some medicine for free."

The town store is placed randomly in every generated town in every game but New Leaf, where it can be found in the Main Street.

Shovels and other tools are stocked randomly by the store, and the store inventory changes every day, so you might have to wait a few days before you can buy one. Since this game is real-time, you may have to literally wait a few real days. You can also \"cheat\" and skip ahead days when you start the game. If you\u2019re short on money, selling excess items will help you gain enough. Simply talk to Tom Nook (or Timmy/Tommy in New Leaf) and he will ask you what you want to do.
