          "headline":"Use tape.",
          "description":"Flatten a section of sticky tape against the furniture, let it sit for a few moments, and peel it away to remove stubborn dog hairs. Use broad sections of tape to make the process go more quickly. Duct tape and masking tape are good choices. You may have to do this many times to get all the hair off. Consider making yourself a makeshift lint roller using tape, preferably masking or duct tape. Rip off a generous piece of tape and put it around your hand so that the sticky side is facing out. Then pat the furniture where the hair is so that the hair comes off with the tape. You may have use several pieces of tape depending on how much hair there is. Be careful using duct tape (and other especially strong types of tape) on furniture that is coated in paint or another thin veneer. If you do use duct tape, don't leave it on for more than a few seconds. Strong adhesives might peel away paint from your furniture."

You can also try a damp sponge mop to remove pet hair from your carpets. Again, wipe in one direction only, and the hair will pile up and can be easily picked up by hand."

          "description":"Use the detachable hose of a vacuum-cleaner, use a small handheld vacuum, or lift a vacuum onto the surface of a couch or chair. Depending on the type of furniture, vacuuming may or may not work. To make it easier to vacuum your furniture, use a window squeegee to collect most of the fur in one spot. Simply run the squeegee over the furniture in the same way you would a window. Push all of the fur into one spot on the couch, then vacuum it up. If there is a very large amount of fur, don't vacuum it. This may clog up the vacuum or even damage it. Consider using a shampoo vacuum cleaner for fabrics. Make sure that your pet shampoo product is safe to use on furniture. In the future, consider brushing your dog more frequently or covering your dog's favorite furniture with blankets in order to prevent excessive shedding."

Dog hair is hard to clean out from between brush bristles, so do not use a toothbrush that you plan to use for anything else. For an easier option, look for a fur removal brush, which is larger than a toothbrush. It's specially designed to collect loose fur. You can find a fur removal brush at your local pet store or online."

          "description":"Wear a pair of disposable rubber gloves, and dampen them with water so the hair will stick. Run your hand over the surface to attract hair. Simply rinse off the glove when it\u2019s covered with hair, and repeat as needed. If you don't have rubber gloves handy, try a slightly wet sponge instead. This method doesn\u2019t use up lots of tape needlessly. As another option, use a pet grooming or deshedding glove, if you have one. These gloves are very effective for collecting fur. You can also spray a mix of water and fabric softener onto your upholstered furniture, then wipe the hair off. To remove pet hair from wooden furniture, use a soft cloth and furniture polish or anti-static dusting spray. The spray will eliminate the electric charge, making removal easier and lessening the likelihood that the hair will re-stick."

However, this method is often viewed as pointless or inconvenient due to noise, discomfort, and opacity of the plastic. You may also consider spreading out an old towel or blanket where your dog likes to lay. You can wash the towel whenever you like, and you can put it away when guests come to visit.

Brushing your dog about two days a week dramatically cuts down on the amount of fur tumbleweeds rolling through your living room. Give your dog a haircut once a month. It may stop shedding so much fur if you take control of the process. Give your dog a bath once or twice a month, or as frequently as you like. After the bath, let it stay outside for about an hour to dry off. Consider putting a stocking or thin sock over the vacuum hose, and then vacuuming your dog. You may not be able to get him or her to stand still."

Scold your dog when it climbs on the furniture, and make it clear that it's wrong. If you are firm and persistent, you can retrain your dog and keep hair off of your furniture altogether. Bear in mind that if your dog sheds a lot, you may still need to vacuum frequently to keep dog hair off of the floor."
