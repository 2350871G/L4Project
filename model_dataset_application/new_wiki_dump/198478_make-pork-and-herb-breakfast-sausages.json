They commonly clamp to a table top, to free the user's hands up for other parts of the process. Usually can be completely disassembled for cleaning and blade replacement. Stand-alone power grinders. These an electrically operated units which are plugged in to the outlet, and do the work for you. Mixer attachment grinders. These are grinders which attach to the power head of large kitchen mixers like Hobart and KitchenAid products. They are very similar to hand type grinders, with a coupling to connect to the mixer, rather than a crank handle."
