Spray a stain remover, like Shout, OxiClean, or your other preferred brand, onto the stained area and let it sit for about 30 minutes. After the solution has soaked into the stain, you can put it in the washer and run it through the cycle as normal."

Then, run the stained area under a stream of cold water to remove as much of the blood as possible. The salt works to pull out the blood while the cold water loosens it from the fabric. Never use warm water to remove blood stains, as this sets the stain and it will be impossible to remove."
