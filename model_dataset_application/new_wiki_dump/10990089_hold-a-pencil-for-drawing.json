          "description":"Curl your hand loosely and slip the shaft of the pencil into the space where your first two fingers meet. More specifically, the pencil should rest between the pad of your forefinger and the inside edge of your middle finger. Make sure the tip of the pencil is pointed downwards. In a standard tripod grip, the tip should extend roughly 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) below your hand. Drawing demands quite a bit of stability and precision. For this reason, it\u2019s best to use your dominant hand.Tip: You can also \u201cchoke up\u201d on the pencil and hold it closer to the tip if it\u2019s more comfortable for you."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Brace the opposite side of the pencil with your thumb.",
          "description":"Place the tip of your thumb at the midpoint between the tips of your fore and middle fingers, making sure that only the first knuckle of each finger is making contact with the pencil. Apply enough pressure to steady the pencil, but avoid squeezing it. Since this is the same hand position that most people use when first learning to write, the tripod grip is also sometimes referred to as the \u201cwriting\u201d grip. Squeezing the pencil too tightly actually makes it harder to control, and can cause your lines to come out jagged and shaky."

          "headline":"Lift your wrist off of your drawing surface.",
          "description":"Rather than using your wrist to anchor your hand the way you would when writing, allow it to hover just above the paper. Not only will elevating your wrist help you form straighter, more fluid lines, it will also prevent you from dragging your forearm or the edge of your hand over your pencil marks and smearing them. If you leave your wrist on the drawing surface, you\u2019re more likely to curve your lines involuntarily as you run out of room to maneuver the pencil. By simply picking up your wrist, you can avoid this common problem. The only time it\u2019s useful to let your wrist remain on your drawing surface is when you\u2019re filling in especially small areas that don\u2019t require you to move the tip of the pencil more than about 1 inch (2.5 cm)."

        {
          "headline":"Use both your wrist and forearm to draw.",
          "description":"Once it\u2019s time to put pencil to paper, get your entire lower arm involved. Move the pencil with smooth, precise strokes, starting from the elbow. Remember to keep your wrist poised above your work surface at all times. As an alternative technique, try letting the first knuckle of your pinky finger glide along the paper as you draw. This will force you to keep your wrist up while also guiding and adding stability to your movements. A basic tripod grip is best suited for making short lines, small, intricate shapes, and other fine details."

You can also drape them lightly around the shaft if you prefer a slightly more secure grip. Another option is to leave your middle, ring, and pinky fingers completely free if you feel like they\u2019re going to get in the way. If you choose to wrap your fingers, be careful not to close your hand enough to press the shaft of the pencil into your palm.

An underhand grip is ideal for tracing long, light lines and contours that span much of the paper.Warning: Don\u2019t bear down too hard.

An underhand grip is usually most comfortable if you\u2019re drawing on an easel, elevated desk, or similar upright surface. When drawing on ordinary desktop, table, or other flat surface, an overhand grip may feel more natural. Keep in mind that you\u2019re not locked into a single technique. You can switch back and forth from underhand to overhand as often as you like based on what feels good and creates the desired effect for your drawing."

Just hold the pencil against the paper at a near-parallel angle and move it back and forth in short strokes. Start with light pressure to add a sense of texture to blank spaces and increase the pressure or go over the same area multiple times to create gradually deepening shadows."

The major advantage of a brush grip is that it enables longer, lighter, easier strokes, bridging the gap between a controlled tripod grip and looser underhand and overhand grip.

An inverted grip can come in handy when you\u2019re working on an especially detailed drawing and need to be able to watch what you\u2019re doing carefully. Because the inverted grip doesn\u2019t offer the precision of a tripod grip or the consistency of an underhand or overhand group, it\u2019s best to only use it on occasion."
