          "description":"If the vinegar dip didn\u2019t help clean your foggy plastic cups, sprinkle them with a handful of baking soda. Alternately, apply a dusting of baking soda to a damp sponge and scrub the cups. The baking soda and vinegar will react, dissolving the film that causes the plastic to appear foggy."

          "headline":"Use a vinegar and water mixture.",
          "description":"Combine white vinegar and water in equal parts. For instance, if you have a large load of foggy plastic, you might fill your sink with one liter of vinegar and one liter of water. Place your foggy plastic items in the water, and let them soak for one hour. Scrub the plastic items with a damp rag until they become clear. Rinse the no longer foggy plastic in the sink under warm water. Dry with a soft cloth."

          "headline":"Use a baking soda paste.",
          "description":"Instead of using baking soda and vinegar, mix equal amounts of water and baking soda to form a paste. For instance, you might mix one tablespoon of baking soda with one tablespoon of water. Dab a paper towel into the baking soda paste. Apply the paste to a small area of the cloudy plastic using a steady circular motion. As the paste removes the cloudiness from the inside of the blender or cup you\u2019re cleaning, you will see the paper towel darken with grime."

          "headline":"Try a lemon juice blend.",
          "description":"Combine the juice of one lemon and two tablespoons of baking soda. Fill your foggy plastic cup or blender up the rest of the way with water. If you\u2019re cleaning a foggy plastic blender, run the blender on high for a few seconds, then turn it off and remove the blade (if possible). With your cup or blender bottle still filled with the lemon juice mix, scrub the inside of it with a non-abrasive sponge or microfiber cloth. Pour the juice out when the fogginess has been corrected."
