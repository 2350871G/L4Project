Be careful to lightly dab it, soaking up the liquid rather than pressing it deeper into the suede. Once you think you\u2019ve blotted up as much as you can, allow it to air dry. You can try other methods once it\u2019s no longer wet."

Aside from cleaning up mishaps, a suede brush can be used regularly to help maintain the look of your suede clothing and accessories, so it\u2019s a smart purchase. Before you do anything, you\u2019ll need to brush the stain thoroughly with a suede brush. You\u2019ll be removing the top, outer layer of dirt first. Brush in one direction as you remove these bigger particles. Alternatively, you could use a nail brush, toothbrush, or a soft scrub brush, although a suede brush is best. Once you\u2019ve gotten the surface dirt off, you\u2019ll need to scrub with a bit more force. You can also start scrubbing in both directions to tackle the deeper, ground-in stains. Along with removing dirt, brushing the area of the stain will help you reach the deeper stains with your next methods."

          "description":"You can find an eraser specifically made for suede, but a large pencil eraser will also work. Use a white eraser to clean your suede, because you risk staining your suede with a colored eraser. Don\u2019t begin this step until you\u2019re confident you\u2019ve brushed out any dirt or dried pieces with the suede brush. Lightly begin to rub the stain with the eraser. After a little bit of rubbing, you should see the stain start to lift. Continue working the eraser on the suede until the stain has been removed. You could use fine-grain sandpaper as an alternative to an eraser, if desired. A piece of stale bread will even work in a pinch! Rub it over the stain until it begins to crumble."

To get your purse looking as good as new, rub your suede brush all over the surface. This will \u201cre-fluff\u201d the suede, and no one will know you ever had a stain!"

          "headline":"Test the vinegar or rubbing alcohol on a small, hidden part of the purse.",
          "description":"Only try this method if using an eraser didn\u2019t work. It's important to do a test run before applying the liquid all over the stain, just in case it reacts badly with the particular suede you are working with. Dab a bit of the liquid onto the spot you've chosen, and allow it to dry. Make sure that it doesn't leave any unsightly marks. Examples of unnoticeable spots on your purse might be the underside of the strap, or the bottom of the purse. While vinegar and rubbing alcohol both work well, they work best on different types of stains. For example, white vinegar works well on environmental stains like salt, dirt, and even food. Rubbing alcohol works best on the more \"intense\" stains, like ink."

          "description":"Once you know the suede doesn't have a terrible reaction to the liquid, pour it onto a white washcloth. It\u2019s important to use a white cloth to avoid any color transfer from a colored one. While water stains suede, rubbing alcohol and white vinegar do not. You shouldn't rub violently, but rather press the cloth into the stain so that you are sure the liquid is soaking into it fully. Once you\u2019ve thoroughly covered the surface of the stain with either rubbing alcohol or white vinegar, let it air dry. You really won\u2019t know how well it worked until it\u2019s fully dry. The vinegar can leave an odor on the suede, but that will dissipate after a bit of time."
