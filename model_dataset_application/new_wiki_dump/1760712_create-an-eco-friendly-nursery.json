Look for fabrics that were made using natural dyes as well; doing so will protect your baby from harmful chemicals and allergens that can irritate baby\u2019s skin. If you have chosen a traditional crib mattress, be sure that you use an organic mattress pad and sheet set. Organic cotton covers and sheets paired with a wool mattress topper will protect your baby from toxins, moisture and allergens."

Consider paints made without VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). These paints will have a much milder odor than traditional paints, which will make the painting process tolerable during your pregnancy. Using non-toxic VOC-free paints greatly reduces the amount of toxins circulating through the air, which means better air quality for you and your baby. Non-toxic paints also make for an easier clean up and can be dissolved with soap and water."

Consider using natural wool carpet in your baby\u2019s room. These carpets are free from VOCs and other toxins that may develop from stain protectors or adhesives. These are safer alternatives to traditional wall-to-wall carpeting, which not only contains these chemicals, but also holds dust and allergens. Consider bamboo flooring. Bamboo flooring is not only a healthy choice for your baby, but for the environment as well. Unlike trees that take over 40 years to replenish, bamboo can be grown within a 5 year time frame. Traditional wood floors,  while they look lovely, were probably polished or stained with finishes containing harmful chemicals. If you want to use wood, look for natural wood flooring that has been reclaimed and repurposed, which is healthier for baby and our forests."
