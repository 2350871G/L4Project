Approximately one to two teaspoons of leaves is a good quantity to begin with and is easily adjusted to taste after the initial infusion.

It also warms the vessels since the hot water is then poured into the serving pitcher and from there into the tasting cups. This is done because at room temperature, ceramic teaware is usually quite cold and unsuited to brewing fine teas whose temperature must be carefully controlled.

The best water for tea brewing is spring water with a natural mineral content that\u2019s neither too hard nor too soft. Since T.D.S., \u201ctotal dissolved solids\", or mineral content measured in parts per million, varies greatly from water to water, you may want to do your own taste-test of waters available in your area to determine which one has the best flavor, body and compatibility with the tea you drink."

Black Tea: You'll probably find that water between 85\u00b0 and 95\u00b0C (185\u00b0-203\u00b0F) and a three-minute infusion works best for black tea. You may want to experiment with lower temperatures and longer steeping times. Pu-erh Tea: Use water that\u2019s just come to a boil and infuse 3-5 minutes."
