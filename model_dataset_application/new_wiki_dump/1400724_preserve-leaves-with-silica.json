It should reach about 1 inch (2.5cm) in height. Prepare the leaves. Shorten the stems of the leaves if they're longer than 1 1/2 inches (3.27cm). Arrange the leaves across the surface of the silica in the container.  Pour in more silica gel over the top of the leaves sitting on the other silica gel. Do this very slowly and with care not to cause folds in the leaves. There should be enough silica gel to cover the leaves. Put the glass of water into the microwave.
