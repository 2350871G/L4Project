For instance, if you're always opening and closing the freezer, the temperature will fluctuate, and this will cause water to evaporate from the food. When too much moisture evaporates from the food, the tissue dries out, and that\u2019s what freezer burn is. The main causes of temperature fluctuations in the freezer include opening the door often, freezing too much food at once, freezing food that hasn\u2019t been pre-chilled, and not setting the freezer to the right temperature."

          "description":"As the name suggests, a freezer is meant to be at or below freezing temperature. If the freezer is warmer than that, it will encourage the moisture to evaporate from food faster, and this will lead to freezer burn. For freezers with basic dials, set your freezer to Cold or Low. For freezers with temperature gauges, set it to 0\u00baF (-18\u00baC)."

          "description":"There are many things that can cause the temperature of your freezer to fluctuate, and putting in warm or room temperature food is one of those ways. If you put hot food in the freezer, it will increase the surrounding temperature, and this will cause evaporation and moisture loss in nearby foods. Before transferring food or leftovers to the freezer, chill them in the fridge for one to two hours prior in order to bring down the temperature."

          "description":"Similarly, putting too much thawed food in the freezer at once can also increase the temperature of the freezer, and the moisture loss this causes in surrounding food will lead to freezer burn. To help maintain the temperature in your freezer, only freeze up to three pounds (1.4 kg) of food per cubic foot of capacity at a time. This doesn\u2019t apply for foods that are already frozen, because the freezer doesn\u2019t have to work to equalize the temperature."

This not only wastes energy because the freezer has to work harder to normalize the temperature again, but it also leads to evaporation and moisture loss in the food. Never leave the door of the freezer open for longer than necessary. Organize your freezer to make it easier to find food."

          "description":"Ideally, you want to keep your freezer about 75 percent full at all times. This is because cold food will help keep other food cold, the same way that an icepack keeps food chilled in a cooler. It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t overstuff your freezer, however, as this will restrict ventilation, meaning the temperature inside the freezer will be inconsistent."

Leave about four inches (10 cm) of headspace at the top of the freezer, and a couple inches on the bottom. If your freezer doesn\u2019t have a shelf or rack for the bottom, consider installing one that will allow cold air to easily circulate throughout the freezer."

One of the easiest ways to do this is to use containers that are meant for the freezer, because they tend to be thicker, more durable, and more airtight. The best materials for housing frozen food are plastic containers, glass containers or jars, or freezer bags. Jars are great for liquid foods, and bags and containers are ideal for solids. Plastic wrap, waxed paper, and aluminum foil should only be used in conjunction with a proper freezer-safe container or bag. Use glass and plastic containers with airtight lids. For bags, choose ones that are specifically designed to be freezer bags. These tend to be made of thicker plastic and can be sealed to keep air out. Avoid plastic wrap and Styrofoam food containers, as these aren't airtight."

You can double-wrap non-liquid foods like bread, baked goods, leftovers, and more. Wrap the food tightly in one to two layers of aluminum foil, waxed paper, or plastic wrap. Then, transfer the wrapped food to a sealable freezer bag.
