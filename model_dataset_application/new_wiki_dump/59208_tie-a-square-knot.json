Britt Edelen\t\t\tOutdoor Educator\t\t\t\tDid You Know?

However, it isn't necessarily the strongest knot, so keep that in mind."

Pull all four ends tight with even tension. Congratulations! Your knot should be exactly the same as the one you made in the method above. Modifying Your Square Knot Add extra half knots for added support. To make your square knot a little stronger, skip the \"pull tight\" step in either of the methods above above and instead repeat the over-and-under half knot pattern to create an additional half knot on top of the square knot. You can \"stack\" as many of these half knots as you'd like to give your knot additional strength. Note that even \"stacking\" square knots in this way won't make your knot safe for critical usage. Don't use square knots (even stacked ones) for securing heavy loads or dangerous objects \u2014 they can (and do) fail.
