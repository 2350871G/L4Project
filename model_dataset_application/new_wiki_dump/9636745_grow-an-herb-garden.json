If you live in an area where summer temperatures frequently rise above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C), choose an area that gets sun in the morning but not in the afternoon. You can also choose an area that gets filtered light, like under a large tree."

Rosemary, sage, mint, oregano, and marjoram all need a 3 ft (0.91 m) to 4 ft (1.2 m) diameter per plant. Basil, thyme, tarragon, and savory all need a 2 ft (0.61 m) diameter per plant. Cilantro, chives, dill, and parsley only need a 1 ft (0.30 m) diameter per plant."

          "description":"Herb roots won't grow too far, but creating a barrier around your herb garden prevents other plant life \u2013 like grass \u2013 from invading. Once you've determined how much space you need for your garden, install garden barriers around the perimeter. You can use actual garden barrier or planks of wood. They should extend about 2 in (5.1 cm) above the ground."

          "description":"Use a large garden fork to dig about 12 in (30 cm) into the soil where you're planting your herbs. As you dig down, turn the fork slightly to loosen the soil. Loose soil allows the herbs' roots to grow and for water to get to the roots."

If you need to raise or lower the pH of your soil, use compost that will allow you to do that. Add about 3 in (7.6 cm) of compost to the top of the soil. Then gently mix the compost into the soil. If you need to raise the soil pH, look for compost with oyster shell lime in it. To lower the pH, look for compost with elemental sulfur."
