This style of trap is an easy and quick one to set up. Set up the trap by placing it firmly in the middle of a tunnel. You won't need to dig anything up, but instead, shove it into a tunnel using your shoe. Circular rodent traps. These types of traps are more economical and can work for gophers and rats as well. For this trap you'll need to dig up the mound carefully. Then place the trap into the mound and seal any cracks that release light with dirt. Loop choking style traps. This type of trap probably requires the most work, but the community suggests it is very effective once you get the hang of it. You'll need to cut two slots into an active tunnel. The trap is then lowered into the tunnel in a way that the choker loop is ready to catch unwanted moles."

If you do decide to use a gassing agent, you'll need to be extremely careful. If you successfully gas a major nest or repeat gassing them, you should have positive results.
