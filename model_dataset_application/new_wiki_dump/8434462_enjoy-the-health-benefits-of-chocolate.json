          "description":"As a rule of thumb: the darker the chocolate, the healthier it is. This is because dark chocolate contains a higher percentage of cocoa, which is where the health benefits of chocolate come from. Further, a higher percentage of cocoa means less of the unhealthy ingredients that are often included in low-cocoa chocolate bars. Look for a dark chocolate that is at least 70% cocoa. Chocolate with this percentage of cocoa is usually considered bitter-sweet. The higher the percentage of cocoa, the more bitter the chocolate will be. You can also purchase 100% cocoa nibs, though they are especially bitter and not usually eaten on their own."

In short, different types of processing, including fermentation, alkalizing, and roasting all reduce the health benefits offered by cocoa. Note that most commercial chocolates are heavily processed. Even many dark chocolate bars are made with cocoa that has been highly processed, and will not offer as many health benefits as bars made with raw cocoa. Often, local, artisan chocolate makers are the best place to find the healthiest chocolate. If you\u2019re at the store, opt for an organic, fair-trade dark chocolate."

Raw cocoa comes in powder or nib form, and can be consumed in various ways, including rich savory dishes.

Often, products labeled \u201cground chocolate\u201d or \u201cdrinking chocolate\u201d will include other less healthy ingredients.

Gently simmer it all together for 10 minutes in a small saucepan and strain the cream before serving. This particular sauce goes well with veggies, including carrots, sweet potatoes and butternut squash. For example, roast cubed butternut squash seasoned with coconut oil and cumin seeds in the oven for about 15 minutes at 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C). Top with the cocoa cream sauce."
