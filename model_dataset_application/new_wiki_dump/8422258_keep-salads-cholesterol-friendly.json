          "headline":"Top your salads with a portion of beans.",
          "description":"Beans are high in soluble fiber, which binds to cholesterol and prevents it from entering your circulation. Research studies have indicated that adding half a cup of cooked beans to your salad (when eaten once daily for two months) can substantially reduce your high cholesterol. When adding beans to your salad, plan to start with common varieties including black and pinto beans. These should all be in stock at your local grocery store. Once you\u2019re familiar with these types of beans, you can branch out into less common types of bean including garbanzo and navy beans. Other legumes will have the same beneficial effect of lowering bad cholesterol: try adding a handful of sprouts, a dollop of hummus, or a serving of falafel to your next salad."

          "headline":"Add a handful of nuts to your salad.",
          "description":"Topping your salad with a moderately sized handful of nuts, such as almonds, pecans, or walnuts, can decrease your LDL (bad) cholesterol by 10%. If you\u2019re not in the mood for nuts on your salad, consider substituting a handful of healthy seeds, such as sesame, sunflower, or flax seeds. In addition to providing healthy, unsaturated fats and delicious flavors, nuts are also a substitute for high-cholesterol croutons. Croutons, as with many other breads and grain products, are high in bad cholesterols."

          "description":"Unlike other types of fatty, unhealthy meat, salmon is actually quite healthy when added to a salad. Salmon is a fatty food, but its fats are good for your health: the fish is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which boost your heart health and can help lower LDL cholesterol. Salmon is a rich fish with plenty of flavor, so you won\u2019t need to put a large amount on a salad in order to taste the fish. Like most fish, salmon can be pulled apart into neat \u201cflakes\u201d once it\u2019s been cooked. Cook your salmon\u2014say, a quarter pound\u2014and then flake off as much as you please on top of your salad."

          "description":"Meat is high in fats and bad cholesterol and should be put on a salad only sparingly, if at all. High-fat meats and fried meats\u2014such as bacon\u2014are among the least-cholesterol-friendly types of meat to put on a salad. Fatty meats are high in saturated fats and cholesterol, both of which raise the level of \"bad\" LDL cholesterol in your body. If you enjoy meats on your salad, opt for a leaner cut. Look at your local deli for lean cuts of meat (those that contain less fat), or purchase a package of cold-cuts that is marked \u201clow fat.\u201d Opt for lighter meats\u2014such as turkey and chicken\u2014over fatty pork and beef."

          "description":"Creamy, rich salad dressings tend to be high in fats\u2014especially saturated fats\u2014which will increase the levels of cholesterol on the salad. Avoid these fatty salad dressings; to check which dressings are relatively high in saturated fats, examine the nutrition facts label on the back of the salad-dressing bottle. Thinner, vinegar- and oil-based dressings\u2014such as balsamic vinaigrette\u2014will contain less bad cholesterol than rich, creamy dressings including ranch and blue cheese. You can also skip the dressing altogether, and substitute a few cut-up pieces of fruit. Slice a sweet and juicy fruit (like an orange or a handful of strawberries) into bite-sized cubes and toss the fruit in with your salad."

          "headline":"Hold the cheese.",
          "description":"If you normally put shredded or crumbled cheese on your salads, you may want to reconsider. Many of the types of cheese commonly added to salads\u2014such as feta, blue cheese, cheddar, mozzarella, and gouda \u2014 are high in saturated fats, which are directly linked to LDL cholesterol. If you\u2019d still like to serve cheese on your salad, look at your local grocery store for cheeses marked \u201clow fat,\u201d as these will have fewer saturated fats and less cholesterol. Serve these cheeses in moderation on your salad. You can also add a dollop of cottage cheese to your salad, as cottage cheese is low in cholesterol."

When choosing lettuce for your salad\u2014romaine, iceberg, green leaf\u2014be aware that they\u2019re all cholesterol-friendly. Use the type of lettuce that you prefer, or change the types you eat for the sake of variety. If you\u2019re tired of the three mentioned types of lettuce, consider expanding to spinach leaves, spring leaves, kale, or a mix that combines multiple types of lettuce. Spinach is a healthy and delicious lettuce substitute; it\u2019s high in fiber (a cup of spinach contains 6 grams of fiber), which helps your body lower its levels of cholesterol."

          "headline":"Add a variety of vegetables to the salad.",
          "description":"Nearly all garden vegetables are very low in fats and contain no saturated fats, making them ideal candidates for you to include in salads. It\u2019s especially important that you include veggies that are high in antioxidants, which help lower your body\u2019s cholesterol levels. When you\u2019re shopping for salad ingredients at your local grocery store, look for veggies like cabbage, carrots, onions (either raw or cooked), soybeans, and tomatoes. Many of these ingredients can be chopped and served on top of your salad, while others\u2014including cabbage\u2014can be used in the place of lettuce itself."

Consequently, avocados will help raise your levels of good cholesterol, and lower levels of bad cholesterol. Avocados are commonly served as a garnish on the top of a salad. Cut each avocado half into thin slices, and arrange these on top of your salad. Alternately, cut each avocado half into half-inch squares, and sprinkle a half-cup or so on top of your salad."

Begin your salad with a base of mixed greens (spinach, romaine, etc. ), and top it with a 2- or 3-ounce portion of tuna. For additional flavor and textures, add about 2 tablespoons each of healthy grains including sunflower seeds, dried cherries or raisins.

If you would prefer not cut up the grapefruit\u2014which could result in a large amount of liquid in the salad\u2014try pulling the slices into finely \u201cshredded\u201d segments.

Compared to thick, creamy salad dressings, these contain a higher percentage of healthy fats that help reduce cholesterol levels. They are still high-fat foods, so use a small amount with other flavorful ingredients. For example, mix \u00bd cup of olive oil with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, \u00bc teaspoon of paprika, 1/8 teaspoon of dry mustard, and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Combine all of these ingredients in a mixing bowl and beat together until well blended. The liquid ingredients may separate, so be sure to shake the dressing well before serving."
