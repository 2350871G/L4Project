You should also mince the onion into even smaller pieces. When you buy your bologna, make sure the pieces are cut in thick slices or in a large chunk. They will be easier to cube this way. You can also use chicken or ham in this recipe. Just switch out the bologna with 2 cups of boiled chicken or 1 pound of ham if you prefer either to bologna. The cubes don't have to be precise, but they need to be small and easy to eat. The onion is optional. If you do not like fresh onion, you can omit it. If you just don't like the taste of normal onions, you can use chives or green onions instead."
