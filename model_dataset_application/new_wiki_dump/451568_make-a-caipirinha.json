Substitute white rum for a caipirissima. Rum is a sugar based alcohol like cacha\u00e7a (from molasses, rather than sugarcane juice) and produces a similar, though less earthy flavor. Because of its simpler flavor profile, rum mixes slightly better with fruit than cacha\u00e7a. Substitute sake for a caipisake. These are best made following the traditional recipe, as sake loses its particular flavors and aromas when mixed with fruit."
