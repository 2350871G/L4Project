To grow sprouts, cut a yam in half and submerge one portion in a glass of cool water. Insert toothpicks at three points around the middle of the yam and suspend it over the container, half-submerged in the water. Make sure the yam you choose looks healthy. If you notice discoloration or lesions on the skin, your yam could be diseased, which means its sprouts could be diseased, too. Choose a yam variety like TDA 291 or TDA 297 that is resistant to Scorch, a fungal disease that causes spots and lesions."
