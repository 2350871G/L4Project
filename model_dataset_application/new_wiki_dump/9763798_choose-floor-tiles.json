They are easy to install on your own, but you\u2019ll need to work harder at keeping them clean, as they are porous and absorb liquids. For a classic look, choose un-textured, solid color tiles. Show your personal style with fun colors, designs, or textures."

Porcelain tiles have a classic look that is easy to fit into any style. These tiles can be more expensive than other options. If you choose porcelain tiles, it\u2019s better to get them professionally installed, as they are very difficult to cut."

It\u2019s great for people who want a floor that absorbs impact, and it\u2019s also resistant to water and germs, making it a good choice for kitchens and bathrooms. You can find natural cork or colored cork."

Bamboo tiles look similar to wood flooring, but they\u2019re made of the fast-growing grass. You can find bamboo tiles in strips or planks. Bamboo also holds up well in homes with pets."

Natural tiles look best with traditional, classic, or rustic decor. However, you can make them fit with any style if you choose a neutral color. You can also choose from different textures and colors to fit the style of your home."

Lay the tiles point-to-point instead of side-to-side. You will likely need to use your tile cutter to trim the edge tiles. You can create this style with both large and small tiles, though smaller tiles will make the room look even bigger. However, they will also take longer to install. If you want to install the tiles yourself, it\u2019s a good idea to avoid porcelain tiles, which will be harder to trim."
