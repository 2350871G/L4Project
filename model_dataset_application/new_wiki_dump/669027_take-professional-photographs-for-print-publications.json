      "description":"Lighting and distance. Subjects are great indications of where and what you are doing wrong. Experiment! Capture your subject in different lights and at various distances. Adjust the settings of your camera to suit the lighting conditions and the distance between you and your subject. Use the flash to a minimum! Use as much natural light in your compositions as you can, this provides for a better quality in your image and also allows you to utilise the functions on the camera more, effectively keeping you from depending on your flash for lighting. Blur, Angles and Balance. Landscape and environmental compositions are also great practice runs for your camera. Use the camera around your house experimenting with different lines and shapes in the lounge for example. Colour is also a great compositional solution to experiment with. The backyard promises for some amazing colours and natural outdoor light."

Refining your work illustrates your eye for perfection: this comes down to removing red-eyes, re-touching conspicuous flaws, adjusting the brightness, contrast or saturation of your image etc (highlighting shadows, enhancing colour using pictographs to name a few). I have found this step to be one of the most important in my pursuit of journalistic success. Being able to re-work original material shows the processes in which you have taken in creating a masterpiece from a simple photographic concept."
