Then, add your flowers. Give the bag a few good shakes and then remove the flowers. Some of the dust and dirt should come off this way. This can work great with dried flowers and wreathes as well."

          "description":"Cornmeal can help remove dust and grime from very dirty flowers. Fill a Ziploc bag with four to five tablespoons of cornmeal. Corn meal can act like a tiny sponge and remove unwanted grime from flowers. Place the flowers in the bag and seal it. Shake the bag for about 60 seconds. When you remove the flowers, shake them lightly to remove excess cornmeal and then remove the flowers. Dust and dirt should be removed."

You can buy compressed air at most department stores and then use it to remove dust and dirt from silk flowers. You can use the compressed air to blow light coverings of dust and dirt off the flowers. However, you should avoid compressed air on very delicate silk flowers. It may cause petals to crumble."

Turn the hair dryer to a low setting and use it to blow any unwanted dirt and grime from the flowers. This is very effective with very light layers of dust. Heavier dust or dirt may not respond as well to a hairdryer."

In this case, you can wash flowers in water with dish soap in a sink full of warm water, mix in two to three tablespoons of gentle dish soap. You can then gently swish your flowers in the water. This should remove any unwanted dirt and grime. When you're done, set your flowers on a towel. Allow them to air dry.

If you've never exposed your flowers to water before, spritz a light amount of water on a small corner of the flowers to see if it causes damage first."

A mild amount of water will wash off set in dirt and dust. However, make sure manufacturer's instructions first as some silk flowers are not dishwasher friendly. This can result in your dishwasher getting stained and flowers getting damaged. As always, make sure your flowers respond well to water by adding a small amount to the flowers before washing them."

This does not work well for removing built up dust or debris, but can remove a light gathering of dust. During your regular dusting, make a habit of lightly dusting silk flowers.
