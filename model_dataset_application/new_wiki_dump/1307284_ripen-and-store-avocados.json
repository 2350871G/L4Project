          "description":"Avocados will naturally ripen on their own at room temperature on the counter. You can also speed up the ripening process so the avocados will be ready to use in two to three days. To hasten the ripening, put the avocados into a paper bag and fold the top of the bag over on itself twice. Avocados naturally create something called ethylene gas, which makes fruit ripen faster. When the avocados are in a paper bag, the ethylene gas gets trapped, and this helps to ripen the fruit faster than if the gas escaped into the air."

          "description":"Place the avocados somewhere warm, like on the counter near a sunny window. Check them after two days to determine if they're ripe. If they still need more time, close the bag again and leave the avocado for another day. Non-bagged avocados generally need four to seven days to ripen, but bagged avocados may be ready in two to three. Ripening an avocado in a bag won't affect the flavor, and will result in a delicious and buttery fruit."

          "description":"There are two main indications that an avocado is ripe, and they are color and texture. First, check the color. The skin of a ripe avocado will turn a deep greenish-black. Next, give the fruit a gentle squeeze. A ripe avocado will yield to gentle pressure. An unripe avocado will have light or dark green skin and will feel firm when squeezed. An overripe avocado will be dark black, look slightly shrunken, and will feel mushy when squeezed. When you cut into an overripe avocado, the flesh will have turned brown in many spots."

Preheat the oven to 200 F (93 C). The oven is superior to the microwave for ripening avocados rapidly. The microwave can leave the avocado mushy and tasteless. An avocado that's softened in the oven won't have the same buttery flavor that a truly ripe avocado does, but it will be softer and easier to peel, cut, and mash."

To trap that gas and help the avocado soften, wrap the avocado in aluminum foil. Instead of using foil, you can also place the avocado in a baking dish with a tight-fitting lid. This is particularly useful if you're trying to soften multiple avocados."

Give it a gentle squeeze through the foil to test for softness. Return the avocado to the oven for 10-minute increments if it still feels firm. When the avocado is soft and gives to gentle pressure, set it aside and let it cool in the foil."
