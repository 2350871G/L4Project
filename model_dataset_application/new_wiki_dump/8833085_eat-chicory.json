Rinse the chicory leaves again, then allow any excess water to drain. You can also sort through the leaves to pick out debris as you\u2019re rinsing them. You can use this same process to remove bitterness from chicory root. Scrub the root clean with a vegetable brush."

Use a sieve to pour out and discard the water, keeping the leaves. If you don\u2019t mind some bitterness, you may prefer to stop cooking the leaves after this first boil. Chicory leaves are the least bitter in early spring, and increase in bitterness throughout the growing season. They will be more bitter if the growing conditions are poor."

Blanched leaves can have a slight bitterness also, so you may want to boil them twice to remove the bitter flavor. If you want to remove all bitterness for unblanched leaves, continue on to a third boil."

Add the cooked leaves to a recipe of your choosing; for instance, you can braise them in butter, or add them to a salad. Chicory leaves that haven\u2019t been blanched are more bitter, so to remove bitterness completely you\u2019ll want to boil them three times. Use a few trial leaves, if desired. Cook one leave once, one leave twice, and the third through all three boils. See which one you prefer before cooking all the leaves."
