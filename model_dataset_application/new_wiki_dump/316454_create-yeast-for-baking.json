  "text":" Using Dry Yeast Buy a small packet of dry yeast.  Put the yeast in water of about 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F).  Add sugar to the yeast and water and keep the mix at between 30\u201338 \u00b0C (86\u2013100 \u00b0F).  Keep feeding sugar to the yeast and it will continue to grow.  Make sure to feed your yeast every time you bake with it, and if you bake infrequently, feed it at least once a week. Take out the yeast you intend to use for baking and add enough warm water and sugar to bring the starter back up to its former volume. Using Dough Make bread using store bought yeast.  Retain approximately one cup of the dough.  Flatten the retained dough and place it in your flour bin.  Take the now dried and hardened piece of dough out of the flour bin a day before baking bread the next time.  Place the dry, hard dough into a bowl of warm potato and sugar water to soak.  Use the frothy water the next day as yeast and repeat the process, saving some dough for the next baking day.  Making Yeast Cakes Make yeast \"cakes\" with this method.  Bring one pint of buttermilk to a boil then remove it from the stove.  Stir and add cornmeal until the mixture quite thick then cool.  Soak yeast packet in warm water.  Stir the yeast into the cornmeal/buttermilk mixture and allow it to rise overnight.  Stir in half a cup or so of white flour and extra cornmeal to make the dough very stiff.  Roll out to thickness of store-bought cakes, cut into squares and let dry.  Use like store bought yeast cakes. ",
