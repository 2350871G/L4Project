Some companies are even friendly enough to reward their best beta testers with free play time, items, and (rarely) free accounts. Most open-source MMORPGs will have free servers."

      "description":"A shard is a player-run server of an online game. Searching for them gives you two benefits: you'll know what game to buy and you'll know where to play for free once you have your game. Shards also have the added benefit of sometimes running special rule sets that the original creators don't run on their servers."
