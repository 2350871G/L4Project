Ensure that the sweetened condensed milk is incorporated. The mixture will start to look snowy white after you add the sweetened condensed milk and almond extract. You can use vanilla extract if you prefer the flavor of vanilla over almond."

Stir the punch gently so it combines. You can prepare the mixture ahead of time. Just refrigerate the punch mixture and add the soda right before you're ready to serve it."

Gently drop the ice cream snowballs into the punch bowl. If you want a slightly melted effect, consider scooping and adding the snowballs to the punch about half an hour before you plan on serving the punch. This will give the snowballs a chance to melt a little."

Set the snowballs into the punch. If you'd like the snowballs to keep they're round shape, you can place the scoops of ice cream on a baking sheet and freeze them until they're completely hard again. Then you can add them to the punch."

Scoop the frozen yogurt into round balls that look like snowballs. Add the snowballs to the punch and stir them so they start to melt into the punch. For an even rosier punch, you could use a different flavor of frozen yogurt. Try strawberry frozen yogurt for a really vibrant punch."

Top the red punch with fresh cranberries or slices of orange for a holiday touch. To make the cranberries look frosty, rinse them with water and roll them in sugar. The sugar will coat the berries so they look frozen."
