          "description":"Play around on sites like MTGDeckBuilder and MTGVault. See what cards you can imagine yourself playing and what style suits the way you think. The color(s) you will use in your MTG deck will determine which \u201cLand\u201d cards that you will put in the deck. You will be able to cast \u201cColorless\u201d spells (spells that have no colored mana symbols in their \u201cmana cost\u201d) regardless of the color(s) you choose. The more colors you choose for your deck to incorporate, the higher the chance that you will encounter a situation where you will be unable to cast one or more of the spells in your hand due to lacking one (or more) of the colors of mana those spells require in their \u201cmana cost\u201d. Plan accordingly. White's strengths are a roster of small creatures that are strong collectively: protecting those creatures with enchantments, gaining life, preventing damage to creatures or players, imposing restrictions on players, reducing the capabilities of opposing creatures, and powerful spells that \"equalize\" the playing field by destroying all cards of a given type. White creatures are known for their \"protection\" from various other colors, or even types of cards rendering them nearly impervious to harm from those things. Numerous white creatures also have \"First Strike\", \"Lifelink\", and \"Vigilance\". White's weaknesses include a focus on creatures, its unwillingness to simply kill creatures outright (instead hobbling them with restrictions that can be undone), and the fact that many of its most powerful spells affect all players equally\u2014including the casting player. Blue is best at letting a player draw additional cards; permanently taking control of an opponent's cards; returning cards to their owner's hand; and countering spells, causing them to be discarded and the Mana used to pay them wasted. Blue's creatures tend to be weaker than creatures of other colors, but commonly have abilities and traits which make them difficult to damage or block, particularly \"flying\" and to a lesser extent \"shroud\". Blue's weaknesses include having trouble permanently dealing with spells that have already been played, the reactive nature of most of its spells, and a small (and expensive) roster of creatures. Black is best at destroying creatures, forcing players to discard cards from their hand, making players lose life, and returning creatures from the dead. Furthermore, because Black seeks to win at all costs, it has limited access to many abilities or effects that are normally available only to one of the other colors; but these abilities often require large sacrifices of life totals, creatures, cards in hand, cards in library, and other difficult-to-replace resources. Black is known for having creatures with the ability \"Intimidate\", making them difficult to block. Lesser black abilities include \"Deathtouch\" and \"Regeneration\". Black's main weaknesses are an almost complete inability to deal with enchantments and artifacts, its tendency to hurt itself almost as badly as it hurts the opponent, and difficulties in removing other Black creatures. Red's interests include destroying opposing lands and artifacts, sacrificing permanent resources for temporary but great power, and playing spells that deal \"direct damage\" to creatures or players, usually via applications of fire. Red has a wide array of creatures, but with the exception of extremely powerful dragons, most are fast and weak, or with low toughness, rendering them easier to destroy. Some of Red's cards can turn against or hurt their owner in return for being more powerful for their cost. Red also shares the trickery theme with Blue and can temporarily steal opponents' creatures or divert spells, although generally not permanently. Many of Red's most famous creatures have the \"Haste\" trait, which lets them attack and use many abilities earlier. The ability to raise a creature's power temporarily is also common among Red's creatures. Red's weaknesses include its inability to destroy enchantments, the self-destructive nature of many of its spells, and the way in which it trades early-game speed at the cost of late-game staying power. Red also has the vast majority of cards that involve random chance. Green has a large number of creatures, which tend to be the largest in the game for their cost. Many of its spells make them stronger temporarily. It can also destroy \"unnatural\" artifacts and enchantments, increase a player's life total, get extra lands or other mana sources into play, and produce the other four colors of mana. Green creatures often have \"Trample\", an ability which lets them deal attack damage to an opponent if blocked by a weaker creature. Green's weaknesses include its difficulty destroying creatures directly; a distinct shortage of flying creatures, and a lack of strategic options other than its signature large creatures."

          "headline":"Determine a \u201cdeck concept\u201d.",
          "description":"There are five main types of non-land cards in MTG. These are \u201cCreature\u201d, \u201cSorcery\u201d, \u201cInstant\u201d, \u201cEnchantment\u201d and \u201cArtifact\u201d. While it is possible to build a deck in nearly any combination of these types, the vast majority of MTG decks will have a significant number of \u201cCreature\u201d cards (generally between 30% and 40% of the deck) with which to \u201cAttack\u201d during your \u201cDeclare Attackers Phase\u201d, \u201cBlock\u201d during your \u201cDeclare Blockers Phase\u201d, and to activate the various \u201cActivated Abilities\u201d that many creatures have printed on them. Creatures can also have \u201cStatic Abilities\u201d printed on the card that provide a constant effect on the \u201cBattlefield\u201d. One main premise of building a successful MTG deck is to choose cards that will work well or elevate the abilities of one another. Choosing what type of recurrent themes to feature in your deck is central to this process and will comprise your \u201cdeck concept\u201d. An example of a \u201cdeck concept\u201d would be to include a large number of \u201cCreature\u201d cards in your deck with the \u201cCreature Type\u201d of \u201cElf\u201d as well as abilities that support other Elves, thereby combining their effectiveness. Keep in mind that in many cases, versatility is as important as your devotion to your \u201cdeck concept\u201d. An over-commitment to your \u201cdeck concept\u201d may lead to your deck performing its main features very consistently at the expense of creating a glaring vulnerability in the deck. The \u201ctest draws\u201d that you will perform later will assist you in finding a good balance between your devotion to your \u201cdeck concept\u201d and the overall utility of your deck. In addition to a \u201cdeck concept\u201d, your deck will employ a \u201cwin condition\u201d, or a set of circumstances that will lead to your victory. This will be closely tied to your \u201cdeck concept\u201d, as the strategy you implement in your \u201cdeck concept\u201d should, in theory, directly result in your victory. Your \u201cwin condition\u201d can take several forms, but will ultimately result in either dealing lethal damage to your opponent(s) either through combat damage or direct damage, forcing your opponent(s) to draw a card with an empty \u201cLibrary\u201d, or playing a card (or activating an ability) that reads \u201cYou win the game\u201d. Your deck can employ several \u201cwin conditions\u201d."

Most MTG game formats have a minimum card count of 60 cards in your deck (\u201cCommander\u201d requires 100 total cards exactly with no repeated cards except for \u201cBasic Lands\u201d). There is no maximum size to your deck, however the rules state that you must be able to shuffle your \u201cLibrary\u201d in a reasonable amount of time (30 seconds or so). Depending on the exact parameters of your deck, you will need anywhere from 20% to 45% of your deck to be \u201cLand\u201d cards (used as a renewable currency to cast spells). Wizards of the Coast suggests a general \u201crule of thumb\u201d of having \u201cLand\u201d cards comprise 40% of your deck. In a 60-card deck, this means you will have 24 \u201cLand\u201d cards, and therefore you will select 36 \u201cSpells\u201d. If your \u201cdeck concept\u201d is particularly prevalent throughout your deck, it is typically considered wise to limit your deck size to the minimum number of cards allowed in a deck in the corresponding game format. You will consequently draw the strongest cards in your deck more consistently."

(The \u201cconverted mana cost\u201d is the total number of mana required to cast each card, without respect to color.) If your \u201cmana curve\u201d is significantly slanted to the columns of 1 and 2, or alternatively, significantly slanted to high-number columns (5+), you may wish to review your \u201cdeck concept\u201d and attempt to even out this disparity by replacing some of the cards you have chosen."

          "description":"Land is the most important part of your deck. if your land sucks, the deck is going to be at a disadvantage. That doesn\u2019t mean only stock your deck with 4 Evolving wilds, 4 terra morphia expanses, 4 dual land, and 8 basic lands. Find a happy medium, and make sure that the manna ratio reflects the cards. In a reasonably sized deck you should have between 18-28 lands/mana sources. Now that you are ready to insert \u201cLand\u201d cards into your deck, you must again consider the colors that you chose earlier. MTG has two main types of \u201cLand\u201d cards, \u201cBasic Land\u201d cards and \u201cNon-basic Land\u201d cards. Unless a \u201cLand\u201d card reads \u201cBasic Land\u201d on it, it is a \u201cNon-basic Land\u201d. Each \u201cBasic Land\u201d provides one mana to your \u201cmana pool\u201d when you tap it of the color on the card (the \u201cWastes\u201d card provides one colorless mana. Cards with a \u201cWastes\u201d symbol in their \u201cmana cost\u201d require that the mana used be colorless). There are two factors to consider when adding \u201cLand\u201d cards to a deck that has more than one color. The first is the overall number of cards that contain each color, and the second is the total number of colored mana symbols of each type in the \u201cmana costs\u201d of the cards within your deck. These figures will assist you in choosing an appropriate number of \u201cLand\u201d cards that produce the various colors in your deck. A calculator may be useful. The quickest way to determine how many \u201cLand\u201d cards of each type you should add to a deck with two or more colors is to count the total number of colored mana symbols of one type in your deck, then divide that number by the total number of colored mana symbols in your deck. This will provide a ratio you can use to add \u201cLand\u201d cards of that color to the deck. (Example: Deck contains 17 \u201cPlains\u201d mana symbols in the \u201cmana cost\u201d of the cards in the deck, and 38 total colored mana symbols. 17/38 = 0.447. Using that ratio, 0.447*24 (or total desired \u201cLand\u201d cards) = 10.7, so roughly 11 of the 24 \u201cLand\u201d cards in your deck should produce White mana.) There are many \u201cLand\u201d cards in MTG that provide two or more colors of mana when they are tapped, or have a variety of other effects. Replacing a few \u201cBasic Land\u201d cards with these can have powerful effects on your deck, or simply help to make multi-color decks more reliable."

If your \u201cdeck concept\u201d is particularly prevalent throughout your deck, it is typically considered wise to limit your deck size to the minimum number of cards allowed in a deck in the corresponding game format. You will consequently draw the strongest cards in your deck more consistently. Evaluate your \u201cmana curve\u201d. The term \u201cmana curve\u201d refers to an imaginary bar graph (and the smooth curve it represents) that visually enumerates the \u201cconverted mana cost\u201d of the cards in your deck. (The \u201cconverted mana cost\u201d is the total number of mana required to cast each card, without respect to color.) If your \u201cmana curve\u201d is significantly slanted to the columns of 1 and 2, or alternatively, significantly slanted to high-number columns (5+), you may wish to review your \u201cdeck concept\u201d and attempt to even out this disparity by replacing some of the cards you have chosen. Select the \u201cLand\u201d cards that will complete your deck. Land is the most important part of your deck. if your land sucks, the deck is going to be at a disadvantage. That doesn\u2019t mean only stock your deck with 4 Evolving wilds, 4 terra morphia expanses, 4 dual land, and 8 basic lands. Find a happy medium, and make sure that the manna ratio reflects the cards. In a reasonably sized deck you should have between 18-28 lands/mana sources. Now that you are ready to insert \u201cLand\u201d cards into your deck, you must again consider the colors that you chose earlier. MTG has two main types of \u201cLand\u201d cards, \u201cBasic Land\u201d cards and \u201cNon-basic Land\u201d cards. Unless a \u201cLand\u201d card reads \u201cBasic Land\u201d on it, it is a \u201cNon-basic Land\u201d. Each \u201cBasic Land\u201d provides one mana to your \u201cmana pool\u201d when you tap it of the color on the card (the \u201cWastes\u201d card provides one colorless mana. Cards with a \u201cWastes\u201d symbol in their \u201cmana cost\u201d require that the mana used be colorless). There are two factors to consider when adding \u201cLand\u201d cards to a deck that has more than one color. The first is the overall number of cards that contain each color, and the second is the total number of colored mana symbols of each type in the \u201cmana costs\u201d of the cards within your deck. These figures will assist you in choosing an appropriate number of \u201cLand\u201d cards that produce the various colors in your deck. A calculator may be useful. The quickest way to determine how many \u201cLand\u201d cards of each type you should add to a deck with two or more colors is to count the total number of colored mana symbols of one type in your deck, then divide that number by the total number of colored mana symbols in your deck. This will provide a ratio you can use to add \u201cLand\u201d cards of that color to the deck. (Example: Deck contains 17 \u201cPlains\u201d mana symbols in the \u201cmana cost\u201d of the cards in the deck, and 38 total colored mana symbols. 17/38 = 0.447. Using that ratio, 0.447*24 (or total desired \u201cLand\u201d cards) = 10.7, so roughly 11 of the 24 \u201cLand\u201d cards in your deck should produce White mana.) There are many \u201cLand\u201d cards in MTG that provide two or more colors of mana when they are tapped, or have a variety of other effects. Replacing a few \u201cBasic Land\u201d cards with these can have powerful effects on your deck, or simply help to make multi-color decks more reliable. Pick out your creatures. Few creature-less decks can make it. Make sure you don't kill the economy of your deck though. If your creatures are weak, or cost too much Mana, you will die. Don't forget the twist. Everyone wants to win, but the game gets stale and boring unless you can look in the eyes of your enemy and see the look of horror on his or her face as they realize you have killed them with 64 rat tokens. Constructing Your Deck Thread the \u201cLand\u201d cards into your deck (or shuffle thoroughly). The term \u201cthreading\u201d land refers to the process of evenly spacing the \u201cLand\u201d cards throughout the deck (before shuffling your deck to start the game). This helps to ensure that the random element of drawing cards throughout the game will result in a proportionate number of \u201cLand\u201d cards to accompany your \u201cSpells\u201d. Test your deck by drawing seven cards. This action is known as a \u201ctest draw\u201d, and will provide you with a sample of what type of opening hand you can expect while playing with your new deck. After drawing seven cards, look at the top two to five cards of your \u201cLibrary\u201d to see how this hypothetical game might play out, and what options you would have in the first few turns of the game. Due to the random nature of shuffling your deck and drawing seven cards, you should perform this step multiple times for optimal results. Adjust your deck based on your \u201ctest draws\u201d. If you find that after several \u201ctest draws\u201d, you are lacking adequate \u201cLand\u201d cards in order to play the \u201cSpells\u201d in your hand (or the correct colors of mana), you may wish to revisit the number of \u201cLand\u201d cards in your deck (or their associated colors). Other problems that can arise could be a lack of an adequate number of \u201cCreature\u201d cards, or an inability to play any \u201cSpells\u201d until the fourth turn or later of the hypothetical game you established with your \u201ctest draw\u201d. Research additional cards that may be valuable additions to your deck. Now that you\u2019ve built your deck and compiled some information about the way that it will play in an actual game, you should research what other cards that you do not have in your collection that would support your \u201cdeck concept\u201d and help you to finalize your deck, then consider acquiring those cards. In most game formats, you may have a maximum of four cards with the same name in your deck (the card name is the text printed at the top of the card. This rule does not include \u201cBasic Lands\u201d). If you find that you have less than four copies of a card that is central to your \u201cdeck concept\u201d, you may wish to acquire and add the remaining missing copies of that card to cause your deck\u2019s main features to function more consistently (keeping in mind the \u201cmana curve\u201d detailed earlier). Select 15 additional cards to comprise your \u201cside-board\u201d. In most \u201cStandard\u201d and \u201cModern\u201d format tournaments, a player is permitted to keep 15 cards that are not in their deck with them (outside the game). These 15 cards comprise a player\u2019s \u201cside-board\u201d. Before any match, a player is allowed to replace any number of cards in their deck with cards from their \u201cside-board\u201d. This 15-card supplement can be used to add specific utilities or make other necessary adjustments to a player\u2019s deck in-between matches. See How to Build a Sideboard.",
