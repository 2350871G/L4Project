Do not wash your garment after you notice a stain. Washing the fabric sets in the stain and makes it harder to remove. If you've already washed the fabric before you noticed the sticky substance, removing the stain will take more work."

Choose an area that is inconspicuous and isn\u2019t noticeable. This way, you\u2019ll know if the product will stain your fabric. Some delicate fabrics, like satin or silk, are more likely to become stained than more durable fabrics, like cotton or polyester. If the removal product does happen to stain your garment, choose another removal product. Test this new product in another inconspicuous area to make sure it doesn\u2019t stain."
