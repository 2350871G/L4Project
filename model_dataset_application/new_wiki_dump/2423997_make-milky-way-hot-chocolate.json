  "text":" Steps Gather Milky Way bars. You can decide how many of them you want depending on how many servings you want, and how strong you want the taste to be. Put the bars in either: A pot A microwave safe container Add about one fourth of a cup of milk to the mixture. If on a stove, heat until melted and you can easily stir them with a spoon. However, they may stay thick due to the caramel and nougat, so if it does not stir like a liquid, it is fine. If using a microwave, heat the bars until they are melted so you can stir them. Make sure the container is microwave safe. Turn the heat very low and continue stirring as the hot chocolate cooks so that the Milky Ways stay warm and melty, and do not get to thick to drink.  The Cocoa Get hot chocolate mix, milk or water, and a microwave/stove safe container.  If using a stove, pour the water or milk into a pot. Heat the liquid on high until it boils, then turn the heat off immediately. Pour the hot chocolate mix into the pot and stir it into the milk/water until the liquid turns a rich shade of brown. If using a microwave, put the milk or water in a microwave safe container and heat on high for 1-2 minutes, depending on your taste and microwave strength. Pour the contents of the mix package into the container and stir until well blended. Pour the hot chocolate into a mug. Slowly add the milky way mixture and stir constantly, but slowly. Make sure the hot chocolate doesn't spill because you are stirring too fast. Stir and serve! You can add extra toppings such as milky way bars, chocolate shavings, whipped cream, or other things to make your cocoa just that more delicious!",
