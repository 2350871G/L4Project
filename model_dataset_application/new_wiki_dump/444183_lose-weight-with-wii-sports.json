You could also scour the internet on sites like eBay for second hand consoles if you can't afford one brand new or you simply can't wait on that list any longer!"

      "description":"Your Wii sports game will be included in the box your console arrived in. Remember it is very important you use the wrist strap as there is a chance it could come flying out of your hand during game play and injure someone. It could also damage possessions like that very expensive TV you might have."

      "headline":"Do a Wii fitness age test, or you can simply start training.",
      "description":"Aim to do 30 minutes game play everyday on Wii sport. Make sure you use full body movement, e.g. when hitting the tennis ball, do it as if you were playing real tennis, moving around and using full swing."

      "headline":"Decide which sport you're going to play.",
