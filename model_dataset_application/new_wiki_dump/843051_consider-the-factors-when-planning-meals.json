Most of the foods you eat every day should fit into one of these categories. Try to make plant-derived foods such as whole grains, vegetables and fruits the foundation of every meal. After establishing a basis of plant-derived foods for a meal, then add in a moderate amount of low-fat dairy and lean protein items."

Mix up it by using an assortment of colors, shapes, flavors and textures. The diversity in your choices will also make meals more interesting and appealing for everyone."

Unless you intend to make a lot of food so that there will be leftovers, try to follow basic serving size guidelines. One serving of meat or fish is approximately 3 ounces. One serving of dairy is approximately 1 cup. One serving of vegetables is approximately 1 cup raw and \u00bd cup cooked. One serving of whole grains is 1 slice of bread, 1 cup of dry cereal, and \u00bd cup cooked rice, cereal and pasta. One serving of fruit is 1 medium sized fresh piece (approximately the size of a baseball) and \u00bc cup dried."
