This means that allergies, skin, eye, and lung irritation, or other adverse reactions could be a concern. Different products are made using different ingredients. Before you bring a particular brand home, it's important to confirm that there\u2019s nothing in it that could pose a threat to your health, or that of your loved ones.Tip: If you or someone in your family has sensitive airways or often experience difficulty breathing, it may be best to use a natural type of flocking, such as soap shavings or desiccated coconut. Alternatively, you can try making your own snow at home using ingredients that you know are safe."

Still, it\u2019s easy to run through a canister of fake snow quicker than you might expect, especially if you intend to spray more than one piece. A single can should be enough to add a light-to-moderate coat to a miniature tree, or multiple wreaths or other pieces. Packaging sizes can vary between products and brands. Some of the most common sizes you'll find are 9 oz. (255 g), 10 oz. (283 g), 13 oz. (368 g), and 18 oz. (510 g). Depending on the use you have in mind for your fake snow, you might be able to get away with purchasing one or two large cans as opposed to several smaller cans."
