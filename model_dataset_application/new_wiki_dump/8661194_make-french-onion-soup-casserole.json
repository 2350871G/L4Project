Cook the onion mixture for 45 minutes. Cook the onion mixture for 45 minutes to one hour, stirring occasionally. The onions should done caramelizing when they are soft and golden.

Simmer the mixture for about 2 minutes until the liquid has almost completely dissolved. You can substitute vegetable broth for beef broth if you want a vegetarian option. Assembling the Casserole Preheat the oven and remove the pot from the heat. Once the broth and wine have almost fully dissolved, take the pot off the heat. Use a slotted spoon to scoop up and remove the bay leaves and the sprigs of thyme. Then let the onion mixture cool for a few minutes. While the onions are cooling, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (176.66 C). Slice the baguette. Take the French baguette and use a bread knife to slice it into thin slices that are about \u00bd inch (1.27 cm) thick. Place the baguette slices spaced out on a baking tray so that they are not touching. Toast the baguette slices. Once the oven has preheated, place the baking tray of baguette slices inside. Toast the slices for about 2-3 minutes, or until they are golden and look slightly toasted. Then take them out and let them cool for a few minutes. Lay the bread in a baking dish. After you cool the bread, lay the slices in a 3 quart baking dish. Lay them in a \u201cshingle\u201d style like the shingles on a roof, laying the first slices next to each other in a row, then starting the next row on top so that they overlap the first layer by an inch (2.54 cm) or so. Spoon the onion mixture on top. After covering the bottom of the baking tray with the bread slices, scoop the onion mixture out of the pot and lay it down on top of the baguette slices, applying the onion mixture in one even layer. Lay down bread and cheese. Lay the remaining baguette slices down over the onion mixture, putting them in a shingle formation like you did with the first layer. Then shred two cups (473.18) of Gruyere cheese using a coarse cheese grater and sprinkle the shredded cheese evenly on top of the bread. Baking the Casserole Put the casserole in the preheated oven. Cover the casserole by spreading tin foil over the top of the baking dish, then place the casserole in the preheated oven. Bake for 40 minutes. Keep the casserole in the oven to bake for 40 minutes, then pull out the casserole and take off the tin foil. Place the casserole back in the oven and switch the oven setting from bake to broil. Broil until golden spots appear in the cheese. Broil the casserole for about 10 minutes, checking every few minutes or so until the cheese on top develops golden or brown spots. Then remove the casserole and turn off the oven. Serve while hot. Garnish the casserole with more thyme leaves, then use a spatula or knife to cut the casserole and serve it while hot. Finished. ",
