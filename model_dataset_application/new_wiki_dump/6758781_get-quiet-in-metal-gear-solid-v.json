As soon as it\u2019s available for development on your iDroid, make sure to spend some GMP on at least the RENOV - ICKX SR (Sniper Rifle). It only costs 40000 GMP to make and should be more than enough to take out Quiet when you meet her later."

Immediately start development on her Wicked Butterfly, and once that\u2019s done, you can then take her out to missions. Bringing Quiet on missions will raise your bond with her and open up development for upgrades to her weapons. One mission that you can farm to raise her bond level with you is Episode 3: A Hero\u2019s Way. Have her take out the commander from a sniping point directly facing his house. Once the commander is eliminated, exit out of the mission zone by helicopter and redo the mission until her bond level gets high enough for you to develop the silenced Guilty Butterfly (extremely useful for non-lethal takedowns of bases and outposts)."
