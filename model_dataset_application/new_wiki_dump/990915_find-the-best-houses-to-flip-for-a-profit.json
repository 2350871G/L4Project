          "description":"This database contains all houses for sale whether under a listing contract by an agent's brokerage or by any other participating broker. Your real estate agent can set up an advanced search in the MLS listing requirements that you would desire in potential houses to flip. For example, tell your real estate agent (or use the MLS search function on the MLS.com website) that you\u2019re looking for houses that are at least 3 bedrooms, 2 bath; minimum 1,300 square feet; and priced between $150,000-$275,000. You can get much more specific with the requirements if you want. For example, ground pools, extra storage, 3 car garage, built before 2005, etc. Just remember that the stricter your requirements are, the fewer houses you\u2019ll get a chance to look at. The MLS website also has a \"Find Foreclosures Near You\" option that could provide a listing of lower priced properties. Your real estate agent can also send you a link to a collaboration center where all of the listings that meet your criteria are organized. In the collaboration center, you can separate the listings based on which ones you're interested in and which ones you don't like. If a new listing is added to the collaboration center, you'll be immediately notified over email."

You can successfully flip property using sales of properties due to unpaid taxes but they\u2019re a bit more risky. You have to really know what you\u2019re getting into and run your own \"comparables\" so you know with certainty the price you should walk away with at the closing table. For unpaid tax sales, you will have to pay all back taxes owed on the property. \"Comparables\" refers to the price that properties are selling for that are similar to the one you are considering in regard to location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, condition, etc. You can find out about tax auctions and sheriff's sales at the website of your county or city. Before the sale you must first register as a bidder. Sales are made at a public auction and buyers will have to bid on the property. You might want to consult beforehand with the attorneys who are representing the financial institutions whose actions resulted in the properties being brought for sale."
