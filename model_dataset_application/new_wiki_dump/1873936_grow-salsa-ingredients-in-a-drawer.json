  "text":" Start Garlic Early Fill the container with potting soil to 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the container rim.  Plant the garlic cloves 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) deep and 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) apart.  Depending on the size of the container you choose, plant as many garlic cloves as will fit while meeting the space requirements.  Water thoroughly just once. Soil should be moist immediately after planting. Place the garlic container outdoors where it will be exposed to sun, rain, and even snow. The elements will provide the necessary light and water until spring. Start Onions Early Fill the container with potting soil to 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the container rim.  Plant the onion sets 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) deep and 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) apart.  Depending on the size of the container you choose, plant as many onion sets as will fit while meeting the space requirements. Remember: the number of onion sets (bulbs) represents the number of onions you will harvest later, so plant at least 3-4 onion sets. Start Cilantro Last Prepare a 13x9x2 inch container by filling with potting soil to just below the rim.  Pat the soil gently to compact.  Mix the cilantro seeds with sand or sugar granules in a 2:1 ratio to distribute.  Sprinkle the sand/seed or sugar/seed mix across the soil in the container.  Sprinkle lightly with additional potting soil just to cover.  Instead of watering with can or hose, use a spray bottle to mist the newly planted seeds with water until moist. Until seedlings appear, this is the preferred method of watering as it will prevent seeds from being washed away. Give the seedlings 6-8 hours of light each day. WARNING: excessive direct sunlight will cause cilantro to grow shoots and develop flowers and seeds prematurely. Harvest cilantro at the same time the salsa vegetables are ready by cutting the plant off at the soil level. All that should remain are little stubs of cilantro stems. Prepare Drawer for Planting Line the drawer with a plastic trash bag. Note: This step is not necessary if using plastic containers. Drill or tap holes into the bottom of the drawer for drainage. Drainage holes should be spaced approximately every 4 inches (10.2 cm) across the entire container bottom. Adequate drainage is important to prevent plants/roots from rotting. Optional step: To prevent loss of dirt through drainage holes, a piece of window screen or even cheesecloth may be laid across the bottom of the drawer before adding soil.  Add potting soil to fill the drawer.  Press soil lightly to compact. Soil level should be 2 inches (5.1 cm) below drawer rim to prevent runoff when watering. Moisten soil lightly with a mist of water before planting.  Plant Salsa Ingredients 'Warning: Be careful not to overcrowd the drawer since each plant has spacial and nutritional needs. Overcrowding can result in an unproductive or under-productive garden. Plant the tomato plant at one end of the drawer.  Plant the jalapeno plant at the opposite end of the drawer.  Transplant the garlic and onion plants from winter containers to the center of the drawer. In each case, transfer as much of the container dirt as possible along with the plant to avoid disturbing the roots. Plant marigolds sparingly around and between the plants, focusing on the tomato plant. Marigolds prevent a number of destructive insects and garden pests. See TIPS for more information. Caring for and Harvesting Plants Water daily, sometimes twice daily. Container gardens dry out much quicker than ground gardens. The best times to water are early morning (the moisture will serve the plants all day) and early evening (the moisture will help the plants recover from a day of sunlight and heat.)

Make sure your garden's location will allow a minimum of 8-10 hours of sunlight each day. Container gardens, including those planted in dresser drawers, have the benefit of being mobile. If you have a wagon, place the drawer on the wagon and move it throughout the day to get the most sun exposure. Allow the tomatoes and peppers to ripen completely on the vine. This will help to produce the best possible flavors.
