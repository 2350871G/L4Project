    {
      "headline":"Study Guru Nanak's image.",
      "description":"If you look carefully at Guru Nanak's picture, you will sense that He has a divine countenance. His palm and the slightly angled head convey the feeling of Him blessing onlookers. Focus on these aspects in order that your creation properly reflects the feeling of him reaching out spiritually."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Pencil in light guidelines and the general shapes.",
      "description":"There are three main divisions in the drawing. The top is for the head, the second is for the abdomen and the lower for the folded legs. Draw an oval in the upper division. Leave some space for the middle of the body. This will require just a tad more space than the head. For the legs, draw a longer, horizontal oval. This oval will become the right leg. As you refine the drawing, you will get a better idea of proportions. Feel free to erase/redraw any of the shapes for accuracy and aesthetics. It will help to sketch the guidelines lightly so that after erasing they won't be visible."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Refine the details of the lower face.",
      "description":"To fill out the jaw area, make an outline of the beginnings of the beard. Right above it sketch some small almond shaped lips and over them, draw two horizontal bent lines, one above the other, for the moustache."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Draw the nose.",
      "description":"Starting above the moustache make a scalloped line horizontally. It should have with 3 curves with the middle curve lower than the other two. Draw a vertical tube using graceful looking curves. His nose will look more realistic if you make it thinner on the top and a bit flared at the bottom."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Draw the eyes.",
      "description":"Make two almond shapes for the eyes, then pencil in some eyelids above of the eyes. The eyelids should be shaped to follow the upper line of the eye. Draw a 'U' inside the almond shape of each eye for the pupils. Try to leave a bit of space between the 'U' shape and the lower eyelid. Doing so helps make the face look wiser and more divine.Tip:Shade the inside of the pupils making sure to leave a little patch of white. For this, you may use any colour that looks natural. The more shaded the pupils, the better they will look."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Sketch the eyebrows.",
      "description":"Make them thick and shaded and a little raised starting at the center to the end. This arch can be linear or curved as is natural for you to draw."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Make the Turban.",
      "description":"Start with a wide \"V\" shape on the forehead and join the points with a downward curving arc. Make it a little less curved than the top of the head. Sketch two roughly vertical lines, one on each side of the upside down \"V.\" Each should flare slightly outward as it rises. Draw a line on top of it by making a downward curving arc, at the very top of the Turban. To make an ornamental turban, add two rows of beaded chain around it. Add details of the folds above the forehead area of the Turban. Just follow the inverted 'V' of the turban. Make folds starting from the left. On the right side, make downward slanting lines."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Give shape to the face.",
      "description":"If the face is looks too round or a bit \"off,\" you can make corrections by erasing the outline of the face and redrawing the slightly curved lines from the Turban to the beard. If your drawing needs no correction, there is no need to erase or change it."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Mark the shoulders.",
      "description":"Below both the ends of the moustache, make two lines for the shoulders. Keep the shoulders slightly rounded."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Add the shawl.",
      "description":"Make an outline for the shawl. Start at the neck (outline of the beard) and make two lines going down from each side of the beard. These delineate the shawl which can be any colour you choose."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Sketch the open palm of the right hand.",
      "description":"You can start by making the lines on the left side of each finger. Have these lines bend slightly towards the right, then connect the lines with an upside down 'U.' Try to keep the ends of the fingers slightly pointed at the tips. Complete the palm with a 'U' or just a curved line. Make three small lines on each finger. After the four fingers are done, sketch an 'L' for the thumb, below the base of the pointer finger. Finish off the thumb in proportion to the fingers. The thumb should be open rather folded across the open palm. For a finishing touch, you can make three lines on the palm."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Make the right arm.",
      "description":"Make a wrist connected to the right palm by closing the wrist line. Sketch the forearm starting from the sleeve of Guru Nanak's robe. Add natural looking creases by drawing a few lines which follow the flow of the garment. The loose sleeves should have lines that go nearly vertically downward."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Add details to the garment.",
      "description":"Make a few vertical lines on the top half of the outfit. Draw a few horizontal lines in the centre of the chest section. Embellish the garment with a few curved lines on the legs."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Make the left arm.",
      "description":"Draw the elbow slightly bent. The arm will end with the hand resting on the knee."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Detail the fingers of the left hand.",
      "description":"Create a bent thumb, the inside of which is an 'S' shape. Outline the other fingers with two bent lines each. You can also draw fingers simply by making four elongated 'U' shape."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Add fingernails to the left hand.",
      "description":"Complete the tips of the fingers using wavy lines, then add 'U' shaped nails on all fingers. The nail on the thumb can be drawn like a comma or a curved '7'. Add detail by making two small lines on each of the finger. To make the fingers even more elegant, you may draw the tips bent to the right."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Draw big toe on the right foot as a stretched '3'.",
      "description":"Half of the right foot will have the right palm on it, so position the big toe accordingly."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Complete the right foot.",
      "description":"Draw the other toes resembling stretched and curving U's. Draw the foot a little away from the tip of the fingers of the right hand. This will help with the proportion of the foot. You can get the toes just right by making each smaller than the first. Create the toenails with a single line for the four smaller toes, but the bigger toe can have a prominent shaped nail."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Draw the left foot.",
      "description":"Drawing only half of the left foot is also okay as the rest of the foot can be assumed to be covered by the robe/ dress. Draw the big toe with a sleeping '3'. For the rest of the toes make four tick marks."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Complete the toes.",
      "description":"Close the toes and make nails on them."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Colour with water based colours.",
      "description":"You can use water based colour where you can mix and create tints (making lighter colour mixing white) and shades (making darker colours mixing black). Using a colour palette will help you to create lighter and darker shades as needed. You can start with the robe (with an orange or any other colour you like), then the body/ skin (using beige or wheatish colour), leading to the turban and finally the background, which can be one single colour or blend of a few colours of your choice. Highlight the folds of the garment with a darker shade, but use a lighter tint for the base colour. Using a darker colour makes the folds seem more realistic. If you are not comfortable with doing this, you can colour the entire area with one colour. When the colouring is over, you can highlight the folds by simply using a black coloured sketching pen or pencil (like an outline for each line). Once the dress/ robe is coloured, colour the skin using a beige or wheatish colour for the skin. To add depth and variation to the skin tone, add a little brown to the pallete. Once you've mixed and found a good darker beige for the darker areas of the body, use it for shading the highlights on His features. These include, but are not limited to the sides of the nose, sides of the face, and the gaps between all His fingers and toes. Colour the beard and the moustache with white colour or a pearl finish white paint. If you like, you can use grey colour to shade it with fine vertical lines."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Colour with crayons or pencils.",
      "description":"Carefully colour the drawing with the colouring instruments of your choice. If you fear the spreading of colours you may use colouring pencils instead of watercolors, oils, or acrylics. If you choose crayons or pencil colours, mixing of colours and creating darker and lighter hues may get difficult. If you are using these you can go ahead and colour it with the colours of your choice and outline it in the end. Intricate areas of the eye and eyebrows can be done with a sharp tip. You need not outline the lips with black. You can use a darker peach or pink"
    },
    {
      "headline":"Add a white or another coloured circle behind His head to give the halo effect indicating holiness.",
      "description":"Alternatively you can create rays on the top section of the drawing. The image you draw can be enhanced by adding a colourful, luminous background surrounding Guru Nanak. You can choose to blend a few colours like a rainbow or use a single colour for the background. Just randomly create uneven patches of a few colours or make proper bands of colours, whichever you prefer."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Colour in monochromatic colour scheme.",
      "description":"Another way of colouring would be to use a single colour of your choice for the entire picture. Here you may create a monochromatic look by using the shades and tints of any one colour. Just mix white in the colour where it requires lighter hues and mix black to the colour for darker shades. You can play with light and darks mostly at the folds of the garment like the sleeves, shawl of the robe and the crevices of the body. If you like, you can leave the entire drawing black and white or outline with a charcoal pencil."
