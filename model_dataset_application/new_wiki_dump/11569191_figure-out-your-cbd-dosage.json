          "description":"Since CBD supplements are not FDA-regulated, there's no standardized dose. However, your doctor may be able to help you calculate a starting dose that's likely to be safe for you. In addition, your doctor can advise you whether you're taking any medications that CBD might interfere with, as well as whether you have any conditions that CBD oil might aggravate. CBD can raise the levels of some medications in your blood, including blood pressure medicine, the same way that grapefruit juice does."

For instance, a tincture that contains 500 mg of CBD and 50 doses would have 10 mg of CBD per dose.

You can then increase that amount gradually if you need to. Keep in mind that some people will not experience any noticeable effects from taking CBD.

It can take a little trial and error to find the right amount of CBD for you. The way CBD works is by impacting your endocannabinoid system, which affects your body's stress, pain, and inflammation responses. Since everyone's endocannabinoid system is different, it can be challenging to find the right dose, so don't be afraid to experiment to find what's right for you."
