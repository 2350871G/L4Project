          "description":"Small pieces of amethyst can be submerged in soapy water for 15 to 20 minutes. This helps loosen up the dirt, making it easier to scrub off dirt and grime. If your geode is too big to submerge, soak a washcloth in warm water and add a small amount of dish detergent to it. Work up a lather and wipe down the sides of your amethyst with the cloth. If your cloth gets dirty while scrubbing, rinse it off and add more soap. You are only trying to loosen up the dirt at this point, so don't worry too much if you're not getting everything off the amethyst. Just make sure to get the amethyst as wet as possible before moving on to the scrubbing process."

          "description":"Amethyst should be rubbed down with a toothbrush after soaking. Use the toothbrush to remove any grease or grime stuck to the amethyst. Work the toothbrush into any unusual cracks and crevices in the amethyst, making sure to scrub harder on dirtier areas. Rinse the amethyst in a bowl of clear water as you brush it off. This helps remove any dirt or grime you dislodged. For a piece of amethyst that's very dirty, this process can take as long as 30 minutes. Have patience and get in a comfortable position as you scrub your amethyst. Amethyst jewelery may not require as vigorous scrubbing, as it is likely not as prone to built up dirt. Something like a geode will require more time commitment, while a piece of jewelery may only need a quick wipe down.

Mark Sandler\t\t\tGraduate Gemologist, Jeweler, & Appraiser\t\t\t\tBe very gentle when you're cleaning amethyst. Only use very mild soap, water, and a toothbrush to clean an amethyst. Rinse it in warm water and dry it with a paper towel. After that, you can use a can of compressed air, like the kind used to clean a computer keyboard, to remove any dirt that's left. However, taking it to a jeweler for a professional cleaning is easier, and they usually don't charge anything."
