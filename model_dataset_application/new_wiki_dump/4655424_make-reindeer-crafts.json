  "text":" Making a Candy Reindeer Plug in the glue gun. Insert one glue stick. Check the glue gun is hot enough so that when you squeeze the trigger liquid glue comes out of the end. Take out a candy cane, but leave the cellophane wrapper on. Take out one puffball. Put one small dot of glue on the short end tip of the candy cane.  Quickly place the puffball on the glue dot.  Take out two googly eyes. Place two small dots of hot glue side-by-side, horizontally, half-way up the short side of the candy cane. Quickly place one googly eye on each of the glue dots.  Cut one pipe cleaner in half.  Use one half of the pipe cleaner to twist around the curve in the candy cane, leaving equal lengths on both sides of the twist.  Take one of the lengths of the pipe cleaner wrapped around the curve in the candy cane and bend it at the twist so that it makes a 90 degree angle. Bend the pipe cleaner so that it faces away from the candy cane. Bend the pipe cleaner in a 90 degree angle again, this time about halfway between the first bend and the end of the pipe cleaner. Bend the pipe cleaner so that it faces up. Repeat the previous two steps with the other length of the pipe cleaner.  Marvel at your tiny, candy cane reindeer! Using the curve of the candy cane, hang it from a Christmas tree branch or wreath. Making a Craft Stick Reindeer Assemble the craft sticks into the shape of an A. Glue in place. The bar of the A is supposed to cross over, just ensure the lengths are even on each side. Let dry completely. Turn the A shape arrangement upside down. Now you should see the basic reindeer shape of ears sticking up (the legs of the A), antlers sticking sideways (the external cross bars of the A). The tip of the triangle is the reindeer's nose. Glue the nose in place first. Use either a red paper or felt circle, or a red pompom. Glue the eyes about halfway between the tip of the triangle and the cross bar of the A shape. Allow to dry in place. Glue the holly pieces in formation in the middle of the crossbar piece. Arrange the three leaves in formation first, then glue the three berries in the middle, where the leaves meet. Allow to dry. Add a hanger loop. Use thin ribbon or wrapping ribbon to make a loop for hanging the decoration from. Either glue in place or wrap around the crossbar neatly. Done. The reindeer decoration is now ready for hanging on the tree, in a window, and so forth. Making a Pipe Cleaner Reindeer Gather the materials outlined in the \"Things You'll Need\" section below.  Cut one brown/orange pipe cleaner in half.  Bend the two halves alike, two inches (5cm) from both ends to create legs.  Twist the two halves together to create a body.  Take the other brown/orange pipe cleaner, and make a three leaf clover loops at the end to create the head.To do a clover loop:  make a loop at the end, twist, make another loop right next to the first loop, twist, and repeat. This should create three loops. Bend at clover to create head, then bend at 1 \u00bd inches (3.81cm) to create neck.  Attach head to body, by twisting the remaining pipe cleaner around the body of the legs. Twist around the body, create a loop at the end near the hind legs for the tail. Cut the yellow pipe cleaner in half for the antlers. Fold one of the 6 inch (15cm) pieces into a \"V\" shape. Fold the ends down to create an \"M\" shape and snip the ends off, so you have a small \"v\" shape.  Twist the snipped ends around each arm of the small \"v\" to create antlers.  Twist the antlers at the base of the head to attach to the reindeer.  Loop the end of scrap red/pink pipe cleaner through middle clover loop to create a red nose. Snip off excess. Finished. Finished!
