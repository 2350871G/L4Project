Delve into your kitchen cabinets, your refrigerator, and even that drawer you always forget about underneath your oven to remove anything that you don\u2019t use on a regular basis. Donate any unexpired food or kitchen supplies that you don\u2019t plan to use. Identify items that you rarely use but want to keep--such as an ice cream maker or fondue pot--and relocate them to another storage space like a utility closet, basement, or off-site storage."

This works great for bulk items like cereals, rice, oatmeal, and nuts. For non-food items like plastic bags, store them in old tissue boxes.

Just purchase a shelf and set it on top of an existing cabinet shelf. Mesh shelves with wire legs work well as do shelves made out of plastic. Repurposing old locker organization shelves also works well because you can easily adjust their height."

Hang the caddy on the wall above the sink or on the side of a nearby cabinet. Never try to mount something that\u2019s load bearing directly onto drywall. In order to hang it securely, you will need to install an anchor first by identifying the strongest point in a wall, drilling a hole, and inserting the right kind of anchor for your surface. If you\u2019re ever uncertain about the security of a wall mount, look online to find a handyman or visit a local hardware store to ask for advice."

You can find these dish dryers online or at big box stores that specialize in storage solutions like Ikea or the Container Store.

Follow the instructions on the package to secure the strip. Do not attach a magnetic strip to a tile backsplash. It will damage it. Never use tape or other adhesives to secure the strip, as it could be dangerous if the strip (along with the sharp knives) fell from the wall."

This hole allows you to hang your pot or pan directly from a hook, which you can easily mount to your wall. Purchase wall hooks and anchors from a hardware store. Drill a hole into a wall stud and insert your hook. If you can't find a stud, then install anchors to support your hooks.

You can purchase towel bars at most home improvement and hardware stores. Follow the installation instructions that come with the bar and always remember to set an anchor if hanging it from drywall.
