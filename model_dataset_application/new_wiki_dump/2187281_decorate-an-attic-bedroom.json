          "description":"If you are primarily concerned with opening the space up, sticking with one solid color is a good way to accomplish your goal. A light colour will help the room look bright, fresh, and open. White and light yellow are especially effective at creating the appearance of additional light. Painting is an inexpensive way to quickly change the look of your room. Before you paint the space, take paint charts into the room to help you imagine what the new colour will look like. Avoid feature walls in attic bedrooms, as this makes the space look smaller."

Paint the ceiling the same colour (or a lighter colour) than your walls to accentuate the height of the room and to make it feel bright. Bright white paint makes attic ceilings look fresh and light."

If they are in poor condition, use your DIY skills to restore them or hire a professional to bring them back to their former glory. To draw attention to these natural textures, expose them as much as possible and avoid placing furniture in front of them. If you don\u2019t like the look of your bricks, consider painting them white. This is a popular look that makes the space look nice and light."

Consider placing it over your bed, as this allows you to stargaze at night and will provide natural light in the morning. Alternatively, place it in a dark corner of your room, to brighten it up. Consider choosing a skylight that can be opened, as this will give you the option of extra ventilation in your room."

Armchairs are great for reading, simple wooden chairs are good for hanging clothes, and peacock chairs are great feature pieces."

These are also useful for storage and displaying small ornaments or plants. Opt for bedside tables that match the rest of your furniture. For example, if your headboard is made of dark wood, choose bedside tables that are also made of dark wood. Aim to have your bedside tables at a similar height to your bed. This looks nice and makes it easier to reach the items on the tables."

Natural light helps to give your room a warm, cosy, and fresh atmosphere. Watch where the sun falls throughout the day. If you spend the most time in your room in the mornings, check where the sun falls in the morning."
