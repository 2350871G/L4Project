          "description":"Fold your paper in half widthwise or hamburger style, then unfold it. The crease down the middle will be your guide. The paper needs to have a smooth texture, so something like cardstock, printer paper, or even a plain paper plate will all work. Do not use construction paper. It will soak up the paint. The size of the paper does not matter, although larger pieces are easier to work with."

          "headline":"Choose 2 to 3 colors pf paint.",
          "description":"You can use acrylic craft paint, tempera paint, or poster paint. Make sure that these colors look nice together, especially when mixed. For example, red, yellow, and orange are a great combination. Blue, pink, and purple is another combination that works well. Don't use opposite colors, such as red and green, or you will get brown. You can use white as 1 of your colors. This will give you a pastel look. Use glittery or metallic paint as 1 of your colors if you want to give your butterfly extra sparkle."

Place some of the blobs closer to the crease, and others further from the crease. Don't put the paint too close to the edge of the paper, or it will squirt out when you squish it."

Sometimes, the shapes look like butterflies, and sometimes they look like something else. Set the paper aside so that it can dry. This can take as little as 15 minutes to as long as an hour. If your butterfly doesn't look like a butterfly at all, you can cut the paper into a butterfly shape. Click here to learn how to turn painted paper into a cut-out butterfly."
