Use paper towels or reusable rags to mop up the mess, and throw them out or launder them when you are done."

Using a scrub brush with stiff bristles, scour the stain from the floor. If this does not work, you can try the same method but with a stronger, store-bought acid or rust remover. For very tough rust stains, you can mix ten parts water to one part muriatic acid. Apply to the stain, and leave it for five minutes before scrubbing out. Do not use acids or vinegar on epoxy floors."

Leave the litter alone for a few hours or overnight to absorb the oil. Sweep it up when you are done. If the cat litter has not completely absorbed the oil after a day, replace it with fresh litter, and leave it for another day. For bad oil spills, this process can take a few days."

These grease removers can typically be bought at a hardware store."

Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes so that it can absorb the dirt and oil. Once the time is up, use your brush to scrub the floor, moving across the entire floor. Once you have finished scrubbing, rinse the floor using a hose. Let the floor dry. Keep the garage door open as you clean. You can use a broom to push the water out of the door outside. This will help it dry. You may want to start far away from the door and move towards it as you clean. When you finish scrubbing, you will be next to the door.

Cover the floor with the cleaning solution, and wait 15 minutes. Turn on the power washer, and spray down the floor, moving the nozzle in broad strokes across your floor as you do  so. Keep moving the spray across the floor; do not let it linger too long on one spot or else it can scratch your floor.

Apply the soapy cleaning solution to the floor. Turn on the buffer, and guide it over the floor. Rinse with a high-pressure hose. Let the floor dry afterwards. It might be easier if you break up the floor into sections. Do one section of floor at a time. Rent a buffer with a nylon scrub head. These are best suited for concrete floors."
