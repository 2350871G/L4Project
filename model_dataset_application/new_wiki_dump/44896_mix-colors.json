However, they can be mixed together to form the 3 secondary pigment colors: red and blue make violet, blue and yellow make green, and red and yellow make orange. Note that when you mix the primary colors of paint together, the secondary colors they produce aren\u2019t very bright or vibrant. That\u2019s because these newly combined pigments subtract more and reflect less light from the color spectrum, giving you secondary colors that are dark and muddy rather than vibrant and bright."

These are yellow-orange (yellow mixed with orange), red-orange (red mixed with orange), violet-red (red mixed with violet), blue-violet (blue mixed with violet), green-blue (blue mixed with green), and yellow-green (green mixed with yellow). These intermediate colors are located between the primary and secondary colors on the color paint wheel."

These are brown (green mixed with orange), brick (orange mixed with violet), and slate (violet mixed with green). These colors are not usually included on paint color wheels, but they are still viable colors that can be produced by mixing other colors together."

          "headline":"Refrain from trying to mix paints to create white pigment.",
          "description":"Paint colors are subtractive, which means that the pigment absorbs some parts of the light spectrum and reflects others, resulting in the color that we perceive in paint pigment. This means that adding different pigments together tends to make your paint darker, because it\u2019s absorbing more and more light. It\u2019s thus impossible to mix paint pigments together to make white paint. If you want to use white paint for your painting project, you\u2019ll have to purchase it instead of mixing it."

You can also make black by mixing the 3 primary colors together but simultaneously adding a greater proportion of blue into the mix. Make sure you don\u2019t add any white or any color that has white in it, like opaque yellow or opaque yellow-green, as this will make your black more like a shade of gray."

The more white paint you add to a pigment, the lighter the tint will be. For example, adding white paint to red paint creates pink, which is a lighter version of red.

          "description":"Darker versions of a color\u2019s original hue are called shades. These are created by adding black paint to a pigment. How dark the shade is depends on how much black paint you add to the original hue; the more black paint you add, the darker the shade. Some artists prefer to add the color's complement, which is its opposite color on an accurate CMY/RGB color wheel. For example, green can be used to darken magenta, and magenta to darken green, because they are across from each other on the color wheel. Add black paint, or a complement, a little at a time so you don't overdo it. If your shade comes out too dark, you can lighten it by adding a little of the original paint color to the mix."

          "description":"Tones are produced by adding both black and white to a color and will appear less intense and less saturated than the original hue. By varying the relative amounts of black and white that you add to your mix, you can obtain whatever lightness and saturation you are looking for. For example, add both white and black to yellow to make light olive green. The black will darken yellow, turning it into olive green, and the white will lighten that olive green. Different light olive greens can be mixed by controlling how much of each is added. For an unsaturated color like brown (dark orange), you can adjust the hue the same way as you would for bright orange: by adding small amounts of nearby colors on the color wheel, such as magenta, yellow, red, or orange. These will brighten your brown as well as change the hue."
