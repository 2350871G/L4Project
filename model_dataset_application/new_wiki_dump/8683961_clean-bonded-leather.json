If the detergent impacts the leather in any way, do not proceed with cleaning. Contact the manufacturer for recommendations on how to clean that particular piece."

Section-by section, wipe down the surface of the leather piece with the detergent-soaked rag. Then, rinse off the section using a second rag moistened with distilled water, but free of detergent. Continue this process in sections until your bonded leather piece has been completely cleaned. You may need to wipe over sections multiple times with the non-detergent rag to fully rinse it.

Then, allow the piece to air dry in an area with limited natural light. If it is a furniture piece, consider closing blinds or curtains while the piece is drying. Minimizing exposure to sunlight helps prevent cracking and separation of the leather pulp from the backing."

  "text":" Preparing the Leather Confirm the piece is bonded leather. Bonded leather and genuine leather are often cleaned in a similar fashion, but it is important to know what type of material you are working with for processes like spot treatments. Look at the tag on the piece to help you determine whether it is made of bonded or genuine leather. Remove large debris. Before you start cleaning bonded leather, pick up any large debris including items like rocks, coins, food crumbs, or any other sizeable object that may have settled into the piece.
