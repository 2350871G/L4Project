  "text":" Vegetable Risotto Saut\u00e9 one chopped small white onion in 2 tbsp. of butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. The saucepan should be 2-3 quarts large. Cook the onion and stir it occasionally with a wooden spoon until it appears translucent. Pour 1.5 cups of Aroborio rice into the saucepan. Stir the rice to mix it in with the onions. Let the rice toast in the pan for a minute or two -- it will absorb the flavor from the onions. Heat 3 cups of chicken broth in a separate saucepan over medium heat. Heat it to a gentle simmer. Crumble 1/4 tbsp. of saffron threads into the broth. Use a ladle to add a cup or two of simmering broth to the rice. Then, stir the rice until it has absorbed the broth. Keep adding broth to the rice and stirring; this cooking technique helps bring the starch out of the rice to combine with the broth for the creamy texture typical of a classic risotto. Add about 3/4 of the broth to the risotto. Cook the risotto for 15-20 minutes. Then, start tasting the risotto between additions of broth to see if it's done. When it's done, the individual rice grains should still be distinguishable, and their texture should be slightly firm (al dente), but not at all crunchy. Add the remaining ingredients to the risotto. Add 1 tbsp. of butter, 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup of cooked string beans, 1/4 cup of cooked peas, and 1/4 cup of cooked Portobello mushrooms to the risotto. Add salt and pepper to taste. The risotto should be rich, creamy, fragrant, and a beautiful golden color. Serve.
