  "text":" Using Cable Cutters Adjust the blade depth of the cutters. When you purchase your cable, there should be a label that tells you the depth of the armor. Use the dial on the side or top of your cutters to adjust them to the correct depth. Measure the length of cable you need. It's best to measure a few times to make sure you're absolutely correct. Then use a permanent marker to mark the armor at the correct length. Make another mark 6 in (15 cm) to left of the first mark. This mark shows you where you should begin using the cable cutters. This way, you'll have about 6 in (15 cm) of exposed wire to feed into the junction box. Place the cable in the cable guide of the cutter. Under the blade of the cable cutters, you'll see an open space that should be about the width of the cable. This is where you insert the cable so that the blade can come down and cut it. Align the second mark you made with the handle of the cutter. The handle is right where the blade will come down inside the cable guide. Line up the mark that's 6 in (15 cm) from your measurement mark with the handle of the cutters. Some blade cutters will have small arrows above the cable guide to show you where to line up your mark. If your cutters have this arrow, line up your mark using it. Tighten the screw on the bottom of the cutters. At the bottom of the cutters, you'll see a thumbscrew that you can rotate up into the cable guide. Once your cable is in the cable guide and lined up, turn the screw to the right until it pushes up against the bottom of the cable and secures it in the guide. Rotate the handle once. If you have the depth of your cable cutter properly set, you'll only need 1 revolution of the handle to cut through the armor. Rotate the handle slowly, completing 1 rotation. Unscrew the thumbscrew and remove the cable. Once you've cut through the cable, unscrew the bottom thumbscrew until the cable is loose in the cable guide. Then remove the cable from the cutters. Remove the waste armor. When you take the cable out of the cutters, the armor to the right of where you made the cut should be loose. Slide this armor off of the cable, exposing about 6 in (15 cm) of wire for you to feed into your junction box. Cutting Armored Cable with Side Cutters Measure your cable and mark it for cutting. It's best to measure a couple of times to make sure you have it exactly right. Then use a permanent marker to mark the armor where you need to make your cut. Bend the cable where you want to make the cut. Place your hands on either side of your mark. Then push down on both sides, causing the cable to bend at the mark. Once you have the beginning of a bend, take the cable in one hand and squeeze it until the coils begin to come apart. Insert a diagonal cutter into the opening of the armor. You may not have a lot of room to get the cutters under the armor at first. Insert as much of the tip of the cutter into the opening as you can. Then gently work it back and forth until enough of the cutter is in to cut through the armor. Cut off the excess armor. Once you have one side of your side cutters under the armor, begin cutting. You should cut around the edge of the armor, staying near the measurement mark. Slide off the waste piece. Once you've cut through the armor, the piece of armor you don't need will be loose on the wires. Slide the waste piece of armor down along the wires until it comes completely off. Cut the wires to length. If you're cutting down a large piece of cable to length, you'll also need to cut the wires. Measure how much wire you need, starting at the edge of the remaining armor. Then use the side cutters to gently cut through the wires at your measurement mark. Trim the sharp ends of the remaining armor. Leaving sharp ends can cause injury when you're installing the cable or are making repairs. Use side cutters to gently cut away the excess metal to create a smooth edge. If you can't get a smooth edge with the cutters, you can use a metal file to gently file the edges until they're smooth. Just be sure you don't file the cables. Using a Saw Blade as a Less Ideal Option Mark your cable for cutting. It's best to measure your cable a few times. Make sure you're sure about how much length you need. Then mark where you want to cut the armor. Bend the cable at the mark. Place your hands on either side of the mark you made. Then push down on either side of the mark, creating a bend in the armor at the mark. As you bend the cable, the armor should pop open. Place a saw blade at a 45-degree angle to the armor and begin sawing. You should place the saw blade on the armor where it's beginning to pop up. Then gently pull the blade back and forth across the armor until it just cuts through. Be careful not to cut through the wires. Rotate the cable so you can cut through the other side. Once you've sawed through the armor on 1 side, flip the cable over. Then saw through the armor on the other side, being careful not to cut through the wires. Remove the excess armor. Once you've cut completely through the armor, you'll have excess armor to the right of your cut. Slide the excess armor off, exposing the wires. Remove the jagged edges of the remaining armor. Using a metal file, gently sand down the edge of the armor where you made the cut. This will help you prevent injury when you're installing the cable or making repairs.",
