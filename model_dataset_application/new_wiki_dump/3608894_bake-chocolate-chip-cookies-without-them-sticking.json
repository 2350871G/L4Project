      "description":"In the case of a \"pan-sticker\", use a very thin spatula to slice beneath the cookies and lift them in one piece. Don't use a knife unless you're using parchment paper, in which case a cleaver is the perfect choice for getting burnt cookies up. Get as much of the cookie up as you can. If you don't use paper, stick the pan in the sink and wet one side at a time. Drizzle dishwashing soap on the wet side, and use either a dishcloth or scrubbing brush to loosen the remains, then, rinse off the chunks of cookie with the sprayer nozzle."
