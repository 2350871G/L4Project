  "text":" Easy felt circles bow Prepare the felt pieces first. Cut out two round pieces of felt. Make one piece a little smaller than the other. The circle sizes depend on how large you'd like the bow to be, but a good size would be about 10cm or 4 inches diameter. Place the large circle down on the work surface. Put the smaller circle on top of it. Pinch at the center. Take both fingers and pull inward from both edges of the top and bottom of the circle. This will cinch the bow shape together. Stitch it to hold permanently. Glue a hair clip or barrette slide to the back of the bow. Cut a length of ribbon and glue along the exposed clip, to cover it and make the clip more comfortable against the head when worn. Allow to set before adding the next features. Cut a length of black velvet ribbon. Fold it into a bow with long tails. Glue the black velvet ribbon bow to the center join of the felt bow. Allow to dry. If you like, the ribbon can be tied around the center, over the clip piece, for added strength. Remove the shank from the button that will form the bow's centerpiece. Use pliers to snap it off. Glue the button to the dead center of the felt bow, on top of the center of the black velvet ribbon bow. Allow to dry. Done. The felt bow is now ready to wear and enjoy. Easy rectangle felt bow Cut a rectangle from a piece of felt. The size is up to how large you wish the bow to be, but for a suggestion, try a rectangle measuring 7.5cm x 5cm (3 inches by 2 inches). Fold the short sides of the felt rectangle inward, to meet at the middle. Glue the end pieces in place, at the join. Allow to dry fully. Have the folded side facing upward. Using your fingers, pinch the rectangle in the middle, to cinch it in. Add glue into the folds to hold the cinched middle in place. Then turn the bow over and add glue in the middle of the front side. Allow to completely dry. Cut a small strip of felt for the crossover piece. This can be in the exact same color, or a contrasting color, whichever you prefer. Wrap the small strip of felt around the middle of the bow, to cover the join. The join of the strip must meet at the back, so that it won't be seen. Glue the strip into place and allow to dry. Glue to the hair clip or slide, with the back facing onto the hair clip. Allow to dry. Wear the bow. It's easy but pretty, so enjoy your homemade felt bow. Once you've got the hang of this, why not make a whole lot more? Double felt hair bow Lay a rectangle of felt in one color down on your work surface. The size of the rectangle is up to you; the width of the rectangle determines the length of the bow. Cut another rectangle that is slight smaller than the first rectangle. Use a contrasting color for this piece, for example, the first piece could be black, and the second piece white. Glue the smaller rectangle to the larger rectangle. Ensure that the outer border is the exact same measurement on all four sides. Allow to dry. Pinch in at the center of the rectangle. This draws both rectangles into a cinched form in the middle. Wrap florists wire around this, or glue or stitch in place. Cut a strip of felt.
