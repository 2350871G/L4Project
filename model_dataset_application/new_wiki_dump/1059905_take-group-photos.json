For example, if there is a light source behind the photo\u2019s subjects, the people will appear darker and less visible than if you position the picture so that the light is behind the camera instead. You also want to make sure that there is something you want to commemorate in the background of the photo, rather than something unappealing."

Make sure you can see everyone\u2019s faces and that there aren\u2019t any unwanted items in the background. If you\u2019re having trouble fitting everyone in the screen, it might be a good idea to try using a selfie stick."

          "description":"Selfie sticks allow you to capture more in the screen of the camera because it helps you hold the camera further away from your body. This means that you can fit more people into a group shot, or you can capture some cool scenery in the background behind your group shot. Either way, if you are having trouble fitting everything in because your arm just isn\u2019t long enough, try using a selfie stick. With most selfie sticks, your phone fits into a slot on the end and connects wirelessly (usually through Bluetooth) to the selfie stick. This allows you to use a button on the end of the selfie stick that you hold to take the photo, while your phone is too far away to physically reach the button."

This problem gets exponentially worse when people don\u2019t know when the exact moment of the picture will be. If you know your camera takes the photo after five seconds, you need to count out loud to five so everyone can be prepared.
