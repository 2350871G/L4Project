This way, if you break the yolk, you've only lost one egg instead of ruining a whole bowl of whites. The faster method is to crack all the eggs into one bowl and lift out the yolks one by one. It's best to leave this until you've had some practice, since one broken yolk will ruin all your whites."

If you have trouble with shell fragments in your egg, try cracking it against a flat countertop instead of the edge of the bowl. If a bit of shell falls into your egg, pick it out with your fingers, without breaking the yolk. It's easier to get it out with half of the shell, but that increases the risk of salmonella contamination."
