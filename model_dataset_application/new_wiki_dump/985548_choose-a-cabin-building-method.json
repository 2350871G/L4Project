          "description":"Do you have the time to take a couple of weeks to assemble a cabin kit? When fully assembled log cabins are very competitively priced with the kit packages you can purchase, and often times priced even better. Did you know the average cost in America to build a Log cabin ranges from a conservative estimate of $100 per square foot to an unbelievable $240 per square foot. The cost per square foot for a fully assembled unit averages out at about $65 per square foot. Take a minute and do a \u201cGoogle\u201d search for \u201ccost of a log home\u201d, and see for yourself the cost to build a log home. Many times you don't have the necessary extra set 3-4 sets of hands necessary to assemble portions of the kit. If your building site isn't precisely level, the precut lumber doesn't fit, or if you place one piece wrong you fight everything the rest of the way, and sometimes a piece will be cut wrong at the factory, a mistake that wasn't even yours. Couple that with the fact that very few people have ever assembled a kit, and have yet to face the frustrations of doing it themselves or finding someone to do it for them. You've probably assembled things with missing pieces, and had things that just would not go together, and the box always reads easy assembly, but really, is there anything more frustrating?"
