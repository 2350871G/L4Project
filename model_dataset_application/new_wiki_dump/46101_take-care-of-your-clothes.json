          "description":"This seems intuitive, but it's more difficult than most people think. Sort laundry based on cleaning instructions, type of laundry, and color.Make sure that you are only washing dirty clothes, as unnecessary washing of clean clothes can shorter their life. Set aside any dry-clean only articles of clothing. Group together any delicates or cold-wash only clothing. Group towels and heavy linens. Separate the rest of your clothes into whites and dark or colored groups. Turn T-shirts inside out to prevent the outside from wearing out and fading. This is especially important with graphic tees."

If yours does not, follow cleaning instructions on the tags of your clothes and follow a few guidelines. Delicates and cold-wash only clothing need cold water and a gentle spin cycle. Towels and linens can generally tolerate a warmer temperature and heavy spin cycle. Whites will get cleanest using hot water, making it ideal unless any whites are not pre-shrunk. Hot water can cause some color bleeding for dark or bright colors, so use warm or cold water."

If you live in a less ideal climate or don't have space, you'll need to opt for an automatic dryer. Hanging items to dry prevents them from shrinking. If you have the time, drying in natural sunlight and air is usually best. Sunlight is a natural disinfectant, and drying outdoors is both eco-friendly and will save you money."
