Place the pieces of potato into a large skillet (at least 12-inches in size). For a healthier breakfast skillet, consider substituting sweet potatoes for the baby potatoes."

Cook the potatoes over low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally until they're tender when you poke them with a knife. For seasoning, just sprinkle these over your potatoes and adjust the flavorings to your taste:\nSmoked paprika\nGarlic powder\nSalt\nBlack pepper\nFresh thyme, stemmed and chopped\nFresh rosemary, stemmed and chopped"

Chop 1 large red bell pepper and 1/2 of a large white onion into large chunks. Place these in a separate bowl. Slice 10 to 12 white mushrooms and add them to the bowl with the onion and pepper. You can use any type of sausage that you like. To speed cooking time, choose a sausage that's already fully cooked."

          "description":"Heat another large saute pan or skillet over medium heat. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the pan. Once the oil starts shimmering, add your sliced sausage and saute it until it browns. Add the chopped vegetables and cook them until they're tender, about 10 minutes. For extra flavor, you can add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and 1 to 2 tablespoons of maple syrup."

          "description":"Consider which of your skillets is larger and transfer the food from the smaller skillet into the larger one. For example, if the skillet that has your sausage and veggies is larger, transfer the potatoes into it and stir them in. If you're worried your skillet won't hold all of the potatoes, sausage, and cooked vegetables, transfer all of the ingredients to a large mixing bowl to stir them together. You can divide them between your smaller skillets to finish cooking them."

          "headline":"Add and cook the eggs.",
          "description":"Determine how many eggs you want to cook in your breakfast skillet. Make a small well for each egg you'll be cooking by scooting aside the potato/vegetable/sausage mixture. Crack the eggs and drop each one into a separate well. Bake the breakfast skillet in a 400 degree F oven for 10 minutes. The egg whites should be set before you can serve the breakfast skillet. Depending on how well you like your eggs cooked, try cooking the breakfast skillet for 8 to 10 minutes. If you'd like to scramble the eggs, just crack them into the skillet and stir them constantly as they cook. It should only take 4 or 5 minutes until they're scrambled and set. Serve the breakfast skillet with hot sauce, maple syrup, or ketchup."

If you're serving more than a few people, it's important to pick a base that is filling and will easily feed several people. You can cook diced or cubed potatoes as the base of your skillet.

If you'd like to stick to a vegetarian breakfast skillet, just use eggs or tofu. To add eggs, you can just make wells in the veggies and crack the eggs into each well. You could also drop the eggs into the skillet and stir them frequently while the skillet cooks. This will scramble the eggs. If you'd like to top the breakfast skillet with fried eggs, try frying the eggs in a separate pan. This way, you can cook them exactly how you like them and simply place them on top of your cooked breakfast skillet."

If you'd like your eggs cracked onto the top and cooked till just set, consider covering the skillet with a lid and cooking the skillet over medium-low heat until the whites set. This could take 5 to 10 minutes. If you'd like to use more than 4 eggs or would like them cooked more thoroughly, bake the breakfast skillet in an oven heated to 400 degrees F (204 C) for 10 minutes. If baking in the oven, ensure your pan is oven-safe. If you chose to scramble the eggs into the cooked vegetables and base, you won't need to continue cooking the breakfast skillet any further."
