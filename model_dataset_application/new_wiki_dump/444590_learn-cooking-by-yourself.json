You can change these basics to suit your needs. If you plan to make small amounts of food, for instance, you can probably get by with a single pan that has high walls, rather than a separate stock pot."

Never allow raw meats to touch other foods, for instance, and always clean your cooking surfaces after you\u2019ve cooked to prevent bacteria growth and cross-contamination. Prepare your meat separately from any other food items. This means using a different knife, a different cutting board, and even a different countertop or surface. Although vegetables and fruits do not pose as high a risk, you should still sanitize surfaces that have come into contact with them. The presence of food particles indicates the possible presence of unwanted mold and bacteria."

          "description":"Although it may be tempting to make alterations or substitutions as you cook, follow all of your recipes exactly as written. When cooking, there are many chemical reactions and flavor interactions that go into making a dish excellent. Until you fully understand how these chemical processes work, and feel comfortable mixing your own flavors, adhere to the recipe. Later in your cooking career, you can improvise and add to (or detract from) dishes, but you must master the basics first both to refine your tasting palate and to develop an instinct for cooking.

Alex Hong\t\t\tExecutive Chef & Restaurant Owner\t\t\t\tExpert Story: \"I started off by learning the basics and getting them down perfectly before I tried any harder, more advanced dishes. This is stuff like seasoning your food for different cuisines, like Italian or Asian-inspired, or making a perfect salad dressing, or learning how to roast a chicken properly.

          "description":"Breakfast dishes are often some of the simplest ones, and the recipes hardest to mess up on. You can start with making different types of eggs, for instance, move on to basic pancake and waffle recipes, and gradually move up to baking and more complicated recipes. Making your own breakfast will also help you develop the habit of eating breakfast each day, which is proven to help in weight management and staying alert throughout the day."

A grilled cheese, for instance, lends itself to experimentation with different cheeses, fruits and vegetables, and types of bread. To build confidence, practice making simple, easy dishes more decadent and unique. Although you don\u2019t want to become too reliant upon shortcuts, simple shortcuts such as using pre-made pesto, or pre-made salsa can keep you from becoming too stressed or overwhelmed to continue learning to cook at home. When you find something you like, you can look up a recipe and practice making it yourself without pressure."

Start with something simple, like vegetable broth, and gradually work your way up to harder soups and stews, such as broccoli and cheese soup. Soups and stews are both excellent for days when you don\u2019t have a lot of time to cook. You can place all of your items into a large crock pot, turn it on low, and let it sit overnight or throughout the day, and return to a ready-made dinner in the evening."

For breakfast, open the blinds, turn on some music or a podcast, and prepare a cup of coffee or tea. For lunch, you might set your plate next to a cloth napkin, and sit down to eat and ruminate.
