Preventing Rust Keep metallic items away from water. For example, do not leave garden tools sitting in the rain. Keep some pieces of charcoal or chalk in your toolbox.

Clean saw blades, garden snips/cutters, etc., after use to remove soil, dust, wooden shavings, etc. Then wipe with a little oil or WD-40 to help discourage rust. Bring garden furniture indoors during the colder, wet months. Cover it when it is not in use. This may help to discourage the growth of rust. Do not wash cast iron or tinware in the dishwasher.

Always ensure such items are fully dried before placing into a cupboard, the garage or anywhere else for storage.
