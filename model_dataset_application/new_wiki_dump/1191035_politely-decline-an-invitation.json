          "description":"If invited to a wedding or another event for which an RSVP card is included, return the RSVP promptly. If you immediately know that you cannot or will not attend the event, let the host know right away not to expect you. If the invitation came without a RSVP card, look on the invitation for the preferred method of contacting the host. Send \"regrets\" for written invitations within a week. Don't give the impression that you may come if you know you won't. Stringing the host along as they prepare for their event will frustrate them. If you are not sure whether or not you can attend, call the host to explain your dilemma and ask when they need a solid answer. If you plan to attend but must be late, ask the host if that is ok. If the event includes a seated meal, it may not be possible to show up at anytime. However, your host may suggest you come at the conclusion of dinner before dancing begins. If no RSVP is requested, still call or write to the host with your regrets and thank them for including you. It is considered rude to ignore an invitation completely. \u201cRegrets only\u201d is often an option included on formal RSVP cards. If you do not send the card back, you are agreeing to attend."

          "description":"Thank the host for the invitation, say you will not be able to make it, and wish them luck with their event. You might also tell them you would love to see them another time, if appropriate. Just don\u2019t change your response! It\u2019s important to stick to your original decision. The type of note should match the type of invitation sent. For a wedding or bridal shower, send a formal card or use nice looking stationery. Never send a typed response to a personal invitation. Unless even your address on the envelope was typewritten, your host put time and effort into your invitation and you should do the same. Find examples of polite declines online if you are not sure what to say, but be sure to change the wording to fit your particular circumstances or manner of speaking. Don\u2019t get caught plagiarizing an example you found instead of taking time to write a sincere note."
