          "description":"The foaming bubbles created by boiling water are filled with steam. If they touch something at a temperature below 100 \u00b0C (212 \u00b0F), the steam will condense (change back into a liquid) and break the surface tension of the bubbles. A wooden spoon is the best choice because a plastic spoon might melt and a metal spoon will get very hot to the touch."

Just squeeze out the amount you need right onto the griddle when making pancakes. Use a kitchen funnel to make it easier to pour the batter into the bottle.

Just plug in the hair straightener, let it heat up, and clamp it over each side of your shirt collar for about 15 seconds. To play it safe, don\u2019t do this while you\u2019re wearing the shirt! This is a great hack if you\u2019re going to wear a sweater over your dress shirt anyway\u2014why bother ironing the whole thing?"

          "description":"If you splash some red wine on your white shirt, grab some white wine! Dampen a clean cloth in white wine and gently blot the red wine stain until it becomes less noticeable. It won\u2019t remove the stain completely, but it does a surprisingly good job. If you have a stain remover stick or wipes with you, use them\u2014they work even better.

          "description":"Instead of relying on elbow grease alone to scrub a tub or toilet, let your drill do the hard work! Look for different types of scrub brush attachments where cleaning supplies are sold. Set the drill to its lowest speed first, then increase it as needed. Follow the brush attachment\u2019s instructions carefully. Don\u2019t use the attachment to clean fiberglass, laminate, wood, stone, or other surfaces unless the brush is specifically marketed for that purpose."

          "headline":"Use a clean dustpan to fill a bucket that won\u2019t fit under the sink.",
          "description":"Place the bucket on the floor directly in front of the sink. Place the larger end of the dustpan under the faucet so that the pan\u2019s handle is resting over the front edge of the sink. When you turn on the water it will flow through the channel in the handle, go over the edge, and fall like a waterfall into the bucket. Have some towels handy the first few times you try this. It may take a bit of practice to get the placement and water flow just right."

          "description":"Hang or attach the shoe hanger to the back of a closet or pantry door, then fill the pockets with your cleaning bottles.

          "description":"When painting a room, stir in 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of vanilla extract per 1 US gal (3.8 L) of paint. The vanilla will mask the unpleasant odor of the paint. Essential oils like peppermint work as well. This hack doesn\u2019t work on oil-based paint, since the vanilla extract or other essential oil creates a solution with the oils in the paint\u2014which may negate the pleasant scent you\u2019re aiming for or make the paint smell even worse. The oils aren\u2019t soluble with water-based paint, though, so they remain separate and help mask the paint odor."

When bathtime is done, just drain the tub and lift out the basket with all the toys inside! This is not a substitute for an infant bath basin.

The small humps created by the noodles will make it less likely that your child will roll off the edge of the bed. Use this as a short-term measure for an occasional problem.

Trace around both their feet, either barefoot or with socks on. If the shoes you\u2019re looking at are larger (but not too much larger) than the traced outlines, the shoes will fit\u2014at least for a few months!"

To protect these sensitive areas, pull apart several old, dried up pens and pick out the springs inside. Wrap the springs around the ends of the cables to give them more protection while still letting them flex somewhat."

          "description":"This is a great hack if your desk is cluttered with several charger cables, printer cables, ethernet cables, and so on. Choose binder clips that are large enough to clip to the edge of the desk, but also small enough (if possible) to keep the head of each cable from falling through the binder clip opening. If you can\u2019t fit the head of a cord through the binder clip wires, squeeze the sides of each wire to remove them from the clip. Then, squeeze them again to put them back in place after you\u2019ve pulled the head of the cord through."

Instead, buy a large carabiner clip at a hardware, outdoor, or sporting goods store. Clip both handles of each bag into the carabiner, then carry everything more comfortably by holding onto the carabiner."

Snack chips are made almost entirely of 2 components\u2014hydrocarbons and fats\u2014that burn readily, so you\u2019ll be surprised how quickly and easily they go up in flames.

Clean and dry the bottle thoroughly, making sure to get rid of the oily residue on the inside. Then, stick things like your ID and cash inside it.

Feed the open end of the bread bag up through the cut opening and out of the mouth of the bottle, then fold it down over the sides of the mouth. Screw on the bottle\u2019s lid to make an airtight seal. Use plastic lids as simple but effective coasters. Don't have a coaster on hand? A plastic lid from a mayonnaise jar or similar container can do the job! Just place your drink on top and you've got a neat coaster. Clothing Hacks Make canvas shoes water-resistant by applying beeswax. Use a clean rag to spread the beeswax over the entire outer surface of the shoes, making sure not to miss any areas. Then, wave a hairdryer over the shoes until the wax melts and becomes invisible. Apply another coat of beeswax whenever you notice the water-resistant coating begin to falter. Iron a dress shirt collar fast with a hair straightener iron. This is a quick fix that saves time versus getting out your iron and board. Just plug in the hair straightener, let it heat up, and clamp it over each side of your shirt collar for about 15 seconds. To play it safe, don\u2019t do this while you\u2019re wearing the shirt! This is a great hack if you\u2019re going to wear a sweater over your dress shirt anyway\u2014why bother ironing the whole thing? Use white wine to reduce the appearance of a red wine stain. If you splash some red wine on your white shirt, grab some white wine! Dampen a clean cloth in white wine and gently blot the red wine stain until it becomes less noticeable. It won\u2019t remove the stain completely, but it does a surprisingly good job. If you have a stain remover stick or wipes with you, use them\u2014they work even better. If you left them at home, use them on the stain before washing the garment. Prevent lost socks by pinning pairs before washing and drying. Stop feeding single socks to the \u201cdryer monster\u201d by outwitting it! Simply secure each pair of socks together with a safety pin before putting them into the wash. Keep them pinned together when you transfer them to the dryer. Replace any pins that start to show signs of rusting. Housekeeping Hacks Screw a magazine holder onto the back of a cabinet door to hold a hairdryer. Choose a magazine/file holder made of plastic, wood, metal wire, or sturdy cardboard and secure it in place with 2-4 screws. Most standard hairdryers fit perfectly into this spot. Alternatively, use several removable adhesive strips instead of screws. Use coat hooks instead of rods to hang towels in a small bathroom. These take up much less space, since each hook can hold 2 large towels. The towels may also dry faster than if you use towel rods that are stacked one in front of the next. Apply magnetic strips behind cabinet doors to store personal care items. Buy peel-and-stick magnetic strips, or use removable adhesive strips to secure the magnets in place. Use the magnetic strips to hold tweezers, bobby pins, cosmetic brushes, and other magnetic objects. Check to see how many of your personal care items are magnetic before trying this. Buy a scrub brush attachment for your drill to clean tile and ceramic. Instead of relying on elbow grease alone to scrub a tub or toilet, let your drill do the hard work! Look for different types of scrub brush attachments where cleaning supplies are sold. Set the drill to its lowest speed first, then increase it as needed. Follow the brush attachment\u2019s instructions carefully. Don\u2019t use the attachment to clean fiberglass, laminate, wood, stone, or other surfaces unless the brush is specifically marketed for that purpose. Use a clean dustpan to fill a bucket that won\u2019t fit under the sink. Place the bucket on the floor directly in front of the sink. Place the larger end of the dustpan under the faucet so that the pan\u2019s handle is resting over the front edge of the sink. When you turn on the water it will flow through the channel in the handle, go over the edge, and fall like a waterfall into the bucket. Have some towels handy the first few times you try this. It may take a bit of practice to get the placement and water flow just right. Paint your keys with nail polish to color-code them. This is a great hack if you have a bunch of similar-looking keys on your key ring. Gel nail polish adheres best to metal keys, but any type of polish will do. Store your household cleaners conveniently in a shoe hanger. Hang or attach the shoe hanger to the back of a closet or pantry door, then fill the pockets with your cleaning bottles. Choose a shoe hanger with mesh or clear plastic pockets so you can easily differentiate the cleaning bottles. If you have a hanging rod in the closet, get a shoe hanger with hooks. For safety, add a lock to the door if there are kids around. Try different home remedies to remove permanent marker. Different DIY removers may work better for different materials. Give the following a try:\nFor fabric, try hand sanitizer. For your skin or for wood surfaces, try rubbing alcohol. For painted walls, try hairspray or toothpaste. For ceramic or glass, mix 1 part white toothpaste and 1 part baking soda. Soak a crusty paintbrush in vinegar for 30 minutes to ease cleaning. After 30 minutes, use a wire brush or paintbrush cleaner to remove the loosened paint. Then, wash the brush with soap and water, rinse it, and let it air dry. If you heat the vinegar to nearly boiling in a pot on the stove, you can reduce the soaking time to 10 minutes. Reduce the odor of water-based paint with vanilla extract. When painting a room, stir in 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of vanilla extract per 1 US gal (3.8 L) of paint. The vanilla will mask the unpleasant odor of the paint. Essential oils like peppermint work as well. This hack doesn\u2019t work on oil-based paint, since the vanilla extract or other essential oil creates a solution with the oils in the paint\u2014which may negate the pleasant scent you\u2019re aiming for or make the paint smell even worse. The oils aren\u2019t soluble with water-based paint, though, so they remain separate and help mask the paint odor. Childcare Hacks Use a rubber band to keep kids from locking a door. Loop the rubber band over one door knob, make a figure eight over the latch, then loop the free end of the rubber band over the other door knob. Choose a thick, sturdy rubber band that is stretched taut when positioned this way. Make a smaller \u201claundry basket play tub\u201d within your bathtub. Place a standard rectangular laundry basket into the tub as you fill it with water. Put your toddler or small child into the basket, along with their toys. When bathtime is done, just drain the tub and lift out the basket with all the toys inside! This is not a substitute for an infant bath basin. Use it only for kids who are big enough to bathe in a standard tub. Supervise children at all times while bathing. Create a child safety bead-bracelet with your phone number on it. Buy a container of colorful bracelet beads and let your child help you thread them onto the bracelet string. Pick out numbered beads and string them on so that they correspond to your phone number. You might also want to spell out the child\u2019s first name. A bracelet is no substitute for proper supervision of a child. Use pool noodles to help keep a kid from rolling out of bed. Lay a foam pool noodle along each long edge of the bed, right on top of the mattress. Tuck the fitted sheet over the mattress so that the noodles are held securely in place. The small humps created by the noodles will make it less likely that your child will roll off the edge of the bed. Use this as a short-term measure for an occasional problem. Invest in proper bed rails if your child rolls out of bed frequently. Trace a kid\u2019s feet on paper when you\u2019re shoe shopping without them. Instead of having to guess whether a pair of shoes will fit, bring their feet (or at least a tracing of them) with you. Trace around both their feet, either barefoot or with socks on. If the shoes you\u2019re looking at are larger (but not too much larger) than the traced outlines, the shoes will fit\u2014at least for a few months! Use paper cupcake or muffin wrappers to catch drips from frozen treats. Poke the bottom of the wooden stick of your kid\u2019s favorite frozen treat\u2014like a Popsicle or ice cream bar\u2014through the bottom of the paper wrapper. Slide the wrapper up to the base of the treat and let it catch all the inevitable drips! Paper wrappers with foil on the outside work best, but any paper wrapper will do. Tech and Home Office Hacks Seal your tablet in a zip-close bag if you like to read in the tub. Use a clear, 1 US gal (3.8 L) bag with a secure zip closure. Test the bag first by sealing a piece of paper inside and submerging it for 1 minute. If the paper is dry, your tablet should stay dry too! Play it safe and do your best to keep your tablet dry regardless. Don\u2019t try to read underwater! Use springs from used pens to strengthen the ends of charger cables. Charger cables tend to kink, bend, and break right near the ends (where they plug into the wall or your device). To protect these sensitive areas, pull apart several old, dried up pens and pick out the springs inside. Wrap the springs around the ends of the cables to give them more protection while still letting them flex somewhat. Organize cords at the edge of your desk with binder clips. This is a great hack if your desk is cluttered with several charger cables, printer cables, ethernet cables, and so on. Choose binder clips that are large enough to clip to the edge of the desk, but also small enough (if possible) to keep the head of each cable from falling through the binder clip opening. If you can\u2019t fit the head of a cord through the binder clip wires, squeeze the sides of each wire to remove them from the clip. Then, squeeze them again to put them back in place after you\u2019ve pulled the head of the cord through. Organize cords using empty toilet paper tubes in a shoebox. For a smaller cord, stand a toilet paper tube up in the box and feed the cord down into the tube. For a larger cord, use the toilet paper tube as a sleeve and slide it over the cord once you\u2019ve looped it around itself several times. Stand your phone upright in a cup, glass, or mug to amplify the volume. If you tend to sleep through your alarm even when it\u2019s set to high volume, give this hack a try. Put the phone\u2019s speaker (which is usually at the bottom) into the bottom of the cup and get ready for a much louder sound! You can use this trick to amplify music, but it may take some trial and error to find a cup, glass, or mug that doesn\u2019t distort the sound of your favorite tunes. Use a cassette tape case as a cheap but sturdy phone stand. Try this hack if you find some old cassette tapes (with their cases) in the attic. Open the case\u2019s lid as far as it will go, then lay the case front-side down on your table or desk. The slot in the lid will hold your phone at a great viewing angle. Some larger smartphones may not fit into the slot. Miscellaneous Hacks Carry multiple plastic bags at once with a large carabiner clip. The problem with carrying several plastic shopping bags at once isn\u2019t that they\u2019re too heavy, but that the handles dig into your hands. Instead, buy a large carabiner clip at a hardware, outdoor, or sporting goods store. Clip both handles of each bag into the carabiner, then carry everything more comfortably by holding onto the carabiner. Use snack chips as kindling to help start a fire. Light a loose pile of snack chips on fire, then slowly add wood to build up your campfire. Snack chips are made almost entirely of 2 components\u2014hydrocarbons and fats\u2014that burn readily, so you\u2019ll be surprised how quickly and easily they go up in flames. Cheesy tortilla chips (like Doritos) work great here, but any type of fried snack chip will do the job. Make sure not to eat all your kindling beforehand! Hide your valuables on the beach in an empty sunscreen bottle. Your best option is a bottle with a rounded rectangular shape and a large flip-top lid that also twists off. Clean and dry the bottle thoroughly, making sure to get rid of the oily residue on the inside. Then, stick things like your ID and cash inside it. Unless there is a sunscreen thief around, your stuff will stay safe! Alternatively, you can buy storage containers online that are made to look like real sunscreen bottles. Use your phone and a Gatorade (or similar) bottle to make a lantern. Turn on your phone\u2019s flashlight tool and lay it down so the light is shining straight up. Place the Gatorade bottle right on top of the light\u2014it\u2019s shape will diffuse the light and create a cool lantern. Full bottles work better than empty bottles, and liquids with light coloring (like yellow or pale blue) work better than clear liquids.",
