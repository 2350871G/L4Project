  "text":" The Cake Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius.  Prepare the pan. You will want one 9-inch by 2-inch cake or quiche pan or a 9-inch springform pan, greased, bottom lined with scroll or wax paper, and then re-oil again and floured. Mix, in a medium-sized bowl, 2 tablespoons cream, and vanilla.  Add the butter and leftover 6 tablespoons of cream.  Blend, by hand or by mixer, on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened. Amplify to medium speed (high speed if using a hand mixer) and whip for 1 1/2 minutes to ventilate and develop the cake's form. Scrape down the sides and slowly add the egg mixture in 3 batches, whisking for 20 seconds after each addition to blend the ingredients and strengthening the structure. Scrape down the sides. Abrade the batter into the prepared pan and press the surface with a spatula.  Bake the mixture for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a wire cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when pressed lightly in the center. The cake should be just starting to wither from the sides of the pan. It will shrink quite a bit while it is cooling. Allow the cake to cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. It will have a level top. Loosen the sides with a small metal spatula and invert onto a greased wire rack. The Pink Frosting Use an electric mixer to mix the butter on medium speed in a medium sized bowl until it is smooth, about 1 minute.  Add the remaining components and whisk on medium to high speed until smooth. If the icing is too thick to spread, blend in 1 teaspoon of milk. Continue adding milk 1 teaspoon at a time until desired consistency is obtained. Blend in food coloring if desired. Finished. ",
