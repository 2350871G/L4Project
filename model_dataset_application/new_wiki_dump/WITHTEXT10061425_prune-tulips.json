Either trim off only the brownish sections or cut the leaves at the base of the stem, based on personal preference. This encourages the plant to grow back next year. If you'd like, trim the leaves completely off leaving just the stems intact. The stems may shrink or wilt as winter strikes, but this way the plant will resurface in the spring. You can use garden shears or a sharp pair of scissors. If you trim the flowers at the end of June, you can cut the leaves in late July or early August."
