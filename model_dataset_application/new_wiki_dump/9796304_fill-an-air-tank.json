You can use the same pump motorists use to inflate the tires on their vehicles. Inspect your air tank for damage before filling it, and get a new one if you see any cracks or rust. You may also be able to get your tank filled at scuba shops, paintball locations, and some sporting goods stores. You can use your own air compressor.

It is next to the pressure gauge and usually made of brass, so it is hard to miss. Fit the hose\u2019s nozzle over the spout on the back end of the fitting. Attach the air hose directly to the spout. It should fit right over it with no space between them. Avoid placing the compressor hose where the tank\u2019s air hose attaches on the opposite end of the fitting."

The hose will usually have a trigger you need to pull to begin pumping air. The amount of time needed to fill the tank depends on the tank\u2019s size. Set aside about 20 minutes in order to fill the the tank completely. Keep the tank\u2019s valve closed. The air will still flow into it."
