By asking them to leave, you\u2019ll explicitly communicate the fact that they are indeed uninvited. Be firm. Let them know that you are serious. Say, for example, \u201cJohn, I\u2019d like you to leave by the end of the week.\u201d\nTry to be polite. For example, say \u201cWe\u2019ve really enjoyed having you stay with us, but its best for everyone if you move on to your next destination.\u201d\nIf the person refuses, you may need to resort to legal means."

This may help them to see that they are infringing on your space and decide to move on. For example, you could say something like, \u201cRemember when you first arrived and I said that I had a busy week ahead of me, but you assured me that you would only be here for the weekend?\u201d"

          "description":"A great way to get your guest to leave is to tell them that your life is getting in the way of being a good host to them. In the end, they may take the hint and pack their bags. Let them know that your work and family life are so busy that you can\u2019t be the type of host you want to be at the moment. They should consider visiting again in the future. Tell them that other house guests will be arriving soon. For example, let them know that your in-laws are coming to visit and need to stay in the room they are staying in. Say \u201cJohn, I\u2019m so sorry, but my in-laws are coming to stay for a week starting Friday, we\u2019ve got to have our guest room available to them.\u201d\nShare your plans to begin a home improvement project on the room they are staying in. For example, tell them you\u2019re about to convert it into a home office or a gym. If you\u2019re serious about it, you may even want to hire a contractor to go and take measurements of the space."

          "description":"One of the realities of hosting is that your guests will undoubtedly cost you money. Because of this, it seems obvious that you should request contributions of your guest if they overstay their welcome. However, if you just want them to leave then this might not be the best option. If you are okay with them staying longer if they help to cover the costs of their stay, then there are a couple of things you can try. Explain to them the cost of them staying. Detail the cost of extra water, power, and any other resources they are using. Set your nightly or weekly rate above low-cost alternatives. For example, if an extended stay charges $200 a week, you should ask $250. Understand that this might not work for some people, like parents or older relatives. Requesting money is best reserved for younger relatives, siblings, and children."

This should make a lot of sense, as someone who lives in a home should take part in taking care of the home. Some chores might include:\nLawncare\nTaking the trash out\nWashing dishes\nGeneral household cleaning."

While lying seems like a drastic step to take, you might need to do it to avoid an awful and uninvited house guest. Try to bend the truth instead of creating a big lie. You don't want to get caught in the middle of your own lie. For example, instead of saying one of your kids is deathly ill, say they have a very contagious cold. Use future plans to deter them from staying. For instance, if you plan on remodeling the house in six months, tell them you're about to start now. In the end, you can always tell them you pushed it back. Remember that the person will likely communicate with others that you know, so make sure you don't create a lie that you'll be caught in.
