Once you have these three things down, you'll be able to easily adapt and customize your curry to your own taste preferences. Simply mix and match ingredients into the following \"formula\" to get your own curry cooking:\n\nOnions/Garlic/Ginger: These three ingredients form the basis of most curries, but some Indians actually skip the garlic. The longer you cook these ingredients the richer and darker the curry will be. Generous Spices: Curries need big spoonfuls of spices, added early to cook and soften. There is no \"wrong\" combination of spices, so work on finding the mixtures you love. Thickening Agent: What is going to give your curry it's body? This is frequently one or more of the following -- yogurt, coconut milk, stock, water, pureed or diced tomatoes, chili paste, or spinach."

Curries are heavily spiced, but also heavily improvised, so feel free to try any combination of spices you'd like. For your first recipe, try 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) cumin and coriander, plus a pinch of asafoetida if you have it. Crackling means the seeds are hopping around in the pan, dancing."

Stir them in and cook for another 2-3 minutes. You want your spices to cook, but not burn. If there is not a lot of liquid in the pan from the onions and oil, mix the spices up with 2\u20133 tablespoons (29.6\u201344.4 ml) of water to rehydrate them and prevent burning.
