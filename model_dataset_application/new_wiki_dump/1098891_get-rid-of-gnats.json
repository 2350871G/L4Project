After scrubbing the drain, bring a pot of water to a near boil, then pour it down the drain to clear the debris you\u2019ve scraped.

Aside from enzymatic drain cleaners, you should avoid pouring chemicals down your drains. Bleach, ammonia, vinegar, and other household products can erode pipes, especially older cast iron pipes. Additionally, cleaning products can react with other chemicals in your pipes. A harmful reaction could produce dangerous fumes or pressure strong enough to burst a pipe.

Mix in a drop of dish soap to break the surface tension, which will help prevent trapped gnats from escaping. Leave the jar in an area you've seen gnats buzzing about, such as your kitchen or dining room. After you fill your can or jar, you could seal the lid and poke small holes in it with a nail or screw. That way, any gnats that don\u2019t drown in the vinegar can\u2019t escape. You could also cut a 2 liter (0.53 US gal) plastic bottle in half, and add vinegar to the bottom half. Place the top, or the part with the narrow nozzle, upside down into the base. It should look like a funnel when you're done. Gnats will follow the vinegar scent to find their way into the trap, but they'll have a hard time getting out through bottle's narrow top. If you don't have apple cider vinegar on hand, any type of vinegar will do. Other effective baits include beer or mashed banana."

However, on their own, traps aren\u2019t an effective way to manage an infestation. In order to eliminate gnats completely, you\u2019ll need to combat all stages of their life cycle. Traps only kill adult gnats; they do nothing to fight eggs or larvae."

While you shouldn\u2019t let your plants wilt or turn yellow, try to hold off watering until the soil is completely dry. To test the soil, stick your finger about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) into the surface. If dirt sticks to your finger, it\u2019s probably best to hold off watering, unless your plants look sad. It\u2019s also best to use containers with drainage holes in the bottom. If your pots sit on saucers that collect excess water, be sure to drain them after you water your plants.

Using a homemade soap spray increases the risk of leaf damage. It\u2019s wise to test the spray on a small area before spraying an entire plant.

Dig a hole in the center large enough to accommodate the roots, bury them, then cover them with soil.
