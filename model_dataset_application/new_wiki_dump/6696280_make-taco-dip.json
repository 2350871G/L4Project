Using an electric mixer set to medium-high speed, beat the three ingredients together for 1 to 2 minutes, or until evenly and smoothly combined. Note that the cream cheese must be softened to room temperature before you begin. The mixture will likely retain more lumps if you use cold cream cheese. You can use 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of homemade taco seasoning or one 1.25 oz (35 g) package of dry taco seasoning. For a \"skinny\" version of this dish, use reduced-fat cream cheese and sour cream instead of the full-fat versions."
