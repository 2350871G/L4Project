          "description":"Shoot-through umbrellas are ideal for shooting groups of people or larger areas. Shoot-through umbrellas are white so they allow light to pass through them. Tip: Photography umbrellas can be used with any light source, so you don\u2019t need to worry about what light source you are going to use when selecting an umbrella. A shoot-through umbrella will be positioned between your subject and the light source when shooting to diffuse the light before it reaches the subject."

These types of umbrellas can be used as both a shoot-through and a reflective umbrella and are ideal if you want to shoot a variety of subjects. Keep in mind that bigger umbrellas are also more versatile and give you more control than smaller ones. A 6\u20137 ft (1.8\u20132.1 m) umbrella will give you the most control over your lighting, but they are also harder to travel with and harder to open in smaller spaces."

This is especially important when you are shooting portraits. Tip: Smaller light sources create harsher light and shadows, whereas bigger light sources create softer light and shadows. You can play with the angles to create different shadow effects as well if you don\u2019t want to completely get rid of shadows."
