If you're having trouble finding the square footage, then it's probably because you're not working with a neat area with just one length and one width.

To find the square footage, or the area, of the entire space, you'll need to find the square footage of the individual spaces and then add them all together. Draw faint lines separating the different sections. Label them A, B, and C for your convenience. Measure the length and width of the first space. Using a ruler or measuring tape, find the length and width of the first space you've created, Space A. The length of the space is 12 feet (3.7 m), and the width is 15 feet (4.6 m). Multiply the length of the first space by the width of the first space. To find the square footage -- or the area -- of the space, just multiply the length times the width, just as you would do with any rectangle. Ex: 12 feet (3.7 m). x 15 feet (4.6 m). = 180 square feet Measure the length and width of the second space. Let's say that the length of Space B is 20 feet (6.1 m) and the width of Space B is 10 feet (3.0 m). Multiply the length of the second space times the width of the second space. This will lead you to find the square footage of the second space. Here's how you find the square footage of Space B:\nEx: 20 feet (6.1 m). x 10 feet (3.0 m). = 200 square feet. Measure the length and width of the third space. Let's say that the length of Space C is 20 feet (6.1 m) and the width of Space C is 35 feet (10.7 m). Multiply the length of the third space times the width of the third space. This will lead you to find the square footage of the third space. Here's how you find the square footage of Space C:\nEx: 20 feet (6.1 m). x 35 feet (10.7 m). = 700 square feet Add the square footages of the three spaces.
