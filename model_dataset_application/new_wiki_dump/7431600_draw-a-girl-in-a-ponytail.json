      "description":"Draw some lines that diverge from the general direction. Inside the ponytail, hair is going to flow in slightly different directions. Some hair will escape from the ponytail, especially over time and if the girl has been active. Common places for hair to escape include around the face (since this hair is farthest from the ring) and at the bottom of the hair line. A little messiness typically makes it prettier."
