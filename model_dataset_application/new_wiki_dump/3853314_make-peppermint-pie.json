Instead of chocolate sandwich cookies, you can use any crunchy cookie, including graham crackers, wafer cookies, or even shortbread cookies. If you don't have a food processor, place the cookies inside a sealable plastic bag and gently crush them up with a rolling pin or hammer."

When the cookies and butter have been combined, press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate. Use your fingers to pack the mixture down into the bottom and up against the sides of the pie plate to form a pie shell."

When it's done, remove it from the oven and allow the pie shell to cool to room temperature without removing it from the pie plate. Make sure the pie shell is completely cool before adding any filling, otherwise the filling will melt or become runny."

Set the bowl aside. As an alternative, you can also use a box of unsweetened vanilla pudding mix in place of the gelatin. This is a vegetarian option that will make the filling softer, but it won't set like the gelatin filling. To do this, whisk the pudding mix into the water and set it aside."

Continue heating the mixture until the peppermint candies have melted. When the candies have melted, remove the saucepan from the heat.

Fold in the peppermint mixture by gently stirring it into the whipping cream. Stir until the two are almost fully combined, but there's still a marbled effect with the pink peppermint mixture and the white whipping cream."

Place the pie in the refrigerator to chill and set for about two hours."

Making a Peppermint Ice Cream Pie Prepare your kitchen. Set your oven to 350 F (177 C) for the pie crust.
