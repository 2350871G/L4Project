          "description":"You\u2019re not going to get anywhere if deep down you don\u2019t really want to stop. The first thing you need to do, therefore, is recognize that you have an addiction and choose to not let it rule your life. Once you\u2019ve done that, the measures you take to win back control will actually have a shot at being successful. Making up your mind to quit gaming (or at least cut way back) is a lot less difficult if you consider the ways it\u2019s negatively impacting you. Think about how much time and energy you sacrifice to your habit, and how that sacrifice has stolen the enjoyment from other aspects of your life.Tip: Try telling someone else about your resolution, or writing it down on a piece of paper and keeping it somewhere where you\u2019ll see it every day. Announcing your goals in a formal way has a way of making them seem more official and therefore keeping you accountable."

          "description":"Note approximately how long you spend in front of the screen each day and make it a point to log off an hour early. If the thought of losing a whole hour doesn\u2019t sit well with you, start with half an hour or even 20 minutes and gradually decrease your play time as you get more comfortable until you no longer feel the need to play at all. This kind of progressive reduction will make it easier for you to adjust. Use the timer on your smartphone to keep track of how long you\u2019ve been playing and alert you when your allotted time is up. If you\u2019re a PC gamer, you can even set your computer to shut itself down at a specified time, which may be helpful if you\u2019re not sure you can pull the plug on your own. It could take weeks or even months to taper off your daily play time, and that's okay. The important thing is that you stick with it and fight the impulse to play for longer than your predetermined time frame."

          "description":"Tell a parent or a responsible sibling or roommate about your desire to play less (and eventually stop altogether). Ask them to check in with you every now and then at agreed-upon times to make sure that you\u2019re staying on track. You may respond better to pressure that\u2019s coming from an outside source. Tell your loved one to be as firm as they need to be, even if it means forcibly turning off your console or hiding your gaming equipment from you. If you often play with other gamers online or in-person, inform them of your intention to quit, as well. Hopefully, they'll be supportive of your decision, but if not, you'll at least be giving them a heads up that they may not be seeing as much of you."

          "description":"Make gaming a reward that you give yourself for being productive and completing your important daily duties. If you always hop on first thing in the morning, you run the risk of getting sucked into a prolonged session when you should be getting ready for work, school, or other responsibilities. It will be much easier to control your urge to play before you begin than after you\u2019ve already started. Be sure to apply your regular time limit to your evening sessions to keep yourself from staying up too late. Pulling an all-nighter will only make it harder to do what you need to do the next day."

It will require tremendous willpower, no doubt. Over time, however, it will get easier, to the point where video games no longer have the same hold over you that they once did. Anytime you're tempted to sit down and play, take it as a challenge to get stronger. Consciously saying no to unhealthy desires conditions the part of your brain that's responsible for regulating self-control. This approach may be simple, but it\u2019s not easy.

Bury your console under a pile of boxes in the garage, put it in the trunk of your car, or take it apart and hide each component in a different place. Do whatever it takes to keep yourself away.

Not only is this a generous act, it also helps you meet your goals. You can\u2019t spend too much time playing a game that you don\u2019t own!
