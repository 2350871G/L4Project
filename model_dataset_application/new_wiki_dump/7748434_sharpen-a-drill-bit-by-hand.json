Make sure that the drill bit fits snugly in the slot. It should fit right into the central groove in your jig. Then, place the tip of the drill bit near the grinding wheel.

Slide the sharpening jig back and forth with one hand as you hold the drill bit against the grinder with the other hand. You will also need to turn the drill bit slightly as you grind it down. Turn it clockwise slowly. It is important to make the edges as symmetrical as possible. Using a jig will make this much easier than grinding a drill bit free hand."

You can try out your newly sharpened drill bit on a scrap piece of wood, or even metal, to ensure that it is sharp. Keep in mind that if you are going to be drilling through metal, it is best to use a drill press. It takes a lot of pressure to drill through metal, even with a sharp drill bit, so a handheld drill may not be enough."
