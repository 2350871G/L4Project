  "text":" Preparing the Chicken Prepare the chicken meat. Cut off any fat, connective tissue and other waste. Cut the chicken into small chunks.  Toss the chicken pieces into a bowl. Add bread crumbs to the bowl. Start with a small amount. You may like to coat the chicken with flour and then raw egg before you try to make breadcrumbs stick to it. Toss the chicken and bread crumbs around in the bowl. The chicken pieces should be lightly covered in bread crumbs. Add some more bread crumbs if needed. Heat some cooking oil in a skillet pan on medium heat.  Add the chicken to the pan and fry the chicken until it's fully cooked and crisp.  Preparing the Mango Mixture Cut the mango in two halves. Try to cut around the oval pit in the middle of the mango. Remove the mango pit. Peel and dice the mango.  Prepare the chili pepper. Wash the pepper and remove the stern and the seeds. Cut the chili pepper into small pieces. Mix the pepper with the mango in a bowl.  Preparing the Bread Drizzle some drops of water on the pita breads. This prevents the bread from going hard and dry in the oven. Warm the pita breads in an oven on about 225 C\u00ba for five minutes.  Assembling the Sandwich Cut the pita breads in halves. Cut across the rim so you end up with two flat, round halves. Spread some garlic sauce on one half.  Add some lettuce.  Add some chicken.  Add some of the mango-pepper mixture.  Top it off with the second pita half.  Finished. ",
