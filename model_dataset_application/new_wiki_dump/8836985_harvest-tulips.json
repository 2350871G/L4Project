When you notice the bulbs of tulips poking through the ground, it's time to prepare for harvest. As soon as tulips begin to emerge, care for them to encourage a quality harvest. Water the tulips when you see new growth. Once tulips begin to poke through the ground, start watering them more regularly.

For best results, tulips should be harvested during what is called the advanced bud stage. At this point, blossoms should still be closed.

Grasp the stem of the flower. Cut the main stem, but let the leaves remain in the ground. Do not try to remove the bulb or the leaves if you want flowers next year. Pull tulips out if you want to harvest the bulb. If you are harvesting the bulbs to sell or giveaway, pull the tulip upward from the soil. The bulb should come out of the ground.
