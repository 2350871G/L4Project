Some things to consider:\nWill the party be inside or outside? If outside, what will the weather be like? You may decide that your baby is not yet ready to handle an outdoor party in extreme temperatures or very windy weather. How many people will be there? If the party will be very noisy and crowded, you may want to skip the event. Babies tend to get distressed in large crowds. Will there be a lot of smoke? If many of the guests will be smoking, you should either skip the party or find a babysitter. You don\u2019t want to expose your infant to smoke. Will other babies or children be present? You may not feel comfortable being the only person at the party with a child in tow."
