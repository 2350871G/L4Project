          "description":"Unlike a regular sewing machine, a serger makes stitches using multiple threads at the same time. Typically, the number of threads that a serger can handle ranges from 2 to 5. If you only use your serger occasionally or just need to do basic overlock stitches, a 2/3/4-thread serger (which can use between 2 and 4 threads at once) is probably sufficient. Some sergers don\u2019t have a 2-thread setting, and can only do 3 or 4-thread stitches."

          "description":"If you\u2019re an advanced user and want to do more elaborate stitching, a 5-thread serger may be the best choice for you. 5-thread stitches are also ideal if you\u2019ll be working with woven, knit, or heavyweight fabrics.Tip: Different types of serger stitches have different uses. Get a book on serger techniques or search for tutorials online to figure out the best type of stitch for your project. There are also sergers available on the market that can handle up to 10 threads at once!"

          "description":"If you have limited manual dexterity or poor eyesight, threading a serger can be a struggle. Luckily, many serger models have an auto-thread feature that makes threading much easier. Self-threading sergers are generally more expensive than sergers that require manual threading, and relatively few companies make auto-threading models. If you need this feature, double-check the specifications of the serger you are interested in to make sure auto-threading is included."

You can buy separate coverstitching and serging machines or buy one machine that does both if you have limited space or are on a budget. Switching between the serging and coverstitching features on a combined machine can be a hassle, so you may wish to get separate machines if you have the space. Unlike a serger, a coverstitching machine can\u2019t trim extra fabric from the seam."

If possible, get a model that\u2019s primarily made of metal parts. As a rule of thumb, choose a relatively heavy model. A lot of weight tends to mean that the machine is constructed solidly.
