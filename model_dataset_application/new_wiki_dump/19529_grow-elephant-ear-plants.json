Tip: If you want to speed up the process, plant your bulbs in a pot inside a few weeks before early spring. Then, when it\u2019s warm enough, transfer them to your garden. The ideal daytime temperature will be around 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C)."

Typically, that means 3 to 6 hours of sun exposure per day. If a plant isn\u2019t getting enough sun, you\u2019ll notice the leaves turning yellow. The sunnier the spot, the more you'll have to water the plant to prevent the soil from drying out."

Drainage is equally important so that the plant\u2019s roots don\u2019t rot. Recreate tropical conditions in your garden by keeping the soil moist and not letting it dry out. Using a raised bed or installing a drainage system in your garden can help avoid overwatering. Test the drainage by digging a hole about 1 foot (0.30 m) deep and filling it with water. If it takes longer than 4 hours to empty, you have poor drainage. Don't oversaturate your soil when you water your elephant ears."

Use a home pH kit to test your soil and determine if it\u2019s the right level for your plants. To lower a soil\u2019s pH, add some sulphur, gypsum, or organic compost. To increase a soil\u2019s pH, sprinkle a little garden lime or limestone into the soil."

Leave enough space when you\u2019re planting to allow the plants to grow freely. Choose a clumping variety of elephant ears if you don\u2019t want them to spread. If you don't plant them far enough apart, the elephant ears will steal sunlight and water from each other. A larger plant will cover a smaller one, for example, so the leaves of the smaller plant can't get enough light. Prevent Elephant Ears from Taking Over Your Garden\nPick the Colocasia variety. This plant often produces a clump of plants in a smaller space rather than running rampant. Dig a 6 in (15 cm) border around the bulbs. Contain the runners by creating a deep edge between the elephant ears and other plants ins your garden. Divide the elephant ears when they outgrow the plot. Dig up and replant some of your elephant ear plants to spread them out. This will help avoid overcrowding. Move your plants to containers. If all else fails but you still love the look of elephant ears, transfer them to pots. Sit them outside or bring them indoors."

Use a spade or garden shovel to dig up the soil. The bulbs will push upwards as they grow so it's important to leave enough space that they won't break through the soil.

That part should be facing up. Press it firmly into the soil. The bottom may also have some root hairs leftover from the previous season. If you can\u2019t tell which end is the bottom, lay the bulb on its side in the hole. The roots will be able to grow down and the greens will grow up naturally."

A slow-release fertilizer keeps your plants fed by gradually releasing nutrients in the soil to promote steady, consistent growth. It also requires less maintenance on your part.
