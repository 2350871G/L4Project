You can also add the Oreos (or your preferred chocolate sandwich cookies) to a sturdy plastic bag, then smash them with a rolling pin or the bottom of a pan. Don't remove the white filling from the cookies before you crush them \u2014 the recipe accounts for it. As noted above, you'll want to preheat the oven to 350 degrees F for this recipe. You want the crumbs to be quite fine for this recipe. No noticeable chunks of solid cookie should remain. If you're making a graham cracker crust, just pulse the graham crackers and sugar together to make fine crumbs. The rest of the recipe is the same."

Melt the butter in a separate bowl in the microwave, then pour it over the crumbs and stir with a fork to combine.
