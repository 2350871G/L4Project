This makes it possible to calculate how far away the star is. RR Lyrae variables are similar to Cepheids, but they are dimmer, and have smaller periods and amplitudes. They follow a period-luminosity relationship in the infrared, not in visible light. Mira variables are red in colour, and have long periods, over 100 days, and very large variations. The maxima and minima also vary, so one cycle can be slightly brighter or dimmer than another. Mira variables are typically very dim, and need a telescope to see. Algol variables are a type of binary star. On occasion, the dimmer star eclipses the brighter one, causing the brightness to drop for a short period. Slow irregular variables, as the name suggests, vary slowly and irregularly. These stars don't have a period.

  "text":" Finding Variable Stars Go out stargazing. It sounds obvious, but this will be easier if you go out a few times and familiarise yourself with the stars and constellations. Identify a star that you want to observe. Decent variable stars have been studied for hundreds of years. Algol, Mira and Delta Cephei (\u03b4 Cep) are all good (if common) choices. For this article, we're going to be observing \u03b4 Cep. Find a couple of non-variable stars (guide stars) near your star. This works with one, but two is better, and three or more (if possible) is even better. These stars should be of a similar brightness to the star you are observing. For \u03b4 Cep, you can use \u03b6 Cep, which is slightly brighter than \u03b4 Cep at max brightness, and \u03b5 Cep, which is slightly brighter than \u03b4 Cep at min brightness. Compare how bright the variable star is to the guide stars every night. You should see it change brightness over time. \u03b4 Cep changes on a constant 5.37 day period. Recording Your Observations Get yourself a small notebook and a pencil. If you need a flashlight, place a red filter over the top of the lens when the light shines through; using a flashlight without doing this will ruin your night vision and make observation of these stars seem impossible. At the top, write down the name of the star you are observing. If you want, write down it's co-ordinates and how much it is meant to vary by. You can find the magnitudes quite easily by searching for the star on Wikipedia. Underneath, write down your guide stars. Again, you can write down their positions and brightness. Every night, record how bright your target star is compared to the guide stars. Write down the date and time as well, so you know when you took the observation. Try drawing a light curve. This is a graph of how your star varies over time. A light curve can help you to identify what type of variable star you are observing. If your star has regular variations, it can help you predict how bright it is going to be on the next night.
