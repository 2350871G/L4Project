          "description":"Find a cushion with a tag. The tag should tell you what kind of solvent you can use on the couch. For instance, if it's machine washable, you can use water. However, if it's not, you may need to use something else, like alcohol or vinegar. If your tag has a \"W\" you on it, you can clean it with water. If it has an \"S,\" use something like vinegar, rubbing alcohol, or a commercial dry cleaning agent. If it has \"S-W,\" you can use either one. A few might have the code \"X,\" which means vacuuming and professional cleaning only. If your couch doesn't have a tag, try cleaners in an inconspicuous place on the couch first."

Use your furniture attachment on your big vacuum cleaner or a hand vacuum cleaner to clean the couch. Remove the cushions to get the crumbs underneath, as well. Vacuuming will also help with pet hair!"

          "headline":"Use water and dish soap on any stains if your fabric can handle water.",
          "description":"Mix a few drops of dish soap with a cup of cool water. Dip a sponge in the mixture and wring it out. Dab at the stain or spill with the sponge for a few minutes until it's completely lifted. Wash out the sponge and dab at the stain with just water. Don't rub the stain, as you could spread it around."

You can also use the steam setting on your iron if you prefer. Just don't get the iron too close, especially if you're not sure how much heat the fabric can take."

Get a new baby wipe partway through if you need to. Microfiber doesn't absorb liquid so spills should be easy to blot up. You can also use a damp microfiber cleaning cloth."

Pick a commercial cleaner if stains persist. You can try a carpet or upholstery cleaner. Typically, you spray these on and let them sit, then you dab at them with clean water to wipe them up. Look for foaming carpet cleaner, for instance. You can find these cleaners at most stores in the cleaning product section."

Lift the cushions to vacuum the debris and dust underneath them. Also, vacuum along any parts you can't remove from the couch. Getting up the dust will help you deep clean it in a moment."

Leave the baking soda on for an hour or so, then vacuum it up. If the couch smells particularly bad, leave the baking soda on overnight. You can also try repeating the process a few times. You can also make a baking soda spray. Grab a small spray bottle, about 2 cups (470 mL) or so. Add warm water, 2-3 spoonfuls of baking soda, and a few drops of a scented oil. The exact measurements don't matter. Spritz it over the couch to help freshen the fabric."

Spray on the treatment and leave it on for the amount of time suggested on the bottle. Then, blot up the cleaner with a clean cloth or paper towel. Avoid rubbing the stain around with a brush or cloth as this will spread it."

Some take water, while with others, you may need to use another type of cleaner, such as alcohol. \"W\" means you can use water on it, while \"S\" means you can use other cleaners like rubbing alcohol or vinegar. You can also use commercial dry cleaning agents on \"S\" fabrics. \"S-W\" means either is fine. If you see \"X,\" that means you can't use any liquids on it. If you can't find a tag, test cleaners in a hidden area to see how they react."

Mix it lightly to get a sudsy solution and then dip a microfiber cloth into the solution. Wring out the cloth and wipe down the couch, moving from top to bottom. Wipe the couch down with plain distilled water, then dry it off with a clean microfiber cloth. Distilled water will not leave any water stains behind like regular tap water. You can also use a leather soap or a 50:50 vinegar and water mixture. Condition the leather with a 50:50 mixture of vinegar and lemon or flaxseed oil. Dip a cloth in the solution and wring it out. Then, wipe down the sofa with the cloth. Wipe the sofa with a dry cloth the following day."

Shake it lightly to mix it up, then use a scrubbing brush to rub it into your fabric. Once you've done the whole couch, scrub in plain water until you don't see suds anymore. Let the couch air dry.

Essentially, though, you put hot water and soap in the tank, then run the arm of the machine over the couch. The arm will pump out soap and water and vacuum it back up, cleaning the fabric. You can rent an upholstery cleaner from a home improvement store ($30-$50 USD) or purchase one if you prefer ($80-$150 USD). They may be labeled as \"carpet cleaners.\" There are both steam and non-steam options when it comes to upholstery cleaners.
