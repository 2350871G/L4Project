If you want your beach scene to take place in the middle of the day, then draw the sun as a full circle floating in the sky. If your scene is at night, add a moon by either drawing a circle or a crescent. Don\u2019t worry if the circle isn\u2019t perfect! Most of the time people don\u2019t look directly at the sun, so they don\u2019t really see a perfect circle. If you want, you can give your sun a friendly smiley face."

Draw the leaves like big feathers: make a curved line, and then a bunch of short lines coming off of it, all pointing downward. You can add as many palm trees as you want. Of course, if your beach is somewhere that doesn\u2019t have palm trees, you don\u2019t have to draw them. Draw a little wiggly line under the palm tree to make it clear it\u2019s standing on sand, not just floating."

Use a slightly diagonal line to draw the pole coming out of the sand. Draw a curved line facing down for the umbrella, and a bunch of little connected curves for the bottom of the umbrella. You can add a beach towel underneath the towel by drawing a diamond. This will look like a tilted towel."

You probably made a lot of extra wiggly lines when you were sketching with a pencil, and you don\u2019t need to keep those in. Once you go over the pencil lines with pen, you can erase all the pencil lines. Make sure the ink has dried before you erase the pencil or your eraser will smudge the ink."

          "description":"You can use yellow or brown for the sand, brown for the palm tree trunks, and green for leaves. If your scene is in the day, color the sky a light blue and the ocean a slightly darker blue-green. If your scene is at sunrise or sunset, color the sky with stripes of color, and make those colors reflect a bit off the water too. Your ocean will look more realistic if you color it with multiple colors, like blue, green, and purple, instead of all one color. You can color in your beach umbrella and beach towel bright colors like pink or yellow for some fun contrast!"
