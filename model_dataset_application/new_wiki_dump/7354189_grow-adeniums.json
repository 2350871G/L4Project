Mixing peat moss and sand keeps the soil well-drained while also retaining moisture. You can also use a soil mixture made for cacti and succulents. Fill a tray or pot with 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) of depth with the mixture. Line the bottom of the tray or pot with gravel for added drainage. You can substitute perlite instead of sand."

When replanting, place the adenium 1 inch (2.5 cm) higher in the soil so \u20442 inch (13 mm) of the root is above ground. This will ensure a thick caudex forms above ground. Since adeniums cannot survive in the freezing temperatures of winter, it\u2019s recommended that you keep them in planters or pots so they can easily be moved inside."
