  "text":" Before Entering the Pit Find a space to create a workstation and arrange all your materials before you. Flip the five-gallon bucket over for utilization as a chair.

Your first goal is to determine each soil horizon\u2019s boundaries, using the measuring tape nailed to the pit\u2019s wall. After determining the depth to the nearest centimeter, note whether the boundary distinction is abrupt, clear, gradual, or diffuse. Next, gather large, unbroken samples, about the size of your fist, from the top three horizons, and place them in separate cups of the muffin tin. Continue to gather samples from each successive horizon. You now have 10 Minutes out of the Pit Exit the pit and set down all supplies at your workstation. Shoot slope by looking through the clinometer at eye level from the top of one slope stake. Read the measurement where you see the tip of the second slope stake in the viewfinder. For best precision, walk to the other slope stake and repeat. Average these two scores and fill in the slope section of the description sheet.

You Now Have 10 Minutes in the Pit Gather any samples you may not have had time to collect in the first session.

After you are finished with the pit completely, return to your station and complete your analysis. Complete the horizontal columns.

These horizons also require either a dash beside them or a subordinate distinction or combination of subordinate distinctions. See Dr. Needlaman\u2019s manual for descriptions of the subordinate horizons. On the back page, check off any diagnostic subsurface horizons identified in the profile.  Determine hydraulic conductivity of both the surface layer and the limiting layer. The limiting layer is the fragipan or the layer with the highest clay percentage and weakest grade of structure. Use the Official Soil Judging Manual to determine hydraulic conductivity. Determine effective rooting depth by locating the horizon, if present, that restricts root growth. The depth of the limiting layer determines the effective rooting depth. Determine soil drainage class based on depth to redoximorphic features.  Indicate the parent material. Alluvium is deposited by water, colluvium, by gravity, loess, by wind, and residuum is rock weathering in place. More than one parent material may be present, but each parent material must occupy at least 40 centimeter (15.7 in) of the horizon. Write the depth of the beginning of the argillic horizon in the upper depth of the \u201cparticle size control section\u201d if an argillic horizon is present.

Particle size control sections cannot include surface horizons, bedrock, saprolite, or fragipans.
