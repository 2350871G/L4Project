          "headline":"Prepare the seed bed in mid to late fall.",
          "description":"Peas love fertile and well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. To achieve this, till the soil to a depth of 1 foot (30 cm), and work plenty of aged compost into the soil. To increase the acidity, potassium, and phosphorus levels, work some wood ash or bone meal into the soil as well. Snow peas need an environment rich in potassium and phosphorus in order to grow and produce peas. Snow peas are typically planted when it\u2019s still cold out, so preparing the soil in fall will give you a good head start."

          "headline":"Aim to plant in late winter or early spring.",
          "description":"Snow peas are a cool-season crop that will not grow or produce peas once the temperature reaches about 80 F (27 C), so it\u2019s very important to get an early start as soon as the ground can be worked. Ideally, you want to plant the peas four to six weeks before the last expected frost, when the soil temperature reaches about 40 F (4 C), and when the daytime temperatures are between 60 and 65 F (16 and 18 C). In warmer climates with milder winters, you can plant your snow peas in the fall and grow them over the winter."

The day before planting, place the seeds in water and let them soak for 24 hours. Right before planting, roll the seeds through the inoculant powder to coat them with the bacterium. Inoculant can be purchased at most garden centers, seed catalogs, or online."

The holes should be 4 inches (10 cm) apart and 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep, and the rows should be spaced 2 feet (61 cm) apart. Place a seed in each hole and cover the seed with additional soil. Planting the peas in double rows will make it easier to stake them. In sandier soil, make each hole 2 inches (5 cm) deep."
