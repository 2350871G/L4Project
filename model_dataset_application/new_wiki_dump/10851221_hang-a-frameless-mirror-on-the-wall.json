This step will be easier with the help of another person who can hold the mirror in place while you make the markings. Clips are best for small frameless mirrors. If you are hanging a large mirror, use J-channels or Z-clips in place of regular clips, which can support more weight.

Peter also has over 20 years of experience installing art and other mountable objects in residential, commercial, healthcare and hospitality contexts. Peter Salerno\t\t\tInstallation Expert\t\t\t\tThere are a number of different ways you can hang frameless mirrors. Peter Salerno, the owner of Hook It Up Installation, says: \"One simple way to hang a frameless mirror is with clips. You just put two on the bottom, one on each side, and one on the top. You can also install a track system and mount them so the opening is roughly the height of the mirror, then tip the mirror into place. Typically, it's a good idea to put a little mirror mastic on the back of something like that for added security. You can also buy hardware that will make the mirror look like it's floating out from the wall, which looks really cool.\""

          "description":"Based on the corner markings you made, use a spirit level to draw straight lines across the wall where the top and the bottom edges of the mirror will go. To use a spirit level, look at the bubble in the tube. If it is equally spaced between the two black center lines, then your edge is straight. If it slides off to one side, adjust the angle of the level until the bubble sits in the center."

          "description":"Clipping a mirror too tightly against a bumpy wall can cause it to shatter. To locate bumps, slide a straight-edged board that is longer than the mirror itself over the wall. A yardstick is a good option, but if that\u2019s too short, try a straight piece of 1 inch (2.5 cm) x 3 inches (7.6 cm) lumber. It will rock back and forth over a bump. Mark these spots with a pencil and sand them down. Power sanders are the simplest and quickest method. You can also use sandpaper wrapped around a wood block."

          "description":"Studs are the evenly-spaced wooden support beams that can be found behind most interior walls in homes. Slide an automatic stud finder along the wall to find the studs. With a pencil, mark the outside edges of each stud in the area where you plan to hang the mirror. If you don\u2019t have a stud finder, you can approximate the location of the studs by tapping on the wall. Taps between studs will sound more hollow, while taps over studs will sound more solid. If the mirror is positioned so it falls squarely in between studs, consider shifting its location so at least one clip can be screwed into a stud."

          "description":"Depending on the width of your mirror and the number of clips you have, space them out evenly. The mirror manufacturer may have recommendations about how to position the clips most effectively. Using a pencil, make a dot where the screw will go for each clip. Make sure to align the bottom edge of the clip with the line you drew marking the bottom edge of the mirror. The markings for the pilot holes will fall \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the line, depending on the size of the clips."

If any of the pilot holes do not fall on top of a stud, tap in a plastic wall anchor with a hammer until it is flush with the wall. Place a clip over each pilot hole and screw it into the wall with a screwdriver or drill. Make sure you're using the right clips. Bottom clips are typically made up of a single U-shaped piece of material, while top clips are composed of two L-shaped pieces."
