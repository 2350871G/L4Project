If it isn't, a table with folding legs is your best bet for transporting with ease, such as folding tables used for camping, or a card table. School desks, the teacher's desk, an outdoor table, or even a small dining table could all work as a basic stand for the stall. If you need a longer section for the stand than the table provides, and you're using a card table or small tables, arrange them in a row to make a rectangular configuration. Push the tables together closely, to avoid large gaps. If you need a really long configuration to fill a classroom or similar, consider an L-shape or U-shape consisting of many little desks (and lots of covers; see next)."

          "description":"This can be done in various ways, depending on your skills:\nFind two pole-style pieces of wood of the same height, higher than an average height adult standing next to them. Affix each pole to a square wood base. Use support wood chocks to keep the poles sturdily in place (nail or glue into place from the base leaning up onto the pole). Measure the distance of the stand and use this to determine the length of your bake stand sign. Cut the sign from plywood/scrap wood or very strong cardboard to this length, and a width of your preference. Affix this to each pole, the poles' width apart being the same as the stand. Use nails or wood glue to affix. Paint \"Bake Sale\" or such on the sign. To use, place the completed sign standing behind the bake stall. Use the same method for making the pole stands as in the previous suggestion. However, instead of adding a wooden sign, add a flag bunting/garland. The bunting can be sewn with the words \"Bake Sale\" quilted on, or marked on with fabric pen."

If possible, situate some of the stall under the shade of a tree, building or other object, to give your stall the most shade possible. If it is likely to be windy, ensure that the stand is placed near a form of wind break, such as a wall, a fence, or even your car if need be. Flying cakes and cookies don't sell well and tend to upset those who made the effort to bake them."

Be aware that if there are lots of people coming to the bake sale, labels that are hanging from the front will be blocked by line-ups or milling customers; messages you want to get across need to be placed at eye level (on a wall, pole, backdrop, etc. behind you)."

  "text":" Using a basic table Choose a table. Depending on where the bake sale is being held, it will be much easier if the table is already on the premises. If it isn't, a table with folding legs is your best bet for transporting with ease, such as folding tables used for camping, or a card table. School desks, the teacher's desk, an outdoor table, or even a small dining table could all work as a basic stand for the stall. If you need a longer section for the stand than the table provides, and you're using a card table or small tables, arrange them in a row to make a rectangular configuration. Push the tables together closely, to avoid large gaps. If you need a really long configuration to fill a classroom or similar, consider an L-shape or U-shape consisting of many little desks (and lots of covers; see next). Cover the table with a tablecloth. If the tablecloth won't reach completely, cover with two, overlapping the tablecloths neatly. Clean, old sheets are another excellent option. Use tablecloth clips or binder clips if the stand is outdoors and it's windy. This will help to keep the cloth in place. Using a trestle Find a trestle used for market stalls. If the place you're holding the bake sale already has trestles, use one of theirs. If not, you will need to either hire or buy one. As these can be quite pricey to buy new, hiring is a better option, or look for a used one through auction sites, well before the event. Unfold the trestle table legs. Check that they are firmly clicked in place. Some tables may have printed instructions on the underside of the tabletop, to help you work out how to put the legs in place properly. Cover with a sheet or large tablecloth. Alternatively, cover with large sheets of butcher paper or similar large white paper. If using paper, tape it down. It's also a good idea to have spare sheets, in case it rips and needs replacing. If outdoors, use tablecloth clips to keep a tablecloth or sheet in place. Bake sale signs and shade Make a bake sale sign that stands over the top of the stand. This can be done in various ways, depending on your skills:\nFind two pole-style pieces of wood of the same height, higher than an average height adult standing next to them.
