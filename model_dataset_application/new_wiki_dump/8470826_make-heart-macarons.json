Whip the egg whites on medium speed until they are light and frothy. To separate the egg whites from the yolks, break the eggs on a flat surface, such as a countertop or table. Divide the egg in half over a bowl, and allow the yolk to fall into the lower half. Move the yolk back and forth between the two halves, so the white can drip into the bowl below. Continue moving the yolk until all of the white has fallen out. You can use a handheld electric mixer to whip the egg whites if you don\u2019t have a stand mixer. You can whisk the egg whites by hand, but it will take a little longer."

A few drops of coloring will give you pink heart macarons, while more generous amount will give you red cookies. Red food coloring is the traditional option for heart macarons, but you can use any color that you like. Gel food coloring works best in the macaron batter, but you can also use liquid coloring."

After you\u2019ve piped all of the hearts, tap the cookie sheet against the countertop or table three to four times to remove any air bubbles. If you don\u2019t want to freehand pipe the hearts, you can find a heart shape image online and use it to create a template. Place it under the parchment paper or baking mat so you can trace the shape with the piping bag. Just be sure to remove the template before baking the macarons, though. You can also use a heart shape cookie cutter to serve as a stencil when piping the macaron batter. If you make heart macarons regularly, you may want to purchase a heart shaped baking mat specifically for macarons. They have heart shaped indentations that you fill with the batter, and are made of silicone so you can bake the cookies right on them without worrying about the macarons sticking."
