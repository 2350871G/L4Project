It is very important to follow the schedule, it will allow for the maximum gain of genetic potential (which you can read about in the breeders manual). One of the milestones your horse will reach is sexual maturity. This happens at 2 years and 6 months. If you have a mare at this point you may be tempted to breed her so that you can have another horse. If you want, you may, but it will take a while to earn your money back as you have a low paying job, and you can't sell horse until 10 days of seniority. Your mare, however, will be fully trained, and just needs BLUPing. Give her lessons everyday to continue adding skills until she is thirty years old, and enter her in lots of competitions to get her BLUP up. She needs to win 20!"

Here are some things to help give your EC a bit of a jump start:\nWhen you get your EC you are given 25,000 e. you will be tempted to buy stalls and start boarding horses right away. Don't, you will have nothing to offer prospective boarders. Instead, buy a green house if they are less than 19000e then buy a fertile six acre meadow. Grow tons of crops and sell turnips and oats and whatever you grow at the market. Build up your money until you have roughly 100,000 equus. Every day, buy 1000 droppings and make it into manure (on your meadow page at the top). Sell what you don't need to  fertilize your crops. Keep growing crops constantly. Always have apple in Autumn, flax in Spring  and wheat in Summer sell them for profit. When you have earned 25,000e buy 2 six acre fertile meadows and grow crops in them as well as the ones you already have. Start to grow ingredients for health mashes and make 100 of them. Lots of people start hiring right away. Don't! Your workers can't work until you have about 20-30 boxes that are occupied! Once you have enough money, buy 6 smallest boxes, 2 fertile 6 acre meadows and 6 rabbits. This is cost 37,980e. EDIT: rabbits are no longer on Howrse. Put your minimum skills to 4000% (so that people don't board), put flax as bedding in boxes and put 1 meadow as pasture. Every few days, swap this meadow with another one so the fertility and cleanliness don't go down. Make sure you have at least 10,000e, 200 carrots and 100 health mashes always. Once you have all employees, put your min skills to 0%. Keep making mashes, carrots and making money by selling crops. When you have enough, upgrade the boxes (do it all at the same time). When you have more than enough, buy five 15 acre fertile meadows. Buy 5 scarecrows and put them in the 15 acre meadows. Upgrade boxes again. Once a week increase the minimum skills by 20%. Start to buy 18m2 boxes (top quality) one at a time and get 2 more 15 acre meadows as pasture. Don't think this is going to be easy. It takes a long time but it's worth it!"
