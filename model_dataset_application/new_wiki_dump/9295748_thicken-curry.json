Stir your yogurt into the curry and keep adding a little more at a time until it reaches your desired thickness. This is great for Indian-style curries as a cream substitute. It can also come in handy if your curry is a little spicier than you would like, as it can cool your curry down."

Tomato puree is usually thicker than paste and has a slightly stronger flavor. Mix in a small amount of tomato puree or paste into the curry. Add a little at a time until the curry gets as thick as you want. If you don't have puree or paste, you can try diced tomatoes. For best results, add tomatoes or tomato puree during the cooking process rather than after."
