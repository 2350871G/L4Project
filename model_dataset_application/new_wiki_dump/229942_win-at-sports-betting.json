          "description":"To really make money on sports betting, you have to be dedicated, so it\u2019s a good idea to have a special account that\u2019s only for placing bets. When you open this account, be sure you invest enough money to cover your bankroll for an entire season or year, not just a single game. To ensure you have enough money, multiply your base bet by at least 100, and that\u2019s the minimum amount you should keep in this account at all times. If you're new to sports betting and don\u2019t know your base bet, put in whatever money you have set aside for this venture and determine your base bet on the size of your bankroll (each bet should represent one to two percent)."

For instance, while each bet should represent about one to two percent of your bankroll, you can reduce this to 0.5 percent if you aren't confident about a bet. Similarly, you can increase the bet if you're very confident, but never place a bet that exceeds four percent of your bankroll. There are also some experts who say never to place a bet if you aren't confident, because it\u2019s better to walk away and find a better bet that you feel good about. Many experts recommend not betting on your home team in any sport, because your bias can cloud your judgement, and this can lead to great losses."

For instance, if a moneyline is Toronto Maple Leafs -200 and Vancouver Canucks +155, it means you have to bet $200 on the Leafs in order to win $100, or you have to bet $100 on the Canucks to win $155. The team associated with the minus number (the Leafs) is the favored team, while the team associated with the plus number (the Canucks) is the underdog. Many gamblers bet on the moneyline in hockey and baseball, because the scores are lower and point spread betting doesn\u2019t make as much sense in these games.

In a point spread bet, you don\u2019t just bet on whether a team will win, but also whether that team will win by a specific amount. For instance, if a point spread is Detroit Lions +4, New England Patriots -4, you would bet on whether you thought the Lions would win and if they'd win by more than four points. Again, the team associated with the minus is the favorite and the team associated with the plus is the underdog."
