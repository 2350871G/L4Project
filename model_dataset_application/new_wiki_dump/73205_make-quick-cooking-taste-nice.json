      "headline":"Keep a variety or pasta and noodles on hand.",
      "description":"Dried pasta and noodles are extremely versatile and can be used to create an array of dishes, light lunches, dinners and side dishes can all be pasta or noodle based. Use different sizes and shapes to make meals more interesting. Dried pasta can be added to soups, stews or casseroles. Rice and other oriental styles can be used in  your favorite stir-fry and cooked pasta and fresh ingredients make great pasta salads. A quick go-to meal can be created quickly simply adding your favorite jarred sauce to some cooked pasta or noodles. Avoid over cooking pasta or noodles to keep it tasting nice. Add your favorite seasoning to improve taste and always taste before you serve. Try:\nTuna Pasta Bake\nMacaroni Cheese\nChicken Broccoli Pasta Salad\nBeef Stir Fry Noodles"

      "headline":"Stock up on sauce for pasta and noodles.",
      "description":"Of course you can use a jar of spaghetti sauce to pour over spaghetti for a quick meal any night of the week, but think outside the box a little when it comes to this pantry staple. You would be surprised how many different ways spaghetti sauce can be used. The great thing about spaghetti sauce is that all of the cooking has been done and that all the flavor is already sealed in. There are so many varieties on the store shelves that you can get a sauce with whatever flavor combination you prefer, or you can get a simple marinara sauce and spice it up your own way by adding fresh herbs and vegetables to suit your taste and your menu. Buy the best sauces you can afford if you intend to use them as they come, the cheaper kinds can be a bit bland. Most savoury sauces can be enhanced by the addition of dice onion fried until soft. Fried diced bacon makes many white sauces taste nice and if you have fresh herbs available, add them in or use them to garnish your quick cooked meals."

      "headline":"Be prepared with prepared broths.",
      "description":"Boxes or cans of prepared beef, chicken and vegetable broth are a must have pantry staple. When it comes to quick cooking you should not pass up any opportunity to add flavor. You can do this by substituting broth in place of water to add extra flavor to any recipe. You can cook rice in broth instead of water. If you cook often, larger boxes of broth can be stored in the refrigerator after opening so you can use as much or as little as you need; and they can sometimes be a better bargain than the cans. If you do wind up with leftover broth in an opened container and are afraid that you will not be able to use it quickly, pour it into ice cube trays and freeze it. You can pop out as many cubes as you need and melt them right into your recipe. You can even get fancy by adding some dried herbs to your broth cubes before freezing for extra flavor. If your budget allows, have chicken, beef and vegetable stock ready for use when you need it."

      "headline":"Keep  quick cook rice on hand.",
      "description":"Rice is a great way to add bulk to a dish and is a useful accompaniment to all kinds on meals. Serving a stir fry of meat and vegetables over rice makes a delicious and satisfying meal. Rice is also a great way to add some whole grains to your diet if you use brown rice or wild rice instead of white rice. Experiment with different flavors and find one that your family enjoys. Rice also makes a great side dish either by itself, with vegetables mixed in or simply topped with your favorite sauce. Don't limit rice to Chinese dishes, be inspired by the flavors of Mexico and don't forget rice pudding."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Keep condensed soups on hand.",
      "description":"Condensed soups are a fabulous way to add both moisture and flavor to quick cooking meals. You can often find recipe ideas right on the soup can labels and there have been entire cookbooks written around the theme of cooking with condensed soups. Cream of mushroom, cream of chicken, cream of celery and condensed cheese soup are probably the most popular. Take a close look at the soup selection the next time you are in the grocery store. Read the recipes on the labels and stock up on any that you can incorporate into your weekly menu planning. If nothing else, you can make soup for lunch or dinner on a cold rainy day. Don't forget the chicken noodle in case somebody doesn't feel well. Fresh herbs, croutons, grated cheese, pesto and sour cream can all add flavor to canned soups to improve the look and taste."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Learn which herbs and spices you enjoy in your meals.",
      "description":"Having a stock of herbs and spices on hand will really help \"spice\" up your quick meals. Kosher salt, whole black peppercorns (to grind in a pepper grinder), parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, cumin, chili powder, mustard powder and paprika are a great starting point. Unless you cook a lot, buy these items in the smallest quantity possible. Dried herbs and spices can lose their flavor and it is recommended that you  replace them after six months. You will wind up wasting money if you buy the jumbo size container of paprika and only use it once or twice and wind up throwing it away. Check the ingredients on your ready-meals and pre-prepared dishes, sauces etc and if you like the herb or spice include, add more. Use fresh when possible for extra taste, dried work well too and are more budget friendly. If your dried spices or herbs have exceeded their best before date, they are still okay to eat, they just don't have as much flavour."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Enhance your food with liquid condiments.",
      "description":"Worcestershire, soy sauce, hot pepper sauce, ketchup, chilli sauce and an assortment of vinegars are some liquid condiments that can pack a punch when it comes to adding flavor to your quick cooking. Vinegar is great for salad dressings too. Balsamic vinegar adds a richness to many dishes, and, you can add it at the table if preferred so diners can have as much or as little as they like."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Utilise canned or jarred tomatoes.",
      "description":"Having a variety of tomato products in your pantry is a great way to add flavor to your meals. You can add variety by mixing up the size of the tomatoes, from whole to finely diced, from pur\u00e9e to passata. You can even purchase these with herbs and spices already added. Canned cherry tomatoes are popular and an attractive addition to dishes. Make your own pizza sauce, meatball accompaniment or salsa."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Mix in canned beans to dishes or serve them on the side.",
      "description":"Beans are a great source of fiber and an excellent way to add bulk to your meals, but cooking with dried beans can take a very long time because you typically have to soak them overnight and then cook them for hours until they soften. Canned beans give you the same benefits in a fraction of the time and if you stock up when they are bargain-priced they can be beneficial to your wallet as well. Look for spicy Mexican beans, baked beans in tomato sauce, black and white beans. Add beans to bulk out meat dishes, white cannellini beans team well with chicken, use kidney beans in your Mexican dishes and add baked beans to shepherds pie or serve them with mashed potatoes and sausages."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Have extra Extra Virgin Olive Oil.",
      "description":"This is an absolute cooking staple. Even though oil is a fat, extra virgin olive oil is considered a healthy fat because it contains antioxidants like Vitamin E, it can lower you bad cholesterol while raising your good cholesterol and studies have shown that extra virgin olive oil can actually help prevent heart disease and certain types of cancer. You should keep in mind, though, that even with all of these health benefits, extra virgin olive oil is still a fat and it should be consumed in moderation. Two tablespoons per day should be your limit. There are many varieties of extra virgin olive oil on the market and some can be very expensive. Do a little taste testing to find a moderately priced brand that suits your palate and watch for it to go on sale. Don't cook with your extra virgin olive oil, used it to dress salads and vegetables."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Use citrus flavors to liven up quick cooked meals.",
      "description":"A little lemon juice on some baked frozen fish served with oven chips/fries and peas fresh from the freezer makes an everyday meal a little more interesting. Add lime juice to Mexican and Thai dishes when it will match well. Bottled and pouched lemon and lime juices keep well while a squeeze of fresh juice straight from the fruit adds real zing. Use a zester if you have one to make garnishes for your dish and add flavor."
