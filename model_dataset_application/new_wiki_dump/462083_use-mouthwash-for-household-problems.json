      "description":"With a white tissue dampened with a mint flavored mouthwash, you can remove smudges and dust from the screen of your monitor. As a screen cleaner, mouthwash is a bargain. Based on a price of just US$2 for 42 ounces - slightly less than 5 cents an ounce - it costs less than a penny to clean your computer screen. Just an important note - this trick works best on glass screens and is not recommended for computer monitors that use an LCD."

      "description":"The plaque-busting ingredients in mouthwash effectively clean toilet bowls and kill bathroom germs. Pour two ounces of mouthwash into the toilet bowl and let the liquid sit for 30 minutes. Follow up with a quick swish with a toilet brush and then flush."

      "description":"Working with garlic and onions can leave your hands with a strong odor long after the food has been cooked. To zap the scent, soak a cotton ball with mouthwash and apply it to your hands. This tip works best when you let the mouthwash dry before rinsing. Likewise, mouthwash or just plain alcohol can also banish underarm odor during a midday emergency."

      "headline":"Create an anti-fungus treatment.",
      "description":"A mixture of mouthwash and water (25 percent mouthwash and 75 percent water) can be sprayed onto plant leaves suffering from mildew and fungus. Use once a week. Meanwhile, mild cases of athlete's foot and toe fungus can be treated with mouthwash. Soak a cotton ball with (sugar free) mouthwash and apply it to the foot several times a day. The athlete's foot may disappear in days, but toe fungus will need professional medical counsel."
