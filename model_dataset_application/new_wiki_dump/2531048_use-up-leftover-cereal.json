      "description":"Make the cereal either as your main ingredient or as a topping. Any cereal nicely accommodates yogurt in a bowl and a sweet breakfast treat as well. If you're planning on using it as the main ingredient, try putting it in layers with yogurt to get equal amounts in each bite."

      "headline":"Use them with desserts or snacks.",
      "description":"Try to match sweet desserts with the cereal flavors, for example, chocolate cereal on a chocolate cake. Rice Krispies is a main ingredient for Rice Krispies marshmallow treats. Granola can be \"recycled\" and turned into cereal bars. Use them as doughnut toppings."

    {
      "headline":"Substitute it for breadcrumbs.",
      "description":"Cornflakes or bran cereals are great examples. Place the cereal into a small snack or sandwich sized plastic zipped bag. Use a rolling pin to crush it into crumbs; you can also have a kid mash the contents as well. After dipping the food into the egg wash, dip it into the cereal before baking/cooking. These \"cereal breadcrumbs\" can be used as a covering for just about anything, including crab cakes, chicken, or a casserole topping."

      "headline":"Avoid tossing the sugar away.",
      "description":"If you use raisins or pecans in muffins, roll them around the cereal sugar in a small bowl. This helps out in the recipe because the ingredients won't sink to the bottom of the dessert while baking."

      "headline":"Mix cereals together.",
      "description":"Share the love goodness in multiple boxes and add everything to a large container. Your kids may or may not mind by the multiple flavors in their bowl, but that can be solved by adding fresh chopped fruit in there as well."
