          "description":"For the sugared rose petals, you\u2019ll need 2 to 4 organic roses. Carefully pull the petals from the flower, working slowly so you don\u2019t tear them. Collect the petals on a plate or in a bowl. Be sure to use pesticide-free roses so they are edible. If there is a white area at the base of the petals, you should cut it way. It usually has a bitter taste that makes it unpleasant to eat."

          "description":"After you\u2019ve removed the petals from the roses, fill a large bowl with cool water. Gently rinse the petals in the water to remove any dirt or debris that may be lingering on the surface. It\u2019s best to rinse the petals only a few at a time. Handle the petals gently as you wash them because they may bruise if you are too rough."

Next, place a cooling rack on the baking sheet and set it aside for the moment. You can line the baking sheet with wax paper or foil if you prefer. The liner just makes cleanup easier in case any sugar or liquid drips off the petals as they set."
