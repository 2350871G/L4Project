Most homegrown heads reach sizes of about 4 to 6 inches in diameter, but refer back to your seed packet for a better estimate. If you lightly squeeze the head, it should feel tight as there should be very little space between the florets. Don\u2019t worry if the head isn\u2019t as tightly packed as store-bought broccoli. Since it doesn\u2019t have to be transported anywhere, it can be harvested at a later stage."

Clip these in the same way you harvest the main head, ensuring you cut the stalks at an angle and leave a couple of inches of stalk at the bottom. You can get several harvests throughout the season by following this process, and side shoots will take longer to bolt/flower.
