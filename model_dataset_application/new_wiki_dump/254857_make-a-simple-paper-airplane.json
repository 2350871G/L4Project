          "description":"Use an 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm) piece of paper. Make a vertical (hotdog) fold down the middle of the sheet to create a long, thin rectangle. Check that the corners of the paper match up exactly. Use your thumb or a flat-edged tool, like a butter knife or a wooden tongue depressor, to create a sharp crease. This will help your plane fly once it\u2019s finished."

This will form triangular flaps on each side of the paper and will turn the top of your paper plane into a point. The bottom edge of the flap should be a straight line."

Press along the crease to make it sharp. Once this is finished, you should have a sharp, narrow point at the end of your plane. The paper should look like a dart. Most of the paper now will be in the shape of a triangle, with a point at the top."

Check that the edge of the flap is parallel to the bottom crease, then press down on it to create a wing. Next, flip the paper over and repeat on the other side to create the second wing. You should have a finished dart plane. Test it out to see if it flies!Variation: To make a slightly more advanced version of this basic paper airplane, just add wing tips. On the back edge of one of the wings, make a small fold. The fold will be in the shape of a small triangle. Bend it upwards so you have a wing tip that points towards the sky. Repeat on the other wing, making sure the creases of the tips match."

Make sure that the edges are lined up evenly, then press down to create a sharp crease. You should now be able to see the folds. Make wings by folding the sides down over the crease. Turn the paper so that the bottom of the crease is facing you. About .5 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) from the crease, fold your paper flap down to create a long wing. Then, flip the paper over and bend the other side in the exact same spot. Use your finger to press down on the folds and make them sharp. The folds should be on the bottom of the plane.
