          "description":"Out of season fish have to be frozen, which takes away their freshness. Start by looking for options that are in season. If you aren\u2019t sure where to start, asked the employee which fish was freshly-caught. Most ocean fish are freshest in the late spring and summer. Some shellfish are fresher in the fall and winter. Other fish are caught year-round, so ask the worker which is the freshest option."

Check for these signs on any fish you\u2019re considering. Spoiled fish have cloudy eyes that are hard to see through. The eyes also start sinking as the fish dehydrates."

          "description":"A fresh fish still has blood in it, so its gills should be bright red. Lift up the gill flap near the fish\u2019s head, or ask the employee to lift it for you. Underneath you\u2019ll see the spongy gills. Look for a bright and uniform color on the gills to indicate the fish is still fresh. Spoiled fish gills look darker red, more like a brick. Look for a uniform color on the gills as well. If there are different shades on the gill surface, the fish isn\u2019t fresh."

Press in a few different spots. Fish sometimes bruise in different areas. A store employee may now want you touching the fish with your bare hands. In this case, ask them to push on it and watch to make sure the skin springs back."

Do a visual check for any discoloration before buying a fillet. Look especially on the edges of the fillet where it was cut. If the edges are drying out our changing color, the fillet is starting to go bad. Some fish have fibers or stripes on their skin that could look like discoloration.

Sometimes an uneven cut can look like tearing. The difference is that a spoiling fillet will look tight, which tears and flakes the skin. Look closer and see if the skin is actually flaking, or if there was just an uneven cut."

Cloudy or discolored sign is an even worse sign. Avoid any fish with milky slime on its surface. If the employee lets you, run your finger across the fish. If the moisture is sticky and slimy, this isn\u2019t a fresh fish fillet."

Fish wrapped in plastic at the store is generally not as fresh. Limit your choices to unwrapped fish packed on ice. Fish in refrigerators is generally not as fresh. The fresh fish are kept on ice."

For fish markets specifically, a lot of customers means that fish gets sold quickly and fresh catches are brought in regularly. Spend a few minutes around a store or market you\u2019re considering shopping at and see how many customers enter. If there aren\u2019t many customers, consider shopping somewhere else. Take the time of day into account. Most food stores are less busy during weekdays. If, however, it\u2019s Saturday afternoon and there are no customers, then avoid this establishment. In larger supermarkets, the store could still be crowded if the fish isn\u2019t good. Watch the fish counter specifically for a few minutes and see if anyone buys something.

Puddles on the floor from melted ice, dirty floors, cleaning products near food, and unpleasant smells are all indications that a store does not follow sanitary procedures closely. The fish area of any store should be neat and clean. Look for nicely-arranged and labeled fish. Fish pieces like heads and scales shouldn't be visible or near the fresh fillets.

If you can\u2019t find basic information about the fish, consider shopping at a different store. Common information on seafood labels include whether the fish was freshly-caught or farmed, and whether or not it was frozen. Very reputable dealers will include the date that the fish was caught as well. Sometimes labels are technically accurate, but still misleading. For example, \u201cFresh salmon, previously frozen\u201d is technically true if the salmon was frozen right away.
