These deposits reduce the unit's efficiency, so you need to remove them. If your filter doesn't have deposits, put it back, and check it in a month or so.

It mostly depends on how hard your water is, as that's what causes buildups. Check on it every two months to see if it needs cleaning until you figure out how often yours will need to be cleaned. If you have a newer salt system, the cell may not even need cleaning out, as these systems have built-in ways of keeping deposits from building up. Watch for the signal.
