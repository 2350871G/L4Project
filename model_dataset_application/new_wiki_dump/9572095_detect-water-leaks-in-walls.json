          "description":"This is the simplest way to tell that you have a water leak in your walls. You can be sure that water is leaking in a wall if you see conspicuously wet carpet or notice that the floor is always wet in a certain area of your home. You\u2019re most likely to see wet flooring near major appliances that use water (washing machine, dishwasher) or in the bathroom near the sink, toilet, or shower."

          "headline":"Look for discoloration on a wall.",
          "description":"If water is leaking in a wall, eventually the outer surface of the wall will take on some discoloration. Look for sections where the surface of the wall\u2014whether it\u2019s wallpapered, drywall, or even wood\u2014is slightly washed out or has a lighter color than the surrounding area. The shape of the discoloration is likely to be irregular."

          "headline":"Inspect walls for a change in texture.",
          "description":"Walls that have water leaks behind them are likely to develop a bubble-like texture. Paint or wallpaper will twist and buckle, forming rips or bubble-like shapes as the water distorts their usual texture. Water-logged drywall will appear to sag downward. Small bubbles or drooping sections may also indicate the presence of water in your drywall. Walls with advanced leaks in them may also appear to curve outward. Drywall will eventually buckle under the weight of the water saturating it."

        {
          "headline":"Note any signs of mold or mildew.",
          "description":"If a leak in a wall has gone on for some time, mold may be growing in and on your wall. In its early stages, mold looks like a dense cluster of black or brown dots. Even if you don\u2019t see mold, it may still be growing inside of the walls that have been saturated with water by the leak. Mold can cause allergies, and lead to other potentially serious health problems. If you see mold growing on a wall, remove the mold and fix the leak in your wall."

          "headline":"Pay attention to any musty smells.",
          "description":"In cases where a leak behind a wall isn\u2019t visible, you may be able to detect the leak using your sense of smell. Since water that leaks into walls never has a chance to dry out, the walls will begin to give off a humid, musty odor. Musty-smelling walls will often be accompanied by other signs of a leak (e.g., discoloration). This will not always be the case though; sometimes an odor will be the only sign of a leak deep in a wall. Thick drywall can effectively absorb water (almost like a sponge) and prevent any visual signs of the leak from showing."

Pay attention in the first few seconds after you turn off the shower, flush a toilet, or turn off a sink. If you hear a faint dripping sound coming from a nearby wall, it could be caused by a leaking pipe. Newer piping made of plastic PVC pipe will amplify the sound of dripping, making it easier to hear. If you have an older house with iron pipes, you\u2019ll have a harder time hearing a leak."

For example, the EPA suggests that a family of 4 typically uses no more than 12,000 gallons (45,000 L) of water in cold months. If you\u2019re using substantially more water and can\u2019t figure out why, it could be because of a leak. Of course, this won\u2019t tell you where the leak is located, but at least it can indicate whether or not you have a leak in a wall."

If the water meter reading doesn\u2019t change over the course of 3 hours, the leak isn\u2019t coming from your plumbing.
