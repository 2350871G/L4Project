  "text":" Growing Tulsi from Seeds Fill a flower pot with high quality soil and water it thoroughly. You should leave about an inch (2.54 cm) of space at the top of the pot.

Be careful not to leave the plant near open windows or doors if the temperature cools down overnight. Rooting Tulsi in Water Cut a 4-6 inch (10-15 cm) stem from a mature tulsi plant. Remove the stem right below a set of leaves. Pluck all the other leaves from the bottom portion of your cutting. You\u2019ll want to leave about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the stem completely bare.

Keep the tulsi in the potted soil for 2-3 weeks before planting outdoors if you choose to. Caring for Your Tulsi Plant Water your tulsi when the top layer of soil becomes dry. You should check your plant at least twice a week to see if it needs to be watered. If the top of the soil is dry, water it. How often you need to water the plant will vary depending on the temperature and climate. Fertilize your plant once a month.
