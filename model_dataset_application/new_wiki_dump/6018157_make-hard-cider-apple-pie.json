  "text":" Making the crust Use a regular shortcrust pastry. You most likely already know how to make one, but in case you don't, here's the method. Start by mixing half a tablespoon of salt and 2 1/2 cups of flour in a large bowl. Take two sticks of softened, unsalted butter in pieces and start mixing it in using your fingers or a pastry blender. Keep cutting and mixing until the dough consists of pea-sized pieces. Start with five tablespoons of water and mix. Keep adding water until the dough sticks. (the amount may vary on the type of flour/butter used). Separate the dough in two and shape them into flat disc shapes (about the same size). Put them in a bowl, cover with backing paper and stick them in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Making the filling Combine 4 1/2 cups sliced apples, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, a pinch of salt and a tablespoon lemon juice in a mixing bowl. Mix and let sit for at least 10 minutes. In a cooking pot, combine 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup of the cider. Let boil while stirring frequently. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the marinated apple slices and boil again for at least seven minutes. Add the 1/4th cup remaining cider, half a teaspoon vanilla extract and three tablespoons cornstarch. Do this in a separate bowl. Mix until you get a paste. Add this into the cooking apples and boil while stirring for several minutes. After everything is dissolved and the filling is deemed thick enough to your personal taste, take the pot from the fire and let sit for about 20 minutes.  Making\\/Baking the pie Take your dough from the fridge and roll it flat. The diameter depends on your own preferences, but for this recipe, 12 inches is recommended. Add flour to the de-rolling surface and the top of the dough so it doesn't stick. Put one of the dough circles into a round pie pan. Push and shape it to fit snugly around the mold. Fill the pie with your filling and put the second dough circle on top as a lid. Fold and push the corners to make a close fit. Finish by making some vents on top of the pie (at least 3). Get creative with decorating the top. With a fork, you can make some really nice patterns, for example. Once you're done, pop the pie in the fridge for another 20 minutes. This ensures that the filling and crust both have the same temperature when going in the oven. Preheat your oven on 425\u00b0 F (220 \u00b0 C) and bake your pie for 20 minutes.Than lower the temperature to 375\u00b0 F (190 \u00b0C) and bake another 30 to 35 minutes.  Take your pie out of the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.  Serve warm with ice cream or whipped cream, hard cider and apple juice for the kids. ",
