However, due to the way gloves are laced, it might not be possible to untie your glove\u2019s laces. If you cannot unlace your glove\u2019s laces, you can skip this step, or use a sharp implement to cut them. If you choose to cut your glove\u2019s laces, you won\u2019t be able to use them again, and will have to obtain new laces or take your glove to a sporting goods store to have it re-laced. If you\u2019re re-lacing your glove after removing the laces, aim to reproduce the same level of lace tension the glove had before you removed its laces."

Generally, however, you\u2019ll simply dab a clean cloth with a bit of the leather cleaning agent, then rub it onto the glove in a gentle motion. You could apply it with small circular motions, or back-and-forth wipes. Consult manufacturer directions for more detailed information regarding use. After applying the leather-cleaning agent, you must typically wait for a few hours or up to 24 hours. Check manufacturer directions regarding the length of time you must wait before using or conditioning the glove. Take care not to overuse your leather-cleaning agent. Overuse could cause the agent to build up on the glove and clogs its pores. Check the label on your leather-cleaning agent for information regarding the frequency with which you should apply it."
