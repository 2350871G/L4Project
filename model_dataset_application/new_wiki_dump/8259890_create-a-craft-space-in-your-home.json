Look for a space that has access to natural light. It is also best if the space is quiet and not close to inside or outside traffic. Consider how much room you will need for your supplies and to carry out your craft making. Choose a space where you will have easy access to electrical sockets."

You may want to  paint a larger space before adding furniture and supplies. Also consider the flooring. Think about carpeting, rugs, or tiling.

Your space should at least be able to fit a desk and chair. For a larger space, you will need a desk, comfortable chair, and table, along with organizational furniture. The desk should be large enough to work at comfortably.
