If you aren't eating them right away, store the truffles in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Since they contain cream, they shouldn't be left too long at room temperature. Homemade Chocolate Bars Gather your ingredients. Here's what you'll need to make homemade chocolate bars:\n1 cup cocoa butter\n1 cup dutch process cocoa powder\n1/2 cup honey, maple syrup or agave nectar\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract Melt the cocoa butter and sweetener. Place the cocoa butter and sweetener (be it honey, maple syrup or agave nectar) in a bowl. Microwave it on high until the cocoa butter is completely melted, then stir the ingredients together until smooth. Add the cocoa powder and vanilla. Stir them into the mixture until the ingredients are completely blended and no lumps of cocoa powder remain. Pour the chocolate into molds. Use candy molds or create bars of chocolate by pouring the mixture into the bottom of a small baking pan, such as a bread loaf pan. Let the chocolate cool. Allow the chocolate to harden at room temperature, or place it in the refrigerator to speed things along. If you're making chocolate bars, score the chocolate to create bar shapes halfway through to make the bars easier to cut later. Remove the chocolate from the molds. Pop the chocolate candies from the molds, or cut the chocolate into bars. Store chocolate you don't immediately eat in the refrigerator. Finished. ",
