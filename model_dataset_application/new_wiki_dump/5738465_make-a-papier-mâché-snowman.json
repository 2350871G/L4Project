  "text":" Forming the base, and applying the newspaper Remove the cap from the empty bottle. Stick the foam ball onto the mouth of the bottle with the craft glue. Pour some of the glue into a plastic cup and mix it with water until it forms a milky, watery-like substance.  Cut the newspaper into 1-2 inch (2.5-5cm) squares.

After covering the entire snowman, wait a couple of hours for it to dry, and then apply another layer. Continue adding layers until you're happy with the final look, allowing for drying time in between each layer. Painting, and doing the finishing touches Using a paintbrush, paint the entire surface of the snowman with the white tempura paint. After it dries, you can apply a second layer if you wish, depending on how thickly you applied the first layer of paint. Once the paint dries, add any decorations that you wish to use. Some suggestions are provided in the next steps. Add the snowman's features. Paint or glue on eyes, nose and mouth. Suggestions for these include:\nMarker or painted eyes; or stick on googly eyes.
