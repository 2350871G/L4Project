You can buy fishing rods from Anglers Anonymous Merchants such as Ken in Navea (X: 274, Y: 404) or Alyssa in Ventos (X: 468, Y: 202). Only basic rods are available for purchase. You can find advanced rods in crates you can receive while fishing. You can get basic fishing equipment for free by completing Fishing Quests."

          "description":"Different fish require different types of bait. Each fish drops different items, such as fishing equipment and even rare costumes. You can buy bait from Anglers Anonymous Merchants. You can see which type of bait you need for the fish you want by looking at the fish's description. White bait costs 18 silver. You will be able to catch White and Blue fish with White bait. Blue bait costs 35 silver. You will be able to catch Green fish with the correct Blue Bait. Green bait costs 67 silver. You will be able to catch Orange fish with the correct Green Bait. Orange bait can only be found or received as a quest reward. By doing your daily fish quests, you may receive orange bait as reward. If you have enough tokens, you can buy the bait from the fish merchant for 50 tokens, or you can simply fish for orange fish. They sometimes give orange baits as drop. Doing fishing quests will also reward you with rare baits."

Different maps in the game give different levels and types of fish. The higher the level of the map, the tougher and higher tier equipment needed to fish.

A circular window will appear on your screen with an image of a fishing line. There are three different fishing modes available:\nPassive - This is the default fishing mode. As soon as you cast out your line, your character goes into Passive mode, and will automatically pull in fish until you are either out of bait or your inventory is full. This is great for farming equipment such as the Green fishing set. You cannot catch Orange fish in passive mode. Active - In this mode, you control your rod. To do this, once a fish takes your bait, click the fish icon in the circular window to start reeling. See the next Step for details on how to fish in Active mode. Active Mode is time-consuming and has a greater possibility of bandits appearing. Semi-Active - In this mode, you will control your rod whenever you desire. For instance, if your indicator shows that a weak fish caught your bait, you can leave it to passive. If the indicator tells you that you caught a powerful fish, you can take control to successfully catch it. This mode is still time-consuming, and bandits may still spawn."
