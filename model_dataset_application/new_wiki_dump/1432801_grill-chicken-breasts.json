  "text":" The Basics Prepare the grill to help the chicken cook better. Use a grill scraper to remove any residue from the grill. Lightly spray the cooking surface with non-stick spray so the chicken will not stick to it. Light the grill, according to your model's instructions, and let preheat on a medium-hot setting for about 5 minutes before placing the chicken onto the grill. Do not overcrowd the chicken breasts on the grill or they may stick together and be difficult to flip over. Let them sit for about 3 minutes without turning. Check the bottom side of the chicken breasts after about 3 minutes and flip them when they begin to look opaque. Cook for about 2 or 3 more minutes if they're still pink. Turn down the heat if it looks like the outside of the chicken is getting blackened, since this could mean the chicken is burnt on the outside but still raw inside. Grill the other side for approximately 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of your chicken breasts. Grill thin cut portions for a shorter amount of time, and grill thicker ones longer. Check after about 5 minutes to see if the chicken appears to be a solid color with no visible pinkness. Use a meat and poultry thermometer to make sure that the internal temperature of the chicken has reached 185 degrees. Make sure any juices that run out of the chicken breast when you insert the thermometer run clear. Grill Barbecue Chicken Coat chicken with honey to help the barbecue sauce stick to the chicken.  Use a cooking brush to coat the chicken with your favorite sauce before placing it on the grill.  Keep a bowl of sauce out while grilling and brush sauce thickly onto the chicken every few minutes. Avoid contaminating your food. Use a clean brush to coat the chicken once it's cooked. Grill Lemon Herb Chicken Squeeze the juice of 1 lemon and sprinkle a few pinches of herbs over each chicken breast. Marinate the chicken in the lemon herb mixture for at least 1 hour or overnight. Remove from the marinade when you are ready to grill and discard the leftover marinade.  Cut 1 or 2 more lemons in half and use them to squeeze lemon juice onto the chicken as you grill it.
