Never attach propane to the grill with the grill cover closed: If the propane is accidentally turned on with the grill cover down, it could accumulate under the cover and explode in a fireball, causing serious harm. Make sure the gas is turned to the off position before hooking the propane tank up to the grill. Remove the empty tank from the grill if you haven't already. The grill is now ready for your safe set up!"
