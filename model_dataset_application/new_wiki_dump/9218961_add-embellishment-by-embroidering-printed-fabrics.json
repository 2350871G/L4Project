          "headline":"Outline the printed design on the fabric.",
          "description":"One simple way to embellish a printed fabric using embroidery is by stitching an outline of the images or image on the printed fabric. You can hand stitch around some or all of the design(s) to embellish the printed fabric. Make sure to use a corresponding or complementary color of thread to embellish your printed fabric. For example, if your fabric has an all over floral print, then you could stitch around the edges of the petals and leaves. You may stitch around all of the petals and leaves, or just around a few to add an embellishment. If your fabric has a single flower printed on it, then you could stitch around the edges of that flower. Or, if the fabric has a teddy bear on it, then you could stitch around the edges of the teddy bear\u2019s body, or get even more detailed and stitch around the details of the teddy bear\u2019s face."

          "headline":"Embroider complementary designs onto the fabric.",
          "description":"If you are looking for a more intricate way to embellish a printed fabric with embroidery, then you can also try embroidering a complementary design onto the fabric. Choose an embroidery design that will build on what is already printed on your fabric. You can embroider this design by hand or using a sewing machine with embroidery settings. For example, if your fabric has flowers printed on it, then you could embroider a bee or hummingbird next to one of the flowers to add an accent. If your fabric has a snowman on it, then you could embroider some snowflakes around the snowman."

          "headline":"Add an overlay to a printed fabric.",
          "description":"As an even more intricate way of embellishing your printed fabrics, you may consider adding an overlay. This is an embroidered design that will go directly over your fabric and cover part of the printed design as a way of enhancing it. For example, you could stitch a bow tie onto a printed image of a rabbit. Or, you could stitch additional details onto a leaf or flower. You can do this by hand or using a sewing machine with embroidery settings."

        {
          "headline":"Embroider a border around an image.",
          "description":"If your fabric has an image printed onto it, such as a photo, then you could also add an embroidered border. Embroidering a square or circular border around a photo will give the effect of a picture frame on the fabric. Use a pre-printed embroidery pattern to help you create the border. You can print a border pattern, lay it over the fabric so that it is framing the photo, and then embroider over the design using a sewing machine."

          "description":"Wash and dry your fabric before you begin to embroider it. This will help to ensure that the fabric will not shrink after you have embroidered it, which may distort the image. You may also want to iron your fabric before you embroider it to ensure that it is flat and free of wrinkles. This may make the fabric easier to embroider."

          "headline":"Use a stabilizer if needed.",
          "description":"Stabilizers are backing fabrics that you can use to reinforce your work. This can be especially helpful if you are doing heavy embroidery work. You can either hold the stabilizer in place using a hoop or you can pin it in place while you embroider the material. You can find different types of stabilizing fabrics in craft supplies stores. The type will vary based on different factors, such as your fabric type. For example, a light fabric will only require a light stabilizer, while a heavy fabric will require a heavy stabilizer."

          "headline":"Make sure your needle is sharp.",
          "description":"A sharp needle is essential for any type of sewing or needlecrafts, but it is especially important when you are using a machine for embroidery. If your needle is dull, then it may result in snags in your machine and this can ruin an embroidery job. Check to see if your needle is sharp before you begin. A good rule of thumb is to change your sewing machine\u2019s needle after every project or after every four hours of sewing. You should also make sure that you are using a sharp needle if you are hand embroidering your fabric."

          "headline":"Use a hoop.",
          "description":"A hoop is standard equipment for needlework, but it may be even more important to use a hoop when you are embroidering printed fabrics. Keeping your fabric taut and focusing on one section at a time will help to ensure that you get the best results possible. Choose a strong wooden embroidery hoop with brass closures to keep your fabric taut and in place."
