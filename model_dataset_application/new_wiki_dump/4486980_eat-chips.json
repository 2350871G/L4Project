This'll push the bottom of the bag up as you eat, keeping the chips close to the opening so you don't have to dig. You can also roll the bag down from the top, but it can sometimes rip and spill the chips."

Try to eat single chips to minimize the noise, or coordinate your munching with other movements, like turning pages or opening and shutting drawers. Ultimately, there is no way to soundlessly eat chips. Just try and be considerate of those around you if you're in a shared space."
