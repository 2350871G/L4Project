Do this right where the funnel of the soda bottle ends, and where the large shaft begins (near the middle of the bottle). After you have poked the hole in the bottle, insert your scissors and cut around the bottle. Cut off the entire top funnel, so that what you have left are two separated pieces: funnel (top) and shaft (bottom). Try to cut as close to the edge of the funnel as possible, otherwise, when you flip the funnel upside-down it won't stay in place. You can also use a sharp knife to cut the top funnel off, but make sure not to cut yourself. If you are doing this project with your kids, it is better to use a safe pair of scissors."

If this project is done with children, an adult should staple the two parts together. If you do not have a stapler, the following two options work fine as well. Tape is another good option, but make sure that the tape is water resistant. Apply three or four pieces of tape around the funnel. If you wish to use superglue, or regular glue, that will also have to be water resistant. Before you add the funnel, apply a thin layer of glue around the top inside of the base.

  "text":" Making a Bottle Fly Trap Grab an empty soda bottle. This can be one that is used, or simply pour out the soda.

Creating a Tin Can Fly Trap Find a suitable can. A standard size dog food can or a soup can are perfect. Remove the paper label, the can lid, and wash it clean with warm water. Dry before proceeding to the next step. Cut out lengths of duct tape. They need to be long enough to wind around the can. Try not to touch the sticky ends, or get them dirty, otherwise the trap will not work. Wrap the lengths around the can. Press the duck tape tightly against the can with your hands. Give the duck tape a gentle rub in order to transfer the stickiness. Remove the duct tape from the can. The surface of the can will now be sticky. Gently touch the can to see how sticky it is.

Make sure to use a pair of gloves when you contact the can, so you do not have to touch the flies. It might be best to have a plastic grocery store bag ready to place the can in, before you throw it away in the trash. Inventing a Plastic\\/Glass Jar Fly Trap Obtain a small container. This can be either a glass jar (jelly jar) or a plastic container, something you might put nuts or peanut butter in. If the container or jar has a lid, remove it. Add vinegar to the container. Buy a jar of apple vinegar and pour about an inch or so of it into the container. This will attract the flies to the container. Add dish soap to the vinegar.

The bag should generally should be tall, as you will need to make long strips of sticky fly paper. Do not use plastic bags, otherwise the sticky mixture won't stick to the plastic. Cut out strips of paper. Use a pair of scissors, and cut out strips that are about one inch by six inches. You will need about four-five of these strips.

You will need strings for each strip of paper. Feed the string/wire through the hole and tie a knot.How to Tie a Knot Make a sugar mixture. Place one part sugar, one part honey, and one part water into a saucepan. Put the saucepan on the stove, and heat on medium-high until the ingredients are mixed in well. After the ingredients are mixed, let the mixture cool to room temperature. Dip the paper into the mixture. Place each strip into the mixture in order to coat it in syrup. Place each strip on a baking sheet, and let the strips dry out. Hang the strips up. Find a nail, or a tack, and hand the string up. You can either place them all near each other, or hang them all around the house. Hanging them near one another will make a more effective trap. Throw the paper away. After your strips have been coated in flies, simply take them down and throw them away. If for some reason the strips are not working, it is likely that they do not have enough syrup on them. You can always make a new batch of syrup and dip the paper in again, or start over entirely and make new strips.",
