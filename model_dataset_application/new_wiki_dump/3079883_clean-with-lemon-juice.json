          "description":"First, wipe away all crumbs and debris from the countertops using a paper towel. Cut a lemon in half crosswise. Then squeeze fresh lemon juice directly from one half of the lemon onto the laminate surface. Rub in the juices using either the remaining lemon half (with the cut-side down) or a cleaning cloth. Once the stains are gone, wipe down the whole area with a damp washcloth. Leave the lemon juice to soak on stubborn food stains for 5 to 10 minutes if necessary. For a deep-clean, remove all items from the countertop before cleaning. This way, you can reach all the nooks and crannies. Avoid using this method to clean porous stone countertops."

          "description":"Sprinkle coarse salt over the surface of a wooden cutting board or chopping block. Then cut a lemon in half and place the cut-side down onto the board. Scrub over the salt and any food stains, using the lemon like a sponge. Leave this lemon-salt solution to soak in for 5 minutes or so, then scrub it with a bristle brush. Finally, rinse off the board under hot water, scrubbing it with the brush to remove any residue. Squeeze out some of the lemon juice as you scrub, and add more salt as it starts to dissolve. The acidity of the juice and the abrasive texture of the salt will work together to remove tough stains. This approach can also work on plastic cutting boards. However, the lemon juice and baking soda process recommended for use on plastic food containers may produce better results."

Sprinkle 1-2 tbsp (14-28 g) of baking soda onto the juice and scrub the resulting paste onto all stained sides of the container. Let it sit for a few hours, or overnight, before cleaning the container with hot water and dish soap. This method works especially well on tomato-based residue and spice stains."

Put the bowl in the microwave and heat it on the high setting for 3 minutes to bring the water to a boil. Keep the microwave closed and leave the steamy lemon-water inside for another 5 minutes. Once the food residue has loosened up, remove the bowl and wipe down all of the microwave\u2019s inside surfaces, including the door and turntable, with a cleaning cloth or sponge. To dislodge any stuck-on pieces, dip a corner of the cleaning cloth or sponge into the lemon-water and use the damp corner to scrub away the food residue. Be careful when removing the bowl and the turntable as they will be hot! Use oven mitts, a potholder, or a towel to protect your hands. You can use a similar technique to clean your oven. Fill a baking dish with water and lemon juice, then leave it in the oven on 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C) for 30 minutes so that the steam can loosen up grimy buildup. Wipe the interior of the oven with a damp sponge after it cools."

Use a cleaning cloth to buff the paste onto the tarnished copper surface. Once the tarnished areas are clean, rinse off the copper with warm water to remove all the lemon paste. Lastly, dry the copper thoroughly with a microfiber cloth or paper towel. This works well for copper pots as well as decorative copper objects. It can also clean stainless steel pots and pans. However, you should refrain from using lemon to polish other types of fine metal. Alternatively, you may sprinkle the salt or baking soda directly onto the sliced lemon. Scrub the lemon over the copper to remove the tarnish, adding more salt or baking soda to the lemon as it dissolves."

Then run a stream of cold water down the drain, turn on the garbage disposal, and drop in 1 lemon piece at a time. The coarse rinds will clean off the blades and the acidic juices will break down food residue while leaving a pleasant, clean smell. You can toss in coarse salt and ice cubes with the lemon pieces as well. Alternate adding in the lemon, salt, and ice cubes continuously as you run the garbage disposal. Salt will work with the lemon juices to eliminate food residue, while ice will help clean off the blades. You can also try freezing small lemon chunks directly into some ice cubes in an ice tray. Add the lemon ice cubes to your garbage disposal along with some coarse salt. This is a great way to use up and dispose of leftover lemons from cooking."

Be careful not to get the mixture on the actual tile. Let the paste sit on the tile grout for 10 minutes or so and then wipe it away with a damp cloth. Finally, rinse off the tile and grout with hot water. Porous tile and stone will be damaged by exposure to acid, so avoid directly cleaning them with lemon juice. Keep a paper towel handy to quickly wipe any lemon paste off of the tile as you go. If you are using this method to clean all of the grout within your floors or shower, you may need to juice upwards of 6 or 7 lemons to create enough bleaching paste. For small patches, the juice of 1 lemon will be sufficient."
