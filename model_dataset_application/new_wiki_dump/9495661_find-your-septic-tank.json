The sewer line will continue underfoot for several feet, until it empties its contents into the septic tank. So, since sewer lines run straight, you can be confident that the septic tank lies in a straight line from the point where the sewer line exits your house.

Walk outwards from your home following the direction of the sewer line, and note any areas that have settled or which are covered with dead grass or extra-wet soil. Since it\u2019s easier to let sewage flow downhill than to pump it uphill, the settled area will typically be downhill from your home. Grass above your septic tank may be dead and brown because, if the tank is not buried very deep, it will keep grass roots from growing far into the soil. Similarly, the surface of the ground above your septic tank may become saturated since water is not able to drain far down into the soil."
