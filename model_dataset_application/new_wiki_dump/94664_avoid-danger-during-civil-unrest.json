Staying home keeps you out of the chaos and also allows you to defend your location, if you need to. Don't go back out to find out what's going on, and don't delay getting home if you're out. You can and should prepare for emergencies, such as civil unrest, bad weather, or any other mass incident. Staying home will allow you to effectively utilize your resources while keeping you safer from danger."

FEMA's guidelines primarily ensure that your safe room is weatherproof. You can, however, fortify your room for additional standards, such as fireproofing or bulletproofing."

Fortifying your home means that you strengthen its barriers, just in case the unrest incident spills over to your location. Invest in a security system that includes outside cameras. This will offer you an additional line of defense. A popular, basic fortification is replacing standard windows with impact-resistant glass."

Make it a point to read up on or listen to what is happening globally, nationally, and locally. Staying informed about current events and any situations that may potentially devolve into civil unrest gives you more time to ensure that you and your family's safety. Many news organizations have applications for smart phones that will send you alerts if big news is breaking in your area. Make sure that you don't just rely on the internet for your information. If a civil unrest situation persists, you may lose internet and cell access. Consider purchasing a battery-operated or hand-crank operated radio to stay informed if you lose electricity. A police scanner will allow you hear police radio traffic, which will alert you to any situations long before they are broadcast by the media."

This especially important because you won't be able to go out and replenish your supplies. Plan ahead, think about what your family needs (not wants), and stockpile appropriately. Make sure that you have enough water for every member of your family. The average adult drinks one half gallon per day, and children, sick people, and pregnant women drink more than that. It's safest to store pre-packaged water, and don't forget to account for your pets too. Store enough food for your family to survive several days, and remember to consider dietary restrictions, such as celiac disease or allergies. Opt for foods with the most nutrition and longest shelf life, such as canned vegetables, stew, and powdered milk. Some foods may even be stored indefinitely. Keep a 30-day supply of medications on hand, if you can, and keep them together so that you can easily stick them in your emergency kit if you need to. It's also a good idea to make a list of all medications your family takes and the dosages. Make sure that you have a fully-functional first-aid kit in your supplies.

For example, you might decide that if a state of emergency is declared, your group will meet at the predetermined location within an hour of the announcement.
