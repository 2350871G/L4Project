The creamy avocado and warm, crunchy toast make a combination that\u2019s hard to beat. If you want to simplify things even more, just sprinkle your avocado toast with sea salt and cracked black pepper and dig in.

Or try unique another unique combination, like gruyere, heirloom tomatoes, avocado, and bean sprouts. You can put just about anything on a bagel, so get creative. It\u2019s all fair game! Bagels can also make great breakfast sandwiches. Just add an egg and your breakfast meat of choice and put a top on it.

Simply halve an avocado, cut the fruit inside into thin slices, and serve the slices alongside the rest of your breakfast. You\u2019ll get all creamy goodness without masking the flavor or having to go through a bunch of complicated prep.

The oily fruit will provide the same rich texture as butter or shortening with up to 40% less saturated fat! Avocado doesn\u2019t coat quite as well as softened butter, so you may need to use slightly more of your wet ingredients to make up the textural difference. Reduce the temperature of the oven by about 25 \u00b0F (\u22124 \u00b0C) if you\u2019re substituting 100% of your fats. This will keep the avocado from browning too fast and impacting the color and flavor of the finished confection."
