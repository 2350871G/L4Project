          "description":"Do your research on famous artists of the past and present. By taking a look at their work, you can try to determine how it lays the foundations for contemporary illustration. When researching famous illustrators:\nTake note of how they use composition, color, and line to bring their art to life. Determine the tone and lines of your favorite artists and try to emulate them by using the same colors or line styles. Research the materials that they used and try to replicate the process by using the same materials. Famous historical illustrators include people like Jean Andr\u00e9 Castaigne, Edwin Austin Abbey, and Rose O'Neill. Some successful contemporary illustrators include Pat Perry, Dagna Majewska, and Mouni Feddag."

          "description":"Visiting art museums and galleries will enable you to view other artist's illustrations in person, which is a different experience than seeing a picture in a book or online. Do a search online to find open art galleries near you. You may want to specify your search so that you can find illustrators that use the same medium or draw the same subject matter as you. Take note of their style and technique and find things that you like in other people's art. Things that you can notice in person that may not be obvious in a photo may include things like the texture of the drawing."

Pick up a graphic novel at a comic book store and take note of the various styles that exist. Art books, on the other hand, allow you to view a variety of different pieces of art from artists that you appreciate in a textbook format. These are good to get if you're unfamiliar with an artist's work or you can't make it a museum. The primary types of graphic novel include, manga, superhero stories, personal narratives, and non-fiction. Some of the most popular graphic novels include titles like Uncle Scrooge, Persepolis, and Maus. Some popular contemporary art books include \"Every Person in New York,\" \"Beastly Verse,\" and \"Beloved Dog.\""

          "description":"Different mediums can open your eyes to new styles of art and inspire your current style. If you are always drawing in only one medium, consider switching to one that you don't use often. For instance, if you always draw in pencil or pen, consider changing to something like pastels or charcoal. While you'll have to adjust your technique to draw, it could inspire your overall style. You can also try doing other art forms like sculpture or painting if you feel like you have illustrator's block."

          "description":"Sometimes artists can get caught up drawing using a particular technique, and it limits their body of work. For instance, if you're always used to drawing in an anime style, it could be holding you back from discovering other things you like to draw. Think outside of the box and draw inspiration from innovative artists around you. Other styles include photorealism, surrealism, abstraction, and manga. If you always draw cartoony, try to draw something realistic. Drawing in different styles can help hone your skills."

          "description":"Different illustrators enjoy drawing different things. Some artists prefer to concentrate on the human form while others prefer to sketch inanimate objects or landscapes. In addition, other illustrators like to draw architecture and some like to draw designs for clothes. Think of what you are trying to get out of your illustrations and decide on the subject matter that you like the most. Some artists are best known for drawing a particular subject, such as Georgia O'Keeffe who is best known for her distinct paintings of flowers."

          "headline":"Express yourself in your drawings.",
          "description":"Think of your emotions and favorite themes while you draw and try to translate that into your art. For example, if you want to convey dark emotions, you can portray that in your art by drawing serious subject matter like a violent or depressing scene. Show your frustration by using sharp, jagged lines. If you want to portray a serene scene, using sweeping bright colors and pick subject matter that will inspire people. Try doing quicker concept pieces instead of obsessing over getting something perfect if you are having a hard time completing a drawing. Try taking thirty or fewer seconds to draw something. Aim to get the form and idea of your subject matter, rather than drawing the minute details. Many artists stick to similar themes, colors, lines, and drawing techniques which distinguish their style from other artists. If you have a block in inspiration, concentrate less on achieving a unique style and focus more on getting your emotions out on paper."

Think about your line thickness and how you'll be using your lines within your work. Ask yourself if you like drawing thick bold lines or would rather draw more intricate and detailed lines. Also determine if your lines are going to be short, sharp, and jagged, or smooth and long. Will your lines be dark and make the outline the focal point, or are colors and details more important for you? Vary your line width throughout a drawing, but try to maintain a cohesive style overall. The way you outline your drawings will influence your style heavily."

          "description":"As an illustrator, color can sometimes play a huge role in the emotions and feelings you can evoke from an illustration. Often, darker tones like dark blue and black and can create an ominous feeling in a drawing while lighter tones like yellow, red, and orange can evoke positive emotions. The intensity and method of application also significantly change the way your drawing turns out. Decide whether color will even play a role in your illustrations as some artists prefer to draw in black and white. You may choose to color your drawings with paint, pastels, or colored pens, or scan them and do color edits in a software program."
