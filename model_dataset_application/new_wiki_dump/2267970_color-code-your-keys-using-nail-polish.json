      "description":"Either approach is fine, as long as it works for you. And bear in mind that painting your keys different colors must actually help you. If you're unlikely to remember what the \u201cred\u201d key is used for, there's little point in painting them. On the positive side, it shouldn't take too long to train yourself to know which color means which door. Choose between painting the entire key head, entire key or just placing a discerning nail polish \u201cdot\u201d at the top of the key. It's not really recommended that you paint the entire key, as the polish will flake over time and it'll end up sitting in your pocket or bag with repeated use. Plus, too much color can look a bit tacky. In general, a small dot, especially in a subtle color like blue, black or even green, can easily organize keys without too much effort or in-your-face glare. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/12\\/Color-Code-Your-Keys-Using-Nail-Polish-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Color-Code-Your-Keys-Using-Nail-Polish-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/12\\/Color-Code-Your-Keys-Using-Nail-Polish-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Color-Code-Your-Keys-Using-Nail-Polish-Step-1Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/2.5\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nConsider adding specific colors to a base color for keys that are used at one spot, but in multiple areas.
