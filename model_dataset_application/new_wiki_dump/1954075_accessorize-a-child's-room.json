          "description":"Make sure that the mattress for the bed is supportive and the right size, and that the pillows are comfortable. Pick warm, cozy bedding for winter, and cooler linens for summer. For younger children especially, transitioning to their own bed can be difficult. Having a special stuffed animal or blanket in their bed with them can help them to feel comfortable and get a good night\u2019s sleep. Consider allowing your child to pick their own bedding or a special blanket. This helps make their new space special to them, and keep the bed feeling cozy."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add a few stuffed animals to the bed.",
          "description":"Stuffed animals will help decorate the room and make your child feel more comfortable when they are trying to get to sleep. The stuffed animals may match the color scheme, or add a bright pattern and pop of color to the room. Extra stuffed animals could be stored in a woven basket, or displayed on shelves."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Install string lights or incandescent bulbs for soft lighting.",
          "description":"Having lights that are too bright in your child\u2019s bedroom, especially just before bedtime, can make it much more difficult for them to get to sleep. Having a soft reading light can help your child to get used to having the main lights off, and will also create a soft and warm atmosphere. If your child uses a nightlight, consider getting one with a red bulb. This dims the light from the nightlight and instead gives a warm glow, which is less activating to your child\u2019s brain. You can adjust the brightness and replace the shades of many lights. This means that you can change out the lighting as your child grows. Check the room for any electronic lights. Once their bedroom is fully dark, tiny electronic lights can really stand out and make it hard to fall asleep. Try facing these towards the wall or covering them if possible."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Hang blackout curtains or window shades.",
          "description":"Blocking out as much light during sleeping hours is key to getting a full night\u2019s sleep. Blackout curtains or window shades will block out the late sunlight during summer months and also streetlights, to create a healthy sleeping environment. If you don\u2019t want to purchase whole new curtains or window shades, you can also buy blackout curtain liners which attach to regular curtains, or blackout shades with suction cups that can attach to windows. You can buy these products from many homeware and curtain stores. Blackout curtains are a great option because they allow you to open the shades during the day to let in natural light, which is important to creating a sense of comfort. Then, at night, you can close the shades to block unwanted light."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Include a fan in warmer months and a heater in cooler months.",
          "description":"Having a comfortable temperature in the bedroom is essential for your child to get a good night's sleep. The optimal temperature for sleep is 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C), and this can have a big impact on the quality of sleep your child is getting. Fans and heaters aren't the only options for adjusting the temperature to make it more sleep-friendly. Extra blankets and comforters, air conditioning, or keeping the window open if possible can also work wonders. If the area in which you live tends to dry out during a certain season, a humidifier may also be beneficial for climate control. This keeps the room from getting too dry and can help prevent discomfort caused by dry air such as raw nasal passages and sore throats."

It will also become a natural space for play in the bedroom if you have a hard floor. Not only do rugs add to the aesthetic value of your child\u2019s bedroom, but they also can help protect younger children from falls. Rugs can help to cushion any tumbles onto a hard floor, and enhance the safety of their bedroom."

          "description":"Vinyl wall art is fairly inexpensive, and it comes in a wide range of colors. These stickers can also be easily peeled off without damaging the walls when your child feels that they have outgrown the current look. There are a wide variety of wall stickers available to appeal to a range of different decors, from baby, to character, to galaxy themes. 3D wall stickers are also a popular and exciting way to decorate a child's bedroom. Give your child a chance to pick what vinyls you will put up. You can narrow down some options and let your kid choose from those, or just let them run wild. This helps get them excited about spending time in their new room."

          "description":"Decorate your child\u2019s space with their own creativity and imagination to show them that their work is valued and important. You could frame each piece to create a curated gallery wall, or simply peg each piece to a hanging length of string. You can also hang a rope up on a wall and clip your child's new artwork to it using clothespins. Hang the rope up high enough so that your child can't get tangled in or otherwise compromise their safety. To expand the artwork in your child\u2019s room beyond their own, consider youthful wall prints and pictures. Florals, animals, flags, and lettering can also make fun, personal additions."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Put a potted plant or two in your child's room.",
          "description":"A touch of greenery will help to make the space appear fresh and bright. A plant will help to teach responsibility, and will add a touch of creativity. Succulents work well for a kid's room because they don't require too much watering, yet come in many different fun and exciting patterns and shapes. Avoid plants that could harm your child, such as a spiky cactus. If real plants are too difficult, invest in a fake plant instead."

Shelving comes in a variety of different materials such as metal, wire or painted wood, and can be accessorized to match the decor of the room. You can find shelving at many department, homeware, and hardware stores. Shelves don\u2019t have to be for purely decorative items. You can use shelves that are within easy reach to display favorite books and toys, and also to showcase your child's interests. Don't put heavy items on them, though, as these may fall and pose a safety hazard. Shelves can be placed in many different areas of the room, including above windows, dressers, and desks. Generally, though, it's best to avoid hanging shelves directly above the bed."

Storage bins can be kept within shelving, wooden cubes, in a wardrobe, or on the floor. You can even get bins that slide under the bed."

If the bookcase is large, make sure to secure it to the wall for safety. You could create a reading nook by placing a few comfy pillows in a corner, and filling a low shelf with your child\u2019s favorite titles."

Some beds come with built-in drawers for extra storage space. However if you child's bed doesn't have these, you can buy long plastic storage containers from most department stores which are designed to fit perfectly beneath a bed."

An alarm clock or timer can help if there is a designated study time for older children, such as between 4:00 - 4:30 pm. This will help them know when to start and when to stop."
