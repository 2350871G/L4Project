  "text":" Understanding Parts of Speech Differentiate nouns and pronouns. Identify nouns as words that denote a thing or person (such as man, sky, clothes, teacher, friend).

For example:\nTake the sentence \u201cThe man was both my teacher and friend.\u201d Man, teacher, and friend are all nouns. However, if you were to say, \u201cHe was both my teacher and friend,\u201d teacher and friend would still be nouns, while he is a pronoun since it is taking the place of man. Identify verbs. Recognize these as the words that either denote an action or a state of being within a sentence. When a verb is active, it describes what a noun does. When it describes a state of being, it links the noun to another word that describes the noun\u2019s state of being. For instance:\nIn the sentence, \u201cThe man teaches,\u201d teach is an active verb describing what the noun man does.
