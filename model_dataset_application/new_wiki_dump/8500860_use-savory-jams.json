Stir the melted jam into the cornbread batter and bake it according to your recipe. For a decorative swirl, avoid completely combining the jam with the batter. Instead, spoon the jam across the batter in the pan and use a knife to gently swirl the jam in."

          "description":"Scramble a pan full of eggs with your favorite breakfast burrito ingredients (like onions, mushrooms, and peppers). Once the eggs begin to set, stir in several tablespoons of a savory jam. Continue to cook the scrambled eggs until they're firm and then roll them up in a flour tortilla. Don't worry if the eggs seem really wet after you add the jam. They'll firm up as the eggs finish cooking."

Use a pastry brush to spread a savory jam over ham, chicken, pork tenderloin, or salmon. Glaze the dish during the last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time. If you glaze a large roast when it starts cooking, the glaze could burn because the roast needs to cook for so long. That's why it's important to wait till the end of the cooking time."

You can add it to marinara or basic white sauces. Toss the noodles with the sauce until they're coated. For example, you could make a basic fettuccine alfredo, but add garlic jam to the sauce for an even stronger flavor."

Top the pizza dough or flatbread with a few simple ingredients, so you don't overwhelm the flavors of the jam. For example, use a roasted red pepper jam with fresh mozzarella and basil. You could also use pineapple sriracha jam on a pizza with ham and cheese for a fresh take on a Hawaiian pizza."
