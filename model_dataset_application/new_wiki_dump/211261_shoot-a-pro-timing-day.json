Linemen can be shot from ground level or an elevated position\nThe other positions should be shot from an elevated position. Quarterbacks are often shot with a second camera while throwing to the receivers. Kickers and punters should be shot from the ground and an elevated position. Video from above should show distance and placement of kicks."
