With just a few supplies, you can easily help your child make a tissue paper butterfly, tissue paper suncatchers, or pompoms that make great table centerpieces. You and your child can also have fun making tissue paper flowers, such as poppies or roses, that you can display in a vase. Use different colors of tissue paper for more colorful creations, or use all the same color for a more uniform, simple look.

Then, roll the bead tightly together from the wide part in to the skinniest part (where the glue is). Hold the glued edge down for about 30 seconds to make sure that it sticks. Repeat this process until you have enough beads to thread onto string and make a necklace at your desired length. To make your beads last longer and give them a little shine, use a paintbrush to apply a coat of ModPodge over each bead. Hold the string up or tie it up and let it hang until the ModPodge is completely dry. For long, skinny beads, cut the triangles to be 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide with 4 inches (10 cm) sides. For shorter, fatter beads, cut your triangles about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) wide at the base with the sides measuring 6 inches (15 cm)."
