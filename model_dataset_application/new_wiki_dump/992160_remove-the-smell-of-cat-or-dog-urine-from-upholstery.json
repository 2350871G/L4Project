          "description":"It can become extremely tricky to remove urine if your pet's urine soaks deep into the upholstery and even into the wood frame. In most cases, you can spot the urine spot right away. If not, you can try:\nUsing your nose. Pet urine has a very distinct smell and often smells like ammonia. Using a blacklight. Because of its chemical properties, pet urine shows up under a blacklight, specifically its scent-creating chemicals even when the stain has been dried or are days old. Outline these area in chalk or mark then with a sticky note to help you clean then when you turn on the lights."

You can place the soaked up newspaper or paper towel where you'd like your pet to urinate. This is a positive way to help let them know where to urinate as you'll be transferring their urine smell to the appropriate location."

          "description":"Leave it to sit for 10 to 15 minutes and then blot up as much cleaner as you can with newspapers, a towel, or paper towels. Finally, leave it to dry. You may need to repeat this step again if the enzymatic cleaner doesn't get rid of the odor or stain the first time. Urine is composed of things that require enzymes to break down its chemical bonds. For example, when a pet pees, urea in their urine breaks down into a bacteria that produces the distinct scent of urine. As the urine is left longer to decompose, the smells become worse. Fortunately, most chemicals in urine are easily removed by water and other household detergents. However, uric acid is the only component that is not water soluble and must be broken down by enzymes."

          "description":"Some pet owners will cover the area loosely with aluminum foil or lay their laundry basket upside down over the stain to prevent their pets from urinating in the area again. It also helps to remind family members not to step or sit on the stain while it dries. It can take a long time, even days, for the stain to completely dry, especially if the stain is particularly deep and more enzymatic cleaner was needed. Aluminum foil is a great deterrent tool to use to discourage your pet from urinating in the upholstery again. The crinkly sound and feel of foil when your pet steps on it is not pleasing to your pet or might even scare them off of the upholstery completely. For pillows or cushions, you can leave them out in the sun to dry as long as you can."

These alternative methods are good to use if you don't have enzymatic cleaner on hand at the moment of the incident. Eventually, you will need to clean the area with enzymatic cleaner.

Separately, baking soda helps to eliminate odors while  vinegar sanitizes and removes deposits. There are several steps to using this cleaner:\nSoak up as much urine as possible from the upholstery before you use any cleaning agent. Sprinkle baking soda on the stain and let it sit for 5 minutes. The baking soda will work to deodorize the stain. In a spray bottle, mix equal parts of water and distilled white vinegar. Alternatively, you can just use a container or a bowl. Spray or pour the water and vinegar mixture directly onto the baking soda-covered stain. Let it sit for another 5 minutes. Blot the stain with a towel or paper towel to dry. Use vinegar cautiously by thoroughly diluting it with water and only using it with baking soda, rather than separately. Strong chemical odors, including vinegar, can encourage some dogs to reinforce scent marks."
