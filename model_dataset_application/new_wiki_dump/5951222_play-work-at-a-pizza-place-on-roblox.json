Working as a Cook Look at the board at the back of the kitchen. When the Cashier makes a successful order, the order will automatically appear on the board.

This building should have trucks inside or nearby. Inside the building, there should be an array of colourful buttons and a graph that shows the number of supplies at the pizza restaurant. Step on the buttons. A cube that is the same color as the button will pop up on a nearby conveyor belt. Depending on the item, these cubes represent 2-5 portions. Don't stand on one button for too long, though, as cubes will flood out onto the conveyor. Drag the boxes into the back of your truck.
