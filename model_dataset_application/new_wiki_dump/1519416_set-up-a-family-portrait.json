The exact time of day will vary based on season and location, but a good rule of thumb for golden hour is the first hour after sunrise, and the last hour before sunset. To calculate golden hour, look up local sunrise and sunset time. If you want to shoot in the morning, start just before sunrise and shoot for the entire hour to get the breadth of golden hour effects. For evening golden hour shots, start an hour before sunset."

This allows everyone to fit into the frame if you have a large family. Try to fit everyone in a straight line. Ensuring that everyone is in a line will help everyone be on the same depth of field so no one goes out of focus. Put taller people in the center of the line and shorter people at the edges of the group. If you need to make two rows, have the taller family members stand in the back and the shorter members in front. Stagger the height of your family's heads.
