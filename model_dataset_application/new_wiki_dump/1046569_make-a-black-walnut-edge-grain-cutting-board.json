If the board soaks up the oil right away add more to surface and let stand, after 15 minutes remove any excess oil from the surface with a clean paper towel. This process will protect your board against moisture and extend the life of all your cutting boards."

  "text":" Cut your walnut lumber into 12 strips 1 \u00bd\u201d wide x 15\u201d long on your table saw. Make sure you have a sharp blade that makes a smooth 90 degree cut, because you have to glue these strips together to make your cutting board. Now take the twelve  1 \u00bd\u201d wide strips and place them beside each other making a board 9\u201d wide by 15\u201d long by 1 3/8\u201d thick. It is also a good idea to turn the grain of each piece (end grain) 90-degrees to the one next to it, for both strength and to enhance the look. Now that you have the boards laid out like you want it take your pencil and make two wavy lines through the width of the board. This way you have a reference on each joint during the gluing process so you don\u2019t have to worry, do I have the strip turned the correct way. You can also number each board if you like. Next set up your bar clamps and get the glue ready (I suggest you use Titebond glue this glue has been approved for use in making cutting boards). Apply glue to one side of each strip and smooth it out with your finger or a putty knife making sure the entire surface has been covered. Carefully assembled the twelve strips to minimize cutting problems later (squaring across the top of the board will make the assembly easier with less sanding) and applied clamping pressure, add just enough pressure to pull the joints together.
