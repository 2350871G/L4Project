She has catered events and hosted pop-up dinners in the San Francisco Bay Area for over 5 years. VT\t\t\tEXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tVanna Tran, an experienced cook, says: \"That totally depends on what cut of beef you're cooking. Something with a lot of connective tissue and collagen, like short ribs or oxtail, need to cook low and slow in a braising liquid for several hours. However, something with very little collagen, like a strip steak, might only need 10-12 minutes on a hot grill to achieve a tender medium rare.\""

This process breaks up the connective tissues in the meat. While it isn't good for things like grilled steak, it works well for a meat that's breaded, like chicken-fried steak."

This method also works well for chuck roast or bottom round. For an easy way to do this method, use a slow cooker. You can also use a grill or an oven, as long as you keep the heat low. You will need to cook the meat for at least an hour per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of beef at about 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C)."

          "description":"You only need a small amount of baking soda, as little as a 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 g). Add it to \u20444 pound (0.34 kg) of meat that hasn't been sliced or cut. Add just enough water to cover the beef in a narrow bowl or pan, and soak the meat for 15 minutes. Dry the meat off if your frying or grilling it so you can get a nice sear. The baking soda changes the pH of the meat's surface. In turn, it can't bind together as tightly, which makes it more tender. If the meat is cut into several pieces, use 1 teaspoon (6 g) of baking soda. You can use this method on whole cuts of beef as well as on ground beef. Soak the beef up to an hour with no ill effects."

This method will draw water to the surface, which you rinse off. It leaves behind the juicy fats and proteins, making it more tender and flavorful. It also helps get salt to the inside of the meat.
