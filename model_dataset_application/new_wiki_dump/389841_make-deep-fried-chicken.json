          "description":"Combine 1 US-quart (950 ml) (.9 liters) buttermilk, 4 teaspoons salt, and one teaspoon of pepper into a large bowl. Stir the ingredients to combine them. Next, place all of the chicken pieces into the marinade, pressing them into the liquid to completely coat them. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for 4-24 hours. Wash any surfaces that touched raw chicken, including your hands."

          "description":"If you try to fry cold chicken, your chicken pieces will cook unevenly. To reheat the chicken, place the bowl of chicken and marinade on your kitchen counter for thirty minutes. Don\u2019t leave your chicken out for more than thirty minutes. If you do, the chicken may go bad."

          "headline":"Combine the dry ingredients.",
          "description":"Place an extra-large re-sealable plastic bag on your counter. Combine 2 cups (240 grams) of all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of baking powder, 1 tablespoon of garlic powder, and one tablespoon of onion powder in the re-sealable bag. Close the bag and shake it thoroughly to incorporate the ingredients. If desired, add additional seasoning. For example:\nAdd a teaspoon of paprika or cayenne for a spicy kick. For Cajun fried chicken, add 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper, and 5 dashes of Louisiana hot sauce. Add 2 teaspoons crumbled dried oregano, 2 teaspoons crumbled dried sage, and 2 teaspoons crumbled dried thyme to add an herbal fragrance to the fried chicken."

          "headline":"Coat the chicken in flour.",
          "description":"Use tongs or clean fingers to move a piece of chicken from the marinade into the re-sealable bag of flour. Seal the bag and shake it well to coat the chicken in flour. Open the bag and transfer the floury chicken to a plate. Repeat this step for each piece of chicken. Coat one piece of chicken at a time to avoid incorporating any liquid into the flour."

        {
          "headline":"Coat the chicken again.",
          "description":"Once all of the pieces have gotten their first coat of flour, repeat the coating process. First, gently dip a floury piece of chicken in the marinade to moisten the surface. Next, place the piece of chicken back in the flour bag. Shake the bag to completely coat the chicken with a second layer of flour. Repeat this step for the rest of the chicken pieces. Place the freshly coated chicken pieces on a new plate. This will help you know which pieces you\u2019ve already coated twice. Coat one piece of chicken at a time. If you don\u2019t, the flour bag will absorb too much moisture and will become a thick batter."

After a few minutes, test the temperature of the oil. For an exact measurement, use a candy thermometer to find the oil temperature. Follow the manufacturer instructions when using a thermometer. If you don\u2019t have a candy thermometer, place a wooden spoon into the hot oil. If the oil bubbles around the spoon, the oil is hot enough. Alternatively, throw a pinch of flour into the oil. If the oil bubbles around the flour, the oil is hot enough. If it turns black within a few minutes, the oil is too hot. Reduce the heat slightly."

Reduce the temperature. After about fifteen minutes of frying, look for signs that the chicken is ready. For example:\nProperly fried chicken has a golden-brown crust. Clear juices will leak out of the chicken, even when it\u2019s frying in the oil. If the chicken isn\u2019t done, pink juices will leak out of it. Dark meat takes more time to cook than light meat. Keep an eye on any chicken breasts or wings."

To do so, stick the metal end of the thermometer into the thickest part of the biggest piece of chicken. The temperature should be at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius.) If you don\u2019t have a meat thermometer, check the chicken by cutting into the largest part with a knife. If the meat appears raw, cook the chicken for a few more minutes."

However, this method will steam the surface of the chicken, creating soggy fried pieces. Instead, place the fried chicken on a wire rack set on a baking sheet. This will allow the chicken to become crispy and delicious. Let the chicken cool for ten minutes before serving. You can pat the chicken with paper towels to remove some excess grease."
