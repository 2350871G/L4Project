          "description":"Vegetables are designated either \"warm-season\" or \"cool-season,\" depending on the weather they need in order to grow. Warm-season vegetables require warm soil and high temperatures, and will usually be killed by frost. They should be planted after the average date of the last spring frost. Popular warm-season vegetables include snap beans, corn, cucumbers, cantaloupes, peppers, and tomatoes. To find the average date of the last frost in your area, visit https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates."

They can usually endure some frost, and will often turn bitter in hot weather. You can plant them in the very early spring to harvest in the early summer, or plant them in late summer for fall harvest. Popular cool-season vegetables include beets, broccoli, carrots, peas, and strawberries."

This zone map is printed on the back of most seed packets and can be used to tell you when to plant a certain vegetable, as well as whether a specific vegetable will survive in your climate. You can view the USDA zone map by visiting http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/ . Similar maps have been produced for other countries based on the guidelines developed for the USDA map.

Drought-resistant vegetable varieties for the West Coast include Armenian cucumber, Jackson Wonder lima beans, Gold Coast okra, and Anasazi Sweet corn. Some vegetables, like hot peppers and green beans, grow better in drier conditions, so make sure your area's annual rainfall doesn't exceed the plant's water needs, which can be found on a seed packet or by searching online.

In addition to providing a low-maintenance option for your garden, native produce is usually inexpensive, and you can often find both seeds and seedlings at your local farmer\u2019s market or a local garden center."

Vining plants include cucumbers, green beans, and peas. Growing your vining plants on a trellis will also help reduce pest problems and make it easier to harvest your vegetables. Another option if you don't have much space is to plant your garden in containers. Tomatoes, strawberries, radishes, lettuce, and herbs all grow well in pots."

Many vegetables grow well in soil that is slightly sandy, although you may need to add compost or manure if you notice that your garden seems dry soon after you water it. Plants which grow well in sandy soil include dill, sweet potatoes, green beans, and leafy vegetables. Putting a layer of mulch (such as chopped straw) on top of the soil around the plants can help retain water."

          "description":"If your soil feels greasy when it\u2019s wet, then you have clay soil. Clay is very dense and it tends to hold water, so the plants you choose will have to tolerate a lot of water. Vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage often do well in clay soil because they grow better when their roots are firmly anchored in the earth. Squash, pumpkins, and rice also do well in clay soil. You can help loosen clay soil by adding chunky organic matter like garden compost or chopped leaves to the earth between plantings."

If you have an area that doesn\u2019t get as much light, fill that spot with plants that prefer getting a little break from the sun. Vegetables that will grow well in shade include carrots, peas, potatoes, radishes, and a number of greens, including arugula, cabbage, chard, kale, and escarole."

          "description":"If you don\u2019t have a lot of experience gardening, you might not have much luck with finicky, slow-growing vegetables. Instead, choose plants which can be harvested quickly so you don\u2019t get frustrated. Loose-leaf lettuce plants, like spinach, arugula, and mustard greens, can be harvested as soon as 3 weeks after you planted them, and then they\u2019ll be ready for a second harvest about 2 weeks later. Radishes are another great option for beginners. They grow quickly, can be grown in small containers, and are frost tolerant. However, be sure to plant them early in spring (4-6 weeks before the last frost), because they grow best in cool weather."

          "description":"Some plants grow better when they\u2019re paired with each other, a practice called companion planting. This is sometimes because one plant produces a chemical that repels insects and protects the other plant, or the plants may use different chemicals from the soil, allowing them both to get plenty of food even when they're grown close together. You can find information on companion plants in gardening books or by searching online. For instance, tomatoes grow very well when planted near basil, carrots, celery, lettuce, or peppers. However, they should not be planted near broccoli, kale, corn or potatoes. Beans grow well near broccoli, cabbage, cucumbers, and tomatoes, but should be planted at least 4 feet (1.2 m) away from garlic, onions, peppers, and sunflowers."

          "description":"While some companion plants encourage each other to grow, others are great for helping get rid of insects that can destroy your crops. They may do this by repelling the insects, or in some cases, the bugs may prefer the companion plant, so they ignore the other plants in your garden. Marigolds are bright and cheerful, but they can also repel slugs, beetles, nematodes, and even deer, all of which can devastate a vegetable garden. Nasturtium is another helpful flower to add to the garden. Aphids are especially fond of nasturtiums and will ignore other plants if the flowers are around. In addition, nasturtiums are edible, with a flavor similar to that of arugula."

This will help you as you\u2019re planning how much space to devote to each vegetable in your garden. Plants like tomatoes, peppers, and squash keep providing throughout the season, so you may not need as many plants. Carrots, radishes, and corn produce only once, so if you plan on eating a lot of these, you may need to devote a bigger portion of your garden to them."

In addition, certain herbs can act as companion plants for your vegetables. For instance, when you plant dill and basil near your tomatoes, the herbs can discourage tomato hornworms."
