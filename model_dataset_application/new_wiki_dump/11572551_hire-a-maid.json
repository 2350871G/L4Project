          "description":"An independent maid works for themselves, not a company. Since they're only responsible for themselves, independent maids are often cheaper than maid companies, but they do have downsides too. It may be more difficult to find out the details about an independent maid's training or background, so you'll want to look at their reviews more heavily to see if they come recommended. Type \"independent maids near me\" or something similar into an online search bar to find maid options to look through."

Maid companies are often more expensive and might not be as flexible in regards to your cleaning wishes as an independent maid. Look for maid companies near you online to find out the prices of each one."

They\u2019ll be able to tell you details about the maid like how much it might cost and how good of a job they do. Post on social media asking friends and family members for maid recommendations, or talk to your coworkers about a maid service they\u2019ve used and liked. Some maids may even offer you a discount if you are referred to them by someone you know."

Check the maid\u2019s website to see if they\u2019re bonded and insured, or call to ask them if you\u2019re not sure. It also protects your maid if they have an injury while cleaning your house so neither of you have to pay out of pocket."

Ask the potential maid about their training and past experiences cleaning, and consider doing your own background check on them. Ask for the contact information for a couple of their professional references so you can talk to their past employers. If you\u2019re hiring your maid through a company, they\u2019ve likely already done a background check on the maid. There are websites you can use to conduct background checks on people, though some of them will require a fee. For a more informal background check, try typing their full name into Google to see what comes up, such as their social media pages. Call or email the maid's professional references, telling them why you're calling and asking questions about whether the maid was on time, the quality of the cleaning, and so on."

The walkthrough is also a good time to bring up anything you\u2019re concerned about, such as being super gentle with the china cabinet or making sure the kitchen sink is extra clean.

This is a good idea if you have certain products you like to use in your house, and it often makes the cost of the maid service go down since they\u2019re not having to use their own supply of products. For example, if you only wanted to use bleach-free products in your home, it would be a good idea to tell your maid this and provide the cleaning supplies for them to use. Before deciding on a set price that you\u2019ll pay the maid, ask them what the different in cost would be if you supplied your own cleaning products, if desired."

Talk with your maid about exactly which rooms you'd like cleaned and if you're looking for extra things like washing and folding the laundry. You might write out a list for your maid of which rooms should be cleaned and what services you're asking for in each room. For example, a bedroom might need vacuuming, dusting, and the bed to be made. The more services you ask your maid to complete, the higher the price will likely be."
