          "description":"A flat sheet is a sheet that is rectangular in shape, with no elastics or rounded corners; it is different from a fitted sheet, which has rounded, stretchy corners made for hugging your mattress. If you have a fitted sheet, place this on the bed first before laying your flat sheet on top of it. Then, lay your flat sheet out on your bed with three sides of the sheet hanging off the mattress at the sides and foot of the bed. Align the top of the flat sheet with the top of the mattress (at the head of your bed) so that it is flush with the mattress, not hanging over it. If you do not have a fitted sheet, place the flat sheet over the mattress so that all of its sides hang evenly over the mattress (at the sides, head and foot of the bed)."

Once you have put the mattress back down, slide your hand (or, if you prefer, both hands) between the mattress and boxspring (or base) to ensure that sheet is smooth and not bunching anywhere. You might also tug lightly on the outer ends of the sheet that are still hanging down on either side of the mattress to help keep the sheet taut and smooth. If you do not have a fitted sheet and are using the flat sheet to lie on top of once you\u2019re in bed, repeat this process at the head of the bed, lifting the mattress slightly and tucking the top end of the flat sheet beneath the mattress."

The sheet covering your mattress could be either a fitted sheet or a flat sheet that has already been folded into hospital corners (as per the \u201cFolding Hospital Corners\u201d method). Place a flat sheet on top of your mattress, aligning the top of your sheet with the top edge of your mattress.  Make sure the sheet hangs down equally on both sides of your bed.

Be sure to hold the sheet and blanket together as you tuck them underneath the mattress. Run your hand along the top of the bed to smooth out any wrinkles.  Adding a Pillow Cover to a Military Style Bed Place your pillow at the top of your bed. Tuck any excess fabric from the pillow case beneath the pillow as you place it on the exposed sheet at the head of your bed. The pillow should sit on the exposed sheet that you will sleep on. It should sit above the flat sheet and blanket that you\u2019ve just folded down on top of your bed. Fold another blanket in half vertically. This blanket should be similar to, if not the same as, the top blanket of your bed. To fold something in half vertically means to fold it so that the long sides are touching. Place the blanket width-wise across the top of your bed. It should cover your pillow and hang down equally on both sides of the bed. The top of the blanket should hang several inches over the head of your bed. Ensure that the blanket still reaches down far enough below your pillow so that it covers both the pillow and the folded sheet/blanket just beneath your pillow. Fold the blanket into hospital corners at the top of the bed. Just as you\u2019ve done in previous steps, fold the blanket into hospital corners at the two top corners of your bed.
