Pursuing a degree can give you a well-rounded and general knowledge of jewelry-making or help you choose a specialization, such as design or metallurgy. In a jeweler degree program, you'll learn how to make and repair jewelry, set stones of different sizes, and work with new technologies for more precise cutting. Search for jeweler degree programs online. Most offer applications that can be filled out and sent in online. There are programs across the country and the world, in countries including Italy, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Study different styles of jewelry in your free time. Ylva Bosemark, a jewelry designer and entrepreneur, says: \"When I started, I didn't even think about the huge variety of jewelry that was available. It's amazing and incredible to go and look for different styles that are out there.\""

Some jewelers get their start after earning a degree in another field and growing a jewelry business as a side hobby.

For example, you could work regular shift as a salesperson in the retail store, but ask to come in after hours or on days off to observe the jeweler at work.
