Use white to help balance out other colors and keep a room from being too overwhelming. Other neutral colors include creams, grays, and even black.

Add even more variety to your room by using complementary color families. For example, instead of using blue and orange in a room, diversity with navy, baby blue and cerulean complementing blood tangerine, rust, and coral. Use paint chips and color wheels to find your favorite shades."

For example, if you have a blue and orange foyer, consider making blue one of the prominent color families on display in the next room, and having orange reappear later in your house. This also makes purchasing paint, furniture, and especially accessories easier, because they fit in multiple rooms."

Choose one or two stand-out patterns that appeal to you, and then stick to mainly solid colors to compliment those bolder styles. Common patterns for home decorating include thick stripes, gingham, quatrefoil, and animal print. Chevron and geometric patterns are recent hits."

To cut down on cost, consider painting one accent wall instead of redoing the whole room.
