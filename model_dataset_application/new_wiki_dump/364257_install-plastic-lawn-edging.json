You can purchase edging from most gardening centers and home improvement stores. Plastic lawn edging is commonly sold in 20 ft (6.1 m) lengths. The height of plastic lawn edging varies across brands. It typically ranges from 3\u20136 in (7.6\u201315.2 cm) high. Generally, 3 in (7.6 cm) edging is inexpensive and widely available, yet short enough for the grass rhizomes to easily grow into the garden bed, while 6 in (15 cm) is more expensive and difficult to find, yet will make garden bed maintenance easier in the long run."

Keep the soil that you have dug up close by, as you'll be using it again soon. The width of the trench must be slightly larger than the width of the edging. Although it depends on the width of your particular edging, approximately 2 in (5.1 cm) is normally sufficient. You can use a rototiller rather than a shovel if you prefer."
