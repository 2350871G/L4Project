Line a fine-mesh strainer with muslin, cheesecloth, a clean dish towel, or even a clean cotton shirt. Place the strainer over a bowl, and pour the water through the strainer to remove the particles. Note that straining the water like this will only remove large particulates, not pathogens, heavy metals or other contaminants."

          "description":"When you don\u2019t have access to anything that you can use to filter the water, you can remove large particulate from water by letting it settle. Collect the water in a bowl or jar. Leave the water to settle for one to two hours. During this time, heavier particles will sink to the bottom, and lighter material will float to the top. To remove lightweight particles, skim them from the surface of the water. To remove heavier sediment, gently and slowly pour the water into a clean bowl or jar. Stop pouring before you get to the bottom, as this will leave the heavier sediment behind in the original container."
