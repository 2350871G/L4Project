Use a pitchfork to gently turn over the dirt or soil underneath the plant so you can pull out the roots, which can grow to 10 ft (3.0 m) deep. It\u2019s important that you remove the roots to discourage new shoots from growing. Dispose of both the roots and the plant immediately in the trash. If you can\u2019t dig out the roots because of other plants nearby, use a hoe to cut off the bindweed at ground level. Repeat the process as new growth appears. It's best to dispose of it in the trash. If you compost the bindweed, it could spread to your compost bin."

Liberally spray the plants, especially where the roots come up from the ground, then allow the weedkiller to soak into the root system. Use 2 or 3 applications in a single growing season to ensure the bindweed will be destroyed. Glyphosate weedkiller will destroy other plants, like flowers and vegetables, so be sure to spray it only on the bindweed. Glyphosate weedkiller can be found at garden centers and superstores and also comes in a gel that you can paint on individual leaves."
