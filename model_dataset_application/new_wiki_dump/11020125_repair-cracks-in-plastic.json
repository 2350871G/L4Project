Plastic glue is often used for making models so it is easy to use and safe to handle for adults. Make sure you have enough to connect the whole crack, you don\u2019t want to have to stop after you\u2019ve started applying strong glue!

Keep a cloth or wipe nearby in case you pour too much and dab any excess glue immediately to prevent it from hardening. Glue dries fast to be sure you are ready to connect the cracked plastic before you start applying! Strong glues have strong fumes.

You can use a C-clamp to hold the crack together when you submerge it in the cold water, just be sure not to squish the plastic so it\u2019s uneven when it sets.
