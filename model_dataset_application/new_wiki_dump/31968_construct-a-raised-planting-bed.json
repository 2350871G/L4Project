To mount the arches:\nCut sections of stiff 1 in (2.5 cm) pipe to the same length as the height of the frame (e.g., 18 inches (46 cm)). Use clamps and screws to attach 2 sections of 1 in (2.5 cm) tube opposite each other on the inside of the frame anywhere you want to install an arch. For example, you might install these tubes at both ends and the middle of the planter frame.
