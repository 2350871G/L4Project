You will also need two large bowls and a whisk. Melt the butter by microwaving it in a microwave safe container for thirty seconds. You can use fresh or frozen blueberries.

After you\u2019re done mixing the batter, you can either fold in the blueberries or wait to add them until you cook the pancake. If you fold in the blueberries, the blueberries will be unevenly distributed. Many cooks prefer to add the blueberries later to control the blueberry-to-pancake ratio."
