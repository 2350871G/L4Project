Position the pieces ensuring the wet, skinless sides are in the air. It may take up to 1-2 hours for the potatoes to properly dry. They are ready when the cut pieces are no longer wet when touched. Planting the Potatoes Dig holes in the ground to plant the cut potato pieces. Just make sure they aren't cramped together. Place the potato pieces in the holes and cover lightly with soil. The cut side is facing down, the tubers are facing upwards. Spray the soil and always keep it wet. Sometimes when watering the potato is exposed, cover the potato with more soil. Caring and Harvesting Watch for sprouting. After a few days, green sprouts will appear from the ground. Ensure that the soil remains moist. The soil must always be wet. When the tubers branch out into green stems, water with about 1\u20132 inches (3\u20135 cm) of water. \"Hill\" the plant by adding more soil, as the stems grow taller.
