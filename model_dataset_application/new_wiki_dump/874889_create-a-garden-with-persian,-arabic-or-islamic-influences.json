      "headline":"Install a central water feature, such as a pond, rill, or a reflection pond.",
      "description":"While having fountains is fine, fountains tend to be a more modern invention because fountains were an extravagance in desert culture. Small fountains are probably the best compromise for both saving water and for being in keeping with the original styles. Water channels with small fountains are common in gardens in India, Pakistan, and Iran. Often there are four streams, or the pond points in four directions. This derives from the classical, \"Chahar Bagh\" layout, which has a fountain at the centre of the garden that flows into four water channels at right angles with one another. These four water channels are associated with the four rivers of Paradise. The four-quartered garden design is also very water efficient as it makes the most of water moving through a grid pattern. Round ponds are not as common as geometrically shaped ones in more formal gardens. It really depends on your space and your budget (the less usual shape and mosaics can be pricey) as to whether or not you can accommodate a geometrically shaped pond. Turquoise or jade coloured tiles are used frequently with water features. If you can use this colour when laying tiles, it will reflect beautiful blues in your garden."

There is not a great deal of reliance on delicate, pastel colours. Consider painting wall panels, arches, to match the colours just described, or install coloured pots to reflect the colour theme."

Install a central water feature, such as a pond, rill, or a reflection pond. While having fountains is fine, fountains tend to be a more modern invention because fountains were an extravagance in desert culture. Small fountains are probably the best compromise for both saving water and for being in keeping with the original styles. Water channels with small fountains are common in gardens in India, Pakistan, and Iran. Often there are four streams, or the pond points in four directions. This derives from the classical, \"Chahar Bagh\" layout, which has a fountain at the centre of the garden that flows into four water channels at right angles with one another. These four water channels are associated with the four rivers of Paradise. The four-quartered garden design is also very water efficient as it makes the most of water moving through a grid pattern. Round ponds are not as common as geometrically shaped ones in more formal gardens. It really depends on your space and your budget (the less usual shape and mosaics can be pricey) as to whether or not you can accommodate a geometrically shaped pond. Turquoise or jade coloured tiles are used frequently with water features. If you can use this colour when laying tiles, it will reflect beautiful blues in your garden. Install a tile mosaic. Often you can mount the tile mosaic directly on existing blank walls. Bathroom tiling firms occasionally can do this service from their product range but it is fun to try making your own - see wikiHow's article on making a mosaic from broken tiles for an initial idea. Select the appropriate colours. The colours most frequently found in Islamic, Arabic, or Persian inspired garden design are whites, dusky pinks/terracotta, rich blues, golds (occasionally in small patterns), and rich reds. There is not a great deal of reliance on delicate, pastel colours. Consider painting wall panels, arches, to match the colours just described, or install coloured pots to reflect the colour theme. Keep the garden well-maintained. The moment it appears forgotten, it's a fine balance between adding to its charm, or looking derelict, and it's hard to plan which result you'll end up with! So, err on the side of maintaining a tidy garden at all times. This might mean budgeting a gardener into the overall upkeep, so keep this in mind when planning.",
