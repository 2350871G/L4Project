          "description":"The hand rankings in Omaha poker are the same as the rankings in other kinds of poker, like Texas Hold\u2019em. To play Omaha poker, you\u2019ll need to know which poker hands are better than others so you can bet accordingly. The hand rankings in order from best to worst are:\nRoyal flush: 10, jack, queen, king, and ace in the same suit. Straight flush: any straight in the same suit, like 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of hearts. Four of a kind: 4 cards of the same rank. Full house: 3 cards of the same rank plus 2 cards of the same rank. Flush: any 5 cards that are the same suit. Straight: 5 cards that are consecutive in rank, like 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Three of a kind: 3 cards of the same rank. Two pair: 2 cards of the same rank plus 2 different cards of the same rank. One pair: 2 cards of the same rank. High card: can be any card, but the higher the better (ace is the highest)."

          "description":"At the end of each round, the player with the best 5-card hand wins. In Omaha poker, you get to make your own hand using the cards that you\u2019re dealt as well as the community cards that are dealt face up on the table, which are available to all players. At the end of each round, you want to choose the cards in your hand and on the table that will give you the best hand ranking. If you\u2019re playing Omaha Hi Lo, there are 2 winners at the end of each round: the player with the highest hand, and the player with the lowest hand. In that case, instead of trying to get the best 5-card hand, you could try to get the lowest.Exception: If all of the players except for one fold before a round is finished, the last player remaining automatically wins the pot, regardless of the hand they have."

          "description":"In Omaha poker, each player is dealt 4 cards face down (these cards are called your \u201chole cards\u201d). Then, as the game progresses, 5 community cards are played face up on the table. When you make your best hand at the end of each round, you must use 2 of your hole cards and 3 of the community cards. For example, if you were dealt 4 kings face down, you would only be able to use 2 of them to make your best hand. Alternatively, if there were 4 kings face up on the table, you\u2019d only be able to use 3 of them to make your best hand."

When you\u2019re playing Omaha poker at home, the player with the dealer button is responsible for dealing out the cards at the beginning of each round. If you\u2019re playing at a casino, the dealer doesn\u2019t change (it\u2019s always the casino employee working the table), but the button still gets passed around and is used to indicate who goes first."

The player immediately to the left of the dealer button plays the small blind, and the player to their left plays the big blind. If you\u2019re playing at a casino, the value of the small and big blinds is usually predetermined. If you\u2019re playing at home, you can agree with the other players what you want the blinds to be, like $1.00 for the small blind and $2.00 for the big blind. Just keep in mind that the minimum bet is always equal to the big blind. The small blind is usually half the value of the big blind. If it\u2019s your turn to post a blind, place it on the table where you\u2019d normally place your bet."

The dealer should deal 1 card to a player at a time, dealing each player a second card on their second time around the circle, and so on, until every player has 4 cards.

Therefore, if the first player wants to stay in, they\u2019d need to bet at least what the big blind is worth. For example, if the big blind is $2.00, the first player could call by betting $2.00 or raise by betting more than that. If you\u2019re playing Pot-Limit Omaha, the maximum bet is equal to the size of the pot. For example, if there\u2019s $5.00 in the pot (including the blinds), the most you could bet would be $5.00."

Then, as the game progresses, 5 community cards are played face up on the table. When you make your best hand at the end of each round, you must use 2 of your hole cards and 3 of the community cards.
