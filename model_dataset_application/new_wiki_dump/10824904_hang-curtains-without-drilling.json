          "description":"Adhesive hooks come in different weight capacities, and you'll want to make sure the hooks you get are strong enough to hold up your curtains and curtain rod so they don't fall. Generally, adhesive hooks that can hold up to 16 pounds (7.3 kg) should work. You'll need 2 adhesive hooks per pair of curtains you want to hang up. You can find adhesive hooks online or at your local hardware store. Since you'll be using 2 adhesive hooks, each hook only needs to hold half of the weight of your curtains. For example, if your curtains and curtain rod weigh 32 pounds (15 kg) in total, you would need 2 adhesive hooks that can hold up to 16 pounds (7.3 kg) each. Many adhesive hook brands have stylized versions, made with steel or wood rather than plastic. Opt for these varieties if the aesthetic of your curtains is important to you."

Cut a right angle out of a piece of cardboard. Draw a square at least 2 in (5.1 cm) wide in the corner of the piece of cardboard. Then, cut it out with scissors to create a right angle. You'll use the piece of cardboard with the right angle in the corner to mark where you want to hang up your adhesive hooks so they're level with each other. Align the cardboard with the window corner and mark the bottom of a hook on it. The corner of the window should be aligned with the right angle you cut out of the cardboard.
