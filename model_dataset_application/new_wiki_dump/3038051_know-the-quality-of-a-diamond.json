Of course biased appraisers will write whatever boutique owner needs, so certificates should be issued by a respectable authority.

Place a stone on a paper with a text. If you see only a black spot, this is diamond. In case you see some lines and shapes, this is obviously a fake. Placing a real diamond on a dot on a sheet of paper will result in a black spot visible through it. Fake will show circle instead."
