          "description":"To make baking soda crystals, you start by making a water solution that\u2019s saturated with baking soda. The baking soda will dissolve better in warm water. Measure 2 cups (470 ml) of water into a kettle. Turn on the kettle to boil the water. Be very careful when using appliances and electronics. Ask a parent, guardian, or adult to help you."

          "description":"When the kettle boils, carefully pour the water into a large heat-proof bowl, glass, or jar. Be very careful not to spill the water, as it\u2019s very hot and can burn your skin. You may want to ask an adult to pour the water for you."

          "headline":"Add the baking soda.",
          "description":"Sprinkle half the baking soda into the jar with the hot water. Stir the mixture to dissolve the baking soda in the water. Then, add the remaining baking soda 1 teaspoon (5 g) at a time, stirring each time to dissolve the baking soda. Continue adding baking soda until no more will dissolve in the water and a thin layer of powder forms on the bottom of the jar. You may need to add slightly more or less baking soda than the \u00bc cup (55 g) to completely saturate the water."

          "description":"When the water won\u2019t absorb any more baking soda, set it aside to cool for about 20 minutes. Once the solution has cooled, divide it equally between two small jars or glasses. Leave the last bit of solution in the original jar, and throw out the undissolved baking soda that\u2019s settled on the bottom."

Place the jars on the table or counter about 6 inches (15 cm) apart from each other. Place a plate between the jars to catch any water that may drip. The crystals will need several days to grow, and you don\u2019t want to move them once they start growing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to find a place now where you can set up the experiment."

You can make both jars the same color, or you can color each solution a different color. If you make each jar a different color, half your crystals will be one color, and the other half will be another color."

Use scissors to cut a foot-long (30-cm) length of string. Always be very careful when using scissors, and make sure you have adult supervision when cutting or using sharp tools."

Baking soda crystals need a medium to form on, and string is great for this. Any type of fabric string will work, like string, twine, or yarn. Use scissors to cut a foot-long (30-cm) length of string. Always be very careful when using scissors, and make sure you have adult supervision when cutting or using sharp tools. Tie weights to the string. To keep the strings weighted in the baking soda solution, you can tie weights to each end of the string. Good weights include beads and paper clips. Run each end of the string through the hole in a bead or end of a paper clip, and tie a small knot in the string to secure it to the weight. Place one end of the string in each jar of water. Take one end of the string and gently drop the weight into one of the jars. Pick up the other end of the string and drop the weighted end into the other jar. The string running between the two jars should be loose and hanging down slightly, like a smile. Watching the Crystals Form Leave the jars alone for several days. The baking soda crystals will form as the solution saturates the string and the water evaporates. When the water does evaporate, it will leave behind the baking soda crystals. You can check on the experiment whenever you like, but don\u2019t stir the water or touch the string. The crystals will need about five to seven days to fully form.

You can document the experiment by:\nTaking notes about the length and thickness of the crystals\nNoting the water level in the jars\nMaking drawings of the experiment\nTaking pictures of the project Remove the string and dry the crystals. When crystals have formed on the entire length of the string after about five days, you can remove the string of crystals. Use two hands to grab the string where it attaches to the jars. Carefully pull the string of crystals from the jars and lay it down on a clean plate. Leave the string to dry for several hours. Getting Creative with Crystals Create stalactites and stalagmites. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits that often form inside of caves. You can watch how these formations are made by adding extra water to the string when you're creating your crystals:\nEach day, remove a spoonful of baking soda solution from one of the jars\nDrizzle a few drops of the solution on the center of the string to saturate it\nAs the water drips onto the plate below and evaporates, baking soda crystal deposits will form that dangle from the center of the string (stalactites) and grow up from the plate below (stalagmites). Grow them in eggs. Place a few drops of your colored baking soda solution into a clean egg shell half. Swirl the water around to coat the inside of the shell. Place the egg on a plate and set it aside for a day or two to allow the water to evaporate. Add a few more drops of water every day. As the water evaporates, the crystals will form inside the egg shell. Make different crystal types. You can also make other types of crystals using the same method as with baking soda crystals. Other crystal types you can make include sugar, salt, and Epsom salt crystals. To make these types of crystals:\nDissolve \u2154 cup of sugar, salt, or Epsom salts in a glass of hot water\nDivide the solution between two clean jars\nCut a piece of string to a length of 1 foot (0.30 m) (30 cm)\nPlace each end of the string in one of the jars\nLeave the experiment for several days so the crystals can form",
