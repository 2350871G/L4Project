      "description":"Do you like to play Water and Fire Pok\u00e9mon, or Psychic and Fighting? Most people only have two different types of Pok\u00e9mon in their deck. Sometimes certain decks may effectively use more than two, and sometimes decks use only one. Try to make your types complement each other if possible \u2014 for example, Water and Electricity are good companions, as are Fire and Grass. Take into account the weaknesses of your types, too. If your Psychic-types have weakness to dark, play Fighting types (because most Dark Pok\u00e9mon have Fighting weakness) to counter Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon. Remember that you can use Pok\u00e9mon with colorless attack cost in any kind of deck to bulk it up and fill in gaps. They are versatile and often have many helpful effects. Be aware, though, that no Pok\u00e9mon has weaknesses to colorless type Pok\u00e9mon."

      "description":"In the Pok\u00e9mon TCG, you can win in one of three ways: Collect your opponent's six prize cards, make your opponent run out of Pok\u00e9mon on the field, or make your opponent run out of cards to draw at the beginning of his/her turn. Ask yourself:\nWhich condition will your deck focus on to win the game? How will it best achieve that? What are the ways that your opponent might counter your strategy? Which cards can you use to minimize your weaknesses and maximize your strengths?"

      "headline":"Remember to keep good balance as you choose.",
      "description":"Many decks stick with roughly 20 Pok\u00e9mon, 25 trainers, and around 15 energies for a good mix, although it often depends on the type of deck you're playing. You may want to put in more energies than this, because shuffles can yield uneven hands with Pok\u00e9mon to Energy ratios. For example, a Blastoise/Keldeo-EX Deck from the 2012 City Championships sported 14 Pok\u00e9mon, 32 trainers, and 14 energy. It all depends on what you're trying to do."

      "headline":"Think about the game as a three-role play.",
      "description":"First of all, you need to run multiple copies of your main attacker, and you'll need more of the Basic Pok\u00e9mon than of the Stage 2, fully evolved ones, to be sure that you have an Active Pok\u00e9mon and plenty for your bench. Basic Pok\u00e9mon can be knocked out quickly, so be sure you have some stage 1 or 2 cards up your sleeve. Evolve quickly to give your game some substance after the initial wave of weaker Pok\u00e9mon. Add \"Back-up\" - multiples of the evolution chain - so that you will still be able to get your stage 1 & 2 Pok\u00e9mon out. If you just do 1 of each then when the pre-evolution is knocked out you won't be able to play your strongest Pok\u00e9mon cards. Plan from start to finish. Most decks have a 'start' card like Cleffa or Pichu. cards like these can help you set-up. Have one or two really big 1-hit K.O.ers you can draw for late in play."

      "headline":"Balance your cards.",
      "description":"It's good to use cards that help each other. It needs to be a good deck! Strategy is important! Look for synergies in cards. For example, Hydreigon and Darkrai-EX are a great at moving around Pok\u00e9mon and energies freely. Look for other great combination to use for your advantage."

      "headline":"Choose trainers that best support your Pok\u00e9mon.",
      "description":"You will need about 5-8 trainers that help you draw cards; if you can't get the cards you need, you can't win. Remember that you can put up to 4 of any given card in your deck. If your deck relies heavily on a card, you should boost your chances of drawing it by putting several copies of the card in your deck. You should have around 5 or so cards to support and boost up your Pok\u00e9mon. Any remaining space can be used to combat against frequently used cards or weaknesses, or to refresh your hand/bench."

      "description":"Remember, to begin play, you must draw at least one basic Pok\u00e9mon, so be sure you have plenty of Basics to insure that you get a good opening draw. While you are testing, see if any adjustments to the Energy count can be made, as it can be tricky to estimate how many you will need in any given deck."

    {
      "headline":"Include plenty of trainer and supporter cards.",
      "description":"The best decks tend to have more trainer/supporter cards than any other kind of card. Focus on trainers/supporters that help you draw the cards you will need. Also look for trainers/supporters that jive with your deck's strategy."

      "headline":"Don't stock too many evolutions.",
      "description":"Evolution takes precious time in battle. You should use evolution cards if they are vital to your strategy and if you have trainers to help you evolve quickly. The longer it takes to evolve your Pok\u00e9mon, the more time your opponent has to attack and set up. Example: Charizard GX has an attack with a staggering 300 damage. However, it is quite a bad card. You have to evolve it twice and attach five energies before Charizard GX can use his main attack (then discards 3 attached energy)."
