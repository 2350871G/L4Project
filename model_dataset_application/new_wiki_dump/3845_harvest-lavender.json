Lavender should be cut when the flower have just opened in spring. This is the time during which they're most fragrant and beautiful. Monitor the lavender in the early spring so you can catch it right when the flowers open. If you cut lavender in the spring, the plant may have time to produce more flowers for a second harvest."

          "description":"If you examine the lavender bush, you'll see it's rooted to the ground with tough, woody growth, above which grow the green stalks - green growth. Cutting into the woody growth can hurt the plant. Give it plenty of room by cutting about two inches above the end of the woody growth. The best cutting tool for lavender is called a harvesting knife. It's curved like a scythe and has a serrated edge. If you don't have one on hand, a hand pruner will also work fine. When using a harvesting knife, hook it around the bunched lavender and pull the knife toward you, cutting off the lavender stalks. Continue cutting the lavender until all the stalks have been cut, and the bush that remains is shaped in a neat-looking mound. Cut after the dew has dried but before the heat of the sun draws out too much of the essential oils (you will want those intact to evoke the scent in your home)."

In general, lavender will act like any other flowering plant, when they are de-flowered early enough, at the base of the flower, a new flower grows, giving you more than one harvest per year. Blooms should be ready for reharvest in 2 weeks to a month; when re-flowering slows (to approximately 1 month), do one final harvest."
