  "text":" Knitting the Bobble Increase (bbl inc) Knit into the first stitch but do not drop the stitch from left needle. Yarn over once then insert the right needle into that same original stitch and knit 1 still keeping the stitch on the left needle. Yarn over and knit into it again letting it drop from the left needle. Look and count and note that you will now have 5 stitches created into the original one.  Stop knitting any further and  turn your work and purl across those 5 newly created stitches.  Turn your work back and knit across the same 5 stitches and continue the row. You will then purl across the entire row like usual. Knitting the Bobble Decrease (bbl dec) Watch to see that when you come to the first of those 5 knit bobble stitches you will work the bobble decrease. Slip the first 2 stitches, one at a time knitwise. Next, knit the last 3 stitches together. This is done the same way as k2tog, just with 3 stitches. Pass each slipped stitch over the k3tog stitch, the same way you do when binding off.  Poke the bobble forward with your finger and make sure to pull the next stitch tight. Remember this stitch is in Reverse Stockinette so the bobble faces the purl side of the fabric.
