          "description":"Hand-picking the beetles off of your plants and drowning them in a bucket of soapy water can help to reduce their numbers. Fill a large bucket with 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of dish soap. Then, pull the beetles off of your plants and place them into the bucket of soapy water. If you come across a plant with several beetles on it, then you can also shake them directly into your bucket.Tip: You could also capture and release the beetles outside of your garden if you prefer not to kill them. However, they might come right back into your yard. Drowning the beetles ensures that they will not come back."

          "description":"Japanese beetles are drawn to the scent of geraniums. You might be able to deter them from chowing down on other plants in your garden by planting geraniums in another area of your yard. Check the geraniums once or twice per day for Japanese beetles and hand pick them off. Drown them in a bucket of soapy water to reduce their numbers. You might also notice Japanese beetles on the ground near geraniums. The scent of geraniums makes Japanese beetles dizzy and they might fall off of the plants as a result."

          "headline":"Use crop covers if you want to protect plants that beetles favor.",
          "description":"A simple way to keep beetles off of your plants is to cover them with mesh crop covers. These will ensure that your plants still get enough sunlight and water, but it will prevent beetles from landing on them. Drape a crop cover over the plants that you want to protect from Japanese beetles, such as roses, beans, grapes, or any other plants they have been targeting. Keep in mind that crop covers will also keep important insects, such as bees, away from your plants. If your plants need to be pollinated, such as flowers, then remove the crop cover for a few hours each day."

Look for a product with the main active ingredient \u201cazadirachtin\u201d and apply it according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Since adult beetles ingest neem oil and pass it onto their eggs, it may help to reduce the population of Japanese beetles in your garden. Make sure that you do not use neem oil if you live near a lake or stream since it can be harmful to fish."

Choose an insecticide that targets Japanese beetles and spray the affected plants in your garden. Make sure to follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use. Apply the insecticide early in the morning when the beetles are most active."

However, the traps use scent to attract Japanese beetles, which means that they will be drawn to your yard and you may end up with an even bigger problem. In the process of getting to the trap, they are likely to find plants to chew on. If you decide to use a Japanese beetle trap, place it far away\u2014preferably 0.25 mi (0.40 km) or more\u2014away from the plants you\u2019re trying to protect."
