However, solid flooring is also prone to expansion and contraction, which can change its appearance over time."

          "description":"Engineered flooring consists of multiple layers, only the top one being solid wood. The way engineered flooring is made prevents it from expanding and contracting, which means it always stays the same. However, it usually comes with a pretty thin layer of solid wood, which doesn't leave enough room for future refinishing. If price is a big concern, engineered flooring is a better option. Not only is it cheaper, it can also be installed directly onto concrete floors, which can significantly reduce your costs."

Also, you don't need to rely on your contractor's skills when it comes to finishing touches. Once the flooring is delivered, it only needs to be installed."

However, choosing for the flooring to be finished on site allows you to make adjustments during the entire installation process. When it comes to price, unfinished flooring is less affordable, since you need to pay a contractor to first install your flooring and then do the finishing touches as well."

Quarter-sawn wood also has straight lines, but they\u2019re much more eye-catching, which makes for excellent flooring choice for modern and rustic styles. Distressing is a finishing technique you can use to make the pattern on your flooring more prominent.
