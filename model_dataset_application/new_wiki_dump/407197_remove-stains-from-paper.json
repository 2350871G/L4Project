This article explains how to take care of the three most common stains:\n\nWater-based stains: This group is probably the most likely. It includes most types of beverages, including coffee, tea, and soda. These liquids act as a sort of dye, leaving pigment behind as a stain once dried. Oil or grease stains: As their name suggests, these are stains caused by oils, such as those used in cooking. These stains are generally more difficult to remove than water based stains, as grease leaves behind oily clear spots in paper. Blood stains: Whether from a paper cut or a nose bleed, blood can often find its way onto a book. While blood is technically water based, special consideration during cleanup must be made to prevent a permanent yellow stain."

Oil stains generally don't set in the same way that water-based stains do, but they can still spread quickly. Wash your hands before moving to the next step to make sure they are free of oil.

Again, make sure the paper towel is around one inch wider than the stain on all sides. This is especially important to avoid getting oil on the object in the next step. Put a heavy book on top of the second paper towel. The best books to use are hardcover textbooks and dictionaries. Any flat, heavy object may be used instead of a book. If the stain was inside of a book, close the book with the paper towels inside and place a second book on top. Remove the book after a few days. The stain may be completely removed at this point. If the stain is still visible, try replacing the paper towels and put the book back on the paper for another night. If any oil still remains, proceed to the next step.
