Add the chopped tomato, stir in, season with salt and pepper and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until you achieve a nice thick consistency. If you are going to serve the potatoes soon then you will need to pre-heat the oil. So pour in the litre of vegetable oil into a large pan and bring to high heat."

You will need to cook the potatoes in 3 batches, so place the first batch using your slotted spoon into the hot oil. And allow to fry for roughly 3 minutes. When the first batch is ready, remove them using your slotted spoon and place them onto a tray with some kitchen roll to drain. Now, place the second batch of potatoes into the hot oil and when ready, remove with your slotted spoon and transfer to the tray to drain. Then place the final batch into the hot oil and fry. Remove when ready and once more drain on the tray."
