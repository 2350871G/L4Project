          "description":"That said, even cell-phone cameras pushing the bar in terms of photo quality, and an iPhone 6 or newer model Galaxy has enough power to work in a pinch. As a good benchmark, the camera should be no less than 8 megapixels. It is always best to have a second person \"on-set\" to help out. Ask your friends with nice cameras if they'll be willing to lend it to you, or shoot the photos while you focus on posing. If you can't get someone to help you, make sure you have a timer or remote shutter on your camera. There are apps for most phones that cover this if you need."

          "headline":"Wear simple, neutral clothes and/or makeup.",
          "description":"Headshots are a bit like blank canvasses, letting casting directors, photographers, or advertisers to image you in their shots and sets. Don't try to impress them with a wild look or striking outfit -- you just want your naturally beautiful self. That said, you should remember to show off your best assets. If you've got killer arms -- make sure you wear something that shows them! Try out:\n\nMen: A simple, form-fitting v-neck (crisp and clean) will work, but a button-down is usually your best bet. Aim for solid colors or basic, clean patterns. Women: A nice cardigan or even a form-fitting, clean v-neck might work, as will simple dresses and tops. Remember that a proper fit is the most important thing. Don't match your skin tone -- look for something that makes you pop. Black people should stay away, generally, from dark colors, while pale people should avoid white. Freckled or rosy-complexioned people might want to avoid reds and oranges."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a simple, solid background.",
          "description":"Striped backgrounds are a very bad example, and so are bright colors. Solid colors won't distract your viewers, allowing them to focus on you. Step a few feet away from the background so that it blurs behind you. This helps you really pop off the page or screen. Light or cream colored background, as well as black or navy, are good colors to shoot for. The most complicated you want to get might be an outdoor wall, like some nice red brick or wood paneling on the side of the house. This is about as complicated a background as you should go, however."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Ensure you are evenly lit, taking extra attention to avoid shadows on your face.",
          "description":"Never have your strongest light source behind you. You want lights that lead to a nice, even glow, with very few shadows and soft angles. A big place to focus is underneath the eyes -- since most lights are overhead, this area shades in and makes you seem tired. Use a light bounce, lamp, or even a large flashlight to add a little light from below the face. Cloudy, overcast days provide gorgeous, even lighting in most circumstances. Avoid the hours around noon. The hour right before sunset and the hour right after sunrise are called \"golden hours.\" If you have plenty of access to light, these shots often look incredible. Use clamp lights or lamps when shooting indoors. You don't need professional lights, but you may need to take a lamp or two from other rooms to create enough light."

Getting the upper halves of your shoulders provides nice framing and puts everything in perspective -- floating heads come off as a little unsettling. If your friend is taking photos, check them every so often to make sure they're capturing the right things."

          "headline":"Take both serious and smiling shots, taking far more than you think you need.",
          "description":"Digital cameras have made head-shots far more affordable and easy for the budding thespian. There is rarely a limit on the number of photos you can take, but you'll need to variety to choose from. This is the one photo that is supposed to represent you, and you'll want a large collection of subtly different shots to choose from. Hold each pose for at least 2-3 photos. That way, if you happen to blink in one, you'll always have a few extras. If a pose doesn't feel comfortable, or \"like you,\" then skip it. Genuine smiles and emotion will always translate better in the camera."

        {
          "headline":"Ignore the camera as much as possible, even as you look right at it.",
          "description":"For your headshot, you want to look right in the camera. But you also want to act natural, trying your best to act like there is no camera at all. While everyone has a different way of \"warming up\" to the camera, you can try to:\nClose your eyes, take a deep breath, and then open them with your big smile. Often this moment, right when you break out in a smile, is the most natural. Have a trusty, funny friend helping out. If they're yelling out jokes, poses, or ideas, it takes pressure off of you to think of something and perform at the same time. Move through emotions slowly. Don't try and force them. Instead, let your face change slowly. Subtly change your smile (which lip is higher, open or closed lips, etc.) and head angle, tilting it slightly up and down to see what looks best for you."

          "headline":"Think about camera angle to help determine the \"mood\" of the shot.",
          "description":"Where you position the camera will subtly change your look. In all cases, the camera is shooting you almost entirely head-on, as if lined up with your nose. How you carefully deviate from \"dead-center,\" can change the shot. For example:\n\nPutting the camera below your face and pointing up makes you seem bigger, stronger, and more masculine. Putting the camera slightly above your face and angling down makes you seem softer, more tender, and \"quieter.\" It is often more feminine, but guys showing their softer side use it too. Putting the camera to either side gives you a slightly dramatic, theatrical look. Don't overdo it, however -- you should still be able to see at least 95% of your face."

          "headline":"Review the photos periodically to find looks you like or shots you might re-take.",
          "description":"Don't just assume they all look good (or worse, assume they look terrible) without looking. The easiest time to retake photos is right now, so run through them with a trusty friend to see if you have enough strong material. If you're really dedicated, change your outfit and take another set. You'll already be \"warmed up\" to the camera, and everything is set up."

More often than not, you simply can't create enough distance between yourself and your own picture to be a great judge of the shots. Prune away any obviously bad shots (out of focus, blinking, etc. ), then have some friends or family members point out their favorites. Don't ask for advice if you're not going to take it. Even if you think a shot isn't your best, if multiple people pick it out then it clearly resonates in some way."

          "description":"You could spend hours talking about photo editing, but the basics will handle 95% of your shots. Brightness and Contrast are the most important features. Use it to create a nice range of blacks, whites, and grays. Lower the brightness to remove any bright white spots, then up the contrast so that any black pixels in the image are deep and dark. Avoid any bright \"pure white\" patches. Lowering the brightness usually takes care of this, but you could also start to experiment with Luma Curves. To do so, pull the far right slider to the left to lower the total white output."

          "description":"Sharpness, when added subtly, can take great pictures and make them even stronger. Note, however, that too much sharpness makes an image grainy and unattractive. Each photo editor has different settings, but even adding 4-5% sharpness will separate amateur editors from pros."

          "description":"Saturation is a measure of the color intensity, so higher saturation means more vibrant colors. This is a nice subtle way to make your skin, eyes, and hair really pop, but you can overdo it. For real Photoshop pros, try upping the Saturation in just the reds and oranges to give yourself a natural looking \"tan glow.\" You can use saturation to help fix some small shooting errors. If, for example, the light makes you look a little sickly, lower the saturation in the greens and up some reds and oranges."
