You may want to design a cork that will match your or your gift recipient's d\u00e9cor so planning the color spool and thread is something to ponder. Determine how many corks you'd like to create. Giving a set of four or six corks as a gift may be a nice display. Or if you are giving multiple gifts, take a count of the number of recipients before heading to the store. Assess your thread needs. Thread comes in a variety of sizes, colors and textures. Examine your current supply and determine if you need to pick up new thread and whether your supply will meet your design needs. Count your current cork supply. Either begin saving wine corks now survey your current collection. You want corks that are completely in tact with no missing pieces or stains. Typically recycled white wine corks work best (red wine corks may be stained). Visit the craft store to pick up embroidery thread/string, wood glue and wooden spools. The thread and spools are the crowning design point so make sure you find thread and spools that are attractive. Find a sharp pair of scissors and double sided clear tape. Create Thread Corks Tape one end of the thread to the lowest side of the wooden spool. Make sure the tape holds well as you will be using it as your anchor as you wind the thread around the spool.
