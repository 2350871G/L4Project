At the end of the level is a block that looks like a space bar (hint, hint) and the bonus. Many times the bonus will be sitting on the underside of a block, and you need to figure out how to get to it, but not this level. Just press space once you have jumped up once, and you will get the bonus. Once the floor beneath you starts to turn different colors, you know you are at the end of the level."

If you can't jump high enough, or you can't see the bonus entirely, then maybe there is another path that leads to the bonus. For example, on Level 2, if you hold down \"right\" from the start of the level, you can get past the long wall to the right of the level, and you'll find the bonus along that path."
