The oatmeal container will represent the main body of the lighthouse, so use other colors to paint windows and a door on it. You could also paint diagonal stripes around the oatmeal container if you wish. Put down newspaper when painting. Paint in a well-ventilated area.

Tape the two ends of the transparency piece together so that it forms a cylinder and apply a thin line of glue along one edge. Center the glued edge over the tuna can and press it down gently. A transparency cylinder is a rolled-up cylinder made of a transparency sheet. The purpose of the transparency cylinder is to lend the lighthouse model a realistic look and provide a base for the model\u2019s roof.

Gently pull the two sides of the cut toward each other so that they overlap slightly, making a shallow cone. Apply a piece of tape to the underside of the cone so that the paper retains this shape, then apply a few dabs of glue to the top edge of the transparency cylinder and set the brown paper cone on it."
