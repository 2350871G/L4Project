If you're showing the ultrasound photos to others, consider putting the pictures in a protective plastic sleeve so that they won't be touched by lots of fingers."

If you\u2019re putting the photos in an album, make sure there\u2019s a blank page opposite the photo. Placing regular paper between each photo will help preserve them."

Photo boxes are perfect for storing ultrasound photos and can be found at craft stores, big box stores, or online. If you're storing the photos in a drawer or closet, make sure they're well-protected. Either put paper underneath and on top of each photo, or wrap them in flat tissue paper."

Buy a pack of self-laminating pages from an office store, big-box store, or online. These are heatless and won\u2019t ruin the photos. To use the self-adhesive laminating sheets, all you have to do is peel off the backing and position your picture in between both sheets. Make sure you go slowly and press out any air bubbles. Start at a corner of the photo when flattening the sheets together to help prevent wrinkles. Use scissors to cut out your photo once it's laminated."

Place the photos in a picture frame with the back securely fastened to help preserve them. You can purchase picture frames designed specifically for ultrasound photos online. These frames don\u2019t protect the pictures any differently from other frames, but they are designed to be the same size as the ultrasound photos and have special wording or illustrations on them."

Just make sure your scrapbook is lignin-free, acid-free, and PVC-free. Lignin is a chemical compound found in wood, and PVC is a type of plastic, both of which eventually break down and release acids. When you\u2019re creating the scrapbook, use photo corner squares to keep the pictures in place and prevent them from being damaged."
