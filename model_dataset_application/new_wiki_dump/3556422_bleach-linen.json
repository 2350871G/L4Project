          "description":"For linens with stains, it is best to set them soaking as quickly as possible when you first notice the stain. Treating the stain quickly will help avoid the stain setting and becoming harder to remove later. Put the linen in a bucket or tub that is completely clean and add water. Allow to soak for at least 2 days, but you can also allow linens to soak longer. It is often recommended to use cold water because hot water can make stains set, but others say hot water is the only way to remove stains. To be safe, stick with a cold water soak. It\u2019s best to agitate the water every so often. You may also want to change the water depending on how bad the stain is. If the water starts to become obviously dirty, change it out for fresh water and continue the soak.

These modern stain removers have made many traditional methods obsolete. Spray a liberal amount on specific spots that need treatment. Allow the stain treatment to soak into the cloth before moving on. It is recommended to never use chlorine bleach, even as a spot treatment, on linens because it can cause yellowing and deteriorate the fabric.

If you're washing white linens, you can pour the bleach directly into the washing machine. However, you'll need to add the bleach to the washing machine twice\u2014once during the first cycle, then again on the second rinse."

          "description":"If you are working with linen that is vintage or delicate, washing by hand is almost always what you want to do. Washing machines can be abrasive because of the rapid violent movement, especially machines with a center agitator. Wash with warm water, a basic mild detergent, and powdered oxygen bleach. Follow the instructions on the bleach product, but in general it is concentrated pretty highly and you shouldn't need too much, only about one filled scoop. Be sure to separate white linens from dark or colored linens to avoid any bleeding of the colors or fading of the white linens. An example of mild detergent would be something recommended for use on baby clothes like Dreft or All Free and Clear. Oxygen bleach is usually made with sodium percarbonate, so you can look for this in the ingredients when buying. Oxi Clean is a pretty standard bleach to use. If you are washing by hand, it is highly recommended that you wear rubber gloves to protect your hands from the chemical reaction of the bleach."

You can leave the linen in the sun for a few hours or up to a week depending on how well the piece is bleaching. Check it every so often to make sure it is not becoming damaged by prolonged exposure. Make sure the linen is damp when you lay it out in the sun. This will help it bleach better. You can either hang it on a clothes line, or if the piece is small enough, you can set it on a table or hang in off of your porch. You may want to consider putting a separate cloth over any wood or other surfaces the linen will touch to keep it clean. Spread the linen out flat and flip it periodically for the best bleach. The length of time you should leave the linen out can vary. Some people find that leaving it out for multiple days or a whole week gives the best results. Others feel that too much sun exposure can damage the fabric. Your best bet is to keep a watchful eye on your piece and make sure it doesn\u2019t seem to become damaged. You could also avoid this by continuing to dampen it each day if you are leaving it out for a while. If you have particularly dark stains, try spraying a mixture of lemon juice and water on the spots before you put it in the sun. This will give those spots a boost to help reduce the stains."
