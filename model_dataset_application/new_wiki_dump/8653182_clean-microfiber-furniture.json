The first step in cleaning your furniture is to remove particles, dirt, and hair using a vacuum. If your furniture has removable cushions, remove these and vacuum on all sides of them, as well as underneath. If you own pets or if your furniture is particularly dirty, you may need to go over it with a vacuum more than once. Use an upholstery attachment to lift out dirt as best you can. If you do not have an upholstery attachment, you can use a dry bristle brush. Perform a spot test. Once you have selected the appropriate cleaning product for your furniture, it is a good idea to do a spot test to ensure that this product will not cause damage or stains. Dab a bit of cleanser onto a sponge or washcloth, and apply it to an inconspicuous location. Wait 15-20 minutes for this area to dry. If there is no stain or spot, you can go ahead and use this product. Place liquid cleanser in a spray bottle. Whether you will be using a solvent-based solution--like rubbing alcohol--or a water-based one--like dish soap and water--place this cleanser into a bottle with a spray top. Then, mist one area of your furniture piece. Scrub. Select a sponge that is either light-colored or roughly the same color as your microfiber furniture to reduce color transfer when scrubbing. Using a vigorous motion, scrub the furniture where it has been misted. You should be able to see dirt and stains coming off onto the sponge. When you finish with one area, mist and repeat someplace else. Finishing the Process Blow-dry any wet spots. If any wet spots remain after scrubbing your sofa, use a blow dryer to eliminate them. This will reduce any chance of stains on your furniture. Use the blow dryer on its lowest, coolest setting. Hold the blow dryer 6\u201d away from the fabric. Fluff your furniture. In order for microfiber furniture to look its best, it needs to be \u201cfluffed\u201d after cleansing. Otherwise, this fabric can become dull and stiff. After your furniture is clean and dry, grab a dry bristle brush. Rub the fabric in a circular motion all over the furniture. You should be able to watch the fabric become fluffier and more attractive as you go! Spray \u201cfabric protector\u201d on your furniture. Once your sofa, chair, or ottoman is clean and dry, use a spray-on fabric protector to help keep it that way! These products are available at most grocery and home improvement stores.
