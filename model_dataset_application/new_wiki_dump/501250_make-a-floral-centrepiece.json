Ensure that there are no big gaps. Continue until all ten blooms are in and arrange them in a sweeping fashion. The effect will be a beautiful  centerpiece: vine-like curves with flowers interwoven. You do not have to use a fish bowl to make the centerpiece. A simple vase will do. Just put the flowers into the vase, and start arranging them in different ways until you get the look that you want."
