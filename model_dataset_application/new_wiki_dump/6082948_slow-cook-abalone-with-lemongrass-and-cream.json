  "text":" Cooking Abalone Thaw and rinse the abalone with cold water.  Heat olive oil and butter in the large pan over medium heat.  Add the garlic, ginger, lemongrass, spring onions and cook for two minutes.  Lower the heat before adding the abalone meat. When putting the meat on the pan make ensure the sides are down. Place the lid on and continue to cook on low heat for 20 minutes. The abalone will release juices into the pan. Take the abalone off the heat until the juices reduce. Once the abalone is cooked remove it from the pan. Save the stock mixture for the sauce. Remove the abalone meat and gut gently from the shell.  Wash the shells and set aside for later.  Remove the gonad and the mouth from the meat. The gonad is the green and white portion of the gut. Discard the mouth and put aside the guts for the sauce. Making Sauce Combine the abalone guts and the stock in a pan to make the sauce. Stir to combine over medium heat. Add white wine and use a wooden spoon to break up the abalone guts.  Simmer and reduce the sauce by half, then add the cream. Continue stirring the sauce. Take the sauce off the heat when it reaches a smooth and creamy consistency.  Plating Up Strain sauce through a fine sieve.  Evenly slice the cooked abalone meat.  Arrange the meat neatly in the shells.  Pour sauce over the abalone and serve with freshly cracked pepper. ",
