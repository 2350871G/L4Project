If it isn't you can straighten it by running it between your fingers. Try using a piece of soft leather to protect your skin. Make a 90 degree bend about 2.5\u201d from the end of the wire. Use the round nose pliers to secure the wire while bending one end of the wire over the pliers. (Make this bend as sharp as you can). Place the bent wire halfway down the round nose pliers, about half an inch from the tip of the pliers themselves. The back of the wire should be flush with the pliers. Hold the round nose pliers in your dominant hand, with the bend of the wire you created pointing towards you from between the pliers. The tail will be hanging down. Bend the end of the short wire back, around the top of the round nose pliers, using the thumb of your non-dominant hand. Bend the wire most of the way around the pliers, but not completely. It should not touch the other end of the wire. Remove the round nose pliers from the wire. You now should see a loop, resembling a half circle with two straightened ends. Reinsert the round nose pliers back into the loop so that bottom tip of the pliers is within the loop, instead of the top. Be sure the wire loop you have created is tight against the pliers. Push the top of wire over the round nose pliers to meet the portion of the wire underneath the pliers and ends at a 90 degree angle to the long tail. This step allows you to complete the loop.

Continue to hold the bent nose pliers in your hand while wrapping the end of the wire around the stem for two more turns using your hand. You should now have a completed loop, with three circles around the stem, created from the end of the wire. Now that you have completed your wire wrap, cut the excess wire using the wire cutters.
