Completing Your Celtic Square Knot Weave the leading end through the right loop of the pretzel. Go over the rope that makes the outside of the right pretzel loop, then go straight through the center of the loop, and finally go under the rope at the top left portion of the right pretzel loop. The leading end should be in the middle of the V-shaped gap at the top of the pretzel shape\u2014that is, the gap between the right and left loops.
