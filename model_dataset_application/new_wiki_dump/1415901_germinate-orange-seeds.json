Many seeds have a better chance of sprouting if they're soaked first, because soaking softens the seed coating and kickstarts the germination. When the seeds have soaked for 24 hours, drain the water and place the seeds on a clean towel. Don\u2019t soak the seeds for longer than this, as they may become waterlogged and not sprout."

If planting directly into the ground, then dig a small hole and place the seed in the ground. If planting in a pot, fill the bottom with a thin layer of pebbles to increase drainage, and fill the pot the rest of the way with potting soil.

Alternatively, if you live in an area that stays relatively warm all year round, you can transplant the tree to a sunny location outside. Orange trees will typically not survive if they're exposed to temperatures below 25 F (-4 C), so they can't be permanently transplanted outside in cooler areas.
