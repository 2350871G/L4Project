Pay special attention to the entrance\u2019s corners. If the shed is large enough, and if you\u2019re brave enough, get inside, close the door, and see if any light is visible where the door meets its casing."

          "description":"If your shed has windows, apply a silicone or acrylic latex caulk to seal any gaps in the casing. Check the roof\u2019s soffits and fascia boards, and use caulk to seal any cracks you find. Inspect the shed\u2019s structure regularly to make sure no gaps or cracks have formed, and reapply caulk when needed."

          "headline":"Seal any vents and utility holes.",
          "description":"Some sheds feature vents and other openings, such as entry points for utility wires. Use the finest wire mesh you can find to seal vents (preferably 1/16 inch or 1.5 millimeter). Plug any utility holes with caulk, expandable foam, or steel wool. Wear gloves when cutting and installing wire mesh, since the edges are razor sharp."

Go for flat glue traps without raised perimeter edges, as these are the best for catching spiders. Check the glue traps regularly, and replace them when they\u2019re covered with critters. Get help from a brave friend or family member if necessary! You can find glue traps at your local grocery or hardware store."

While pesticide barriers don\u2019t always work against spiders in the long-term, they do keep out flies, ants, and other creepy crawlies that provide food for spiders. Bug bombs and foggers aren\u2019t very effective in deterring spiders, but they could be useful if you have a fly or ant problem and need to get rid of spider food sources.

While hard to find in most locations, Osage oranges contain a chemical that might deter spiders and insects. If you can find one, cut it in half and leave the halves in the shed. You could even paint your shed blue, which is said to repel spiders. Just keep in mind there\u2019s no scientific evidence that supports natural repellents like the color blue, vinegar, and Osage oranges."

Spider control is usually part of the basic services provided by most professional exterminators. A first-time professional application typically costs around $100 (US). Taking care of an infestation of dangerous spiders could cost up to several hundred dollars."
