          "description":"For optimal viewing of Mars, track its orbit with a sky map or chart to keep track of its distance from Earth. A sky map is a map of the night sky that indicates the location of planets, stars, constellations, and other celestial bodies. Interactive versions are available online (for example, visit http://www.sky-map.org/), or you can download an app for your smartphone. Make sure to get the right map for your current location, and for the current date."

          "description":"Mars\u2019 closest approach to Earth occurs every 26 months, but it appears the brightest eight days earlier, on the date of opposition. This date marks the point in the planet\u2019s orbit when it rises in the east as the sun sets, which makes it visible in our sky overnight. While there are many other opportunities to view Mars in the night sky, this biennial event should not be missed if you are truly interested in observing the planet."

Cloudy skies, and certainly precipitation, will impede your viewing. Consult a local weather report, or a clear sky chart online to predict weather conditions for the near future."

As a general rule, you should be focused on finding a telescope with good optics and a sturdy mount that moves smoothly. With this in mind, read reviews online and look for beginner telescopes that have these features and have good ratings."

          "headline":"Choose from 3 types of telescopes.",
          "description":"While any telescope can facilitate your observation of Mars, there are three kinds of telescopes on the market to choose from. These three types use different optics to enhance distant objects and make them look larger to the eye. The options are:\nRefractors, where you have a lens at the front of the tube; these are popular and low-maintenance, but can be expensive depending on the model. Reflectors, which gather light with a mirror at the back of the tube; these are less expensive but require more adjustment when used. Compound telescopes, which use a combination of lenses and mirrors."

          "headline":"Look for a telescope with a higher aperture.",
          "description":"As a general rule, the bigger the telescope, the better. Look for telescopes with a higher aperture, which refers to the diameter of its light-gathering lens or mirror. Opt for a telescope with an aperture of 4 inches (10.2 cm) or more, which can pick up greater detail on a planet or other celestial body."

          "headline":"Purchase color filters.",
          "description":"If you opt to buy them, color filters can add a lot to your experience of viewing Mars. These filters screw onto the tip of your telescope and work by controlling the type and quantity of light that your eyes receive by either reflecting or transmitting it. Some specific filters that might enhance your Mars observation are:\nOrange (#21): increases contrast and penetrates clouds and haze\nRed (#25, #29): enhances surface details\nYellow (#12, #15): brightens desert regions, darkens blue and brown features\nGreen (#57): darkens red and blue features\nBlue (#80A, #38, #38A): shows clouds and darken reddish features"

Leave your telescope outdoors for an hour or two before using it to allow the equipment to adjust to the climate; the shift from indoor to outdoor temperatures could cause the telescope\u2019s optics to fog up, affecting the view. To make your viewing more efficient later, align your finderscope (i.e. the aiming device in your telescope) ahead of time; focus on a distant object and adjust the settings to fix the view.

Some key features that observers look for are:\nMars\u2019 polar ice caps\nthe pale haze that forms over polar regions\nalbedo markings (i.e. variations of light and dark on the surface of the planet, marking an alternation of bedrock and desert sands)\nclouds in the planet's atmosphere"

          "description":"Sketching Mars during your observations is an excellent way of making yourself think about what you are seeing; experienced observers spend years sketching the planet to note any intriguing details on its surface or in its orbit. Be patient in order to capture fine details accurately; draw the foremost features first (e.g. the polar ice caps) and then add finer details (e.g. clouds, haze). Be sure to note the date, time, and filters used (if any) to establish the full context of your observation."

The weeks surrounding Mars\u2019 opposition with the Sun and its closest approach to earth are the best times to view the planet without equipment. Track the dates with a sky map; Mars should be viewable throughout the evening during this time period. Use an app like Sky Map to track where the planet is."

          "description":"If your interest in viewing Mars is keen enough, consider joining a local astrology club to meet others with the same passion. This is a great way to interact with experienced group members who can offer advice about equipment and other important aspects of astronomy. Group meetings may involve learning new techniques and trying new equipment, which will enhance your astronomy skills and make your observations of Mars even better. Your local planetarium may also offer resources for advancing your astronomy skills, including lessons on how to use a telescope and relevant shows about Mars."
