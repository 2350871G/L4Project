Stick to tiny meals throughout the day and avoid sodium, which can cause bloating. Have tiny meals like fruit and yogurt, hard boiled eggs, and small salads."

While you should have a small amount of water to stay hydrated, make sure not to consume too much liquid either. This can fill up your stomach, making it difficult to indulge later on."

Branches and feathers were frequently used in medieval times, so consider using these as well. Sweet smelling flowers were often used in centerpieces, so opt for flowers like lilacs, violets, and sweet peas.
