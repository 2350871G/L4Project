          "description":"The sun will eventually damage any fabric over time, but some fabrics are more durable than others against the sun\u2019s rays. Faux silk, chintzes, brocades, and cotton canvas tend to be the sturdiest and least prone to sun rot\nIf unlined, silks are particularly susceptible to sun rot. Avoid curtains with intricate or bold patterns, as they fade quickly and show sun fade more than solid prints. If you\u2019re buying fabric to have your curtains custom-made, make sure to use decorator fabric specifically. The thread count is typically higher, so they last longer. Some brands of fabric are designed for sunny rooms, so choosing one of these brands is advised."

          "headline":"Maximize natural light with sheer fabrics.",
          "description":"If you enjoy lots of natural lighting, sheer fabrics are the way to go. They\u2019re perfect for small spaces that you want to be sunlit, since sheer materials are thin and take up very little room. Sheers also provide natural ventilation. If privacy is a concern, choose semi-sheers, which offer a subtle amount of privacy without sacrificing the natural lighting. If you have allergies, consider sheer fabrics. They are excellent at preventing pollen from entering open windows. Sheers come in a range of materials, including cotton, silk and synthetics. Cotton is the most cost-effective choice. You can add another curtain in a heavier fabric during the colder months, then remove it and just leave the sheers when the temperature warms up."

        {
          "headline":"Select a heavy fabric when you need a lot of coverage.",
          "description":"When you need very long curtains to cover large spaces, choose a fabric that will hang heavily. Heavy fabrics like velvet, velveteen, suede, corduroy, tapestry, and wool-blends will stay put in front of your windows and shield the most light from the room. If cold winters are an issue, heavy fabrics will help insulate the room and increase the energy efficiency of your heating system. Another option would be using cotton duck curtain lining, which is very heavy and thick. Keep in mind that heavier fabrics have a traditional look, so you may want to avoid these if your room has a modern feel."

They will also decrease the sound of outside noise. Black-out curtains are usually made of very heavy polyester or Thermaweave, which is woven fabric that also provides insulation. Blackout curtains can also help insulate the room and keep hot or cold air from seeping in from outside. These specialty curtains can usually be found at any home furnishing store. They come in a wide range of styles, colors, and patterns. Seek out curtains that are labelled with terms like \u201cblackout,\u201d \u201croom-darkening,\u201d and/or \u201clight-blocking.\u201d"

Don\u2019t forget to take into account any patterns that appear in your wallpaper or on furniture fabric. In most cases, you will want to choose a hue that will tie your curtains in with the color palette of the room. As an alternative, you can create a unique vibe by choosing curtain colors that don\u2019t tie in with the current color scheme. You don\u2019t want the curtains to clash with the d\u00e9cor, but as long as the colors are complementary, they don\u2019t have to exactly match. As an alternative to matching the color, you can match the texture. For instance, choose cotton curtains to match a sofa with a cotton slipcover."

          "description":"Transform a plain room with patterned or printed curtains, which can add color and texture. Choosing patterns that feature contrasting colors to your furniture and walls can create even more energy and make a basic room far more interesting. You can also create height in a low-ceilinged room by choosing patterns featuring vertical stripes. Formal home interiors are best dressed with heavy, printed curtains. These create a dramatic effect. Go with thinner, more delicate printed fabrics for a casual vibe. Adding fun, printed curtains is an easy way to upgrade the d\u00e9cor of a room and helps create a polished feel."

          "description":"Choose curtains that are at least one shade lighter or darker than the interior walls, as this will stop them from blending into the walls completely. To make the curtains stand out, choose colors that contrast and complement the colors of the walls and furnishings. Make a statement with a bold pop of contrasting color or give a neutral room a focal point with a vibrant curtain hue. You can also create contrast by layering curtains. For instance, put a curtain with a bold color or pattern on top of or next to a neutral-colored curtain. Alternatively, you can soften a room by blending with existing colors."

          "description":"If a room already has a lot going on, avoid making it appear busier with patterned curtains. Dress the room down and balance the look with a more subdued fabric. Solid curtain colors will also help balance things out. Don\u2019t be afraid to match patterns in some cases, however. If, for example, stripes are already a subtle theme in the room, you may want to consider striped curtains to match. Pattern mixing can also be effective if you are going for an offbeat vintage vibe."

Go even higher to create a lavish, powerful effect. For rooms with low ceilings, consider floor-to-ceiling drapes, which will create the illusion of more space.

This will create a very classic looking puddle effect. Choose shorter lengths if you have children and/or pets to prevent curtains from getting damaged. If you battle excessive dust in a particular room, go with curtains that don\u2019t reach the floor. Otherwise they will get dirty very quickly."

This will slow down the fading effect that the sun has on bright colors. Unless you plan on changing out your curtains often, use lining to lengthen the shelf life of your drapes."

Airy, modern spaces work best with thin, simple curtains. Formal rooms should be accented with layered panels or thick materials. Think about the current impact of the room and how you want the curtains to tie into that. For example, if the d\u00e9cor in a room is already busy, think about pulling a single background color out of your statement wallpaper design. Then use that as a monochrome curtain theme.
