Go to the path area where you want to place the arrow and use a ruler or tape measure to work out a suitable size for the arrow. Draw the large arrow design on brown paper or similar large paper. Arrow designs are plentiful online, so if you don't want to draw one freehand, print one off to copy or trace over. Cut the arrow shape out of the paper to make the pattern."
