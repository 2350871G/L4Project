          "description":"Before you trace your scallops into your actual garment, it is helpful to practice the design on a piece of paper first. This can help you to find the ideal size for your piece. Start by drawing a straight line on the paper, and then place of the round objects on the line so that only about half or less than half of it is on one side of the line. Trace around the rounded edge to create your first scallop. After you make the first scallop, slide the round object over so that the edge is lined up with the edge of the first scallop you traced onto the paper. Then, draw another scallop in the same way. Continue to create scallops in this way until you are happy with the design. If you are planning to make a template using freezer paper to guide your work, then trace your scalloped design onto the freezer paper.
