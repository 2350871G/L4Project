Plug the red lead into the slot marked with a V on the multimeter, and plug the black lead into the slot marked COM.

Check what the regular voltage of the electronic device is \u2014 it is usually indicated either in the user manual or somewhere on the battery or appliance itself. Set the range to one level above the voltage you plan to measure, so if you are measuring a 12v battery, turn the dial to 20v to get an accurate reading. If you choose a range that is too low for your test, the multimeter will display a \"1\", indicating that you need to choose a higher range. If you don't know the operating voltage you can set the meter on its highest range setting and work your way down until you get an accurate reading."

If you place the leads on the wrong terminals, the multimeter will display a negative version of the correct measurement, so a 20v measurement would read -20v. Avoid doing this to avoid malfunctions in your multimeter. To test the voltage on other electrical components, identify the positive and negative terminals in the manufacturer's guide to attach the probes to the correct place."
