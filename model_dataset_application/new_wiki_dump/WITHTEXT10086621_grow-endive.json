          "description":"Endive plants thrive in full sunlight but they can also tolerate partial shade, especially in warmer climates. They will, however, struggle if planted in a spot with full shade. Choose a spot in your garden free of obstructions that may block out light. In general, \"full sun\" refers to 6-8 hours of sunlight per day, while \"partial shade\" refers to 4-6 hours of sunlight per day."

          "description":"Weeds can harm your endive plants by draining the soil of resources such as moisture and nutrients. Remove weeds by gently tugging them out of the ground when the soil is moist. For stubborn weeds, use a garden trowel to dig out the root systems. Wear gardening gloves to protect your hands while weeding. If the weeds in your garden are too out of control to get rid of by hand, use a herbicide as a last resort to kill their root systems. Use herbicide in moderation to prevent harm to your other plants. Use an herbicide meant for use on food gardens."

Use a shovel or gardening rake to loosen the top 8 inches (20 cm) of the soil. Add about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil amendment material and work it into the soil evenly."

If you need to lower the pH level, add elemental sulfur to the soil. Add elemental sulfur to the soil about 2 months before you plant anything so it has time to take effect. Consider using above-ground beds with potting soil if your garden soil is not suitable. It\u2019s much easier to work with the soil you have rather than adjusting it to fit your needs. Purchase a PH level test kit from a garden center or online to assess your soil."
