  "text":" Cucumber Sauce Preparation Gather your ingredients for the sauce.  Peel the cucumbers, cut them lengthwise into quarters, and then cut into small pieces.  Put the cucumber pieces into a blender and liquefy.  Strain the cucumber juice through a small-screened sieve. You will be using the pulp. Drink, save, or discard the leftover cucumber liquid.  Mix the sour cream, cucumber pulp, garlic powder, and lemon juice together, using more or less garlic powder and/or lemon juice to taste.  Serve the sauce in individual dessert dishes.  Cheese Preparation Take cheese out of packages and let sit until it reaches room temperature. (If the cheese is too cold, then during the time it takes to cook, the outer part of the cheese will melt but the inner part will still be too solid and not melted. And if kept in the oil longer to get the inside melted, then the breading will burn). Beat the eggs and pour onto a plate. Pour Italian breadcrumbs onto another plate. Dip all sides of the cheese into the egg mixture, then into breadcrumbs to bread the cheese.  Set cheese on another plate and let the breading on the cheese dry.  Repeat the breading process. They must be double breaded so the cheese won\u2019t melt through the breading during cooking. Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan on slightly less than medium setting. (Use enough vegetable oil to come halfway up the sides of the cheese during cooking). Also heat up a skillet (such as one used for making tortillas, with shallow side walls). Put cheese into the oil until golden brown.  Turn the cheese over and cook until that side is also golden brown.  Put cheese in the skillet and serve as is, along with the cucumber sauce and baguette bread.  Use a fork to cut a piece of the cheese (while cheese is still in the skillet), put the cheese from the fork onto a slice of bread, and put sauce on the bread also. Enjoy!",
