Then, add several squirts or one tablespoon of your dark paint. Mix with a chopstick or paint stirrer. Add more paint as needed to achieve a dark color.

The advantage of using glaze instead of paint is that glaze takes longer to dry than paint, so you can create the look you want without risk of it drying before you perfect it. You have about 10 to 20 minutes to work on one area. Work the glaze into the crevices and carving.
