Soak the rice in approximately 3 cups (750 ml) of cool water, keeping it completely submerged the entire time. Near the end of the soaking time, use your hands to move the rice around while still submerged. As you do this, the water should become notably cloudy. Pour the contents of the bowl through a fine metal colander. Drain the water and keep the rice in the colander."
