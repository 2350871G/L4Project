Throw out any slimy, mottled or discolored leaves you happen to come across while you\u2019re sorting\u2014these can spoil the whole bunch.

For a more thorough cleaning, let the leaves soak at the bottom of a bowl of water for a minute or two. Swishing the leaves in a mixture of water and apple cider vinegar can also help kill any lingering bacteria. To dry the leaves, shake off the excess water, then sandwich them between layers of folded paper towels."

Stack the leaves on top of one another and slice them into halves or quarters, or simply tear them to the desired size by hand. The exact size of the leaves will depend largely on the recipe you plan to use them in. Young plantains bear small, tender leaves that can be eaten whole. You can also use a mandoline or a pair of herb scissors to cut the leaves into strips for soups, slaws and garnishes."

Heat the leaves for 3-5 minutes, then remove them and plunge them into a bath of cold water to stop the cooking process. After a brief blanching, the plantains should have a perfectly balanced texture. Broadleaf plantain (as well as the leaves of more mature plants) is known to be slightly tougher, and may need to be boiled for an additional minute or two. Avoid overcooking greens. This tends to make them mushy and robs them of both their flavor and nutritional value."

Heat a nonstick skillet with butter or olive oil, add the plantain leaves and toss them with minced garlic, shallots or other aromatics until they just begin to wilt. Season with salt and pepper and dig in. Saut\u00e9d plantain leaves can be cooked up as a simple side dish with minimal time or labor. Fresh greens shrink quite a bit when exposed to heat, so you may need to use more leaves in order to produce a full serving."

When the plantains come out of the oven, they\u2019ll be crisp and paper-thin, making them easier to crumble. Season roasted plantain leaves with sea salt, black pepper and garlic or onion powder and eat them like chips. You can also dehydrate the leaves on their own, then grind them up and use them to make teas or mixes for green smoothies."

Left uncooked, plantains have a slightly sweet, earthy flavor similar to artichokes and mild varieties of mushrooms.

Since they\u2019re from a heartier variety of plant, they even retain more of their satisfying crunch. Offer mini plantain quiches or plantain and artichoke dip for the next get-together you host.

Bake in a deep dish with a couple inches of water, olive oil and lemon juice until most of the moisture has been absorbed.
