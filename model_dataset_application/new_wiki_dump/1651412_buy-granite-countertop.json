      "description":"Before finalizing your selection, perform a few simple tests to ensure the granite is of good quality. Test the granite for porosity by letting several drops of water sit on it for 15 minutes. Wipe the water away with a clean paper towel. If there is any residue left behind, the granite is highly porous and may not be a good choice based on its water absorption level. Test for the granite for acidity resistance by leaving a lemon wedge on its side on the sample overnight. After removing the lemon wedge, if you see that the natural sheen of the granite has been diminished or if patches appear, then this granite style will not wear well for long-term use."
