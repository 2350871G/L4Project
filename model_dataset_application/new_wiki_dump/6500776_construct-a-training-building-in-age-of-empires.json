They will also be the ones building the training buildings, in this case the Barracks. To train a villager, left-click the Town Center to select it. Town Centers are different depending on the Home City you are working with. If you are unsure which building is your Town Center, press the hotkey T on your keyboard to immediately select it. Once the Town Center is selected, a panel will appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen with different buttons for the different functions that your Town Center can perform. The \u201cTrain Villager\u201d button is the very first one on the panel\u2014the one with a picture of a man and a woman. Click the button once to train one villager or multiple times to train many villagers. Once the training is complete, your villager(s) will appear in front of your Town Center.
