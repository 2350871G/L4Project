          "description":"To restore cast iron pans, you can strip off the original seasoning using lye. If you are restoring just one or two pans, it is probably easiest to use an oven cleaner that sprays a lye-based foam, like Easy-Off. Spray the foam all over the pans you\u2019re restoring, seal them inside heavy-duty garbage bags, let them sit for 24 hours, then scrub with steel wool. Depending on your pan, it may take multiple applications and scrubbing sessions to remove all the seasoning."

Lye can be purchased at hardware stores, but be sure the product you purchase is pure lye. To make lye solution, use a formula of 1 pound (0.45 kg) of lye crystals per 5 gallons (19 L) of water. Be very, very careful with the lye\u2014it is capable of causing bad chemical burns. Do not get it on your skin. Use heavy-duty rubber gloves and eye protection, and wear long sleeves and long pants to cover the rest of your skin. Always add lye to water. Never pour water over lye, which causes it to boil up. Lye does not affect plastic, so you can reuse old trash cans or plastic containers for this method. A bucket that holds 5 gallons (19 L) works well for one or two pans, or try a larger size if you have many more cast iron pots to soak."

          "description":"Put on heavy-duty gloves to remove the pans from the lye. Using a mildly abrasive sponge or brush, scrub the surface of the pan to remove the seasoning that's been loosened by the lye. If, after 24 hours, there is still seasoning on the cast iron, put the pans back in the bucket for a few more hours. The seasoning will appear as dark spots on the original gunmetal gray surface of the pan. Lye won\u2019t harm the metal at all, so don\u2019t worry about leaving it in the solution for too long.

Test with a magnet to ensure the object is steel, not aluminum, which won\u2019t work. You can use as many as four pieces of metal, which will speed the process along.
