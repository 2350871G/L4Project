This can be achieved by the use liquid insecticide. You have to spray the soil beneath the foundation with the insecticide. This should be done pre-construction and is a requirement in much of the USA. It is possible to perform a post-construction treatment. To do this requires holes to be drilled through slabs and insecticide to be injected beneath the foundation. There are a wide-range of products available for this, and in most states home owners can legally purchase these products if it's for personal use only. Online vendors have videos that you can watch so you can understand how to do this project effectively before you buy anything. If you are uncertain about how to do this, you should seek advice from a professional rather than risk causing damage."

It is extremely difficult to create a prefect barrier with no gaps under a fully constructed house, and termites may discover these spaces and gain access to the building.

Baiting subterranean termites has become an increasingly popular way to tackle an infestation, and can also contribute to longer term deterrence and protection. Baits are slow-acting insecticides which are consumed and then brought back to the colony where the chemicals spreads out across the wider termite population. Some baits use Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) which are very effective at decreasing and destroying whole colonies. IGRs have low toxicity to humans and pets, but often the most effective ones are only available to professionals."
