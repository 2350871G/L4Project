You need a little bit of fat in your daily diet, and adding walnuts to what\u2019s otherwise a really healthy meal can help you get that daily amount without going overboard. Walnuts pair best with salads that include fruit and cheese. For example, you can throw together some mixed greens, sliced pears (use fresh, not canned, pears for this recipe), dried cherries, and raw or candied walnuts to make a great salad."

In a lot of cases, the mild flavor of the walnuts actually enhances the flavor of the vegetables. For example, you can toss \u00bc cup (2 oz) crushed walnuts with blanched brussel sprouts, saut\u00e9ed shallots, champagne vinegar, and Dijon mustard."

          "description":"Walnuts pair really well with cheese. Adding them to any cheese appetizer is a great way to punch up the flavor. It also adds a different texture to the smoothness of the cheese. For example, you can top brie with roasted walnuts. Crush the roasted nuts into small pieces and serve them over the brie with a few tablespoons of honey and spices. For a more individual cheese dish with walnuts, stuff a date with one tablespoon of goat cheese, then stick a walnut half into the cheese. These are a great option if you\u2019re looking for a way to serve walnuts at a less formal dinner or cocktail party because they\u2019re easier for your guests to handle as they mingle."

          "description":"You can create healthier versions of recipes that call for fats like butter by using walnuts instead. Walnuts are high in fat content, but it\u2019s much healthier fat than what you find in butter, so you don\u2019t have to feel so guilty about those recipes! For example, replacing the butter in pesto with walnuts gives you a creamy, delicious texture and taste with less calories. Blend basil, olive oil, finely chopped walnuts, and garlic cloves in a food processor. Add a bit of Parmesan cheese and blend for five to 10 seconds more. You can also use walnuts to make walnut butter. Walnuts are generally better for you than peanuts (and people are often allergic to peanuts but not walnuts), so this is a great substitution. Blend equal amounts roasted walnuts and raw walnuts in the food processor for about 30 seconds. Add honey and a pinch of salt and blend until smooth."

Walnuts give you all of the flavor but less of the fat that breadcrumbs do. For example, you can make a great walnut coating for fish. Simply crush walnuts very finely and press onto the top of your fish filets before you roast them. You can spice up the coating by adding garlic, salt, and pepper."

          "description":"This one sounds a little crazy, but using walnuts alongside other ingredients like cauliflower can give you the taste and texture of meat while keeping your dish vegetarian. This type of substitution is great if you\u2019re vegetarian or vegan and miss certain flavors or if you\u2019re just trying to save some money at the grocery store. To make a vegetarian meat substitute with walnuts, cook a finely chopped mix of cauliflower, mushrooms, carrots, yellow onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium high heat for about 5 minutes. Add a finely chopped meal of walnuts and sundried tomatoes to the veggies on the stove and cook for 1 minute. 2 cups (16 oz) of this mix will replace 1 pound of meat."

Stir constantly until the nuts are coated and the syrup has evaporated. Be careful not to let the syrup burn. Let them cool on wax paper, pulling them apart as they do so.
