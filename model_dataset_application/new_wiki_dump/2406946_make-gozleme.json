You may not need all the water as flour absorbs at different rates, so add it gradually. Allow the dough to sit for an hour. If you made the yeast free version, its recommended to allow the dough to rest overnight."

Keep giving the dough 90 degree rotation turns to ensure the consistency is even. If space permits, roll out all the dough rectangles before filling.
