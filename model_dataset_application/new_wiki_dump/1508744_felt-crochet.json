  "text":" With a Washing Machine Place your crocheted project in a mesh lingerie bag, or use a zippered pillowcase to keep loose fibers from escaping into your washing machine.  Toss the bag or pillowcase into the washing machine, along with 1 or 2 other pieces of sturdy clothing, such as jeans, to add extra agitation.
