  "text":" Removing Your Bobbin Open the shuttle cover. The shuttle cover is located below the needle. If you find the metal plate where the needle pushes through with the thread, then you should see the shuttle cover on one side of the machine. Pull out the bobbin casing. The bobbin casing is located just inside the shuttle cover. It will look like a metal cylinder. Remove the bobbin from the casing. Slide out the bobbin. If your bobbin is secured within the casing, then you may have to open the casing first. Preparing the Thread Find the spool pin. The spool pin is a piece on your sewing machine that holds the thread while you wind the bobbin. It will be a cylindrical piece that fits the hole in the spool of thread. The spool pin is commonly located on the top or side of the machine. Loosen your thread. Start the spool or remove the end of the thread from the hook so that you can easily transfer thread from the spool once it's secured to the spool pin. Place your spool of thread on the spool pin. The spool pin should fit through the center of your thread. If it has a spool cap, place that on top of the thread to hold it in place. If your machine\u2019s spool pin is on top of the machine, it may not have a spool cap. Slide the end of your thread through the thread guide. Most machines have a piece with a small hole near the spool that helps you guide the thread either when winding a bobbin or when threading the machine. If your machine does not have a thread guide, then skip this step. Locate your machine\u2019s tension disk. Your machine will have a small metal piece that will convey the thread as it\u2019s wound around the bobbin. This piece should be near the thread guide and will look like a tiny knob. Wrap the thread around the tension disk once. Your thread should form a triangle when held taut, with the top of the triangle located at the tension disk. Don't let go of your thread. Winding the Bobbin Thread your bobbin. Your bobbin should have a tiny hole in the side. Some bobbins have several. Push the end of your thread through the hole in your bobbin. You only need to push the thread through one hole on one side. If your bobbin has more than one hole in it, you can use any of the holes. Find your bobbin winder. The bobbin winder is a cylindrical metal piece that looks similar to the spool pin and is about the size of the hole in the center of your bobbin. Next to the bobbin winder, you should see a round plastic piece. Put your bobbin on the winder. Line up the bobbin winder with the hole in the center of the bobbin and push the bobbin down onto the winder. Lock your bobbin winder. Push the bobbin winder toward the plastic disk next to the winder. When the your winder is securely in place, you should hear a click. Hold the end of the thread. As you start to wind the bobbin, hold the end of the thread that you looped through the hole in your bobbin to keep it from slipping back out. Push down on your foot pedal. Continuing working your pedal as your bobbin fills with thread. Move at a comfortable speed. You may want to start by pushing your pedal slowly to find your rhythm, but there\u2019s no reason to wind your bobbin at a slow speed. If your bobbin fills unevenly, you have likely wound your thread around the tension disk in the wrong spot. Check your placement of the thread. If you believe you have done it correctly, then wrap it a second time to ensure that your thread is winding evenly. If your thread catches on the notch of the spool, try turning the spool over and working in the opposite direction of that notch. Fill up your bobbin with thread. You may be unsure of how much thread you\u2019ll use, but it\u2019s a good idea to fill up your bobbin each time you wind it so that you don\u2019t run out of thread.

Be careful to not let go of the end of your thread on the bobbin so that it doesn\u2019t start to unwind. Push the bobbin winder back into the start position. You will again hear a click when the winder is securely in place. Remove the bobbin from the winder. Your bobbin is now full of thread and ready to use.",
