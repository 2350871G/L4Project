  "text":" Cut four light fabrics to the size 2.5\u201d x 7\u201d.  Cut four dark fabrics to the size 2.5\u201d x 7\u201d.  Cut flannel to the size 2\u201d x 6\u201d (4 strips).  Pair light fabrics with dark fabrics, right sides together.  Sew a quarter inch seam along both long sides (7\u201d). Set your new seams. Press pairs with seams down the middle.  Roll pairs between fingers to create a tube and press non-seamed long sides.  Seams should be pressed flat so they lay in the middle of the newly pressed tube and nest. Set each pair dark fabric side up. Sew a \u00bc\u201d seam at the top of each of the tubes and set the seam. The bottom of the tube should be left open for turning. Use a glue stick or fabric spray adhesive to tack flannel to the center of each of the wrong-side-out pairs.  Turn each of the four tubes right side out and press flat with seams down the middle of the tube.  Take each tube and turn raw edges inward a minimum of \u00bc\u201d, press if necessary.  Arrange your tubes so light and dark fabrics alternate.  Take your first two tubes and join the turned in ends with a zigzag stitch (decorative stitch is not recommended). Repeat with remaining two tubes. Join both pairs of tubes. Join long sides of each tube together by laying light fabric on top of neighboring tube's dark fabric, using a zigzag stitch. It is best to narrow your stitch and sew on the edges of the tubes to produce the smallest seam possible. If you make the seams too large, your thread catcher will shrink in diameter.
