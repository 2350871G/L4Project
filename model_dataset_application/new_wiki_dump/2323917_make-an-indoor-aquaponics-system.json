If you can't find the frame at IKEA, ask around to see if friends have a spare one, or make a request on a site like Freecycle.

It is not strictly necessary to have the 50 liter (13.2 US gal) plastic container fish tank at the bottom if you just put the container on the floor. You may want to trim the plastic lip on the top container to ensure a better fit; in this tutorial, the handles have been cut off the ends of the container as well.

This is where the water will exit the growbed. Place the 60mm bell siphon in the middle. This is a 60 mm piece of pipe with an airtight cap on the top.

This has holes drilled or cut out of it to allow the water to come in\u2013\u2013and to keep the roots and the media out! The cap is optional, but helps to keep things out of the bell siphon. Bell siphons can be tricky to get working. The mechanics of a siphon is relatively complicated, but you are really only concerned with the practical application of siphons to allow you to quickly empty a growbed into either a sump tank or fish tank using a simple mechanical method with no moving or electrical parts. Finishing up Once you have all the framework, the containers, and the plumbing set up, add water into the fish tank and start the pump up. Test to see if everything works properly, and to see if the system is watertight! Fill the top container (the growbed) with some sort of growing media. This could be hydroton, lava rock, perlite, river stones or other similar matter. Use something that allows the water to flow through the growbed and is non-toxic.
