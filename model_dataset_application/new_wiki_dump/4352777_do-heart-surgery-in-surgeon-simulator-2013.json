You just need to tap it briefly and continuously until they're removed. After cutting the rib cage, pick it up and remove it from the patient's body. Using the hammer. The hammer does the same job but a tad quicker. To use the hammer, simply pick it up then swing it towards the rib cage.

There are two ways to do this:\nUsing the knife, cut the upper heart valves until it stops beating. There are four valves, and if you look closely, you can see the creases where you have to cut. Cut quickly since the blood level will quickly decrease. Alternative, you can use the cutter or other sharp tool to slice the valves. Some players tend to lose the tools they use because of the doctor's clumsy hands. Keep in mind to watch the blood level; if it goes down too fast, make sure to inject your patient to stabilize their blood flow."

If you can't pick up the heart, check the veins again. You might have missed the upper veins of the heart; cut it with the knife or any bladed tool. You can tell when the heart has been successfully removed since it will fall deeper into the patient's body."
