That's when you'll find the most flavorful, crunchy asparagus that will freeze well and still taste good when it thaws. Look for green, fresh-looking asparagus. Pick it up. If it's floppy, it's no longer fresh. The spears should be firm and crunchy. Choose thick spears, rather than a thin-speared variety. Thick spears hold up better in the freezer.

Blanching Asparagus Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Choose a pot that can easily hold the asparagus pieces or spears you're blanching. Fill it 2/3 full with water. Bring the water to a rolling boil. Prepare an ice bath. While the water is coming to a boil, fill a large bowl with ice cubes and water.
