If you\u2019re unsure of which setting is voltage, read the instruction manual that came with the multimeter. A voltage read must never be done with Ohm or Ampere position set as you could damage your device."

Your multimeter should have a black and red cord, with clamps or leads attached to the ends of the cords. Attach the black clamp to the negative (-) terminal and the red one to the positive (+) terminal on your battery. Your battery may also have a plastic cap over the battery terminals. Lift the plastic cap to see the positive and negative nodes."

If the multimeter reads under 12 volts, it most likely means that your battery is weak and will need to be replaced soon. If the multimeter doesn't read anything, it may mean that the batteries in the meter are dead. It could also mean that the meter isn\u2019t connected properly to your vehicle\u2019s battery."

Turn the key in the ignition to start the vehicle, or press the ignition button if your vehicle has one. Take a look at your multimeter. The reading should have increased to around 13.8 volts while the car is idle. If your multimeter reads 13.8, it means that your alternator is properly charging your battery."
