      "description":"Wear old clothes and comfortable shoes. It is a dirty job so be prepared. Wear long pants to protect you legs. If your garage is prone to insects such as spiders, consider wearing gloves. It is also hard work so get help! Make it a family affair. Or offer to buy pizza if friends are coming to visit. Play music that everyone likes to lighten the atmosphere."

      "description":"For anyone who has a hard time parting with things use this rule:  if you haven\u2019t used it in the last year, get rid of it. Throw away anything that is broken. If you haven\u2019t fixed it, toss it. Make sure to also dispose of things properly. If you have old paint, cleaners, motor oil or other substances, contact the city to see where to take it."

Bins can be found at Home Improvement stores or discount stores. Make sure to buy large bins with tight closing lids. This will prevent insects from getting into the contents inside."

Pile them as high as you can so that you can easily get to them. With other items that don\u2019t fit into the bins, group them together and place them where it makes sense. If possible buy hooks for large garden tools such as rakes, for sporting equipment such as bikes and other unwieldy items."

If it has been sitting in your garage for several years for you to \u201csomeday get around to fix it\u201d, toss it. That one item is taking up valuable space. With all other useful items, have a garage sale or donate everything to a worthy charity such as Salvation Army."
