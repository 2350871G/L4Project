          "description":"Pour 1\u20132 tablespoons (15\u201330 mL) of oil into your skillet and place it on the cooktop over medium heat until the oil just begins to shimmer. Cut the Spam into 1 in (2.5 cm) slices and fry them for 2-3 minutes, then flip them and let them cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. Afterwards, they\u2019ll have a perfect crusty exterior and a soft, meaty center. Be careful not to burn your Spam. The meat product is precooked, so it won\u2019t need very long. Frying Spam is one of the best ways to prepare it if you\u2019ve never eaten it before and you\u2019re apprehensive about the texture.Tip: Add a drizzle of maple syrup to the skillet to balance out the saltiness of the Spam and give it a candy-like caramelized crust."

While the oven is warming up, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the slices of Spam on top, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each. Bake the Spam for 10-12 minutes, or until it starts to brown around the edges. If you\u2019re watching your waistline, bake your Spam slices on a grill pan or wire rack to drain off some of the excess fat."

Once the slices are heated through on their first side, flip them over and give them 1-2 more minutes, or until they reach the desired doneness. You\u2019ll know your Spam is ready to come off the grill when it\u2019s slightly darker in color and criss-crossed with perfect grill marks.

          "description":"One of the best things about Spam is that it comes fully cooked, which means it\u2019s not strictly necessary to cook it at all. This can be a major plus if the power goes out, you find yourself without the proper cookware, or you\u2019re just looking for something quick, easy, and filling to wolf down. Bring a few cans of Spam along with you on your next all-day hike or camping trip. Since it doesn\u2019t require heating, it makes a perfect high-protein snack to gobble down on the go. Keep in mind that when eaten straight from the can, Spam has a softer, gelatinous texture which many people find unappetizing."

Wrap a sheet of nori (roasted seaweed) around your filling ingredients to hold them together.

Fry your Spam donuts in a spacious skillet filled with 2 inches (5.1 cm) of cooking oil for about 2 minutes per side and allow them to cool for an additional 2-3 minutes before getting your munch on. To keep your frying oil from scorching between batches, use an oil with a high smoke point, like olive, vegetable, canola, or peanut. If you\u2019d like a little more donut with your Spam donuts, dice the canned meat into tiny cubes and mix it by hand into rings of homemade dough to turn it into a filling."
