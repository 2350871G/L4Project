          "description":"Many vacuums come with a dusting attachment that allows you to affix a brush over the vacuum\u2019s hose, making it easy to dust surfaces without having to worry about scattering dust everywhere. You\u2019ll need a dusting attachment if you choose to vacuum your ceiling fan. If your vacuum doesn\u2019t have one, they can usually be purchased for around $10. For best results, use a dusting attachment that is wide and flat, not circular."

You may need to be elevated to reach the top of the fan blades if you\u2019re short, have high ceilings or if the dusting attachment on your vacuum doesn\u2019t have a curved structure. Make sure you\u2019re able to move the vacuum hose along the length of the fan blade from where you\u2019re positioned. If need be, find a crate or step-stool to lift you closer to the fan. When standing on an object for support, be careful that the sweeping motions you make to clean the fan don\u2019t sway you off balance."

Complete a full sweep of each blade, moving the hose slowly in a single direction first, then going back over the blade to catch any dust that you missed. Make each pass with the vacuum smooth and straight, rather than jerky back-and-forth motions, which can send dust flying."
