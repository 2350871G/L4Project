No product has universally helpful reviews, and it's difficult to tell in advance which one will work for your mower model and lawn conditions. Here are a few possibilities:\nA lanolin-based product such as Fluid Film leaves a non-drying coat. Some people swear by it, but others find that grass sticks even more to this coat. Test it on a small patch first. Cold galvanization compound is a highly water resistant treatment for unpainted metal surfaces. This might be a good choice in wet climates, but dirt and debris may still wear it down much sooner than the label suggests. Other heavy-duty rust protection products all have mixed reviews. POR-15 is one of the more popular options."

They can help you identify which type of lawn mower blade you have, and sell you a \"high lift\" blade compatible with your model. This increases airflow and ejects the grass clippings with more force. If your lawn mower cuts the grass into small pieces so you do not need to collect the clippings, you have mulching blades. These are low to the ground and most vulnerable to grass buildup, especially on a wet lawn. Low blades are also worse for the grass, since they scalp the dirt and tear grass out by the roots."
