Before you speak, think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. Whatever it is that you're wanting to talk about, put some thought into it. Use \u201cI\u201d statements and say, \u201cI want to discuss my feelings about gaming and why it's important to me\u201d instead of \u201cGaming is important to me and I don't want you to take it away from me.\u201d\nChoose a time when both of you are calm and not rushed to do anything. State what you want upfront. Say, \u201cIt would mean a lot to me if you understood gaming, and I want to share it with you.\u201d"

Look at her body language, facial expressions, and nonverbal cues. Check in to see if you're interpreting her feelings correctly.
