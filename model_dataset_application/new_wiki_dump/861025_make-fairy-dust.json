          "description":"Making fairy dust to sprinkle outside simply requires glitter, in any colors you like, and a non-toxic powder. The powder you use can vary. You can use talcum powder, sidewalk chalk, which you will need to grind into a powder, or salt. You may also want to get a fun container, such as a small decorative bottle, to hold the fairy dust. Whatever you use to hold the fairy dust, it's a good idea to use something with a sturdy lid. The amounts of glitter and powder you will need varies depending on how much fairy dust you want to make but the ratio of glitter of talcum powder should be 2 to 1. Any glitter will work for this method but buying super fine glitter will make the best fairy dust."

You may need to use a funnel to get the fairy dust into a container, depending on how small the opening is. If you don't have one, simply roll up a small piece of paper into a funnel shape and use a piece of tape to keep it in that shape. Cut the bottom of the funnel shape with a pair of scissors, making sure that the bottom of the funnel will fit into the container you want to put the fairy dust in."

Most kids will enjoy simply throwing small handfuls into the air and watching the sparkles fly through the air! Do not let your child eat this fairy dust. It is not edible and could cause problems they ingest it."
