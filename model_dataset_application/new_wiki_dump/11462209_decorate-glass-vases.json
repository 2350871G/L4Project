Apply a layer of mod podge to the vase using a craft foam brush, and place the tissue paper shapes on the vase so they stick to the adhesive. Dab the vase with a final layer of mod podge to ensure the tissue paper stays in place. For example, cut green, blue, and purple tissue paper into squares and create a mosaic pattern on the vase. Cut the tissue paper into circles made up of many different colors and adhere them to the vase randomly for a dotted vase."

Tie the ribbon around the vase in a bow, or cut the ribbon so it\u2019s just long enough to fit around the vase and glue it in place in a single stripe. To use twine, wrap several layers of twine around the vase and tie it off in a simple bow. Tie a large gold ribbon around the vase, or cut several strands of white, yellow, and orange ribbon to glue them around a vase in parallel lines."

Spread the glue in a thin even layer using a foam craft brush, and sprinkle the glitter onto the glue in a thick layer. Gently shake the excess glitter off to reveal your glittered vase. Cover an entire vase in silver glitter, or place a piece of painter\u2019s tape around the middle of the vase and apply glitter to the bottom half. Create a design using glue before sprinkling the glitter onto the vase for a more intricate design."

Cut out the shapes you\u2019d like from the paper, remove the adhesive backing, and press the paper onto the vase. For example, cut out flowers or leaves from the adhesive paper and stick them onto your vase. Cut adhesive paper into strips to create a striped pattern on your vase."

Add a final layer of mod podge over the lace if needed. Doilies will also work well as a less expensive option. Consider spraying the vase with a sealant that won't be as visible as the mod podge."

Cover the areas of the stencil you want on your vase before carefully lifting the stencil off of the vase to reveal your decoration. Tape the stencil in place onto the vase using painter\u2019s tape if you\u2019re worried about it moving.

Paint each section of the taped off vase a different color using acrylic paint to create a geometric design. Cut the painter\u2019s tape into thinner strips if you want smaller divisions between the colors. Wait for the paint to begin drying before peeling off the tape."
