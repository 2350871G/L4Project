Use the pliers to twist the metal part of the bulb in a counter-clockwise motion. The metal may tear off in strips, but this should actually make it easier to pull out. If there is any broken glass still attached to the bulb, you can use the pliers to keep your hands safely away or to pull out the glass before touching the rest of the bulb."

Cut a long piece of duct tape, and roll it back on itself to create a sticky wad about the size of your broken light bulb. Stick the wad into the center of the bulb and apply a bit of pressure, and then turn the bulb counterclockwise.

Simply push the soap up into the broken bulb; the glass will harmlessly become stuck in the soap, and the soap will give you a means to twist the base. Spin the soap/bulb counter-clockwise to remove it from the socket. You may need to wipe off any soap residue that remains after taking out the glass."
