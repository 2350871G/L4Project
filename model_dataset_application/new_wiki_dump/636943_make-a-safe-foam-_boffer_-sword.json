  "text":" Cut your pipe. Make sure to subtract 2 or maybe 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the total since your pommel will be 1 inch (2.5 cm) and the tip can be anywhere from 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm). Mark off where the handle will be. Don't forget to leave some room for a pommel on the end. Starting from the top of the handle, measure to the end of the pipe and cut two pieces of foam pad that long and 1 1/2\" wide.  Put your double sided tape in the center of these pieces and put them onto the PVC pipe opposite each other. From the end it should look like this:   |O| Now cut 2 more pieces the same length but only as wide as the space between the other two pieces. You are going to tape them to the pipe, making a box of foam around the core (the pipe). Cut a block of foam to put over the end. The wider, 1 1/2\" pieces will be the \"flat\" and the thinner pieces the \"blade\". Duct tape the end to prevent the pipe end from scratching the foam and then tape down your end cap. You can bevel this a little since we're going to be putting strips of foam around it for a blade in the next few steps. Now, measure up each \"blade\" and across the top, and cut a 1 1/2\" wide strip that long (allow about an inch more to be safe). For example, a 20\" blade and an end cap 2\" wide would need about 43\" (both sides and end cap +1\"). Apply that to the \"blade\" on one side with the double sided tape, across the top, and down the other blade. Do this at least once more, re-measuring since the size will have changed.  Cut two more pieces. Now the sword is 1 1/2\" thick on the blade, but only 1/2\" on the flat. Cut 2 pieces that will go up the flat side that is about 2\" wide and stops before it goes over the tip of the sword. Tape those on the flats. Now wrap a little regular duct tape around the base (not too tight)to hold it together. You can also tape the tip to the last flat pieces you added to provide some stability. To make a pommel, wrap a 1\" wide strip around the handle and attach with double-sided tape and wrap in regular tape. Make an end cap and attach that. Then do it again with a 1 1/2\" wide strip, this time wrapping over the previous piece of foam and cap that off with an end cap. Wrap your pommel in Duct tape and use grip tape to tape up the handle.  (OPTIONAL) You can add a cross guard if you like. To do so make 2 or 3 strips of 1\" wide foam that are longer than your sword is wide, cut a hole in the center and a slit on one side of the hole. Open the slit and slide over the handle and tape to the handle and blade. Slip the two trouser socks over the blade and tape them to the crossguard and/or handle.  Go enjoy some safe foam combat. ",
