      "description":"This will act as a scratching post for the cat so they won't scratch the grass and pull it out. Make sure the tree isn't too soft so the cat won't destroy it. Growing catnip around the tree will help getting them to scratch the tree. If you can't plant a tree or are worried about your pet damaging a tree, a small children's climbing frame or large cat centre adapted for use outdoors can work as well."

      "description":"The cat will be happy if there is a door to go inside and out, cats don't want to be locked in or out. Cats change their mind often. Giving them a choice will make them much happier. An electronic cat flap that recognises your cats microchip or electronic is the best to prevent outside intruders (such as neighbouring cats and wild animals) coming in to your house."

      "headline":"Store all chemicals in a garden shed with a good lock.",
      "description":"Cats usually don't try to eat chemicals but if they happen to lean against one, they will lick it off and may become poisoned. Make sure you don't lock the cat in the shed. Check for cracks and windows in the shed. The cat may find a way to sneak in and be unable to get out. Try preventing the cat getting into the shed by:\nPlacing a sheet of corrugated iron over the crack or window. Spraying a cat repellent around the shed. Tea tree and eucalyptus oil will ward them off. Planting a strong smelling plant such as capsicum (peppers), chilli or a citrus tree."

Use netting that has very small holes -- small enough so that the cat cannot stick its paw in. If you are unable to get this kind of netting use a plastic sheet. For fishponds, use a clear plastic sheet."
