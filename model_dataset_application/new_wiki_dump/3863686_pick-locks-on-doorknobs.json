  "text":" Using Two Hairpins Bend one of the hairpins open until the ends are ninety degrees apart. Be careful not to bend the pin too far and risk cracking the metal. You don\u2019t want to end up with two separate pieces. Your hair pin should be in the shape of an \u201cL\u201d at this point. Remove the plastic pieces from the end. You can usually bite these off with your teeth. You can also remove them by gripping them with a pair of pliers and pulling them off, or by scraping them away with a butter knife. Bend one of the tips about forty-five degrees. This can be done by inserting the end into the lock itself and then bending the pin to one side. This should give you a tiny bend at the end about an inch long. Avoid over bending it. This is not a ninety-degree bend like the last one. Bend the other end into a handle.

Take the other end and fold it  in half over itself so that you have a small \u201cV\u201d shape (about twenty degree angle) that can act like a handle. Get a second hairpin. You\u2019ll need one more hairpin that will be inserted into the lock to help you turn it. Bend the top of the second hairpin about seventy-degrees. Don\u2019t unfold the hairpin like you did the last one. Instead, use a pair of pliers to bend the closed end of the hairpin about seventy-degrees. You can also try the same method you used for the first hairpin. Stick the end into the lock and then pull down until the hairpin is bent. Insert the closed end of the second hairpin (the lever) into the keyhole. The lever is going to act as a guide for your lock pick as well as allow you to turn the lock once the pins are all pushed into place. The open end will act as a handle, allowing you to turn the lever and apply pressure to the pins inside the lock. Turn the lever slightly. Turn the lever softly but firmly in the same direction you would turn your key to unlock the door. The lock will catch on the pins and you\u2019ll feel some resistance. Keep this pressure on the barrel while you begin picking the lock. Slide the lock pick (your first hairpin) into the lock just above the lever. The end that is arced should be pointed upward so that the tip of the pick can work at pushing the lock pins up. Feel around for a stuck or \u201cseized\u201d pin. Keeping pressure on the lock with your lever, start to push your lock pick forward, using an up and down motion to feel past the pins. Some of the pins may move up and down fairly easily. Push by them until you find a \u201cseized\u201d pin. This one will be much harder to move. Work the seized pin until you hear a click. Work your lock pick up and down on the seized pin until you hear it click into place with the barrel. This is the sound of the barrel moving slightly to the side which separates the break in the pin and keeps it from securing the lock. Work the other pins the same way. Once you\u2019ve taken care of one pin another will become stuck or seized. Find that one and start to work it in the same way. Remember to keep pressure on the lever. Work the pick in an up and down motion. Trust how the pins feel on the pick and allow it to direct your movements. Turn the lever to open the lock. Once you feel like you\u2019ve dealt with all of the pins, put more pressure on your lever and the lock should open. If the lock does not open you may have pushed one of the pins up too high. You can try to remedy this by easing up on some of the pressure on your lever. This may allow that pin to fall back down, but it could also allow other pins to fall and cause you to have to start over. Using a Credit Card Make sure you have a spring bolt lock. A spring bolt lock is a spring loaded lock with an angled edge. It is one of the most common types of locks. The credit card method will not work with other types of locks. Spring bolt locks are usually found on doorknobs. If your door has a deadbolt, this method will not work. Choose a card you can replace. This method will almost surely bend your card and could risk breaking it. Rather than using your debit or ATM card, consider using an expired gift card, a rewards card from your grocery store, or a credit card you do not use often and that can be easily replaced. Insert the card between the door and the frame. Slide the card in right where the latch for the lock is, next to the doorknob itself. The card will have to bend to make it in. Move the card up and down while pushing firmly forward. You\u2019re trying to get the card to catch the latch that is holding the door closed. This latch has a smooth side that is sloped at an angle. You\u2019re goal is to slide the card up along that smooth side which will push the latch in. Bend the card away from the door. This puts pressure on the latch itself and forces it away from the doorway and back into the door. Turn the knob as you work the card. Start turning the knob to open the door as you push the card in. The door should open as the card slides past the latch, freeing the knob to turn. Opening a Push Button Lock Gather your tools. Push button locks are often found on interior doors. Usually bedrooms and bathrooms inside a home. They have a button on the inside doorknob that the occupant can push to engage the lock. Push button locks can be opened from the outside using a number of different items. Anything long and straight that will fit inside the hole in the center of the doorknob should work. Consider using a hairpin, paperclip, or wire clothes hanger. Locate the hole. Most push button locks will have a small hole right in the center of the doorknob. If you don\u2019t see it, check the stem of the knob or the area around where the knob is connected to the door. You should see a small hole. Insert the paperclip into the hole and push. Push the pin into the hole until you feel it catch. Apply pressure and push the pin forward. You should hear a click. The push button lock should pop open.",
