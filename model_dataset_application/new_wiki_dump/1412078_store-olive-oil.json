The ideal spot for olive oil is a root cellar or cold cellar that\u2019s both cool and dark, but a cooler pantry in your kitchen will also work. You can store the oil in the refrigerator, though this isn't necessary if you can keep the oil at the right temperature outside of the refrigerator. In hot and humid climates where the temperature is typically 80 F (27 C) or hotter, storing the oil in the refrigerator will help to preserve it. Oil stored in the refrigerator will solidify and become cloudy, so you'll need to warm it up to room temperature before you can use it. Simply transfer it to the pantry and wait about half an hour for it to become liquid again."
