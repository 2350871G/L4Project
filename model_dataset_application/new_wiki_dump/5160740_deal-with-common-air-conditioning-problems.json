If the pipe is not draining correctly, water can leak on your floor, in attic space/ceiling, basement or on your roof. This can cause a lot more problems if not detected quickly and repaired (window A/C units usually drip outside, directly below the widow unit)."

      "headline":"Diagnose noise issues.",
