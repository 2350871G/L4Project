Stir in the lye with your hand slowly once they have reached the right temperature. Stir the oils and lye for about 5 minutes in a mixing bowl. If available, use an immersion blender so that as much soap touches the lye as possible. Trace is when the soap looks and feels like vanilla pudding. It should be thick with a light colour.
