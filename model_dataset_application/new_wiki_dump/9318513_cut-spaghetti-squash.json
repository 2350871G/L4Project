  "text":" Cutting an Uncooked Squash in Half Use a knife to make marks where you will cut. Spaghetti squash skin is notoriously thick, so you will need a really sharp knife for this. Use your knife to make a small series of punctures in the skin around the perimeter of the squash. The end result should be like a dotted line that you can use as a guide later on.

The squash should be soft enough now that you can cut all the way through it. Then, pull the squash apart and cook it to your liking. Cutting a Squash for Long Strands Microwave the squash for 5 minutes to get softer skin. Microwaving isn't necessary, but it does help soften up the notoriously tough spaghetti squash skin.
