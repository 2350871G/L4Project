          "description":"Different types of chemical weed-killing sprays are better suited for killing different varieties of weed. Read the information on the label to determine which best suits your needs. Some weed killers are sold in large spray cans, while others are intended for spot application. Chemical sprays work most effectively on broadleaf weeds, such as dandelions and other non-grassy weeds. You can find chemical sprays on sale at a plant nursery or even a large supermarket."

          "headline":"Wear clothing that protects your eyes, mouth, and skin while applying weed killer.",
          "description":"Weed killers contain harmful chemicals and should be treated accordingly. Wear eye protection while spraying your lawn. To prevent yourself from inhaling chemicals, wear a surgical mask or bandana over your mouth. Wear long sleeves, long pants, and rubber gloves to keep weed killer off of your skin. If you have young children or pets in your home, keep them off of the lawn for 24 hours following the application of chemical spray. Weed killers could harm children or pets who accidentally ingest any of the chemicals."

          "headline":"Spot-kill weeds with a small applicator.",
          "description":"If your lawn only has a handful of small weed infestations, you can use a spot-killer to spray the chemical directly onto the weeds. Hold the spot-kill applicator near the ground and target the weeds\u2019 leaves and the bottoms of their stems. Spot killing weeds works most effectively if the individual weed patches are under 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter."

          "description":"If the weeds on your lawn have grown into patches that are too large for a spot killer, you\u2019ll need a large volume of weed killer to remove them. Purchase a 1\u20132 gallons (3.8\u20137.6 L) tank at your local hardware store or gardening center. Then, walk through your yard and spray the chemical onto weed patches from a height of about 4 inches (10 cm). Like the spot-killer applicator, these tanks will be pressurized. Most large tanks will have a handle on top, although some may have 1 or 2 straps so you can hook the tank over your shoulders."

          "description":"If your entire lawn is infested with weeds, you may need even more spraying power than the large tank affords. Attach a dial sprayer to your garden hose, and add a concentrated weed killer to the attached tank. Turn the dial so that about 2.5 tablespoons (37 mL) of weed killer is mixed in with every 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Then spray the weed killer across your lawn. A dial sprayer and the concentrated chemical killer can be purchased at a hardware store, garden center, or plant nursery."

Bend a thin sheet of plastic or cardboard into a cylinder, and place this around the weed. Then spray the organic weed killer as close to the weed as possible, so that it stays contained within the plastic cylinder. You could also cut the top and bottom off of a 2-liter soda bottle and place that over the weeds to contain the spread of the weed killer spray."

In this case, spray an organic killer over a large area of weed-infested lawn. A few days later, you can walk over the lawn and pick out all the dead weeds. You can then reseed the ground so that a healthier and weed-free lawn will grow next year."
