Direct the ends so that they cut through the center of the flower structure. Feed the right wire end through the right side of the round bead and the left wire end through the left side of the round bead.

Once you've mounted the flower, use cutting pliers to trim the remaining wire. Hide the sharp wire ends beneath the beads. Method Two: Plastic Bag Flower Cut nine lengths of wire. Use wire cutters to cut nine 9-inch (23-cm) lengths of jewelry wire. Each length of wire will be used to form one petal. You can create fewer or more petals as desired, but nine will allow you to make a simple rose. Bend each wire into a petal shape. Use your fingers to bend one wire into a 2-inch (5-cm) loop. Twist the ends together at the bottom of the loop two or three times to secure the shape. Repeat with all nine pieces of wire. To create smaller or larger petals, simply form smaller or larger loops. Cut squares of plastic. Use scissors to cut nine 4-inch (10-cm) squares of colored plastic. You need one square per petal. Each square must be large enough to wrap around the length and width of the petal frame. Plastic bag material works best for this, but you could also use cellophane or plastic wrap. For a completely different look, sheer colored tights could be used instead of plastic. Wrap the plastic over the wire frame. Center one wire petal frame over one plastic square.

It will bunch up slightly as you twist it, however. Twist the ends of the plastic together like you would twist the paper onto a lollipop. Repeat with each wire frame and square of plastic.

This petal will sit at the center of the flower. Wrap three petals around the first. Take a second plastic petal and position it next to the first rolled petal.

Pencils are the easiest option to use for this craft, but you could also use a wooden dowel trimmed down to pencil length, 7.5 inches (19 cm). Fold and cut the first wrapper.

You will need to fold the cupcake wrapper in half three times. This will create a flower with eight petals. Alternatively, you can fold the wrapper in half four times and round off the top in a similar manner to create a flower with 16 petals. Repeat with four more cupcake wrappers. Repeat the folding and cutting step with four more cupcake wrappers to create four more layers of petals. To create an aesthetically even flower, use identical cupcake wrappers and cut the same number of petals for each one. If desired, you can also experiment by using different colors or by varying the number of petals. Cut the leaves. Fold a green cupcake wrapper into eighths, then round off one long edge. You will need to fold the wrapper in half three times. Round off the open long edge of the folded wrapper. Make sure that the point stays intact. Stack the layers. Unfold the cut wrappers and stack them on top one another. The green leaves should be placed on the bottom, but the petal layers do not need to go in any specific order. Turn the petal layers slightly so that there are no visible gaps when viewed from above. Consider using a small dot of hot glue in between each layer. Place the glue directly onto the center of one layer before placing the next layer over it. Attach the flower to the stem. Center the flower, leaf-side down, over the eraser of the wrapped pencil. Drive a small push pin through the center of all six flower layers and into the eraser. If you are using a wooden dowel or are otherwise unable to use the push pin method, simply adhere the bottom of the flower onto one end of the stem with a small dab of hot glue.

The first strip should be 45 inches (114 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) wide. The second strip should be 45 inches (114 cm) long and 5 inches (12.5 cm) wide. Experiment with different types of fabric to produce different results. Most medium-weight or heavy-weight fabrics will be easy to work with, especially if they are fray-resistant. Avoid lightweight materials, stretchy materials, or materials that fray easily. Press the edges. Fold the long edges of both strips. Use a hot iron to press along the folded edges, holding them in place. For each edge, you should fold down roughly 1/4 inch (0.6 cm). The exact measurement doesn't matter too much for this project, but the fold must be even along the entire edge. Fold both strips in half. Fold both strips in half crosswise, halving the total length from 45 inches (114 cm) to approximately 22.5 inches (57 cm). Use an iron to press this fold, as well. Tie a knot with the thinner strip. Tie an overhand knot into one end of the thinner strip. Position the knot as close to the end as possible. This knot will give you a starting point for the rolls you'll need to form. It should also prevent this end of the material from fraying. Roll and twist the smaller strip around this knot. Roll the fabric around the knot one full rotation.
