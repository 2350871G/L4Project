Again, be upfront about it and plan a day when you\u2019ll help them do the sorting of their toys, clothes and books. Arrange to go with them to your family favorite charity and this way they can feel better, knowing someone in need will make good use of what they\u2019re sharing."

Making sure they know about your move will help create a net of supporting people for you and the children. Ask them if it\u2019s possible to organize a farewell party, which can be as simple as juices and home-made cupcakes for your children\u2019s classmates. Take pictures and allow your children to make an album as a keepsake."
