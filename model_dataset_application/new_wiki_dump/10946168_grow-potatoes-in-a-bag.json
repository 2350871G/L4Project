Avoid storing them in a plastic bag as the potatoes will \u201csweat\u201d and begin to rot. Store potatoes separate from onions and fruit. These give off ethylene gas that can cause your potatoes to sprout prematurely. Store your potatoes in the dark. Prolonged exposure to light can cause a chemical build up that will cause potatoes to turn green and produce a bitter taste. This has been known to cause illness if consumed in large quantities."
