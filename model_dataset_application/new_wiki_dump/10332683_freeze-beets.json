When trimming the beets, leave at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the roots and \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of the stems. If any more is removed, the beets may bleed during the cooking process. Don\u2019t throw the greens away if they are fresh! You can use them in a salad or cook them like spinach and add vinegar, salt, and pepper for added flavor."

Boiling is the most common way of cooking beets, but they can also be oven roasted.
