Focus initially on exchanging ingredients with similar textures and flavors. And make sure you\u2019re sticking to fundamental ratios when doing so.

They\u2019ll also help you avoid repeating mistakes if you make it again.

Have fun with it but still be descriptive enough that it\u2019s clear what will be made. If you\u2019ve adapted it from one or more other recipes, give credit where it\u2019s due by next noting it's an adaptation of a particular recipe. Beneath that list the number of servings and serving size, if appropriate."

          "headline":"List the ingredients next.",
          "description":"The ingredients list lets the person making the recipe (or you, if you\u2019re making it again) formulate a preparation and cooking plan. List the ingredients in the order they\u2019ll be used in the recipe. Use precise measurements and indicate if they need preparation. For instance, instead of writing \u201c1 clove of garlic\u201d when the instructions later say to \u201cadd 1/2 tablespoon minced garlic,\u201d write \u201c1/2 tablespoon garlic, minced.\u201d\nIf an ingredient is used more than once in a recipe, list it where it\u2019s first used. Then write \u201cdivided\u201d after it, set off by a comma. So, for example, if a recipe calls for 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to first saut\u00e9 vegetables and to later create a vinaigrette, you\u2019d write, \u201c6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided.\u201d\nIf a dish has different elements, such as a pie has a crust and a filling, break up the ingredients list with headings such as \u201cCrust\u201d and \u201cFilling.\u201d\nDon\u2019t use two numerals together; set the second off with parentheses. For example: \u201c1 (12-pounce) package of cream cheese.\u201d\nBe literal in your measurements. A \u201ccup of chopped spinach\u201d isn\u2019t the same as a \u201ccup of spinach, chopped.\u201d The latter would obviously have much less. Capitalize ingredients that start with a letter instead of a number. For example: \u201cSea salt to taste.\u201d\nIf preparing an ingredient is easy, set its description off with a comma after the ingredient. For example, \u201c1 stick of butter, melted.\u201d\nUse generic names rather than brand names. So, for instance, say whipped cream instead of Cool Whip."

Make sure each step is in the proper order as well. You don\u2019t have to write in sentences, but you can. This is your recipe, so write it in your words and style. Be descriptive  by providing visual cues like \u201cbarely translucent,\u201d \u201cgolden, pebbly top,\u201d \u201calmost iridescent,\u201d etc. Also give warnings when something is tricky or dangerous. State exact or approximate cooking times, with descriptors to indicate when something is done. Separate each step into a new paragraph. If you're mixing all dry ingredients in one bowl, for example, make that one step (and its own paragraph). As with the ingredient list, separate different parts of the process with headers. The second to last instruction should involve plating, garnishing and the temperature at which it should be served. The final instruction should discuss storage, if that applies. For example, \u201cFreeze muffins individually in plastic wrap for up to 30 days.\u201d"

          "description":"Salt isn\u2019t, as most think, used in a dish so it will tasty salty. Instead, it has three functions: to reduce bitterness, enhance sweetness and to heighten the aromas and natural tastes of other ingredients. While not all dishes need salt, it generally enhances the overall flavor of most so they don\u2019t taste flat. If you have a dish that tastes flat or bitter, try adding a three-fingered pinch of salt before anything else. Taste it again. If it\u2019s still not right, add a little more and give it another taste. That might be all it takes. If not, proceed to balancing in other ways. Salt absorbs into food as it sits. If you add too much salt, you can try increasing the sweet or sour components or by diluting the dish a bit with water. You can also try to compensate by adjusting the side dishes. For example, don\u2019t salt the rice or add a sweet or sour side dish. To avoid over-concentration when reducing liquids, add salt after the liquid is reduced."

          "headline":"Find sweet outside of sugar.",
          "description":"The taste of sweet is a great contrast to sour and salty tastes. It can help balance dishes with ingredients having these tastes or if a dish\u2019s flavor becomes too salty or sour. While the sweet taste in most foods comes from sugars \u2013 cane sugar (granulated, turbinado, brown, powdered, bakers, fruit, etc.) and beet sugar \u2013 it can also come from molasses, maple syrup, honey, carrots, mango and other sweet foods. So consider these as alternatives when creating your recipes. Sweet really benefits from sour, which is why a squeeze of lemon juice over a fruit salad or cream cheese frosting on cake work so well together. Unfortunately, because people are consuming more and more packaged foods that often have a lot of high fructose corn syrup and the like, we have become more tolerant of sweetness and require more of it to taste it."

That\u2019s because sour as a taste brings out the natural flavors in foods. It also balances sweetness and spiciness and enhances saltiness. It\u2019s generally found in acidic foods like limes, lemons, oranges, sour cream, yogurt and pickled veggies. It\u2019s also in vinegars like balsamic, sherry, red, apple cider and rice. Many other fruits are also classified as sour: raspberries, blueberries, red currants and grapes. If a dish is too sour, add something sweet or something with fat to balance it. Sour also helps to balance foods that are too spicy."

Chocolate and coffee are naturally bitter, as are olives; greens like radicchio, arugula, dandelion and kale; hops; bitter melon; brussel sprouts; turnips; chicory; and grapefruit. Pomegranate juice is used often as well. Experiment with adding arugula, chicory and endive to your salads; thicken sauces with unsweetened chocolate; or deglaze with a bitter liqueur Campari instead of a juice or stock."

          "description":"The last taste discovered, umami, is described as savory or mouthwatering, though there\u2019s not an exact translation from Japanese to English. It amplifies the flavor of a dish and is found in a variety of meats, such as beef, pork, chicken, and cured ham; vegetables, such as shitake mushrooms, truffles, Chinese cabbage, soy beans, and sweet potatoes; seafood, such as prawns, squid, tuna, mackerel, seaweed, and shellfish; and cheeses like parmesan, Gruyere, and Swiss. It\u2019s also in green tea, tomatoes and soy sauce. Bacon also triggers the umami taste. Aging, curing, ripeness and fermenting all enhance umami. Going overboard is difficult to correct.

But remember that ultimately the tastes must be balanced, or the modification will not have the flavor you want. Take detailed notes each time you modify a recipe. You won\u2019t be able to recreate it if you don\u2019t. Your notes will also help you determine what didn't work in your modified recipe. They\u2019ll also help you avoid repeating mistakes if you make it again. Here are things to include in your notes: the necessity of an ingredient, its impact on the flavor, how it reacted to other ingredients (e.g., soggy raisins in baked goods), and if it is a structural, signature or accent ingredient. Evaluate the modified recipe. Ask yourself these questions: Was it improved or not? What did/did not work? Why? What was the final form of the recipe? Would you change anything? Considering these things will help you think of modifying recipes as a process of simply molding them as you choose. It will also make improvising easier and more intuitive in the future. The last step is to write the recipe once you\u2019ve modified it to your liking. Writing Your Recipe Give it a name. Start your recipe card, or whatever you choose to use to write or type out your new recipe on, with the name of your new dish. Have fun with it but still be descriptive enough that it\u2019s clear what will be made. If you\u2019ve adapted it from one or more other recipes, give credit where it\u2019s due by next noting it's an adaptation of a particular recipe. Beneath that list the number of servings and serving size, if appropriate. List the ingredients next. The ingredients list lets the person making the recipe (or you, if you\u2019re making it again) formulate a preparation and cooking plan. List the ingredients in the order they\u2019ll be used in the recipe. Use precise measurements and indicate if they need preparation. For instance, instead of writing \u201c1 clove of garlic\u201d when the instructions later say to \u201cadd 1/2 tablespoon minced garlic,\u201d write \u201c1/2 tablespoon garlic, minced.\u201d\nIf an ingredient is used more than once in a recipe, list it where it\u2019s first used. Then write \u201cdivided\u201d after it, set off by a comma. So, for example, if a recipe calls for 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to first saut\u00e9 vegetables and to later create a vinaigrette, you\u2019d write, \u201c6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided.\u201d\nIf a dish has different elements, such as a pie has a crust and a filling, break up the ingredients list with headings such as \u201cCrust\u201d and \u201cFilling.\u201d\nDon\u2019t use two numerals together; set the second off with parentheses. For example: \u201c1 (12-pounce) package of cream cheese.\u201d\nBe literal in your measurements. A \u201ccup of chopped spinach\u201d isn\u2019t the same as a \u201ccup of spinach, chopped.\u201d The latter would obviously have much less. Capitalize ingredients that start with a letter instead of a number. For example: \u201cSea salt to taste.\u201d\nIf preparing an ingredient is easy, set its description off with a comma after the ingredient. For example, \u201c1 stick of butter, melted.\u201d\nUse generic names rather than brand names. So, for instance, say whipped cream instead of Cool Whip. Write the instructions. Think through the steps \u2013 including time spent pre-heating the oven, bringing the water to a boil or getting the grill going \u2013 and organize it to decrease dead time. Make sure each step is in the proper order as well. You don\u2019t have to write in sentences, but you can. This is your recipe, so write it in your words and style. Be descriptive  by providing visual cues like \u201cbarely translucent,\u201d \u201cgolden, pebbly top,\u201d \u201calmost iridescent,\u201d etc. Also give warnings when something is tricky or dangerous. State exact or approximate cooking times, with descriptors to indicate when something is done. Separate each step into a new paragraph. If you're mixing all dry ingredients in one bowl, for example, make that one step (and its own paragraph). As with the ingredient list, separate different parts of the process with headers. The second to last instruction should involve plating, garnishing and the temperature at which it should be served. The final instruction should discuss storage, if that applies. For example, \u201cFreeze muffins individually in plastic wrap for up to 30 days.\u201d Proof, sign and date. Check over your work for errors, give it a personal touch if you\u2019d like and sign and date it. If you wrote it on a recipe card, go online and get a vintage, metal recipe box and start filing away. If you printed them, create a recipe book using scrapbooking materials or a photo album. You can even create your own online recipe book on websites such as these: [5], [6], [7] or [8]. Balancing Recipes with the Six Tastes Learn the functions of salt. Salt isn\u2019t, as most think, used in a dish so it will tasty salty. Instead, it has three functions: to reduce bitterness, enhance sweetness and to heighten the aromas and natural tastes of other ingredients. While not all dishes need salt, it generally enhances the overall flavor of most so they don\u2019t taste flat. If you have a dish that tastes flat or bitter, try adding a three-fingered pinch of salt before anything else. Taste it again. If it\u2019s still not right, add a little more and give it another taste. That might be all it takes. If not, proceed to balancing in other ways. Salt absorbs into food as it sits. If you add too much salt, you can try increasing the sweet or sour components or by diluting the dish a bit with water. You can also try to compensate by adjusting the side dishes. For example, don\u2019t salt the rice or add a sweet or sour side dish. To avoid over-concentration when reducing liquids, add salt after the liquid is reduced. Find sweet outside of sugar. The taste of sweet is a great contrast to sour and salty tastes. It can help balance dishes with ingredients having these tastes or if a dish\u2019s flavor becomes too salty or sour. While the sweet taste in most foods comes from sugars \u2013 cane sugar (granulated, turbinado, brown, powdered, bakers, fruit, etc.) and beet sugar \u2013 it can also come from molasses, maple syrup, honey, carrots, mango and other sweet foods. So consider these as alternatives when creating your recipes. Sweet really benefits from sour, which is why a squeeze of lemon juice over a fruit salad or cream cheese frosting on cake work so well together. Unfortunately, because people are consuming more and more packaged foods that often have a lot of high fructose corn syrup and the like, we have become more tolerant of sweetness and require more of it to taste it. Brighten up dishes with sour. At many restaurants, bottles of vinegar are sitting on the table and lemon wedges are served on the side with a number of entrees. That\u2019s because sour as a taste brings out the natural flavors in foods. It also balances sweetness and spiciness and enhances saltiness. It\u2019s generally found in acidic foods like limes, lemons, oranges, sour cream, yogurt and pickled veggies. It\u2019s also in vinegars like balsamic, sherry, red, apple cider and rice. Many other fruits are also classified as sour: raspberries, blueberries, red currants and grapes. If a dish is too sour, add something sweet or something with fat to balance it. Sour also helps to balance foods that are too spicy. Beware and be fond of bitter. Bitter is offensive at best and inedible at worst when used in large quantities or when not balanced. But when in harmony with other tastes, particularly sweetness, it adds depth and richness to food. It\u2019s tarty edge also perks up the taste buds. Chocolate and coffee are naturally bitter, as are olives; greens like radicchio, arugula, dandelion and kale; hops; bitter melon; brussel sprouts; turnips; chicory; and grapefruit. Pomegranate juice is used often as well. Experiment with adding arugula, chicory and endive to your salads; thicken sauces with unsweetened chocolate; or deglaze with a bitter liqueur Campari instead of a juice or stock. Discover a fifth taste, umami. The last taste discovered, umami, is described as savory or mouthwatering, though there\u2019s not an exact translation from Japanese to English. It amplifies the flavor of a dish and is found in a variety of meats, such as beef, pork, chicken, and cured ham; vegetables, such as shitake mushrooms, truffles, Chinese cabbage, soy beans, and sweet potatoes; seafood, such as prawns, squid, tuna, mackerel, seaweed, and shellfish; and cheeses like parmesan, Gruyere, and Swiss. It\u2019s also in green tea, tomatoes and soy sauce. Bacon also triggers the umami taste. Aging, curing, ripeness and fermenting all enhance umami. Going overboard is difficult to correct. The best way is typically to add more ingredients that are not umami-rich. Don\u2019t forget other \u201ctastes\u201d in your recipes. While spicy, floral, earthy, minty, buttery, fruity and so forth aren\u2019t technically tastes in the sense that they aren\u2019t processed by our taste buds, they are tastes in the sense that they are notes in foods that we identify with dishes. For example, if something becomes too spicy, you can balance it with a sweet taste. Think of Mexican chocolate with its pinch of cayenne pepper.",
