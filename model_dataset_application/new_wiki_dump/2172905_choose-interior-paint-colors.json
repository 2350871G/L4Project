          "description":"Warm colors include red, orange, and yellow. The brightest tints of these colors are bold and vibrant but can be too strong when used often. More muted shades can make a room feel cozier, similar to a summer or autumn day. Warm colors work well in rooms that feature a lot of activity, such as living rooms. For example, use a deep shade of red on your walls, then pair it with yellow and orange decorations. Your room will look playful, like a leaf pile in fall. Use bright tints of warm colors as an accent. A bright yellow, for instance, can lighten up a room, but using it sparingly prevents it from feeling overwhelming. You can also add subtle warmth to a room by painting it in shades of white lightly tinted with warm colors.

For instance, if you have a bedspread that you love, you could choose a color from it and paint the walls that color. Or, if you have a prominent piece of art in the room, pick your favorite color from the piece and paint the walls that color.\""

They make for good choices in bedrooms and sitting rooms. Lighter shades can feel more vibrant, while darker shades can feel more soothing. For example, a light shade of blue can remind you of the water at the beach. A darker shade would feel much heavier. Cool colors can be used in rooms that feature a lot of activity. However, you may want to choose a lighter tint or offset the cool color with a neutral color, such as white. Darker cool colors, such as deep green or navy blue, can help you feel grounded in the room and give the space a cozy feeling."

          "description":"At first glance, the various shades of white and gray seem boring. In decorating, they are very useful because they fit well in any color palette. They tone down warm or light colors, but they also lighten cool or dark colors. Black, brown, and light blue are a few alternative colors that can serve as a neutral base. The key to using neutrals is to keep them as accents. Painting all of your walls white will look pretty boring until you start decorating. Whites and grays come in various tones. Be careful when using darker shades of gray, since they can make your room feel heavier or more drab. You can also balance out warm or cool paint colors by using furniture in neutral colors."

When you step into the room, your eye may go to a piece of art or another bright feature. Since you aren\u2019t focused on the exterior surfaces, rooms with light colors often feel larger than they are. Any color can be made lighter by mixing it with white. If you can\u2019t find the exact color of paint you want, try mixing your own! Include the ceiling in your considerations. A light ceiling can create the illusion that a room is taller than it is."

Painting your walls with darker colors can make your room feel smaller, cozier, and more austere. Similarly, a dark ceiling also makes a room feel smaller. Think of a library. If you designed this room in your home, you might use dark colors to create a quiet, intimate atmosphere. If you have a long, narrow hallway, paint the far walls a dark color to make the hallway feel shorter. Dark colors can also camouflage ducts and other exposed elements, but use them sparingly so they don\u2019t make your room feel too small or restrictive. You can also add a metallic glaze over any paint. This gives the paint a metallic finish, which draws attention like regular dark paint does. It can be good on painted architecture. Using a dark color on a wall can also create a strong backdrop for a focal point, such as a framed painting on the wall behind your bed or sofa."

          "description":"You can check the label on any paint you choose to see how it will affect the finish. Paints with a gloss or semi-gloss finish look a little brighter than normal. For this reason, they are often used in areas such as the kitchen. Glossy paints work best with lighter colors and are easy to renew with a new coat of paint. Satin and eggshell finishes are a little less glossy. Satin is durable and used in high-traffic areas such as a family room. Eggshell finishes are a little more delicate and can be used in low-traffic areas like your dining room. Flat or matte finishes have no shine at all. This type of paint works well with dark paint, particularly in quiet areas like bedrooms."

You may also want to find furniture and decorations that contain this color in order to emphasize a consistent color theme. Since the walls are the biggest color canvas in a room, starting there is easiest but not mandatory. If your predominant color is very bright, for example, you might buy accessories in that color, then paint your walls to complement it. Pick out colors that capture your attention.

Complementary colors create harmony, but opposing colors can accentuate your predominant color. For example, red and yellow pair well together, but you could paint your walls a light blue color to draw attention to a striking red decoration. Try looking up a color wheel to see which colors complement and contrast one another. Paint supply stores will have swatch books you can use for this purpose.

By painting them slightly lighter or darker than your primary color, you can show off these components without inhibiting the room\u2019s theme. For example, if you have gray walls, paint these components white or brown. These colors complement the gray paint without overwhelming it. Try painting these fixtures with a metallic glaze in order to slightly alter their coloring."

Use the colors in furniture, plants, art, and other components to help settle on paint colors. Blend the colors of your items with the paint you choose to create a consistent room theme. For instance, physical items can be a part of the room\u2019s theme. If you have blue and white furniture, for instance, paint your room a matching blue and white. Items can also be used as highlights through contrasting colors. If you have a vibrant, red painting, try painting the wall behind it a neutral or pale color. This draws attention to the painting instead of the wall. If your furniture and walls are the same color, your room may look dull and lifeless. Make sure to include at least a few decorations in different colors to keep things interesting."

See how the color changes throughout the day, including when you turn on lighting fixtures. This way, you can be sure you love your choices before committing to them. If you don\u2019t want to paint the sample on your wall, apply it to a primed piece of drywall. Otherwise, you can bring home paint swatches and try to use them to make a decision. Give yourself at least a day to live with your colors. The paint will look a little different from day to night, so see if it consistently appeals to you. The type of light in your room affects the paint\u2019s color. Incandescent lighting makes it seem warmer and yellower while fluorescent lighting makes it seem sharper and bluer."

Make a floor plan and take notes, remembering that even distant colors affect a room's atmosphere. For instance, if you paint your room with deep reds and browns, a bright orange hallway will detract from it. You may want to paint the hallway a pale yellow so it isn\u2019t a distraction.

Once you settle on a color scheme, you can then begin working on adjoining rooms, coming up with colors that complement it. For instance, you might start with the living room. Think about painting it a bright color to make it big and vibrant. Then, paint adjoining rooms with more subdued colors.

Try to give each room a different amount of visual weight. Mix in some darker colors, then switch back to more vibrant colors to keep your eye engaged. For example, paint your living room a vibrant red. Paint the room next to it a light yellow. Add red and brown decorations to complete the effect.

This will give your interior some visual consistency while keeping it interesting. You can use this color to choose complementary and accentuating colors that give each room a unique character. For example, say you paint your room blue with white trim. Avoid using the same shade of blue in another room. Instead, try painting the walls white and the trim a lighter blue color. Shades can help you plan out big rooms with a lot of open space. Select a main color, then find ways to apply darker shades and lighter tints. The exception is when your home has a separate upstairs and downstairs. Consider these to be different worlds. You do not need to keep them consistent with each other. It is harder to use a variety of colors across different rooms if you have a house with an open plan. If you have closed off rooms, you can use different colors more easily without creating a busy or inharmonious appearance."

You can design the rest of the colors any way you like, but let the architecture serve as a unifying feature. For example, imagine brown trim running throughout your home. The color can tie a bright red room to a subdued blue room. For instance, paint all your windows, doors, or shelves white. This can make your interior look very planned and consistent."
