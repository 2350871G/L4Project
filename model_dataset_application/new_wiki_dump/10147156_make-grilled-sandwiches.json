          "description":"One of the most integral parts of a grilled sandwich is the type of bread that you decide to use. All kinds of bread are perfectly fine for use, but some make more sense than others depending on what you will be putting inside the sandwich. If you\u2019re planning on having very few ingredients then a basic thin bread will probably work best. If you\u2019re going to be putting more ingredients in, then it may be worth exploring some heartier types of bread. Robust bread helps hold the ingredients together and also adds to the flavor of the sandwich."

          "description":"Ensure that the butter has been softened or is at least at room temperature. Trying to spread hard butter may result in you tearing the bread. Buttering the bread instead of the pan will prevent burning and ensure the bread cooks evenly. For some extra tang you can also use mayonnaise instead of butter. It will cook the same way and also add a little extra flavor to the sandwich."

          "description":"Put all the ingredients together on your bread. If you are using cheese, make sure it is a cheese that will melt (eg. Swiss, American, mozzarella). Feel free to grate the cheese onto the bread to speed up the melting process. While assembling it\u2019s important not to get too overzealous with how high you stack your sandwich. Eventually, you'll have to flip the sandwich and you don\u2019t want it to fall apart."

          "description":"To ensure that the sandwich starts cooking the moment it touches the pan, preheat it before putting the sandwich in. This should be to a medium heat where the sandwich will be able to cook gently but also thoroughly. You can always turn the temperature down later if need be."

          "headline":"Turn the temperature down to a medium-low if you can.",
          "description":"The higher the temperature, the faster the bread will cook. Therefore, once the sandwich is in and has made a nice initial sizzle, turning the temperature down by just a little bit will ensure that the bread doesn\u2019t cook too fast for the fillings. Ideal temperatures for cooking vary depending on what is in your sandwich as some fillings cook faster than others. For example, mozzarella cooks very fast so when cooking a Caprese sandwich the temperature should be higher. This will mean the bread becomes golden at the same time that the mozzarella is melted."
