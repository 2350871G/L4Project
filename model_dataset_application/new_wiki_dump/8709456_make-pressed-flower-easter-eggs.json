If you have a lot of petals, try completely covering the egg in petals. This works best for flowers with slightly bigger petals."

Place the petals back together on the egg, gluing them one at a time, to recreate your flower. You do not have to reassemble flowers if you do not want to. For a more spontaneous design, you can try placing individual petals throughout the egg's surface instead of reassembling the entire flower."
