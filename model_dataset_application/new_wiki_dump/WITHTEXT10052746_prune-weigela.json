Locate 2-3 branches that are growing next to the main stem and use a hand-held pruning saw to cut the stems upward at a 45-degree angle. Saw the stems as close to the ground as you can. This will divert the plant's energy to the main stem and new growth, which will promote stronger blooms."

Use a pair of hand shears to cut the upper growth right above a lower hanging bud on the branch. Do not cut more than 1/2 of the branches full length. Make the cut straight, right above a flowering bud. Cutting away old buds will promote the growth of new, stronger buds which will lead to more robust blooms the next year."
