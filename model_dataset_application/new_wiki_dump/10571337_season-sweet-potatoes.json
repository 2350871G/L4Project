You can do this to whole, baked sweet potatoes, or to ones that have been diced and roasted in the oven. For a single potato, use about a 1/4 teaspoon (.5 grams) each of cinnamon and nutmeg and about a 1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) of brown sugar. You could also bake the sweet potato topped with a small handful of mini marshmallows to emulate the classic holiday sweet potato casserole."
