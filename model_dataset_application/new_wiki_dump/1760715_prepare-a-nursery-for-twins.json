If you\u2019re close to anyone with older children, check with them to see if they have any useful items that are still in good shape that they wouldn\u2019t mind lending to you. Check second hand stores, garage sales or online marketplaces for lightly used items -- you never know when you might find a great deal. Consider buying items that convert or expand. A crib that converts to a toddler bed is a smart investment, for example."
