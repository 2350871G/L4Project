          "description":"Roasting frozen vegetables in a hot oven helps quickly evaporate the excess moisture caused by ice crystallization. You want them to roast, not steam in their own moisture. If your oven runs hot or tends to burn food at high temperatures, you can set it at 375 F (190 C) and increase the overall baking time."

Avoid butter or oils (like coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil) that burn easily at high temperatures. A low-sided baking sheet will keep the veggies from sliding away but allow moisture to escape more easily.

To roast thicker, starchier vegetables and thinner, softer ones at the same time, prepare them separately with the same seasonings. Then, either place them on separate baking sheets or on separate sections of a single baking sheet. This will make it easier to remove the veggies that finish roasting more quickly."

Add 1-2 more tablespoons of your chosen oil and your favorite seasonings to taste \u2014 the classic combo of salt and pepper is great here. Stir with a spoon to coat everything in the bowl, or shake and massage the veggies in the bag to coat them. The vegetables don\u2019t need to be doused in oil, just lightly coated. Start with less oil and add more as needed. Use this \u201cstart with less\u201d principle with the seasonings as well, since it\u2019s always easy to add more to taste. Consider familiar seasoning combinations like garlic salt, fennel seed, and Italian seasoning, or cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cayenne, and \u2014 after roasting \u2014 honey for a sweet and spicy twist!"

Your eyes and nose are your best guides to when the veggies are done. After 15-20 minutes, pull out the pan and take a look. Veggies that are thin (or have been cut thin) and that are less starchy may be done at this point. These include asparagus, green beans, mushrooms, and sliced bell peppers, zucchini, or tomatoes. If they look golden brown and smell delicious, they\u2019re done. You can also taste one to check."

This variation in roasting times is why it pays off to keep veggies of different thicknesses and/or starch levels separated (on one pan or multiple pans). You can scoop out each veggie type as they finish and put the rest in the oven to keep roasting."

Take regular peeks into the oven and use your nose to smell for burning, because veggies can go from perfectly roasted to over-charred quickly! You don\u2019t need to turn the vegetables again. Cauliflower, broccoli, fennel, garlic cloves, onions, snap peas, and turnips may take around 30 minutes total to roast \u2014 but times will vary, so keep checking!
