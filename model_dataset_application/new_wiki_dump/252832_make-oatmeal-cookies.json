Using an electric mixer, beat the ingredients until the mixture is fully combined and becomes light and fluffy. This should take about 3 or 4 minutes. Using softened butter should help the process along. If your butter is cold, you can  soften it by microwaving it for about 15 seconds."

You'll end up with about 2 dozen cookies, so you may need to bake them using two separate sheets or one batch at a time. If you don't have a nonstick cookie sheet, grease the cookie sheet before scooping. You can also line your cookie sheet with parchment paper. Make the cookies bigger if you'd like! Use a 1/2 cup measuring cup to scoop out giant oatmeal cookies that will be soft in the middle and crispy around the edges."
