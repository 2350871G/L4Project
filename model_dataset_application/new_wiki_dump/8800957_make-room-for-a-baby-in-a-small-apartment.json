If you are unsure about needing or wanting any of your baby supplies, set them aside for donation. Small spaces don\u2019t allow for lukewarm feelings about baby items."

          "description":"Baskets and crates are excellent for storing the many things that come along with having a little one, so round up every storage container you have. Store baby items in baskets and crates on top of dressers, bookshelves, or mounted shelves to minimize clutter and keep your space tidy. If you don\u2019t have baskets or crates, most thrift stores boast a hefty number of both. Visit your local secondhand store to find baskets and storage containers such as crates and jars that best suit your home and storage space."

Hold onto your leftover glass jars, and use them for baby bottles (mason jars have several options for nipples and sippy cups), hair bow holders, and homemade baby food jars. Baby items stack up quickly, so having a place to store all of your baby\u2019s necessities is pivotal. 4-ounce mason jars make great baby food storage jars, as do old baby food jars and small, reusable yogurt containers. If you do not have storage jars, you do not have to rush out to buy some; instead, gradually hold on to any jars you accumulate over the coming weeks and months."

Instead of purchasing a new dresser, you can set aside a drawer (or even half a drawer) of your own space to place the baby\u2019s clothing in. If you find that your baby\u2019s clothing will not fit in the dresser you already have, you can hang small shelves above the changing station to store socks, onesies, burp cloths, and other necessities."

Swaddling is ideal with square blankets, and burp rags should be soft enough to wipe a baby\u2019s delicate skin. Search through your blankets and towels to find suitable options. If you truly do not have any suitable blankets for swaddling, stick to the basics, and purchase 2-3 muslin swaddles. These can be used as swaddles, nursing covers, and floor blankets for tummy time."

This can include a crib and a changing station, along with under-crib storage containing your baby\u2019s clothing or diaper items. Nesting hits many moms in the 3rd trimester. If you do not have a dedicated nursery, setting aside a small corner will help curb nesting instincts."

While some stores will have various gadgets such as diaper warmers, these are not necessary, and will clutter up a small space. Be sure not to skip a diaper pail.

Have enough clothing to last your baby one week, in addition to special items such as warm hats, sun hats, coats, swimsuits, and mittens. While the baby aisles lining most stores would suggest otherwise, a week\u2019s worth of clothing will last your baby at least long enough to get another load in the washer. Having fewer items will mean more frequent laundering. However, more frequent laundering will likely save a lot of stress when it comes to saving space."

Having tons of clothes for each stage of your baby\u2019s life will place a large spatial burden on your home, while buying as you need to ensures you have plenty of room for your growing family. Forego newborn shoes. They are unnecessary, and take up a lot of space. Instead, purchase thick, warm socks."

This could be as simple as using a crib with drawers built in, to purchasing baby bottles that can be used as cups a few months down the road. Many baby strollers come equipped with the ability to carry car seats, then change into regular strollers as your child grows. These will cut down on space."

If possible, enlist a simple (small) umbrella stroller, high chairs designed to sit on already-existing chairs, and travel swings. Although umbrella strollers are not safe for use with newborns, you can have an umbrella stroller for 6 months and older, while using a baby carrier for the first six months. Pack\u2019N Plays can be used in the place of cribs, and some models even have a bassinet and changing table attachment included to further cut down on space."

Prepping baby tools this way allows you to take items into your home only when they are needed, and free up space the moment they are no longer necessary. When using secondhand items, make sure all screws, pins, and joints are tight and secure. Over time, screws and nails can work themselves loose and create a safety hazard."
