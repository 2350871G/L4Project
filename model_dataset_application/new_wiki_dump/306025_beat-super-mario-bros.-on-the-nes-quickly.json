Timing is of the essence to ensure clearing each jump. The third large tube is placed after a huge ravine. Land in front of the tube and slow down slightly in order to perform a \u201cclean jump\u201d. This is the only part of the game that requires you to slow down! The final tricky part of this level occurs after this jump. In order to clear a sequence of Koopa Troopas, it will be necessary to run under the first and then jump quickly to land on the single cannon while instantaneously jumping the gap immediately after it. (if you have trouble with this part, you can also take the warp tube to clear all the Koopas) The few enemies after this point can be ignored as they do not cross your path of movement.  Run up the block wall and grab the flag to end this level.  World 8-3 Jump over obstacles normally executing a clean jump over the piranha plant.  The only way to clear the Hammer Brothers without slowing down is to perform a \u201cricochet jump\u201d to kill the one on the bottom.  Next you must clear the gap/block stack/gap combination in a single jump.  At the next sighting of the Hammer Brothers, jump in between the two rows of bricks to safely run past them.  At the third sighting of these annoying reoccurring hammer brothers, jump the first hammer bro and as the next Hammer Brother is in the air jump so that you can kill him in mid jump.  When you land, immediately jump over the next tube with the plant.  At the final sighting of these persistent Hammer Brothers, you can simply jump the first and then immediately after, jump the second. Not a very challenging final attempt to stop you on their part! As soon as you land from jumping the second Hammer Brother, jump upon the stack of two blocks and then jump on the 2nd block that is in mid-air.  Finally jump to the last two which is a platform, jump down and grab the flag!  World 8-4 Jump over first monster, then, immediately jump over the next 3. (Timing your first two jumps is an important factor in avoiding the plant that emerges from the tube). After hopping over the first tube, immediately jump again to avoid the 2 Koopa Troopas.  There is no need to jump over the next 6 pits you encounter. You can simply run over them. Bypass the plant in the next tube by leaping on the tube's edge and then immediately jumping again.  The next tube can be leaped over normally.  You want to time your jump over the next tube to kill the second monster.  Save time by avoiding the next four Koopa Troopas you see.  After jumping over the first wall of blocks, immediately jump again to avoid the jumping monster.  Leap between the next two jumping monsters.  You will come to three tubes separated by chasms. The first two contain plants. You will have to leap on to the edge of the second tube, and on to the third tube without a plant. Leap off of the third tube to avoid four monsters.  You will come to another chasm. Carefully time your jump to land on the piece of land in the middle. Timing is even more key while performing the next jump you come to.  Be careful to avoid falling into the pits. ",
