Press down on your creases to keep the front legs in place. Fold the back legs up. Fold the paper up on a diagonal valley fold to create the back legs. Fold the paper up so the inside edges meet up with the horizontal crease that makes up the bottom of the shell. Press down with your finger to crease. Fold the tail up. fold up the bottom triangle, which is the tail, making a valley fold. Bring the tip of the triangle up to fit in the space between the legs.
