  "text":" Canning Peas with a Pressure Canner Using the Raw Pack Method Prepare the peas for canning. Select ripe, bright green peas with young, tender, sweet seeds. Shell and wash the peas under cool running water, and discard or compost the pods. Clean 9 glass pint (500mL) canning jars and metal lids with soap and hot water. Keep the jars and lids hot until they are ready to be filled. Jars and lids can be kept hot by placing them upside down in a pot of hot water or by washing them in a dishwasher and keeping them in the dishwasher until needed. Fill the clean jars with the washed peas leaving 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space at the top of the jars. Add one tsp. (5 mL) of canning salt to each jar (optional), then fill jars with boiling water, while keeping 1 inch (2.5 cm) of air space at the top of the jars. Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean cloth, shake gently to allow air bubbles to escape and cover with the metal lids. Place the sealed jars on the rack in the pressure canner filled with 3 quarts (2.8 L) of hot water. The jars must not sit directly on the bottom of the canner, and should not touch each other to allow steam to flow freely around them. Place the cover securely on the canner and heat water to boiling. Allow steam to vent from the canner for 10 minutes before adding canner weights or closing vents. After 10 minutes close vents or put on weights (depending on the type of pressure canner you are using) and allow the pressure to build. Process jars in the pressure canner for 40 minutes, adjusting the pressure based on your altitude (see guide below). Start timing when the necessary pressure is reached. Check the gauge frequently to ensure the pressure remains constant. For dial gauge canners, set pressure to 11 PSI (75.8 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 2000 feet (0 to 610 m), 12 PSI (82.7 kPa) for altitudes of 2001 to 4000 feet (610 to 1220 m), 13 PSI (89.6 kPa) for altitudes of 4001 to 6000 feet (1220 to 1830 m), and 14 PSI (96.5 kPa) for 6001 to 8000 feet (1830 to 2440 m).

Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter and place them on a wooden board or thick kitchen towel to allow them to cool in a draft free area. Keep 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space between jars to allow air to circulate.

Label the jars with ingredients and the date, then store in a cool, dark and dry location.  Canning Peas with a Pressure Canner Using the Hot Pack Method Prepare the peas for canning. Select ripe, bright green peas with young, tender, sweet seeds. Shell and wash the peas under cool running water, and discard or compost the pods. Pour peas into a large stockpot and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil and cook peas for 2 to 3 minutes. Avoid overcooking the peas to keep them from becoming too mushy.
