You then push the vacuum around the surface of the pool with a pole to suck up dirt and debris. A good hand vacuum of the pool will take 1 to 1.5 hours. Get in the habit of cleaning the pool at least 2 times a week, especially if your pool is outdoors and uncovered."

Get in the habit of cleaning the generator cell in the pool so it is not clogged and can work properly. Use a high pressure hose to blast off the build up on the cell. You can also scrape off salt build up with a wooden or plastic tool. If the build up is really stubborn and hard to get off, you can soak the cell in 4 parts water and 1 part muriatic acid. Allow the cell to soak for a few minutes and then rinse it off with water."

If you have an outdoor pool, make sure the stabilizer levels are at 70-80 ppm. If you have an indoor pool, you should have stabilizer levels at 0-30 ppm. You can lower the stabilizer levels by draining the pool and adding fresh water to dilute the pool water. You can raise the stabilizer levels by adding cyanuric acid to the pool water, based on the manufacturer's instructions."

You can bump up the alkalinity level by adding baking soda to the water and reduce it by adding muriatic acid. The calcium in the water helps to prevent the water from becoming corrosive and cloudy. It should be at 200-400 ppm. You can add calcium to the pool to bump up the calcium level and reduce the amount you add to bring the calcium level down. The salt level should be in the range specified by the manufacturer of the pool. This is usually around 2700-4500 ppm. You can add more salt to the water to bump up the salt level to where it should be. Always make sure the cell in your pool is working so the salt can circulate properly."
