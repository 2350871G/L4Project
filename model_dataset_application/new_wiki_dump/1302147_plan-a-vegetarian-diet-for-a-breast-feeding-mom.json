          "description":"Just like when you are pregnant, you are eating for two when you are breastfeeding. It's very important that breastfeeding moms make sure to consume enough calories \u2014 in fact, you will need to consume more calories than you did when you were pregnant. Your body will be burning extra calories when you breastfeed, so take that into account when planning your meals. Typically, women will need an additional 400 \u2013 500 calories per day during the first six months of breastfeeding. This is useful for losing pregnancy weight, but it means you need to account for the loss of calories when planning your diet. During the second six months of breastfeeding, you will likely burn about 400 additional calories per day."

          "description":"When you are breastfeeding, it's not enough to just eat more calories \u2014 \"empty\" calories, or those that provide no nutritional value, should be avoided. You need to make sure that you are choosing nutrient-rich foods. You and your baby need specific nutrients in your diet to keep you both healthy. It is important to get enough protein. Sometimes, this can pose the greatest challenge for vegetarians. Aim to get about 89 grams per day. High protein foods include beans, nuts, and eggs (which many vegetarians don't eat). You also need to make sure to eat plenty of Vitamin B12. You can get your daily 26 mcgs by drinking milk or fortified soy milk. You can also find it in fortified cereals and yogurt. Breastfeeding moms need about 1,000 mgs per day of calcium. Eat vegetarian dairy products, fortified orange juice, dark leafy greens, and almonds. You can get Vitamin D from these sources, too. Empty calories include things like cakes, cookies, pastries, soda, ice cream, bacon, hot dogs, and pizza."

Water is the best choice, but you can supplement that with low-sugar juices and soups. Make sure to limit your caffeine intake while breastfeeding. Opt for caffeine free green tea instead. Low fat milk is also a great choice to help you stay hydrated."

In fact, the Mayo Clinic recommends that all women of child bearing-age take a prenatal vitamin, even if they are not planning to become pregnant. Your doctor may also suggest additional supplements. One of the most common supplements for breastfeeding mom is Vitamin B-12. This nutrient is key to your baby's development, and is found almost exclusively in animal products. Your doctor might also recommend a Vitamin D supplement. This is especially common if you are not able to get enough natural sunlight. Your baby needs Vitamin D to help him absorb calcium. A Vitamin D deficiency can cause rickets, which is a weakening of the bones."

When you have a new baby, you'll want to focus your energy on the baby, and not spend the day thinking about getting enough nutrients. Set aside some time at the beginning of each week to plan your meals. The government offers a very useful checklist that you can rely on.

This means that you need to make sure to eat several smaller meals to ensure that you are getting enough calories for you and your baby each day. Try to eat three regularly sized meals and three between meal snacks per day. Even if you are at home with your baby, try packing a lunch as if you were going to work. Then you will have a meal you can just grab and eat as needed. Have plenty of snacks prepared. The ones you can eat with one hand are best, so that you can still care for your baby as needed. Keep a supply of nuts, fruits, yogurt, and cheese handy."

          "description":"You may be planning to breastfeed for several months, so you will be carefully monitoring your food intake for a while. To keep yourself from growing bored with traditional vegetarian fare, try out some new foods. Once you have spent some time learning about the best foods to eat, you'll feel more comfortable experimenting. Make use of lentils. Lentils are an excellent source of protein, but often overlooked. You can make a wide variety of lentil soups, casseroles, and veggie burgers. Bonus: lentils are very inexpensive and will keep in your pantry for a long time. Try dried fruits. Although fresh fruits are delicious, even our favorite things can grow tiresome. Try switching up your routine by adding some dried fruits, such as mangoes, to your meals. You can even add them to salads. Experiment with meat substitutes. Most vegetarians are probably familiar with tofu and tempeh. In addition to these great products, grocery stores are adding more meat substitutes each day. Try some vegan gyro \"meat\" to add some variety. Eat nutrient-dense foods, such as avocado, beans, and full-fat soy milk."

Being able to refer back to your ideas will help you to make sure you have the time and ingredients that you need. You'll also probably gain some peace of mind by planning out your menus in advance. For example, try muffins for breakfast. You can make a whole batch of these single serve meals and freeze them. In a muffin tin, combine eggs (if your vegetarian diet permits you to eat them) and any vegetables you like (think spinach, onions, tomatoes). Add some shredded cheese for extra protein and bake until no longer runny. Wrap in foil and place in a freezer bag. In the morning, just pop one in the microwave for 1 minute and enjoy with one hand. Lunch can be a challenge. Make burritos or wraps your friend. For example, wrap a whole-wheat tortilla around black beans, cheese, spinach, and salsa. You can make this any time throughout the day (or a day or two ahead) and keep in the fridge. Then, just heat and eat whenever you're ready. For dinner, eat vegetarian lasagna. You can pack this with veggies, and low-fat cheese is a great source of protein. Make ahead of time, freeze, and heat single-servings as necessary. Snacks are a necessity.

If you have a list ready, you'll be able to easily let your friends and family help you out by doing the shopping for you. Try planning only two options for breakfasts, two for lunch, and two for dinner. This will get you through the week, but cut down on the amount of ingredients you need to buy. A full fridge will help ease your stress, so buy more than you think you might need at first. You'll find that with a new baby, it's much harder to pop out to the store if you need something."
