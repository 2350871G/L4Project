          "description":"Cottage cheese has a salty and creamy flavor that\u2019s similar to mayo. Cottage cheese is low calorie, high protein, and has no cholesterol. It works especially well in tuna or pasta salad recipes. Make a healthy dip by mixing red peppers, fresh herbs, lemon juice, and cottage cheese. Adjust the proportions of each ingredient according to your taste."

          "headline":"Replace mayo with hummus.",
          "description":"Hummus can be spread on sandwiches in place of mayo. It can also be mixed into cold-salad recipes, like egg salad, as a mayo replacement. Hummus has fewer calories, more fiber, and more protein than mayo. Add a few olives and capers to a tuna salad sandwich that\u2019s been made with hummus instead of mayo to create a Mediterranean treat."

        {
          "headline":"Use olive oil in place of mayo.",
          "description":"A fine drizzling of olive oil will coat food in a smooth texture similar to mayo. Olive oil is a useful mayo substitute in slaws and salads. Avoid overusing this substitute, as it can be somewhat calorie heavy."

          "headline":"Substitute plain Greek yogurt for mayo.",
          "description":"Greek yogurt is loaded with protein and calcium while being relatively calorie-light. Its creaminess and tartness make it a versatile substitute. Yogurt spreads easily on sandwiches, but you can also mix it into salads and pasta dishes. You can impart a savory flavor to yogurt by seasoning it with herbs and spices. Sweet dressings can be imitated by adding honey to yogurt."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use runny or boiled eggs instead of mayo.",
          "description":"Runny eggs can be used as a sandwich spread or as a sauce for cold salads. Alternatively, use sliced hard boiled eggs. They won\u2019t have the same creamy quality as mayo, but the smoothness of the egg will be similar to mayo. Eggs are high in vitamins, minerals, and protein, unlike mayo."

          "description":"Pesto is loaded with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. You can make pesto at home or purchase it from the store. Add it to sandwiches as a spread, to salads as a dressing, and pasta dishes as a sauce. Replace the mayo usually used in potato salad with pesto for an interesting and healthier take on this common dish."

          "headline":"Use mashed avocado as a mayo substitute.",
          "description":"Peel and pit your avocado, then mash it up in a mixing bowl with a fork. When it reaches paste consistency, add a little salt, pepper, and lime juice to taste. After that, it\u2019s ready to be spread on a sandwich, mixed in with a salad, or more. Mashed avocado is a great mayo substitute you can use to make a healthier version of egg salad. Feel free to add to your mashed avocado. You might find it tastes even better with some chopped peppers and onions."

          "headline":"Emphasize creaminess by switching mayo with almond butter.",
          "description":"Be careful when subbing almond butter. It has about the same number of calories, but almond butter also is rich in protein, vitamin E, and fiber. When a recipe only calls for a little mayo, try almond butter instead."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Sub mustard for mayo.",
          "description":"Excluding honey mustard, this condiment is a very low-calorie alternative. Additionally, there are many varieties of mustard that you can use to keep its flavor fresh and dynamic. Mustard and a little cottage cheese, for example, could result in an interesting sauce for a cold-salad recipe or slaw. Mustard tends to be a little on the high side where sodium is concerned. Keep this in mind if you\u2019re on a sodium restricted diet."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try soy-based mayo.",
          "description":"The most common brand, Nayonaise, has half the calories as regular mayo and is rich in vitamin B13 and omega-3 fatty acids. The consistency and flavor of soy-based mayo is just like normal mayo, so feel free to use these products exactly as you would normally."
