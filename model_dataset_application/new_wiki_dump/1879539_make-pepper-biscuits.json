Cutting the butter into small pieces instead of melting it will make your biscuits fluffy as opposed to dense. Try to use cold as opposed to room temperature butter. Cold butter makes the best biscuits because when the butter melts in the oven, it separates the flour into \u201clayers\u201d, which makes the biscuit tender and flaky."

When you have finished adding the butter, pulse once more to make sure that the ingredients are blended. The mixture should look coarse but blended. Some chunks of butter are ok.\nDon\u2019t over-mix in the food processor, as this can heat up and melt the butter. If you don\u2019t have a food processor, use a sharp knife to dice the butter into smaller chunks, then add the butter and hand stir the mixture."

Baking and Serving the Biscuits Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Cover a large baking sheet with parchment paper, then arrange the biscuits on top.
