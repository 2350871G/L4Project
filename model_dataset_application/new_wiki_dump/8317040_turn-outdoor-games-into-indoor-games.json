          "description":"Harder balls, like baseballs, can be replaced with softer variations to prevent damage to the things inside your house. Consider replacing hard balls with balls that would be safer for indoor play, such as beach balls, balloons, or bean bags. Many toy companies sell softer, lighter variations of outdoor balls marketed towards younger children. Even a crinkled piece of paper can double as a makeshift basketball."

Instead of drawing the grid on the blacktop with chalk, use painters tape to draw a grid on hardwood or tiled floors. Once the kids are done playing, you can remove the tape, and it will be like it was never there."

          "description":"Furniture can represent different things if you use your imagination. For instance, if you're playing soccer inside, you can clear out a room and use two pieces of furniture to represent goal posts. Likewise, two chairs can become the goal posts for a game of nerf football. Think of other things that you can do with the items laying around in your house. Be very careful when incorporating things into your indoor play. Don't pick anything that can easily get knocked over or shatter. A trash bin can become a basketball hoop. Furniture can become cover in a nerf gun fight."

It's important that the children stick to the rules. If the children don't want to follow the rules, their safety is at risk and you should tell them that they can't play anymore. Good rules include only using the designated room, sticking to the designating play items, and a restriction on running in the house. You can say something like \"I set up the basement for playing. Do not go into the side room and follow the rules that we talked about. If you don't want to follow the rules, I won't allow you to play anymore, and I'll take away the basketball hoop.\" Don't make exceptions or bend the rules or else you children will try to push their limits in the future."

If you aren't going to be home, make sure to leave them a list of emergency numbers in case something goes wrong. Communicate with the kids via text if you aren't going to be home. It may be easier to do this unless there is an emergency. If you aren't going to be home, make sure that there is a neighbor that can help your kids in emergency situations."
