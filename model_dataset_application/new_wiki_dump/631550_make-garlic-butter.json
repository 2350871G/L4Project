Garlic-in-oil is best used immediately, but unused portions must be refrigerated, and should be used within a week to prevent botulism. Garlic butter can be spread on bread, toast, corn on the cob, burgers, or anything else.

Skim off the foamy layer with a spoon. What's left in the pan will be a liquid layer of butterfat in the middle, and the separated milk solids on the bottom. Continue heating on low until the milk solids begin to turn a light brown. Remove from the heat. Gently pour out the liquid into a separate sauce pan, being sure the leave the milk solids in the bottom of the sauce pan. If you have a strainer and cheesecloth, strain the liquid butterfat into the new sauce pan. Discard the milk solids, or keep them to add into gravy, mashed potatoes, or other recipes."
