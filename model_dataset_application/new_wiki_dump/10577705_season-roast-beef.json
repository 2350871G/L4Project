While it\u2019s preheating, use a fork to stir the following spices together in a small bowl:\n0.5 tsp (2.5 g) kosher salt\n0.5 tsp (2.5 g) garlic powder\n0.25 tsp (1.25 g) black pepper\nIf you like your roast more heavily seasoned, you can increase each of these amounts by 0.25 tsp (2.5 g)."

          "description":"Use your thumb and fingertips to sprinkle the seasoning blend evenly over all sides of the roast. Lightly pat the roast with your hand to help adhere the seasoning to it. Don\u2019t try to save time by just seasoning the top of the roast. Adding seasoning to all sides will give the roast a more consistent flavor."

          "headline":"Tie up the roast with cooking twine, if necessary.",
          "description":"Many butcher shops will tie up a roast for you upon request. If you\u2019re tying it yourself, double-knot lengths of cooking twine around the roast at 3 in (7.6 cm) intervals. The goal of tying is to give the roast a consistent shape and thickness. Aim to give the roast a roughly cylindrical shape when you tie it up. But don\u2019t worry if it isn\u2019t perfect! Use cotton twine specifically intended for cooking."

          "description":"For many cooks, the rule of thumb for roast beef is to cook it for 20 minutes per 1 lb (0.45 kg). Since this is a 3 lb (1.4 kg) roast, plan for an hour of cooking time. If you choose to check the temperature with a probe thermometer while cooking, remove the roast from the oven when the internal temperature reaches 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C). The temperature will increase to the recommended 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) internal temperature while the roast rests."

          "description":"With the roast still in the pan, loosely cover it with one or more sheets of aluminum foil. During this 15-20 minute resting period, the internal temperature will rise to 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) and the meat\u2019s juices will redistribute more evenly. If you cut into the roast right away, more of the juices will run out, leaving the meat with a dry texture. It also may not have reached the recommended internal temperature."
