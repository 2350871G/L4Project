A cup or two of water. Newspapers torn into long, narrow strips. A good size to aim for is 2 to 3 inches wide and 6 to 7 inches long per strip. Paint brushes. Paint or markers to color the planets. In order to make the planets as realistic as possible you'll need all your basic colors handy: orange, yellow, blue, brown, green, red, gray, and white. At least a dozen balloons, in case you need a few extra. Ingredients for adhesive: you can use either white craft glue or flour and water. Material for planet rings. Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune all have rings. You'll need a thin flexible wire or pipe cleaner to form rings, or you can just use construction paper."

          "description":"There are two easy ways to make an adhesive that you'll use to apply the newspaper strips to the balloons. You can either use a white craft glue base or a white flour base. If you want to use glue, you can buy any basic white glue. Mix two parts glue to one part water in a bowl. You'll need several cups to make the entire set of planets. If you don't have glue readily available, you can grab some white flour from your cupboard. Mix one part flour to one part water in a bowl. Make about two cups. You'll want a consistency that resembles the thickness of glue, but not so thick that it does not spread easily over your newspaper strips. If it is too thick add more water. If it is too watery, add some more glue or flour."

Although you may not be able to get the scale exact, it will be useful for educational purposes to blow up the balloons so that their relative size matches the planets they represent. The biggest balloon will be the Sun, which is approximately ten times the largest planet Jupiter. For sake of scale, each planet can be roughly compared to the following objects:\nMercury \u2014 marble\nVenus \u2014 walnut\nEarth \u2014 golf ball\nMars \u2014 acorn\nJupiter \u2014 basketball\nSaturn \u2014 soccer ball\nUranus \u2014 soft ball\nNeptune \u2014 small grapefruit\nPluto \u2014 kidney bean"

The process of making it is simple, but will almost certainly get messy. You will be dipping newspaper strips in your adhesive mixture and applying it to an object, in this case a balloon. Once the strips dry, you'll be left with hardened objects that will represent the planets. Tear the newspaper into long, thin strips. Use one strip at a time and get rid of excess adhesive from each strip over the bowl by running your fingers lightly over it. This will conserve your mixture but also make sure your planets are not too soggy."

Balloons have a tend to wander if not held in place. If you have an extra pair of hands, have one person hold the balloon while the other applies the strips. Otherwise, you can put the balloon in a large bowl that will keep it in place or nestle it between two weighted objects, like some books. In order to cover the tie end of the balloon, tape it down and then place a strip directly over the end. Make sure there are no gaps between the strips. You want to cover the balloon completely. Use your paintbrush to smooth the surface and get rid of excess glue from the newspaper strips. It's okay to leave some texture to the final product as this will make the balloons appear more realistic to the topography of a planet."

It would be best if you have a drying rack, or an enclosed protected space to prevent the balloons from rolling around.

You'll want the hole to be on the side of the balloon and somewhat centered to make it as much like the real placement of the rings as possible. Put the wire through the hole and close the end to anchor it. Then form a circle around each ringed planet with the wire long enough to stretch the entire diameter. The wire will support itself and will simply need to be bent around each planet. If you do not have wire, you can use construction paper. Cut the construction paper 2 to 3 inches wide and long enough to make it around the entire balloon. Glue the construction paper ring around each planet."

You can also tie each planet to something simple like coat hangers that can be hung around the room, or make a wooden dowel that planets can be hung from. The sun should be the first balloon, followed by each planet in order. The string should hang the planets low enough that they are visible to each child and readily able to be interacted with. Since it will be difficult to replicate the exact scale of each planet's distance from the sun, you should make them far enough apart to be clearly distinguished from one another. A good distance to shoot for would be 2 to 3 feet apart if you have plenty of space, otherwise use your space the best way you see fit."
