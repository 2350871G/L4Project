Think of the bones like mini ice cubes, staying cold for much longer than the meat, and you'll see why letting the whole thing warm up a bit before cooking is so important. Continue with the dry rub and prep work while they warm up -- you just don't want to put the ribs in the oven before 30-60 minutes."
