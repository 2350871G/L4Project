      "description":"Oil drums are explosive. They burst when hit, spreading fire on the ground near it. Any Worm caught in the explosion and in the resulting fire will have its health or life bar decreased. You can use oil drums to generate more damage against your target Worms by hitting them on your move. Be careful not to leave your Worms unattended near oil drums to avoid a similar fate."

It can explode immediately when triggered, or it can take up to three seconds. A mine can also be used as a weapon, which you can drop beside an enemy Worm to blow him out. Avoid mines at all cost when moving your Worms."
