If unsure, too little bleach is preferable to too much, as you don't want it eating through the fabric of your jacket. Mix the liquid well, and remember to always wear gloves when handling bleach. Low-splash bleach is recommended for tidiness."

If further fading is required, leave for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat the process as necessary. Be sure to smooth out all folds, such as the collar. If bleach does not reach the entire surface of the jacket the result will be uneven. If a 'tie dye' look is desired, elastic bands can be used to protect certain areas from bleaching. If your jacket's thread colour is beginning to bleed into the fabric, this is a sign that it has been soaking for too long."
