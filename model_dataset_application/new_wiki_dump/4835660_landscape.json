List the things you really want to include in your yard or things that you need to repair and look around to see how much they cost. Aim to save between $5,000-$10,000 USD or 10% of your home\u2019s value or to put towards your landscaping. Work on landscaping a little bit at a time if you don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money at once. Consider reusing some of the plants or objects already in your yard to cut the costs of your project. Save an additional 10% to your expected costs in case something demands more budget."

          "description":"Make each square on your graph paper equal to 1 square foot (0.093 m). Draw the shape of your yard as accurately as you can. Use a pencil to mark squares and circles for where you want to put plants or fixtures. Keep in mind where the sun is throughout the day and where any utility lines run so you can plan plants around them. Look for a landscape design program on your computer to work on your landscape digitally. Good free programs to use include Home Outside, Gardena, and Marshalls Garden Visualiser. Visit your local landscaping store to see what you want to include in your yard. Look on Pinterest or other online sources for more ideas on how to landscape your yard."

Incorporate squares and rectangles into your design, such as a long straight path leading to an open rectangular patio. Pick out plants that are easy to prune so you can easily change their shape, like boxwoods, cedars, or succulents. Contemporary landscapes require a lot of plant care so they are controlled and confined to their area."

If you want to include paths or patios, use stones or gravel in curved lines to draw more attention to your plants. Include simple features, like bird baths or small stone structures, to add more visual interest. Let areas of your yard run wild if you want minimal upkeep in your yard."

Place your berms in corners of your yard or along one of your plot lines. Make a pile of soil so that\u2019s 5 times as long as it is tall to form your berm. Pat it down on top with a shovel and plant any vegetation you want before covering the berm in 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of mulch. Avoid putting berms near your home so runoff water doesn\u2019t pool against the structure."

Choose a place in your yard where your tree will fit once it\u2019s reached its full size. Pick up a young tree from your local nursery so it\u2019s easier to transport and plant. Dig a hole slightly wider and deeper than the tree\u2019s root system and put your tree in the ground. Water the tree every day for the first 3-4 weeks so it can establish roots. Tie the tree trunk to stakes to help it grow straight and prevent wind from blowing it over. Choose evergreen trees if you want shade in your yard throughout the entire year. Pick deciduous trees that lose their leaves yearly if you just need shade in the summer."

After measuring your yard and determining how much sod you need, lay it down along the edges of your yard first. Work in a brick-like pattern until your entire yard is covered. You may need to cut pieces of sod to fit around curves or obstacles already present in your yard. Look at the nearest landscaping store to see what types of grasses they offer."

If you want a more relaxing space, choose plants with cool colors, like blue, white, and pink. Make sure to choose similarly colored plants for your entire yard so it\u2019s completely cohesive. For example, you may plant sunflowers, zinnias, and petunias to create a warm color scheme."

That way, all you have to do is plant them in your yard and provide minimal watering and upkeep. If you\u2019re working on a budget, native plants tend to be cheaper to maintain than other plants. For example, if you live in a hot, arid climate, avoid planting anything that requires a lot of water. Instead, look for succulents or cacti for your yard. Native plants require less watering since they\u2019re already used to their climate."

Put plants with different leaf shapes next to one another so they contrast and stand out. Even if they have different leaf shapes and textures, avoid putting plants that are the same color next to one another. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to easily tell them apart. For example, you may put lamb\u2019s ear, which has smooth round leaves, next to more textured plants like ferns, that have large, textured leaves."

Once you have an idea of what you want to do, build the shape of your patio with bricks, pavers, or concrete. Keep an outdoor-safe table on your patio if you want an exterior dining space.

Put the lights around pathways so guests can see where they\u2019re walking or use floodlights to illuminate a prominent piece of your landscaping, such as a sculpture or large plant.

Use wooden panel fences that are about 6 feet (1.8 m) tall so it\u2019s not easy for others to look or climb over. Hedges are tall shrubs that make great natural barriers between your and your neighbor\u2019s yard. Check with your city to see if you can build a fence in your neighborhood."

Set the base on top of your packed stone dust and use a level to make sure it sits flat. Feed the pump line through the fountain and fill the fountain with water.

As you build your walls up, fill in the back side with rocks, gravel, or another well-draining medium. Plant shrubs and flowers in the area closed off by your wall to make your plants seem taller."
