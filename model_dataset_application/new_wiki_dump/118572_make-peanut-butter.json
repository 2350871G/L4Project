          "description":"Before you use your peanuts to make peanut butter, you should rinse them under cool water to get rid of any excess dirt. You can then pat them dry. If they're unshelled, then you should shell them by hand, which is a bit easier when they're dry; they don't have to be perfectly shelled, either. Spanish peanuts are a good choice for peanut butter due to the high oil content."

          "description":"Some people prefer to roast their peanuts before processing them, to give them that additional crispy, crunchy flavor. However, this is completely optional and does make the process take quite a bit longer, so it's up to you to decide whether or not you want to roast them; you can also buy pre-toasted peanuts. If you do decide to roast them, however, then here is what you'll need to do:\nPlace the peanuts in a bowl and lightly toss them with the peanut or vegetable oil. Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (176\u00b0C). Spread the peanuts on a single layer on a baking pan. You want to make sure they aren't on top of each other so they are fairly evenly cooked. Cook them for about 10 minutes, until they're lightly covered in oil and are golden brown. If you'd like, you can gently shake the pan they're in every 2 minutes or so to take extra precautions against burning."

At least 3 minutes of processing should do the trick. Just remember that this peanut butter will never look as creamy as the kind you may be used to from Jiffy. That's because it's more natural.
