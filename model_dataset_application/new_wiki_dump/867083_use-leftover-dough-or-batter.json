          "description":"Refrigerate any extra batter or dough, covered with plastic, for up to a day. You won't want to use batter that is older than 24 hours. Most batter contains milk and eggs, which can spoil quickly if not used. Batter will also lose its leavening if its left too long. Baking powder and baking soda will lose their efficacy once they are wet. Check to see if it is spoiled or has a smell before using it. Warm up the batter before using. You can get it to slightly cooler than room temperature."
