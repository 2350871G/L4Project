Find out in advance and save yourself the worry. If their diet is so unusual for you that you're unsure what to do, consider asking them to bring along something that you can prepare along with everything else, or to provide you with the ingredients or a recipe in advance.

      "description":"Avoid making a menu that requires everything to be prepared and served immediately, or you will never leave the kitchen. This might be fine for restaurants with hordes of helpers but you (and possibly your partner) are it when holding a dinner party at home, so keep in mind that dishes which can be prepared in advance are a blessing. Desserts that can be made the day ahead are ideal (for example, ice cream, dessert pies, flans, mousse, etc. ), as are elements of the main course that can be prepared hours earlier and simply reheated. In recipe books, look for the notation \"can be prepared 'X hours' in advance\"."

      "headline":"Dress up simple to make it elegant.",
      "description":"Instead of going over the top with food, go over the top with the presentation. Place a simple stewed fruit dessert into a glorious container, such as a pretty china teacup. The teacup will do all the hard work for you and the dessert will be enjoyed just as an elegant dessert because it's \"dressed up\"."

      "headline":"Make space.",
      "description":"There is nothing harder than preparing a dinner party in a small space where everything and everyone is underfoot. Here are some things to consider:\nGet pets out of the way. A meandering cat or over-enthusiastic dog can be a real pest when working fast in a kitchen! Ask children to keep kitchen visits to a minimum. It's a good idea to have meals for children prepared in advance and heated quickly if they're not actually participating in the dinner party. Have them eat off trays in the TV room or outdoors to keep the dining area tidy and clean. Clear out the fridge in advance. This will ensure that you have plenty of space to put food in that has been made or purchased specifically for the dinner party. Clean out the oven. Do this well in advance and ensure that all the oven shelves are placed at the right level before heating it for food cooking. Clear away anything extrinsic to preparation on benches, kitchen table, etc. As you work on each part of the meal, put away the ingredients and wash used bowls, utensils, etc. so that space isn't taken up and you have items for using for the next stage of cooking."

      "headline":"Make a good first impression.",
      "description":"Provided you greet everyone happily, and the place looks ready and buzzing with anticipation when your guests arrive, they'll fail to notice little mistakes during the rest of the night. Remember that most people are very supportive and very forgiving."

If you are concerned about forgetting to do things during the occasion, write a list and pin it somewhere obvious. This can be your source of guidance if you forget what needs doing next. Cross off items already done if wished."
