First, wind the ribbon around the center of the balloon, over the dip in the balloon. Tie a strong knot to keep in place. This ribbon is essential for hanging the pinata. You can also attach two regular balloons until you got the shape of a heart."

Apply layer two and let it dry too. On average, each layer will need about 12 hours drying time. Continue with a further two layers, drying each layer in between."
