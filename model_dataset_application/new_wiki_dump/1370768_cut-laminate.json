Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to all sides, just in case chipping or splitting occurs when you make your cuts. You will need to buy 5% to 10% more material than what your measurements dictate to account for waste and mistakes. The standard measurement for laminate stock sheets is 48 by 96 inches (1.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m). For detailed instructions on measuring for the floor, read How to Measure the Floor for Laminate. Purchase the number of laminate sheets you\u2019ll need for the job at any hardware store."

Bring your purchased laminate sheets inside your home and lay them down for about 72 hours before you plan to begin the job. Open the boxes and allow the laminate time to acclimate to the humidity level before you start making cuts. If you don\u2019t allow the sheets a chance to acclimate, you could end up with laminate that pulls apart or buckles after you\u2019ve installed it."

          "headline":"Choose a cutting tool.",
          "description":"There are many efficient cutting tools used for laminate, but no matter which one you choose, the blade needs to be extremely sharp and thin. In general, the thinner the blade, the less likely it will be to cause splits or chips in the laminate. Your options for cutting tools are table saws, circular saws, jigsaws, miter saws, and hand saws. Table saws, circular saws, and jigsaws are usually the favored options. If you choose a jigsaw as your tool, be sure to get special laminate cutting blades to go with it. These blades are quite cheap \u2013 they will be efficient to use for one job, but you\u2019ll need to throw them out after that. If you plan to be cutting a lot of laminate flooring, consider purchasing or renting a laminate floor cutter at a hardware store. These are easy to use, create no noise and generate no toxic laminate dust."

          "headline":"Gather the other necessary tools.",
          "description":"Aside from cutting tools, you will also need a dust mask, safety glasses, a tape measure and a non-permanent fine-tipped marker for this job. Do not skip the protective glasses and dust mask. The dust generated from cutting laminate is known to cause cancer and other health issues, so you definitely need to avoid breathing it in or getting it into your eyes. If you will be cutting a lot of irregular or curved shapes, consider investing in a forge profile gauge. This tool will make it very easy for you to accurately mark curved lines onto the laminate before you start making the cuts."

Be sure to mark the lines on the finished side of the laminate. You can easily remove non-permanent ink from the laminate with a damp cloth as long as you do so fairly quickly after you make your cuts. Many people opt to use a wax pencil for marking lines onto laminate, but the wax lines can get dull and difficult to see quickly."

Use your cutting tool to carefully saw along the line you\u2019ve just measured and marked. After you make the cut, use a damp cloth to wipe away any remaining ink from the laminate\u2019s surface. Be careful when you handle newly cut laminate. After you make the cut, the edge will be extremely sharp. When using a circular saw, use a fine 140-tooth plywood blade to make an accurate cut without damaging the finish. Because the edges are so sharp, you may want to wear protective gloves when you're handling cut laminate. Keep your safety goggles and dust mask on at all times. Place a bucket beneath your cutting table, so the majority of laminate dust falls into it while you're sawing. Frequently bag up this debris and throw it away."
