          "description":"The first step to eliminating dog odor from your carpet is to vacuum it thoroughly. Pet dander and hair can easily get embedded in carpet fibers, leaving a lingering smell. Use a full sized vacuum for larger carpeted areas, or a handheld vacuum for throw rugs and small mats. If you don\u2019t own a large vacuum cleaner, rent a wet/dry vacuum from a local hardware store. Use the vacuum hose attachment to get into hard-to-reach corners and under furniture."

          "description":"Baking soda is a perfect tool for neutralizing odors that may be stuck in your carpet fibers. Sprinkle a layer of baking soda over your entire carpet. Let it sit there for 2-3 hours to absorb the smell. If the dog odor is concentrated in one area of the carpet, sprinkle baking soda in that area only to focus your cleaning. Be sure to keep pets away from this area while the baking soda sets in. It is not toxic to dogs but it can be harmful if ingested in large quantities.

The heat from the steam may cause the urine protein to bind into the carpet fibers, making it even more difficult to remove.
