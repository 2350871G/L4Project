          "description":"If you've caught the stain at an early point, you're in luck. Paint stains become much harder to clean if they're allowed to dry. Water-based paints like spray paint may be reduced considerable by putting it in the sink and blotting up the paint with a paper towel. When one area of paper towel has been blotted up quickly move to a new area of towel to keep the blotting going. Blotting is important to do before you get to any rubbing. If you rub before you blot, the paint will just get pushed deeper into the fabric, spreading it around."

          "description":"Wet paint can be targeted swiftly with the right kind of applicable stain remover. The type of stain remover you use will depend on the type of spray paint it is. Consult the can and check if you're still unsure. Water-based paint can be eased out with a dab of dish soap and some committed scrubbing. Turpentine, WD-40 or even hairspray can be used to treat oil-based stains. However, spray paint tends to be acrylic, so it should be approached as a water-based paint while it's still wet."

          "description":"With the right spray in place, the chemicals can do their work. It's up to you to make sure they get around. Rubbing a dry cloth up against the affected area will give the paint somewhere to soak up into. Continue rubbing the area, and don't be afraid to get rough with your rubbing. If one area of your cloth gets too saturated, move onto the next. It is obviously preferable that the dry cloth in question isn't one that you would care much if it got discoloured. Repeat the process until you've removed as much paint as you're reasonably going to. Don't be surprised if you're not able to get all of it out. Every smidgen of paint soaked out makes the existing stain less apparent."

All the same, you can get a surprising amount of it removed without any chemicals or fluid. Taking a butter knife or your fingernail, scrape the excess paint away from the stain. Because the paint has dried, it will actually come off in chunks.

          "description":"Alcohol-based cleaners, like acetone nail polish remover or hairspray, are arguably your best bet for fighting acrylic-based spray paint stains. These cleaners will break the bonds in the acrylic plastic. Unfortunately, they're far less effective once the paint itself has set into the clothes. If the stain is completely dried and you haven't seen any improvement from the alcohol-based cleaners, a heavy-duty paint remover may do the trick. Keep in mind, however, that paint removers have some tough chemicals in them, and they might strip the dye from your shirt completely. As such, they should only be used as a last resort."

If it comes out of the laundry with the stain in place, there's nothing you can do outside of covering it up. Luckily, certain stains (especially on black clothing) can be covered quite well with fabric pens and other \"destaining\" products."

There are fabric pens available that are specifically intended for covering up paint stains. Go to a arts or fabric store and try to find a pen that matches the colour of your clothes. Paint shows up on jeans like a sore thumb, but you may be in luck if denim is your problem. Because denim tends to be in shades of blue and black, there are lots of paint pens that fit this range."
