Making Panang Curry Prepare the chilies. Begin making the curry paste by soaking the dried chilies in water for about twenty minutes until they are soft.

If you don\u2019t want to roast the seeds, you can skip the step, though it will alter the flavor slightly. If you want to simplify the process of making the curry, you can buy Panang curry paste from an Asian specialty store instead of preparing it from scratch. Combine the paste ingredients and grind. After roasting your seeds, use a mortar and pestle to grind them and make a powder. Then remove them and grind the chilies and salt to make a paste. Add the lemongrass and grind, then combine all of the paste and use the mortar and pestle to create a thick paste. Cut the meat into bite sized pieces. Take the pork or beef and cut with the grain of the meat to make bite sized pieces. You can make long slices or small cubes depending on what you prefer. Heat up \u00bd cup of coconut milk in a skillet and fry the paste. Place a large pan on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Skim the cream off the top of the can of coconut milk, then add \u00bd cup of the cream to the skillet. When it is bubbling and sizzling, add the Panang curry paste and mix with a large spoon or spatula. Keep stirring to fry the curry paste. If it gets thick and seems to be burning, add in a couple tablespoons of coconut cream. Fry the curry paste for about five minutes. Add the meat. After you have fried the curry paste for about five minutes, you should notice that some oil is starting to separate from the rest of the paste.

Garnish and serve. Add the lime leaves, then remove the pan from the heat. Add the basil leaves, then serve while hot! You may notice that the Panang curry is a little thicker than other Thai curries; this is normal, as Panang curry is a little drier than curries like red or green curry.",
