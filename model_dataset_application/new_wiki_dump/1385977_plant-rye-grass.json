The air temperature should reach between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 24 degrees Celsius) during the day. It\u2019s best to plant rye seed when the temperatures reach that point but may begin to fall in a few weeks (planting rye seed before it starts getting hotter can cause the rye to die)."

The annual seed does not germinate as well as the perennial, which means you\u2019ll need to use more of the annual variety to get the same lush look you could achieve with the perennial. You also have the option of using sod, which is pre-grown patches of rye that you purchase from a nursery and then lay over your prepared planting area."

You can use topsoil to fill in low areas, but the composition should have less than 20% clay, and it should not contain any herbicides."

You generally need 15 to 20 lbs (7 to 9 kgs) per 1000 square feet (9.5 square km) when you\u2019re using annual seed. Perennial seed should be spread at 10 lbs (5 kgs) per 1000 square feet.

Spread one half of it in one direction, and then spread the second half of the seed perpendicular to your first planting direction. This will help ensure an even spread of your seed. Depending on the size of your lawn, you may want to use either a push spreader or a hand spreader to spread the rye seed. Hand spreaders are typically used for small lawns that have large amounts of detail, while push spreaders may be best for larger lawns or new soil with larger open areas."

Rake gently - you don't want to move the seed around too much, and you don't want to damage the soil. If you're overseeding an existing lawn, it might be hard to rake the seed into the soil. If you can't rake an existing lawn, that's fine. The existing growth - even if it's short - should ensure the rye seed isn't disturbed."

Until the ryegrass takes root \u2013 about three days for sodded ryegrass and two weeks for seeded ryegrass \u2013 water your lawn two to three times a week. Your grass should be moist but not saturated. When puddles begin to appear after you water, you can cease watering regularly and proceed only as needed. Apply a high nitrogen fertilizer. Applying a fertilizer high in nitrogen helps the ryegrass grow. It\u2019s also great if you\u2019ve overseeded an existing lawn and will be using it later to grow vegetables.
