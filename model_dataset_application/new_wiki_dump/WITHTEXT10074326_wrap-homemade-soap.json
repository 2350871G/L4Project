          "description":"When you look at shrink wrap bags, you\u2019ll notice that the bottom edge is already sealed. Right next to the seam is a strip of excess plastic. Use your heat sealer to cut this bottom edge off. To use a heat sealer:\nPlug in and turn on your heat sealer. Open the heat sealer and place the bag between the blades. Close the heat sealer, like a paper guillotine. Wait 2 to 3 seconds, then open the heat sealer."

          "headline":"Insert your soap into the bag, making sure that it's centered.",
          "description":"Some people find it helpful to place a business card against the back of the soap while sliding it into the bag. This will help the bag lay flat as you insert the soap. If you do this, however, be sure to take the card out of the bag. Don\u2019t worry if the bag looks to be too big for the soap. This method will work for round, disk-shaped soaps as well. It is not recommended for other shapes, like hearts or stars."

        {
          "headline":"Seal the top and sides of the bag.",
          "description":"Open up your heat sealer and place the top edge of the bag between the blades. Clamp the heat sealer, wait 2 to 3 seconds, then open it. If the bag is too wide for the soap, slide the soap towards 1 side of the bag, and heat seal the remaining side. Place the soap close enough to the heat sealer so that it bumps against the edges of the outer frame. This will bring the blades as close as possible to the soap. There will be small gaps between the edges of the soap and the seams on the bag. This is perfectly fine. Every so often, scrape the heat sealer\u2019s blades clean with the top/blunt edge of an X-acto blade."

        {
          "headline":"Heat the front, back, and side edges of the soap with a heat gun.",
          "description":"Get out a craft-grade heat gun and turn it on. Aim the nozzle at the soap, and heat all sides of the soap until the plastic shrinks against it. Start with the side edges, then do the front. Don\u2019t worry if the seams look loose and wrinkly. You\u2019ll fix that next. Don\u2019t use a hairdryer; it\u2019s not strong enough. You can get heat guns from the embossing section of a craft store."

          "headline":"Re-heat the sides while rubbing them across a flat surface.",
          "description":"Get out a hard, flat surface, such as a wooden cutting board. Heat one side of your soap with your heat gun, then rub that side against the flat surface. Repeat this step for each side of the soap. You only need to do this for the sides that have the seams. If your soap is disk-shaped, then work your way around the circumference of the soap, 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) at a time."

If you\u2019re worried about the label getting dirty or ruined, then cover the soap with a second layer of shrink wrap. Use the exact same process for the second layer of shrink wrap as you did for the first. If the second layer of shrink wrap gets air trapped inside of it, press down on it. Poke a small hole through the outer layer with a pin, if you have to."

The labels should be long enough to wrap around the length of your soap, plus an extra 2 inches (5.1 cm) for the overlap. Make the labels about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. Print the labels off on adhesive paper and cut them yourself, or order them online. This method works only for square or rectangular soap shapes. It won't work for disk shapes."

Next, flip the soap over so that the back is touching the paper, and continue flipping it over until the paper is wrapped around it. Wrap the paper tightly enough so that it is nice and snug."

This will create a set of triangular flaps on the front and back of the soap. Do this just for one side of the soap; it does not matter if it is the left or right side. Hold the soap steady so that the paper doesn't unravel."

          "headline":"Fold the back flap down, like wrapping a gift.",
          "description":"Your soap will have two flaps: one on the front of the soap, and one on the back, where the seam is. Take the seam-side flap, and fold it down. It should be touching the side edge of the soap and part of the front flap. Make sure that the soap does not slide around inside the wrapper. You want an equal amount of paper sticking out to either side of the bar."

          "description":"Fold the top and bottom corners down first. Next, fold the back flap down so that it covers the side of the soap. Finally, take the front flap, and wrap it onto the back of the soap. If you used a piece of tape for the other side, you should use one for this side as well. If you plan to use a label instead, just hold the first side steady while you wrap the second."

          "description":"Center the label on the front of the soap, then wrap one end over onto the back. Take the other end of the label, and wrap it onto the back of the soap as well. The label needs to wrap around the side edges of the soap, not the top and bottom. Alternatively, wrap a piece of ribbon or string around the soap instead, then tie it into a bow."

Don't worry about being too precise when it comes to the size of the plastic, however; you'll be stretching and trimming it later. This method is not recommended for hot or cold process soap, as that type of soap needs to \u201cbreathe.\u201d\nThis method is great for melt-and-pour soap."

Next, take the bottom edge and pull it tightly across the back of the soap, just like you did with the top edge. Again, the plastic shouldn\u2019t go past the top edge of the soap.

A piece of tape is all you really need, but a label can give your soap a professional touch. For example:\nIf you own a store, you could print out your logo and use that as a sticker label.

Wrap it around the middle of your soap, overlap the ends in the back, and secure them with tape or glue. The strip can be whatever width you want. Something between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5.1 cm) would be ideal, however. Scrapbooking paper or wrapping would work great for this, but you can create your own design on the computer, print it out, and use that instead.
