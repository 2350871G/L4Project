If possible, try to work at a lower, kid-friendly table (you can sit down if that\u2019s easier for you). Look for kid-sized kitchen tools as well. A kid-friendly workspace and tools can also help a child feel more engaged and eager to learn."

One eight-year-old might be chopping cucumbers, while another is better left to mixing up the salad dressing. While a child\u2019s eagerness shouldn\u2019t override your judgement regarding their skill level and cooking experience, a kid who is itching to try out a new cooking technique is more likely ready to give it a go. Use the inverse as a guide as well:  if a child is hesitant to try using a chopping knife or the stovetop, it may be best to hold back for the time being."
