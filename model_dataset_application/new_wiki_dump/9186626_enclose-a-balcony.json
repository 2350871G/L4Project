Depending on the kind of curtains you buy, they may be hung with a rod or attached at the corners of the balcony with brackets or hooks. Outdoor curtains and drapes can be bought at most home centers, hardware stores, and also at many general retailers. Add a dash of color to your drapes by gathering them together with a length of ribbon. You can even swap out ribbon colors for a more festive balcony during holidays."

          "description":"Mosquito curtains come in a variety of colors and cuts. You can hang these curtains on curtain rods, but the fabric is light and can also be tacked into place around the perimeter of your balcony. Mosquito curtains are usually made of durable, machine washable fabric. If you want an enclosure that\u2019s inexpensive and resilient, these are a great option. Because mosquito curtains are usually lightweight, light colors may be semi-transparent. If privacy is your goal, choose a dark color for your mosquito curtains. If you like the look of outdoor drapes but hate being pestered by bugs, layer mosquito curtains inside the outdoor drapes."

          "description":"Bamboo roll up blinds offer excellent privacy and some additional protection from the elements. Because they\u2019re relatively solid, they block the wind. Most bamboo roll up blinds hang from simple screw-in brackets. If you live in an especially windy area, you may want to install adhesive Velcro strips at the sides and bottom of the curtain to hold it more firmly in place. When bad weather is on its way, roll up your bamboo blinds. Even well-installed blinds may break in high winds, driving rain, and hail."

Space the magnets evenly on the strips, and remove the magnets to take down the material. Although there are many ways you might attach the metal strips, strong glue or mounting brackets work well, are easy to install, and are relatively inexpensive. For your magnets to stick to the strips, the metal will need to be made of iron, nickel, or some other kind of magnetic metal. When in doubt, check metal with a magnet."

Cut three segments of netting long enough to hang to the floor and wide enough to extend to both ends of each side of the balcony. Thread same-sized dowels through the top and bottom of each net segment. Screw in eye hooks at the top and bottom of your balcony, then insert the dowels in the hooks. Small to moderate sized balconies will likely only need hooks at the four corners of the balcony. Larger balconies should space eye hooks about every foot (30.5 cm) or so. Zip-ties can be used to support the netting and keep it from bunching up. Simply add the ties at regular intervals along the top of the dowel and the attached netting. If your netting isn\u2019t long enough, you can zip-tie segments together to make larger pieces."
