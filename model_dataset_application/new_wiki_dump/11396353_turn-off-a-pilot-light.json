If you aren\u2019t able to turn the thermostat off entirely, set it to the lowest temperature possible. That way, the furnace won\u2019t kick in while you\u2019re trying to turn off the pilot light.

If you still aren\u2019t able to find a dial, then you may need to turn the gas off at the intake pipe. Look for a straight or round lever on the gas line leading to the furnace. If you still aren\u2019t able to find the valve or dial that controls your furnace, check the furnace\u2019s user manual to see if you can locate it. If you don\u2019t have a manual, then you may need to call in a repairperson. It\u2019s possible that your furnace has both types of shut-off valves.

Turning off the pilot light on your furnace during the summer months may be able to save you up to $50-60 USD in gas each year. If the dial doesn\u2019t turn easily, don\u2019t try to force it off since you may have a faulty component.

Your furnace pilot light may take a few seconds to go out, but it will turn off once it burns through the gas. Put a piece of tape on the lever or knob so no one accidentally turns it back on. That way, you can prevent accidental gas leaks.Tip: The pilot light may stay on for a few seconds after you turn off the furnace since there is still natural gas in the intake pipe."
