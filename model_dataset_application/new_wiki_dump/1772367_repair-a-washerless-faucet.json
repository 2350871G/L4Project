Ball faucets have a single handle that rotates over a ball. One handled faucets on a cylinder may be cartridge or ceramic disk faucets. The cartridge is more likely as it needs repairs more often, so start with those instructions. If they don't match what you see, try the ceramic disk instructions. Two handled washerless faucets are cartridge faucets."
