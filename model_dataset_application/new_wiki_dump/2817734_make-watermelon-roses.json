  "text":" Choosing your watermelon Get some fresh whole watermelon. Pick some in the grocery, in the market or if you already have, you don't need to buy. Wash the watermelon. Make sure it is extra clean. Roses Cut your watermelon in half. Make sure it is equally divided. Get on half and leave the other half behind. Cut a 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick slice. Cut it vertically. This should be a long slice. Take the slice and cut it into 4 pieces. Make it as equal as possible. Think about cutting a pizza. Take one piece then cut out a square. Don't include the green part. Cut off the bottom 4 edges of the square.  Cut small pieces off the 4 edges on top.  Carve some \"C\" on the corners. Make it thin. You should make 3 \"C\". Carve some \"V\" around the center. Again, make it thin. You should make 2 \"V\". Carve a small \"O\" in the middle. Only one \"O\". Smooth the edges for a better shape. You should now make a rose like shape. You can repeat the steps until you get the desired amount. Leaves Cut the outer piece of the watermelon. This is the green part. Carve it until you get a leaf shape.  Smooth out the bottom.  Repeat until you get the desired amount.  Plating Place your rose at the plate.  Place the leaves at the middle of each rose. ",
