          "description":"Buy pre-made cinnamon rolls from your local grocery store. Cut each roll in half, then shape the halves into heart shapes by hand. Bake these on a baking sheet according to their package instructions, then remove them from the oven. Allow the cinnamon rolls to cool, and enjoy. Beyond the heart shape, you can increase the Valentine\u2019s Day appeal of this treat by adding a layer of pink frosting on top of each baked roll. Allow your rolls to cool completely before frosting them. While they\u2019re still hot, the frosting will melt, which could ruin your design. Add edible toppers, like colorful sprinkles, heart shaped candies, and so on, to your cinnamon rolls to decorate them."

To continue with the Valentine\u2019s theme, you might want to use a red jelly or jam on your heart shaped sandwich, like raspberry jam or strawberry jelly.
