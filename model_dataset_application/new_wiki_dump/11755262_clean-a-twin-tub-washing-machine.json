Turn the dial on the washing tub to \"Drain\" to let all of the water drain out easily. Wait until all of the water has drained out before moving the hose so you don't accidentally spray water.The washing machine's hose can connect to two spots on the machine\u2014one at the top to fill it with water, and the other at the bottom of the machine to drain it. Both connecting spots are easy to find. If you\u2019re using a bucket and the bucket fills up before the tub is finished draining, move the dial back to \"Off\" and dump out the bucket to reuse it."

It's important to wipe down the machine every time you use it so it stays super clean.Avoid using harsh fabrics or scouring pads to wash the machine. Compared to a regular washing machine, a twin tub doesn't have nearly as many holes, nooks, or crannies, so it doesn't get as dirty. The main thing you'll want to wipe down is the pulsator, which is the round piece at the bottom of the tub."
