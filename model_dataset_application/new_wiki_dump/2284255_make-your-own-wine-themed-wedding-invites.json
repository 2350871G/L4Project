      "description":"If you are customizing with stamps or stencils, then you can find a template or make your own using a word processing program or another computer program. The following are some good places to look for wedding invitation templates:\nSellers, such as \"I Do\" it Yourself, on the Etsy marketplace provide electronic templates of wedding invitations. You send them the necessary information and they create a graphic design that looks like their samples online. \"I Do\" it Yourself even carries a template featuring a vine for $30. Once you receive the image in pdf or jpg format, you can print it out on your own printer. Buy a wedding invite kit. These kits include paper, envelopes, embellishments and smaller cards. Most kits allow you to do the printing at home. If you choose a simple kit, then you can embellish with stencils and stamps while getting your paper in a convenient package. Visit a local paper or stationery shop to inquire about discounts for local paper and wedding invitations. Many of these shops print them for you, which will be at an additional cost, but you may find a good deal on pre-printed, themed wedding invitations. Gather clip art online and make your own wedding invitation in a word processing program. This option may be the least expensive and the least elaborate. Ask a graphic designer to make a wine label with your wedding details on it. If this graphic designer can create a jpg image in small and large sizes, you can place it onto your wedding invitations in a software program and then print them. You can also use it for wine bottles at the wedding and on other accents."
