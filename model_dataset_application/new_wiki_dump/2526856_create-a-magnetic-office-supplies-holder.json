  "text":" Organize Supplies and Gather Materials Identify which supplies could be housed inside small plastic jars. Generally smaller supplies like paper clips, thumbtacks, rubber bands, staples and binder clips are ideal for this project. Pick up materials needed to create your space saver. You\u2019ll need one jar per supply group (i.e. one for paper clips, one for thumbtacks, etc.). Additionally, pick up a magnetic knife or tool holder strip (typically found in the kitchen section of the bath and home store) and charge your electric screwdriver (to help you mount the strip underneath your cabinet). You should also obtain a clamp (or an assistant) to hold the magnetic strip in place during the mounting process. Consider how many jars you will need, the jar sizes and the amount of space you have when purchasing the magnetic strip. If you have several supplies you may need to find a few spots underneath shelves and pick up more than one magnetic strip. Purchase a few fender washers if your plastic jars do not have a metal lid. You\u2019ll have to glue one washer to the top of each lid so the jar holds onto the magnetic strip. Mount Magnetic Strip to Cabinet Choose an overhead cabinet or shelf that is located near your desk or work area. The last thing you want to do is constantly have to get up from your desk to retrieve supplies, so look for a shelf or area that is near your work space. Clamp the magnetic strip underneath the chosen cabinet. You may want to just clamp the strip first and see how it looks or how you will use it before adding screws and making it a permanent fixture. Drill pilot holes into the shelf (by lining the holes in the magnetic strip up first) and then mount the strip. The magnetic strip package will most likely include screws and instructions on the best way mount it. Fill Jars With Supplies and Use Add supplies to the jars (dividing one supply type per jar). Avoid overfilling jars so that you don\u2019t crowd supplies and can easily add the lid. Also, in some cases if supplies become too heavy the jars could drop off the magnetic strip. Glue the washer to the top of the lid if your jars do not have a metal lid. Center the washer on the lid and add glue around the bottom perimeter. Allow the glue to dry for several hours before using. Tighten lids on top of jars and stick jars to the magnetic strip. Arrange jars along the magnetic strip--ready for use! Finished. ",
