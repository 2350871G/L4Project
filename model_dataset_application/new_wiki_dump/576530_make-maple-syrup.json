To build an outdoor fire for sap boiling, follow these steps:\nGet one or more 5 gallon pots. Dig a shallow hole in the ground where you want to build the fire. Build a box out of cinder blocks around the hole. It need only be large enough to accommodate all of your pots. Set a fire grate in the box to hold the pots, leaving enough space below the grate to build a fire. Build a fire under the grate so it will heat the pots."

The process of boiling sap down to syrup takes many hours, and you can't take any breaks or you'll end up with burned maple syrup. The fire needs to be hot enough to keep the sap boiling constantly, and you need to keep adding more sap when the liquid gets low - even if it means staying up all night.
