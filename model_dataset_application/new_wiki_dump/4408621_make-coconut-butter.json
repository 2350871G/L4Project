          "description":"To make coconut butter, you simply process shredded or flaked coconut in a food processor or high-quality blender for about 20 minutes. Depending on the size of your blender or food processor, you can work in batches as large as 7 cups (651 g) of coconut at a time. The best machines for this process are:\nFood processor\nNinja\nVitamix\nBlendtec"

          "headline":"Blend the coconut.",
          "description":"Turn your food processor on high and mix the coconut. As you process the coconut, it releases oils and becomes a spreadable paste with the consistency of peanut butter. If you're pressed for time, you can speed up the process by adding 1 to 2 tablespoons (6 to 12 ml) of melted coconut oil to the mix as well. The melted coconut oil adds moisture and lubrication to the coconut. This helps to keep the coconut together better, meaning you won\u2019t have to stop as often to scrape down the sides."

Remove the lid and use a spoon or silicone spatula to scrape down the sides of the food processor and pack all the coconut back around the blades. You will have to stop to scrape down the sides every 30 seconds to a minute during the processing."

          "description":"Turning shredded coconut into coconut butter will take about 20 minutes of blending, and during that time you'll have to stop 20 to 40 times to scrape down the sides of the food processor to get the coconut blending again. The coconut butter is ready when it\u2019s thick but slightly runny and spreadable."

If there are any leftovers, transfer them to a clean glass jar with an air-tight lid (such as a mason jar). You can store the coconut butter on the shelf for a couple months, or keep it in the fridge to make it last even longer."

There are three ways that you can toast coconut, and one of the more popular is baking it in the oven. Spread the coconut out on a baking sheet or two, depending on how much coconut you're using to make your butter. Make sure the layer is thin so that it cooks evenly. Place the coconut into an oven preheated to 300 F (149 C). Toast the coconut in the oven for about 20 minutes. Mix it around every five minutes to ensure it cooks and toasts at an even rate. Remove the coconut from the oven and allow it to cool to room temperature before using it for coconut butter."

Spread the coconut out in a large skillet. Place it over medium heat and cook the coconut for about five minutes. Stir the coconut frequently to prevent burning and promote even cooking. The coconut is ready when it turns a golden brown. Remove from the heat and cool before processing."

Coconut can burn easily in the microwave, which is why you want to cook it in small sessions. Spread the coconut out on a microwave-safe plate or dish. Set your microwave to high and microwave the coconut in 30-second increments. Stir between every cooking session. The coconut will take about eight minutes to cook. It\u2019s ready when it turns golden brown. Give the coconut a few minutes to cool down after toasting, then transfer it to your blender for coconut butter processing."
