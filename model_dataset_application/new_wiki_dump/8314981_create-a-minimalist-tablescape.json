Place a series of low cups \u2013 either plastic or clear glass \u2013 inside the dish. You should be able to get four to sit on the floral foam.

Other examples include a single white candle in a plain-looking copper candlestick holder, a succulent in a squat, black pot, and a single white rose or tulip in a small black or clear vase.
