Thane: If you take too much time keeping Thane apprised to Talid's location, his son Kolyat will assassinate him, and you will not gain Thane's loyalty.

If you have accrued a high enough Paragon/Renegade score, you can open a Charm/Intimidate dialogue option to defuse the conflict while maintaining both squadmates' loyalties. If you do not have a high enough Paragon/Renegade score, however, you will be forced to side with one or the other. In this case, you will lose the loyalty of whoever you sided against, although you can gain back their loyalty afterwards by talking to them with a high enough Paragon/Renegade score to unlock the Charm/Intimidate dialogue choice that will get you back in their good graces. If you side against Jack in her feud with Miranda, however, your loyalty will be permanently lost."

They are as follows:\nHeavy Ship Armor: Unlocked and after completing Jacob's loyalty mission. If you do not have it, Jack will die. Multicore Shielding: Unlocked after Tali's loyalty mission. Without it, one of your crew members will die. Thanix Cannons: Unlocked after Garrus's loyalty mission. Without it, one of your crew members will die."

If you do more than one mission after the crew's abduction, they will die by the time you reach them. As such, it's recommended to save the Reaper IFF mission until you have completed everything you wish to complete, then use the short time you have before the Collector's abduction of your crew to complete Legion's loyalty mission."

In contrast, it is best to leave tankier squadmates such as Grunt, Zaeed, and Garrus to hold the line, as this will ensure the survival of everyone else holding the line (so long as they are loyal, of course)."
