          "description":"Classic cucumber cream cheese sandwiches are dainty treats, typically served as a snack or part of a tea service and are usually made with white bread. Traditional English cucumber sandwiches rely upon soft white bread that won't compete with the flavor or texture of the fillings. Of course, if you want a heartier meal, break traditional and experiment with a strong rye or a sweet brown bread. You can even try sweeter white-flour breads like brioche, which is made with egg and butter."

          "description":"Most recipes for cucumber sandwiches suggest that you use seedless English cucumbers, which are readily available in most grocery stores. You don't have to stick to this variety, though. Making cucumber cream cheese sandwiches can be a great way to use up cucumbers from your garden harvest. You should choose a \u201cburpless\u201d variety, which has lower levels of cucurbitacin, a natural organic compound that is responsible for some cucumbers' bitter flavor and tendency to cause stomach upset in people. Some great choices are as follows: striped Armenian cucumbers, the Suyon Long, the Straight Eight, the Lemon Cucumber (which has, as the name suggests, a lemony flavor), and the Sumter (a particularly disease-resistant variety). All of these are known among gardeners as good \u201ceating\u201d pickles. Save the cucumbers with high levels of cucurbitacin for pickling."

There's nothing wrong with breaking from tradition now and again, though! Experiment with these different filling options:\nOption #1: Mix 4 ounces cream cheese with 1-2 ounces of goat cheese. Mix in fresh lemon juice to taste (about 1-2 tablespoons), and salt and pepper to taste. Option #2: Mix 4 ounces of cream cheese with 2 tablespoons of finely chopped dill. Mix in fresh lemon juice to taste (about 1-2 tablespoons, but more if you'd like), and season with salt and pepper. Option #3: For a zestier filling, mix 4 ounces of cream cheese with 1/4 cup of mayonnaise. Add in either 1-2 tablespoons of Ranch dressing OR about \u00bd packet of dry Ranch dressing seasoning mix (start with a small amount of  dressing\u2014whether it's wet or dry\u2014and increase as needed). Season with salt and pepper to taste, but know that you may need less salt with this filling mixture."

If you like the flavor of the peel or like the added crunch it brings to your sandwich, leave them on. If your cucumber has seeds, consider removing them. This will result in a crunchier final sandwich, but many chefs lament the loss of the flavor that the seeds/middle of the cucumber lends. Slice the cucumbers very thinly. It's easiest to cut your cucumber into thin rounds, but some chefs prefer to cut the cucumber length-wise. You can also cut the cucumbers on a bias: Angle your knife forty-five degrees to your left (imagine a clock in front of you: place the tip of the knife at 10 o'clock and the handle of the knife down towards 4 o'clock). Proceed to cut into thin slices."

Though you've already seasoned your filling, you may want to sprinkle just a bit of salt and/or pepper on top of the cucumbers. Place a second piece of bread (which has also been spread with the filling) on top of the cucumbers, and firmly press down."
