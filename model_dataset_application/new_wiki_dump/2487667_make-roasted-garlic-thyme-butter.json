  "text":" Cooking the Garlic Place peeled whole cloves of garlic in a small saucepan. Leave enough room for all of the garlic to fit on the bottom of the pan. Cover the garlic with olive oil. Use enough oil to completely cover the garlic cloves but not so much that the cloves are totally submerged. Simmer over low heat. Simmer for approximately 30 to 40 minutes or until the garlic is soft and golden brown. Scoop the fully cooked garlic into a small bowl. Use a slotted spoon to do this. Mash the garlic with a spoon or small potato masher. Mix well. A fork also works well for mashing soft garlic. Strain the excess oil in the pan through a coffee strainer. Return to a sealed container (or you can use it as garlic infused olive oil). Processing the Butter Place the butter in a food processor. Process until smooth and creamy. You may want to use the \u201cpulse\u201d speed option to achieve the ideal consistency. Add \u00bc cup of the mashed garlic, 1 \u00bd teaspoon of the reserved garlic oil, the fresh thyme (pre-minced) and a pinch of salt.  Process the ingredients until well blended. Avoid over processing as you will want to see small chunks of garlic and thyme in the finished product. Sample the blend. Add more salt if necessary. Refrigerate and Serve Spoon the mixture into a glass bowl and refrigerate. You only want to keep the butter in the refrigerator until it firms slightly. Remove from the refrigerator once it begins to firm.  Mold the mixture into a butter log or roll (or something near enough): Line the countertop with wax paper or aluminum foil and place butter mixture on top. Push the sides of the mixture together and form a roll. Wrap the butter roll inside wax paper or aluminum foil. Tuck the ends underneath and return it to the refrigerator to firm. Finished. Turn the butter out onto a small butter plate. Serve with the meal, providing butter knives so that diners can help themselves.",
