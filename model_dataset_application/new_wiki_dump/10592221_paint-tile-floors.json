Hold it firmly, turn it on, and move it back and forth in smooth, consistent strokes. You can buy a hand-held electric sander online or at your local home improvement store. If you choose to sand by hand, use a 180-220 grit synthetic sandpaper, such as silicon carbide or aluminum oxide."

Let the cleaner sit for about 15 minutes, and then scrub the entire floor, including the grout lines, with a nylon scrub brush. Mop away the cleaner using a bucket of warm water, and repeat the process to ensure your floor is as clean as possible. Check the instructions on your cleaning product to see if it should be mixed with water first. You can also make your own homemade cleaning solution by mixing equal parts bleach and warm water."

Avoid oil-based paints unless you're working on a small project. They aren't recommended for large-scale painting because they're expensive and they give off volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can harm the atmosphere and your family's health."

Most primers dry to the touch in about 30 minutes to 1 hour. It can take up to 3 hours for the primer to dry thoroughly enough to paint over it.

Apply a thin coat to the floor with a bristle brush, using long, broad strokes. Make sure to spread it evenly, with no pools or drips. Let it dry for 4 to 6 hours and apply another coat. Use 2 to 3 coats. Use a water-based polyurethane rather than an oil-based one, which can yellow the color of your tiles.

Move your stencil to the next tile and repeat. Allow the paint to dry completely and seal with a water-based polyurethane sealant. Find a stencil in a pattern you like at your local home improvement store or online. Make sure that it fits the dimensions of your tile.
