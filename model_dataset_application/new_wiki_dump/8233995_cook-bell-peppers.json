Outside of season they have to be imported or grown in greenhouses, which makes them more expensive and they are often not as fresh as during the summer months. Green peppers tend to be available first in the season, followed by the other colors later. In the Northern Hemisphere, the peak season for bell peppers is August to September, with main availability being from July to October. If you live in a warmer climate, the season will last much longer. In the Southern Hemisphere, the peak season for bell peppers is December to March.

Reject peppers that are shriveled and soft or that have damp, soft patches; these have passed their best-by date. If the stem has any mildew or decay, avoid it. Black spots indicate rain damage. If the shriveled ones are a bargain, it is possible to salvage them for sauces and chutneys, or for placing inside dishes where their flavor is desired but their appearance doesn't matter."
