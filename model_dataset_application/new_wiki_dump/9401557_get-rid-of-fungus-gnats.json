Avoid heating your soil using a tarp and solar energy outdoors, which may invite more pests. Controlling Adult Gnats and Larvae Set yellow sticky traps out. These can be found in any garden center. Egg-laying adults will be attracted to the yellow paper and then get stuck. Place several sticky paper traps in your potted plants or garden. Remove the traps when they are covered in flies and they will be unable to lay eggs. Set out a trap for adult flies. Vinegar (or beer) will attract and kill adult gnats. All you have to do is set out a few homemade traps. Pour ordinary vinegar (or beer) into several jars with lids. Add a few drops of dish soap to the liquid.
