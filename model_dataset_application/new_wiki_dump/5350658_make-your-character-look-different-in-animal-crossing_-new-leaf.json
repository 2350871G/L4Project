          "description":"One of the easiest facets of your character\u2019s appearance that you can change is his or her clothing. There are different clothing types and parts: dress, shirt, pants, skirt, shoes, and socks. Wearing a dress disables you from wearing pants or a skirt. You can wear socks and shoes no matter what (even if they\u2019re not visible). You can also wear custom designs (i.e. designs you, or someone else creates themselves), you can have them as tops, hats or umbrellas. They will not appear in your pockets, but as long as you have them on you in your design area, you can wear them."

You will see a variety of clothing on display at the Able Sisters\u2019 shop. Any item on display can be purchased. To find out the price, simply face the piece of clothing you\u2019re interested in and press \u201cA.\u201d This will start a dialogue with Mabel, who will then ask if you want to buy the item. You can also try on the item, if you want. Mabel will tell you what style it goes under which can come in useful for Gracie's fashion checks. Every day there is three tops or dresses for sale and two bottoms for sale in Able Sisters. The shop is open from 10am to 9pm by default, and will be that way for you unless you have the Early Bird or Night Owl town ordinances active."

It is worth noting, however, that if you wear a Mii mask, you cannot wear any accessories (such as those purchased at the Able Sisters) over it. You won't be charged the 3,000 bells if it turns out nothing has changed in your makeover. After getting your hair done 15 times you will get the option to get opposite gender haircuts as well."
