Consider what you already know about them, and ask them them questions about what they may want or need. If the parents have a more elegant taste, go with something which matches that style, like a fancy floral arrangement or a princess theme. For a young and fun couple, or a hipster style, choose something like the mustache theme, owls, or colorful bird cages for their new nesting baby! The new baby may bring some financial stress to the new parents. In this case, choose a centerpiece which is also practical and useful like a diaper cake, story books, or toys."

If your search gave you an idea you cannot find available online, or you would like to save some money and get creative, buy the items you need and put them together yourself. For instance, if you chose to make a useful and practical centerpiece, you can purchase a diaper cake online or make one yourself. You can even adorn the top of the \"cake\" with a stuffed animal or toy in line with your theme, as well as stacking items like bottles around each layer. Consider using baby washcloths as icing between layers. Your new parents will have both an attractive and useful centerpiece to take home with them. If you aren't crafty, consider reaching out to a friend to who could make the centerpiece for you. Send them the items you collected and be sure to explain exactly what you want the finished product to look like."
