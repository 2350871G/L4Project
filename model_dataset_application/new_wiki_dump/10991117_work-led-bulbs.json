Lumens measure brightness (the higher the number, the brighter the bulb), so it's a more accurate way to choose the bulb you want. For instance, the following is the wattage for incandescents, LEDs, and the corresponding lumens:\n100 watt incandescent = 16-20 watt LED = 1600 lumens\n75 watt incandescent = 9-13 watt LED = 1100 lumens\n60 watt incandescent = 8-12 watt LED = 800 lumens\n40 watt incandescent = 6-9 watt LED = 450 lumens\n\nRead the socket to find out what level of light is best.

Let air in for 15 minutes before attempting to clean it up and turn off fans or central AC/heating.
