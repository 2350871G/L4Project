The divisions should follow natural points on the plant (at nodes, or between leaves etc.). The important thing is to make sure each divided piece has shoots and roots on it. Replant each piece in good soil in a pot or sheltered garden bed and water thoroughly.  Taking Cuttings Select a suitable pot for your cutting. You might want to use a normal-sized flowerpot for one plant or you can even establish several cuttings in the same pot, planted apart from each other. Seedling tubes are also a good idea for many plants. Prepare the pot. Get a plastic (polythene) bag and place gravel at the base of the bag.
