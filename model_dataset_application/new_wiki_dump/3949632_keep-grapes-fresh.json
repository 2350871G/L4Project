Avoid clusters that are losing grapes left and right and opt for stems that are firmly connected. Although you can likely find them year round, the best time to look for fresh grapes is in the fall, when they're technically in season. Try looking for grapes at farmers markets to find fresher varieties than your average supermarket pick. Grapes at a farmers\u2019 market were typically picked 1-2 days ago, while supermarket grapes have probably been off the vine longer."

Choose red grapes that do not have any green tinge to them and are plump on the stems. Some types of grapes naturally take on different colors. For example, Japanese muscat grapes vary from light green to shades of red. Look for other signs of freshness if you\u2019re unsure about the ideal color.

Fresh grapes should smell sweet, so if you're picking up a whiff of something sour, look for a different bunch! You can also look for brown spotting on the grapes, which often accompanies the vinegar smell. The same process that causes grapes to spoil also causes wine to taste like vinegar if it isn\u2019t stored properly. If you come across sour wine, that probably means that the bacteria in the grapes has turned into acetic acid, and the wine has spoiled."

Rinse your grapes under cold water, pat them dry, and remove the grapes from their stems. Then, lay the grapes out on a baking tray lined with wax paper, to prevent the grapes from clumping. Don\u2019t try to thaw grapes out after freezing them, as they will taste mushy. Instead, pop them in a smoothie, use them as ice cubes, or eat them as is.
