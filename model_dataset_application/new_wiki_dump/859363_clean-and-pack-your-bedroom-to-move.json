          "description":"Before you start packing, make sure you have all the supplies you need. Depending on the amount of things in your room, buy at least 10 boxes ranging from large to small. Also get a roll of bubble wrap, masking tape, a black marker, and a trash bag or two. Also consider getting one or two wardrobe boxes for packing your nicer clothes. If you are transporting posters, buy cylindrical poster containers to protect them from damage. Keep tools like screwdrivers and cleaning supplies handy as well. Make sure you are wearing comfortable clothes that you can move around in, as well as sneakers or other flat bottomed, closed-toed shoes. Even though it may seem more efficient, don\u2019t buy only large boxes. Large boxes can get extremely heavy when packed, which will make carrying them a pain."

Take any fragile items like lamps or glass ornaments and wrap them liberally in bubble-wrap. Tape the bubble-wrap so that the item stays secure inside. Pack a small box, or several small boxes, with fragile items. Make sure that each box of fragile items is full so that the items don\u2019t slide around.
