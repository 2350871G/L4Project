I painted a building 10 years ago with exterior Behr primer and exterior Behr paint and it still has not peeled. You might have to use a belt sander to get off all the old paint but it is well worth it. Be sure and use a dust mask because old paint has lead and if you breath it, it will give you lead poisoning. I usually wash the windows with a hose to reduce dust but I have someone inside with towels that goes around the window to keep the water from leaking inside."
