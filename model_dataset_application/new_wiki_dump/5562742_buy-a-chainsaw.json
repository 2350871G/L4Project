They do, however, have limits as to how large a log they can cut, and require access to electric power to operate. Battery operated chainsaws: These do not require close access to electrical outlets, but have limited run time and significantly less power than other types. They are best for light trimming or cutting small branches. Gasoline chainsaws: These have the most power. They range from 27cc's to over 150, suitable for cutting anything from small branches to large trees. They can be temperamental and will require you to mix fuel. Hydraulic chainsaws: These are used for clearing limbs from power lines and even cutting underwater, but generally, they are niche tools, and since they require a remote motor to provide hydraulic power, they are not suitable for most users."

Choosing a brand Every brand has unique features and characteristics. Homelite and Poulan saws, for example, are inexpensive, and work well for most small projects.
