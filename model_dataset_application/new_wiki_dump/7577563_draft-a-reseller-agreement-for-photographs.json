Additionally, Company\u2019s total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the amount Reseller has paid Company during the twenty four (24) months preceding the event giving rise to such liability.\u201d Finalizing the Agreement Add a notices provision. Either you or the reseller might need to send written notice under the agreement. You should state the address where you want the notices sent and also explain acceptable methods of sending the notice. Your notice provision could read: \u201cAll notices required by this Agreement shall be given to the Party at the address specified on the first page. The notice shall be effective upon actual receipt.\u201d Add a choice of law provision. You can decide which state\u2019s law to use to interpret the contract. Typically, you should choose the state where you do business. Your choice of law provision could read: \u201cThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan.\u201d Include a merger clause. This clause states that the contract contains the entire agreement between you and the reseller. You should also state that any changes to the contract must be made in a writing signed by both parties. A sample merger clause would read: \u201cThis Agreement and its attachments constitute the entire Agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein. It may be modified or amended only with a written agreement executed by both parties.\u201d Add a severability clause. If you go to court in a breach of contract lawsuit, then the judge might find that one provision of the contract is invalid. You will want to explain that the rest of the contract should still be enforced. You can clarify this by including a severability clause. A sample severability clause could read: \u201cIf any provision is held unenforceable or invalid, then the remaining provisions shall not be affected but shall remain in full force and effect.\u201d Add a dispute resolution clause. If a dispute arises, you will probably want to try and settle the dispute outside of court. You could include a provision where each side agrees to arbitrate the dispute. Arbitration is like a trial; however, you present your case to a panel of arbitrators instead of a judge. Arbitration is typically faster and cheaper than lawsuits. It is also private. You can include an arbitration provision like the following: \u201cAny claim or dispute arising out of this Agreement or the breach thereof shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The number of arbitrators shall be three. The place of arbitration shall be [insert the city and state]. Judgment on any award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\u201d Insert a signature block. You should insert lines for both your signature and the reseller\u2019s signature. Also include a line for the date. Just above the signature lines, include this language: \u201cIn witness whereof, the Parties have signed this Agreement on the date above.\u201d Show your agreement to a lawyer. This article describes a basic reseller agreement. It might not work for everybody. Depending on your needs, you may need to add or revise the agreement. You should show it to a lawyer and ask if you should change anything. To find a qualified attorney, you can contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral. Also ask other photographers if they have used a lawyer. If so, get the lawyer\u2019s name and schedule a consultation. Show the agreement to the reseller. He or she will want to review it before signing. The reseller might have suggestions for changing the agreement. You should agree to everything in the agreement before signing it. After the agreement is signed, give the reseller a copy and keep the original in a safe location.",
