          "description":"After you report your card lost or stolen, federal law states you no longer have any liability for further charges you didn't make. Typically the company will cancel your card as soon as you report it; however, the credit card company legally can only hold you responsible for a maximum of $50 for each card that's lost or stolen, regardless of when you report it. Most credit card companies have automated lines that are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for reporting a lost or stolen card. If you're notified of a data security breach at a store where you've used your card, contact your credit card company and demand a replacement card be issued immediately. If your wallet is stolen, you should also contact local law enforcement and any other related companies or agencies. For example, if you had your health insurance card in your wallet, you should notify your health insurance company that your card was stolen so it can be replaced."
