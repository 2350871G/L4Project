Red or white quinoa will give it a slight crunch. Add a few spoonfuls of barley or quinoa if you're adding other grains or use about 1/2 cup (100 g) if not. You can also use cooked millet which is becomes light and fluffy."

          "description":"If you'd prefer to get your complex carbohydrates from a vegetable instead of from grains, use sweet potatoes. Cut one sweet potato in half and drizzle it with olive oil. Place it skin-side down on a baking sheet and roast the sweet potato in a hot oven (400 degrees F or 200 C) for 25 to 30 minutes. Cut the tender sweet potato into pieces and put it in your bowl. You may want to flip the sweet potato over halfway during baking time to ensure even browning. You don't need to peel the sweet potato."

          "headline":"Choose fresh or cooked corn.",
          "description":"Corn is a popular Buddha bowl starch because it gives the dish sweetness and beautiful color. You can use canned sweet kernel corn, thawed frozen corn, corn that you've cut right off of the cob or roasted corn. Use a few spoonfuls if you just want a little sweetness or use a large scoop if you want to add other vegetables that work well with the corn (like tomatoes, red pepper, and avocado). If you want to make a warmer Buddha bowl, try using cooked polenta. This will also make the Buddha bowl seem rich and creamy."

You can season and grill tempeh before slicing it up. Or cook seitan for a meat-like texture in your bowl. While most Buddha bowls are vegetarian or vegan, you can include meat proteins if you like. For example, shred some roasted chicken, flake some cooked fish, or use chunks of turkey breast."
