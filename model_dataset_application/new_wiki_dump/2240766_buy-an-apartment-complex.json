          "description":"You might want to buy an apartment complex that consists of only apartment buildings. However, you should also consider buying a \u201cmixed use\u201d complex. This type of complex also contains commercial real estate you can rent out. A complex that isn\u2019t currently mixed use could be converted. However, the zoning must allow for it. Also think about what amenities you want your apartment complex to have. For example, it may have a fitness facility, swimming pool, or common areas to hold private functions."

          "headline":"Consider hiring a real estate agent.",
          "description":"You\u2019ll want to buy a complex in an area that isn\u2019t declining, and an agent can help you identify these areas. Talk to other apartment complex owners about whether they worked with an agent and if they would recommend them. Ideally, you should go with someone who works as an agent full-time. A part-timer might not know the market inside and out. Of course, you can research apartment complexes on your own. Check online, talk to other investors, and drive around neighborhoods. However, an agent with experience in apartment complexes can save you time."

          "description":"Always visit a complex in person before deciding to buy. You should walk through all of the buildings on the complex and view any common areas. Take notes, and ask questions. Buying an apartment complex is a big investment, and you shouldn\u2019t go forward unless you feel comfortable with the condition of the buildings. Don\u2019t walk through only one building on the complex. If you do, then you might assume the other buildings are in equivalent condition. Be skeptical if the seller\u2019s agent resists showing you all buildings in the complex. Remember to visit in the evening so that you can check out the security features at the apartment complex. Walkways should be well-lit, doors properly locked, and no one should be loitering around the premises."

For example, ask about the following:\nHow many units are rented? It will be easier to finance an apartment complex that is being rented. How long have tenants been there? A complex with long-term tenants may be more stable. Why is the owner selling? Retiring or switching investments are legitimate reasons. However, an owner who is selling because they are losing money is a red flag. Keep in mind the reason an owner is selling may be confidential."

Analyze whether the current landlord has rented units too cheaply or whether the rent is in line with the market rate. Find comparable apartment complexes online. Look at how much they advertise their units for. For a great resource that can help you find out nearby rent prices, visit https://padmapper.com/. You can also ask different property management companies what is the market rate in your area. If the complex has commercial space, then a real estate agent can also help you figure out how much to charge."

However, don\u2019t trust it 100%. The owner might fudge some numbers to make the apartment complex more attractive. Double check the expense information:\nGet the complex\u2019s tax information from the county assessor. Estimate property management costs by contacting a property management company. Ask how much they charge. Typically, their fee is based on a percentage of the expected rent. Calculate the amount of maintenance needed. If you\u2019ve never run an apartment complex before, talk to a current owner. Ask how much they spend annually repairing each unit or the grounds. Ideally, you'd want to be spending around 40 percent of the money you're taking in on operating expenses."

Work closely with an accountant to crunch numbers and create the necessary financial documents to show a lender. You can find an accountant by contacting your state\u2019s society of public accountants. Calculate your net operating income, which is your gross income less expenses. Create a cash flow analysis. Show how the amount of money you have coming in compares to the amount you will be spending. When you're starting out, or during periods when the rental market is bad, you may not have any cash flow coming in. Keep in mind that lenders will also run their own numbers, as well as the appraiser who values the complex."

For example, accounts might be listed that aren\u2019t yours, or an account might be improperly listed as in default or collections. Also, the credit limit might be wrong. Start early.

          "description":"Loans for commercial real estate are not the same as loans you take out to buy your own home. Generally, loans can be for 30 years or as short as five or seven. Interests rates may also be variable or fixed. If you can get a non-recourse loan, then the building will secure the loan as collateral. However, non-recourse loans are not available for all borrowers, and the building typically must be worth at least $2.5 million. With a recourse loan, you remain personally liable for the loan. In the event of default, you can be sued, and you might lose personal assets. Recourse loans are riskier, but it might be the only type of loan you can get as a new landlord. Commercial loans also require a down payment around 30% of the purchase price. If you're having trouble getting a commercial loan, consider getting a real estate contract instead. Real estate contracts require a large downpayment, but they're less difficult to get approved for. The downpayment may be less than what a bank would ask for, depending on how much the seller wants."

If the market is hot, you may need to pay the asking price\u2014or even more. No matter how hot the market, insist on a 90-day escrow period. You\u2019ll want at least 60 days to get an inspection. That\u2019ll leave you with 30 days to review documents before closing. If you're using a lender, ask them how long they need to process your loan. Depending on your lender, you may need to ask the owner for more time to get everything together."

Find an inspector by getting a referral from a real estate agent or talking with another apartment complex owner. Check ahead of time what will be inspected. Ask if you need to hire a specialty inspector to inspect a swimming pool or tennis court. If the inspector finds problems, ask the seller for a credit, which will reduce the amount you pay.
