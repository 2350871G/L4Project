Note: It is not necessary that each coat is completely uniform, and do not try to even out the coats, as this will result in a layer that is too thick and will run.

  "text":" Preparing the Plates and Bases Remove any stickers, residue, or old candle wax from the bases and plates. Wash thoroughly. It is recommended that you run the items through the dishwasher and then hand dry off any water residue. Match up a base with a plate. Some plates have flat bottoms that can accommodate any base, while others have a rimmed edge that may prevent you from using wide-top bases. Make sure that the plate and top of base sit evenly against one another. Spraying the Plate and Base Prepare your work surface. In a well-ventilated area (garage, patio, porch), lay newspaper or plastic sheeting down as a protective layer. Spray the frosted glass coat as primer. Lay your plate upside down, with the base on top. (You will attach the base in the next section.) Spray a light even coat of the frosted glass spray over all surfaces. Let dry 15 minutes and repeat. Once the second coat has been applied and is dry, turn over the plate and spray a light even coat over the surface of the plate. Let dry 15 minutes and repeat. Dry for 30 minutes.
