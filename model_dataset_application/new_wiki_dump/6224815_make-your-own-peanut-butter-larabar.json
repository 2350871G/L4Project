Alternative Preparation Method Blend the peanuts and set them aside. You can blend in the chia seeds now, if you would like. Blend the pitted dates. Do this until it is almost paste like. Blend in the peanuts that you set aside, until they are of the proper consistency.  Wrapping Your Larabars Cut a piece of wax (or parchment) paper and lay on your cookie sheet.  Spread out the peanut mixture. Spread a piece of wax paper or plastic wrap on the mixture and roll it until it is about a half inch thick. Cut your larabars to your desired length. A good size is 1 X 2 or 2.5 inches (6.3 cm). Using the plastic wrap, wrap your individual bars. After you have them encased in a small piece of plastic, press them together.
