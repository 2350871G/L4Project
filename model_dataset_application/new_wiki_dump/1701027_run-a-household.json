This person will more than likely be the parent who is home more often, since their job will be to keep a close eye on the operations of the house. It does not matter which parent takes on this manager position, as long as it gets taken. True, in many homes the mother is the likely candidate, but fathers are just as capable of taking on this role. The same applies whether both parents work or one stays at home to care for the children. Whoever is home more often will be best suited as home manager. If one or both parents work from home, the parent who counts as \u201chome more often\u201d is the one available to give their full attention to the family most frequently."

You can be creative with how these categories get completed each week, but breaking household chores down into tangible categories makes running a home instantly easier. Making a separate to-do list for each category may help with organizing and prioritizing the household. You can organize tasks in each category in a number of ways. You can pick one category per day of the week and accomplish all tasks for that category each day.
