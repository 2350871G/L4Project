          "description":"Caffeine is a stimulant, just like many of the prescription medications those with ADHD use to tame their symptoms. Because of caffeine's effect on the brain, when someone consumes it, the levels of a key brain chemical (dopamine) are increased. Someone with ADHD who consumes caffeine is better able to process information, and will feel more calm and focused. Excess intake may still cause the stimulant side effects however, which may include anxiety. The effectiveness of caffeine for ADHD depends on the dosage. Moderate doses between 200-300 mg can lead to increased energy, enhanced concentration, and boost emotional well-being. High doses, however, of greater than 400 mg can cause you to feel jittery and nervousness."

This is the exact effect ADHD medications like Ritalin have. The blood flow affects how well the person processes information and pays attention."

Studies have shown that when used in conjunction with each other, at low doses, the two treatments compliment each other very well. In combination with higher levels of caffeine, however, the prescription proved to be the equivalent of no medication at all."

In the event one decides to reduce intake or stop using caffeine, there are risks. Headaches are one of the withdrawal symptoms. However, those who intake a lot of caffeine run the risk of having the shakes and the increased possibility of a heart attack. Remember that large amounts of caffeine have been proven to be ineffective. Limited quantities (between 200 and 300 mg) work best at helping  you to manage ADHD."

Students also saw a decrease in the severity of ADHD symptoms. If you or your child have ADHD, try getting regular exercise, in virtually any form, to see if it helps. Even if the effects are minimal, people who work out regularly still report feeling better about themselves and healthier."

The best tactics to improve sleep quantity and quality lie in developing a regular and consistent sleep pattern. Create a relaxing bedroom environment, and move all other activities elsewhere. Avoid caffeine or alcohol in the evenings for better sleep, too."
