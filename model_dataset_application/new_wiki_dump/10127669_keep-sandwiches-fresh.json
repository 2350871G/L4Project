          "description":"Crusty breads like baguettes are particularly dry as a result of the baking process, and thus do a better job of preventing sogginess in your sandwich. If you decide to use sliced sandwich bread instead, toasting the bread before making the sandwich will also help to keep moisture out and keep the sandwich fresh. If you\u2019re using standard sliced sandwich bread, buy a square loaf from a baker or supermarket that bakes their own bread in order to get the freshest bread possible. Certain types of bread also work best with particular fillings. If your sandwich will have heavy solid ingredients like meat and cheese, use a more robust crusty bread. If your sandwich will have a soft and more viscous filling like egg mayo, use a fluffier white bread that the ingredients will cling to."

          "description":"While almost any ingredients can be used in making sandwiches, wet fillings are much more likely to leave a sandwich soggy. Lightly butter the inside of the bread before adding your ingredients to create a moisture barrier between the fillings and the bread. Wash and thoroughly dry lettuce before adding it to the sandwich, and place tomatoes at the center of the sandwich between the meat and cheese. You might also consider packing wet ingredients like tomatoes separately in their own container, and adding them to the sandwich immediately before eating."

You can also place an individual slice of meat or cheese on a slice of bread and spread your condiment on that. For best results, never put the condiment directly on the bread."

Consider packing your bread and fillings separately and assembling the sandwich immediately before you eat it. This is especially convenient when making chicken, tuna, or egg salad sandwiches. If you make your sandwich a day in advance, store it in the refrigerator overnight wrapped in foil or plastic wrap and placed in an airtight container."
