  "text":" Finding the Compass Prepare For the Dungeon. To complete the dungeon you will need bombs, which you can purchase back in town or find around the mountain. Enter the Cave. Make your way up Mount Crenel and reach the Cave of Flames. Go through the door going right. Once inside, head through the door leading right. On the upper edge of the  room, the wall is cracked. Use a bomb to blow it up and a new path will open, go through it. Using your shield, bump into the spiky turtle enemies to flip them over. Once they are on their back kill them with your sword. Collect your prize. Once all of the enemies are dead, the chest containing your compass will appear. Finding the Map Head left. From the room where you obtained the compass, head left into a room full of rupees. Be careful of the enemy hidden within and make your way through the door on the upper side of the room. Travel through the new area until you reach a split path covered in tracks. Follow the tracks heading to the right. Hop in the mine cart which will take you to room 6. Make your way through until you reach another cracked wall on the left edge of the area. Blow it up with a bomb and pass through into room 7. Room 7 contains 4 masked enemies. Pull their masks off with your gust jar then slash them with your sword to kill them. Once you kill them all a portal will appear. Approach it, shrink down and travel through the door on the upper right side of the room. Avoid the spiky turtles and make your way right. You'll eventually reach a room full of bats, which contains a heart piece. You can't grab the heart piece while shrunken so simply head down for now. Enter the room on the downward side of the map. Once inside, travel around to the left side where there is a small gap in the stones. Use it to jump down and reach the portal. Use the portal to grow back to your true size. Don't forget your prize. Head up and climb back up to the upper level to grab a map from the large treasure chest. Obtain the Dungeon Item Cross the molten lake. Head back down then head down across the lava. On the left side you'll see a chest and a button. Open the chest, push the button and continue down to enter the next room. Ride the lift over to the other side which is covered in little armored enemies. Be careful since the platform will sink like the ones in the previous room. Fill the holes. If you hit the armored enemies they will curl into a ball. In their ball form you can maneuver them into holes with your sword to allow you to pass. If you knock one into the hole in front of the treasure chest you will net yourself 50 rupees. Maneuver one into the hole nearest to all of the pots, then climb up to the next floor. Float through the sky. Use the tornado in the room to float downward. Fly a little more. Land in the next tornado and use it to maneuver yourself around the wall of rocks and reach the chest on the right side. Once you are over there, push the square block aside and push the chest into the hole on the second floor. Inside is a key. Head through the upper door. You will wind up back in the hallway where the mine cart left you earlier. Now that you have a key, hop back into the mine cart and ride it back to the other side. Use your key on the door nearest to the mine cart. Follow the tracks and hit the switch with your sword before heading back to the cart for another ride. Once you're back in the hallway, head left until you find a door leading up. Ignore the cart. For now make your way across the tracks heading right. Blow up the wall on the downward edge of the other half of the map to grab a heart piece, then head through the door going up. Follow the path outlined in stone and then jump down. You'll be attacked by a group of gray slimes. I recommend using bombs to defeat them, otherwise just hit them when they revert from their spiky appearance. Claim the dungeon item, the [Cane of Pacci]. A chest will appear containing the [Cane of Pacci]. Grab it and head left. Getting the Boss Key Flip the hazardous platform. Use your [Cane of Pacci] to flip over the spiky looking platform and make your way to the left side of the map. Take to the sky. On the other side of the map, use your cane on the hole then jump in. It will launch you up to the upper level. Pressing the switch there will create a teleporter to take you back to the start. Ignore the teleporter for now. Unless you need to return to town for more bombs or something, the teleporter doesn't help you right now. Instead head through the door on the upper level. Use the cane to flip over the mine cart. With it now in riding condition go ahead and hop in. Obtain another key. In the new area, push the chest into the hole above and grab the key from within. Hop back into the cart. It will take you back to the door containing the teleporter. Enter that room and open the locked door. Shrink once again. In the next room, ignore the switch for now and use the stone portal to shrink. Carefully make your way through the bladed enemies to reach the door on the left side. Get back to your original size. Travel through the maze to another stone portal. Use it to grow, then carefully dodge the new bladed enemies to make it back to the mine cart. Flip it with the cane and hop in. Open the new pathway. Once you're back in the room with the green bladed enemies, flip the switch and hop in the cart once more. Fill some more holes. You should now find yourself in a room containing more of the metal ball enemies. Like before, strike them with your sword to maneuver them into the four holes on the lower-right side. Hit the switch. Pull the stone with the switch on it by moving close and holding \"R\" while pressing the d-pad in the opposite direction. Get the stone into the hole on the upper-left side and hit the switch with your sword to clear the way. Go up to the next floor then into the next room. Jump down using the uppermost gap to claim a kinstone, then use your cane on the closest hole to launch yourself up to another chest. Once you're finished, head right. Cross the river of lava. The next room contains a river of lava with more of those timed platforms. Wait for the spiky one to be headed downward, then quickly hit it with your cane before getting on. Do the same for the next two. Clear the path. Once you're on solid ground again, head to the edge of the path and use your gust jar to clear the pots from the next platform over. Like before, use your cane to flip over the spiky platforms and carefully make your way to the upper-right door. Go through and climb the stairs to the next level then hop down through the gap. Turn to the next hole, use your cane and launch up to the upper level. Hop down once more, this time on the left side. Use your cane on the hole and launch yourself into the tornado. Float up and land on the upper level. Follow the path right and hop into the next tornado. Float in a downward direction and land on the next platform. Follow it until it returns you to the river of lava. Hop into the tornado. Like before, hop over the edge and into the tornado. Float down and use your cane on the hole to launch yourself into the next tornado, float to the burning platform and use your cane on yet another hole. Finally reach the chest. Launch up to the next platform, hop into the next tornado and float from tornado to tornado. On the 3rd, you'll want to float up (left takes you to another kinstone but will force you to repeat quite a few steps). Float using another tornado and land on the platform with the big chest. Within is the boss key. Open the portal. You can jump off of the upper part of the boss-key platform to reach a platform with a switch. Hit it to create another teleporter that will return you to the entrance. Defeating the Boss Get prepped. Think about going to the fairy fountain on the mountain to catch a fairy in a bottle. The boss battle can be a little hectic and hearts can be tough to come by inside. Return to the start of the lava river room and catch the platform going up this time. Use your key and enter the boss room. Expose the boss's weakness. Now, the boss looks pretty menacing but he is pretty easy once you get the pattern down. Avoid his fire breath while waiting for an opening to shoot your cane at his shell. Go for his weak point. Once you successfully hit his shell with the cane, his neck will create a bridge allowing you to hit his weak point with your sword. Once he begins to shake quickly run back across his neck before he sinks back into the lava. Dodge the projectiles. He will stay submerged for some time just dropping rocks on you. #Rinse and repeat. After 3-4 successful rotations, he should die leaving behind the fire element and a heart container.",
