If you are untrained in knot theory, this can be tricky, but opening a knot is much easier if you know which loops and intersections are holding it together.

You won't be able to untie the knot if the ends outside of it are pulled tight. Get a firm grip on two strands of the knot with the tips of your fingers, one in each hand.

The Twist and Push Method Twist one loose end of the string as tight as you can. You want it so tight that the string becomes dense and less bendy. Firmly push the twisted end directly into the knot. The idea is that the twisted string will be twin and hard enough to overcome the friction of the knot and create some slack. Use the slack it adds to pull the knot apart. Once you've pushed some slack into the knot, you should be able to pull it apart as normal. The Spoon Tap Method Find a clear, level surface. Lay the knot on the surface. Bang on the knot with a firm but light object. A wooden spoon is ideal. Keep turning the knot around and giving it another bang until it loosens a little. Once there is a tiny gap, insert the end of tweezers or nail scissors into the little hole. Ease the knot open gradually. It should now slip undone. The Corkscrew Method Get an ordinary corkscrew. You can also use any other thin metal object, like a needle for smaller knots. Just be careful not to pierce and damage your string. Insert the point of the corkscrew between the strings of the knot. Basically any point on the knot will do. Wiggle and twist the corkscrew into the knot. Hopefully this will create some slack. Tug the corkscrew to loosen the knot, and untie as normal. ",
