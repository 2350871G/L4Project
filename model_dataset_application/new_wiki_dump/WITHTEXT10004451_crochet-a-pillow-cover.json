Or, you can use a pattern as inspiration and follow it loosely to create your own unique throw pillow. Search online for free patterns or visit a local craft store to find pattern books. For example, you might want to follow a pattern to the letter if you are trying to create a specific shape or design in your pillow cover.

Consider where you will place the throw pillow as well if you want it to match your other d\u00e9cor. For example, you could go with a red yarn if you have a lot of red in your living room. Or you can opt for a neutral color or a black or white yarn, which will go well with lots of d\u00e9cor types. You can find yarns that are fluffy, smooth, rough, and sparkly. Yarns come in weights ranging from very light (lace) to jumbo (extra thick)."

Check the yarn label or the pattern for a hook size recommendation.
