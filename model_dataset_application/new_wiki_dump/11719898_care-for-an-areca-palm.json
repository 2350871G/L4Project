          "description":"Get a potting mix or outdoor soil from your local gardening store or online. Check that the soil is labeled as well-draining and acidic so your palm can thrive. Break up the soil before you plant your areca palm so you know it\u2019ll be loose around the roots. If you\u2019re planting the areca palm outside, you may prefer to use your existing soil. Make sure it breaks up easily and check for standing water. If the soil is clumpy or you see puddles, it may be best to replace the soil with a commercial mix.Tip: Mix builder\u2019s sand, peat moss, or bark into your soil if it\u2019s clumping or clay-like. Make a 50-50 mix of soil and sand, peat moss, or bark to create a well-draining mix."

Place your root ball in the center of the pot, then cover it with more potting soil. Pat the surface of the soil gently to settle the plant but don\u2019t pack it down around the root ball.Some pots come with a built-in tray to catch excess water that flows out of the soil. If yours doesn\u2019t, buy a tray to set your planter on so that the water doesn\u2019t damage the surface beneath your plant."

For indoor areca palms, adjust your thermostat so the room temperature stays ideal.

Because of this, they don\u2019t need to be repotted often. Repot your plant in a planter that\u2019s 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) larger than its old pot every 2-3 years.

Pink Rot causes the fronds at the top of the plant to wilt and turn brown, while Ganoderma turns the lower fronds yellow and wilted. You can\u2019t treat these diseases, but you can prevent them by letting the soil dry out between waterings.
