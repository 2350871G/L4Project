      "description":"You can cover your cake with any color of icing or frosting you like, just make sure your message is written in a contrasting color. Apply a smooth layer of icing sugar glaze, use fondant icing, add some marzipan or apply a neat, smooth layer of butter cream frosting."

      "headline":"Write your message with a piping bag.",
      "description":"Fill a piping bag with a frosting or icing that is soft enough to flow from the piping bag. Use the line nozzle of your piping bag. If you haven't got a piping bag, you can try putting your frosting or icing in a sandwich bag and cutting a tiny piece from the corner of the bag you can squeeze out your message. A cone of baking parchment with a corner snipped off us another option. Practice writing your message on a plate before trying on the cake to see how easy the frosting is to work with. By piping onto a plate, you can scoop it off and place it back in the piping bag. Squeeze the bag gently and go slowly. Be extra careful at the end of each letter. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/18\\/Write-a-Message-on-a-Cake-Step-4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Write-a-Message-on-a-Cake-Step-4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/1\\/18\\/Write-a-Message-on-a-Cake-Step-4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Write-a-Message-on-a-Cake-Step-4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":505.27472527472526,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/2.5\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
