      "description":"There are four ways to perform the next step - the method will depend on your preference:\nPour the boiled water into a teapot that you have already placed the freshly  sliced ginger into. Put the lid on the teapot to stop the pot cooling down too quickly and to keep the aromatic ingredients in the tea. Steep for 10 - 15 minutes. If you boil the water in a saucepan rather than in a kettle, you can add the ginger to the saucepan and simmer for 15 - 20 minutes. Let it sit for 5 minutes before pouring after simmering. Use a tea ball to hold the sliced ginger and steep in a cup for 15 minutes. Make sure to use a saucer to cover the top of the cup to prevent the aromatic elements from escaping. All you need to do is add a few fresh ginger slice to cup, cover it with hot water and add a bit of citrus. Cover the cup with saucer and let it steep for some time."
