Use a sharp knife, and place the tip of your knife at the center of your cheese. Cut your cheese into even wedges about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) wide. Make even slices around the entirety of your wheel or pyramid. Then, you can cut the wedges into smaller slices depending on your cheese type. You can do this for soft, medium, or hard cheeses. When you are finished, you should have about 8-16 slices, depending on the size of your cheese and the thickness of your sections."

          "description":"If your cheese has a protective wax rind, cut this off before you slice your wedge. Take your knife and place it immediately next to the wax outer layer. Insert your knife into the cheese with medium pressure, and make 1 slice along the longest edge of your wedge. Then, turn your knife and make another slice to remove the wax on the shorter edge. You should easily cut away the wax in 1-3 slices. For example, slice off the wax from gouda and edam cheese wedges."

Cut your slices across the wedge\u2019s longest side, angling your knife from the tip as you make your slices. This will slice your wedge into thin, even pieces of cheese. You can slice your cheese as thick or thin as you\u2019d like. Aim for about \u20444\u2013\u20442 inch (0.64\u20131.27 cm) wide slices."

When you get to the last piece at the thickest side of your wedge, cut it in half lengthwise rather than width-wise. If your wedge is on the larger side, you may want to slice it in half first. Slice your cheddar, asiago, goya, and romano cheeses like this, for example."
