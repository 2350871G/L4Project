      "description":"Buy wire hangers that are exactly as shown and for good reason: thin hangers allow maximum loading. Get the large size wooden clothespins, they will not break and be durable. Avoid a small diameter cord because it will tangle easily and also avoid using a large diameter cord because a large cord will interfere with the function of the clothespin. Use clear nail polish, fabric glue or some other waterproof glue to keep the cords in place on the hanger and to keep the knots from unraveling."

Cinch the noose knot to the spring hole and make additional simple knots for good measure. If the cord is too thick, the clothespin will not open and close easily. If the braided line has its breaking strength labeled, buy some line that is between 25 - 75 pounds."

Tie the cord to the hanger tight so it will not slide sidewards. The knot to the hanger also binds the two hangers together. Keep the length of the cord between the hanger and clothespins to about three inches."
