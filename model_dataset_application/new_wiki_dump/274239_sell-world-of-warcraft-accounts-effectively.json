You can describe a sports car to someone that has never seen one.. they won't go \"Ooh!\" until they see a picture. The easiest way to take a picture of your warcraft, wow account is to get a character profile. I do not recommend using an armory profile. Do not make overstatements about your account, you buyers will lose trust the same way that you trust someone that knocks on your door and says they have the best vacuum cleaner in the entire world."
