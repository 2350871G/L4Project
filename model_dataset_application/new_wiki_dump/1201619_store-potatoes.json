Instead, choose one of the following options:\nUse the damaged potatoes within a day or two, cutting out any damaged or unattractive parts before use. \"Cure\" the potatoes to reverse damage and extend their storage life (see curing step below).

Symptoms to look for include:\n\nGreening: The potato gains a subtle green color. Over time, the flesh will soften and appear slightly withered. Often caused by exposure to light. If there is only slight greening, cut away the green portions of the skin before cooking. Sprouting: Small bud-like \"sprouts\" start to grow out of the potato. Usually accompanied by greening/softening. Cut the sprouts away before cooking if the potato isn't too soft or green. Rot: The potato appears to be visibly decaying \u2014 it may smell bad, have a soft texture, and/or be covered with mold. Throw out rotting potatoes and replace any paper that was touching them."

To cure your potatoes:\nLay your potatoes on a bed of newspaper in a cool, dark place. Raise the temperature to 50-60 degrees Fahrenheit (10-15 degrees Celsius), slightly higher than normal for storage. Let the potatoes sit this way undisturbed.
