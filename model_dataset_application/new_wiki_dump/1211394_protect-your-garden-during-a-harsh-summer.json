          "description":"When it\u2019s really hot outside, the best way to effectively water your garden is by using irrigation or soaker hoses. While these are slightly different from each other, they both deliver water slowly to the plants\u2019 roots, which prevents evaporation and saves water. Irrigation hoses use flexible plastic tubing that contains little holes. Water slowly drips from these holes into the soil. Soaker hoses are made of a porous material that water seeps through."

          "headline":"Use a light mulch.",
          "description":"Adding mulch to your garden will keep the soil protected from direct sun exposure and, as a result, allow the soil to stay moist for longer. You can use many different forms of mulch, but you\u2019ll probably have the best results with a light-colored mulch, such as dried grass clippings, because it\u2019ll reflect the sunlight. Use bark mulch around your shrubs. Wood mulch is great because it will shade the soil from the sun and break down over time, adding compost to your soil."

          "headline":"Water your plants in the morning.",
          "description":"During those hot summer months, it\u2019s best to water your garden in the early morning before the sun starts beating down. If you wait until midday or even early afternoon, most of the water will likely evaporate before it travels to the plants\u2019 roots. If you can\u2019t water your plants in the morning, the early evening is another good time to water."

          "headline":"Water your garden with rainwater.",
          "description":"Rainwater is a lot better for your plants than tap water because it contains all necessary natural minerals without any added chemicals. As a result, they\u2019ll thrive better if watered this way, especially if they\u2019re struggling in the heat. Consider installing a rainwater tank in order to collect enough rainwater to water your garden. These are relatively easy to install and are typically attached to your gutters."

Additionally, when plants are watered too much, the excessive moisture in the soil can cause bacteria to develop, oxygen to be in short supply, and ultimately create fungal disease. Resist the urge to water your plants too much when it\u2019s really hot outside. Your plants only really need to be watered if the soil is dry. To prevent overwatering, touch the soil to make sure it\u2019s dry before you decide to water the garden."

Old sheets, old window screens, or narrow panels of wood lattice can all effectively cover and cool the plants in your garden. However, make sure that the cover is kept at least several inches above the plants. If using a cloth cover, staple each end to stakes placed on either side of the garden. Ideally, covers should block about 50% of the sunlight."

If you move your transplants to the garden when it\u2019s really hot, make sure to put them in the shade of other larger plants. This will greatly help in protecting the transplants."
