Buy orchid plants as opposed to buying orchid seeds, as orchid seeds require sterile conditions and will take 2-5 years to bloom.

          "headline":"Expose potted orchids to sunlight gradually.",

Then, after a week, move your orchid into an area with 3-4 hours of morning and evening sun. After 1-2 more weeks, move the orchid into an area where it receives sun before 10 am and after 2 pm. After that point, you can plant the orchid outdoors. Orchids don't like full intense sun, so find a spot outside that gets shade from around 10-2; you want to make sure your orchid is getting only morning and evening sun, when it's cooler."

          "headline":"Pot your orchids for convenience and mobility.",
          "description":"Potting your orchid will allow you to move it to any location you like. Choose a pot with a drainage hole at the bottom, as the orchid's roots may rot if there's too much water in the pot. Gently remove the orchid from the pot it came in and place it into a pot that is the same size or slightly larger. The orchid should be secure enough in the pot that it doesn't wiggle. If necessary, fill in the extra space with a mixture of 2 parts fir bark or orchid bark mix to 1 part peat moss. Do not place the pot in a secondary pot. Be sure to always clean out your pot thoroughly before planting the orchid."

Make sure your orchid has at least 1 ft (0.30 m) of the gravel mixture under it and around it. Dig a hole large enough for the orchid, plant it, then fill the empty space with the gravel mixture. Terrestrial orchids of the Pleione, Sobralia, Calanthe, Phaius and Bletia genuses can be grown in a well-drained area with a lot of shade. Alternatively, you can make a raised bed to plant your orchids into."

Within 1 year, the string will deteriorate and the orchid will cling to the tree with its roots. This method is best if you live in an area with warm temperatures and frequent rainfall. Use trees that admit some light down to the trunk, such as oaks, citrus, bottlebrush, and palms. In areas that get 6-8 hours of full sun a day, try growing a vanda orchid. In areas that don't get much full sun, grow oncidiums, phalaenopsis, and cattleyas."

Place it under a kitchen sink and run the tap for 15 seconds, then place it somewhere it can drain and dry. Watering in the morning will ensure that your orchid will have more sunlight to help it grow. If you wait until night to water it, it will be moist all night, which can lead to mildewing. Avoid over-watering by checking the soil's moisture with your finger. If the soil feels wet, wait 1 more day to water the orchid."

Apply only enough of the mixture to cover the plant; the rest can be used on other garden plants if you'd like. Remake this mixture every time you spray for bugs, as opposed to keeping it; the ingredients will break down soon after mixing with water. Keep your potted orchids off the ground, so pests can't easily crawl into them."

Weeds are any small plant, usually green, growing unwanted in the same area as your orchid. Removing the bulb or root below the weed will give you the best chance at permanently wiping out the weed. Dig under where you found the green growth until the entire root or bulb comes out."

Spray a solution of 1 part bleach to 10 parts water on the cut area and throw the infected cutting away. Cut the infected area away until there is only health tissue on the plant. Diseases can easily spread if they're left on the orchid. These diseases are spread by water. Prevent them by making sure your orchid is draining properly in loose soil, and consider moving the orchid to an area with more air circulation. Make sure that you sanitize your cutting tools after removing the infected plant material to avoid contaminating other plants."
