You\u2019ll then need to feel comfortable shingling around the fan area, though the installation process itself is relatively easy. Wall-mounted fans are meant to fit into a gable wall and for extra ease can be installed in place of an existing gable vent, which means you won\u2019t have to remove any shingles or make significant changes to your attic."
