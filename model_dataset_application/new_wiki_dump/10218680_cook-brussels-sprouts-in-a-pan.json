          "description":"Pull off some of the outer layers of leaves, because these are the generally the dirtiest part. Cut them in half lengthwise. Use a small knife to remove the stem and any blemished leaves. After peeling the sprouts, you still need to rinse the inner layers under cold water just to get rid of any leftover dirt and bacteria. A paring knife is a good tool for cutting the stem off Brussels sprouts, because it\u2019s small and gives you control in how you maneuver the Brussels sprouts\u2019 round bottoms."

        {
          "headline":"Add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of olive oil to the skillet.",
          "description":"Heat the oil over medium heat. Cut the sprouts in half and place them flat side down in a pan of olive oil. Cook on one side for 5 minutes, and then flip them and cook for 5 minutes on the other side. The flat side should look deep gold and black. Don\u2019t move the sprouts around while they\u2019re being seared. This isn\u2019t saut\u00e9ing. When searing, Brussels sprouts should cook on the flat side for an evenly distributed brown and black look. The flavor is also in the coloring, and you want them all to have a nice even flavor throughout."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Stir in butter, shallots, garlic, lemon zest and white wine.",
          "description":"Lemon zest should be from \u00bd a lemon. You should use one finely chopped garlic clove and one small finely chopped shallot. These only need to be stirred for a few moments. Adding \u20443 cup (79 mL) of dry white wine allows all the flavors in the pan to concentrate and blend together. White wine also deglazes the pan. Because white wine is also sweet, it helps to reduce Brussels sprouts natural bitterness. Sour flavors, such as lemon zest, decrease the bitterness that turns a lot of people away from Brussels sprouts."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Complete the process by adding Kosher salt and pepper to taste.",
          "description":"You should also add lemon wedges to the side of the dish to balance the seared flavor with some citrus. Squeeze the lemon juice from the wedges onto the Brussels sprouts. Salting is another wonderful way to reduce the bitter flavor in Brussels sprouts. It\u2019s the same reason people might add salt to a bad cup of coffee. For a complete meal, serve a fried egg on top of the sprouts, or pair them as a side dish with any kind of meat such as fish, pork, chicken and steak."

Leftovers should be refrigerated or frozen within 2 hours of cooking the food. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or frozen for 3 to 4 months. However, frozen leftovers tend to lose moisture and flavor when stored longer than 4 months."

You can test the pan\u2019s temperature by flicking tap water over it, and if the water gives a good sizzle, that means the pan is hot enough. For this, you need a 12 in (30 cm) cast-iron pan. Alternatively, make 2 smaller batches if you don\u2019t have a pan of that size.
