Twist your chopsticks as you pick your noodles up to wrap them around one of the sticks. Don\u2019t grab too many noodles at a time or else they may slip out of your grip. The noodles will be slippery. Keep practicing with your chopsticks until you can easily pick the noodles up. Keep your bowls only 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) apart so you don\u2019t drop anything on the table."
