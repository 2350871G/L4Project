For example, if you want to can apples, you might decide to process them as applesauce first. For peaches, you may want to peel and slice them before canning. Here is a list of techniques used to process different types of fruits for canning:\n Can sliced apples\n Can applesauce\n Can sliced peaches\n Can sliced pears\n\n  Can berry jam; this works for any type of berry\n\n Can stonefruit jam; this works for apricots, plums and peaches"

          "description":"Fruit contains a lot of acid, which acts as a natural preservative and helps the fruit keep for a long time after canning. The canning method that works best for fruit is called water bath canning. This involves placing the fruit in sanitized jars and heating the jars to a certain temperature to kill off any bacteria. Once the jars are sealed, the canned fruit lasts many months. Here's what you'll need:\nBoiling water bath canner or a large, deep saucepot with a lid and a rack to keep the jars from touching the bottom\nGlass canning jars with new lids and bands\nJar lifter"

Keep the jars hot until you use them by leaving them in the dishwasher or placing them in a pot filled with water that's hot, but not boiling. Keeping the jars hot until you use them prevents jars from breaking when you pour hot fruit inside. If you poured hot fruit into a cold jar, the glass could break."

If you're using a pot instead of a canner, place the rack inside the pot, then fill it halfway with water and bring it to a simmer. If you don't have a rack designed for home canning, you can use a cake cooling rack, or even make a rack by tying jar bands together with string and placing them on the bottom of the pot. It's essential to use a rack of some kind to prevent the jar from touching the bottom of the pot, which could cause it to overheat."

Use a ladle or funnel to fill the jar with the fruit from the recipe you prepared. Use a wet cloth to wipe off any residue that gets on the rim of the jar, then place a lid on the jar and secure it with a band. If you're canning a soft spread, like a berry or plum jam, leave \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) of headspace at the top of the jar. If you're canning whole or sliced fruit, leave \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of headspace at the top of the jar."
