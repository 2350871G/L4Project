          "description":"Hand to hand combat is inevitable in Dark souls. That\u2019s why Vitality (health) and Endurance (stamina) are the two most important stats for any player. Stamina is used for all actions by your character including striking, dodging, and blocking, as well as managing equipment load. Points into these stats early is always a safe bet. Endurance has a hard cap at 40 for stamina, meaning you won\u2019t receive any more stamina bonuses after that point. However you can continue to increase it for greater equipment load. You can increase your damage by increasing the stat with which your weapon scales, but the benefits early on will be minimal. This is best saved for later in the game."

          "description":"Stability is a rating for shields that determines how much punishment your shield can take before your guard is broken. Poise is a rating for how much you are staggered when you get hit. A higher number for these stats is always better. Having your guard broken leaves you very vulnerable to counterattack. Avoid it at all costs."

          "description":"Although optional, proper use of a shield can be an invaluable defensive option for beginners. A shield is much easier to time than dodging and some enemies may even stagger themselves when striking against it. Your stamina will regenerate faster if you do not have your shield up. This means it is best practice to raise your shield before you are hit, then lower it before the next strike, if you have time. For beginners, find a shield that has a 100% physical defense rating. Otherwise you will still take some damage, even when blocking attacks."

Neglecting to upgrade your weapons will make the game significantly more difficult. If you don\u2019t plan to use a weapon much, it may be best to save the materials for something you will use more frequently. Almost all weapons in Dark Souls are viable. If you keep your starting weapon upgraded, it can carry you through the entire game."

          "description":"Enemies inflict a lot of damage with each hit in Dark Souls and the amount negated by armor is finite. It is important to strike a good balance between equipment load and poise. Lighter armor will give less poise but a faster roll via lower equipment load."

Your equipment load is the percentage of the combined weight of your equipment compared to your burden stat, which is determined by Endurance. It is important to keep your equipment burden below 100% or you will be unable to run or or dodge roll. Lower equipment load (50% or below) will increase the length of your roll invincibility."

The best time to strike is following a heavy attack that leaves your opponent open. Your attacks are also slow, so be conservative with your attacks, lest you leave yourself with an opening as well. It may be advantageous to try and keep your distance for a bit and observe an enemy\u2019s attack patterns to determine when there are openings. Always keep an eye on your stamina when attacking."

Parries can be used once you have gained a sense for the timing of your opponent\u2019s attacks for a critical strike. Not all attacks (especially by bosses) can be parried. A missed parry will leave you open to attack. The risk is great, but so is the reward. Blocking is easier for beginners, but a well-timed dodge is a better way to get into a good striking position."
