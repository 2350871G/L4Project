If you are looking to re-tile another room to match existing tile that doesn\u2019t need replacing, see if any local flooring companies offer on-site visits to give estimates. Arrange an inspection to see if they are able to identify the existing tile so you don't have to damage a perfectly good, rare tile. Don\u2019t rely on photographs.

Avoid using too much pressure or working too fast, which may cause you to slip off target and scratch a neighboring tile. If you are removing a wall tile, raking too hard may also damage the drywall behind it. Chips and dust from tiling can be very sharp and abrasive. Wear workman\u2019s gloves and safety glasses. If you are removing wall tiles, place a towel, tarp, or sheet at the base of the wall to catch debris and protect surfaces. Once you\u2019re finished, line the surrounding tiles with painter\u2019s tape so their surface is protected. Be sure to cover their exposed sides now that the grout has been removed."
