  "text":" Freezing the Flower Make sure that you have everything that you will need lined up before you get the flower. Once you remove the flower from the plant, it starts dying immediately. You will want to be prepared to get the freezing process started as quickly as possible. Pour a very shallow amount of water into the container. Shoot for about a 1/4 inch of water (or a few centimeters). Freeze it first. That will give the top of your block of ice some space, so your flower won't be all the way at the top of it. Remove the ice from the freezer. Place your flowers in the positions you desire on the ice block. Once you have them about where you want them, put the container in the freezer, and make any final adjustments. Let the flowers freeze for a couple of hours. Because there is only a small amount of water in the container, the water will freeze quickly, locking the flower in place. Add another 1/4 inch of water. Freeze again for a couple of hours, until the flower part is frozen. Only use enough water to actually cover the entire flower. The more ice there is, the harder it will be to get the light to shine through the ice. Photographing the Flower Remove the flower from the freezer. Allow it to sit for about 10 minutes. Flip the container over. With a tap, remove the ice from the container. Place the block of ice where you want it. You can use natural light, use a flash, or continuous light. Whatever works. For example:\nPut it in, or near, a window that has fairly strong light coming through it. Put something in your sink to serve as a backdrop, like a towel. Cover it with glass. Experiment with the placement of your flashgun. In, or to the side of, the sink until you have the look you want. Put the block of ice over a white bowl (to reflect light) and experiment with that. Start with your depth of field being set at about F9 or F11. You want to have some definite depth. Adjust as needed. Adjust your ISO once you have your preferred depth of field.. Lower is better.
