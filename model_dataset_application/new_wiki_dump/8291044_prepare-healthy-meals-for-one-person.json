However, you need to be able to store those portions properly so they will freeze completely and not get freezer burn. Invest in a set of smaller storage containers that will allow you to separate food into single servings. That way you aren't constantly re-heating and re-freezing your food. You also want to be able to store sides separately so that you can mix and match, rather than having to eat the exact same meal every day for a week. Get plastic wrap and foil to seal foods properly. Putting a double layer of both plastic and foil on casseroles and other one-pot meals can prevent freezer burn."

          "description":"Some ingredients, particularly meats, fruits, and many vegetables, will taste just as good if you freeze them as they would if you ate them right after you cooked them. Others don't stand up to sub-zero temperatures. For example, cooked pasta doesn't freeze well. However, if you want spaghetti, you can make a larger batch of sauce and freeze the excess. When you want to have spaghetti, warm up a portion of the sauce and cook your noodles separately \u2013 it will only take a few minutes. Potatoes typically don't freeze well either. If you enjoy baked or mashed potatoes with your meal, you'll have to make those before you eat rather than trying to make them in advance. Creamy sauces may separate when frozen and reheated. Prevent this by adding them when you're reheating rather than freezing them with the other food. Undercook vegetables so reheating won't cause them to become too soft or mushy."

This way you're not spending as much time every day preparing your food. For example, get some English muffins, eggs, meat, and cheese. Cook your eggs and prepare six or seven breakfast sandwiches at once. This way you spend a few minutes cooking and have a hot breakfast ready every day of the week. Empanadas and burritos are another option that you can fill with meat, cheese, and vegetables for a handy meal. Once frozen, you can take these with you to work or school for a quick and convenient lunch that won't require eating out at a restaurant.

Stir-fry also works well as a one-pot meal. Take out the portion you plan to freeze before it's completely cooked, so you won't ruin the texture of the food when you reheat it at a later time. The other benefit of one-pot meals is that you reduce the work and clean-up you have to do afterwards. Cook all the ingredients in one pot or pan, then when you heat up individual servings you'll only have one plate to clean. Cook basic versions of one-pot meals, such as oatmeal, and freeze the excess. Then on a daily basis you can add different fruits or spices so you don't get bored eating the same thing every day."

If the ingredient measurements are easily divisible by two or three, you can easily reduce the recipe. For example, if you're halving a recipe that calls for two eggs, you would use one egg. Halving a recipe would be more difficult if the recipe called for three eggs. Though it could still be done, you may want to explore another option or just make the whole recipe and freeze the excess if you don't trust your math skills. If your recipe calls for a single can or package of something, you may want to measure the food in the container before dividing it, rather than just going by sight. You can save the portion you don't use by freezing it and use it later."

          "description":"Don't let complex divisions stop you from reducing a recipe \u2013 especially if it's one you really like. Memorize equivalencies for common ingredient measures so you can reduce the recipe appropriately. For example, there are 16 tablespoons in a cup and three teaspoons in one tablespoon. So if you're cutting a recipe into thirds that calls for a quarter-cup of something, you would use one tablespoon and one teaspoon. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources has a PDF table with handy measurements to use when making either one-half or one-third of a recipe. You can look at that table or download and print it at http://food.unl.edu/reducing-size-recipes-0. Dividing whole foods can be a little more difficult. For example, suppose you want to make half of a recipe that calls for one egg. There's no good way to divide an egg in half. However, you can crack the egg in a separate dish, whip it together with a fork, and then use two tablespoons of it. Save the rest in the fridge and use it for an omelet or scrambled eggs tomorrow."

When this happens, add just a tap from the container and taste-test frequently until you get the right balance. Even if you have a total amount, consider that a target. Add gradually and taste frequently until you reach a balance that works for you. It may be less \u2013 or even more \u2013 than what the recipe calls for. This is generally a good idea even if you're not reducing a recipe. Seasonings in recipes are more suggestive than they are required ingredients. Feel free to experiment with a recipe and make it the way you like it."

Baking it in the larger pan can result in the food burning or not cooking evenly. For example, if you're halving a recipe that calls for a 9 x 2 x 13-inch pan, use an 8 x 2-inch square pan or a 9 x 2-inch round pan. Overall, you want to focus on having the food be approximately the same depth as it would be in the pan the recipe calls for. If you're using a glass pan and the recipe calls for a metal pan, reduce the temperature of the oven by 25 degrees Fahrenheit."

          "description":"Just because you halve a recipe doesn't necessarily mean you should cut the time it takes to cook in half too. However, smaller quantities typically will be done five to ten minutes sooner than the full amount would have been. Don't leave your food unattended. Set a timer and check it about 10 minutes before the time given on the recipe, and then again at five minutes. For example, if the recipe calls for a casserole to bake for 20 minutes, check it after 10 minutes and then again after 15 minutes. If it isn't done after 15 minutes, continue checking it every minute. A food thermometer is a good investment, particularly if you're cooking meats, so you can know for sure when your food is cooked properly."

If you write down what you did and make notes as to whether it worked, you can replicate it later. Notes on what doesn't work can be just as valuable as notes on what did \u2013 if not more so. Write down carefully what you did and how it didn't work so that you won't repeat the same mistake. Remember that a lot of cooking is experimentation. If you don't get it right the first time, you can adjust your tactics and get it right the next time around. Your notes will help you."

For example, the USDA's ChooseMyPlate website plans seven-day and 21-day menus to ensure a variety of healthy meals over the course of the week. Planning your meals in advance also can be helpful if you plan to make a lot of something all at once and then freeze it for later.

If you've planned your recipes in advance, you also can look for coupons and specials at grocery stores near you. Try downloading an app for your phone that will help you find the best prices for certain items, particularly if they're the more expensive items on your list.

Whole grains can be good for baking your own breads or making your own oatmeal, which can be cheaper and more healthy than buying packaged or instant varieties.

The unit price of an item, typically listed next to the overall price on the grocery store shelf, will tell you what something actually costs. Food frequently is compared by the ounce. So, for example, you might have a regular-sized box of cereal that costs 12 cents per ounce. The larger, family size, on the other hand, costs 10 cents per ounce. Buy the choice that offers you the lowest price per ounce \u2013 keeping in mind that this might not always be the lowest overall price. Comparing unit prices also gives you a better idea of how much you're actually saving if you buy the \"bargain\" or \"family\" size of something. Frequently the difference is only a penny or two per ounce. If you're concerned the food might go bad before you get to it, you're probably better off getting the smaller size."

For example, if you're buying chicken, consider buying thighs. They're cheaper than chicken breasts and provide about three ounces of chicken, which is the perfect individual portion. You also can buy meat in larger packages at a lower price. Freeze what you're not going to cook immediately so you can use it later."

Start your shopping around the outside of the store, then work your way through the aisles. If you're trying to eat healthy, you probably have little use for junk food. And if you've planned ahead by building your list from ingredients you need to cook healthy meals, you won't have any junk food on your list. This means that in most cases you can avoid those center aisles altogether. Try to avoid being tempted by sale signs and other promotions. If it isn't on your list, you don't have any need for it. Don't go to the grocery store when you're hungry, or you may find yourself even more tempted by food packaged so that you can eat it right away, rather than whole foods that you have to cook. When you've purchased everything on your list, it's time to check out. If you continue to wander around the store after you've gotten everything on your list, you'll be tempted to buy other items."

Instead, use your leftovers in other recipes or with other sides so you don't get bored. For example, leftover meat and vegetables can be combined into a hearty vegetable soup or stew. You can also can throw leftovers into a tortilla and add a little sauce and cheese and give them a second life as a burrito. Try putting leftovers from two or three different meals together to make a new meal with different ingredients. Even if the sides don't seem like they'd go well together, you may be surprised.
