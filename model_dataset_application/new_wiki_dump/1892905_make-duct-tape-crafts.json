However, the quality of these videos can be hit and miss, so make sure to check out the whole video, before you prepare to make the craft. These websites often give helpful tips for making your craft. For example, in the instructions for how to make duct tape bangles, at craftsunleashed.com, it suggests ways to fold your duct tape to make sure you are completely covering the sticky parts.

Comments are typically below the craft instructions. Find out what the people who actually made the craft have to say about it. You may want to use their suggestions, to learn how to improve your duct tape craft. For example, for the beach bag craft, one commenter suggested that you add a clasp to the bag, so that it will close. In order to figure out how add a feature like the clasp, you can look at related crafts, for example, a duct tape clutch purse, with a magnet, that closed. Add an extra feature to your craft. Read the directions for a craft with the feature you want to add. For example, the magnet clutch purse directions explained how to tape magnets to a purse so that it will close. Now you can make your beach bag close. Consider making a shape to put on your finished craft. For example, you can make the anchor with an Etsy stencil and a red sheet of duct tape, if you are making the beach bag craft. However, make sure to cut shapes carefully. Cut shapes by:\nLaying a strip, or sheet, of tape flat, on the cutting surface\nPlacing a stencil, if needed, on the strip of tape\nTracing the shape on the sheet with a pen or marker\nPlacing the blade of the razor firmly onto the tape and cutting out the shape\nLifting the edge of the tape with the edge of the blade and peeling the shape away from the cutting surface. Making a Beach Bag Give yourself approximately thirty minutes. Because we are making an easier version of duct tape fabric, thirty minutes, or less, is how long this project should take. Get out your duct tape. Choose two different colors of duct tape, to create a striped look for your bag; or you can choose a single print, like the anchor print, to make your bag. Reference method one, above, for instructions on the best way to purchase duct tape. Consider choosing one darker color and one lighter color for contrast. If you want to add a shape onto the bag, buy tape to make the shape. For example, if you want to make the anchor stencil, buy red or white duct tape and use the steps in method two add the shape to your finished product. Get out your additional supplies. In addition to the standard materials detailed in method one, sharp scissors and cutting mat, for this craft you will need a:\n13 gallon, white trash bag\nYard stick or measuring tape\nPermanent marker\nLong ribbon or cord to make the strap of your bag Cut the edges off of the trash bag, then cut the seam at the bottom of the bag. This sheet of plastic will be one side of your the duct tape fabric. If need be, you can use a black trash bag if you do not have a white trash bag. The black doesn\u2019t match the beach bag look as well, but it will still work in a pinch. The white trash bag is also preferable because you can mark the outline with a sharpie that is more visible. Tape the bag to the surface you are working at. This will keep it from moving when you are working with the duct tape. Reference method one to learn about how to prepare your surface for crafting. Tape each of the four sides of your bag to your cleared off surface. Draw a rectangle on the plastic with a permanent marker. Using your yardstick or measuring tape, draw a rectangle twenty eight inches by twelve inches. Cover the surface of your rectangle with tape, sticky side down. Start with your first color of duct tape, and cut a piece, twenty eight inches long, and lay it, left to right, on the top of the long side of the plastic. Lay the next strip of tape down (your other color, if you are making stripes), slightly overlapping the first piece of tape. Don\u2019t worry about the tape being the perfect length, you will cut off the excess later. Repeat the process until the rectangle is covered. Cut out the fabric from the plastic, with scissors. Use the marker outline to help guide you, and remove the excess duct tape and plastic. Throw away the excess you remove. Cut the cord or ribbon to a desired length. Make sure not to cut the cord too short. Two and a half feet for each cord should be sufficient. The cords in this bag will work like drawstrings that tie at the two ends of the bag. You will pull up on the tied off cords from both sides of the bag and it will tighten the opening of the bag. Make the encasement for the cord. Place the fabric on table with the plastic side facing up. Position the cord along the edge of the short side of your fabric. Fold a couple of inches of fabric over the cord. Cut a long piece of tape and tape down the fold, pressing to smooth the tape down. Cut off any excess. Now the cord is encased in the bag. When the bag is made, if you pull the cord, the bag will bunch tighter. Repeat this process with the opposite, also short, side of the fabric. Once both cords are encased, fold your bag in half, so that the cords meet at the top of the bag. Seal the sides of your bag. Cut a long piece of tape, and make sure it matches the color on the bag. Place the half of the tape, vertically, down one side of the bag, and then fold the other half of the tape onto the other side of the bag, and seal the bag shut. Trim off the excess tape. Tie the two cords that lie on top of each other. On each side of the bag your cords lie on top of each other. Tie them in a double knot. Trim off the excess cord. Pull up on the ties, and your new beach bag is ready to go! Making a Duct Tape Wallet Give yourself about ten minutes. This is one of the more simple duct tape crafts to make. You can probably do this craft in less time, if you have done other duct tape crafts before. Choose a duct tape for your wallet. Get out your duct tape and a ruler. Reference method one to read about your options for purchasing duct tape. Clear your space. Make sure you have a cleared off desk or the equivalent to do make your craft. Reference method one to read more about what to do to prepare your space. Get out your supplies. Materials include: scissors, board, and a roll of the tape of your choice. Once again, method one will help you give you more specifics on the materials, if need more information. Make your duct tape fabric. Cut off four, seven inch strips of duct tape. Lay down your first strip, sticky side up. Cut off another piece of duct tape, and lay it, also sticky side up, next to the first piece, so that it slightly overlaps. Repeat until you have all four in a row. Take four more, seven inch strips of duct tape, and lay them, sticky side down, on top of the duct tape sticky duct tape, to make your fabric. Trim off excess, fold your fabric in half, hotdog style, so the long sides are touching at the top. Trim off the excess duct tape on each side, so you have straight sides. Seal the long top edges of your fabric with duct tape strips. Cut off a ten inch strip of duct tape, and cut or rip the strip in half. Take one piece, place half  of it along the top of one of the sides, and fold it over. Cut off the edges. Repeat the process with the other side. Sealing the top and bottom will give the wallet a cleaner look. Make enough fabric for four credit card pockets. Put two on each side of the wallet. To do this:\nCut three, fourteen inch strips of duct tape. Take two of the fourteen inch strips and stick them together, sticky sides touching, to make a long strip of duct tape fabric. Seal each of the long edges of fabric with tape. Lengthwise, rip the third piece of tape down the middle. Take one of the two pieces, lay it on one long side of the fabric, so that it halfway covers the fabric. Fold the tape down and smooth it, to make the edge. Repeat on the other side. Fold your wallet to see where you will put the credit card pockets. Fold your original fabric in half, hotdog style, or so the long sides touch. Then, fold the fabric again in half, hamburger style, so the short ends touch, to see where the credit cards pockets will go. Measure the pockets and cut. Get a credit card and your wallet, folded hot dog or lengthwise. Lay the card on the inside of the wallet and measure a piece pocket fabric big enough to hold cards. Make a mark on the fabric and cut it to size. Use that same measurement for the three other pockets. Measure the fabric so that it is slightly longer than the size of the credit card, so they will fit. Make sure the pieces of fabric you cut for your credit cards are not so long that they stick out of the sides of the wallet. Also see to it that you can tape the pocket in the middle, as well. Secure the pockets with tape. Lay the pieces of fabric in place where you want the credit cards, on the inside of your wallet. Cut twelve strips of tape, a few inches long, to secure the pockets. Tape the bottom and two sides of the four credit card holders. Tape the sides of your wallet close. First, fold the wallet in half, again, lengthwise (hotdog style). Make sure that the pockets are faced out. Take two strips of tape, a little longer than the short side of your wallet, and seal the short edges that are touching, on both sides of your wallet. Trim off the excess tape. Fold your wallet in half. You have your completed wallet!",
