Buy fresh carrots at a farmer's market near you, or think about growing your own. If neither option is possible, get them at a produce shop or in your grocery store. Do not use frozen carrots. Fresh, raw carrots will taste and cook better. Look for dark orange carrots for the best health benefits. Darker carrots are higher in vitamin A."
