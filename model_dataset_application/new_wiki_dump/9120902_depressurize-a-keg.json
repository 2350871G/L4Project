  "text":" Pressing Down on the Ball Pin Bring your keg outside. Always depressurize your keg outside. A little beer will usually spurt out of the keg during the process. Due to the mess, it's a good idea to go outside and place the keg on a surface, such as pavement, that can be easily cleaned. Locate the ball pin. Look at the top of the keg. At the center of the keg, there should be a rounded, circular metal pin stuck in the opening of the keg. This is the ball pin, that you will need to press down on to depressurize the keg. Press a flat edge screwdriver on the ball pin. Take your flathead screwdriver. Gently press it against the ball pin. Very gently press the pin downward until you hear a sizzling sound, like when you open a bottle of soda. Pressure is being released from the keg. Hold down the ball pin until all the pressure is released. Continue to press your screwdriver against the pin. Leave the screwdriver in place until the keg stops making the sizzling sound. Once the sound stops, the pressure has been released. You can then remove and discard the ball pin. Removing the Ring and Tube Pry the retaining ring up with your screwdriver. A small metallic ring, called the retaining ring, will be circling the area outside where the ball pin was. Slip the head of your flathead screwdriver underneath the ring. Pry the ring upwards using your screwdriver so a portion of the ring detaches from the keg. Pull out the ring using your pliers. Take a pair of needle nose pliers. Grasp onto the portion of the ring you loosened with the screwdriver. Use the pliers to pull the ring off the keg. You can then discard the ring. Move the inner tube counterclockwise with a hammer. There will be a tube found underneath the ball pin and ring. Take a hammer and hook the claw onto one of the grooves on the side of the tube. Turn the tube counterclockwise. Pull out the inner tube.

This is especially important if you're depressurizing a full keg. Kegs will spurt out beer during the process, which can get on your clothes. Always wear old clothes you don't mind dirtying when working with a keg. Lean away from the keg when working. To reduce the likelihood of getting beer on yourself, lean away from the keg when working. With a full keg, you may want to turn the keg on its side.
