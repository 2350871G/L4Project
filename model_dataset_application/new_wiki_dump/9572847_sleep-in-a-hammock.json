The deep curve will also ensure the hammock fabric does not become too loose, causing you to get caught up in the material while you sleep."

  "text":" Selecting the Hammock Get a hammock made of nylon. Look for hammocks made of parachute nylon, as they will be the most comfortable to lay in for a long period of time.
