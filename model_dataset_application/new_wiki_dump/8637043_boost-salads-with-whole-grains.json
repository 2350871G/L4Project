          "description":"Quinoa is an ancient seed from South America that has recently surged in popularity. It can be found in many supermarkets and health food stores, and you may frequently see it listed on restaurant menus. Quinoa is one of the few plant-based foods that contains complete proteins, which means it contains all nine of the essential amino acids. Add a cup of cooked quinoa to your salad to add 8 grams of protein to your meal. Combine cooked quinoa, spinach, olive oil, and your favorite vegetables for a nutrient-dense, protein-filled salad."

          "description":"Farro is another ancient grain that originated in the Fertile Crescent in Egypt. This grain has a chewy texture and an earthy flavor, and it is full of fiber, zinc, and magnesium. This grain is also an excellent source of plant-based protein, which is a great for vegetarians. Toss cooked farro with kale, pine nuts, carrots, and a lemon vinaigrette for a nutty, satisfying side salad."

          "headline":"Incorporate more fiber with barley and amaranth.",
          "description":"Add some extra fiber to your salad by mixing in some of your favorite whole grains with fresh vegetables. Whole grains are an excellent source of fiber, which can help promote digestive health and prevent heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. A cup of cooked amaranth (200 g), a nutty grain from South America, has 5 grams of fiber, while barley packs 13 grams of fiber per cup (200 g). Mix amaranth with black beans and a dash of cayenne pepper to add a Southwestern kick to your favorite garden salad. Try mixing barley with a sprinkling of feta, tomatoes, olives, and greens to make a delicious Mediterranean salad."

          "headline":"Experiment with other grains.",
          "description":"Browse your local specialty food shop or an online vendor and look for grains that are less common. Kamut, for example, is a nutritious whole grain with a buttery taste. Freekeh is a smoky, chewy grain that is high in protein and fiber. Mix one of these grains into your favorite salad to discover what flavors and textures you enjoy."

          "headline":"Swap bacon bits for freekeh.",
          "description":"Processed meats like bacon add a salty, smoky flavor to a salad, but they are high in fat and sodium. Try mixing in some cooked freekeh next time you are tempted to add bacon to your salad. This grain has a smoky aroma and taste and is full of fiber and B vitamins, making it a healthy addition to any salad."

Toss cooked whole wheat pasta, quinoa, or bulgur with a traditional mayonnaise-based pasta salad, and pack it with fresh vegetables, grilled chicken, and a lite vinaigrette for a lower calorie option. Swap refined pasta with whole grains in a bean salad. Toss farro or brown rice with cannellini beans, basil, and parmesan cheese for a fresh and nutrient-dense side dish."

When buying grains from your local grocery store or specialty food store, make sure the package is secured and sealed. Also take a moment to check the expiration date. When buying in bulk, make sure the grains look and smell fresh. Amaranth, for example, will smell and taste bitter if it is not fresh. Brown rice that has gone bad will have an odor and will look oily."

          "headline":"Store grains in sealed container in a pantry.",
          "description":"To keep your grains fresh and safe from pests, store them in a sealed container. Keep the containers away from heat, light, and water on a pantry shelf. Barley, amaranth, farro, kamut, oats, and quinoa can be kept for a year or more if they are sealed properly and kept away from sunlight. Grains like oats and wild rice can last for several years if properly sealed and stored. Buckwheat has a shorter shelf life of 2 to 3 months."

        {
          "headline":"Review the cooking tips.",
          "description":"Most whole grains can be prepared in a pot of boiling water, but some whole grains take longer to prepare than others. Be sure to review the labels on your whole grain products to see how long they take to prepare. Quinoa, bulgur, and oats typically take 10 to 15 minutes to prepare. Whole oats or steel-cut oats, buckwheat, barley, and brown rice can be boiled in water for about 40 minutes. Denser, chewier whole grains like farro, wild rice, and spelt may need to boil for 50 to 75 minutes."
