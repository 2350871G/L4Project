Avoid removing the white pith, as this is very bitter. Transfer the zest to a small ceramic or metal bowl. You can also use a sharp knife to zest the lemons if you don\u2019t have a vegetable peeler. You can use any type or combination of citrus zest in place of the lemon, such as a combination of orange and grapefruit."

This will help the citrus to release its oils. After five minutes of muddling, set the bowl aside and let the zest marinate in the sugar for an hour. The citrus oil and sugar mixture liquid this will produce is called oleo-saccharum, which was often used in cocktails in the nineteenth century."
