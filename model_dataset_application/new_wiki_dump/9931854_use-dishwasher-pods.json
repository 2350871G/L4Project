Avoid adding items that are made of cast iron, crystal, plastic, copper or nonstick pans, and insulated mugs into the dishwasher as these might be ruined by the heat and detergent. Items that are not dishwasher-safe often have a warning on their packaging or right on the product, so check the product before you add it to your load.
