Leave out scraps of meat or bones that haven\u2019t been picked clean in the areas where you want to attract roaches. Remember that meat will rot, which will produce both strong smells and bacteria. Do not place it in areas where pets or children will be able to access it, and keep it out of spaces where the odor may become offensive. Place scraps in isolated areas such as cabinets, garages, or other spaces where it will be easy to round up your roaches."

A trail of sugar can be particularly helpful when you\u2019re looking to bring roaches through an extended path, such as along the length of a garden or lawn. If you are looking to keep a roach problem under control, throw away any packages of sugar where you\u2019ve found roaches. Be sure to seal any new packages in airtight containers."

          "description":"Fruits are a natural source of sugar, and can be just as helpful in attracting roaches as the kitchen staple. Use fruit scraps such as rinds, peels, cores, and other discarded bits to attract roaches. If you are looking to bring roaches into your yard or another outdoor space, you can bury fruit scraps just below the topsoil. This will attract roaches but keep decaying matter hidden from pets, children, and neighbors."

Build a compost pile or use a composting bin to break down your trash into roach-attracting mulch. Composting means committing to regular pile maintenance, including turning and watering. Composting is subsequently the best choice for when you want to attract roaches every season or over an extended period of time.

If you are keeping them in a terrarium, get rock shelters and other hiding areas from the fish and small pets sections of the pet store. If you opt to keep your roaches in a terrarium, get them a strong plastic or glass space that is at least 6 times bigger than the area your roaches occupy. It should have very small air holes, as roaches can escape from even thin slits in their tanks. Place moist soil at the bottom of the tank, and provide them with hiding places made from tree bark, flat stones, and chunks of wood. Egg cartons and small cardboard pieces also make good hiding places."
