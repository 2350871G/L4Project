Therefore, instead of sucking on your jawbreaker right away, you\u2019ll have to lick it while holding it, sort of like a lollipop without the stick. Eventually, the jawbreaker should get small enough to fit into your mouth. Jawbreakers have multiple layers that are typically different colours. As you lick a jawbreaker, your tongue will likely be stained with the colour of the layer your licking. Actual studies have been conducted that determined it takes about 1,000 licks to completely eat an average-sized jawbreaker!"

          "description":"If you have a jawbreaker that fits completely into your mouth, don\u2019t try to bite it right away. Jawbreakers are extremely hard and you could injure your jaw or even break a tooth. Avoid biting or chewing on the jawbreaker until it\u2019s really small and soft. Hard candy is one of the most common things on which kids can choke. Be very careful when sucking on a jawbreaker that you don\u2019t also perform any activities that may cause you to suddenly inhale or swallow whatever is in your mouth (e.g., riding your bike, skateboarding, rollerblading, playing sports, etc. )."

          "description":"For a jawbreaker that started off the size of a baseball, it should be ready to bite or chew once it\u2019s small enough to fit in your mouth. For a jawbreaker that started off small, you may need to suck on it to make it soft before you attempt to bite into it. Be careful when you first attempt to bite into a jawbreaker, you don\u2019t want to damage your teeth. Try biting it with your back teeth (molars) gently to see if it\u2019s soft enough. If not, keep sucking."

Place your jawbreaker into a plastic freezer bag (or a plastic bag made of thicker plastic). Put the jawbreaker (in the bag) onto a hard surface that cannot be damaged, like a cement floor, paving stones, or a sidewalk. Then take a kitchen mallet and hit the jawbreaker until it\u2019s broken into smaller pieces. If a kitchen mallet isn\u2019t strong enough, try using a hammer instead.

Eventually, the water will make the various layers of the jawbreaker soft enough to bite, chew, or lick off without a lot of effort. Once you\u2019ve removed one layer of the jawbreaker using this method, you may need to soak it in warm water again in order to soften the next layer."

Set the timer on the microwave for about 10 minutes at a time and turn it on. Check to see how melted the jawbreaker is after 10 minutes and continue to microwave it if it\u2019s not melted. Melting a jawbreaker may turn it into a liquid substance, or it may just make the jawbreaker softer. Either way, let the jawbreaker cool down before biting into it or putting the pieces in your mouth."
