          "description":"Take a few moments to remove all potential obstacles from your path. Grab a trash bag and gather up any empty food and beverage containers, paper trash, dirty clothes and linens, and unwanted belongings you come across. When you\u2019re done, place the trash outside for pickup. Check with the people you live with before moving or throwing away any of their things. Try not to get sidetracked by sentimentality. If an item hasn\u2019t served you within the last 6 months, it\u2019s probably no great loss to get rid of it.Tip: Oversized leaf bags are ideal for speedy decluttering. Not only do leaf bags have an enormous capacity, they\u2019re also designed to resist tears and ruptures."

Going from high to low like this will help ensure that the dust drifts downwards, making it easy to vacuum up later. Ditch the dusting spray in favor of a cling-duster or damp cloth so you don\u2019t have to spend the rest of eternity spraying, wiping, and buffing every surface in your living room. Textured cloths dampened with warm water are especially useful for dealing with dirty or sticky patches that have accumulated dust."

When you reach the entrance, move over, reset, and go over the next strip. Continue in this fashion until you reach the opposite side of the room. Always work backwards in the direction of the doorway to avoid treading back over a section you just cleaned. Use a hand vacuum on upholstered furniture and other surfaces you can\u2019t suction easily with your floor vacuum. No matter what order you decide to perform your other cleaning tasks in, save the floors for last. They\u2019re the surface most likely to get dirty as a result of dusting and other activities, as well as constant foot traffic."

Rearrange the contents of the coffee table, fluff the pillows on the sofa, square stacks of books and magazines with their display surfaces, and remove unused odds and ends from view. Perform a quick walk-through to spot out-of-place items and messes. Imagine that you\u2019re seeing the room for the first time. Visitors will almost always pass through the living room on their way to other parts of the house, so it\u2019s important to make sure that it looks good at a glance."
