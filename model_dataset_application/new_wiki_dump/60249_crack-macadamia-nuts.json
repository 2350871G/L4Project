Vise grips are common tools available at any hardware store. If you love macadamia nuts and plan to shell them often, it's worth buying a vise grip for this specific purpose (though you'll probably find other uses for it as well). Be sure the hammer has a flat end, rather than a round one. You'll need to exert force evenly on the nutshells. If you don't have an iron bar, any tough, metal surface will do. Other hard surfaces like marble, glass, concrete or wood could get damaged by the pounding, so make sure you're working over metal."

If you live near volcanic rock, you'll likely find some with holes just the right size. If you don't live near volcanic rock, locate some limestone or shale with natural, small holes in it. Some people have found success using a crack in the sidewalk; be careful, though, since you could damage the sidewalk with this method."
