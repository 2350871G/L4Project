  "text":" Prepping the Lamb Buy lamb stew meat, rather than ground lamb. It may come pre-cut into strips or cubes. Dice it into one-inch (2.5cm) cubes if it is in larger strips. Make sure to use a non-wooden cutting board so it can be effectively sanitized after use. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 Celsius).  Place your Dutch oven on the stovetop. Turn the burner to medium heat. Add one tbsp. (15ml) of olive oil. Place the cubes of lamb in the heated Dutch oven. Brown them just until the surface is no longer pink. Remove the cubes with a slotted spoon and set aside in a bowl. Prepping Vegetables Trim the ends off the celery, onions and carrots. Peel the carrots. Chop the celery stalks, carrots and onions into rough sections. For a hearty stew, make sure they are about 1 inch (2.5cm) in size. Larger vegetables will keep their consistency better when heated. Consider peeling and cubing four small potatoes if you want an even heartier stew. You could also use turnips, parsnips or rutabagas in place of potatoes. Add two more tbsp. (30ml) of olive oil to the Dutch oven. Add your vegetables and stir them with a wooden spoon. Add the chopped fresh rosemary and fresh thyme.  Fry the vegetables and spices for 10 minutes. Loosen the browned lamb bits from the bottom of the pan as you heat the vegetables. Cooking the Lamb Stew Add your all-purpose flour and meat. Stir for two minutes, until everything is well coated with flour. Add the stock and the can of diced tomatoes. You can also replace half of the stock with dry red wine for a brighter color and richer flavor. For a Guinness lamb stew, replace half or all the stock with Guinness stout beer. Season with a tsp. of salt and one-fourth tsp. of fresh ground black pepper. Cover your Dutch oven. Place it in the oven. Check your stew after one hour. If the meat and vegetables are tender, you can remove it from the oven. If they are still crisp, leave it in the oven for a half hour to one hour. Finished. ",
