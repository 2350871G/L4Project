          "description":"If you want to use baking soda as a deodorizer, it's a good idea to soak it in a baking soda solution overnight. This gives the baking soda time to really go to work getting tough smells out of your laundry. It works well for clothes, towels and other items that that are smokey, musty or sweaty. Mix a cup of baking soda with a gallon of water. Pour it into a bucket. Add your clothes to the bucket. Give them a swirl to make sure they get completely soaked. Top them off with more water if necessary. Let them soak overnight. They'll be ready to launder the next day."

Allow it to fill completely before continuing. If you're washing clothes that smell musty, hot water will be most effective at removing smells. Musty smells are normally caused by mold spores. Hot water will kill the spores. Cold water should be used for delicates and colorful items."

For an extra-large load of laundry, you can add up to a cup of baking soda. Adding a cup of white vinegar will enhance the baking soda's deodorizing effects.

Even on a cold day in winter, you can dry your clothes outside. Just choose a place that gets plenty of sun. If you'd prefer not to dry your clothes outside, use the dryer instead. When the dry cycle is finished, smell your clothes to see whether they need to be treated again. If they come out of the dryer still smelling musty, choose a sunny day to wash them again and hang out them out to dry."

Baking soda paste is best used on fabrics that don't require dry cleaning. You'll have to rinse it away when you're finished, so the clothes will get wet. Baking soda paste works well to remove stains caused by oil, grease, dirt, food, and many other substances."

If the stain is on sturdy clothing, you can scrub it using an old toothbrush. Scrub the baking soda into the stain to make sure it can treat all of the fibers. This method is fine to use on denim and thick cotton. Don't scrub the baking soda into delicate fabric. Silk, satin and other thin fabrics could warp when scrubbed."
