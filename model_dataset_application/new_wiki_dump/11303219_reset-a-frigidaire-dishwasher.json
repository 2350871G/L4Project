While there are a variety of different Frigidaire error codes starting with a lowercase \u201ci,\u201d codes i50, i60, and iC0 all indicate something wrong with your dishwasher\u2019s system overall.

Resetting the power to the dishwasher usually alleviates these issues. There are other \u201ci\u201d related errors including i10, i20, i30, i40, and iF0, but all of these pertain to leakage and drainage issues instead of a system failure. These can be fixed by checking the drain hose."

This error will appear any time the amount of power feeding the dishwasher drops or cuts out completely. Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see this particular code, as power failures have many causes, such as power outages.
