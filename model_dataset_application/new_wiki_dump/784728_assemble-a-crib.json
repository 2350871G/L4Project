Most cribs will include a headboard, footboard, rails (the long sides of the crib; one rail is usually a drop rail, meaning that it can lower so that you can access your baby easily), some kind of mattress support (can be simply a board or can be a board with springs) and a mattress. It may also have two long thin side boards as support between the headboard and footboard, especially if both rails can move up and down (drop rails)."

This is especially true for secondhand cribs although you should also check the condition of new cribs to make sure they are safe for your baby. If you see any damage such as splintering, mold, peeling paint, sharp corners or dampness then you will want to test your pieces carefully and perhaps obtain a new crib. Damaged pieces have the possibility of breaking, potentially harming your baby. You should also make sure that the spacing between the slats is no wider than 2 3/8 inches (6 cm)."

If you do not have instructions for your crib, perhaps if you lost them or are using a secondhand crib, often you will be able to find the manufacturer\u2019s instructions online. Go the the website of the manufacturer and search for your crib model to try to obtain these. If you still cannot find the instructions then it should not be hard to figure out how to assemble the crib. Since most cribs have the same basic pieces it shouldn't be difficult to figure out how to assemble the crib."

Cribs that have long thin side boards (usually those with drop rails on each side) will attach differently. For these, insert the hardware of the side board into the headboard and footboard. If there is a location to screw these pieces together then you should do so. For newborns you will want the base of the crib at the highest level so you would attach the brackets or side rails at this level. Older babies will need a lower crib base."

Sometimes your stationary rail will not have dowels but rather attach only by screws. In this case use your Phillips screwdriver to attach these screws to the rail.

This is what the mattress will be resting on so it is very important that this be secure. Slide it into the appropriate height and attach to the headboard and footboard using either screws, nuts and bolts or another type of fastener, depending on your particular crib. If your crib is new you may need to attach some parts such as brackets to the mattress support before attaching it to the headboard and footboard. For newborns attach the mattress support at the highest possible height. Older babies will need slightly more space and thus the mattress support should be placed lower, depending on the age of your baby. There will usually be a manufacturer sticker showing which side faces down on the mattress support. If you have a crib with two drop rails then you will attach the mattress support before attaching either of the sides.
