          "description":"You have probably heard the famous saying that \u201cbreakfast is the most important meal of the day,\u201d and it\u2019s true! That is because when you wake up, you likely haven\u2019t eaten for 8 to 10 hours. Your blood sugar is low, and so are your energy levels. You need to \u201cbreak\u201d the \u201cfast\u201d within one hour of waking up. A healthy breakfast will jump start your metabolism and your day, but waiting too long to eat can actually slow you down."

          "description":"Typical breakfast choices (such as a bagel with cream cheese or toast with jam) can give you some quick energy, but they will spike your blood sugar and leave you to crash. This can lead to insulin resistance, plus it will leave you feeling hungry again soon. Stay away from white bread and sweets in the morning. You'll want to stay away from donuts, waffles, pancakes, and white toast. Opt for 100% whole wheat toast instead. Watch out for added sugar in oatmeal or breakfast cereals. Refrain from adding sugar (or sweetened creamer) to your coffee."

          "description":"Instead, you need to eat a balanced breakfast that includes complex carbohydrates, protein, and fat at the same time. This nourishes you, and gets your metabolism rolling. Good sources of protein include eggs, plain Greek yogurt, beans, chicken, or fish. Your carbohydrates should come from fruits, veggies, and whole grains. Good sources of healthy fats include avocados, eggs, coconut oil, nuts, and seeds. A veggie omelet (especially one cooked in coconut oil) is a great example of a balanced breakfast with carbs, protein, and healthy fats."

Add some healthy fat to your meal to rev your metabolism and feel full. However, keep in mind that there may already be fat in your breakfast from things like yogurt, milk, and breakfast sausage."
