          "description":"Don\u2019t Starve has this unique mechanics where you\u2019ll have to watch three different gauges rather than just one or two. The three gauges are found on the upper right part of your screen and are thusly labeled Hunger (represented by a stomach), Health (represented by a heart), and Sanity (represented by a brain). These three determine the fine line between life and death, and must be monitored closely."

          "headline":"Keep a close watch on your Hunger meter.",
          "description":"Your Hunger meter is constantly draining throughout the day, and it\u2019s possible to die of starvation just before the second day if you don\u2019t keep an eye on it and keep feeding your character, since an empty Hunger gauge means you start taking damage on your Health gauge. You can find Carrots lying on the ground and there are plenty of Berry Bushes scattered in the game, which would serve as your main source of food for the first few days. You can harvest them by left-clicking (PC) or pressing the X button (console) on the Carrot or Bush, and you can eat them by right-clicking the item in your hotbar (the bar on the bottom part of the screen, which also serves as your main inventory) or scroll to it with your right analog stick and press the right direction button (console). Ideally, you should feed your character 5 Berries or Carrots\u2019 worth of food a day, but your character generally can last up to two days before starving to death. Most foods have bigger bonuses or have less penalties when cooked over the campfire, especially Meat items. You can cook your food by selecting your item and then going to your campfire and left-clicking it (PC) or pressing X (console)."

          "headline":"Check your Health.",
          "description":"Your Health is a little easier to keep an eye on since it\u2019s affected by things like getting hit by monsters, being set on fire, freezing, and especially starving. The lower your Health gauge, the closer you are to dying, and an empty one means definite death. Health can be recovered in many ways, such as eating cooked food, using Spider Glands and making healing materials, such as Healing Salves. Spider Glands sometimes drop from slain Spiders and can be consumed the same way as food, though you can\u2019t cook it. Once you acquire a Science Machine, you can craft a Healing Salve with it through the Survival tab, represented by a looped rope icon in the Crafting menu. Healing Salves cost 2 Ashes (obtained from extinguished Campfires), 1 Rock (found scattered in the world or mined from Boulders), and 1 Spider Gland."

          "description":"Your Sanity gauge may be a little less dangerous when it lowers compared to the other two gauges, but lower Sanity levels will bring about some aesthetic changes, and Shadow Creatures will start appearing. At the the lowest levels, the screen turns dim with red cracks, and the Shadow Creatures will become aggressive and start attacking you. Unless you feel like slaying some Shadows, which can be dangerous at the start of things or if you\u2019re low on resources, try and keep this gauge a bit high. Picking flowers, which yields Petals, is a great way to maintain high Sanity this early in the game, and you can create a Garland with 12 Petals on the Clothing tab (the green hat icon) on the lower portion of the crafting bar at the lefthand side of your screen."

Do NOT give in to the temptation\u2014everything can and will kill you unless you\u2019re very prepared. Until you make the Science Machine at the very least, actively seeking and attacking things with only your axe is only going to get you killed, and even when you\u2019re not trying to do anything, you\u2019ll still die anyways if you literally don\u2019t keep an eye on your character."

To make an axe, you first need a Flint and a Twig. Once you get those, click the Tool tab, represented by a symbol that looks like a crossed axe and pickaxe on the left-hand side of the screen, then at the top of the list that appears is the axe you\u2019ll need.

It costs 2 Twigs and 2 Flints, and its recipe is located just below the axe in the Tool tab. It\u2019s a bit less durable than an axe, so don\u2019t go using it as a weapon. Instead, use it for its main purpose: breaking down large rocks into smaller rocks. Like with the Axe, simply select your tool, go up to a Boulder and start mining! You will need all the rocks you can gather later on, and if you\u2019re lucky enough to find a boulder with yellow streaks in them, you\u2019ll be rewarded with some Gold, which you can use to make your Science Machine\u2014this lets you make even more things to help your survival!"

Without a light source, creatures will constantly attack you and greatly reduce your Health and Sanity with each hit. You can make multiple Campfires as long as you have enough resources.
