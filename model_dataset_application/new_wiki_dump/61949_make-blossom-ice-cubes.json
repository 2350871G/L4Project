Fill a bowl with cool water and carefully dip the flowers in to rinse them clean. Set them out on a clean towel to dry for 30 minutes to an hour. It\u2019s especially important to rinse the flowers if you\u2019ve picked them yourself. If you\u2019ve purchased edible flowers for a store or website, they\u2019ve likely already been rinsed. However, it\u2019s a good idea to rinse them yourself to be sure that all of the dirt is removed."

Heat the water on the stove at high heat until it comes to a boil, and then allow the water to boil for 2 to 3 minute. The amount of water that you\u2019ll need to boil depends on how many ice cubes you plan to make. Add water to the tray until they\u2019re full and dump it directly into the saucepan to ensure that you have enough."

Rinse the tray with cool water and dishwashing soap, and wipe out each compartment with a clean kitchen towel or piece of paper towel. Silicone ice trays are usually the best option when making blossom ice cubes. It\u2019s easier to remove the cubes from the tray without breaking them because the tray is flexible. If possible, use a tray that has larger compartments. If your finished ice cubes are large, they\u2019ll melt more slowly in drinks."
