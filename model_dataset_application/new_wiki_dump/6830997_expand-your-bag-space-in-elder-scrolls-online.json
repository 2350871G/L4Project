The mount is not only used to reduce travel time, it is also used to increase your storage space! Each mount storage space upgrade will increase your total storage space by one.

This is why it's extremely important to log on daily and upgrade the storage space at first, because it takes around 60 days to reach the maximum level of storage, without upgrading anything else. Even though each upgrade costs 250 gold, it's still cheaper than personal inventory upgrades after a while."

Pick a class that you may want to play after a while, and log on each day on this character as well, to upgrade the mount. This will provide you with a lot of extra bag spaces that you can use if you keep the second character next to your stash, and simply move items into his or her inventory."
