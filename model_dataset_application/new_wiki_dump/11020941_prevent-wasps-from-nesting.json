When you find a potential entry point, repair it by replacing the damaged materials or patching it with silicone caulk, wood putty, or a similar sealant. It\u2019s important to also seal other structures and objects that wasps might attempt to make a nest in, such as tool sheds, hollow planters, and overturned flower pots.Warning: Don\u2019t assume that any crack or crevice is too small for a wasp to infiltrate. The industrious insects can set up camp in even the tiniest spaces."

          "description":"Certain types of wasps (yellow jackets, in particular) build their nests in the ground. Just like you did with the structure of your home, perform a thorough inspection of your yard area, keeping an eye out for small holes or tunnels. Plug these openings with dirt or sand and pack the material down tight to keep your turf off-limits to future intruders. This step will be especially important if you have dogs or other pets at home that like to dig. Never attempt to \u201csmoke out\u201d an underground wasp\u2019s nest by filling it with flammable liquids. Not only is there no guarantee that this will solve the problem, it also presents an enormous fire hazard, and could have devastating consequences."

          "description":"Garbage cans, recycling bins, compost piles and other receptacles containing traces of food or moisture are also popular nesting sites for wasps. The best way to guarantee your waste containers aren\u2019t subject to a wasp invasion is to double-check that their lids are clamped down securely every time you put something in them. Make it a point to replace receptacles with holes, gaps, or ill-fitting lids as soon as you notice them. If you continue to have an issue with wasps swarming around your garbage can or recycling bin, consider moving these containers to an indoor area, such as a garage or shed."

The longer you wait, the more likely traveling wasps are to pick up the scent and move in for a closer look. If you\u2019re unlucky,\nCover your dishes with lids, heavy towels, or plastic wrap before and after eating, and serve beverages in wide-mouthed, open containers to avoid unknowingly gulping down curious wasps."

If you have fruit trees on your property, do a daily walk-by during the growing season to look for fallen fruit that\u2019s begun to rot. Scoop what you find into a plastic bag, then tie off the bag and place it in a sealed waste container. If you\u2019re in the habit of composting fruit and vegetable scraps, bury them under other less attractive materials so that wasps can\u2019t get to them."

Use a broom or similar long-handled tool to dislodge the nest from the structure it\u2019s clinging to, then throw it away or step on it to break it up completely. Disrupting a new nest while the queen wasp is away will discourage her from returning and trying again. Wasp\u2019s nests often resemble an inverted umbrella or balloon, with honeycombed egg cells constructed from a gray, papery material. It\u2019s a good idea to put on long-sleeved clothing, closed-toes shoes, thick gloves, and a protective head cover of some sort anytime you know you\u2019ll be venturing near a wasp\u2019s nest."
