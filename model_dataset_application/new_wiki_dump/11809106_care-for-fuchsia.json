          "description":"Stick your finger 1 inch (2.5 cm) into the soil to feel for moisture. If it feels dry or if you rub your fingers together and see bits of dry soil flaking off, it's time for a good watering. If it's damp, wait 12 to 24 hours before checking the soil again. Daily watering is especially important during hot summer months. Most fuchsias like to be watered every day, but under or over-watering can cause the leaves to wilt so it's wise to check the soil first. Hanging baskets dry out faster than standing pots, so you may need to test the soil twice a day (especially on hot or dry days)."

Keeping pouring until you notice water dribbling out of the bottom of the pot. The goal is to keep the soil evenly moist but not sopping wet. If you don't see water coming out of the drainage holes, they may be clogged or the soil may not be draining properly (in which case, you should re-pot the plant)."

          "description":"Once summer is over, start watering your fuchsia plant every other day or just twice a week. Always test the soil with your finger first\u2014if it's bone dry, go ahead and water it. If it's even the slightest bit damp, wait another day and check again. Withholding water in the fall will prepare the plant for winter dormancy so it can reenergize and grow beautiful blooms in the spring!"

          "headline":"Limit your waterings to 8  fl oz (240 mL) every 3 to 4 weeks in the winter.",
          "description":"Let the soil get relatively dry starting in mid-November to early March (the exact months will vary depending on where you live). A good rule of thumb is to water it with 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water every 3 weeks or each month, but you can also feel the soil with your finger to see if it's bone dry. If it is, go ahead and water it and wait another 3 to 4 weeks before watering it again. The plant will be in its dormant phase during the winter and your job is to make sure the soil doesn't get dusty-dry\u2014a little dry is okay."

          "description":"Use a fertilizer with equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium\u2014a 20-20-20 or 16-16-16 blend is perfect. The amount of fertilizer you need to use depends on the size of the pot, but you should always read the instructions on the package. For instance, if you're fertilizing a 12 in (30 cm) pot, you might use 7 drops of liquid fertilizer for each 33 fluid ounces (980 mL) of water or sprinkle 3 to 4 tsp (15 to 20 g) of granular fertilizer on top of the soil. If your plant is outside, stop fertilizing it 2 weeks before you bring it inside for the colder months. Bone meal also makes an excellent fertilizer for fuchsia. You can buy it at any garden supply store."

Fuchsias can handle direct lighting but hot afternoon sunlight may burn the leaves."

If it's inside, put it in a non-drafty area away from fans or vents. Strong winds can dry out the plant too quickly. And if it\u2019s hot enough outside, warm winds can cause heat-stress."

Depending on where you live, late spring and early fall are good times to give your fuchsia some time outside. Temperatures over 76\u00baF (24\u00baC) will stop the plant from growing their beautiful blooms. If your fuchsia is outside, it can tolerate overnight temperatures ranging 50 to 60\u00baF (10 to 15\u00baC)."

Use garden shears to cut off dead or broken shoots at a 45-degree angle just above the knobby nodes. Cutting at a 45-degree angle helps prevent disease and allows the plant to take in more moisture and nutrients.

Keep clipping the stems above the nodes and clip off any dead limbs you see until the plant is about half the size it used to be. It may seem like overkill to cut the plant back by half, but what remains will be a solid backbone to spur new growth in the spring.

Quarantine the diseased plant so the fungal disease doesn't jump to nearby fuchsias. Other signs of fuchsia rust include dropped or deformed leaves or circular patches of yellowing on the tops of the leaves. If you only notice a few leaves that show signs of fuchsia rust, pick those off right away and keep and eye on the rest of the plant for the next few days.
