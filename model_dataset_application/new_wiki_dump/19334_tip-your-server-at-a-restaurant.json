          "description":"The baseline for how much you should tip your server in the United States is at least 15 percent when eating in a restaurant. However, this is generally considered the minimum. If you leave anything less than this, it\u2019s likely the server will be very offended. Be aware that tipping only the basic 15 percent is considered a statement that the service was just average or OK to some servers. Consider tipping more if you thought the service was better than average. Consider tipping 20 percent if the service was good, 25 percent if the service was great, and 30 percent if the service was exceptional. Some people believe you should also tip $2 for each person at the table if that amount is higher than the tip percentage would be."

          "description":"Some people struggle to figure out how much 15 percent is exactly. You can use an easy math shortcut to determine the amount you need to leave! To figure out the tip, you will need to do a simple mathematical equation. Some suggest rounding the bill up to the nearest $10 before figuring out the tip on the total. Move the decimal point to the left on your final bill amount. That\u2019s 10 percent. So, if your bill is $55.00, 10 percent is $5.50. To figure out 15%, take half of $5.50 and add it to the $5.50. Thus, 15 percent would be $8.25. To calculate 20 percent, shift the decimal point on your bill amount to the left. Round up. For example, $35.84 would become $3.58. Remember, that\u2019s 10 percent. Then, double the number to get 20 percent."

          "description":"There will be some circumstances where the tip will already be factored into your bill. In those cases, you don\u2019t need to tip again. Typically, the gratuity will be 15 or 18 percent when it\u2019s automatically included. Some restaurants have a rule that the tip is automatically included when large groups dine. It will usually say \u201cgratuity included\u201d on your bill or the menu in those cases. This is done because if even one or two people in the group were to skimp on the tip, the server would be unlikely to make the basic amount. Large groups are very time consuming for a server and more work. You should ask in advance or check the menu or restaurant website to see if the gratuity is included."

For example, if you received the benefit of a wine steward, it\u2019s customary to also tip 15 percent the cost of the bottle of wine. You can tip the coatroom attendant about $1 per coat or $2 for the parking valet or garage attendant, if you\u2019ve left your car with them while dining. You can leave a smaller tip to your restaurant server if the food is served buffet style or the server brings you drinks only, but you should still tip between 10 and 15 percent. Some restaurants have washroom attendants; tip them 50 cents to $1. You might want to tip the headwaiter or captain separately also.

Most smart phones also come with a calculator, which will allow you to calculate the tip yourself, depending on the amount you decide to leave. Various websites will calculate the tip for you. All you have to do is plug in the amount of your bill, and the percentage amount of the tip you want to leave. In some states, the sales tax is about 5 percent. If that\u2019s the case, you could multiply the sales tax listed on your bill by three in order to get 15 percent. If you used any coupons or discounts, calculate the tip based on how much you would've paid without it. Otherwise, you're punishing the waiter for the restaurant management's efforts to bring you in the door."

It\u2019s not uncommon for servers to make just over $2 an hour before they receive tips. They often make well under minimum wage. Although American states have different minimum wages, the federal minimum wage for tipped restaurant workers is just $2.13. Some servers also are required to share or pool their tips at the end of the night or to contribute for tips to bartenders, lowering their overall haul.

Try communicating with the server first, though, about what\u2019s making you unhappy to give the server a chance to fix it. A tip to a server is meant to acknowledge good service. If your server ignored you, had a bad attitude, or served your food late, it\u2019s OK to not leave a full tip. Assess how the food matched your order, whether the food was hot and fresh, how attentive the server was, how quickly your empty dishes were removed, and whether the server was courteous. You might want to explain the lack of a tip, in nice and constructive terms, on the bill when you pay the check, though. Some believe you should still give at least 10 percent even if you\u2019ve received poor service. Take care to determine whether the poor service was really the server\u2019s fault. For example, perhaps the kitchen didn\u2019t get the food to the server on time or management understaffed the restaurant."

Better yet, call over the manager and tell the manager about the good job the server did. Always treat your server to a smile and be kind and polite.
