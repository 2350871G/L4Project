For the hot water, simply turn your tap on as hot as it will go and add it to the noodles. If you soak the noodles in boiling water, they'll take less time to soften. Usually, 3 minutes is all you need. If you're not using rice noodles, you may need to actually cook them before frying them. Check the package for instructions on how to prepare them."

Place the noodles in a bowl and add a few drops of oil to keep them from sticking together before tossing them gently. You can use vegetable oil, canola oil, or peanut oil to keep the noodles from sticking together. If you're worried about the noodles sticking together even with the oil, you can spread them out on a large baking sheet or tray so they aren't tangled together."
