Carefully check any areas of your body that are warm or have a skin fold, as this is where ticks are most commonly found. In particular, check in and around your hair, around your ears, inside your tummy button, around your waist, between your legs, the back of your knees, and under your arms.

If you are checking a child for ticks, make sure to check both sides of their body thoroughly. If you don't have a full-length mirror, use a hand-held mirror to check the back of your body instead."
