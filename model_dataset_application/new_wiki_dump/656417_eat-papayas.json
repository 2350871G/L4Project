  "text":" Choosing a Papaya Pick local fruit. As with all fruit, papaya is the best when locally grown and picked. If it is available in your area, pick or purchase it for the best taste. If not, try to choose fruit imported from areas closest to your location to insure freshness and flavor. Try kapaho papaya. This papaya is grown in Hawaii and Costa Rica, and is known for a small to medium sized fruit with sweet, yellow flesh. Try a Mexican papaya. Mexican papayas are much larger than kapaho papayas, and have orange or red flesh on the inside. They are known for the tendency of having a bland or bitter flavor. Eating a Papaya Raw Refrigerate the papaya. Although papayas can be eaten at room temperature, the flavor is best when served cold. Place a whole or halved papaya into the fridge to prepare it. Slice the fruit in half. Papayas are very soft and can be cut with a spoon, but for a smooth edge use a paring knife. Scoop out and discard the black seeds at the center with a spoon. Rinse the inside. Run the centers under cold water to clear out any of the seeds or pulp that may make a mess when eaten. Place on a plate when finished. Quarter a lemon or lime. The acid in these citruses help to enhance the natural flavor of the papaya. Squeeze the juice over the fruit for the best taste. Scoop out the flesh with a spoon.
