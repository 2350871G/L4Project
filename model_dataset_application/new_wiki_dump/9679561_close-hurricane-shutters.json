  "text":" Accordion Shutters Unlock the shutters. The first thing you need to do is make sure the shutters are unlocked. There should be a lock with a keyhole on one side of the window frame. Put the key into the keyhole and turn it to unlock the shutters. Disengage the locking rods. If your shutters have locking rods, you\u2019ll need to disengage them. There is likely one on the bottom on either side of the window. Turn each handle to unlock the rods. The top rods will raise up and the lower rods will slide down. The locking rods hold the shutters out of the way when they\u2019re not in use. Pull the shutters to the center of the window. Grasp the edge of the shutter on one side and pull it toward the center of the window frame. Repeat on the other side. The shutters should meet in the middle. Fit the grooves together. Fit the outside blade on one shutter into the inside groove in the other. The inside blade on the other shutter should also fit into the outside groove of the first shutter. Lock the shutters. Simply push on the lock to snap it closed. Engage the locking rods. Pull the locking rods on the bottom of the shutters upwards. Lower the locking rods on the top of the shutters. The locking rods keep the shutters from rattling in strong winds. Rolling Shutters Fit the provided tool over the lowering mechanism. Roll-down shutters come with a tool to lower them. The tool is a long, metal bar with a crank on one end. The other end fits over the lowering mechanism, which is located in the top corner of shutter housing. Turn the crank to the left to lower the shutters. Once the tool is in place, spin the crank to the left. Continue spinning until the shutters have lowered completely over the window. Remove the tool and store it for future use. When the shutters are in place, you can remove the tool from the lowering mechanism. Be sure to store it somewhere handy so you can use it to raise the shutters after the storm has passed. Colonial Shutters Remove the pins securing the shutters to the siding. To keep your shutters from banging against your home, they are likely secured to the siding with the help of a pin. Remove each pin connecting the shutters to the siding. Swing the shutters in toward the center of the window. Grasp the edge of one shutter and swing it inward 180 degrees. Repeat with the other shutter so the windows are covered and the shutters meet in the center. Put the storm bar in place across both shutters. There are brackets on the outside of the shutters that hold the storm bar in place. Fit the storm bar into these brackets. Secure the storm bar with screws and wingnuts. Insert a screw into each hole in the bracket. Then, screw a wingnut onto each screw to keep them in place. You should be able to do this by hand, and won\u2019t need any tools. You will likely need 4 screws and 4 wingnuts: 1 on each side and 2 in the middle of the shutters. Maintaining Hurricane Shutters Inspect your shutters once a year before hurricane season.
