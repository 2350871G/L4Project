  "text":" Gathering the Materials Look for leaves that are still fresh. If collecting autumn or fallen leaves, stay away from those that are crumbly and papery, as these will break apart extremely easy and be destroyed by the heat.

Preserving the Leaves Place the leaves in between two sheets of wax paper, with the waxed side facing inside.
