Once you reach 20, a cutscene will be triggered, and you\u2019ll be prompted to head to Crescent Hill. If you glance at the lower right side of your screen, you\u2019ll see that a Quest has been added to the list. If you left-click the option to head over to Barthold, you will find yourself automatically being taken to Crescent Hill, specifically to the Dimensional Mage Barthold. After speaking to him, you can now choose to accept the quest or not. Do note that the Dimensional Key he gives you after accepting only lasts for 24 hours. If it expires, go to your Journal, click the Quest\u2019s entry and click on the \u201cAbandon\u201d button. This will let you talk to Barthold again and receive the Key again. Recruit a party. While this dungeon can be accessed by anyone by themselves, to truly take advantage of it, you need two others who have accepted this quest. To the left of your World Map is an icon that looks like a person holding a wooden sign. If you click on that, you\u2019ll see the Party Menu open. You can click the option on the upper left to only let you see what parties are recruiting for a level-appropriate dungeon. On the left, you can see what dungeons you can start raiding\u2014in this case, \u201cDimensional Hall (20+).\u201d Click on that, and on the right side, you\u2019ll see what parties are recruiting for that dungeon. You can then click on a promising name on the list, then click the \u201cJoin\u201d button under it. When you click on the party you wish to join, you can also view which members are already in it on the upper right part of the menu. If you\u2019ve made friends beforehand, pop open your Social Menu, which can be opened by clicking on the icon that looks like two people being buddies. Scroll down to whoever is online and the appropriate level, right-click their name, then click \u201cInvite to Party.\u201d\nIt\u2019s highly recommended you take a Bard with you or have a member with Merrilee as their Eidolon, since this dungeon is normally your first taste in beating bosses by waves. Your invitation is automatically rejected if they\u2019re fighting a monster or already part of a party. You can invite your friend to your party even if they\u2019re on a different channel, but you need to be on the same channel if you want to beat dungeons together. Travel to the Dimensional Hall. Now that you have two other people along for the ride, it\u2019s time to head on over to the Dimensional Hall. Use the portal right behind Barthold. Click the portal and click the option \u201cDimensional Hall (20+).\u201d Unlock the Dimensional Shackles. Now pick one of the three large floating crystals, and click on it. All three party members need to pick different ones. Choose to unlock the Shackles when given the option. Brace yourself for a fight. You\u2019ll suddenly have to fight off some monsters and a couple mid-bosses before the actual boss comes around. Coordinate with your members and don\u2019t die! Repeat the dungeon four more times. While you\u2019ll get an achievement from beating this, plus the usual quest prizes, you\u2019ll need to do this four more times before you get the title \u201cBanisher,\u201d which adds 3 points to SPD when equipped. You can just ask Barthold for the quest after finishing it, but since it\u2019s a daily quest, you might need a few days to completely finish it, since you need the key to unlock it. Becoming the Crescent Conqueror Know your quarry. The \u201cCrescent Conqueror\u201d title is given to you when you manage to defeat and capture all the four mid-boss monsters wandering in the area. Those monsters are distinguishable by the silver crowns hovering above their names and by the dragon head icon roaming around in the map. The four, from weakest to strongest, are <Alluring Fragrance> Bayin, <The Glutton> Doniland, <Deadly Poison> Senka, and <Troll Berserker> Varis. Seek them out. Of course, you can\u2019t kill them if you can\u2019t find them. Bayin is the easiest to find, since he hangs out right at the western edge of town and is basically an overgrown Lunar Flower Dryad. Next is Doniland, who is a rather overgrown Flower Trap and lurks at the south, in the Flower Field. Senka, a huge beetle, is at the northern part of Clark\u2019s Farm. And finally, Varis lumbers about, looking very much like an extra-large golem, in the northern corner of the Alabastren Temple Ruins. They respawn at random times, but are found in the mentioned areas. Defeat the monsters. Now it\u2019s time to fight them! The weakest, Bayin, is at level 21, while the strongest, Varis, is at level 29. There aren\u2019t actually a lot of requirements to defeat them, just decent equipment, good timing, and maybe a few potions. But after the battle, you need to have at least one slot free in your inventory. This is because the four monsters are immediately \u201csealed\u201d in a crate or urn that you need to take back to the village. When you click on the urn or crate that appears when the monsters are defeated, it immediately becomes a cart that follows you around. Note that you can only carry one crate or urn with you at a time, so you can \u2018t go fight all of the monsters at once. The crates or urns also have a time limit. It only lasts for 20 minutes in your inventory before it disappears. It also disappears if you log off or switch characters or server channels. Report to Albert. Once you\u2019re dragging the cart, head on over to the Village Guard Albert. He\u2019s found at the southern exit of town, by the stairs near the Banker and past the Chefs. He\u2019ll gratefully take your spoils and reward you with a chest of loot for your troubles. Once you hand the last of the mid-bosses to him, you\u2019ll get your fancy new title, which grants you an additional 8 DMG when you equip it. Completing the Sonjuno\u2019s Demise Quest Find the Alabastren Temple. If you\u2019ve managed to reach the end of the Crescent Hill questline, you\u2019ll be prompted to head over to the Temple. If not, you can still tackle the area once you\u2019re around level 28 or so. It\u2019s found at the far northeast of the map, and the entrance is at the furthest eastern section. If you\u2019re completing the Main Quest prompt, simply use the automatic function of your Quest Log to take you there instantly. You can also use the Warp Portal southeast of town. It\u2019s the pagoda with the floating blue jewel. Click on the jewel and choose the Instance tab, which shows you the dungeons available at your current level, then pick Alabastren Temple. Complete the dungeon. You\u2019ll be able to get Silver, Armor, and Weapon chests and Refining materials from beating the monsters, as well as some special equipment from the three bosses inside. You\u2019ll need to be ready for the fights, though, so buy the best stuff you can afford and train up Eidolons you want to use! You can also tackle this as a party of up to 5 members. Go solo ten times. You can enter the dungeon by yourself around four times a day. Leaving the dungeon counts as you entering, but not beating the dungeon. You get a title if you beat it three times, then another at five times, then the last Solo title at ten times. The first title is \u201cLife After Death,\u201d which adds 6 points to your HP. The second title is \u201cBig Comeback,\u201d which boosts your DMG by 7 points. The last Solo title in this dungeon is \u201cWalking Dead,\u201d which grants you a nice bonus of 12 HP and 3 SPD. Beat it as a party ten times. The dungeon in general is a bit harder to compensate for the extra party members. If you can get your party to stick with you enough times, or attempt it enough times with decent members, you\u2019ll get a title when you beat it three, five, and ten times. When you finish the Crescent Hill questline, this unlocks a Daily Party Quest prompt from Halton, though you can only reap the Daily Quest reward (if you\u2019ve already progressed to the end of the Crescent Hill questline) once a day. You can also enter this about three times a day as well. The first of the Party titles is \u201cBarely Alive,\u201d which adds 12 HP when equipped. The second you can get is \u201cDemolition Party,\u201d which has nice bonus 12 points to DMG and 3 points to SPD when equipped. The last of the titles from beating it in Party mode is \u201cUndead,\u201d granting you an additional 1 SPD and 14 HP when equipped.",
