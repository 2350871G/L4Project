Shake thoroughly, until the egg white has broken up into froth; the cocktail will be very unpleasant if it still contains globs of egg white. When properly shaken, the egg white will make the cocktail much smoother on the mouth, and soften the lemon flavor a little. Shaking the ingredients together without the ice first may help emulsify the egg white, distributing it evenly throughout the drink. You can skip this step and just shake everything once, but shake extra vigorously to make up for it. There is a tiny risk of salmonella infection from raw egg white. If you are concerned about this, or if you are serving the drink to an elderly or immune-compromised person, use \"pasteurized shell\" eggs."
