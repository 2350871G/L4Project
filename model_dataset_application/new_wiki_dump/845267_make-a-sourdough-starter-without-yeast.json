For all container types, you can soak in a solution of 1 tablespoon of bleach and 1 gallon (3.8 litres) of water for 30 minutes. Be sure to soak the lid as well, and rinse the containers to remove all of the bleach."

The water should be around 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Either measure the temperature with a  thermometer or check it on your wrist. It should be bath-water warm, but not uncomfortably so."
