If the invitation doesn\u2019t specify, call the host and ask. Smart casual is a dress code which is somewhat informal but in which you are still expected to be well-dressed. This can mean anything from a dressy pair of pants and a nice shirt to a dress and heels. Feel free to express your style!"

          "description":"Tea parties are a fun time to dress up, so embrace the chance to wear your Sunday best. Patterns, especially florals, are popular, but stay away from all-black looks. Tea-length dresses typically fall midway between the knee and the ankle, but just above or below the knee is also an acceptable look. Avoid very short dresses, as a tea party is not the most appropriate occasion for a miniskirt. A sun dress featuring a pastel floral pattern is a perfect look for a spring tea party."

          "description":"A well-tailored suit looks great on either a man or a woman, and a tea party is a great occasion to wear one without looking overdressed. Try pairing a masculine suit with a brightly-colored Oxford shirt or a tie in a cheerful color. Accent a feminine suit with a pretty blouse."

        {
          "headline":"Choose nice trousers for casual elegance.",
          "description":"Trousers paired with dress shoes and a nice top are a timeless look that is appropriate for any tea party. For more formal occasions, choose trousers made from a luxe material like fine wool or chiffon. Trousers are very versatile and can be worn with an Oxford shirt, a flowy blouse, a sweater set, or a structured top."

          "headline":"Pair a skirt with a sweater set for a sweet, classic look.",
          "description":"A skirt and sweater set is an outfit that's appropriate for all ages. Pick a skirt that falls at or just below the knee. Dress up your look even more by pinning a sparkly brooch to your sweater. Channel Jackie O by wearing a full skirt with a nipped-in waist, a luxe sweater set, oversized sunglasses and buckle flats. Add on a pillbox hat to really complete the look. Get a more modern look by pairing a slim-fitting skirt with a cropped sweater and your favorite heels. A floppy hat with a dramatic bow is a fitting compliment to this outfit."

          "headline":"Add a blazer or shawl if the weather is cool.",
          "description":"If you\u2019re concerned about the weather, adding a blazer or a shawl can help you to stay warm. A fitted blazer can dress up a pair of trousers or can add a cool touch to a dress, while a shawl is an elegant addition to any outfit. Wrap an ultra-soft knit shawl around your shoulders to add a feminine touch to a wool dress during cool weather. Wear a blazer with a pair of ankle-length trousers and short boots for a cool masculine style. If the tea party is more casual, you can push up the sleeves of the blazer."

Hats can range from elaborate wide-brimmed sun hats to simple cloches, or you can even opt to wear a pretty fascinator or hair flower. Coordinate your hat with your outfit. A fedora looks sharp with a masculine suit, for instance, while a fascinator may be the perfect topper for a sleek sheath dress."

Gloves can be short or long, depending on how dressy you want them to be. Longer gloves are considered more formal. It\u2019s customary to leave your hat on during tea, but you should remove your gloves before service begins."

If you like, you can choose one statement piece, like a cocktail ring or a sparkly brooch, but keep the rest of your jewelry simple. Dress up a neutral shift dress with a long strand of pearls or a statement necklace and a simple pair of stud earrings."

Open-toed shoes are acceptable during spring and summer, and closed-toe dress shoes are appropriate for any time of year. Don\u2019t wear casual shoes like tennis shoes or flip flops. A floral sun dress would pair well with a sun hat and wedges. Show your personality in a masculine suit by choosing your favorite dress shoe, like wingtip brogues or leather loafers."

          "description":"You can create a refined hairstyle whether you have short or long hair. Try to coordinate your hairstyle with your outfit to suit the special occasion. If you're wearing a hat, make sure to take that into account when you're planning your hairstyle. If you have medium-length to long hair and you're wearing a chic pantsuit, twist your hair into a chignon or a French twist. Top this with a smart pillbox hat. A pretty sundress is the perfect outfit for wearing your hair in loose waves. Either a wide-brimmed hat or a fascinator will look nice with this hair style. If you have short hair and you're wearing a suit, gel your hair into a pompadour or wear it parted on the side or slicked straight back."

Short hair can be combed back or to the side and held in place with pomade or gel, and long hair can be styled into ringlets, braids, or an up-do. A fishtail crown braid is an elegant style for long hair that is perfect for a princess tea party. Use hair gel to create a side part, pompadour, or a slicked-back look on short hair. To get ringlets without heat styling, add a little curling gel to your child's damp hair. Twist sections of the hair away from your child's face and use bobby pins to pin the coil close to the scalp. Allow the curls to set for at least an hour before unwinding the twists. Add a little more gel to the ends to help the curls hold."
