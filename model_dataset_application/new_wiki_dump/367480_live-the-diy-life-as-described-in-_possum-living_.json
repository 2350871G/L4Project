Or you could even live in a wall tent, tepee, yurt, or plywood (or even cardboard, painted to weatherproof) shack. You may be able to sell your expensive vehicle and other non-necessary items to pay for this. Or, buy on a land contract and pay it off as soon as possible."

Put together a battery bank and either use DC lights and appliances (preferably scrounged), or buy or barter for an inverter. If you are into electronics, you could even build your own inverter; they are simple. Build a wind generator, scrounge some used PV (solar) panels, and/or build, buy or barter for a gas or diesel generator."

A pickup truck is best for this lifestyle, better is a diesel pickup so you can make your own fuel for (biodiesel or WVO), and best yet is an old non-running mini-truck (Isuzus are cheap, and tough) into which you can swap an old Mercedes, VW or other small diesel engine. Advantages? 35-40 mpg on home-made, cheap fuel; and the ability to haul home scrounged goods. You may be able to put together such a vehicle for a few hundred bucks."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Buy tools.",
      "description":"Carry a multi-tool, a knife and other useful items on your person, in belt pouches, fanny pack, backpack or whatever; and carry a toolbox of more serious tools in your truck. Have more tools yet at home, including a welder and air compressor. Better yet, especially if your generator isn't big enough to power these items, convert a heavy-duty alternator to double as a welder, and mount it in your truck. Also find an older piston-type automotive air conditioning compressor, convert to an air compressor, and mount that in your truck, too. These tools are for fixing your stuff that breaks, fixing other folks' stuff for pay, barter or just to help out, and disassembling cast-off stuff you find on trash day, either to pick off the good parts on the spot, or break it down to a more manageable size."

      "headline":"Raise as much of your own food as possible.",
      "description":"Have a garden and orchard on your small tract of land, and don't forget chickens and perhaps even pigs, which can be fed for free. You can also raise fish and crayfish in a plastic wading pool or similar."
