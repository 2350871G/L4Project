Lemon myrtle grows better in neutral soil than it does in acidic soil, and alkaline soil can cause the leave to turn yellow. Warmer colors typically mean an acidic reading. If your soil is too acidic, you can raise the pH by adding a base like limestone or wood ash to the area where you want to plant your tree. Cooler colors usually mean the soil is alkaline. If your soil is too alkaline, you may be able to lower the pH by adding sulfur or aluminum sulfate to your soil. Both are available at home and garden stores."
