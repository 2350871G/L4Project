  "text":" Preparing Design your space. Use graph paper to draw out the room dimensions. Figure out the placement of tables (round or rectangular) for food, DJ and/or games.

Walls and other areas should be decorated with remaining materials not used in making the arch or the tents. Lastly, decorate the tables. Magic Carpet Ceiling Place two strings width-wise across the room, spaced about 10 feet apart if possible. For more permanent installations, use a pulley system and cleats on the wall so the line can be lowered. Cut sections of gossamer off a roll to identical lengths so about 2 feet hangs off either side of the line and the rest drapes from one line to another. Purchased in various colors from party supply store in 25 foot rolls. Lower sting and find the center. Start with the center colors and staple the gossamer around the cord. Space next roll approximately 6-8\" from the first (~2 fist lengths). The pattern of colors can resemble a magic carpet. Use 3 purple strips in the center, surrounded by 1 turquoise strip on either side, then 1 red strip on either side and 1 black strip on both ends. Once everything is secured, raise into place.  Cave of Wonders Entryway Decorate an inexpensive lighted arch with colored gossamer. Weave colored gossamer through the horizontal members. Place the arch about 2 feet inside the entry doorway. Lay 2 strips of black gossamer (19\" wide) side by side and attach together with tape or staples. Lay another 2 strips on the ground and attach together. Place the created strips on top of each other. Attach the long end of the black gossamer to the frame of the arch and attach the other side to the wall above the door. Curling ribbon can act as scaffolding or a support for the gossamer. Tye it to the arch and tape it to the wall above the door. Use staples and blue painter's tape where necessary. For stability, tie the arch to a folding chair and/or the door frame for stability. The purpose of the covered arch was to prevent the guests from being able to see the room decorations until they walk through the entry. EZ-up Tent Decorations Assemble EZ up tents inside the space. Criss-cross gossamer over the top of the tent so that it drapes down over the legs of the tent or just tie it to the framework and let it hang down the legs. Gather the gossamer around the leg so that it blouses or spreads out at the top and tie with ribbon or string (use curling ribbon) in the center.  Tie/staple colored streamers (paper or metallic) to the frame. Let them hang down along the back and/or sides. Put up cardboard cutouts of stars, moons and genie lamps decorated with glitter. Hang paper lamps with small battery powered lights from the center pole of front of the tent. Table Decoration Suggestions Cover tables with brightly colored tablecloths. Place scrunched up gossamer in the center of the table. Small cardboard boxes can be used as risers and covered with similar colored gossamer. Make inexpensive vases. You can use larger sized canning jars painted on the inside with white paint. The outside of the jars can be spray painted with gold metallic paint. Add flower arrangements with a mixture of lavender, ornamental grasses, and small palm leaves that were tied with curling ribbon. Place inexpensive candle holders on the tables with tea lights inside. Spray square candles with spray adhesive and rolled in glitter. Add colorful chocolate coins and Mardi Gras for color. ",
