The beach is obviously the center of interest but the white building in the upper left corner and the other building draws attention away from the beach. Crop this type of distraction by including just a portion of the white building. Notice the simplicity of professional photos and frames of scenes in well made movies, and imitate this simplicity in your photos. Learn from the graphic design of products like beer ads. When composing your photo, think how a professional photographer would take the picture, and take your photo like a professional photographer. Move a bit, move a lot and use the different setting in your camera to arrange the elements in your photo."
