          "description":"If you're doing homemade, combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast, and salt into a mixer bowl and combine the ingredients. As the mixer is running, add water and 2 tablespoons of oil and beat until the dough forms a ball. If the dough is sticky, add more bread flour. If the dough is too dry, add small amounts additional water to moisten. Scrape the dough together onto a lightly floured surface and begin to knead into a smooth ball for 10 minutes. Continue adding flour when the ball becomes too sticky\nA good way to test if the dough has been kneaded enough is to raise the ball of dough a foot above the surface and drop it, if the ball stays in tact then you are good to go, if not then keep kneading. Glaze a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons of olive oil, then add the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm area for about an hour to allow it to double in size. Take the dough, and once again place it on a lightly floured surface and divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Cover each piece with plastic wrap and allow it to sit for 10 minutes."

Take the dough, and once again place it on a lightly floured surface and divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Cover each piece with plastic wrap and allow it to sit for 10 minutes. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.  Divide the dough into 8, 1/2 cup portions. Two pieces of dough will be used for each jar. Once the dough is prepared, add \u00bd cup dough to the bottom of the mason jars. This dough will end up being the bottom piece of bread in our pizza. Place the mason jars in a deep dish filled with water, to prevent the glass from breaking in the oven due to sudden changes in surrounding temperature The water will facilitate heating the dough without the expense of breaking the jar in the oven. The water should reach at least halfway up the sides of the jars. Before adding any more ingredients or layers, bake the dough as is for 15-20 minutes or until brown and crisp.  Add the other layers including the tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and toppings if you chose any. The order of the layers will not affect the taste of the dish so layer as you please! To complete your pizza, add another \u00bd cup layer of dough on top of the other layers and toppings.  Place the jars in the deep dish with water to bake once more. Allow for the dough to bake for 15-20 minutes or until crisp and brown. Carefully remove the dish and jars from the oven.  Remove the jars from the dish.

Heat mixture until it boils. Immediately reduce heat to low and let simmer for 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lower the oven rack toward the bottom to allow space for baking dish and jars. Fill the deep baking dish halfway with water. The water will rise when the jars are placed inside. The water helps distribute heat in the jar so it does not break. Add a layer of dough to the mason jars. Divide the dough evenly into 4 ounce servings. For store-bought, pre-rolled, dough you can cut out circular portions about the size of the diameter of the jar. Place the jars in the deep baking dish. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Cooking times may vary. Look for your dough to be golden brown in color. Remove baking dish from oven.
