          "description":"Personal chefs provide a range of services. Some offer assistance with dinner parties (or other single-meal events like date night) by planning a menu, shopping, prepping the ingredients, cooking, and cleaning up. Others offer their services more regularly through weekly meal prep\u2014cooking a variety of dishes for you to reheat and serve throughout the week."

Accommodating conditions like diabetes or gluten allergies can be easier with the guidance of a professional. Or, you may simply be interested in eating healthier and incorporating more organic ingredients. Keep in mind that more restrictive dietary requests, such as organic only or gluten-free, will likely increase the cost."

          "headline":"Ask yourself if certification or professional affiliation is important to you.",
          "description":"A certified or professionally affiliated chef has met certain standards and undergone training in safe food handling and preparation. They likely value continuing education and perpetually progressing in their craft. Through their professional association, they also have access to the latest industry trends and research. These are typically national or international organizations. Some well-known examples include the International Association of Professional Organizations, the American Personal and Private Chef Association, and the United States Personal Chef Association. Not all personal chefs belong to a professional chef organization, however, and that doesn't mean they\u2019re not reputable cooks. A chef with culinary training or work experience in a restaurant is likely reputable, even if they haven't joined a professional organization. Hiring based on professional affiliation simply assures that all candidates have been fully vetted by industry professionals. Certified or affiliated chefs are generally more expensive."

          "headline":"Come up with a budget so you know what chefs you can afford.",
          "description":"Hiring a personal chef can be much more affordable than you might expect. Half a day\u2019s cooking (approximately two meals for the week) costs upwards of $250. Prices vary significantly depending on your area and whether you\u2019ve got strict dietary restrictions, however. Decide how much you can budget for a personal chef, and use that number to guide your search. In the U.S., for instance, the median price of a personal chef cooking five meals for a family of four is roughly $200-$300 per week (not including groceries). Compared to North America, personal chef services are about 15% more expensive on average in Asia and South America. To save money, consider hiring a talented amateur cook\u2014they tend to be far cheaper than a professional personal chef. Think of friends, family members, or acquaintances who are excellent cooks and consider asking them if they would be willing to regularly prepare meals for you or your family for a fee. The best way to find amateur cooks is typically through personal networks like friends or neighbors. Splitting the service with another family or a friend can also make a personal chef more affordable."
