          "description":"As a living organism, algae draws nutrients from the water in order to live. Add some more appealing plants, such as lily pads, cattails, or watercress, to your pond that will suck up all of those nutrients and stop algae from being able to grow. This can help keep your water clear and make your pond look more interesting. Your local nursery or garden store should have a wide selection of plants perfect for your pond. Ask if you\u2019re unsure about the best types of plant to use. For best results, cover around 60% of the surface of your pond with plants."

          "description":"If you have fish in your pond, you should only feed them the amount of food that they can consume in around 5 minutes. If you feed them more than this, the excess food will drift to the bottom and rot, which can be a catalyst for algae growth. If you\u2019re unsure about how much to feed your fish, check the instructions on your fish food for a rough guide. You should be feeding your fish once a day with a small sprinkling of food. Watch your fish for 5 minutes after you feed them to see how much food is left over and adjust accordingly."

          "description":"The easiest way to clean algae from the top of a pond is simply lifting it up and off. Use a skimmer or algae net to skim the surface of your pond, pulling the algae free and removing it from the pond. This may take a while, but will give you immediate results when it\u2019s done. Although this is a very quick solution, it\u2019s not one that will work long-term. Removing the algae won\u2019t stop it from growing back."

          "headline":"Add barley straw to the pond to slowly kill the algae.",
          "description":"As it rots, barley straw will slowly release small amounts of hydrogen peroxide that will kill any algae growing in your pond. Buy a small bale of barley straw and throw it into your pond when you first notice algae growing in your pond. Over the course of a few weeks, you should notice the algae in your pond disappearing. Use 8 ounces (0.23 kg) of barley straw for every 1,000 gallons (3,800 L) of water in your pond. Barley straw should be available from your local pet shop, as it is used for bedding for a lot of small animals. Otherwise, it may be available at a specialty pond store or online. The amount of hydrogen peroxide released by the rotting barley straw should be just enough to kill the algae, without killing any other plants in your pond."

Add a few tadpoles or some aquatic pond snails to your pond and keep an eye on them as they grow. They should begin eating the algae in your pond, as well as bringing a little more life to it. Tadpoles will also eat mosquito and other insect larvae that may settle on the top of your pond."

This will constantly aerate the water, keeping it moving to produce a healthier environment in the pond and prevent harmful algae. Fine bubble aerators should be available from a specialty pond store. If you don\u2019t have one nearby, there are plenty of online retailers that sell aerators."

Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to clean your filter at least once each month to prevent algae from forming. A pond filter isn\u2019t necessary, but can be useful in keeping the water in your pond clean. If you have a large mechanical filter, you should be able to clean it by attaching a backwash hose and backwashing the filter until the water runs clear. For smaller filters, remove the filter and clean it with non-chlorinated water to remove any obvious grime, gunk, or algae. Make sure you clean out your pond filter away from the pond. If you clean it too close the pond, everything you remove from the filter will end up back in your pond over time."

Install a pond filter that has an ultraviolet light sterilizer in your pond to break down and destroy algae as it grows. After 3 to 5 days, your water should be free of algae and clear. Filters with UV light sterilizers will be more expensive than other filters, but also a lot more effective. They should be available from a specialty pond store or online. This is a very effective way to kill algae in ponds, but may also harm beneficial bacteria and other positive organic material in your pond."

Purchase an algaecide or herbicide that contains copper and spray it over your pond to begin killing off the algae. You should see the algae begin to die off within 3 to 10 days from the first treatment. Algaecides and herbicides are made of chemicals that are designed to kill algae, so they will be more harmful than other natural methods used to remove algae. Use algaecides as a last resort. Always consult the instructions on your chosen algaecides or herbicides before using them in a pond with plants or living creatures. Make sure you check with local regulations before treating your water with an algaecide. You may need a permit for some chemicals in some locations. Always follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions when working with an algaecide. Using more than is required may damage your pond or harm any wildlife living in or around it."

Try building a pond near a tall wall, or use a shade mat or sail to stop algae from being able to grow.
