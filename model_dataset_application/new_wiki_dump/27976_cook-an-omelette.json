Next chop your filling into bite-sized pieces and shred some cheese. Some common omelette additions include onions, ham, bell peppers, green onions, spinach, sausage, olives, diced tomatoes, carrots and mushrooms. Use any or all of the ingredients, in  a combination of your choice. You can use cheddar cheese, swiss cheese, goat cheese, feta or any other type you like."
