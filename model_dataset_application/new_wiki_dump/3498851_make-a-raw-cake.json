          "description":"Oat groats are the most basic, unrefined form of oats. Often referred to as fresh-picked or fresh-harvested oats, oat groats are most commonly given to livestock as feed. Oats in this form digest very slowly and have a very low glycemic index value. Soak and dry the oat groats. Oat groats must be soaked overnight in order to be safely consumed by humans. Soaking the oat groats will begin the breakdown process of the gluten which makes oat groats easier to digest. Dry oat groats may cause indigestion or constipation. Note that the soaking and drying process will not affect the volume of the groats, but milling them will reduce the total volume by about half. If you have extra milled oat groats, you can save them in the freezer. Spread the soaked groats on a fine mesh surface such as a mill-grade sieve with a \u204410 inch (0.3 cm) gap between sieve wires and allow them to dry completely. The drying process can take up to six hours. Process the dried groats in a food processor until a fine powder is formed. This powder can be used as a thickening agent or a flour substitute in many recipes. Remember that it\u2019s important to let the groats dry thoroughly to prevent clumping when you mill them in a food processor."
