Then, carefully remove the cap and allow the remaining product to slide out. The amount of time it will take for the product to slide down towards the opening varies depending on the type of product. For example, liquid facewash or mouthwash will likely take much less time than a thick lotion or conditioner."

While there will likely still be some product residue left behind, these tiny spatulas fit through the opening of most travel bottles and will allow you to scrape much of the product from the sides and bottom. Beauty spatulas are widely available online and at many beauty supply stores."

Replace the cap and shake the bottle to swish the water around so that it combines with the remaining product and loosens it from the bottle walls. Remove the cap and pour out the remaining thinned, liquefied product. While liquefied lotion or makeup will likely be too messy to use, if your travel bottle contained shampoo, conditioner, or facewash, you can use the diluted last bit of product so that it\u2019s not wasted."

Replace the cap and shake the bottle to combine the water and vinegar, then let the solution sit for about 15 minutes. Dump the solution into the sink and rinse the bottle with water.

Leave the bottles to soak overnight, then rinse them with water to remove any residual dish soap. If there was any product residue left in the bottle, you\u2019ll likely see it floating on top of the water after soaking overnight. If you want to clean the bottle faster, try filling it with a squirt of dish soap and water. Replace the cap and shake the bottle vigorously. Then, pour out the dish soap solution, as well as any residual product, and rinse the bottle with water."

Then, pour out the alcohol along with any product residue and rinse it with water. Let the bottle air dry completely before refilling it with product. Air drying will allow the alcohol residue to continue to disinfect before dissipating as it dries."

          "description":"To sanitize your travel bottles, you can run them through the dishwasher after removing as much of the product as possible. Make sure that you check whether the material is dishwasher safe first, however, as the heat could damage or ruin some types of plastic and silicone. While some plastic and silicone travel bottles are dishwasher safe, others are not. Therefore, you can\u2019t necessarily determine whether you can run them through the dishwasher based on the material alone. To see whether your travel bottles are dishwasher safe, check the label on the bottles or packaging, or look on the brand\u2019s website. In most cases, dishwashers get hotter at the bottom. Therefore, you may want to put your travel bottles on the top rack to keep them away from the highest levels of heat."
