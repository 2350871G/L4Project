  "text":" Prepare the Batter Start by getting a large bowl.  Next, put the egg yolk into the bowl, scooping out any shell.  Whisk this for about a minute until the egg yolk is golden and reasonably runny.  Take one large tablespoon of flour and put it with the egg yolk.  Mix!  Gradually add more flour to the egg yolk.  If the mixture gets stiff, and milk or water (the healthier option).  Once you have a lovely reasonably runny batter, leave the bowl on the table, and grab a pan.  Cook the Crispy Pancakes Turn the stove on to the nine-o'clock angle.  Pour on a spot of the grape seed oil on the heated pan.  Rub this around the surface of the pan with a tissue, to create a shiny glaze.  Pour on about half of your batter onto the pan and circle the mixture around to form a perfect circle.  Leave the batter to cook for about two or three minutes before flipping over.  Once you have flipped the pancake over, leave on the pan for another minute or two, before slipping carefully onto a plate.  Grab a spread, or filling to put across one side of your pancake.
