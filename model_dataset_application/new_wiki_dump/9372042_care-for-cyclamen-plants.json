          "description":"Cyclamen bloom during the winter in their natural habitat. They prefer temperatures between about 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 F (4\u00b0-15.5\u00b0 degrees C). This is pretty chilly for indoors, but if you keep your house on the cooler side, your cyclamen will be happy. If the temperature gets above 65\u00b0 F (18\u00b0 C) during the day, or dips under 50\u00b0 F (10\u00b0 C) at night, cyclamen usually won\u2019t succeed. Although they like cool environments and good air circulation, keep cyclamen away from drafty areas."

          "description":"Cyclamen love sunlight, but direct sunlight is a bit much for them. They don\u2019t like that much heat in general, and hotter temperatures will often force the plants to go into dormancy. A sunny window is great for them, as long as the sunlight isn\u2019t direct and the temperature is cool. An east or north-facing window is a good option."

Always water cyclamen near their base, and never pour water over the crown of the plant. This can cause the corm (the bulbous part at the base of the stem) to rot. You can use tap water for this, as long as you've let the water come to room temperature first."

If the soil stays moist during dormancy, the tuber (or corm) will rot and the plant will die. Once the soil gets dry, you won\u2019t need to re-moisturize it all summer long. While the cyclamen is dormant, you can store it in its pot or dig up the corm and keep it in a box of dry peat moss."

Dig up the corm, replant it in the fall, and start watering it again when new growth appears. Your cyclamen will produce another season of blooms. Cyclamen can live for many years and even though they look dead when dormant, they will spring back once the temperatures cool down. The corm is the tiny bulb at the bottom of the stalk. The plant's roots grow out of this bulb. The corm sits at ground level and is mostly visible, and the roots grow into the underground. Store the corm somewhere dry, like a box of dry peat moss kept in a cool, low-humidity area of your home."

Don\u2019t plant them too early, since they may react badly to the late summer heat. They love light but not direct sunlight, so choose a shady area of your garden that gets partial sun. In their natural habitat, cyclamen bloom under large deciduous trees and along rocky, shaded ridges. If any area of your garden is similar to this, your cyclamen will love to be planted there.
