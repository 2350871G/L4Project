      "description":"You can really decorate however you and your daughter wishes. We transformed our living room into a wintry wonderland by hanging many paper snowflakes that we had made from the ceiling at different lengths (using clear string and tape). Also, we took some Christmas lights out and strung them around the border of the room. We also had the traditional party balloons and streamers."

All throughout dinner the adults pretended to be cooks from the castle of Arendelle serving the royal princesses. The girls really got into it and made up their own princess names and what kingdoms they had come from."

      "description":"For a game, we had the girls on the Elsa team separately hide somewhere upstairs. Then the girls on the Anna team had to go find one girl on the Elsa team and bring her back to the living room. Luckily we had an even number. Once they came back downstairs, they had to pick up a white balloon off the ground (snowball) and pop it between them. We put the balloons on the ground while the Anna's were still looking to avoid popping them early."
