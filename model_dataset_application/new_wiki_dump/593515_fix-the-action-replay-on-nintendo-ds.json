The connectors that link your Action Replay to your DS are on the bottom back of your Replay. They are shaped like a series of flat, metallic teeth, much like the teeth of a comb. You can also use electronics cleaner, which is available at most electronics stores or larger retailers that have technology departments, like Target or Walmart. Do not use too much of your cleaner. This can do damage to the internal parts of your Action Replay or your DS. Instead, dampen your cotton-ball or Q-tip with your cleaner, wipe the connectors, and then dry with a clean, soft cloth."
