          "description":"Oftentimes, if you\u2019re cooking your roast with other ingredients like sliced vegetables or mushrooms, a little salt and pepper is all you need to add for seasoning. Try sprinkling 1 tablespoon (17 grams) each of salt and pepper over the entire roast before cooking it. If you feel this isn\u2019t enough salt and pepper, it\u2019s perfectly fine to add a little more. However, you probably shouldn\u2019t add more than 3 tablespoons (51 grams) each of salt and pepper for less than 8 pounds (3.6 kg) of roast. If your roast is a little dry, rub some olive oil over the surface before adding your salt and pepper, so that the seasoning will stick to the surface."

          "headline":"Use any combination of garlic powder, basil, thyme, or rosemary.",
          "description":"These tried and true seasonings are often used in roast recipes, especially when the meat being cooked is beef. Most recipes call for you to combine equal parts of each seasoning into a mixture, then rub that mixture over the entire roast. However, feel free to experiment with different ratios to find the combination you like the most! For best results, try using about 1 tablespoon (17 grams) of each of these spices for every 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of meat you\u2019re roasting. Onion powder is also a reliable seasoning, although you may not want to use it if the recipe you\u2019re cooking already involves onions."

          "description":"These seasonings will give your roast a much stronger flavor and are particularly good with roast lamb. Use these seasonings separately or combine them, but don\u2019t use more than 3 teaspoons (17 grams) of the seasonings in total for an average roast, unless you want the flavor profile to be particularly strong. Cumin and mint are 2 other seasonings that will also give your roast a stronger flavor than more traditional additives."

You can use around 1 tablespoon (17 grams) of chili powder for around 2 pounds (0.91 kg), but you should probably only use about \u00bc teaspoon (1.5 grams) of cayenne pepper for the same amount of meat. As with other dry rubs, combine your seasonings into a mixture, then rub that mixture all over your roast before you go to cook it."
