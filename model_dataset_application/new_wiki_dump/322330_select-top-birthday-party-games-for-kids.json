      "description":"Get a large piece of Styrofoam board for every four guests. Paint each board a different color, solid red or blue, for example. Now, use a bread knife to cut the boards into strange shaped pieces. For 4-5 year olds, three pieces is enough. 6-8 year olds can handle four or five, and from there on up, six or seven pieces should work."

      "headline":"Play Captain's Coming.",
      "description":"Have a \"narrator.\" When s/he yells \"Fried shrimp!\" the kids lay on their backs if they can and wiggle their fingers. When the narrator says, \"Seasick!\" everyone grabs a partner. Their partner puts their hands out like the railing on the boat and the other person reaches their head over the \"railing\" and barfs. Be sure to remind them not to get too energetic. If someone does not have a partner they're out. When the narrator calls, \"Shore!\" the players run to their right. If someone runs left he/she's out. If the narrator calls \"Ship!\" the remaining players run to their left. If a child runs right he/she's out. When a narrator says, \"Captain's Coming!\" Have the children put the sides of their hands on their foreheads, and stay still. When an adult shouts anything else for example, \"Seasick!\" the kids stay still. If anyone moves before the adult says, \"Yaarg!\" they're out. The last 5 remaining players win."

Draw a number from a hat and then stop the music. Whoever is standing on that number when the music stops is the winner! I have played this game at many school carnivals where the prize is a cake.

Then use a large box as a base, and attach the poster board to one side of it. Before attaching the poster board, paint a design on it, make one or more hole. The kids will have lot of fun throwing those bean bags. If you want you can even give bean bags as party favors."

The two balls in the middle of the two sides. The defenders and goalies can kick to block a goal or use their racket/foam weapon. The only thing they can't do is use their hands or block goals with their bodies. If a defender uses their belly to block a ball it is a point for the other team. People cannot use their hands at all, and cannot score a goal with a kick. If someone scores a goal it counts as 1 point. The first side to win a certain amount of points wins- such as 10, 15, 20 etc."
