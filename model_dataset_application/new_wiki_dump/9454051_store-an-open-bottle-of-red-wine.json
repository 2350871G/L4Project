          "description":"When it comes to storing wine, heat and oxygen are your enemies. Sealing your bottle and placing it in the fridge as soon as you\u2019re done drinking is the simplest way to slow down the oxidation process that turns wine into vinegar. While it\u2019s common knowledge that red wine should be enjoyed at room temperature, red wine should still be refrigerated after it\u2019s been opened. A wine fridge is a great option, too. It'll keep your wine cool enough to slow oxidation, but not as cold as a standard refrigerator.

Samuel Bogue\t\t\tWine Director & Consultant\t\t\t\tCool air will keep your wine fresh longer. Sam Bogue, a sommelier, says: \"In a cooler environment, you're going to see less of a reaction between the chemicals in the wine and the oxygen in the air. If you keep the wine at a higher temperature, you're going to accelerate that aging process. To keep it as fresh as possible, keep the wine as cool as you can without freezing it.\""

          "description":"The exact storage time depends on the type of wine, but 3 to 5 days is a good general guideline. Even after 5 days, it\u2019s worth doing a taste test. While the flavor might be a bit off, many wines are drinkable for at least a week after being opened. Wines with higher tannin levels and acidity will keep longer. A full-bodied, tannic cabernet could last a week without major flavor changes, while a delicate pinot noir could last 1 to 2 days. Organic and older wines can spoil within a day."

          "description":"Most red wines are best enjoyed at temperatures just cooler than room temperature, or around 62 to 66 \u00b0F (17 to 19 \u00b0C). Rapid temperature changes negatively affect wine, so warm a refrigerated red slowly by submerging the bottom of the bottle in a bowl of lukewarm water. Make sure the water is lukewarm and not hot. Start raising its temperature about 30 minutes before serving it. When you serve it, pour smaller amounts so the wine will warm in the glass faster."

          "description":"Never keep a bottle of wine on its side after opening. Oxygen spoils wine, so you want to reduce the amount of wine that\u2019s exposed to air. Storing a bottle on its side creates a larger surface area, which exposes more wine to oxygen."

If you store wine in a container half the size of a standard 750 milliliters (25.4  fl oz) bottle, there will be less space for air, which means less oxidation."

Insert the stopper into the bottle, then attach the pump to the stopper to remove oxygen from the bottle. Some wine connoisseurs suggest that vacuum pumps negatively affect aroma and taste. While you might want to finish an aged, expensive wine instead of pumping and storing it, pumping an average bottle of wine probably won\u2019t hurt its flavor."

Store any carbonated wines in the fridge, and try to enjoy them within 1 to 3 days. Sparkling reds are best enjoyed chilled, so there\u2019s no need for a lukewarm bath.

It\u2019s expensive, so might not be worth the price unless you routinely taste high quality bottles of wine. A Coravin is ideal if you like to regularly taste good wines but don't want to have more than a sip or a glass. The bottle is good as new after the Coravin reseals it, so your expensive aged wine, which spoils quickly, won't go to waste."

If a red has only started to lose its vibrant color and doesn\u2019t smell moldy or rancid, give it a taste test. If it\u2019s just slightly off, find another use for it. You could use it to deglaze a pan of sauteed onions or garlic for a sauce, use it in a stew, or add it to a meat marinade. For best results, your recipe should have lots of flavor. The wine will add an extra note, but the stronger flavors will tone down any sourness.
