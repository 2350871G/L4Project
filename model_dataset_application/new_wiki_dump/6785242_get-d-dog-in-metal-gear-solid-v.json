Ocelot will ask you to get back to Mother Base to check on D-Dog\u2019s growth twice. The first time is usually after you complete Episode 5 and some side ops. The second time you get called back will be sometime before Episode 7 or 8, and you should now have D-Dog available as your buddy."

Doing so will also unlock development for equipment that will allow D-Dog to kill, stun, and even use the Fulton Recovery System on enemies and vehicles."
