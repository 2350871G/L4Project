Think of how you would clean out hair from a hairbrush, and do the same for the lint, hair, and other things that are caught in the Velcro. Velcro tabs consist of two parts called a hook and loop fastener system. The rougher side is called the hook, and the softer side is called the loop. The hook is generally the part that collects the debris because this is the part of the Velcro that grabs and sticks. It is possible that over time your Velcro will stop being sticky because the hooks get damaged. In this case, cleaning will only do so much and you may have to replace the Velcro if you cannot restore its grabbing power."

Brush the Velcro in 1 direction parallel to the rows of hooks to get out any remaining pieces of lint and other matter. A stiff-bristled toothbrush works best, or you can use another kind of stiff brush like a dish brush or a pet brush. Be careful not to scrub too hard or you might damage the hooks on the Velcro. This is why it\u2019s important to work parallel to the hooks so that they keep their form as you brush out debris."
