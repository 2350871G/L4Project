With this approach, you can gain a certain understanding of their respective abilities, finding something that suits your gaming style, rather than bouncing around from class to class. The available classes are:\nLight Assault\nHeavy Assault\nCombat Medic\nInfiltrator\nEngineer\nMAX"

      "description":"How you play will depend a great deal on your environment:\nWhen in the open, play using RPGs, tanks , aircraft and sniper rifles (long range weapons ). In close quarters, light assaults can be used to flank enemies. Heavy assaults with their over-shields activated are guaranteed to win most one-on-one battles. You can use engineers to place turrets at key locations, like a door, to get a huge number of kills (provided someone watches your back)."
