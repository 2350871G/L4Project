Make sure the yeast is completely dissolved. If you are using instant yeast, you can skip this step and add the instant yeast later."

          "headline":"Mix the yeast with the milk, butter, eggs, sugar, salt, and flour in a large bowl.",
          "description":"The butter should be softened to room temperature to make this easiest. Pour in the remaining milk, the softened butter, the eggs, the sugar, and salt, as well as the yeast mixture that you created. Then, pour in 1.5 cups of flour and mix everything together thoroughly. If you are choosing to add lemon zest, ground mace, or nutmeg, add that now as well. If you are using instant yeast, you will add that now. After everything is blended, slowly add the remaining flour. You may use exactly four cups, or you may use a little bit more or less. Just make sure that the dough isn\u2019t too sticky or too dry."

          "headline":"Place the dough in an oiled bowl and let rise.",

Place the large ball of dough into the bowl, and roll it in place so that it\u2019s coated with the oil. Then, it\u2019s time to let the dough rise. Cover your bowl, either with a kitchen towel or with cling wrap. Let it rise in your kitchen (or any warm place) for about two to three hours. You can also let it rise overnight in your refrigerator, if that is easier."

        {
          "headline":"Knead dough and allow to rise again.",
          "description":"After the dough has almost doubled in volume, you want to push it down into the bowl and gently knead again. Then put the cover back on, set it aside once again, and let it double in size over about an hour and fifteen minutes. When the time has passed and the dough has risen again, knead it, split it into two halves, and let it rise a final time for about ten minutes. Finally, your dough is ready. Making kolache dough takes patience, but it\u2019s key that it has time to rise fully and bulk up. This creates the chewy, dense dough that kolaches are known for."

Press the cookie cutter or the rim of the glass firmly into the dough, and then peel up the dough around the circle. Roll your excess dough into a ball, and then use your rolling pin to flatten it out onto the floured surface again. Cut out the rounds, and then roll the excess dough up again.

Making kolache dough takes patience, but it\u2019s key that it has time to rise fully and bulk up. This creates the chewy, dense dough that kolaches are known for. Forming the Kolaches Roll out your dough on a floured surface. Once again, sprinkle some flour on a flat surface to prevent your dough from sticking to it. Using a rolling pin, flatten out your dough so that it is about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) thick. Cut your dough into rounds. Each round should be about 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) across.

Make sure that you don\u2019t make the indentations too large \u2013 each round should still have about a 0.5 inch (1.27 cm) rim around the perimeter. Preparing the Toppings Make a cherry topping for your kolaches. Mix the sugar, cornstarch, and cherry juice in a saucepan. Use a wooden spoon to stir until everything is thoroughly mixed. Put the saucepan on the stove and set it to medium heat. Once the mixture starts boiling and thickening up, turn off the heat and add the pitted cherries. Prepare a blueberry topping. Mix the sugar, cornstarch, salt, blueberries and lemon juice together in a saucepan. Turn the stovetop to medium heat to warm the mixture while continuously stirring. Once the sugar has dissolved, turn the heat on your stovetop down and let the mixture simmer for about ten minutes. The final product should be fairly thick. Create a sweet apricot topping.
