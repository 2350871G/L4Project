You can put a kiwi and a banana together in a paper bag to speed up ripening, or simply place the kiwi next to a banana or an apple in a fruit bowl on your counter. You can also leave kiwis next to tomatoes, apricots, figs, cantaloupe, avocados, pears, and peaches to help them ripen faster."

Ripe kiwis usually last three to four days in the refrigerator."
