If the lilies are in pots without drainage holes, keep them well-watered. If they are in pots with drainage holes, repot them in pots without draining holes.

Remove other tender plants from the pond, wrapping each plant loosely with damp newspaper. Place them in large trash bags and store them with the lilies. Check the newspaper every week or two to be sure it is still moist, but not soaking wet. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b0\\/Prepare-a-Garden-Pond-for-Winter-Step-2Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Prepare-a-Garden-Pond-for-Winter-Step-2Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b0\\/Prepare-a-Garden-Pond-for-Winter-Step-2Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Prepare-a-Garden-Pond-for-Winter-Step-2Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
