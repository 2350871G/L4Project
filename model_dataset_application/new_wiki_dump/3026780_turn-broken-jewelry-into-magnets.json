Even though you may have a piece that is precious it may not be large enough to make a singular statement.

For example, you won\u2019t want to turn a broken ruby ring into a magnet so be sure you separate the extremely valuable pieces from the rest.

Making the Magnets Place a dab of glue on the backside of the magnet. You will want enough glue so the magnet adheres to the jewelry but not too much that it oozes out once you\u2019ve joined the two.
