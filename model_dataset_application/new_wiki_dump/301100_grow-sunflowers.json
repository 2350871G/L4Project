          "description":"While most sunflower varieties grow to be several feet tall, some miniature varieties peak out at under three feet tall. Here's a list of popular varieties, large and small:\n\nMammoth: Their wooly namesakes may have gone extinct, but mammoth sunflowers grow just as tall as the prehistoric beasts, reaching a height of 9 to 12 feet (2.7 to 3.7 meters). Autumn Beauty: This variety produces large flowers that grow up to six inches in diameter. It gets its name from the fall-like spectrum of flowers it produces. Bronze and mahogany flowers are not uncommon on these large stalks that can reach seven feet. Sunbeam: Sunbeam is a medium-sized variety, standing at about five feet tall and producing flowers about five inches in diameter. Sunbeam flower petals are long and asymmetrical, and the flower center is often yellow, making for a dramatic addition to any bouquet. Teddy Bear: This miniature variety caps out at three feet tall and is perfect if you are tight on space in your garden."

If possible, it is also best to shield sunflowers from the wind. Plant sunflower seeds along a fence, the side of a house, or behind a row of sturdy trees. If possible, plant your sunflowers on the north side of your garden. This prevents the large sunflower stalks from shading other plants in your garden."

Your local agricultural extension office should have soil testing forms, bags, and instructions available. After making adjustments to the soil, test the pH level again. If the pH level is below 6.0, enrich the soil using acid compost or planting mix. If the soil pH is above 7.5, mix in granular sulfur to lower the pH level."
