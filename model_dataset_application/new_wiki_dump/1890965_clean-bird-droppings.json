Most standard carpet cleaners or all-purpose household cleaners will be mild enough to work on any kind of carpet, and foaming upholstery cleaners can be found at any supermarket or drugstore. Spray enough cleaner onto the spot to cover what\u2019s left of it. If you do not have any specialized carpet cleaner on hand, you also have the option of mixing up a gentle solution consisting of mild laundry detergent, vinegar and warm water."

If any traces are left after scrubbing, spray a little more cleaner on the spot, let it sit, then make a second attempt. Scrub forcefully to ensure that you get as much of the dried-on mess out of the deeper layers of the carpet as you can.

The constant stream of water should finish the job that wetting the spot started. Go over the stain it\u2019s completely gone. If your hose comes with a head that allows you to adjust the stream, set it to the high-pressure, single stream flow to blast away bird messes. If your hose doesn't have an adjustable head, you can place your thumb halfway over the nozzle to partially block the water flow and produce a higher pressure stream manually."

The bristles will dig into the crevices in the brick, concrete or roofing tile and and scrape away the remaining bird poop.

Spray or blot just enough cleaner onto the spot to cover it; avoid getting excess cleaner on unaffected areas of hardwood or paint. A wash-and-wax cleaner should do the trick on cars. Wash-and-wax solutions are formulated to clean dirt, oil and grime off of cars and leave the topcoat of paint with a freshly-waxed shine. Purchasing special cleaning products is recommended for treating temperamental surfaces, but assuming you don't feel like dropping a lot of money, you can also go the homemade route. A gentle, natural wood polish can be whipped up out of hot water, olive oil and lemon juice, while dish soap diluted with warm water makes a basic but effective solution for cleaning car exteriors."

After all remnants of the spot are removed, dry the area by dabbing it with a dry towel. Microfiber towels are extremely soft and their fibers let them lock in the dirt and water that they soak up, making them ideal for most gentle cleaning jobs.
