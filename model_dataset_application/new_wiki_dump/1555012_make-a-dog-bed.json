          "description":"This is the most important characteristic as you want a box that can be used as a dog bed that has a high level of sturdiness. You'll also need the box to be large enough to accommodate the size of your dog. If your dog has a tendency to sprawl or move around in its sleep, you may want to choose a box that's on the larger side. If you don't have any suitable boxes at home but still want to make a box bed, you can purchase a box relatively cheaply from a shipping store, the post office, or in some cases, an office supply store."

          "headline":"Reinforce your box.",
          "description":"Stress and strain will be put on your box by the simple act of your dog getting into and out of its bed. Over time, this can cause your box to break down or become less structurally sound. To prevent this, apply a durable tape along the edges and sides of the box to reinforce it. Duct tape works very well for the purposes of reinforcing your dog bed as it is very durable. However, you can also use packing tape or other kinds of tape, though these may not hold up as well to wear and tear. You might also want to tape the flaps at the bottom of your box where the box folds together. This can help strengthen the shape of the box and hold it's shape."

          "headline":"Cut an opening for your dog.",
          "description":"Take a pair of scissors or a utility knife and cut a downward pointing U-shaped opening in the box for your dog. For some boxes or dogs, this may only involve you cutting off the top flaps of the box. In other cases, you may have to trim down the sides of the box to make it easier for your dog to enter and exit. You might also want to cut a semi-circular \"main entrance\" for your dog bed. Take your utility knife and cut a semi-circle in the front of your box. This lowered lip of the box will be easier for your dog to enter, making it the default entrance for your pet."

          "headline":"Pad your box for comfort.",
          "description":"Although this is not necessary, padding can provide comfort and warmth to  your pet. For example, if you're making a bed for an outdoor dog, wood chips can help fight insect infestations while insulating the animal from the cold. Indoor pets may have a special blanket or pillow that they often use that can be put in the box bed for additional comfort. You might also use some leftover padding, rags, old clothing, and more to make your box bed more comfortable for your dog."

Also, a regular base will provide a more comfortable resting place for your pet. Much like sleeping on a lumpy mattress can be uncomfortable for you, so too will it be for your pet. You might choose an old, over-sized cushion for the base of your dog bed. To prolong the life of the cushion, you may want to wrap it in a blanket, towel, curtain, and so on. Pillows can also work well, especially for smaller dogs. Much like cushions, you can extend the life of your pet pillow/fabric bed by covering it in a blanket, towel, curtain, and so on. Sewing together the fabric you are using for your dog bed can also help it maintain shape. You could also sew the cloth inside a larger piece of fabric, like a sheet."

You might consider making a pet \"beanbag\" bed. Place a large quantity of unwanted cloth items (towels, rags, shirts, etc.) in the center of an old, unwanted sheet. Tie the edges of the sheet together so it forms a beanbag. To prevent your fabric stuffing from falling out, you may want to stitch closed the opening of your pillowcase or sheet."

Remember, many dogs have dreams of running, which causes their paws to twitch. This can sometimes cause the fabric of the dog bed to bunch up uncomfortably for your pet. You don't need to check your pet bed every day, especially if you've tucked the bed up tightly with a sheet/covering when making it. However, to keep the bed at the max comfort level for you dog, you may want to check it once a week, straightening and smoothing the fabric when necessary."
