Place paper towels, napkins or hand towels near the sick for easy access. Display large plants or decorative objects in the center of the island for an aesthetic appeal.

Your kitchen island should serve its purpose of being a convenient spot for household items, but it should also be a warm and welcoming space that is open and inviting. Adding clutter to your countertop can detract from this, so be sure to keep your countertop items to a minimum! Keep your kitchen island clutter-free on a regular basis by putting items back where they belong as soon as you are finished with them. If your kitchen island has a breakfast nook, clear off any dishes after you have finished your meal. If you often have random objects lying around, you can designate a basket, tray or bowl to miscellaneous items."
