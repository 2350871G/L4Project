You want to remove as much of the spilled liquid as possible before it soaks into the carpet. Be careful not to scrub the carpet with the cloth to avoid working the soda further into the carpet and damaging the carpet fibers. Determine the carpeting material. It's important to know what material the carpet is made from so that you can choose the correct cleaning solution and application method. Check on the underside of area rugs for a label. The label should list the carpet material. Contact the manufacturer if you need to find out from which material wall-to-wall carpeting is made. Gather cleaning supplies. You will need 3 to 4 white cloths or a roll of non-patterned paper towels, a gentle non-bleach detergent, lukewarm water, 2 to 3 bowls, 2 spray bottles, white vinegar, and a heavy, flat-bottomed object you can use as a weight.

Use only 8 oz. (.24 L) water if it is a set in soda stain. Prepare a vinegar solution. Add white vinegar and water to a bowl in a 1 to 2 ratio. Perform a spot test. Dab a little of the detergent and vinegar solutions on an inconspicuous area of the carpet. Wait until the solution dries and then check to make sure there is no stain or lightening of the carpet. Dip a white cloth or paper towel into the bowl of prepared detergent solution.  Pat the soda stain with the cloth or paper towel.  Press gently for a few seconds and remove the cloth or paper towel.  Wait 15 minutes to allow the detergent time to help break down the stain.  Dab the carpet with a dry cloth to soak up the detergent solution.
