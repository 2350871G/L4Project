The easiest way to locate studs if to use a \"stud finder\" available at many hardware stores. You can also try tapping the wall lightly with a hammer and moving slowly across the wall and listening closely.

Wire the new receptacle first and then go back and connect the new wire to the existing circuit. Cut sheathing off Romex about 8 inches (20.3 cm) long.Your home may use 12- or 14-gauge wires. Check the circuit breaker to determine the correct amperage. Note that #14/2+g is 15-amp rated wire and uses a 15-amp circuit breaker, while #12/2+g is 20-amp rated wire and uses a 20-amp circuit breaker. You should use wire that is proper for the power rating of that circuit and of the same size as the wire you are connecting to.

Inside the electrical cable, there are 3 conductor wires, typically black, white, and copper wire with no insulation. On the receptacle itself, there are 2 brass screws where the un-grounded or hot conductors attach, 2 silver screws for the grounded conductor or neutral conductors, and 1 green screw for the equipment ground conductor. Hook the bare copper wire around the ground wire screw and tighten the screw down. Strip the insulation \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) off the end of the white wire. Bend a hook on the end of the wire using pliers, then put the hook around 1 of silver screws and tighten the screw in a clockwise direction. The other silver screw isn\u2019t used. The black wire goes to the brass screw. Do the same thing: strip the wire, make a hook, and tighten the screw down.

Take all 3 black wires together so the ends are matched up. The end of the new wire should meet the end of the old wire, and one end of the pigtail. The pigtail wire is the one that will be reconnected to the receptacle. Get a wire nut (plastic cone) that just screws onto the wire to connect them. Use lineman\u2019s pliers to twist the 3 black wires together, then twist on an appropriately-sized wire nut. The same goes for white and ground wires, respectively. Take the other end of the pigtail and attach it to the screws the same way as before: green goes to green, white goes silver, black goes to bronze. Older houses might have different types of wires, so you may need to consult an electrician if yours don\u2019t match up."

Most electricians will do this after installation, to make sure the new circuit isn't stressing the source. To do this, turn on the circuit and everything connected to it so they\u2019re drawing power.
