Remember that a tile is split into a grid of 9, so a building will take up a certain amount of those squares. Each square in the grid can have a zombie and a bullet token or a life token, but never all 3 at once. A player can pick up life tokens and bullet tokens if they enter the square on the grid where they have been placed. If a zombie occupies the tile too, the player must remove them before picking up the token."

These zombies may be placed on any legal road square (using the grid of 9)."

Playing a Typical Turn Play an event card. Starting with the player left of the dealer, choose 1 event card and play it on your turn. This will change the rules of your oncoming turn, hopefully making it easier. 'Alternate Food Source' is an event card that prevents any zombies from attacking you on your turn. Use this event card to make the most of your movement and get past any barricades made by other players. Draw a map tile and place it on the table. After playing an event card the player must draw a map tile. They can choose where to place this map tile, as long as it obeys the map tile placement rules. The player should consider how to benefit his road to victory, but hinder his opponent's. Combat any zombies on the player's character space. Next, the character should deal with any zombies that have been moved into their space by another player. Use the normal combat rules to determine how the encounter plays out. If you lose your final life token, you must move back to the 'Town Square' tile. You do not get an opportunity to roll for movement. Draw back up to 3 event cards. Now that your event card is in play, draw as many cards from the event deck as you need so that you have 3 event cards again. Make a movement roll and move your character. Roll a 6-sided die to determine your movement. Then, with this number, move your character wherever you desire as long as it abides by the movement rules. Remember, if you move into a space occupied by a zombie you must enter combat before continuing your movement. If you enter a tile that has a life token, or a bullet token, but no zombie, you can pick it up at no cost and continue your movement. Roll a die for the zombie movement. Once your character has exhausted their movement, the player must then roll a 6-sided die for zombie movement. The number the die shows determines how many zombies the player can choose to move 1 space in any direction (except diagonal). Use this opportunity to move zombies into opponent's character spaces or to block their progress towards their goal. Discard 1 event card and end your turn. Once you have finished all your actions, discard 1 of your 3 events cards into the event deck and end your turn. Play continues clockwise until a player reaches 25 zombie kills or someone reaches the 'Heliport' tile.",
