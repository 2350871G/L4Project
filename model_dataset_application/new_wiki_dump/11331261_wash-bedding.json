Look for specific instructions for which cycle to use, what water temperature is safest, and whether they can be washed with other things. If your cotton or microfiber sheets don\u2019t have a care label, it\u2019s likely safe to wash them on a normal cycle with cool or warm water."

If you have white sheets that are stained or need to be lightened, you can use bleach for these. Look for a laundry spot treatment at your local big box or grocery store. OxiClean is a popular option for getting rid of stains, or you can opt for a more gentle stain remover like distilled white vinegar or baking soda."

Otherwise, add the detergent directly to the washer. Read the instructions on your detergent pod pack to be sure you\u2019re using them correctly. It\u2019s said to be best to add the detergent to your washing machine before you add your load of laundry if you\u2019re putting it directly into the washer drum (this is true for pods as well).

If you have a large washing machine, you can likely place two sets of sheets in there. If your washer isn\u2019t super big, it\u2019s best to just add one set. Never wrap your sheets around the agitator (the spindle that sticks up in the middle of the washing machine). It could cause them to tear.
