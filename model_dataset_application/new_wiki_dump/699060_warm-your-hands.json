If your body doesn\u2019t think your organs are in danger, it won\u2019t take warming blood away from your hands. In cooler weather, layer your clothing, wear a base layer, an insulating layer, and an outer layer that protects from wind and rain."

To combat this, wear loose clothes that are comfortable and provide you with freedom of movement. If you are wearing tight clothes and your hands get cold, change into looser clothes as soon as you can."

Put your hands in your pockets if you don\u2019t have gloves, or stick them inside your jacket to keep them out of the breeze."
