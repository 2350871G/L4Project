Asian pears keep much longer in the fridge than on the table\u20143 months versus 1 week\u2014so it's best to keep them refrigerated. If you like to eat them at room temperature, just let the pear sit on the counter for about an hour before eating it. Rinse the pear and pat it dry with a clean towel before cutting or eating it."

          "description":"Use a sharp chef's knife or cleaver to chop straight down through the top of the pear. Then, cut each hemisphere in half to create 4 equal quarters. Asian pears are firm like apples, and most varieties have the same shape as apples, so you can use the same cutting techniques for both. If you prefer to core your apples before cutting them, or if you like to use a dedicated apple corer/slicer gadget, you can do the same with Asian pears."

          "headline":"Trim out the core with a paring knife.",
          "description":"As with apples, you'll find a tough core with seeds in the middle of Asian pears. Pick up each pear quarter and use a paring knife to carve out and discard the core section. You should be able to see where the harder, drier core ends and the juicier, more delicate fruit begins. You can also feel the difference with your finger in order to help determine your cut."

          "headline":"Peel off the skin if desired.",
          "description":"The skin of Asian pears is perfectly fine to eat, and eating it means you'll consume even more healthy fiber. However, if you prefer to remove it, just slide your paring knife under the skin and peel it away from each quarter section. Alternatively, you could use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin before you begin cutting into the pear. If you plan on presenting a plate of thin slices of pear to your guests, removing the skin may be more aesthetically pleasing."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cut thin slices and serve them immediately.",
          "description":"Use your paring knife to cut each quarter into 4 or more thin slices. Asian pears are so crisp that they can be cut into very thin slices with a sharp knife. Asian pear slices usually don't brown as quickly as apples, but they will start to turn soon after you cut them. Browning doesn't affect the flavor, but it does lessen the visual appeal."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Bite into it just like an apple for a quicker fix.",
          "description":"If you're not concerned with fancy presentation, or just want something you can eat while walking to the bus stop, don't worry about cutting the pear. Just rinse and dry the skin, then eat it out-of-hand. An Asian pear makes a great hand fruit\u2014it combines the convenience of an apple with the distinctive sweetness of a pear.

Depending on the prominence of the apple flavor in the recipe, you may notice a distinctive pear flavor instead.
