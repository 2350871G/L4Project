      "headline":"Choose your balloons.",
      "description":"Depending on how you plan to use this decoration, count the number of balloons you plan to use. The balloon color will end up representing the ice cream itself so dark brown balloons could be chocolate, white might be vanilla, pink could become strawberry, etc. Consider the balloon size in relation to how you will build the cone. The cone will simply be made from butcher block paper that has been rolled into a cone so make sure the cone and balloon match. Select balloon colors based on your overall theme (if you have one). Choose colors that will compliment and not overpower the room or area you plan to decorate."

    {
      "headline":"Blow up balloons using a helium tank.",
      "description":"While you can blow up the balloons the old fashioned way (using your own air), the only way they will stand upright is to use helium. Set blown up balloons in a large plastic bag or in an area where they won\u2019t float or blow away."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Assemble the first ice cream cone.",
      "description":"Cut out a large rectangle from the butcher block paper. For a standard size balloon, cut out a rectangle that is approximately 12\" x 6\". You want the top of the cone to hold the balloon in place nicely. Shape the cut piece of butcher block paper into a cone shape with a pointed bottom and open-mouthed top. Add pieces of clear tape along the seam to hold in place."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Place balloon on top of the cone.",
      "description":"Once you've made sure the balloon fits in place (and looks good), add clear pieces of rolled tape along the inside of the cone. The tape should be close enough to the inside edge so the base of the balloon is held in place. Be sure you tape the balloon with the knotted side of the balloon facing inside the cone."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Punch a small hole toward the base of the cone and add the ribbon.",
      "description":"Thread a piece of ribbon through the hole and tie a knot toward the top. The ribbon should keep the entire ice cream cone in tact and able to tie on a chair or gift."
