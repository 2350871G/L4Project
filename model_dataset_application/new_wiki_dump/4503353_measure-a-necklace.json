          "description":"Neck size is probably the most important measurement for determining which necklace length will work best for you. To measure, wrap a soft tape measure around your neck, keeping the tape measure parallel to the floor as you measure. Then, add 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) to your neck measurement to calculate your minimum recommended chain length. If you are a person with a neck size measuring 13 (33 cm) to 14 \u00bd inches (36.8 cm), an 18-inch (45.7 cm) necklace is a good choice for necklace length. If you have a neck size measuring 15 (38 cm) to 16 \u00bd inches (41.2 cm), a 20-inch (50.8 cm) necklace would be a good choice. If your neck size measures 17 (43.2 cm) to 18 \u00bd inches (47 cm), a 22-inch (55.9 cm) necklace would be a good option for you."

          "description":"If you cannot customize the necklace length to your neck size, simply choose the second size up from your neck size as your minimum necklace measurement. For instance, if you are a person with a neck size measuring 17 inches (43 cm), your minimum standard should be 20 inches (50 cm) instead of 18 inches (45 cm)."

          "description":"In addition to neck size, your height can also change the position of a necklace around your neck. Long necklaces can overwhelm shorter people, and short necklaces can get lost on taller people. If your height is below 5 feet (1.5 m) 4 inches (162 cm), stick with necklaces measuring between 16 and 20 inches (40 and 50 cm). For people with heights between 5 feet (1.5 m) 4 inches (162 cm) and 5 feet (1.5 m) 7 inches (170 cm), necklaces of any length should work well. People with a height of 5 feet (1.5 m) 7 inches (170 cm) or taller look best in longer necklaces."

          "headline":"Choose a size to flatter your body type.",
          "description":"Just as different clothes flatter different parts of the body, different necklace lengths accentuate different parts of the body. If you have a slighter body type, a short, thin chain is a great choice. For a fuller figure, a slightly longer and thicker chain is flattering. If you want to accent the bust, choose a necklace that draws attention to the area just below the collarbone and above the bust. Usually, 20 to 22 inch (50 to 55 cm) necklaces will do the trick. If you have a flatter, less prominent bust, thin chains measuring around 22 inches (55 cm) tend to have an elegant look."

          "headline":"Balance a length to your face shape.",
          "description":"Necklaces can subtly make your face appear wider, narrower, longer, or shorter depending on the natural shape of your face. As such, different necklace measurements can flatter certain face shapes better than others. Some styles that work well on different face shapes are:\nA choker length necklace measuring between 10 and 16 inches (25 and 40 cm) can help soften the sharp angle of the chin on people with heart-shaped faces. This tactic also works well for those who have rectangular and oblong faces. People with round faces should avoid short necklaces since these chains tend to make the face appear even rounder. Longer necklaces measuring between 26 and 36 inches (66 and 91 cm) elongate the jawline better. If you have an oval shaped face, all necklace lengths should be equally flattering."

A necklace measuring 28 to 34 inches (71 to 86 cm) hang at or below the bust and are usually wrapped around the neck twice.
