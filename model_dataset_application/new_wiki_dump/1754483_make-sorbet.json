If you are using a very sweet fruit, you might want to use a bit less sugar. A tart fruit (such as lemon) may require a bit more sugar.

Dissolving the sugar in water makes the texture more even and allows it to blend into the pureed fruit more easily. However, some sorbet purists point out that the use of as simple syrup waters down the flavor of sorbet (by adding water). If you do choose to use simple syrup, dissolve 1 cup of sugar into 1 cup boiling (or near-boiling) water. Then allow the solution to cool completely. You can either add the cooled simple syrup to the pureed fruit or add the pureed fruit to simple syrup while it is still hot (in the pan) and allow the mixture to cool together."
