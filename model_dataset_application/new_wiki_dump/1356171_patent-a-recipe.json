It's very difficult to determine whether a particular mix of ingredients has been whipped up in someone's kitchen before.

Search the United States Patent and Trademark Office database to see if your recipe has already been patented. Search cookbooks and the Internet for your recipe.

          "description":"If your recipe involves a technique or combination of ingredients that leads to unique, non-obvious results, it may be patentable. However, if your recipe is something that could easily be thought up by someone else, or involves techniques that lead to predictable results, it's probably not patentable. Since most recipes invented by home cooks don't lead to results that would surprise a seasoned cook, they usually aren't patentable. Food companies are more likely to create recipes that are patentable, because they are able to use experimental processes and ingredients that lead to non-obvious results. For example, a patentable recipe might be one that uses a new technique to give it a surprisingly long shelf life. Simply adding a unique ingredient to a recipe isn't non-obvious enough to make it patentable. For example, an experimental home cook might decide to add cinnamon to a meatloaf recipe. Though the results might be surprisingly delicious, most home chefs could predict the flavor change that the addition of cinnamon would bring about."

The application cover sheet and list of required attachments can be obtained from the United States Patent and Trademark Office website, at uspto.gov.

After you pay an issue and publication fee, your patent will be granted. The vast majority of patent applications are routinely rejected. You should not take it personally. Examiners are required to enforce the rules diligently and it often works out to your advantage, resulting in a more valuable patent. If your application is rejected you have an opportunity to argue or to amend (narrow) the claims or to appeal the examiners' final decision. This often takes several years and thousands of dollars in filing fees and attorneys' fees. If your application is finally rejected and you abandon it, and you still want to protect your recipe, you can do so by  protecting it as a trade secret. Those who know the secret will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and in this way you can prevent your recipe from getting leaked."
