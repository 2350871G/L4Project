Some shotguns have threading or another method at the end of the barrel to allow you to easily change a choke depending on your needs. For defensive use, cylinder bore (or basically no choke at all) and sometimes improved cylinder (IC) chokes are most common. These allow the shot to spread out quickly and increase the chance of hitting your target. However, at longer ranges (greater than 20yds or so) the shot spreads out too much and will not be able to guarantee a good hit. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7c\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7c\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nAnother benefit of shooting shot from a shotgun is the inherent lack of penetration. For home protection, lighter shot will likely become less than lethal once it goes through a wall, protecting innocent family members or neighbors. Typically, the penetration is proportional to the size of the shot (for example, large buckshot is still capable of substantial penetration.) Although the \"best\" size is a hotly debated topic, smaller bird shot and skeet/clay target sized shot at close range can be very effective. Shotgun barrels range in length from 18.5 inch (47.0 cm) \"home defense\" barrels to 24 inch (61.0 cm) hunting barrels. Also, many shotguns are made so the barrel can be changed easily. This way, you can put a short barrel on for home defense, and a long barrel for hunting or busting clays. Don't forget to practice with your short barrel, though. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/97\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet6.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/97\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet6.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

  "text":" Handguns While the size, weight, and design of the handgun makes them the most common choice for personal defense (they're carried with minimal discomfort or exposure), this forces them to use a weaker cartridge for repeated shots with relative ease.  The concealability of handguns lends them to be the most used gunfight weapon. If you aren't expecting trouble, you bring something easy to manage. Reliability is the number one aspect to look at when selecting a personal or home defense weapon.  Selecting a Caliber Caliber selection in pistols is a hot source of debate amongst tactics-minded handgun users. While the general stopping power of a pistol is measurably low compared to almost any long gun, you want to make an informed choice to give you the best advantage. Smaller calibers, such as .380, 9mm, etc, generally result in a higher bullet velocity, reduced recoil which allows for fast follow-up shots, higher capacity magazines (or smaller framed guns), and higher velocity bullets. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/ff\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/ff\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nLarge calibers, such as the venerable .45 feature slower bullets that have increased overall diameter, allowing for a wider initial wound channel (which gives you a slightly increased chance of hitting something vital).

Most U.S. self-defense experts consider .380 ACP (9 x 17 mm Browning Short) or 9mm as the minimum for adequate defense, while European Police believe that .32 ACP (7.65 x 17 mm Browning) as adequate. Making an informed decision about what caliber you will use requires experience. Shoot many different calibers and choose the biggest caliber that you can comfortably shoot and make fast, accurate followup shots with. Don't completely disregard a .22 if your objective is home defense. A semi-automatic .22 pistol or Ruger 10/22 carbine with a high-capacity magazine is easy to control when shooting fast and can be very effective at close range (most home-defense shots occur at less than 7 yards), and .22 ammunition is very cheap. Furthermore, a .22 won't penetrate as many walls, thus reducing property damage and risk to your neighbors if you miss. When making your decision, also keep in mind the cost of ammunition! You'll want to be able to easily afford enough ammunition to keep up a regular practice routine. Frame Size Handguns come in all shapes and sizes. From derringers that are only two or three inches long, to what are jokingly called \"hand cannons\" that can be 12 or more inches long. For those who are expecting to carry a concealed handgun, a lighter, polymer framed firearm is often preferred over a heavier metal framed firearm because the weight of the firearm can become burdensome over time. Heavier belts are available, however, to mitigate the effect of weight. Smaller handguns also aid concealment as they are easier to hide under clothing. For home defense, or openly carried handguns, it makes sense to have a larger frame. The longer slide will aid accuracy by increasing the distance between the front and rear sights, and the heavier weight will reduce recoil and allow for faster followup shots. Choosing a mid-sized frame can allow for more versatility, owing to a compromise between weight and size that will allow you to use the handgun in more roles.  Pistols Pistols represent newer handgun technology than revolvers (though John Browning invented the idea of a slide enclosed barrel around 1900). Many law enforcement and militaries around the world rely on pistols for their sidearms. A pistol usually keeps its ammunition in a spring loaded box of metal called a magazine (not a clip as is commonly misunderstood). The pistol primes itself for the next shot through the action of a slide - a piece of metal that covers the barrel. The forces of the gasses propelling the bullet from the barrel after it is fired push backwards on the slide, causing it to travel to the rear and pulling/ejecting the spent shell from the gun, at which time a spring compressed by the rearward action pushes the slide forward, which causes the slide to catch the rear of another cartridge from the magazine, pushing it into the barrel. Early pistols were plagued by reliability problems. In the past 50 years, however, the reliability of semi-automatic handguns has improved markedly as compared to revolvers. To some degree, a more expensive, name brand handgun may perform more reliably than a very inexpensive one. While you don't have to spend thousands of dollars, expect to pay at least $400US for a brand new semi-automatic handgun with a reasonable level of quality. Cost is not the only consideration though; the best gun is the one you actually have with you - it's better to have an inexpensive gun that no gun at all (assuming it's reliable).  Pistols have a number of advantages over revolvers: They are magazine fed, which means that after you have depleted anywhere between 5 and 33 rounds (depending on the model of the handgun, the capacity of the magazine, and applicable state/local laws), you can quickly change magazines and get back into the fight. (Note that this only holds true for as many magazines as you have pre-loaded with ammunition. Reloading a magazine under stress with loose rounds can take a painfully long amount of time, or be nearly impossible to complete due to the decreased motor skills caused by the effects of large amounts of adrenaline. ){\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/af\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/af\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nThe force required to operate the slide on the firearm makes them much more desirable for multiple-shot encounters as the slide's action dampens the recoil to some degree. This allows for faster and more accurate follow-up shots.

In the case where a cartridge fails to feed properly into the chamber, a pistol is rendered inoperable until the stoppage is cleared, whereas with a revolver, pulling the trigger again when a cartridge fails to fire will rotate the cylinder, bringing a new cartridge into line with the firing pin. This drawback to a pistol requires extra training and practice ensure the steps to clear the stoppage and return the firearm to working order can be performed instinctually. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/88\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-18Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-18Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/88\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-18Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-18Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nThe multiple moving parts of a pistol means that in general, they are chambered for less powerful calibers than Revolvers. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a2\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-18Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-18Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a2\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-18Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-18Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Revolvers Revolvers have been a popular firearm choice since they were invented. Their ultra-simple mechanics make them very easy to manufacture, and their basic design has been around for centuries. Revolvers allow you to fire between four and eight rounds in succession without reloading. Ammunition is stored in a round piece of metal called a \"cylinder\", which rotates when the hammer is cocked or the trigger is pulled (depending on the \"action\" of the revolver). If a round fails to fire, simply cocking the hammer or pulling the trigger again (depending on the capabilities of the revolver) will rotate the cylinder for a new cartridge. The advantages to choosing a revolver: Reliability is the most attractive feature of a revolver. A standard shooter would have a hard time making a spurless (hammerless), double-action revolver not shoot when the trigger is pulled. The design is simple, and the use is even simpler: pick up a loaded gun, disengage the safety (if applicable), and pull the trigger, and it will fire. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/57\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-21Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-21Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/57\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-21Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-21Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nSimpler operation means that a new shooter is more easily able to unload a revolver.

If you are not willing to devote time and effort to learn the skills, don't endanger others by trying to use one under stress. Handgun marksmanship is considered a sport because it takes training and skill. For first time handgun owners, revolvers are probably the better choice as they are simpler. Typically they hold 5-6 rounds which is enough so that you will not have to reload during most home defense incidents. For more experienced users, or users willing to take a formal instruction, a semi-automatic handgun may make more sense due to their increased capacity and easier follow-up shots. Operation takes a bit more learning and practice, but the positives are why the majority of law enforcement and military personnel carry semi-automatic handguns. Every person is different. A firearm that \"fits\" my hand perfectly will not feel right to you. Most firearm owners are happy to allow a novice to try a couple of shots. Do your research, test fire a few weapons before you invest. When hunting, a larger caliber may be required as many dangerous game have tough skin and muscles the need the extra energy to penetrate through skin and muscle to reach vital organs. Many lower-power cartridges may not penetrate deeply enough to cause incapacitating damage. Long Guns It has been said, \"Pack a handgun for the unexpected, but if you know you'll be in a gunfight, always grab a bigger gun!\" Handguns lack power. A high-end .44 Magnum pistol will produce about 1,000 ft/lb of muzzle energy; a traditional \"varmint\" caliber, the .223, will produce about 50% more energy, and high-end rifles produce over 10,000 ft/lb! The main advantages of long guns are power and accuracy. With a bit of practice, a decent shooter can hit a man sized target at greater than 300 yards (274.3 m) with the proper rifle, due to the more powerful round, longer barrel and the longer sight-base (the distance between the front and rear sights). Shotguns Shotguns can have either smooth or rifled bores. They are used to fire large caliber \"shells\" that contain either shot (a multiple quantity of metal pellets) or a single large slug. The advantages of a shotgun: The biggest benefit of shotguns is their ability to shoot shot (and just about anything else). The spreading out of the shot when fired allows a larger area to be hit with each trigger pull, reducing the requirement for precision shooting, and, depending on the type of ammunition and range, can cause greater damage than a single bullet from a handgun. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e3\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e3\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nSome shotguns have the flexibility of shooting shot or bullet-type projectiles (known as \"slugs\").

Most modern shotguns can be outfitted with different length barrels, stocks, fore ends, sights and many other accessories to fit your needs. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3c\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3c\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nThe use of chokes, a narrowing \"funnel\"-like section at the end of the barrel, allows you to control how much the shot disperses out of the end of the barrel. Some shotguns have threading or another method at the end of the barrel to allow you to easily change a choke depending on your needs. For defensive use, cylinder bore (or basically no choke at all) and sometimes improved cylinder (IC) chokes are most common. These allow the shot to spread out quickly and increase the chance of hitting your target. However, at longer ranges (greater than 20yds or so) the shot spreads out too much and will not be able to guarantee a good hit. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7c\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7c\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nAnother benefit of shooting shot from a shotgun is the inherent lack of penetration. For home protection, lighter shot will likely become less than lethal once it goes through a wall, protecting innocent family members or neighbors. Typically, the penetration is proportional to the size of the shot (for example, large buckshot is still capable of substantial penetration.) Although the \"best\" size is a hotly debated topic, smaller bird shot and skeet/clay target sized shot at close range can be very effective. Shotgun barrels range in length from 18.5 inch (47.0 cm) \"home defense\" barrels to 24 inch (61.0 cm) hunting barrels. Also, many shotguns are made so the barrel can be changed easily. This way, you can put a short barrel on for home defense, and a long barrel for hunting or busting clays. Don't forget to practice with your short barrel, though. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/97\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet6.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/97\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet6.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-31Bullet6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} There are some disadvantages as well: Although a shotgun firing shot will produce a spread much larger than a solid projectile, it does not preclude the need to aim.

That said, most self defense encounters happen well within range of a shotgun. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/72\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-32Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-32Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/72\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-32Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-32Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nShotguns with heavy loads, such as 00 buck, can kick pretty hard, making them potentially difficult to control without practice. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e6\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-32Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-32Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/e\\/e6\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-32Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-32Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Rifles Rifles are what most people envision when they think of a long gun. Rifles are designed to fire a single projectile, often smaller than most pistol bullets, at a much higher rate of speed. Rifles have a smaller cousin called a \"carbine\". Carbines are usually lighter in weight, and are shorter barreled (and stocked) than full blown rifles. They often fire the same cartridges, however due to their length they are often chambered in smaller, less powerful calibers. Rifle advantages: Unlike pistol bullets, which typically create narrow permanent wound channels, the greatly increased speed of rifle bullets create a shock wave that can permanently destroy large amounts of tissue, greatly increasing your chances of stopping the threat with a single reasonably placed shot. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/be\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-35Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-35Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/be\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-35Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-35Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nRifle cartridges are far more powerful than handgun cartridges.

Home defense situations may require you to place the stock below your shoulder, reducing your accuracy. Movement around corners and through doors may be hampered by your barrel preceding you through the door, warning an enemy that you're there. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/08\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-36Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-36Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/08\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-36Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-36Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":346,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":571.0439560439561,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nRifles are also more capable of \"over penetration\". This is where the bullet passes through an object, such as a wall, or your intended target and continue on with enough force to injure or kill. Over penetration can be mitigated through proper ammunition choice, but is always a serious consideration with rifles. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/84\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-36Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-36Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/84\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-36Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-36Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nRifle ammunition is much more expensive than handgun ammunition.

Compared to a pistol, swinging a rifle around to engage a threat can take longer, and in a self defense situation, lost time can be deadly. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/af\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-36Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-36Bullet4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/af\\/Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-36Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Choose-a-Firearm-for-Personal-or-Home-Defense-Step-36Bullet4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Long Gun Conclusion Carrying a long gun is more difficult, due to its size and weight, but the greater velocity and power of the bullets delivers much better results with a hit than a handgun.  That said, for defense within the home, the shotgun is generally recognized by many to be a superior choice due to the close ranges and reduced likelihood of over penetration. The sound of a shotgun being racked delivers the universal message that says \"wrong house, go away\".",
