Mosaic Countertop Application Stir your ceramic tile adhesive. Tile adhesive and caulk are available at home improvement stores. Apply the adhesive to your countertop surface with a trowel. Spread it evenly before placing your tile on the surface. Place your tiles onto the adhesive 1 by 1, according to your design. Place them approximately 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) apart from the next tile, to create the mosaic look. Make sure not to press them too deep into the adhesive, as the top should remain clean, with room for grout on the sides. Continue adding tiles to your mosaic until all of the pieces are placed on the countertop. Allow the tiles to dry for 24 hours, or as long as the adhesive directions indicate.
