These should also be the same width, but narrower, and somewhat \"pulled in\" from the edges of the horizontal ones. Now, inside the \"frame\" made by those four rectangles, draw two triangles towards the center, the tops of which should overlap.  Following the triangles (red) draw slightly curved lines- this is the contour of the hourglass. The connecting point of the lines should also be curved. Erase the red lines with a rubber.  Draw two curved lines which would represent the level of the sand. Note: the bottom line should be more curved than the top line. Also, the more sand has already flown, the closer these lines should be to each other, and the more intense should the curves be. Draw another intensely curved line at the middle of the hourglass representing the sand falling through.  Color in the sand and draw a straight line (the flow of the sand).
