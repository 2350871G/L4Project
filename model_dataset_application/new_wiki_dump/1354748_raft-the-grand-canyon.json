          "description":"The Grand Canyon sees most of its tourism in the summer between May and September. This is when the chilly water of the Colorado River will be most hospitable. However, you might also consider planning your trip for one of the bookend months of April or October, when the river and other nearby natural areas tend to be less crowded. One neat thing about the water in the Grand Canyon is that it originates from a man-made reservoir, so it never gets much colder than about 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C). This means that water temperature won\u2019t be as much of a concern if you schedule your trip later in the year."

          "headline":"Consider how long you have to spend on your adventure.",
          "description":"The majority of guided trips led by commercial rafting companies can be completed in a single afternoon. Self-guided outings, however, can take quite a bit longer, as they tend to be less tightly regimented. Don\u2019t forget to factor in travel time to and from your launch site when determining a time frame that works for you. Most rafting companies organize outings by length. For example, you might sign up for a half-day, 2-day, 5-day, 7-day, 10-day, or 15-day trip, depending on who you book with. All-in-all, it takes an average of about 15 days to raft the entire length of the Grand Canyon\u2019s waterways. The various sections of the river can be traversed in hours or days."

          "headline":"Select the type of raft you want to take.",
          "description":"Unlike some other notable whitewater destinations, you have a few different means of conveyance to choose from when rafting the Grand Canyon. Many shorter trips take place in motorized rafts, which offer a more leisurely sightseeing experience. You also have the option of paddling an oar-powered raft or old-fashioned wooden dory if you want to test your skills and get a little exercise. Be sure to specify the type of raft you want to reserve when you book your trip. Your choice of vessel may determine the specific route you end up taking. You can even kayak sections of the Colorado River with a special permit. Kayaking can be an exciting alternative to group rafting for advanced solo paddlers craving a challenge."

        {
          "headline":"Schedule a guided trip with an area rafting company.",
          "description":"Get in touch with one of the many commercial outfitters operating in the Grand Canyon to set up a reservation. Guided trips won\u2019t typically need to be booked more than about a day ahead of time. They can fill up quickly, though, so the earlier you reserve your slot, the better. One of the biggest perks of going through a rafting company is that they\u2019ll take care of all the important planning, including travel routes, departure times, and meal breaks. Commercial outfitters provide rafts, oars, life vests, helmets, and all other necessary equipment to their guests. If you plan on making a self-guided trip, you\u2019ll need to bring these things yourself.Tip: Unless you\u2019re an experienced whitewater enthusiast, it\u2019s recommended that you opt for a guided trip your first time around."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Apply for a permit for self-guided trips at least one year in advance.",
          "description":"If you\u2019re a veteran rafter determined to brave the river on your own, your first step will be to fill out a Diamond Creek to Lake Mead Permit Application. You must submit your completed application to the United States National Park Service no earlier than one year prior to your intended launch date. Be aware that permits are granted on a first-come, first-served basis, so there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll receive one. It doesn\u2019t cost anything to submit an application. However, the Hualapai tribe who owns the surrounding land does charge a small access fee to adventurers crossing through their territory. You\u2019ll need to make arrangements with the tribe on your own by calling 928-769-2210. The National Park Service only authorizes two non-commercial trips to set out from the Diamond Creek launch site per day. Each outing is restricted to a total of 16 participants."

        {
          "headline":"Be prepared to hike the Bright Angel Trail to reach your launch site.",
          "description":"Both Upper and Lower Canyon routes start with a long foot trek through Bright Angel Trail. The trail, which spans 8 miles (13 km) and climbs around 5,000 feet (1,500 m) in elevation, as been rated \u201cstrenuous\u201d by the National Park Service. Due to its difficulty, the hike is only recommended to adventurers who are in good physical condition. If you don\u2019t think you\u2019re up to the challenge, you also have the option of scheduling a 3-5-day Western Canyon trip or 6-18-day Full Canyon trip, both of which end with a helicopter or car ride out of the Canyon. The craggy, sun-baked trail is well-maintained, but offers little shade, so make sure you bring plenty of water."

          "description":"A sudden change in the weather has the potential to severely complicate a routine pleasure trip. Guided outings may even be cancelled if river conditions become too tumultuous. If the forecast doesn\u2019t look promising, it may be safest to put your trip on hold until you see clearer skies. Monitoring the weather will also give you a better idea of what types of items you\u2019ll need to bring with you. If you obtained a permit for a solo venture, it can\u2019t be cancelled due to dangerous weather. Keep in mind that if you decide to go ahead with your trip, you\u2019ll be doing so at your own risk."

It\u2019s also a good idea to keep a life preserver or rope bag onboard your raft, plus a first aid kit containing pain relievers and supplies for treating minor wounds. It may be possible to rent some or all of your rafting equipment on-site once you arrive at the Grand Canyon.

Wearing multiple layers will allow you to shed or pull on additional items as needed as the temperature changes. Ideally, most of your clothing should be made from quick-drying materials like nylon, neoprene, polyester, or wool. Items like a waterproof jacket, insulated paddling gloves, and a hat with a bill or visor and strap are a must. Don\u2019t forget to pack a few spare dry garments for the journey back. Kicking around in soggy clothes isn\u2019t very comfortable.Tip: Make room for everything you think you\u2019ll need, but avoid cramming your travel bag too full.

You\u2019re in for a treat, as the atmosphere of the Grand Canyon National Park makes for some of the best camping in the U.S. You\u2019ll fall asleep beneath the open sky with rushing waters at your side and wake up to the spectacular sight of the sunrise glowing on the red rocks of the looming canyon walls.
