While the curve of the upside-down 'U' should take up as much of the bottle's width as possible, the legs of the 'U' only need to go halfway down the length of the bottle.

  "text":" Hanging Your Phone by Its Cord Plug your charger in and form a loop with the loose cord.

The charging cord will rest on top of the adapter, letting your phone balance on the bottom of the loop you created. You may need to reposition your phone until it's perfectly balanced on the cord.

Creating a Phone Holder Out of Fabric Cut fabrics to make 11 in \u00d7 6 in (28 cm \u00d7 15 cm) upside-down \u2018U\u2019 shapes.

Only sew the left, right, and bottom edge of the rectangle, leaving the top edge loose to create the pocket. Cut a large hole in the top of the upside-down \u2018U\u2019 shape. Create a hole large enough to fit over the hook you\u2019ll use or your phone charger\u2019s adapter.
