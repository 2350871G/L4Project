          "headline":"Aim for symmetry.",
          "description":"To help your buffet table appear well-organized, your decorations should be relatively symmetrical on either side. This will give your table a great, balanced look. Try to imagine a line splitting the buffet table in half and try to create a mirror image on either side of the line. For example, if you have a candlestick about six inches tall on one end of the buffet, try to place an item about as tall on the other end. You could have a candlestick on one end and a plant on the other. You could try having a pattern in regards to the height and shape of objects. Towards the middle of the buffet, place shorter objects. Have the objects get bigger as you move outward."

          "headline":"Group items by type.",
          "description":"This can give your buffet an organized feel. You don't necessarily have to group the exact same objects together. However, you can group objects of similar colors and shapes together. For example, try grouping together items of a similar color and height. A crimson book can be paired next to a short red figurine, for example. Pair items by shape. You can, for example, have a tall, slender plant paired next to two long candlesticks. You can also pair the same types of items. One section of your buffet can contain candles and candle holders while the other can contain antique books you're using as decoration."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Go for a particular color scheme.",
          "description":"You should not have all the items on your buffet match perfectly in terms of color. This can be a bit much and may be overwhelming to look at. However, a general color scheme, especially one that goes with the room, can really help your buffet look well organized. For example, for a room with a warmer color scheme, go for a warm color palate. Stock your buffet with oranges, reds, yellows, and other similar colors. You can also look to other decorations for ideas about color. Maybe you have a painting that uses a lot of gold and yellow colors hung on the wall just to the right of your buffet. Think about using yellow colors to decorate your buffet."

        {
          "headline":"Opt for a less is more approach.",
          "description":"You don't need your buffet to contain every decorative item in your home. In fact, this can easily be overwhelming. Opt for a less is more approach when it comes to decorating your buffet. Challenge yourself to choose only the best items and those that work with your decoration scheme. For example, you may have accrued a lot of figurines over the years. However, you can't put them all on the buffet. Think about which figurines are the nicest and would work best with other decorations. You may, say, be doing a green color scheme. Choose figurines that have some green in them and select the ones you like best. Think about other aspects, like height and shape, to keep the buffet symmetrical as you select the right items."

          "headline":"Add plants.",
          "description":"Plants can be a great addition to a buffet table. If you're unsure how to decorate your buffet, try throwing in a few plants or flowers. This can make the room feel fresher as well, and may add a nice fragrance. If your buffet is near a window, it can be very easy to use a plant or flower to decorate. The plants will be close to a source of natural sunlight. If the buffet or the room smells a little musty, a fragrant flower can freshen things up. If you have pets, like cats, that may eat plants or flowers, you can also try plastic flowers or plants."

        {
          "headline":"Try framed photos.",
          "description":"Many people like to use their buffet to show off photos of friends, family members, and loved ones. If you're unsure how to decorate your buffet, stop by a local print shop and print out some of your favorite photographs. Then, buy some attractive frames to set on your buffet. You can place photos based on things like their height, shape, and type. For example, try keeping things symmetrical by placing frames and photos of similar height and shape on corresponding ends of the buffet. You could also think about grouping photos by type. One area could have family photos, the other could have friends photos, and so on. If you have young children, be careful about breakable objects on your buffet. You may want to remove the glass from photo frames to prevent injury in case children knock them over."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Set up a minibar on your table.",
          "description":"If your buffet is in a room where you frequently have guests, consider a minibar. Bottles of expensive liquor or wine can be assembled near nice glasses and tumblers. If you entertain frequently, refreshments can double as decoration for a striking, attractive buffet. Showcase your nicest bottles and glasses if you use your buffet as a bar. Even if you rarely use the crystal tumblers you got as a wedding gift, they may look nice displayed next to a few attractive bottles of wine. You can also invest in a nice serving tray and placemat. Try placing the tray on the placemat and arranging nice bottles and glasses on the tray. This can be a particularly great option if your buffet has storage below. You can keep spare bottles beneath the buffet and replace them as needed."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Place candles in decorative holders.",
          "description":"You can purchase decorative candle holders at antique shops, craft fairs, and other places. Attractive candles and candle holders can really brighten up a buffet. Candles can be great if you're striving for symmetry, as you can use candles and holders of varying heights to mirror another object. A large plant, for example, can be mirrored with a tall, thin candle and holder. Many people love seasonal candle holders. You can try swapping out candles and candle holders by season. You can, for example, have snowflake decorated candle holders for winter and replace them with pastel colored holders for the spring."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Place decorative knick-knacks on your buffet.",
          "description":"If you have a lot of knick-knacks hanging around, your buffet can be a great place for some of them. Many people receive small decorative items for holidays and birthdays. If you have something like a fancy paperweight or tiny sculpture in storage, try placing on your buffet as decoration. Use discretion when selecting your knick-knacks. You certainly should not put every knick-knack you own on your buffet, as this can make it look crowded. Instead, opt to include your nicest knick-knacks that best match the scheme you're going for. For example, say you're going for a pastel color scheme. You should not display a miniature sculpture painted in bright, primary colors. However, a decorative woodblock painted in a soft shade of purple can be a nice touch."

          "description":"If you have art work that does not have a place, hang it up behind your buffet. If you stocked your buffet with a lot of shorter objects, the wall behind it may need filling. Try hanging up some artwork just behind your buffet. Hang the artwork so it's a little above any items on the buffet. You don't want the artwork to be hidden. Strive to hang a painting at least a few inches above any items on the buffet. Choose art work that matches the color scheme of your room and your buffet. If you're going for a bright primary color scheme, a pastel impressionist painting may not work. However, an abstract painting that uses pastels will match great with your buffet table."

          "headline":"Hang a mirror behind the buffet.",
          "description":"A mirror can be an attractive addition to the wall behind the buffet. It can also help if you want to double the buffet as a vanity area in your home. You can stand before the buffet to do your hair and makeup. As with hanging paintings, try to hang the mirror at least a few inches above any decorations on the buffet. If you want to use the buffet as a vanity, the mirror may look best in the center of the buffet table. This way, things like makeup and hair brushes can be placed on either side of the mirror for your use."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use the space behind the buffet for photographs.",
          "description":"If you don't want to put photos directly on the buffet, you can hang them up on the wall behind it. This can work if you have children or animals that may knock breakable frames off of the buffet table. As you decide where to hang the photos on the wall, strive for balance just like you would with items on the buffet table. Imagine a line going down the wall in the middle of the buffet. Now imagine a mirror image pattern on either side of the line with photographs and pictures, selecting similar sizes and shapes for frames and photos on either side of the wall. The photos don't need to form a perfectly symmetrical pattern, though; balancing sizes and shapes is more important. Make sure any photos you hang up are a few inches above any decorations on the buffet."

This way, people can spend a few minutes filling their plates with food and then congregate around the drink table to socialize. If you don't have a separate buffet table, keep things separate on the table you have. Have drinks on one end, near the napkins and utensils, while keeping food near the other end."

A large metal spoon for serving potatoes works better than a flimsy plastic one, for example. Tongs work great for items like meats and salads.

Provide some space between a turkey and other items. Smaller items that you just grab require less time to serve. Desserts, for example, can usually be easily picked up off the table.
