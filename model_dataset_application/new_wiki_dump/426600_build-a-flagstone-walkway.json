When you see the flagstones you will notice that they are of many sizes and shapes, being a natural material. Select stones enough for the surface area you plan to cover. Avoid those with a very uneven contour on either side. If there is an unbalanced contour on the bottom it can provide a place for the stone to break in half under traffic, and if the irregularity is on the top someone may trip on it. None, however, are smooth as concrete. Consider having them delivered."
