          "headline":"Do squats for at least 1 minute.",
          "description":"Stand up straight with your feet about hip-width apart. Then, bend at your knees to lower your hips and bottom like you're going to sit in a chair. Make sure your knees don\u2019t go out past your toes. Then, push through your heels to rise back to your starting position. Repeat the exercise for at least 1 full minute. You can do your squats for up to 5 minutes, though this might make you feel sore. The longer you do the squats, the more stretched the fabric will be.Variation: You can also do lunges to stretch out the thighs and butt of your jeans, though it's best to do them in addition to squats because they won't stretch your jeans as much."

However, they may still feel tight if the size is too small. If your jeans don\u2019t feel comfortable, you may want to try heating them up for a better stretch."

After you heat the front of your pants, turn them over and heat the backside. You don\u2019t have to heat both sides of your pants, but it will help you stretch them out more."

          "description":"Grip opposite sides of a section with both of your hands, then pull as hard as you can in opposite directions to stretch it. Move your hands up and down the surface of the jeans, pulling the denim in each area you need to stretch. As another option, put your hands inside of the jeans, then use your arm strength to push apart the opposite ends of the waist, hip area, thigh area, or calf area, which should stretch them. As an example, if you are stretching the thighs of your jeans, hold each side of the pant leg in each hand. Then, pull the sides in opposite directions. This will help widen the pant leg. For a bigger waist, it might be easier to unbutton the jeans and place your bent elbows inside the waistband. Then, move your arms apart from each other to stretch the fabric. If the jeans start to cool down before you\u2019re finished stretching them, heat them back up using your hair dryer."

If you\u2019re having trouble buttoning your pants, lie down on your bed and try buttoning them that way. Do squats or lunges for 1-5 minutes to stretch out the denim a little more."

You can also apply more water as necessary while you\u2019re stretching the jeans. If you have liquid fabric softener, add about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of it to your spray bottle before you wet your jeans. This will help soften the denim so it stretches more easily."
