  "text":" Mix and Chill the Dough Place the butter in a mixing bowl and beat it for 3 minutes using either a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or a handheld mixer.  Add the grated marzipan and the sugar to the butter.  Mix the ingredients on low speed until the ingredients are combined. Then, turn the speed up to high and beat the mixture for 5 minutes or until it turns fluffy and almost white. Add the vanilla and mix for 30 seconds on medium speed.  While the mixer is still running, add 1/2 cup of the flour. Mix until the flour is well combined with the wet ingredients. Continue adding the flour in 1/2-cup increments until all of the flour is mixed into the dough.  Form the dough into a disc and wrap it in plastic wrap.  Chill the dough for 15 minutes.  Cut and Bake the Cookies Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C) while you line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and divide the dough into 2 batches.  Return 1 batch to the refrigerator and keep the other out on your countertop.  Roll the half of the dough that you are using out onto a floured work surface, such as a cutting board or a countertop. Make it into a large rectangle that is about 1/4\" thick. Fill a shallow dish with flour. Dip your cookie cutter in the flour and cut shapes in the dough starting in the top left corner. Continue cutting shapes until you have used all of the dough except for the scraps.  Roll the scraps out onto your floured surface.  Cut as many cookies from the scrap dough as you can, and discard the rest.  Place 12 cookies on each baking sheet and bake one sheet of cookies for 6 minutes. Turn the pan 90 degrees and bake again for an additional 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the first pan from the oven and put the second one in, following the baking directions.  Allow the first batch of cookies to cool on the stovetop for 2 minutes before loosening the cookies from the parchment paper with a spatula.  Place the cookies on wire racks to cool.  Repeat the cooling process with the second batch of cookies. ",
