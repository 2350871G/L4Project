This means you will submerge the octopus in a poaching liquid such as water or stock. Poach for about 13 minutes per pound. Let the octopus cool in the poaching liquid. Once cool, remove the skin by rubbing it with a paper towel. It should come away easily. Sear the outside of the skinned octopus in a skillet or grill for about 8 minutes per side. If sliced thin, only sear the octopus for 2 minutes per side."
