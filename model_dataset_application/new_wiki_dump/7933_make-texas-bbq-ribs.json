  "text":" Use a BBQ grill with a lid. The amount of charcoal to use will depend on the number of slabs and the quality of the charcoal. One slab of ribs will require about 2 pounds of charcoal. Place the coal into the grill on the vented side grill at the bottom of the grill. If your grill has more than one vent, close all but the one you have placed the coal to. This will help to keep the coals burning while retaining most of the smoke in the grill. Once the coals are lit and the fire has died down, wait for the coals to be smoky white. Spread the coal out evenly across the bottom of the grill. Put a slab of ribs, rib side down. They should be placed on the side of the grill that is away from the coals. Close the lid for one hour and keep it closed. At the one hour mark open the lid and flip over and rotate the ribs placing them away from the coal. Close the lid and leave closed. Baste the ribs with vinegar and salt, which you mixed earlier. Close the lid again. Time to test. If the ribs are ready when you gently tug or pull on the ribs and the bone comes away from the meat, the ribs are almost done. If done, turn the ribs up and baste with barbecue sauce. Be sure to slather the ribs with BBQ sauce and be sure bone side is up. Close the lid and open all the vents on the grill (careful not to burn your fingers). Cook the ribs for 15 minutes more. Then open the ribs and slather BBQ sauce on the other side, and leave on the grill for 15 minutes more with the lid closed. You will have to watch the ribs for at this stage they may burn. The ribs will brown up quickly after you put the   sauce on. Do not close the lid. Now is a good time to have a cold drink. Boy them there ribs smell mighty good. What do you think? As the ribs cook they will get a little charred. It's time to remove them from the grill. Once again load on the BBQ sauce, place the ribs in tin foil and tightly wrap. Place the foil and ribs back on the grill. Let the ribs cook for 30 minutes or so. Finished. ",
