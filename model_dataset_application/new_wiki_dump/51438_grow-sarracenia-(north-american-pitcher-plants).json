Perlite is an excellent substitute for sand if you can not find any. Peat moss that includes fertilizer can kill your Sarracenia plants, so be very careful which brand you choose! Horticultural or aquatic sands work well - do not use play sand! Again, silica sand is the safest bet."

Try the following rinsing method:\nPlace peat moss in a bucket and cover with tap water. Stir with your hand, then squeeze to wring out water. Transfer to second bucket and repeat two or three times with distilled water or rainwater. Place sand in a bucket or tray outdoors, to avoid clogging plumbing.

Most pitcher plants will even have trouble growing under artificial lights or on a sunny windowsill. Keep them in an outdoor location that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. Try the south side of your house if you're in the Northern Hemisphere, or the north side if you're in the Southern Hemisphere. Sarracenia Purpurea, Rosea, Psittacina, and some of their hybrids can grow decently well on a sunny windowsill or in a terrarium; however, make sure you know the dormancy needs.full sun.

For best results, use collected rainwater, reverse osmosis water or distilled water. Avoid \"spring water,\" which may contain harmful additives. If you have a water testing kit, check that your water contains fewer than 100ppm minerals, and no chlorine or heavy metals. If your tap water meets these standards, it might be safe. Reduce risk by rinsing the watering tray periodically."

Try burying just four grains of balanced (14-14-14) slow-release fertilizer \u00bd cm (0.2 inches) beneath the surface, at the start of the growing season. Or you can get something such as seaweed fertilizer (like Maxsea 16-16-16) and dilute it 1/4 tsp per gallon and put it inside the pitchers... All the way up to the top!"

About one worm per trap per month should be enough, but this may vary based on size and species. Bloodworms can also be used. Outdoor pitcher plants, especially upright pitchers, may even find too much food, and topple over from the weight of the insects! If this starts to happen, stick a cotton ball in the mouth of the pitcher until it's had time to digest."

This is triggered by colder temperatures and shorter days. It usually lasts at least 3 months. Indoor plants may not go dormant on their own.

For upright species, including flava and alata, trim the traps right down to the rhizome, so the rhizome can photosynthesize. For best results, look up your individual species or hybrid to check for different pruning requirements. Some species have traps that can last up to two years, including psittacina, purperea, rosea, and some of their hybrids. There may be a second die-off in late summer, which also requires trimming."

Consider bringing them indoors if temperature drops below -6.7\u00baC (+20\u00baF), or during an early or late frost. Species native to Florida or Gulf of Mexico, including psittacina and rosea, should be taken indoors if the temperature drops below freezing. Plants can withstand low temperatures more effectively if protected from wind and kept near the house, rather than on an exposed deck or open area. Keep indoor plants dormant by storing them in an unheated garage or shed, with temperatures below 13\u00baC (55\u00baF)."
