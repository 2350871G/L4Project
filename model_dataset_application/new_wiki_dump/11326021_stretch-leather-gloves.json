Keep in mind that the hose water will probably be cold, or below 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C). If you don\u2019t have access to a hose, consider using a running faucet instead. If you\u2019re trying to stretch antique gloves, treat them with leather conditioner instead of water."

If you\u2019re having some difficulty, try forming a fist with both hands over the finger portion of the gloves. Continue this process until the material is damp, but not wet. Be sure to do this outside or over a sink."

Even if your hands feel damp and a little gross, wait several hours until the leather dries completely. At this point, check to see how the leather fits around your fingers and palms. If the gloves are still tight, try soaking and wearing the gloves again. You can also try stuffing them with damp newspaper.

Once the gloves are no longer damp, remove the newspaper pieces and try them on. Avoid using a blow dryer to speed up the process, as this can damage the leather. Don\u2019t keep the newspaper in the gloves for more than 2-3 days. Since the newspaper will still be damp, it will eventually get moldy. If the gloves still don\u2019t fit properly, try moistening and restuffing them with newspaper. You can also try soaking the material with water and wearing the gloves, or treating the leather with rubbing alcohol or leather conditioner. Once the gloves dry, consider treating them with leather conditioner to keep the material in great condition."

Before you put your gloves back on, read the instructions for your leather conditioner and see if the product needs time to soak into the leather. This will make the gloves softer, which will make the material more flexible to the shape of your hand. If you don\u2019t have leather conditioner on hand, try using saddle soap instead."
