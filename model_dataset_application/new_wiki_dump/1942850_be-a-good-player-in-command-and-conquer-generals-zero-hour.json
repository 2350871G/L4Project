Don't ever keep the units in-line. It's always better to make them in layers, with the strongest deterrent in front. Once you're done (this should take approximately seven minutes), you can rest assured that your base can last long enough (in a worst case scenario) for you to make a counter attack. In most cases, you'll be able to defend even a horde of Overlords, if you've laid out the defense units properly. Also, build patriots/rocket sites/bunker with missile+gun units beside every building. This might just provide you with that extra 30 seconds you need."

Once you're inside their defense, send infantry and tankettes ahead of you to keep the enemy engaged, whilst you call in back-up airstrike/light armored attack units. Decimate your opponent."
