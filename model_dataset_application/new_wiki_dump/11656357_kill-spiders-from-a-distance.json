Turn the machine on and place the end of the attachment over the spider. Take a moment to vacuum any lingering web, too. The force of the suction should kill any spider you vacuum, but to be safe empty the vacuum canister in an outside bin. If the idea of doing so makes you squeamish, ask a friend to help."

Spray the spider repeatedly until it stops moving. The acid in the vinegar will burn and kill the spider. Once the spider is dead, use a vacuum or dustpan and brush to sweep it up and throw it out. Wipe down the wall or area with a damp cloth to clean away the vinegar."

If the spider falls before you manage to smash it, you may have to smack it a few times with the broom to kill it. This method might be a little more panic-inducing because there is a chance you\u2019ll simply knock the spider down but not kill it right away."

Check the traps every few days and throw them out once they\u2019ve caught the spider or spiders. If you have children or pets, place the traps somewhere they won\u2019t come into contact with them as the glue on some of them can be toxic."

Catching it under a cup and taking it outside is a humane option if you can bring yourself to do it.Warning: If you suspect that the spider is a brown recluse or black widow, do not attempt to catch and release it. Kill it with an insecticide made specifically for spiders. If you suspect an infestation, contact a professional exterminator to deal with them."

Similarly, clean up fallen leaves and foliage around the perimeter of your home. Spiders normally get into the home through cracks and crevices. Keeping the perimeter clean provides less incentive for them to find those cracks.Tip: Always wear sturdy work gloves while clearing out leaves and yard waste. If there are any spiders in there, the gloves should protect you from any potential bites."

          "description":"Spiders are attracted to light, especially at nighttime. They like to spin their webs in front of light sources so it\u2019s easier for them to catch bugs that fly toward the light. Even just remembering to turn off outside lights when the sun starts to go down can help reduce the number of spiders on the outside of your home, making it less likely that they\u2019ll find their way indoors. Use yellow or sodium vapor lights as an alternative to normal lightbulbs. They attract fewer bugs."

Focus the spray on areas where spiders are most likely to hang around, like windows and the corners of rooms. Most sprays will also break down any current webs in or outside your home, making them easier to clean up."

It also repels cockroaches, mosquitos, fleas, and flies, plus it is usually a pleasing smell to humans. You can buy fresh eucalyptus online or from local garden centers. You could even grow an herb garden outside your home or in a planter outside a window to repel spiders."
