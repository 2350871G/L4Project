          "description":"The process of making creamed honey involves adding seed honey to liquid honey. Seed honey has already crystallized, so it promotes more crystallization in fresh liquid honey. One of the seed types you can use is honey that\u2019s already been creamed. Creamed honey can be purchased in many grocery stores, health food stores, at farmers markets, and at bee farms. Creamed honey will sometimes be labeled whipped, spun, or set honey."

          "description":"Another seed you can use to make creamed honey is the hardened sugar crystals from previously liquid honey. Unprocessed honey naturally crystallizes over time, and you can collect this hardened honey and powder it to use as seed honey. Collect the crystallized honey from an old jar of honey. Place the crystals in a blender or food processor and grind the crystals into a fine powder. This breaks down the large crystals, and these will seed the growth of more small crystals in your new batch of creamed honey. You can also grind the crystallized honey using a pestle and mortar."

Take the lid off the jar of honey. Place the jar in the fridge. Reduce the temperature of the fridge to 58 F (14 C) or lower. Over the next few days, the sugar in the honey will gradually crystalize. Collect the hardened crystals once you have enough for a seed to make your creamed honey. Process the crystallized honey in a blender, food processor, or with a pestle and mortar to turn it into a fine powder."

If large crystals form rather than small ones, the honey will harden instead of becoming smooth and spreadable.
