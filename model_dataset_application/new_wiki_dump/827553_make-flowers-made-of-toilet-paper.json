Line up your toilet paper squares and pinch them in the middle, creating a bow-like shape. Take your pipe cleaner and wrap it twice tightly around the middle of the toilet paper.

Pull the layers of toilet paper apart and rearrange them creatively to form your flower petals. You can gather, bunch, pull, or even cut these petals to give them the shape you want. While you want to see how far you can stretch your flower petals, be sure to do so carefully. Toilet paper is prone to rip if you pull it with force."

This will take anywhere from 5-30 minutes, depending on how heavily you dipped your flowers. Because you\u2019ve used toilet paper, it will soak up the dye very, very quickly. Remember this when dipping the tips of the petals. You barely need to touch the dye to add a lot of color quickly to your petals."

To do this, simply roll the outside tips gently through the dye and then dip the taller petals into your second color."
