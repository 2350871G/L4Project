Wash the rice under fresh running water for a minute. Soaking and washing rice removes dirt and excess starch, so your rice will be fluffy and not sticky."

          "description":"Pour 2 cups (470 ml) or water into a medium saucepan. Put on a lid and bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Depending on the type of rice you're making, you may need to adjust the rice to water ratio. Per cup of rice (195 g), use the following water quantities:\nUse 2 cups (470 ml) of water for long-grain white rice, medium- or short-grain brown rice, and wild rice. Use 1\u00be cups of water (411 ml) for long-grain brown rice or jasmine rice. Use 1\u00bd cups of water (353 ml) for medium-grain white rice or basmati rice. Use 1\u00bc cups of water (294 ml) for short-grain white rice."

Once the water is simmering again, put the lid on and turn the heat down to low. Continue cooking for 18 to 30 minutes, depending on the type of rice. White rice varieties will take around 18 minutes to cook. Brown rice varieties will need closer to 30 minutes. Don\u2019t stir the rice or remove the lid until it\u2019s time to check for doneness.

This will help to steam the rice, give it a chance to absorb leftover moisture, and make it tender. You can leave the rice to steam for up to 30 minutes."
