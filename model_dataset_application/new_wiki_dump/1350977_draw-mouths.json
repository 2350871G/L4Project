          "description":"This is the line where the bottom of the upper lip meets the top of the lower lip. The shape of this line is a little different on everyone, and it depends on what facial expression is being made. Generally, for a resting facial expression, this line has a slight upward curve on each side and a dip in the middle. Make the dip about the same length as the upward curving lines on the ends. Make the length of this line as wide as you want the lips to be."

          "description":"Start at the left end of the first line you drew, then draw a line at an upward angle, about 10-20\u00b0, to the right. Stop when you\u2019re above a little less than the halfway point on the first line you drew. Repeat on the right end of the first line you drew, this time drawing the angled line to the left. Finally, draw a shallow \u201cU\u201d shape between the ends of the angled lines. This will be the dip in the top of the upper lip.Tip: Everyone\u2019s lips are different. This is a good place to start when you\u2019re learning, but you can always adjust the upper lip as needed. The dip could be wider or narrower, and the angled lines could curve up or down. If you\u2019re drawing from a reference photo or model, use this as a guide, but try to capture the unique shape of their upper lip."

Generally, the lower lip is bigger than the upper lip (about 1 \u00bd times bigger). You can make the lower lip even bigger, or have it be the same size as the upper lip. To make the bottom lip bigger, make the \u201cU\u201d shaped line deeper. To make it smaller, make the \u201cU\u201d shaped line shallower."

          "description":"If you look at someone\u2019s lips, you\u2019ll notice they\u2019re not perfectly smooth. Lips have fine, vertical creases in them, which get more pronounced as people age. These lines will be more noticeable in the lower lip, so start there. Draw a series of around 10 lines that span across the lower lip. Repeat on the top lip, but draw fewer lines and make them shorter since they\u2019re usually less noticeable there. Vary the length of each line, and curve them slightly so the lines on the left half of the lips curve out to the left and the lines on the right half curve out to the right. Make the lines near the center of the lips relatively straight."

          "description":"The right way to shade the lips will depend on the lighting. If the lighting is above the face, the shadows would fall at the bottom of each lip, so shade those areas the darkest. If the light is coming from the side of the face, one half of the lips would be darker (the half that\u2019s opposite the lighting) than the other half. For straight-on lighting, there wouldn\u2019t be very many shadows. In that case, the darkest part of the lips would be where the upper and lower lips meet. Generally, the brightest areas will be the portions of the lips that stick out the most, like the middle of the lower lip and the top of the upper lip. Leave these areas white. Shading will add highlights and shadows to the lips, making them look more realistic."

Start by drawing a horizontal line with a shallow upward curve. Make this line as long as you want the width of the mouth to be. This will be the bottom of the upper lip. Next, starting at one end of that line, draw a \u201cU\u201d shaped line that ends at the opposite end you started at.

At this point, the mouth will have a banana-like shape. Sketch the top of the upper lip. Start at one end of the curved horizontal line, and draw a shallow downward-curving line that ends slightly above the halfway point on the curved horizontal line.

Shade in the gums and mouth. Shading will give your drawing dimension and make it look more real.
