Swap out your open feeders with covered feeders so birds are less likely to rely on your barn for food. Covered feeders work like regular troughs, but they have a roof over them.

Birds can\u2019t get comfortable on them, so they fly away. Electric perch repellents. Electric perch repellents are cables that will give birds a minor shock when they land on them.

The rods can't be pushed outward from the inside, so the birds aren't able to escape. A funnel trap is another option. A funnel trap has a funnel-shaped opening that birds can easily enter.
