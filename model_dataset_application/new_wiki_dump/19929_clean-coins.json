          "description":"Doing this will allow your faucet to remove initial dirt buildup. The faucet should have enough water pressure to get the job done, so avoid any add-on to increase the pressure, like a jet. You only need to hold a coin under the faucet for about one minute on each side. Once you are done place them aside on a paper towel or rag. All coins can be cleaned with water. However, copper coins react to more things than nickel or silver, and will therefore usually exhibit more environmental damage. This makes them harder to clean with just water. Make sure to plug the drain before cleaning coins in your sink to avoid a coin from slipping out of your hands and into the drain. Handle each coin separately so the faucet can hit each coin directly."

          "description":"Create a solution in a small bowl mixing water from your faucet and dish soap and dip each coin in the bath individually. Put the coin between your index finger and your thumb and softly rub dirt from the face of the coin. You should see the dirt begin to come off. If you have a particularly dirty coin, you can allow it to soak in the solution. A non-abrasive liquid solvent like distilled water and a weak soap will have enough cleaning power to clean your coins, and does not contain acids that can corrode them."

Rinse the coin often to avoid any visible scratches left over from loosened dirt. Doing this to valuable or antique coins can cause tiny scratches that reduce the value of the coin. When you are done scrubbing, make sure you do a final rinse of the coin. Make sure to not rub the coin too hard. Concentrate on a small area and brush lightly."

Your coins should now be shiny and have a good lustre. Using a cotton free cloth won\u2019t leave a residue. Patting the coins will allow you to avoid creating micro-scratches with the material you are wiping it with."

To make your coin bath combine a cup of over-the-counter isopropyl alcohol and two tablespoons of table salt in a bowl. Mix the solution and place your coins in it. Let your coins soak for anywhere from two hours to a week, depending on how dirty your coins are.

Coins can be damaged by extreme heat or cold, so it\u2019s good to keep them in a room temperature area with low humidity. Don\u2019t store your coins in a place where they can fall over, like a high, unsturdy shelf.

Cleaning collectable coins can significantly reduce their value, and in fact, sometimes coin \u201ctoning\u201d or the discoloration and patina caused by exposure to air can actually add to the coin\u2019s overall value. For that reason, you shouldn\u2019t be cleaning valuable or antique coins. When you are handling antique coins, always hold them on the edge and not on the coin's face. Oils and fingerprints can hurt a coin's value. There is standardised grading for coins, so even the smallest scratch from wiping one off can significantly reduce its value."

You can use a q-tip or a very soft non-synthetic brush to apply the Vaseline. Do not put too much Vaseline on the coin. The trick is to put on the thinnest layer possible."

It's imperative that you immediately rinse your coins with distilled water and get all of the acetone off the coin before allowing it to air dry. Do not wipe or rub your antique coins. Because acetone is a solvent and not an acid, it will not affect the value of your coins unless they are exposed to it for a prolonged period. Acetone is flammable. Wear powder-free gloves if you decide to use this chemical. If you are using a jar of distilled water, line the bottom with a napkin so that your coins don't get scratched by hitting against the inside of the jar. Use 100% acetone. Other products that contain acetone will also contain other chemicals that can destroy the value of your coin."

Hard plastic is better because it is more sturdy and will prevent your coin from being damaged. The most important thing is that the containers are air-tight and that the coins will not be exposed to the environment around it. Make sure that you remove any plastic that contains PVC plastic. Buy coin flips that use Mylar flips because PVC can damage the coins over time. Keep your antique coins away from staples or other metal. Do not use paper. It contains sulphur and can turn your coins black."
