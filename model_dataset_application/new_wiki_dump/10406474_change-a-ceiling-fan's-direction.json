This can further help to save money on running the air conditioning, and potentially cut your summer electricity bill in half. The downward breeze caused by running your fan counterclockwise helps to evaporate the moisture off your skin during hot weather. You can keep yourself cool without an air conditioner this way."

          "description":"When it's cold, warm air rises to the ceiling and stays there unless you use a fan to disperse it around. Running your fan clockwise will direct the breeze upward instead, spreading the heat more evenly around the room. Having high vaulted ceilings, or a fireplace or stove in the room with the fan makes this particularly effective."

          "description":"Most fans will have 5 blades, but those with 3 or 4 will actually help to create more movement of air around the space. It will be the case for either direction you can run the fan, helping to better cool down or warm up a room. As long as you let the same amount of power reach the new fan, it should work just as well as any 5-bladed fan. If your new fan has a smaller motor, though, it may now work as efficiently even with fewer blades. Keep in mind that more airflow generates more noise."

Get a friend to help hold the ladder steady to keep you safe as you climb. Always follow ladder safety. Make sure all its feet are flat on the ground before you climb on it, secure on a surface where they won't slip. Don't climb to the highest point on the ladder."

If your fan doesn't have a switch on the motor, the direction reverse may be handled in a different way, such as a button on the fan's remote control. Other models might have a hanging chain that will have to be pulled to change the fan's direction, saving you the hassle of needing a ladder."
