          "description":"Select a location like a garage or large shed. Open a door or window if you can. Good ventilation is important because, during the charging process, a mixture of gases builds up in your battery, and if the battery is overcharged or shorts out, these gases may vent out of the battery. If the battery is somewhere with poor ventilation, this may lead to an explosion. The ventilation in most enclosures should be sufficient to minimize this risk. The ventilation in a small, enclosed shed, crawlspace, or other small room, however, may not be enough."

          "headline":"Take proper precautions whenever handling a lead acid battery.",
          "description":"Wear protective eye glasses and gloves to protect yourself from any acid that may leak from the battery. Keep flammable materials and items that may produce a spark (like electronics) away from the battery. And keep the battery at least 18 inches (46 cm) above the floor. Never smoke anywhere near a lead acid battery. Do not try to charge a battery that is frozen, damaged, or leaking. If battery acid splashes into your eyes or skin, flush the affected area with lukewarm running water for at least 30 continuous minutes and seek immediate medical attention. Keep baking soda nearby. If battery acid splashes on any surface, cover the spill area with baking soda to neutralize the acid. Rinse off your gloves thoroughly after handling a lead acid battery, and then, use soap and water to wash yourself."

          "headline":"Use a smart lead acid battery charger to charge your battery.",
          "description":"Lead acid batteries need to be charged in various stages and voltages. This can be difficult to do, so the best way to charge your battery is to use a smart charger that automates the multi-stage process. These smart chargers have microprocessors that monitor the battery and adjust the current and voltage as required for an optimal charge. Using a multi-stage smart charger will reduce the risk of overcharging or undercharging your battery. You can purchase a lead acid battery charger at most large home improvement stores. Buy a charger with a desulfation mode to maintain the performance of your battery. This mode will breakdown the lead sulfate crystals in your battery. Follow the directions in the owner\u2019s manual that came with your specific battery to use this mode."

Squeeze the clamp and position the teeth of the clamp securely on the post on the battery. Keep the battery charger disconnected from the power source for this step. Position the charger as far away from the battery as the cables will allow, just in case the charger malfunctions and sparks. Place the charger to the side of the battery at the same height level, not above or below it."

A ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet controls the amount of power that goes to a device that is plugged in, and will cut power if it detects a power imbalance that may cause an electrical shock.
