They are the number one giveaways when you are hiding. Be sure to look for disturbed objects in the environment, this means that someone was here and has moved on to a different spot. For example, you might see a basket of clothes tipped over next to a \"mannequin\" that's covered in clothes. However, be aware that if the hider is an expert, they'll probably tip over stuff on purpose to distract you. Be aware  that most players will always move to different hiding spots, making it much trickier for you to find them. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/98\\/Be-a-Professional-Hide-and-Seek-Player-Step-5.jpg\\/v4-460px-Be-a-Professional-Hide-and-Seek-Player-Step-5.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/98\\/Be-a-Professional-Hide-and-Seek-Player-Step-5.jpg\\/v4-760px-Be-a-Professional-Hide-and-Seek-Player-Step-5.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
