      "headline":"Purchase rue seeds or seedlings.",
      "description":"If using seeds, plant them in small seed-raising trays or punnets using seed-raising mix. During germination, keep the soil moist and in a warm, bright but shady position. Increase the sun exposure gradually prior to planting in the garden. If you prefer to use cuttings, take these towards the end of summer. Avoid woody growth; look for mature green growth and take cuttings of about 10 centimeter (4 in) in length. Place in sandy soil to strike, keeping the soil moist. As with the seeds, bright shade is the best positioning while the roots develop. Rooted layers can be dug up and replanted. You'll see roots developing where stems touch the ground."

      "description":"Rue grows best in cool and warm climates, but it doesn't like humidity during summer. If you're in a cool climate, ensure that it has a position with full sun. In a warmer climate, a little shade is fine but not too much."

    {
      "headline":"Prepare the soil.",
      "description":"Rue likes poor soil but it must be well drained and deep. Sandy or gravelled soils are the best choices. If the soil is too rich for the rue, its growth will be excessive."

      "headline":"Water deeply.",
      "description":"A deep watering every two weeks is best from mid-autumn to mid-spring. During summer, water only if it gets very dry; let rain do most of the watering. Don't fertilise. Rue doesn't need it."
