      "description":"Regardless of what town map you have, the train station is located near the top of the map, just left of the exit that takes you to Main Street. Once you\u2019re inside the train station, speak with the monkey (use the \u201cA\u201d button to initiate dialogue with characters). You\u2019ll see that you have two options: either to visit a nearby town or a faraway town."

    {
      "headline":"Have your best friend close so you can visit their nearby town.",
      "description":"If you and your friend are close to each other, have one of you go to visit the other's town; it doesn't matter who. Just make sure your gate is open so they can come in! If you choose to visit a nearby town, Porter (the monkey at the station) will simply look for nearby random players who have their gates open to other nearby players. This option works even if you haven\u2019t previously exchanged friend codes with that player. This can work if you\u2019re sitting next to your desired best friend and they open up their gate for you. However, do be aware that if you or your friend opens your town gates to nearby players, that you might end up with other unintended visitors. If you are worried that might happen, close the gate when all your intended friends have arrived without sending them back."

    {
      "headline":"Choose a faraway town with an established friend who isn't nearby.",
      "description":"If your best friend isn't nearby and you choose to visit a faraway town, your 3DS will connect through the Internet to towns with people whom you\u2019ve already exchanged friend codes with and who have their gates open to far away players. Remember, this option only works if you've already exchanged friend codes. Otherwise, their faraway town won't show up. You don't need to be friends on the game do this to work, as long as you are friends on your DS."

      "headline":"Add them as your friend by tapping their name on the town list.",
      "description":"Once you\u2019re in your desired best friend\u2019s town, simply look for the green button that has icons of people on it on the bottom left of the touch screen. Tapping that button will result in list of every person in the current town. Most likely, it will only comprise of your desired best friend, but if others are wandering around, they\u2019ll show up, too. Tap the name of the person you desire to be best friends with and they will be added to your Animal Crossing friend list."

      "headline":"Go from friends to best friends by tapping the heart by their name.",

In order to become best friends, you just have to have this person add you back by tapping the heart next to your name. If you have your friend visit your town, have them add you to their list. Then you can look at your list and make them your best friend by tapping the heart next to his or her name."
