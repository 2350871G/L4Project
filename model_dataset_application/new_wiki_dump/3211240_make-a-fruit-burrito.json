On a tortilla, put some of the cheese mix and spread it around.  For the filling, either mix the chopped fruits and place the mixture on the cheese or place the fruits separately for a different fruit taste as you go down the burrito.  On the fruits, drizzle some mayo and a little generous amount of chocolate sauce. Sprinkle a small amount of cilantro to get the perfect herb and fruit flavor combination Sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon powder. Sprinkle a little cheese on the cilantro and roll the burrito in the standard way. Now Heat the burrito on both the sides to heat and cook the cheese and to allow all the flavors to mix properly. Make as many burritos possible using the entire mixture using the same steps.  Making the Sauce Roughly chop the strawberries and put them in a pan with the flame set on low-medium.
