Go for a swim, walks, check out the rock pools and count boats. Organise a family game. Get the family out to play a game together outdoors. You might like to play racing games, ball games or hide and seek style games. You could also play team sports, such as rounders, soccer, tennis, etc. Do some gardening together. Focus on planting lovely things or harvesting rather than weeding\u2013\u2013keep it fun. If you don't have a garden of your own, visit a local community garden and help out for a few hours. Or, you can make a mini garden on an old small plate or in a flask top or on a suitable stone. Place it in a sunny part of the garden. Go cycling together. Have everyone pump up the tires of their bikes, grab their helmets and head off to a safe and enjoyable local ride together. Get out the paddling pool. Turn on the hose and have water fun. If you live where there are water restrictions, this might not be an option; check first. Find free outdoor movies. These are often held during summer by libraries, botanical gardens or art groups."

Some examples of things you might like to do include:\nGo hiking in a local park, woods or even back country if it's close enough. Get up early if you have to travel an hour or two. Sit under a tree and enjoy its shade. Bring a picnic lunch, some music and a book. You can make daisy chains while sitting on the grass. Go to the beach. Surf, swim, take a boat or sit on the sand and make sandcastles. Go to a park or wildlife reserve. Do some birdwatching or animal observing. Make notes, take photographs and see if you can identify the different birds or animals that you're observing. Take your dogs for a walk."
