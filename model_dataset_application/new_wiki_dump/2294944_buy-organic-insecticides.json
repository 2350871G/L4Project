Inspect your plants closely, paying attention to the physical characteristics of any insects you happen to spot. You can then run an internet search or consult a horticulture specialist to get more information about what they are and how to get rid of them. Aphids, caterpillars, cutworms and various beetles are among the most destructive pests commonly found in gardens. A guidebook with detailed photographs may come in handy for researching common insect species."

One or two bugs isn\u2019t a cause for alarm, but a full-fledged infestation will need to be dealt with immediately. Determining how serious the situation is will also help give you an idea of how much and what kind of insecticide you'll need. If you only spot a few bugs, you may be able to simply brush them off by hand or blast them away using a garden hose. Don't forget to check the backs of the stalks and the undersides of the leaves, as well. Insects can often be found hiding in shady, out-of-the-way places."

You\u2019ll usually be able to find out what sorts of plants a product is designed to treat by reading the label.
