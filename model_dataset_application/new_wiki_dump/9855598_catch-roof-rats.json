Roof rats are excellent climbers and can squeeze through very small spaces. If you can\u2019t find anything from the inside, use a ladder to access the roof from the outside. From that perspective, you might be able to see gaps in your roofing or small holes that the rats are squeezing through. Keep track of the hole locations by taking pictures and marking them with bright chalk so that you remember where to patch later."

Purchase a material like steel flashing, and use bolts to secure the metal over the holes or gaps that you found. Make sure that your bolts are tight and secure around the plates to prevent them from coming loose over time."

Once you have the metal plate bolted in place, use caulking applied around the outer edge to stop air and light from entering through tiny cracks. Caulking is used to seal windows, so it will hold up against varying temperatures as well as moisture and wind. Be sure that all holes are blocked and sealed before and after setting any traps."

To entice rats, you can place bait on the board like you would for a snap trap. Be sure to check glue boards every day, as they will need to be replaced more often than snap traps. Sometimes, rats can break free from glue boards by wiggling, or even gnawing off their own limbs. If you notice this is becoming a problem, switch to snap traps."
