If they don\u2019t appear to be blocked, you may need to change out the compost mix because it can decay and become soggy and waterlogged over time. Also check your planter after rain. If water seems to accumulate and puddle in your planter after rain, remove any blockage from the drainage holes underneath."

          "description":"For climates that experience occasional frosts in winter, wrap your planter, with perennials inside if you\u2019re leaving them in there during winter, with bubble wrap during frost. This will protect the planter from cracking and the compost mix from freezing. You can remove the bubble wrap during the day and on warmer nights. This is especially wise to do if you are leaving perennials inside the planter, so they don\u2019t become too hot from the sun inside the bubble wrap. Bury small planters directly in the ground with the plant inside. Make sure that the top of the pot is level with the ground. This will minimize the freeze-thaw cycle and better maintain temperature for the plant."

          "description":"If your area gets extremely cold or the ground remains frozen for most of the winter, the best thing to do is bring your planters inside. Planters can crack in extreme cold. If you don\u2019t have room for your planters inside, you should still dump the compost from them and wrap them in a plastic tarp or bubble wrap for protection. The exception to this are certain planters designed to withstand cold. Metal, wood, fiberglass, and certain plastics can survive cold temperatures. If you have evergreens, for instance, you can keep your plant outside in a weather-resistant planter. Always bring clay pots inside in below freezing temperatures, as they will crack. Check to see if your plants need a period of dormancy in the winter to help them grow in the spring. If they don't, they may survive well indoors. If they do, they may not do so well inside."

Wrap metal planters in plastic tarps, or bring them inside, during the winter to prevent rust from snow. If you notice rust on your planter, address it right away to prevent it from spreading. Scrub the rust with a wire brush and wipe it away. Spray a rust sealant over this area to help prevent the rust from returning."

Allowing your planter to sit in water can damage all types of planter materials. Create feet for your planter with bricks or rocks to keep the bottom off the ground.

Empty any plants from your planter by carefully tipping the planter and taking the plants and roots out. Temporarily place each plant in another pot with soil. Clean clay planters by scrubbing them with a steel wool brush and white vinegar, then soak them in a solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water for 30 minutes. Rinse and dry them before you replant your plants. Plastic planters can be cleaned with a cloth and warm soapy water."

Different plants, planters, and seasons come with different water requirements, so always check the moisture level on the top of your potting mix before watering. If your top layer of soil is damp, your planter doesn\u2019t need water right then. If it\u2019s dry, then it\u2019s time to water your plants."

Check the top layer of potting mix for dryness twice a day on really hot days. If the mix is dry, it\u2019s time to water. Plants in black planters tend to dry out the fastest, and clay planters dry out faster than plastic, so be extra cautious when checking on those. Do not place dark-colored planters in sunny areas, as they may heat up and dry out more quickly."

Then give it another watering to make sure the water really soaked into the roots. Any unneeded water will drain out the second time if you have good planter drainage. If your planter doesn\u2019t drain after the first watering, it is probably way too dry. Be sure to check it more frequently for dryness, especially during the summer."

A way to prevent these diseases from forming is by not overhead watering your plants; in other words, water them below the foliage near the potting mix at the base of the plant. Black spot looks just like how it sounds: brown or black spots on leaves that cause leaves to yellow and fall off. It\u2019s most common in moist, humid climates. Remove any affected leaves, destroy them or throw them in the trash, and clean up plant debris at the planter bottom. Botrytis blight, or grey mold, is a fungus that can affect plants during cool, rainy weather. The treatment for it is the same as black spot. Powdery mildew looks like a dusting of powder all over your plant\u2019s leaves. It tends to happen when days are warm and nights are cool. You can treat and prevent it by spraying your plants with neem oil and reducing how much they receive. Try not to overcrowd plants, as crowded plants are at higher risk of developing powdery mildew."

Get a new planter, fill it with new mix, and transfer about half of your plants into the new container. Spread out the plants in your first planter, and add new compost to the top layer."

If your plants start yellowing, browning, dropping leaves, or you notice soggy compost at the top of the planter, you may have overpotted and therefore the plant cannot drink all the water you\u2019re giving it in a proper amount of time. Replant your plant in a smaller planter by tipping the large pot gently and allowing loose compost to fall away. Put the plant into a container that\u2019s just a bit bigger than the root ball of your plant, and fill this container with new mix. Water the plant sparingly until it starts to recover."
