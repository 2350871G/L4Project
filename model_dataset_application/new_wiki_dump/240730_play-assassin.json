If you want to start a \u201cguild\u201d at your school or camp, put up posters with your contact information on it. As players sign up, add them to a roster by writing their names and contact information down. Groups that play Assassin together are commonly called a \u201cguild\u201d or \u201csociety.\u201d They often function like unsanctioned clubs where students can simply sign up on a social media page or dedicated website."

You can also opt to have a group of players serve as the game runners if you\u2019re playing a bigger game. Keep it to an odd number though so you don\u2019t end up with ties if you have to vote on a contested game action. The person in charge of a game is called the director, and individual players are often named agents. Feel free to come up with your own terms though."

Ask each player to come up with a codename or nickname that they will use for the duration of the game. Players use their codename or nickname to create a character that they will play throughout the duration of the game.Tip: Encourage players to get into character. If a player wants to use a plastic sword and be a ninja, let them! If the players have fun playing roles, they\u2019ll be more dedicated to the game. Examples of good nicknames for Assassin include \u201cThe Nightingale,\u201d \u201cMr. Green,\u201d and \u201cBlack Shadow.\u201d Any name that seems like it would work in a spy movie will work well. Players can put their nicknames on a sticker or clothespin to signal that they\u2019re actively playing, or they can use some kind of prop to signify that they\u2019re in character."

Rubber bands, Nerf guns, fake swords, and spray bottles filled with water can all be used as weapons. For a player to assassinate someone, all they have to do is touch the opposing player with their weapon or projectile. Remember, the aim isn\u2019t to hurt anyone! A simple tap is all that\u2019s required to knock someone out. {Warning: While Nerf guns are the most common choice, be extremely careful if you\u2019re allowing these weapons. Players have been arrested before for carrying realistic-looking Nerf weapons around and referencing their \u201cgun\u201d on school campuses. Players can all agree to use the same type of weapon, or select different weapons unique to each player\u2019s individual character. Players shouldn\u2019t be whacking each other with their weapons. The goal is to be sneaky anyway, so they shouldn\u2019t need to use any brute force. Disqualifying players for hitting opponents is a common rule in most games of Assassin. If players want to use spray bottles or water balloons, make sure that all players agree to the possibility of getting wet in the game."

The bigger the play area, the longer the game is going to take to complete. Make the area bigger if you\u2019ve got a large set of players looking to play a longer game. Stick with a single block, street, house, or park if you\u2019re playing with a handful of others. If you\u2019re playing on a college campus, the game is usually restricted to the campus or a specific dorm. If you\u2019re in high school, the school itself is usually the play area.

You can have it last as needed to have 1 player standing at the end, or you can set a deadline for the game to end. Deadlines are great because they increase tension and encourage involvement, but every player may not have the time or energy to execute their plan before the buzzer runs out. For deadlines, 1-2 days is a common choice if you have fewer than 20 players. Bigger games can last weeks though! The downside to an untimed game is that players who are knocked out early won\u2019t be involved for a larger period of time. This may make them unlikely to rejoin for the next game."

If the director is assigning targets, have the director assign a new target to the player that successfully kills their opponent. Players can have multiple targets, or a single specific target. The most common way to play is to give every player a different target. When a player is killed, the successful is assassin is assigned to hunt the knocked out player\u2019s target."

If you\u2019re playing in a neighborhood, select a neutral location, like a park or fast food restaurant, to serve as the safe zone. At school, keep classrooms off-limits.

Instead of touching an opposing player with your weapon, the goal is to remove the other player\u2019s clothespin without them noticing. Requiring players to put the clothespin on their back is a common rule. Colored stickers are a good alternative to clothespins. You can use color-coded stickers to create teams for another variation on the game. At the end of the game, players simply reveal how many clothespins they\u2019ve captured to determine who the winner is. You can play a variation where any player that assassinates another player is awarded their clothespins. This makes players with a lot of kills a bigger target!"

If an assassin witnesses another kill take place, the witness is assigned to hunt the attacking player.Tip: This modification can draw the game out, so if you\u2019re trying to keep the game short, it\u2019s generally not a good idea.
