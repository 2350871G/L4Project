In order to take full advantage of what radio contests have to offer, you have to listen to a bunch of different stations to see what kind of contests they're running. One station could have a call-in contest happening at 2:00 PM, and there may be another contest happening on a different station at 5:00 PM. Once the first contest is over, switch over to the next one and try again. The more contests you try to enter, the better your odds are of winning."

In order to truly maintain a competitive edge, you have to listen to as many stations as possible and get to know them inside and out. You don't need to have a radio to be able to listen to radio stations. You can pick up stations on iPods, iPads, mp3 players, and your computer."

Occasionally, you will get extra clues or times e-mailed to you. Check all the radio stations in your area and see who is giving away what prize; you can switch stations during the day. There are reportedly less contestants who play contests listed on radio station websites which means your chances of winning are higher."
