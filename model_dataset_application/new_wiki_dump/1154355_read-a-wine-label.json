          "description":"The label will tell you where the wine was made; if it was produced in specific countries, it is an Old World wine. When someone refers to a wine as an \u201cOld World\u201d wine, this means it was produced in one of the countries that are thought to be the first countries to make wine. Some people prefer Old World wines simply because they appreciate the long history that went into the making of these wines. Old World wines tend to be lower in alcohol content, and lighter and more restrained in taste \u2013 although this is not true of every wine. Countries that are considered to be the birthplace of winemaking include: France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Austria, Croatia, Romania, Georgia, Hungary, Switzerland, Israel, and Lebanon.

Samuel Bogue\t\t\tWine Director & Consultant\t\t\t\tOld World wines tend to be lighter. Sam Bogue, a sommelier, says: \"You can find high-quality grapes to make great wines in both the New World and the Old, but generally speaking, the Old World has a climate that's a bit more well-suited for growing grapes. It's a bit cooler as a whole, which allows the grapes to naturally ripen with more acidity and less sugar. Because of that, Old World wines are typically fresh and acidic, with less alcohol. New World wines tend to be very juicy and full-bodied, and they have more alcohol.\""

If you're looking for a specific type of wine, you don't need to read the labels if the bottle isn't appropriate to that type of wine. Straight, high-shouldered bottles contain Bordeaux wines \u2013 green glass for red wines, clear glass for white. (The shoulder is the point where the bottle diameter increases.) In France, Burgundy, the Loire, and the Rhone use gently-shouldered bottles. Outside of France, this type of bottle sometimes contains Chardonnay or Pinot Noir.

It is a full-bodied red wine that can taste of black cherry, baking spices, black currant, or cedar. Merlot is a middle weight red wine that is fruitier and smoother (lower in tannins) than Cabernet Sauvignon. Syrah is a full-bodied red wine that can contain tastes of violet, black pepper, plum, and blueberry. Australia produces many Syrah (or Shiraz) wines.
