  "text":" Sauteing the Onions, Herbs, and Seafood Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the stuffed lobsters, you must preheat it. Set the temperature to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) and allow it to fully heat. Melt the butter in a skillet. Place a 9-inch (23-cm) skillet on the stove, and heat it over medium heat. Add 8 tablespoons (113 g) of unsalted butter to the pan and allow it to melt completely, which should take 3 to 4 minutes. Saute the onion until soft. Once the butter is melted, add 1 medium onion that\u2019s been finely diced to the skillet. Allow the onion to cook until it is softened but not browned, which should take about 5 minutes. You can substitute a shallot for the onion if you prefer. A shallot has a sweeter, milder taste with a hint of garlic that can be very tasty. Mix in the tarragon and parsley.

You can substitute your favorite fresh herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, sage, or basil, for the tarragon and parsley if you prefer. Add raw seafood (if using) and cook for another minute. For the stuffing, you\u2019ll need 4 ounces (113 g) of seafood. If you\u2019re using raw seafood, such as peeled shrimp or scallops, mix it in with the onion and herbs and allow it cook for 1 minute. Allow the mixture to cool and season it. After the seafood has cooked for a minute, remove the skillet from the heat. Let the mixture cool for about 3 minutes, and then mix in some kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. If you\u2019re using cooked seafood, such as cooked crabmeat or lobster, add it into the onion and herb mixture after it has cooled slightly. Preparing the Lobsters Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13-cm) of water to a large pot and place a steaming rack in the bottom. Set the pot on the stove over high heat, and allow the water to come to a boil, which should take 7 to 10 minutes. You may want to add a pinch or two of salt to the water before you boil it. Cut the lobsters in half. This stuffing recipe makes enough for 2 hard shell select lobsters that are 1 \u00bd to 2 \u00bd pounds (680 to 907 g) each.

Discard the innards but not the meat. When you\u2019ve cut the lobsters open, use the knife to remove the brain, heart, guts, and other innards. Don\u2019t remove any of the meat, though. Steam the lobsters for about 15 minutes. Once you\u2019ve cut and prepared the lobsters, place them in the pot with the boiling water with the split-side facing up.

If you prefer, you can boil the lobsters instead of steaming them. Fill \u00be of the pot with water and bring it to a boil. Place the lobsters directly in the water, cover the pot, and let them boil for 10 to 20 minutes. Finishing the Stuffing Stir the crackers into the seafood and herb mixture. While the lobster is steaming, place the seafood and herb mixture into a medium bowl. Add 1 cup (61 g) of crumbled crackers, and mix well so they\u2019re fully incorporated. You can use any type of crackers that you like, but oyster crackers, saltines, or Ritz crackers are good options. You can also substitute crumbled cornbread for the crackers if you prefer. Add a splash of lemon juice and wine. When the crackers are fully mixed into the seafood mixture, sprinkle a little lemon juice and white wine into the bowl for seasoning. Stir well to ensure that the liquids are evenly distributed. Fresh lemon juice works best for the stuffing. Season the stuffing with salt and pepper. After you\u2019ve mixed in the lemon juice and wine, add a little kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Mix well so the stuffing is evenly seasoned. Stuffing and Baking the Lobsters Spoon the seafood stuffing into the lobsters. When the lobsters are finished steaming, use a spoon to fill them with the stuffing where you removed the innards. Be careful not to pack the stuffing too tightly in the lobsters\u2019 opening or they won\u2019t bake evenly. Place the lobsters in a roasting pan with liquids. Once they\u2019re stuffed, set the lobsters in a 10 by 14 inches (25 by 35 cm) roasting pan so they\u2019re belly-side-up. Pour 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of lemon juice and a little water into the bottom of the pan so the lobsters will stay moist as they cook. Brush the lobsters with melted butter. Before you bake the lobsters, use 3 tablespoons (43 g) of melted butter to coat them. Lightly stroke the tops of the lobsters, including the stuffing, with the butter on a pastry brush. If you don\u2019t have a pastry brush, fold a piece of parchment paper into a strip and use it to brush the butter onto the lobsters. Bake the lobsters for about 15 minutes or until the stuffing is golden. After you\u2019ve brushed them with the melted butter, place the roasting pan with the lobsters in the preheated oven. Allow them to bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the stuffing is crisp and golden and the lobster claws begin to split. Serve the lobster with lemon wedges. When the lobsters are finished baking, use a pair of tongs to lift them out of the pan and onto a platter. Place lemon wedges around the edge, and serve.",
