          "description":"Porous tiles need to be sealed or resealed to protect them and keep them from breaking down over time. You can test to see if your tile is porous by placing a wet sponge on it for a minute and then removing the sponge. If there is a dark spot where you placed the sponge, then your tile is porous and needs to be sealed. If the water in the sponge stays as droplets on the surface of the tile, then the tile doesn\u2019t need to be resealed.Tip: Even if your tile has been previously sealed, you need to reapply tile sealer if a wet sponge leaves a mark behind."

A penetrating sealer won\u2019t change the appearance of the tile and will not peel or flake off over time. Penetrating sealers will last longer than topical tile sealers, but will not enhance the appearance of the tile."

The film will add a glossy sheen to the surface of the tile and can enhance the color and aesthetic of the tile, but is prone to peeling and flaking after some wear and tear. Topical tile sealers will need to be reapplied more often than penetrating tile sealers, especially if it\u2019s used in a high-traffic area such as a bathroom or hallway."

They\u2019ll protect the tile from scratches and breaks and will adhere to the surface better than water-based sealers. Ceramic and porcelain tile are much less porous than natural stone, so a solvent-based tile sealer is much more effective at coating them. You can find solvent-based tile sealers at home improvement stores and online."
