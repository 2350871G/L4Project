          "headline":"Choose a bold color if your kitchen cabinetry is a subtle tone.",
          "description":"When you pick out a new kitchen island, decide on your color scheme first. White and beige cabinets are a great template for a bold kitchen island that stands out. A bright red or green kitchen island against white cabinets is a good combination. The kitchen island is a great place to play around with bright colors that you feel are too much or too intense for the rest of your kitchen cabinetry. Since your island is a smaller part of your kitchen, you can repaint it every few years to change the style. Bold colors generally work well for kitchen islands, however some colors can negatively affect your appetite. Blue tends to be an appetite suppressant, while red and yellow have shown to increase appetites and make people eat faster."

          "headline":"Use wooden tones to create a rustic feel.",
          "description":"Wooden kitchen islands are warm gathering spots and truly feel like the heart of the kitchen. A wooden island will go well with cabinets that are a subtle painted tone, or cabinets that are also wooden too. Cherry wood and white cabinets go well together. Walnut wood matches light marble counters nicely. You can also match the wooden counter of a kitchen island to the wooden floors. Changing the stain on kitchen islands is an easy way to adjust how the wood looks without replacing the entire cabinet. You could also contrast the different wood tones in your kitchen. For example, having a dark wood kitchen island will contrast well with light wood cabinetry. This will make the kitchen island look prominent and it will draw people in. Distress the island with sandpaper, stain, or chalk paint to make it look more vintage."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Pick a stainless-steel island for an industrial feel.",
          "description":"A stainless-steel kitchen island is easy to clean and adds a more contemporary feel to older, vintage kitchens. It can work equally well in modern, more minimalist kitchens. The counter of a stainless-steel kitchen island provides a practical workbench, while the lower shelves provide great organisational space."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Match the island to the rest of the kitchen for a minimalist look.",
          "description":"Picking the same cabinets and counters as the rest of your kitchen for the kitchen island means that it will fit in with the overall character and charm well. This will help the space to flow and look balanced. For example, neutral grey kitchen cabinetry paired with light bench tops and a matching kitchen island is both minimalist and stylish. The color palette for the cabinets and kitchen island should match exactly to create a minimalist feel."

          "description":"Shelves require supports, shelving boards, screws, and doors if you want closed cabinets. Large pots and pans can be stored in deep shelves, while smaller utensils can be accommodated in shallow drawers close to the counter. Particularly if you have a small kitchen or if you have a lot of things in your kitchen, the kitchen island can provide a great, hidden space to store cooking equipment. Your kitchen island doesn\u2019t have to be a cabinet necessarily to be a good storage space. Tables or workbenches can still have open shelves below the counter which will be just as effective. Use decorative baskets or bins to hide clutter if you have open shelving."

          "headline":"Place lighting above the kitchen island.",
          "description":"You can purchase many different styles of lighting and shades from homeware and lighting stores. You can install new shades yourself, but many new light fixtures require an electrician to install them. The instructions that come with the new lighting will indicate whether or not you can install it yourself. A kitchen island is a place for gathering, cooking, and eating, all of which require good lighting. There are many different options to choose from including one statement piece placed in the centre, a row of bold shades or bare bulbs, or subtle lighting that matches the rest of your kitchen. There is a huge variety of lighting to choose from. Industrial shades over low hanging lighting work well in modern kitchens, while bare bulbs suit minimalist spaces. For rustic kitchens, pendant lighting or bulbs supported by a wooden beam are popular choices. The lighting above the kitchen island doesn\u2019t have to match the lighting in the rest of your kitchen. Statement pieces above the island work well with subtle lighting in the rest of the space. Place lighting high enough so you can easily bend over your island while you\u2019re working."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Include a sink in the island to create a food preparation station.",
          "description":"A sink that is large enough to wash vegetables and small dishes, yet small enough to not take up the entire kitchen island, will work well. If your kitchen island has closed cabinets, this will easily hide the sink pipes. You will need to contact a plumber to install the sink. This means that food can be prepared while facing the people gathered around the island. For families with school-aged kids, a sink on the kitchen island will work particularly well. This way the kids can do their homework at the island, and get help from family who are preparing a meal at the same time. A sink that seamlessly fits into the counter of the kitchen island is ideal, as it won\u2019t disrupt the overall image of the kitchen. This doesn't have to be the only sink in your kitchen. You can have a smaller sink in the kitchen island, with a larger sink or dishwasher located in the outer cabinets."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Place seating around the island to create a space to eat.",
          "description":"Add in 2-3 tall stools that fit beneath the island counter. The material of the legs and seats can either match the kitchen island or be a contrasting color. The seating can be along one side, or even around the edge that is facing outward from the kitchen too. Look for different styles of seating to add different feelings to the space. For example, upholstered seats will look more formal while metal stools are more industrial. Try to avoid placing seating in tight spaces between the kitchen island and the outer cabinets, as this could disrupt the ease and flow of your kitchen. Contrasting seating works well with kitchen islands. Try a dark, neutral toned island with seating that is made from white wood and wicker."

          "headline":"Include a butcher block on the counter.",
          "description":"You can either have a standalone butcher block on one part of the counter, or you can create the whole counter as a butcher block. If you want the butcher block to cover the whole kitchen island, drill it into the sides of the table or counter to keep it steady. A butcher block is a piece that is both practical and makes the kitchen island feel warm. Make sure to seal your butcher block with oil every so often to keep it looking nice."

          "headline":"Include open shelves in the kitchen island.",
          "description":"You can build the shelves yourself using a few boards, screws, and shelf supports from a hardware store. Shelves work particularly well on the end of the kitchen island that is facing outward, or away from the rest of the kitchen. These can be used to store cookbooks, spices, or small collectibles. Open shelving at the end of the kitchen island is both practical and a good way to display your favourite cooking related items."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Build a wine rack into the end of the island.",
          "description":"Once you assemble the wine rack using wooden planks, screws, and a wood stain or paint, it can be bolted onto the kitchen island to keep it steady. A wine rack is a great way to organise your wine collection, and also to display your tastes. Having the wine rack built into the kitchen island also makes getting a bottle quick and easy when you are having a gathering. A wine rack helps to make the most of the space within the kitchen island and also frees up space in the rest of your kitchen. You don't have to pick between having a wine rack and other shelving at the end of your kitchen island, as you can easily fit both in the space. Half and half works well. Make a rack for your coffee mugs if you don\u2019t drink wine."

Make sure that your plant gets enough sun on the kitchen island to thrive. English Ivy, Aloe Vera, and White Jasmine are all great additions to kitchen islands. Potted herbs can also make a great addition to a kitchen island, especially if you use these regularly in your cooking. They can also add a great aroma to the kitchen too! Artificial plants can also be great alternatives to real plants on your kitchen island if you don't want the hassle of taking care of the plants.

If you\u2019re having guests over, lay out the ingredients for the meal that you\u2019ll be preparing to make the space warm and inviting. Displaying ingredients will also make the space feel brighter and fresh. The ingredients that you place on the island don't necessarily have to be what you will be cooking with that evening.
