          "headline":"Cut down the thistle to its base to stress the roots.",
          "description":"Mow or cut the thistle right before or during the flowering stage so it can\u2019t distribute its seeds. Then, cut it again as soon as you notice new growth. This will deplete the roots and make it hard for the thistle to survive. If you\u2019re dealing with creeping thistle, it\u2019s best to cut it when it reaches 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) long. Typically, this will happen around early June. Don\u2019t let the flowers dry out because they\u2019ll spread thistle seeds."
        },

          "headline":"Dig out the roots if you only have a few sprouts.",
          "description":"Since thistle can grow roots as deep as 20 ft (6.1 m) deep, it\u2019s easiest to dig it up when it\u2019s just started growing. Use a shovel or trowel to dig up the ground around the root system. Then, remove all of the roots and discard them in the trash. If the roots already go deep, you'll likely need to use multiple strategies to get rid of your thistles. Dig up as much of the root system as you can. Then, watch the plot and immediately cut down any thistles that sprout back up. Don\u2019t put thistle roots or part of the thistle plant in your compost pile. If you do, it will likely blossom in the compost pile and spread from there.Did You Know? Thistle can regenerate from a fragment of a root, so it\u2019s important that you dig up the entire root system. It may take you 2 or 3 growing seasons to completely get rid of the thistle because it\u2019s so hard to remove all of the roots."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cover the area with plastic, cardboard, or 3 in (7.6 cm) of straw mulch.",
          "description":"Since thistle needs lots of sunlight to grow, mulching may prevent it from sprouting up. If you don\u2019t mind covering an entire plot, use plastic mulch or pieces of cardboard to cover the thistle patch. If you\u2019re trying to get rid of thistle in a border or flower bed, add several inches of mulch around your plants. This will allow the plants to continue to grow healthily while also choking off the thistles. When you first plant a border or bed, use plastic mulch around the plants to prevent thistle from sprouting up. This will take care of the problem before it starts back up."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Plant grass seed to combat thistles in your yard or a field.",
          "description":"Thistles need a lot of sunlight and water, so competing plants can sometimes kill them. Grasses, especially alfalfa grass, are an easy option for adding competition to a large area. Sprinkle the grass seed over the plot and let it kill your thistles. If you leave a plot empty, thistles will continue to grow there because it\u2019s an ideal environment. It\u2019s best to mow the plot regularly. The grass should easily rebound, while the thistles will likely die."

          "description":"Livestock like cattle, sheep, ponies, goats, donkeys, and llamas will snack on thistle if they\u2019re placed in a field with it. They may prefer the thistle when it\u2019s younger, but some animals will eat it at any stage of growth. If you have livestock, place them in the field where the thistle is growing. Toxic varieties include milk thistle and Italian thistle. Typically, your animals won\u2019t eat these types. However, check that your thistle is edible before you introduce your animals to it."

          "headline":"Introduce insects that eat thistle.",
          "description":"There are insects that enjoy eating thistle, which weakens the plant so it dies. While this can take an entire growing season, it\u2019s a natural way to clear thistle from your plot. Release the insects into your plot, then monitor the thistle to see if it\u2019s being eaten by them. Insects that naturally eat thistle include the adult thistle-head weevil, thistle rosette weevil, thistle-stem gall fly, flower weevil, stem-mining weevil, yellow starthistle bud weevil, and yellow starthistle hairy weevil."

          "description":"Pour household white vinegar into a spray bottle. Then, spritz the vinegar directly onto the thistle plants until the plants are dripping with vinegar. Typically, this means 1 or 2 sprays per plant. Expect the vinegar to take a few days to a week to kill the thistles. If it rains, the vinegar will wash away, so you\u2019ll likely need to do a second application. Household vinegar typically has a concentration of 5%, so it's fairly weak. You can buy a 20% concentration of vinegar at a gardening store or online. This formula isn\u2019t safe to consume, but it\u2019s great for killing weeds. It\u2019s typically labeled as \u201chorticultural\u201d vinegar and can kill the thistles in as little as 2 hours."

          "headline":"Pour epsom salt around the thistle at ground level to possibly kill it.",
          "description":"Epsom salt may starve plants because it prevents them from getting nutrients. Since it can kill any plant, sprinkle the epsom salt directly at the base of the thistles. This will slowly choke off the thistles so they die. Use regular epsom salt that you can buy at the grocery store or online. Keep in mind that in small amounts epsom salt can fertilize plants that are lacking in magnesium and sulfate. That means it doesn\u2019t always produce consistent results.Warning: Salt can kill other vegetation around the thistle, and it may also make it hard for plants to grow in the soil in the future. It\u2019s best to use it on individual plants and remove the salt from the soil once the thistle is dead."

Then, follow the instructions on the label to mix and apply your herbicide. You can find an organic herbicide at a local gardening store or online. Talk to a store employee if you\u2019re not sure which one to get. Some organic herbicides will kill all of your plants, so use them with caution."
