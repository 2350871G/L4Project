The design doesn't have to be overly complicated; when working with negative and positive space, simplicity often works best. Decide if you want to colour the background or the subject. The background is the negative space, and the subject is the positive space. By colouring just one, you'll create stark contrast between the two, and change the effect of your piece. Colour your drawing. Observe how the switched colors can change the overall impression of the drawing; to get the full effect, you can make two identical images with different colouring choices and display them together. Making Complex Drawings with Overlapping Outlines Experiment with overlap, once you've mastered the basics. Try a more complicated design where you overlap the patterns and outlines. Start colouring it from a corner. It will make it easier if you colour the first area then leave the second area empty and again colour the third area. Using this method, continue colouring. If you do not want to colour the first area then leave it untouched and colour the second area. Continue colouring. Try out scenes, patterns, anything you'd like! Here is another example of art using overlapped shading to experiment with positive and negative space. Drawing Only with Negative Space Pick a simple subject. You'll want to find a subject where the viewer can tell what it is just from the outline; whether it's a real item or a pattern, you want to keep it identifiable. Sketch the outline of the subject. If you're using a paper or pen, keep it light, and avoid any drawing or colouring on the inside of the subject area; if you need to draw there for planning/sketching purposes, then make sure you do it very lightly, in pencil, so you can erase it. Start shading the negative space. Once you have the outline in place, shade the picture; instead of focusing on the subject itself, shade everything else around it.
