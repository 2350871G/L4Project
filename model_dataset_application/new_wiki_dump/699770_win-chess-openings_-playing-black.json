Take the pawn that\u2019s in front of the bishop on the queen\u2019s side and move it forward 1 space to c5. You can capture pieces on either b4 or d4, which prevents your opponent from moving another piece to the center. The white player will usually move the knight on their king\u2019s side to f3 to defend the d4 and e5."

That way, you\u2019re protecting the first pawn you moved as well as defending the e5 square in the center of the board so your opponent can\u2019t move there without getting captured. White\u2019s next move is usually moving their queen\u2019s pawn to d4 so they control 2 squares in the center.Tip: Moving your pawns to c5 and d6 create a diagonal barrier on your queen\u2019s side to help build your defenses and limit your opponent\u2019s movement on that side of the board."
