  "text":" Prepare the Dough In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter, confectioner\u2019s sugar, lemon zest and salt until the mixture is well combined, either using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or a handheld mixer.  Turn the mixer to low speed and add 1/2 cup of flour to the bowl. Beat the flour until the flour is just incorporated. Continue adding the flour and mixing it in, 1/2 cup at a time, until all of the flour has been incorporated.  Spoon the dough onto a large piece of plastic wrap.  Pat the dough until it becomes a disc that is about 1\" (2.5 centimeters) thick.  Cover it and refrigerate the dough for 1 hour.  Bake the Cookies Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Sprinkle flour on some wax paper or a work surface.  Roll the dough onto the surface using a rolling pin. You want the dough to be about 1/8\" (3 mm) thick after you finish. Cut the dough into circles using a round cookie cutter that is about 1-1/2\" (4 cm) in diameter.  Gather the scrap dough and roll it out again, cutting out as many additional cookies as possible.  Place the cookies on the baking sheet with 1\" (2.5 cm) of space around them.  Sprinkle the cookies with granulated sugar. Reserve any remaining sugar to use in the filling. Bake the cookies for 15 to 20 minutes, until they are just starting to turn brown.  Remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the cookies to cool for 2 minutes on the stovetop.  Use a spatula to loosen them from the parchment paper and transfer them onto wire racks until they have completely cooled.  Make the Filling Mix the cream cheese, confectioner\u2019s sugar and zest in a mixing bowl, using either your stand mixer with a paddle attachment or a handheld mixer. Continue beating the mixture until it is creamy and smooth. Dip a spoon into the filling and allow the filling to drip off of your spoon. If the filling is too soft and drips easily, then add some of your reserved sugar and mix the filling again. Continue to add sugar as needed to firm up the cream cheese mixture.
