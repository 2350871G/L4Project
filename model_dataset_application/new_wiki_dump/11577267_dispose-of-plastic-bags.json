For bags that don\u2019t have a stamp, check their consistency instead. If they are degradable or easy to tear, then you should throw them in the trash. For example, food wrappers, like the bags prepackaged salad lettuce comes in, cannot be recycled. Since the bag is thin and tears when you pull it, you can tell it belongs in the trash. Most bags are made from high-density polyethylene, indicated by the #2 symbol. Low-density polyethylene bags, such as produce bags, have the #4 symbol."
