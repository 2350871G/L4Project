While you can leave the pointy tips on the leaves, they'll be easier to eat if they aren't prickly. Rub lemons over the artichoke halves and put them on a baking sheet. Cut 2 lemons in half so they release some of their juice. Rub the lemons over the entire surface of the artichoke halves. Then lay the artichokes on a baking sheet so the cut-side is facing up. The lemon juice will prevent the artichokes from browning. If you don't have a baking sheet, you can use a baking dish as long as the artichokes fit in a single layer. Brush the artichokes with oil and fill with garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper. Use a pastry brush to coat the cut sides of the artichoke halves with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil or melted butter. Roughly chop 6 cloves of peeled garlic and divide them between the centers of each artichoke half. Then put a few sprigs of fresh rosemary in the artichokes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. If you prefer, substitute your favorite herb for the rosemary. For example, use fresh thyme, parsley, oregano, or basil. Flip the artichokes and brush the other sides with oil. Use your fingers or tongs to turn each artichoke over so the cut-side is down on the sheet. Brush the top sides of the artichokes with some of the oil and sprinkle more salt and pepper over them. Bake the artichokes for 40 to 50 minutes. Put the baking sheet in the preheated oven and roast the artichokes for 15 minutes. Then cover the sheet with aluminum foil and bake the artichokes for 25 to 35 more minutes. To test if the artichokes have finished roasting, insert a fork or knife into an artichoke half. The artichoke should feel tender. Remove the herbs and serve the roasted artichoke halves. Turn off the oven and remove the baking sheet. Transfer the roasted artichokes to serving plates and remove the herbs. Squeeze a little lemon juice over them and serve them warm.
