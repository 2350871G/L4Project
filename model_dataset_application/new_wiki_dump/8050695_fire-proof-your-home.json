          "description":"One way to protect your home from fire is to create a border around your house that is essentially fireproof. Gravel and concrete on the ground help create a break line, such as driveways and patios. You can also use small, fire-retardant plants that grow close to the ground. Some fire-resistant plants include California lilac, ornamental strawberry, yellow ice plant, French lavender, and California Fuchsia. Look for plants that are low-resin and high in moisture content. Try to make a break of 100 feet around your home. This area should be composed of concrete and spaced-out plants (use mulch). Focus especially on any area that moves uphill towards your house, as that's where fire is most likely to strike. Clear around other structures, too, such as sheds, making sure to clean out the undergrowth."

A firetruck needs a solid road to get your house, including your driveway, so you need to ensure that even your driveway is solid enough to sustain a firetruck. It also helps to have a good place to turn the truck around. In addition, think about anything that blocks access, such as a gate. It's best to leave access open if you're in a fire-prone area."
