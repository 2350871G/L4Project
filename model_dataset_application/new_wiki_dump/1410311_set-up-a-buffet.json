          "description":"Decide how much you want to spend altogether, including food, silverware, plates, and drinks. Next, reduce the amount you want to spend by 15%. The remaining 85% is what you will have to actually spend. The extra 15% allows you some extra money for unexpected costs and things like taxes, tips, and potential emergencies. Keep track of what you\u2019re spending by keeping all of the receipts spent on the buffet together. Create a budget chart, either on a sheet of paper or in a computer program, such as Excel or Microsoft Word."

Arranging your table in advance will ensure that you are not making last minute decisions and preparations. If you have more time, consider drawing the set-up on a sheet of paper. Choose the one that you like the best, then recreate it using your table and dishes."

          "headline":"Choose a room with a lot of potential open space.",
          "description":"Ten square feet is an ideal amount of room to fit all guests comfortably with room for getting food and mingling. Eight square feet allows for some seating, seven and a half square feet can be comfortable for smaller crowds, and six square feet should be the minimum amount of room that you designate for the buffet. If your location has multiple rooms, consider serving the food and drinks in one room, then having the seating in another room."

          "headline":"Place the table in the center of the room for the best flow.",
          "description":"Clear the room you plan to use for your event, including all clutter, furniture, and decorations. Place the serving table in the middle of the room, then place additional tables to either side for things like plates, silverware, and cups. This will allow the guests to access to the food from both sides of the buffet table and will keep the line moving quickly. An eight-foot table will hold enough food for twenty to thirty people. You will need to put multiple tables together if you are having more people than that over. Make sure that you have a set of serving spoons and tongs for each dish--one for each side of the table."

          "description":"By situating the beverage table away from the food table, you give your guests a chance to choose their food and put the plates down before pouring a drink. This minimizes the potential for spills. This is another way to ensure that your guests can maneuver the lines with ease. Consider having separate tables for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Water should be served at its own table. Depending on how many guests you have, you may want to have multiple pitches. This way, your guests aren't waiting in line."

Leave plenty of space in front of and on the sides of the table, just in case people decide to pause for a moment. This reduces the chance of crowding. Keep the types of food as separated as possible. For example, keep dessert far from the first course of the meal. If you will have vegetarian and/or vegan options, it might be a good idea to keep those separate from the non-vegetarian and non-vegan tables. Consider having a smaller table set aside for appetizers. You can place this closer to the wine or champagne table, even."

You don\u2019t have to use your fine china, but a table is more appetizing if the set up looks nice. It\u2019s okay to use plastic silverware, plates, and cups, as long as it is all new and clean. Don\u2019t put your food out in greasy, cardboard boxes. Instead, use plastic or metal containers. You will also need a tablecloth. An expensive tablecloth will potentially get ruined by the mess, but look for one that adds cheer to the table. Decide on a color or a theme when putting out everything on the table. This will bring the look of the table together and make the meal look more appealing. Sometimes, less is more when it comes to decorations. Rather than choosing lots of colors and patterns, stick with just one or two solid colors instead. Many catering places will offer things like plates, cups, and silverware. Rental places for tables and chairs will sometimes have tablecloths that you can borrow as well."

You don't, however, want to pile the plates too high, or they will be in danger of tipping over. Be sure to put condiments near the type of food they belong with.

It can be cumbersome to try to hold on to knives, forks, spoons and linens along with a plate while your guests are trying to serve themselves.

This will allow guests to know what the dish is before they put it on their plate, which helps eliminate a lot of uneaten and thrown away food. Make sure the labels are written in bold, large, and clear writing that all guests will be able to read with ease. Typed labels will be more legible than handwritten labels. If a food contains a common allergen, such as peanuts, it would be a good idea to add a warning label as well, such as: Contains Peanuts.

Six to eight items is a good amount to give everyone enough choices. The serving size depends on the amount of people you are expecting. You can send out a list of ideas for dishes and ask for feedback a week or two before the buffet. Be sure to have a variety of food. Don't have six or eight all-meat items. Include dishes with vegetables and grains in them as well. If you'll be serving meat, try to have two different choices, such as chicken and fish, rather than two chicken dishes."

If you\u2019re having a buffet for a holiday, choose decorations that correspond with that holiday. Saint Patrick\u2019s Day decorations could be green, white, and gold. A Fourth of July buffet can be decked out in red, white, and blue. If you really want candles, consider LED or battery-operated candles instead. They last longer and you don't have to worry about fire hazards. Don't get too carried away with the decorations. A scatter of confetti is better than large ornaments and figures that take up too much space. If you want to have a statement decoration, consider putting it on a table that won't be frequented, such as the cake table or drinks table."
