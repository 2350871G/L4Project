          "description":"If you are putting accent pillows on a sofa that is a typical size, around 16\u201d-18\u201d x 16\u201d-18\u201d, standard sized pillows will fit neatly in the space. Standard square accent pillows are around 18 inches. Having average sized pillows on your sofa will keep the area comfy looking but not overwhelmed by the pillows. If you have a larger sofa or a larger bed, go for oversized square pillows, which are around 24 inches. Oversized pillows can create a comfy feel and make the space more inviting. If your sofa has a low back and is slim, go for square pillows that are 16 inches. This way, the pillows do not overwhelm the sofa and still complement the size of the sofa well."

          "headline":"Select pillows with contrasting shapes.",
          "description":"Accent pillows come in four main shapes: bolster, square, rectangle, and round. Go for a mix of shapes to add dimension to the sofa or bed, especially if the space is sparsely decorated. Rectangle shaped pillows are good for supporting your back and neck, so they may be a good base shape for a bed or a sofa. Then, add two round pillows or two bolster pillows to create variety on the bed or sofa. If you have a couch made of leather, bolster pillows are a good option as they provide lumbar support and won\u2019t slip down when propped up on the couch. If your bed or couch has severe or sharp lines with very little padding, soften it with round pillows. If the bed or couch is more soft and squishy, sharpen it with large square pillows."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use pillows with texture.",
          "description":"Contrasting textures can add a sense of design to the space. Look for pillows that will contrast the texture of your sofa or bed. Contrast a set of linen pillows against a smooth leather couch or pillows made of silk against a fuzzy couch or a bed. You can also use pillows that have a texture that will help them stay in place on your sofa or bed. For example, you may go for pillows made of linen on a silk couch so they stay in place. Or you may use cotton accent pillows on linen sheets so there is traction and the pillows do not shift or move around."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Select accent pillows with high quality filling.",
          "description":"To ensure your accent pillows last and do not become lumpy or saggy, go for ones with high quality filling. Cheaper accent pillows will be filled with feather, foam, or a synthetic mix. However, if you plan to use the accent pillows to lean on or sleep on, cheaper ones will not last. Instead, go for accent pillows that contain goose down, which is softer and higher quality. If you are a vegan or want a cruelty-free option for pillows, you can try pillows made of high quality synthetic material. Pillows stuffed with wheat husks and cotton are also good options."

          "description":"Create a color palette based on the base color of the couch or the bed and stick to it. Choose one main shade and then one to two complementary shades for the accent pillows. This way, the accent pillows look cohesive and fit well with the color of the sofa or the bed. For example, let\u2019s say you have a couch that is white. You choose a main shade like cobalt blue for the larger accent pillows. Then, you choose accent pillows in complementary colors like silver, red, peach, yellow, light green, or light pink to go with the main color palette."

          "description":"If you want to have accent pillows with a print on them, go for a balance between prints and solids. Start with one solid pillow, one simple print, and one busy print. Have the largest pillow be the busy print and then have the solid pillow be the next largest. Finish with the simple print in the smallest size. For example, you may have one striped accent pillow, one pillow with a woven design, and one solid pillow. Arrange them so the woven design is the largest, followed by the solid pillow, and then the striped pillow. For a more simplified look, you can try having one bold print and one solid color for the accent pillows. Then, add or remove a less bold print as you see fit."

If you are adding accent pillows with a print to your sofa, think about how the print complements the color of the walls in the room and the other furnishings. Ideally, you want the color scheme of the accent pillows to reflect the color scheme of the room. You may choose accent pillow colors based on the colors already in the room. This way, you know the accent pillows will complement the space well. You can try taking fabric swatches of the accent pillows and comparing them to the color of the walls in the room and the color of the other furnishings to ensure it all works together."
