  "text":" Gathering the Supplies Purchase a plastic rose candy mold. You can pick up a mold at nearly any craft or baker store and these roses often come in a variety of sizes. Consider purchasing a few molds so you can make several roses at one time. Pick up chocolate colored melts. While roses are lovely in a shade of red you don\u2019t have to limit yourself to reality. Try blue or purple roses--they\u2019ll be just as fun and delicious. Even standard chocolate color can hold its own as well. Buy cookie sticks. Each rose needs a stem so go for the long stemmed roses and get the cookie sticks. You could also use craft sticks but that will produce short flowers. Look for green-colored cookie sticks if possible or you can wrap each stick with green foil. Grab a basket or vase, green Styrofoam and green craft grass. This will hold your arrangement in place. If you would rather display your arrangement in a flower box, purchase a long rose box and plenty of tissue to pad around the arrangement and protect it. Making the Chocolate Roses Place cookie sticks into the bottom of each mold so its ready to be covered with chocolate.  Divide chocolate colors into microwave safe bowls. Make sure the bowls are deep enough to hold the chips in place without spilling over the top. Microwave each bowl on half power for approximately 60 seconds. Remove from microwave and stir. If pieces have not melted, continue heating in 30 second increments. In some cases the pieces are almost melted but a little stirring will blend the chocolate together nicely. Be vigilant when melting chocolate. It can burn and scorch leaving you sans chocolate. Immediately spoon melted chocolate into molds. Smooth air bubbles to avoid holes in your roses by gently tapping the molds on a table or desk. Place molds in the refrigerator and allow to chill for 15 or more minutes. You want the edges to look slightly frosty. Remove flowers from molds by gently twisting mold tray and set flowers on a clean baking sheet out of the way. Rinse and clean empty molds by running them under warm water and washing with mild dish soap. Rinse and allow to air dry. Creating the Chocolate Rose Arrangement Line the bottom of your basket or vase with the Styrofoam. If necessary cut to fit the vase or basket. Sprinkle the green craft grass along the bottom. Depending on the type of arrangement you want to make, cover the entire Styrofoam piece with grass so no foam is visible. Insert rose sticks into the foam and arrange to desired design. Group together or move them apart--either way they\u2019ll be eaten in no time.",
