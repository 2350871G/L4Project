Beat the wet ingredients with an electric mixer until they're completely combined. Sift one box of dry strawberry cake mix and 4 tablespoons of dry instant strawberry pudding mix to the wet ingredients. For a stronger banana flavor, you could use dry instant banana pudding instead of strawberry."

Pour in 1/4 cup (56 g) of melted butter and stir the batter until the butter is incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and beat the batter for another 15 to 20 seconds on medium speed. Avoid over mixing the batter or it may make tough cupcakes."
