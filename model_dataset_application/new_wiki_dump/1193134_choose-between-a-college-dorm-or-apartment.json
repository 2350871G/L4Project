          "description":"When you begin to consider your finances, see if there's a major difference in rent costs between an apartment and the dorm. Oftentimes, the cost of rent alone is cheaper off campus. But don't always assume the rent of off campus housing will be cheaper than the dorm - some apartments can be rather expensive. The monthly rent for a dorm may be quite high and may be almost the same level of some apartments. If you do not currently have an apartment lined up, you can browse listings online to try and get a general sense of what the price range tends to be in the area. You should be able to find out how much a dorm costs on your university's website. Write down a rough range of costs of apartments versus campus housing. For example, monthly dorm rent is $900 per month, while the average rent in an apartment is $550. Remember, you do not have to pay rent alone. Usually, you will end up having roommates. When figuring out your rent responsibilities, consider if you'll be splitting the rent with a roommate. Having roommates will ensure you will be living in a higher quality apartment. You may have to make the decision - would you rather live in a cheaper, lower quality apartment and be able to pay the rent alone, or you rather live in a higher quality apartment and deal with roommates?"

          "description":"Rent is only one of many expenses to consider. While rent may be cheaper, you want to make sure you look at all your options. One advantage of dorm life is that many expenses are taken care of. Things like internet, heat, water, and other utilities may be covered in the dorms but not off campus.. Many apartments do cover basic utilities such as water and heat, and that might be something to check into. Be aware that the rent may be more expensive with apartments that cover more utilities than with apartments that do not."

          "headline":"Do any apartments pay utilities?",
          "description":"If not, you will end up having to pay things like a water bill, a heating bill, and an electricity bill. If you know anyone living off campus, ask them about how much they pay for utilities. You will also have to contact an internet or cable company to set up your internet. See how much internet and cable cost per month through local providers. Many apartments may provide free Wi-Fi internet with the rent and some may even provide a free basic cable subscription. For better quality internet access with better privacy, security, etc. and more premium cable TV options, you are wise to provide your own cable and internet access. Add how much you'll be paying for utilities to your monthly rent. For example, say you'll pay about $80 a month in things like water and gas and $40 a month for internet. Remember, the hypothetical average rent is $550. Now, the cost of living per month is $670 off campus versus $900 on campus."

You will no longer have a meal plan provided by your college, so you'll have to prepare your own food.. Think about how much you will reasonably spend on groceries. Will you spend about $60 a week? Add this to your running total for off campus expenses. Now, you're looking at around $910 a month. Keep in mind, you may be able to stay on your campus's meal plan for a fee. If you don't like cooking for yourself, see how much a meal plan costs per month."

Are there any on-campus amenities only open to students who live in the dorm? If you don't use a lot of your dorm or university's amenities, this may not be a big deal for you. However, say you go to the gym every day. Losing your gym pass could cause problems. Check to see how you would go about replacing any amenities you lose. For example, look into gym memberships. Is there anything in your price range? Maybe you find something for $40 a month. Add that to the $910 total of rent and utilities. The cost off campus is now roughly $950."

However, this may not necessarily be the case given the factors in your area. Remember, cost is only one factor to consider. The impact on your social life and academic responsibility should also be taken into account."

People may be eager to make new friends. There may be get-togethers hosted by your dorm, where you'll have an opportunity to meet fellow students. You will also eat in the cafeteria with other students, allowing you to bond over food. If you're an older student, however, you may already have an established friend group. If you feel confident you will still see your friends off campus, you probably won't miss out on much by leaving the dorms. If anything, you'll get the chance to experience something new. Off-campus apartments are open to the general public, so you are going to be living with people of all ages.

You may, for example, have to sign in overnight visitors. You may also have to sign in when coming back to the dorm late. In an apartment, you will not have these restrictions. Most dorms do not allow pets, but many apartments do allow having pets. If you miss having your pet while in college, you can consider living off campus.
