          "description":"Understanding the mechanic\u2019s grip will help you to build a solid foundation for learning cardistry skills and maneuvers. Hold the deck vertically in your palm, with your thumb positioned down 1 long edge. Place your index finger along the top short edge and wrap your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the other long edge of the deck. Make sure that there is a gap between your palm and the deck as you hold it. The deck should be supported by your fingers and not resting flat in your palm. The mechanic\u2019s grip is the default position for holding a deck of cards. This is also the easiest grip to perform in cardistry. The mechanic\u2019s grip is also known as the dealer\u2019s grip."

Position your index finger on the deck of cards, approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) away from your middle finger. Then use your index finger to push the front card against your middle finger so that the card rotates clockwise by 45\u00b0. Try to pivot the card so that it turns outward rather than upward."

Quickly extend your thumb upward so that the card sticks to your thumb and moves upward, separating from the deck and losing contact with your middle finger. To position the cards at the beginning, hold the deck vertically in your palm with your thumb wrapping around 1 long edge and your middle, ring, and pinky fingers wrapping around the other long edge. The card ends up balanced on your thumb, not touching the deck. During this move, position your middle finger in the center of the card and your thumb just off the center. If your hands feel quite dry, rub your thumb and middle finger together so that the card can stick more easily to your thumb."

Apply pressure to the deck with your thumb and then move your thumb upward toward your index finger to spread the cards into a fan shape. Support the back of the deck with your index and middle fingers while it\u2019s fanned. Start the 100 fan move by taking half of the deck and hold it horizontally away from your palm. Support 1 short edge with your middle and ring fingers, and 1 long edge with your index and pinky fingers. The 100 fan move is easiest to do with a brand new deck. When the cards are fanned, keep them supported using just your thumb and index fingers. You can spread your middle, ring, and pinky fingers outward and away from the deck."

Swing the third section of cards downward, bringing it under the second section to join the first, to form 3 sections again. Then repeat this sequence again to complete the Sybil cut. To make the \"Z\" formation, hold the deck in 1 hand and use your other hand to lift half of it up at 1 short edge so that it looks like a \"<\" shape. Then repeat the process with the top half of the deck while leaving a few cards positioned diagonally across the center to connect 2 halves, making a \"Z\" shape. To break the deck into 4 sections, keep the second and third sections connected with your thumb and use your index finger to lift the top, short edge of the third section to make the fourth section. Let the first section relax in your palm. To swing the third section of cards downward, keep the second, third, and fourth sections connected with your thumb and turn your wrist down. Aim for the first and second sections to remain upright and for the third and fourth sections to rotate upside down. The top card of the deck remains the same as you perform the Sybil cut."
