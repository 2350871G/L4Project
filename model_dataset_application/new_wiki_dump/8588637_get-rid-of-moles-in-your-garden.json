Moles will typically leave heaps of dirt the size of baseballs or softballs when tunneling. Check daily as these mounds can appear quickly as moles make their way through the yard. A typical mole might make between 50-100 mounds in a single month. EXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSteve Masley\t\t\tOrganic Vegetable Gardener\t\t\t\tMoles burrow around your yard to make tunnels.

While moles only tend to appear above ground surface when they are looking for a mate, you might observe active signs of their tunnelling (e.g. dirt being tossed, grass moving). Moles are also likely to appear outdoors after a warm rain, when things are moist and temperate."
