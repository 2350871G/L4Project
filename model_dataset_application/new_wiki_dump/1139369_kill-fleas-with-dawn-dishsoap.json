          "description":"This temperature will be warm enough to keep your pet comfortable without shocking it. Fill the bathtub so that the water only comes up to around your pet\u2019s stomach. For example, if the bottom of your pet\u2019s belly is about 1 foot (0.30 m) off the ground, then you should fill the tub with about 1 foot (0.30 m) of water. If you\u2019re washing a smaller animal, such as a ferret, fill a large bucket with lukewarm water instead of a bathtub."

          "description":"Avoid getting any water in your pet\u2019s eyes or ears, since it may irritate them. Make sure all of the fur is completely soaked through before proceeding. This is especially important for pets with thick fur, since it will take more water for them to get completely soaked."

          "headline":"Apply the soap to your pet\u2019s fur until it\u2019s completely lathered.",
          "description":"The amount of soap you use will depend on how large your pet is, as well as how badly it\u2019s infested with fleas. Start with a small quantity of dish soap (e.g., around 2 to 3 teaspoons (9.9 to 14.8 mL)) and add additional dish soap as needed. Start applying the soap at the neck and work your way down towards the tail. Avoid getting any of the soap in your pet\u2019s eyes or ears. Be gentle while scrubbing, but make sure you scrub deeply enough to get to the skin where the fleas will hide. If the pet cries, you're scrubbing too roughly. If your pet\u2019s coat is particularly thick, try using a pet brush to get the soap deep down into its fur.Tip: Since the fleas will run to your pet\u2019s head once you start soaking them, it's best to wet and lather up the neck first, then the rest of your pet. This will create a barrier to prevent the fleas from invading your pet's face and ears."

          "headline":"Wait 5 minutes, then rinse all of the soap off of your pet\u2019s fur.",
          "description":"Allow about 5 minutes for the dish soap to completely kill the fleas before you begin rinsing. Use a cup of water or a handheld shower head to wash the soap off. Start from the top of your pet\u2019s body and work your way down towards the tail. For best results, use a flea comb to brush your pet\u2019s fur as you rinse off the soap to make sure you\u2019re removing as many fleas as possible. You may need to spray a lot of water in a single area in order to completely rinse off all of the dish soap. Be very cautious when washing around the eyes. If contact with the eyes occurs, rinse them with cool water and dry them with a towel."

You can also use a hair dryer on low heat to dry your pet, although it\u2019s much safer to simply use a towel. To be extra safe, run a flea comb over your pet\u2019s fur once they\u2019re completely dry to check for any fleas you may have missed during the bath. A cat will likely be very tense from this experience and will probably run away from you immediately. Be careful as you dry it off to avoid getting scratched."

          "description":"Some fleas may have escaped your initial washing or simply survived exposure to the dish soap. Keep in mind that fleas will run to the head and face to hide. This means you will probably have to add a tiny drop of detergent to your pet\u2019s head on your second washing. You may need to wash your pet 1 or 2 extra times, depending on the severity of their flea infestation. If you notice more fleas within a couple of days after bathing, simply repeat the process every couple of days, then use a flea medication to finish them off. You can either give your pet a flea collar or apply a topical flea solution like Frontline Plus to your furry friend. To make sure your home is completely rid of fleas, vacuum your flooring and upholstery frequently (at least once a day) to kill any fleas and flea eggs that survived your pet\u2019s bath."
