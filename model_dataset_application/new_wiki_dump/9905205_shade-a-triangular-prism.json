    {
      "headline":"Shade with three tones.",
      "description":"In this simple method, we use three tones: Light tone, mid-tone, and dark tone. These are pure white, pure black, and your choice of grey in between. The grey doesn't have to be neutral. You can add a bit of warmth or cool depending on the effect you want to achieve. The light tone should be closest to the light source, the mid-tone on the face receiving some, but not all of the light, and the shadow on the face opposite to the light source. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/d0\\/Shade-a-Triangular-Prism-step-3.png\\/459px-Shade-a-Triangular-Prism-step-3.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/d\\/d0\\/Shade-a-Triangular-Prism-step-3.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":463,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":765.4676258992806,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

      "headline":"Use a gradient.",
      "description":"You can do this by altering your pressure. Press hardest where you want the shadow, and barely press at all for the highlights. Blend this to the extreme with your finger, tissue paper, a tool, or something else used for blending. There should be no distinction between areas of the shape. Instead, it should flow very smoothly from one shading extreme to the other."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Crosshatch.",
      "description":"Crosshatching is drawing lines upon lines, each layer going in a different direction. The closer your lines are and the more layers you have, the darker that area will be. You can represent crosshatching digitally with a half-tone layer."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Make the faces different degrees of mid-tone and darken the areas where the lines meet.",
      "description":"Shading vertices is a common tactic used to make drawings pop out at you. Be sure to make the mid-tones match the positioning of the light source, however, as you do not want this to look flat."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Shade in strips.",
      "description":"A pro for using this method is that you do not have to blend. Simply mark off sections and color them. A con of this method is that if you do not get the lines exactly right, the shape can look warped. However, you can use this to your advantage by making it look like an optical illusion, or whatever you think is cool."

      "headline":"Use colors.",
