  "text":" Prepare the Gelatin Place 2 muffin tins or one square pan into the refrigerator to chill. This will help the gelatin to set in a shorter amount of time. Combine the strawberry gelatin with the water in a saucepan. Let the gelatin bloom for 1 to 2 minutes. Place the saucepan on the stovetop over low heat and stir the gelatin with a whisk for 5 minutes before removing it from the heat.  Add the rum and stir until combined. Pour the contents of the saucepan into a bowl and set the bowl aside. Wash the saucepan.  Combine the pina colada gelatin with the coconut milk, allowing the mixture to bloom for 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir the mixture together on the stovetop, over low heat, for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat before adding the Malibu rum. Pour the white layer into a separate bowl and wash the saucepan again.  Combine the blue raspberry gelatin with 3/4 cup water, allowing the mixture to bloom for 1 to 2 minutes. Cook over low heat for 5 minutes before removing the pan from the heat and stirring in the vodka. Pour the blue layer into a separate bowl.  Assemble the Shots in a Muffin Pan Remove the chilled muffin tins from the refrigerator and spray it lightly with nonstick cooking spray.  Pour 1 tablespoon of the red gelatin into each muffin cup. Place the tins back in the refrigerator and chill for 7 minutes. Top the red layer with 1 tablespoon of the white gelatin. Chill for 7 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of blue gelatin on top of the white layer. Chill for an additional 7 minutes. Top the blue layer with 1 tablespoon of white gelatin, chilling for 7 more minutes.  Continue alternating a colored layer with a white layer and chilling the muffin pans until each layer is set.  Chill for 2 to 4 hours before serving the shots.  Press your index finger gently into the center of a shot.  Use your thumb and middle finger to loosen the shot from the muffin tin.  Scoop the shot from the muffin tin with an offset spatula.  Place the shot on a tray.  Continue removing the shots and plate all of them on the tray for serving.  Assemble the Shots in a Square Pan Pour 1/2 of the red gelatin mixture into the square pan that you've removed from the refrigerator. Chill the red gelatin for 15 minutes or until it has set. Ladle 1/3 of the white gelatin mixture over the red gelatin and chill for 15 additional minutes.  Ladle 1/2 of the blue gelatin mixture over the white gelatin and chill for 15 minutes.  Continue building alternating colored and white layers until you have about 7 layers of gelatin. The top layer should consist of blue gelatin. Chill the entire assembly for 2 to 4 hours.  Cut the shots into squares using a sharp knife.  Use a spatula or an offset spatula to remove the shots from the pan.  Place the shots on a tray for serving. ",
