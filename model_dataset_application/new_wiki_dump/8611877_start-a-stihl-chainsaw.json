Use your right hand to start the chainsaw, then follow the same directions for pulling the starter rope and starting your tool as you would when beginning from a sitting position. Turning On an Electric Chainsaw Connect to a power supply. The power supply you connect your chainsaw to must be of the same voltage. Check your chainsaw\u2019s manual for information if you are not sure about your model\u2019s specifications. Use an extension cord if necessary. Find secure, balanced footing. You can start an electric chainsaw from a seated or standing position as necessary. As you would for a gas-powered chainsaw, check and make sure that the surrounding area is free from people and obstructions. Your body should feel balanced before you begin. Pull the hand guard toward handle. The hand guard will be located just in front of the handlebar. Pull it toward you (and the back of the chainsaw) until it clicks.
