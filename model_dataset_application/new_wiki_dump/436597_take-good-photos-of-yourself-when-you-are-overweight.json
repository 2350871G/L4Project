Stand with your back straight, shoulders down, and chest out. Finally, flex your stomach to bring in your waist..\nDon\u2019t stand flat-footed. Instead, balance your weight on the ball of your feet. Ladies should cross their feet while they stand. This will slim their hips and can also make a photo more interesting."

This will elongate your arm and help it look toned. Men can put a hand in their pocket, holding the arm away from their body. Next, hide your other arm behind your body or gently rest it on a chest-high surface. If you have to face the camera directly and want your waist to look smaller, put both of your hands on your hips. Hold purses or bags slightly away from your body or over a self-conscious area."

However, don\u2019t simply point your chin at the camera as this looks unnatural. Angle your head slightly as you pose by tilting it to the left or right. Remember to keep your back straight while you pose. Otherwise, you may look like a turtle with your head stretched out. Men should consider growing a beard that will help accentuate the jawline."

Put the other hand around or on your partner\u2019s shoulder. If you want to look extra slim stand slightly behind your partner. Remember, never flatten your arm against your body. Women can put the hand closest to the camera on their lowered hip and push their elbows back. Men can put a hand in their pocket and push the elbow out."

Next, either put your hands on your hips or around the shoulders of your picture partners. If you can choose who you stand between, choose people with similar body types to your own. This will reduce a contrast between body types in photos. If you\u2019re especially self-conscious about your arms simply put them around your picture partners\u2019 waists. They won\u2019t be seen in the picture at all. Women can cross their legs one in front of the other to appear slimmer."

If you\u2019re wearing dark clothing, pose against a light background for a slimming effect. If you\u2019re wearing light clothing, pose against a slightly darker or lighter background. If the background is too dark, it will make you appear bulky. Find natural sources of light. Avoid fluorescent lights at all costs.

For example, if you like the way your face looks but you feel like your arm looks bulky, crop your arm out. Similarly, if you took your selfie in a bathroom, make sure you crop out the toilet or any beauty product clutter on the sink. Download a selfie app to help you crop photos more easily. These apps will also include filters that you can use on your selfie before you post them.
