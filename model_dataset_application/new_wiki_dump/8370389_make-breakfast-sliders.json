Use a whisk to lightly beat the mixture until it is light and and foamy. You can season the eggs further if you\u2019d like.

          "description":"Once the butter is melted, pour the egg mixture into the center of the pan so it pushes the butter to the sides. Use a rubber spatula to gently stir the eggs to start scrambling them until they form large clumps, which should take 3 to 5 minutes. If you don\u2019t have a rubber spatula, a wooden spoon will also work. If you aren't a fan of scrambled eggs, you can use your favorite type for the sliders. A sunny side up or egg over easy would both work for the sandwich, as would over medium or over hard eggs. If you prefer a vegan option, you can warm crumbled tofu in a pan for 2 to 3 minutes. To add flavor, saute the tofu with diced onion and minced garlic."
