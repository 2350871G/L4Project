Depending on the pepper, there may be quite a bit of flesh remaining attached to the stem, which can be cut free and chopped if desired. Alternatively, the point of a sharp paring or similar knife can be inserted between the stem and the shoulder. Then rotate the pepper in one hand while holding the knife firmly in the other.

Insert the point of a smallish, sharp knife (such as a paring knife) into the pepper and cut through the ribs close to the flesh. Rotate the pepper\u2019s body and continue cutting until all the ribs and seeds are loose, and remove. When using hot peppers, don't touch your eyes or other sensitive areas until you've washed your hands thoroughly, preferably in an acidic solution (a little vinegar or lemon juice does the trick).
