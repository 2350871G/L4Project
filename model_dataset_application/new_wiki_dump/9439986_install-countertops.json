Then disconnect the hot and cold water supply lines from your faucet. Use a screwdriver to take off the sink brackets located underneath the sink. Then, stand over the sink and get your fingers underneath the outside of the lip of the sink and pull it up and out. If you have a friend that can help you, one person can loosen the brackets underneath and the other can pull the sink out from above. If your sink has a bead of caulk holding it in place, push it up from the bottom and cut the silicone with a utility knife."

          "description":"Use a pry bar, a hammer, and a putty knife to remove the backsplash and any caulking or glue that\u2019s holding the counter in place. Run your knife where the backsplash meets the wall so there\u2019s minimal wall damage. Use a screwdriver to unscrew any screws that are attaching the current countertops to the cabinets underneath. Then, gently pull off your countertops from the front one at a time, starting with the smallest piece. Imagine prying off your countertops the same way you\u2019d open a car hood. That way, the back will be loose and easy to remove."

Find the part of the new backsplash that gaps furthest from the wall and set a compass to this exact width.

Installing Butcher Block Countertops Sand and wipe down your new countertops. Use a palm sander or an oscillating sander to sand the entire surface of your butcher block countertops. Start with 150 grit and work up to 220. Then, wipe the countertops down with a damp cloth and allow them to dry. Sand and wipe them once or twice more until they no longer feel rough to the touch.

Give the oil a few minutes to soak in, and then wipe off the excess with another clean cloth. Do this monthly to keep your butcher block in good condition. Installing Granite Countertops Set the granite in place. Set each piece of your new granite countertops in place one at a time. Make sure each piece is set correctly and is positioned flush against the wall. Granite can be extremely heavy, so have a friend or 2 assist you in lifting and placing each countertop piece. Use shims to level the counter. Once all of the pieces are in place, you\u2019ll likely notice that there are gaps or places where the countertop isn\u2019t sitting level. To fix this, place small plastic shims between the top of the cabinet and the bottom of the granite. Check multiple places with a level to make sure your countertop is perfectly flat. Glue the counter down with silicone sealant. Lift up or take off the granite pieces.
