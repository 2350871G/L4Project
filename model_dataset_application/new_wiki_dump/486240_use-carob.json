One of the main reasons for preferring it over chocolate is that a person has allergies or unpleasant reactions to chocolate. Chocolate causes headaches and some other reactions in sensitive persons. In this case, carob can be substituted without the side effects of chocolate. Another reason is simply that carob adds its own taste dimension to food."

However, carob can be used in some of the ways that we use chocolate (such as coating raisins, almonds etc.) and as explained above, you can use less or no sugar with carob. Here are some possible substitute ideas:\nUse the powder instead of cocoa powder;\nUse in place of hot chocolate powder (the sweetness and lack of dairy products is good for those with dietary restrictions);\nSubstitute carob chips for chocolate chips in cookie and ice cream recipes;\nUse in a variety of baked goods in place of sugar. It will impart a slight brown colouring, as well as its own flavour but you can make the most of its fifty percent content of natural sugar to avoid added sugar content."
