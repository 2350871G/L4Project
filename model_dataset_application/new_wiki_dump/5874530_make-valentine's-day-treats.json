  "text":" Heart Cupcakes Bake the cupcakes. Use a mix, or bake from scratch. Chocolate or vanilla work best and are usually the most popular flavors. Cut the top off each cupcake after baking. Use a knife to cut straight across the top of the wrapper. Place the top piece aside; you'll be reusing it shortly. Frost the bottom half of each cupcake. Once you've made the frosting, spread it over the whole top of the bottom piece of each cupcake. Cut a heart shape from the top part. Take the piece you cut off earlier and use the cookie cutter to press out a heart shape from the center. Keep the outline of the heart, removing the internal heart shape piece (you're allowed to eat it). Replace the top piece with the cut-out heart shape. There will now be a heart of frosting pushing up through the cupcake. Repeat for each cupcake left. Decorate. Add sprinkles to the frosted part. The cupcakes are now ready for serving. Heart Shaped Cookies Bake the cookies. Cut out heart shapes before baking. Make frosting. (This is only if you want to add frosting.) Decorate. Frost or add sprinkles if desired. Heart-shaped sprinkles are ideal. Serve. Once the frosting has set, the cookies are ready for serving. Fruit Hearts Tray Cut the fruit into pieces about an inch thick. Use a sharp kitchen knife. Cut out heart shapes from the fruit pieces. Use a heart-shaped cookie cutter and press it down into the 1-inch-thick fruit. Place each heart piece made onto a plate, awaiting arrangement. Display. Organize the fruit hearts by color or scramble randomly. Serve. This is a great healthy Valentine's Day treat. Valentine's Day Trail Mix Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl.  Serve.
