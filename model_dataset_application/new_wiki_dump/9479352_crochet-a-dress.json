          "description":"The length of your chain is dependent upon the person who will wear the dress. You will be making the top part of the dress in 2 parts (front and back pieces), so measure for the front of the dress first. Use a t-shirt in the size that the person wears to determine how wide the chain will need to be. Make the chain long enough to go across the chest area of the t-shirt, just below the armpits. To crochet a chain, first make a slipknot. Loop the yarn around your fingers twice and pull the first loop through the second loop. Then, slide the slipknot onto your hook, and tighten it by tugging on the tail until it is snug around the hook. Then, loop your yarn over your hook and pull the yarn through the slipknot. This is your first chain. Keep yarning over and pulling through one to make more chains."

Continue to double crochet into each stitch in the chain until you reach the end of the chain. This will serve as your foundation row. Keep working rows until the top is the length you want it to be. After you complete the first row, chain 1 and then double crochet across the next row. Continue to work each row in the double crochet stitch until the front piece is the length you want it to be. You can make it just long enough to cover the chest, or you can make it long enough to cover the entire abdomen from chest to waist. Work the first 7 stitches in double crochet to form a strap. After you are satisfied with the length of the front piece, you will need to add the straps. Double crochet the first 7 stitches at the beginning of the row. Then, chain 1, turn your work, and double crochet across the 7 stitches. Keep working back and forth across the 7 stitches until the strap is the length you want it to be.

Keep going back and forth until the strap is the same length as the other one. Tie off and cut the yarn about 12 inches (30 cm) from the last stitch so that you have plenty of yarn for weaving the straps together. Create a second piece that is identical to the front piece. After you finish making the straps for the front piece, create another piece that is identical to the front piece. This will serve as your back piece. Chain the same number of stitches to start, and complete the straps in the same way as you did for the front piece. Connect the front and back at the straps. When you have finished making the back piece, thread one of the loose ends of yarn that is extending from one of the straps through a yarn needle. Then, match up your pieces so that the straps of the front and back pieces are aligned and use the needle to sew them together. Only sew along the tops of the straps. Do not sew down the sides! Repeat this for the matching straps on both sides of your dress top. Working the First Round of the Skirt Attach the yarn to the center point of your back piece. Next, you will begin working the skirt of your dress. To begin, attach your yarn to the center point of the bottom of your back piece. Create a slipknot and slide it onto your hook. Then, insert the hook through a stitch, yarn over and pull through the stitch and the slipknot. This will connect the yarn to your bottom piece and you can begin crocheting as usual from this point. Double crochet 1 time into the first stitch. Chain 1 to begin your row. Then, double crochet into the first stitch in the new row. This is the stitch directly beside the stitch you have anchored the yarn to. Double crochet 2 times into the next stitch. For the second stitch in your row, double crochet 2 times into the same stitch. Working 2 double crochet stitches into the same stitch space is also known as a V-stitch. Repeat this sequence to the end of the piece. After double crocheting twice into 1 stitch, double crochet 1 time into the next stitch. Keep repeating this sequence all the way to the end of the row, which will also bring you to the end of the piece. Join the front and back pieces with a double crochet stitch. When you reach the end of the piece, join the two pieces using a double crochet stitch. Line up the pieces so that their edges are even. Loop the yarn over your hook, and then insert the needle through the first stitch on the other piece. Yarn over again and then pull through the stitch. Yarn over again and pull through 2 stitches. Yarn over again and then pull through the last two stitches on your hook. This will secure the 2 pieces together on this side and also form the armhole for your dress. Continue alternating between 1 and 2 double crochet stitches. After you have connected the 2 pieces on 1 side, you will need to continue the alternating pattern of double crocheting 1 and then double crocheting 2. Repeat this all across the front piece, and then connect the front and back pieces with a double crochet stitch on the other end, just as you did with the first side. Connect the round with a slipstitch. Keep alternating between 1 and 2 double crochet stitches until you are back where you started. To connect the round, slipstitch into the first stitch that you made. Insert the hook through the stitch, and then yarn over and pull through the stitch and the loop on the hook. Working the Second Round of the Skirt Double crochet into first double crochet stitch. To start your third row, chain 1 and then double crochet into the first double crochet stitch in your row. Work a V-stitch into each V space. Next work a V-stitch into the first V-stitch space that you created in the previous row. This is the area between the 2 double crochet stitches that you worked into the same stitch. Work 2 double crochet stitches into the V-stitch space to create another V-stitch. Repeat the sequence all the way around. After you complete the V-stitch, start the sequence over by double crocheting 1 time into the next double crochet stitch in the row. Then, do another V-stitch into the next V-stitch space. Continue this pattern for the entire round. Connect the round with a slipstitch. When you get to the end of the round, connect the ends of the round with a slipstitch. Insert your hook into the top of the first stitch in the round, yarn over and then pull the yarn through both stitches. This will complete your second round. Repeat the round until the skirt is the desired length. To continue working on the skirt, keep repeating the second round. Alternate between double crocheting 1 stitch and making a V-stitch for the next round and every round after that. Keep going until the skirt is the length you want it to be. Tie off and cut the yarn. When your skirt is the desired length and you have completed your last round, tie off the last stitch. Then, cut the excess yarn a few inches away from the last stitch. Trim or weave in any loose ends. To avoid having any hanging pieces of yarn on your dress, you can either trim the loose pieces to about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the last stitch, or use a yarn needle to weave them into the inside of your dress.
