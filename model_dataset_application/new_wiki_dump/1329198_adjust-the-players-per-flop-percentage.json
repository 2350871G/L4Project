Conversely, if a couple of players simultaneously left a table, adjust the player/flop percentage higher. If a table had 10 players, you had a 1/10 probability of having the best hand, but with 8 players you have a 1/8 probability of having the best hand. Note: 1/10 and 1/8 are not accurate numbers and are presented here for your understanding. Using Poker Tracker, for a 10 player game, the pots won will average less than 10%. However, an exceptional player could have a 10% or higher win rate for a 10 player game."

By playing more hands, you will be in action more and have more opportunities to win pots. Give action to get action, you will have your share of good hands in time. It is a lot more fun to be in action, however, calculate whether it is profitable to play hands that are break-even or barely profitable when you include tipping the dealer. Play less starting hands if a player/flop percentage became smaller (the game is more tight). Playing tight, in this situation, will save you money.
