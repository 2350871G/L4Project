  "text":" Combine beef, pork, onions, beaten eggs, bread crumbs, 3 tablespoons water, parsley, paprika, prepared mustard and salt. Mix well. Press the mixture into the 8\" baking pan. Place the 3 hard cooked eggs in a row down the middle of the meat mixture, then fold up both sides, so you have a loaf. Preheat the oven to 375.  Dice half of the bacon. Set aside the remaining slices. Cook the diced bacon over medium heat in the large, oven safe pot. When all the fat is rendered, remove the bacon. You don't need the diced bacon, just the fat, so feel free to snack on it as you are cooking. Add the oil to the bacon fat. Increase heat to medium-high. Carefully place your loaf in the hot oil. Turn it every few minutes until it is browned all the way around. Place the reserved bacon strips on top of the loaf after it has browned. Then bake for around 45 minutes, basting often with the beef broth. Carefully remove loaf from the pot. Transfer to a serving dish. Transfer any juices left in the pot, as well as the remaining beef broth to a small saucepan. Heat over medium high heat. Combine the 1/2 cup water, and cornstarch and mix well. Stir into the pan juices and bring to a simmer until thickened. Remove from heat. Stir in sour cream, and pour over meat loaf just before serving. Finished. ",
