Placing the cover on a flat, sturdy surface and holding in place, grip the handsaw by the handle with your other hand and gently saw at a downward angle in smooth, even movements. Be sure to only apply pressure on the down-stroke."

The bubble should be in the center of the liquid when you hold the level vertically against the wall and look at it at eye-level. This is how you will know that the base will be straight.
