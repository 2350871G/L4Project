Applying masking tape along the edges of the area that you want to stain will also help you achieve clean and crisp lines.

You might have to use stronger cleaning products for more stubborn stains. Having a clean surface before starting the staining process is important to avoid any build up of old bacteria from affecting the new stain. Use a cloth or cleaning brush to scrub the tiles in a circular motion. Aim to remove as much debris as possible then wait for the tiles to dry before moving on to the next step."

Apply the primer in even coats using a roller brush, making smooth up and down strokes. Work through small sections at a time until you have covered the entire area. Allow 2 to 4 hours for the initial coat of primer to dry before applying another coat using the same procedure. Try to find a primer that also has protective properties for your ceramic tiles.
