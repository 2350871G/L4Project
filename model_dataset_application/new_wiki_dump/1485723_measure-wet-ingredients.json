  "text":" Using a Cup for Thin Liquids Start with a liquid measuring cup. Liquid measuring cups are the most accurate way to measure thin liquids, like water, milk, juice, and oils. They are made of transparent glass or plastic, and have markings on the sides to indicate volume in both metric and English units. You can find one at a grocery store, big-box store, kitchen-supply store, or even a dollar store. Place the cup on a flat surface.

If you\u2019re measuring less than a quarter cup of a thin liquid--for instance, vanilla extract--use a measuring spoon to dole it out. Hold the spoon over a separate bowl to catch any overflow, and gently pour in the liquid until it\u2019s full. Empty the spoon into the recipe, and continue.

This works really well with sticky ingredients like peanut butter and mayonnaise. Measuring by Weight Acquire a kitchen scale. Many European recipes use weight or mass instead of volume to measure, especially for baking. Statistically, measuring by mass produces more accurate results, so especially if you bake a ton, you may find a kitchen scale useful.They\u2019re easy to find in kitchen-supply shops and on Amazon. 1 cup of water weighs 8 ounces, or 240 grams. 1 teaspoon of water weighs .17 ounces or 5 grams, while 1 tablespoon weighs .529 ounces or 15 grams. Set a liquid measuring cup on the scale. This will help you more accurately eyeball how much liquid you need to add. If you don\u2019t have a liquid measuring cup, any sturdy (and preferably clear) container will do. Whichever vessel you choose, make sure it\u2019s centered on the scale. Set the scale to zero. This is called \u201ctaring\u201d or \u201czeroing.\u201d If you\u2019re using a mechanical scale, twist the knob on the side until the weight dial reads \u201c0.\u201d If you\u2019re using a digital scale, simply press \u201c0\u201d or \u201cAll Clear (AC).\u201d Either way, this step is crucial, as it takes out the weight of the container you\u2019re using.

If you add too much, you can spoon it out until it\u2019s at exactly the right weight. Mix liquids if applicable. If the recipe calls for milk and vanilla mixed together, you can measure them both by weight in the same cup! Measure out the first liquid, then tare the scale.
