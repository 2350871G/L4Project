Maybe you would like collecting old stamps or coins. Do you enjoy reading? Perhaps you would prefer to collect books. Are you a big traveler? Maybe maps are more your speed. Whatever you pick, make sure it\u2019s something you\u2019re passionate about. Other ideas of things you can collect include autographs, watches, wines, art, hats, figurines, cups, shot glasses, key-chains and postcards. If you like spending time outside, try making your collection nature-based. Consider collecting seashells, rocks or pebbles, fresh flowers, acorns or leaves. If you have inherited a small collection from a friend or family member, consider expanding on that."

Start by looking in online forums; collectors are often willing to trade for new items or to sell items they currently own. Ebay is a great place to look for pieces. You can pay outright for items, or bid slowly to try to get the best deal possible. The con to using Ebay is that you don\u2019t get to see the item in person before purchasing. Craigslist is a great option to buy pieces as well. You can search by your location, or if you\u2019re willing to travel a little further, you can expand your search to a nearby state. The added benefit of shopping on Craigslist is you get to see the item in person before committing to buying that item."

Try visiting Flea Markets in your area, as well as antique stores and thrift stores. On weekends, visit garage and estate sales. Finally, check online to see if there will be any collector shows happening in your area. Collector shows are great ways to meet people within your collection community, and possibly get a new piece out of the deal. When shopping at antique or thrift stores, make sure you dig through every item. The gold is often buried amongst the garbage. Arrive early at garage and estate sales; the best pieces tend to go early. Come back on Sunday, sometimes the owners of the sale will drop their prices to rid themselves of their inventory."

This will prevent you from wasting money, burning out and ending up with a lot of items you don\u2019t need or value. Consider only adding to your collection while on vacation. This way, you tie pieces of your collection to fun memories from your travels. Collect from experiences. Pick a collection that doesn\u2019t cost any money. Consider collecting matchbooks from restaurants or coasters from bars. Collect seashells from your beach vacations or rocks from cool hikes. Your collection doesn\u2019t have to be expensive to have personal value."

This will give you something to talk about when showing off your collection to others and will also make the collection experience more personal for you. When shopping for pieces, stock up on extras whenever you can. You can use these duplicates as leverage when trading with other collectors. Part of having a collection is refining it. Edit out old pieces you no longer care about to make room for new ones. Sell the old ones on Craigslist or Ebay, or take them to a pawnshop to have them appraised. Use the money you earn to add a new piece to your collection."

But don\u2019t just pile your entire collection inside; instead, try to tell a story using your collection.

If you collect books, try sorting your books based on color or size, rather than subject matter, for a more interesting aesthetic.

You can purchase specially designed plastic sheets that will make it easy to organize and store your pieces. The plastic sheeting will also make it easy for you to transport your collection and show it off to your friends. Try using tabs within the binders to organize your collection by category. If you are organizing baseball cards, those categories can be dictated by different positions, teams or years. You can also sort the collection according to what condition each card is in. Be careful to store your binders someplace safe and dry to keep your collection from warping or getting ruined."

Hang shadowboxes on the wall to show off your vase collection. Hang floating shelves to display some of your favorite hats from your hat collection. If items from your collection are easily broken, take care not to hang them anywhere dangerous. Update the items you are showcasing. As you buy new pieces, remove the old ones from your walls and replace them with the updated versions.
