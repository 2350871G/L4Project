      "description":"Any variety of hops can be used for aroma hopping; most likely, you will be brewing from a recipe kit that will specify what type and amount of hops you should use. If you are not brewing from a given recipe, note that you will often achieve a cleaner, clearer flavor when using only 1 type of aroma hops."

      "headline":"Prepare the hops for addition into the wort.",
      "description":"Whether you are using pellet hops or full-leaf hops, you will need a way to submerge them into and retrieve them from the boiling wort. The easiest method is to tie the hops into cheesecloth bags; many brewing supply stores sell \"hop bags\" designed specifically for this purpose."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Lower the aroma hops into the boiling wort.",
      "description":"Aroma hops should be added in the final 15 minutes of the boil or later. Adding them to the wort before this time will cause too many of the hops' volatile oils to evaporate, which will minimize the amount of aroma imparted. The time at which you add the aroma hops will be specified by your recipe (if using one). In general, the later you add the hops, the fainter but more nuanced the aroma and flavor imparted will be. Swirl the cheesecloth bag around a bit in the boiling wort to ensure that the hops are soaked through."

    {
      "headline":"Consider adding the aroma hops at knockout if desired.",
      "description":"Instead of adding the aroma hops late in the boil, you can actually add them \"at knockout,\" meaning at the point when you turn off your heat source. Doing this will preserve nearly all of the hops' volatile oils, but can also lend the beer a grassy flavor that may clash with the overall flavor profile."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Remove the aroma hops.",
      "description":"After turning off the heat (or allowing the hops to steep for a few minutes if added at knockout), remove the cheesecloth bags containing your bittering, flavoring, and aroma hops. You can now chill the wort and prepare to transfer it into your fermenting vessel."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Compost or discard the spent aroma hops.",
      "description":"If you brew beer regularly, you will generate a large amount of used hops. Because these hops are organic matter, they can be readily composted, which helps reduce pressure on landfills."
