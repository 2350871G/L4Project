In this case, since you're going to draw a replica of a pre-existing character, it's pertinent to find images of Selena. You can use online image-search engines, such as Google, Bing, Pinterest, etc. You want to see her from head-to-toe."

If you start off drawing her eyes, hair, or other details, you run the risk of proportional errors later on that may require lots of erasing and/or redrawing. The basic goal here is to start simplistic and slowly add more details as the image progresses. Draw a circle. This circle is going to eventually become Selena's head. Don't worry if it's not an exact circle or if the lines are sketchy. You're going to erase portions of this later, so keep the line-weight light."

Here, the scale bar is going to be Selena's head. However, all you have to do is image 6 of the image collage posted above. The following bullet points will merely explain how image 6 was conceived:\n1) The green circle is the reference to the circle that was made for the head. 2) Taking \"image three\" from the reference images of Selena, image 2 shows how the circle compares to her head. This reference image was picked because it was the best one found that showcased her full height. 3) Identical circles were added until her feet were reached. 4) Removing the background image, you should be able to see more clearly that a total of three circles (of the size of her head) is equivalent to her height. 5) For the sake of simplicity, remove the curve and--instead--stack the circles as you would a snowman. 6) Now that you've seen the relationship between her height and the drawing thus far, go ahead and draw two more circles as done in image 6. In this image, the circles are labelled as what will become the \"head\", \"torso\", and \"legs\". You're welcome to label them as well, though it's better not to since they'll get in the way later."

  "text":" Planning Your Drawing Find reference images. Just about every artist out there uses reference images when they draw. In this case, since you're going to draw a replica of a pre-existing character, it's pertinent to find images of Selena. You can use online image-search engines, such as Google, Bing, Pinterest, etc. You want to see her from head-to-toe. Simplify the image. In the end, you want Selena's body proportions to be correct according to her design. If you start off drawing her eyes, hair, or other details, you run the risk of proportional errors later on that may require lots of erasing and/or redrawing.

Extend the line on the left-side of the head so the it ends roughly above the other bangs. Draw a curve connecting the top of the left-side bang to the right-side without going through any of the other lines of the bangs. Draw the eyebrows and ear. Draw two thick dots above the eye-lids. Draw a slightly-thick curve from outside the periods. Draw a curve from the right-side of the head down to the top of her cheek. The top of the curve should be roughly the same height as the eyelashes. Draw the earring. Draw a line angled out from the bottom third of her ear. Draw a curve from the bottom of that line back to her jawline. Draw curve within this that doesn't touch the other part of the earring thus far. Connect the top stem of the earring and erase the part of the ear within the earring stem. Draw the hair bun. On the top-left side of her head, draw to line angled to the left. The should be roughly the same width apart as the eyelid. Draw a curved line connecting them. Draw the hair bun accessories. Draw two lines on the left-side of the bun. Draw two curves on the left-side of the lines. Draw two lines between the previous lines and the top of the head. Erase the part of the bun between every other one of these lines. Connect the right-side of these lines. Draw the nose. Draw a half-circle in the middle of the bottom have of her head. Draw a 'v' underneath the half-circle. Shade in the 'v' with hash marks. Draw the mouth. Draw two short lines half-way between the nose and chin. Draw periods at the top corners of the lines. Draw hair details. Feel free to skip this step if disinterested. If you do try it, the key is to make curve with a light line-weight. The curve should alternate from starting together or not. Examples of the line types are given next to her head. Drawing the Torso Begin drawing the torso and draw the neck. Draw two triangles: one taking up two-thirds of the top of the torso circle and the second taking up the bottom-third. The top triable should lie just underneath her chin. Draw two lines down from her jawline. They should be about the same width as her nose. Draw a curve connecting the two lines.

Draw a curve from the middle of the thumb and up past the top of her hand. Draw the shirt. From the shoulder-to-should, draw two parallel curves. The bottom curve should lie right above her chest. Draw similar curves on both arms and under her chest. Draw the necklace. Draw a long 'U' shape from her neck to the top of her chest. Draw another one outside of the 'U' shape, but keep the top of the 'U's close while the bottom of them have a larger gap between them. Draw a circle with another circle in it in the center or the two 'U' shapes. Add circles between the stem of the necklace and the bottom curve. Draw a curve above the bottom of her neck for her choker. Draw the bracelets. Draw a curve at her wrist. Add three more above it in order to create three bracelets. Draw the shirt loops and add her belly button. Add upside-down arches to the bottom of her sleeves and shirt. You can connect them to each other, have gaps between them, or alternate between the two. When you get toward the edge of her torso/arms, don't complete the arch. Just draw the arch until it gets to those lines and then stop. Add a tear drop slightly bellow her waist, but leave the top unconnected. Draw arches within the arches. Drawing the Legs Draw the sides of the pants. Draw lines from the hip and angling outwards. Try to keep them curved at the top. Follow the circle for guidance. The lines should stop close to the bottom of the circle, but a little short of it. Connect the bottom of the pants lines to the bottom of the circle. Draw the waist of the pants. Draw a wide and curvy 'V' that connects to the bottom of her hips. Draw another 'V' underneath. This completes her waistband. Draw the top belt. Draw arches under the waistband. Alter between having them connect and not connect with the other arches. All connect to the waistband. When you get toward the end of the pants, don't complete the arch if it means going past the line. Add arches inside the arches. Draw a longer arch underneath with an arch inside of it. Draw the lower belt. Draw curves from the longer arch to the middle of the outside line of the pants. Draw another arch underneath. Draw circles underneath this belt with a distance between each circle. Draw diamonds attached to the circles with diamonds inside of them. Draw the inner portion of the pants. Draw a from the center of the long arch to the bottom-center of her pants. Don't let it go all the way to the end of the circle. This line should be roughly the same distance as the outside pants. Have the lines be slightly angled to the left. Connect the center-pant-line to the right pant leg. Try to curve the bottom connection. Connect the bottom of the left pant leg to the center of the previous line. Draw the pants folds and decorative details. The key for the folds is to start with curves connected together at the bottom of the pant legs, have them curve away from one another, and then come close together again. Alternate from having them touch and not touch. Feel free to draw through the belt if you need to in order to keep the lines consistent.

Draw a 'v' past the length of the left foot. Connect the 'v' to the right pant leg. Draw the shoes. Draw the arches of the shoe ties and the arch of the heel on the left foot. Draw the bottom of the shoes aligned parallel to the left-foot and connect the two lines. Draw a curve about the bottom triangle of the right-foot. Draw the toes.
