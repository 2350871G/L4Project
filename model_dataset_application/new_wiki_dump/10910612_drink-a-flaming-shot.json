To be safe, make sure the area isn\u2019t too crowded. Count how many seconds the alcohol's been burning. Aim for no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, so the shot glass isn\u2019t too hot to hold."

Once the air\u2019s gone, the flame goes out and the glass should stick to your hand. Give the shot glass a few shakes to make sure the fire\u2019s out. Some shots have their own rituals, including how to suppress the blaze, so this method might not apply depending on your drink."

Plastic straws will likely be the easiest to find, but you\u2019ll need to drink quickly. The fire could melt the straw within seconds. Aim for a longer straw to guard your face further. You can try metal straws, which are harder to melt, but the heated straw could be a safety hazard. They\u2019ll also be harder to find when you\u2019re out."

As most modern flaming drinks are only lit on the surface, fully submerging the straw keeps you from directly swallowing the fire, protecting your mouth and throat."

Anticipate some lingering flames in the shot glass; there will be leftover alcohol present, which can keep the fire going. Keep an eye on the end of your straw, as it might have caught fire when placed in the shot. Follow up with water or beer to be sure you\u2019re in the clear."
