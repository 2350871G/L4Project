  "text":" Making the cupcakes Preheat the oven to 375\u02daF/190\u00baC. Line the paper cupcake cases on a baking tray (sheet) in readiness for use. Put the sugar in a mixing bowl. Half melt the butter and add it into the bowl (it is easier to mix when melted). Beat the ingredients until creamy.  Add the eggs. Beat again until the mixture is smooth. If you want to, try a bit to make sure it is not poisonous\u2013\u2013just not a whole spoonful, or the whole bowl! Sieve the flour into the bowl. Although you do not need to sieve the flour, it is best to do so as it helps to make the cakes fluffy. Stir. If you are using the suggested additional ingredients, now is the time to add the raisins, sultanas or chocolate chips. Transfer the mixture in the prepared paper cases.  Put the cupcakes in the oven. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Making and adding the icing In a small bowl, make the icing for one half of the cupcakes. Add the icing, sugar, water, and green food coloring. In another small bowl, do the same but use pink food coloring in it instead of green. Take the cupcakes out of the oven. Allow to cool. When cooled, ice the cakes. Add the green icing to 8 of the cupcakes and pink icing to the other 8 (if you are making 16 cupcakes). Divide evenly, depending on the amount of cupcakes. Decorate as preferred. For example, you could put dark chocolate sprinkles on Elphaba's cupcake and white and pink sugar glitter on G(a)linda's. Finished. ",
