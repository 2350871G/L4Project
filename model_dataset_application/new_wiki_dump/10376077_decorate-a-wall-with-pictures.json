For instance, you might use a row of 4-6 small to medium pictures to fill a wall instead of 1 large picture. For a small room, you might use just 1 or 2 small to medium pictures.

Additionally, you can easily mix photos and art prints. You could also choose a bold color to feature, keeping the rest of the colors neutral. For example, you might choose a series of pictures with a splash of blue amidst gray, black, and white."
