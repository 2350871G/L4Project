  "text":" Making the alpine wheel Tie the two ends of string to the pieces of wood. The string should be the length that you want the radius of the alpine wheel to be, from its center to one edge. This forms a simple compass, where one stick stays in the center while you pull out the other stick to make the string taut and walk around marking a circle, keeping the string taut at all times. Drop marker rocks or similar to define the circle as you go, or simply draw the circle in the dirt with a stick if the soil allows for this. Use the string compass to map out a circle for the alpine wheel.  Dig over the alpine wheel area. Add compost, fertilizer, etc., to improve the soil as you'd do normally. Depending on the plants you're adding, adjust the soil improvers as required. Place the circular object of choice at the center of the wheel.  Make the spokes. Divide the circle into 8 even divisions. Using the bricks, place them in lines from the center to the circle's edge. Push the bricks down about halfway into the soil, leaving a tiny edge to form a mini wall alongside each division. Complete the circle's edge. Place a ring of bricks around the outer edge of the circle to define its end. Again, only push about halfway down, leaving the rest sitting up above the soil. Adding plants Plant about three alpine plants per division, spaced evenly apart. Or, if you're adding herbs, plant as many as will be suitable for the amount of herbs you have. Go for variety, planting a different kind of plant in each division; it will look more interesting when it has grown. Fill the dirt in neatly around the newly planted plants. Pat down gently. Water as needed. Place gravel on each division. Take care not to tip gravel onto the actual plants. If wished, you can skip this step if you don't think it'll help the plants. Add pebble or rock features. Place interesting pebbles or rocks in and around the plants to add a final touch of interest to the alpine wheel. Don't overdo this; less is usually best. Admire the finished alpine wheel. Tend to it regularly to prevent weeds from taking over. Keep adequately watered.",
