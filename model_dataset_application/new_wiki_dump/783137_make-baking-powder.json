Pour 1-2 tablespoons (33-66 g) baking powder in with your laundry to help boost your detergent. Mix a little baking powder with hot water to create a paste and leave on dried food. It will work to remove the food from stoves, countertops, and dishes so that cleaning them down with a sponge afterwards is much easier. Clean your microwave. Mix 2-4 tablespoons (66-132 g) of baking powder with 1 cup (240 mL) of water and place the mixture in the microwave. Heat until the water boils, and allow time for it to cool in the microwave. Afterwards, it should be much easier to wipe down the interior of the microwave. Clean your dirty mop by soaking it in a mixture of warm water and baking soda. It will remove any unwanted odors from mold or mildew that may be trapped in the mop head. Clean your drains. Pour half a cup of baking soda and then half a cup of vinegar down your clogged drain. Let the solution sit for a few minutes, and then pour hot water down the drain to rinse."
