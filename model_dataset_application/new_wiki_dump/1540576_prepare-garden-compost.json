          "description":"Stationery compost bins are enclosed on all sides, have top access, and are open at the bottom, to be placed directly on the soil. Start by adding a few inches of dry, \"brown\" compost materials, which may include wood chips and shredded newspaper. Place a layer of \"green\" compost materials on top (e.g., vegetable peelings, grass clippings) and alternate layers of the two types of materials. Don't use any meat, bones, oils, or weeds in your compost. Use a pitchfork or other garden tools to rotate the compost materials every week or two to add oxygen and help the composting process. Water the compost regularly so it stays moist. The process should take a few months and should leave you with a dark, crumbly product that looks and smells like fresh soil."

Add your \"brown\" and \"green\" compost materials to the bin and turn it two to four times a week, giving it several good turns each time. Your compost should be ready in approximately a month, depending on the overall volume. To speed up the process, place your compost tumbler in a sunny spot.
