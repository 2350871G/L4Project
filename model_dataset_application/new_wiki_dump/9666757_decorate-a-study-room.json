You\u2019ll be more productive if you dedicate a space to studying rather than working in a room you use for other things, like your bedroom, living room or kitchen. This helps to minimize distractions and keep you on task. Use curtains or partitions to separate a study space from the rest of a larger room."

Then, you can move from the desk to the couch when you feel restless or want to sit in a different position. A chaise lounge piled with pillows and blankets makes a great reading spot or resting space."

Pick a desk that is large enough to accommodate all the materials you use frequently, like your computer and books. When you sit in the chair, the desk should be at a level between your rib cage and waist so you can comfortably rest your elbows on it. It\u2019s essential that the chair is the right height as well as comfortable to sit in for long periods of time, so take your time when picking it out. If you don\u2019t like working at a desk or table, you could choose a comfy couch or chair instead. You may want a lap desk to write on as well."

You can use natural light (like from a window) during the day, but make sure you have either an overhead light or lamps for studying after dark. If you use a lamp, focus the light on your desk or work space. A light or lamp that mimics natural sunlight is best, so use a cool white light bulb, rather than a warm yellow bulb. Avoid using colored light bulbs."
