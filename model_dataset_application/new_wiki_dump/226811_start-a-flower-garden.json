          "description":"You may already have an idea of where you want to grow flowers. However, you can't just start planting, as different plants need different amounts of light. You can simply observe your garden over the course of the day, checking on it every hour or so to see which areas get full sun (at least six hours of sunlight) and which areas are partially shaded. It can help to make a chart of the areas you'd like to plant, and then mark off \"partial\" or \"full\" for every hour you check on the areas. Keep in mind that you may have to perform maintenance including deadheading and separating flowers. Make sure to leave space between plants so that you have room to access them . Build your garden in small steps. Start with a small flower bed, say a patch that is 5 feet (1.5 m) by 5 feet (1.5 m) or less. A patch that size has room for around twenty to thirty plants with perhaps three types of annuals and one or two perennials. Put your garden in a noticeable area. If you plant your garden in a forgotten corner of your yard, you may very well forget it, meaning it could die off without you knowing. However, if you stick it someplace you can see it every day, you're more likely to be reminded to provide the care it needs."

          "description":"To plant flowers, clearing the sod first is essential, as it gives your flowers room to grow. Dig it out by using a shovel to get under the grass and roots and pull out the top layer of grass. For a less labor-intensive route, place newspapers all over the area (at least five layers thick). On top of the newspapers, lay out a covering of potting soil mixed with topsoil or compost. The soil covering should be at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick. Leave the covering on the ground and wait about four months. The sod will die off and the newspaper will become part of the soil."

The easiest way is to add compost, peat moss, or shredded leaves into the top 6 inches (15 cm) or so. Basically, most organic material will work. You can even use old manure. If you can't dig into the soil, you can leave the organic material on top, and after a few months, it will become a part of the soil."

You can buy a kit from a local garden store to make your raised garden, and then fill it with soil."

If it's fairly shady, you need to pick a flower that's going to be happy in that area. Also, consider how much work you want to put into your garden. That is, you can plant perennials that come back every year, but that don't bloom as much as annuals. With annuals, you need to plant them each year, but you'll get more colorful blooms that last longer. Also, make sure the flowers you want to grow are zoned for your area. You can look up your zone online or ask at a local nursery. Some perennials to try include daylilies, pansies, irises, lamb's-ears, black-eyed Susans, Russian sage, and roses. For annuals, try zinnias, marigolds, cosmos, and sunflowers. You can also mix and match annuals and perennials for the best of both worlds."

It goes under the containers, which can keep the soil warmer, promoting growth. If using a grow light, remember you shouldn't leave it on all the time.
