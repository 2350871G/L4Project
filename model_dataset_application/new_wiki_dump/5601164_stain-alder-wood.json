For deep stains that sanding doesn't cover you can use a chemical stripper:\nWork in a well-ventilated area, with eye and hand protection. Apply a thick coat of stripper over everything, letting sit according to the directions. Use a putty knife and steel wool to remove the stripper after the required time.
