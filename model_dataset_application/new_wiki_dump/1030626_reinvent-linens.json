Always look for designs and embellishments in particular, that are worth salvaging. The sorts of linens that are great to hang on to include:\nEmbroidered, crocheted, tatted, etc., doilies, mats, tablecloths, napkins/serviettes, tea cosies, toaster covers, table runners, etc. Anything embroidered has many opportunities for reuse! Old tea towels, both used and unused. Many people admit to having a tea towel that had such a pretty design that it was impossible to ever make use of it! Vintage and collectible linens. These will always have continued value in their own right but if you make a decision to honour the original maker's work, you can also do a lot with these items when reinventing them. Everyday items, including towels, hand towels, face washers, etc., can be found new uses when their old use expires."

      "description":"Old linens can make delightful gift wraps, especially when they feature a beautiful design and embellishments such as lace or ribbon. Finish off by tying the gift together with gorgeous grosgrain, velvet or satin ribbon, or any other leftover item suitable for tying it together. Wrap wine bottles in embroidered cloths. Wrap delicate and easily stained items in linen. Sew the linen into a distinctive gift bag."

      "headline":"Use linens to decorate paper craft projects.",
      "description":"Linens can be ideal for use on a variety of paper craft projects, especially to use up stained items. Simply cut out the prettier elements such as embroidery or embellished parts of stained linens, and put them to good reuse. Add linens to handmade cards. Use various types of fancy scissor cuts (pinking shears) to make the edges of the linen more exciting. Use linens to make gift tags. Let the linen help decide the shape of the tag. For example, if you are cutting out an animal motif from a linen, follow the shape of the animal for the tag. Turn linens into bookmarks. Find suitable parts of linen to cut into a bookmark size. Cover in plastic contact if wished, for added protection. Attach ribbon or braiding to finish off the bookmark."

Don't forget to reinvent old but beloved designs from pillow cases, sheets, quilt covers, and other bedding that is no longer used. Curtains and tablecloths can also be used to make quilt pieces."

Other embellishments can be added too; consider using items from your old button collection, or from stored lace, ribbons, and braids."

      "headline":"Turn linens into guest towels.",
      "description":"There are two possible methods here for reinventing your linens:\nAdd linens as an embellishment to a new towel. Select the decorative elements, cut to size and stitch onto the towel. Turn the old linen into a guest towel in its own right. Measure the linen against a guest towel and cut to size. Stitch down the edges to prevent fraying and add any embellishments if needed. Drying your hands on linen is a wonderful experience."

      "description":"If you have a beloved tea towel that has special memories, wonderful sayings, a gorgeous picture, etc., turning it into a wall hanging can be a fabulous way to keep it in the spotlight. Iron the tea towel flat. Place it on a backing board. Attach using tape or stitches. Make sure that it is taut. Build a frame around the edges. A framing store can cut to size if you can't do this alone. Nail frame into place. Attach a hanger at the back and hang on your wall."
