Pull one end past the other so that they overlap by about four inches (10 cm). The overlapping ends should lie parallel to one another. Double back the outer cord end. Bend the tip and bring it back along the outside of the loop. You don't need to do anything with the inner parallel end. Pinch the ends together to form a small loop. Hold the inner end of the cord together with the looped-back outer end. You should be holding three parallel \"layers\" of the cord at the thickest point. Make sure that you have plenty of extra cord at the outer end: you will use this to finish the knot. Pull the end of the cord with one hand, and pinch the loops together with the other.
