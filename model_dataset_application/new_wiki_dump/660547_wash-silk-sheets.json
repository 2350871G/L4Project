If you do not have a gentle detergent, you can wash your sheets with baby shampoo or a gentle adult shampoo. There are also detergents that are formulated for washing silk available as well. You can also ask the manufacturer or store where you purchased sheets to recommend a detergent for washing your sheets. Never use bleach or detergents containing bleach to wash your sheets.

Direct sunlight will damage the silk fiber and cause discoloration. You can also roll your sheets in a towel to remove excess water. You may have to use multiple towels to get all the water out. If you are unable to hang dry your sheets, lay them flat on a clean towel or bed to dry. Do not hang your sheets on a wooden rack to dry. Dyes and finishes used on the wood can stain your sheets."
