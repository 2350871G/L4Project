You can tell your partner how many tricks you know you can win, and how many others you have a chance of winning. Once you each disclose your winning potential, choose a combined bid and write it down. A \"trick\" is a round where each player puts down one card, and the player with the best card wins.

If you do not have a card of the same suit to play, discard a higher card from a different suit or play a spade. Discarding a card from a different suit will not win the trick. For example, if player 1 leads with the 7 of clubs, each other player, if possible, must put down a club this round."
