Show off your healthy sandwich by choosing rainbow swiss chard. It also tastes great and, like lettuce, can be used raw. Throw your ingredients inside, wrap and enjoy."

Chop off the stems of the portobello mushrooms, wash and then throw them on the grill with your burgers. You will need two mushrooms per burger."

Jicama tastes like a potato but is slightly sweeter and has more water. Wash and then peel the jicama. Slice it into quarter inch slices and replace each piece of bread with one slice of jicama. If you are making tacos, you could use Jicama instead of the tacos. Instead of slicing the jicama, scoop out the middle and then throw the taco ingredients in the middle."

Choose thicker condiments like tahini, as opposed to watery condiments like greek dressing."

Start by throwing in your protein. Next, choose a crunchy vegetable or seed such as shredded carrots, slivered almonds, sprouts, cucumber sticks or shredded carrots. Then, you will want something creamy such as yogurt or tahini. Finally, throw in something to boost the flavor a bit such as mustard or hot sauce. Finally, roll up the wrap like you would a burrito.
