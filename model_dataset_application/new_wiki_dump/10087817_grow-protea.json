Look for healthy green leaves and new growth when picking your proteas out. Container sizes that are anywhere from 4 inches (10 cm) to 1 gallon (3.8 L)  tend to be the best when it comes to survival rates. Plant the Proteas in autumn to avoid harsh weather. Avoid planting proteas in damp or super humid conditions."

If you don\u2019t have well-draining soil in your yard, you can purchase some at a local garden or home improvement store. To see if your soil is well-draining, dig a hole that\u2019s roughly 1 foot (30 cm) deep and fill it with water. Once the water drains, fill it again and use a ruler to see if roughly 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the water drains each hour. If so, it\u2019s well-draining. Plant the Proteas on a mound so that water doesn't build upon the soil. You can use completely new soil, or you can mix new soil in with your current soil as you dig the hole. If you are adding new soil, look for 1 that's slightly acidic, as protea prefers this type of soil. You can also amend your existing soil to make it more acidic."

If you\u2019re using the soil that\u2019s already in your yard, break it up with a shovel and set it to the side so that you can reuse it when covering up the root ball. Don't plant it too deep. Your soil line should be at the same height as it was in the container. Before you plant the protea, backfill the hole with amended soil that will provide proper drainage. When digging the hole, make sure that the height isn\u2019t too deep\u2014you don\u2019t want the plant\u2019s stem covered up.

Proteas like to receive air from all angles, making it important to spread them out when planting. Protea plants can grow to be anywhere from 3\u201313 feet (0.91\u20133.96 m), depending on the exact species.
