          "description":"Choose a container that is large enough to fit your wooden slice. Use plastic, fiberglass, or stainless steel since some materials, including other metals, could damage or discolor the wooden slice. Make sure the container is clean so there isn\u2019t any dirt or chemicals that could alter the appearance of the wood slice."

          "headline":"Place wooden slats on the bottom of the container to elevate the slices.",
          "description":"Put 2-3 small wooden pieces or slats on the bottom of the container so you can rest the center of your wooden slice on top of it so the underside isn\u2019t pressing against the bottom of the container. Try to use pieces or slats that are the same size so your wooden slice rests evenly on them.You could also use small bricks or smooth stones to support the wood slice."

          "headline":"Put on a pair of rubber gloves ot protect your hands.",
          "description":"Use a pair of well-fitting rubber gloves so you\u2019re able to open and pour the solutions without the risk of spilling or dropping them. Make sure there aren\u2019t any holes or tears in the gloves so your skin isn\u2019t exposed.Latex or thick rubber gloves will work fine. The solutions could make you ill if it\u2019s absorbed through your skin, so make sure you\u2019re protected and wash them with soap and water immediately if you get some on your hands."

          "description":"Pentacryl is a specially formulated wood stabilizer that\u2019s designed to keep green or fresh wood from cracking as it dries. If your wood slice was recently cut and hasn\u2019t had a chance to air-dry yet, fill your container with Pentacryl to soak your wood.Pour enough Pentacryl to fill your container about halfway to \u2154 full so it doesn\u2019t overflow when you add your wood slice. You can find Pentacryl at woodworking supply stores or by ordering it online."

          "description":"If your wooden slice was cut and left to dry for longer than a few days, use wood sealer as a soaking solution to help prevent cracks or splits from forming. Fill the container just over halfway so you can submerge the wooden slice without overflowing the container.Wood sealers that are commonly used to prevent wooden slices from cracking as they dry include Wood Juice and Anchorseal. You can find quality wood sealers at woodworking supply stores, at hardware stores, or by ordering it online."

          "description":"Denatured alcohol, also known as wood alcohol, is pure ethanol with additives that make it toxic to consume. Thin wood slices soaked in denatured alcohol will dry without shrinking so quickly that cracks form. Fill your container just over halfway full with denatured alcohol so you can soak the slice without the liquid spilling over the sides.Be careful not to breathe in the fumes of the alcohol when you add it to the container. Look for denatured alcohol at home improvement stores, at department stores, or online to order."

Place a stone, rock, or brick on top of it so it doesn\u2019t float. Wrap a layer of plastic wrap over the top of the container to keep the solution from evaporating and to help it soak into the wood.The slice doesn\u2019t need to be fully submerged in the solution to soak it up. As long as more than half of the slice is submerged, the wood will absorb the solution. Use standard plastic wrap to cover the container."

          "description":"Leave the wood slice in the container to soak undisturbed. As a general rule of thumb, give it a solid day for each 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the thickness of the slice so the solution can penetrate deep into the heart of the wood.For thin slices in alcohol, let the wood soak for at least a day. Avoid checking on the slice or disturbing it so the solution can soak into the wood evenly."

Lean the slice against a wall or prop it up on its side in a warm, well-ventilated location such as a garage, basement, or shed. Let it dry for up to a week so the solution can evaporate and the wood can dry without cracking.Thinner slices can dry in just a few days, but slices that are thicker than 5 inches (13 cm) could take up to a month. If the surface of the wood is moist or damp at all to the touch, then it isn\u2019t dry yet.Tip: Tape cardboard to the side of the slice or bury it in wood shavings to speed up the drying process."

The salt paste will draw the moisture out of the slice and keep it from shrinking too quickly and cracking. After about a week, check the wood to see if it\u2019s fully dried.
