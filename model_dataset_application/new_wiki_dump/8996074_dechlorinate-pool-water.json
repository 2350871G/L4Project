The most common chemical for dechlorination is sulfur dioxide, although carbon absorption, sodium metabisulfite, and hydrogen peroxide are also used for this purpose.

Vitamin C does not remove oxygen from the water and is not toxic to aquatic life. Whereas sulphur-based products remove oxygen from water and are toxic to fish, vitamin C-based dechlorinators, such as Vita-D-Chlor, are aligned with the EPA\u2019s Clean Water Act. They are safe to handle and easy to dissolve. Vitamin C-based dechlorinators are more expensive than sulphur-based products."

The most accurate way of measuring chlorine concentrations is through a DPD (N-Diethylparaphenylenediamine) test, although test strips or a colorimeter can also be used. DPD test kits use a comparator. A comparator allows you to compare your sample to color standards. You put your sample in the slot and then compare the color to the standards on the side of the instrument. A colorimeter is an instrument that uses white light to determine chlorine levels. It is a separate instrument, which won\u2019t be included in standard DPD test kits. Test strips can also be used to determine chlorine levels. They are the simplest and cheapest option."
