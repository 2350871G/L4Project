If you see crisscrossing beams, your home has tresses that make the work much more expensive. Trusses are more common and can prevent you from being able to raise a roof. If your home has attic space, you may be able to elevate the ceiling without touching the roof. It typically involves removing horizontal beams called joists and installing a new ceiling. If you don\u2019t have sufficient space above the room, then a contractor has to raise the roof in order to elevate the ceiling. They make the surrounding walls taller, often by adding taller support beams."

You won\u2019t be able to see where they are inside the walls, but you may be able to trace their general route from the exposed parts. Plastic pipes are much easier to reroute than metal ones. They can be cut and extended as needed to fit the new design. Most duct systems can be moved the same way. If you have metal pipes or ducts in an inconvenient spot, they increase the project\u2019s price. Metal components often have to be routed underneath your home."

Look for any visible wires near the ceiling, but also, locate any spots where they appear to cross through the ceiling. Complicated wiring systems could make the project much more difficult and expensive to complete. In most cases, removing the wiring is routine. It can be taken out and then reinstalled after the ceiling has been raised.

Look for online reviews and recommendations from other customers before choosing a contractor. Also, vet contractors by asking for their credentials and experience with raising ceilings.

It usually means making a triangular-shaped ceiling with the highest point in the middle, although you could also ask for a curved ceiling. It takes advantage of available attic space and requires new support beams to be installed. The result is a tall, broad ceiling that makes a room look much bigger. The work can be extensive, so a vaulted ceiling isn\u2019t possible in all homes. The shape and height of the ceiling also makes cleaning and maintaining the room a little harder."

It doesn\u2019t require as much work as a vaulted ceiling, so it\u2019s often less expensive to create. It leads to a simple but versatile design that can make any room look a little grander. Tray ceilings fit well in rooms designed to impress guests, such as entryways and dining rooms. Tray ceilings don\u2019t add as much space as vaulted ceilings.

Think of a checkerboard where the squares made by support beams on the ceiling are elevated. The additional material used to create the coffered design causes the ceiling to be a little lower than normal. However, it can also cause rooms to feel a little cozier. Coffered ceilings are great in rooms where you don\u2019t necessarily need the highest ceiling possible to feel comfortable. Your living room or kitchen are a couple of good options. Coffered ceilings often require less work than tray ceilings to construct. However, the total price is often the same due to the amount of material used."

Molding can be a good feature to add some class to walls or keep dust out of the corners. However, it often isn\u2019t a necessity. It\u2019s also easy to pry off the walls and replace."

Keep the ceiling white or at least a lighter color than the walls. Avoid darker colors most of the time, since the visual weight they carry will make the room look darker and more enclosed. If you have a raised ceiling, such as a coffered design, you could try using dark colors. For example, paint the coffered part a dark gray, then paint the surrounding trim white. Another option is to vary the wall colors to take advantage of vertical space. For example, paint vertical stripes or extend the ceiling paint down over the top of the wall.
