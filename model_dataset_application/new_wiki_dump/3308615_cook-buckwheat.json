Toasting brings out the flavor of the buckwheat and gives it a nutty aroma. Toasted buckwheat is referred to as kasha. If your buckwheat has already been toasted, you don\u2019t have to toast it again. Raw buckwheat doesn\u2019t smell, and is a light brown or greenish color instead of golden brown."
