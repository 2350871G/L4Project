It may seem impossible to keep calm during an emergency, but there are a few things you can do to remain level-headed. Focus on your breath. Count to three while breathing in, hold your breath to the count of three, then exhale to the count of three. You can (and should) do this while moving to safety, but controlling your breath can help you from hyperventilating or making rash decisions."

Announce to everyone else around you that you believe there is an active shooter situation, and that everyone needs to get out or hide."

Training and preparation can help you escape to safety, but remember to always have a backup plan. If you can't follow your primary plan, evaluate whether or not you can follow your backup plan."

However, experts advise that hiding should only be an option if you cannot safely escape. If you know of an escape route that will keep you at a safe distance from the shooter, resist the urge to freeze up and force yourself to run, as long as you can do so safely."

If there are possible positions along the route where the shooter could potentially ambush you or others, recognize this, and anticipate how you would respond if that were to happen. Most shooters aim at arbitrary targets. The harder you are to see and hit, the safer you will be, so try to be rational and avoid entering into the shooter's line of sight. If you're in the vicinity of the shooter, try to find an escape route that gives you both concealment (to stay out of view of the shooter) and cover (to protect you from bullets)."

Don't stick around to watch or figure out what is going on, but put as much distance between you and the shooter; this will make it difficult for the shooter to shoot you and reduces the chance that you'll be shot by random fire. Note that this is only possible if the shooter has not noticed you, if you're lost in a crowd, or if you hear gunshots from a distance but have not yet seen the shooter. If you can help others without endangering yourself, try to do so. Try to escape even if others insist on staying. Encourage the other people you pass to leave with you. However, if others are uncertain about running, don't wait for them to decide. It's important that you get out first and foremost."

Ideally, your hiding place should not trap you and make you a \"sitting duck.\" An ideal hiding place should have adequate space for you to move and escape if you need to. Be quick in deciding where to hide. Try to secure a place to hide as soon as you can.

In addition, if the shooter comes across you in this position, he may assume you're already dead. Laying low to the ground also reduces your chance of being shot by a stray bullet. Keep away from the door. Some shooters will just shoot through a locked door, rather than try to enter it or break it down.

You could hold the object in front of your body to deflect the shots or throw it at the shooter. Scissors or letter openers can be used as a knife. Even a pen could be used as a weapon, particularly since you give it leverage with the back of your thumb. If there is a fire extinguisher nearby, grab it.

Whatever you do, it's important that you act fast and focus on disarming or incapacitating the shooter. If the shooter has a rifle, grab the barrel and turn it away from you while striking or kicking him at the same time. The shooter will likely try to get control of the weapon back, but if you follow his movement he may be caught off guard and get thrown off balance. If you can get the butt end of the rifle as well, then you'll have both ends and can use the weapon as leverage to further kick, knee, or push the assailant. If the shooter has a pistol, try to grab it by the barrel from the top, so that he cannot point it at you. With many models, grabbing the pistol from the top keeps the gun from cycling properly, so while the already chambered round WILL FIRE, the next round won't be chambered without manually racking the slide. Try to aim high when attempting to bring down the shooter. His hands and the weapon are the most dangerous parts of him during a shooting. Otherwise, try for the eyes, face, shoulder and neck."
