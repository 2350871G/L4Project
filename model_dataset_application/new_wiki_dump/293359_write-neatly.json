          "description":"All you need is a piece of paper and either a pen or a pencil \u2014 it seems simple enough, right? However, poor quality materials can make a significant impact on the legibility of your writing. The page should be smooth \u2014 not rough enough to catch the tip of your pen and create snags in the line of your letters, and not so smooth that the tip of your pen goes sliding about without your control. Use lined paper sized appropriately for your comfort level \u2014 wide-ruled if you write large letters, college-ruled if you write small letters. Note that in many professional contexts, adults are expected to write within the limits of college-ruled paper, but feel free to use wide-ruled if you are still young and in school. Experiment with different types of pens to see which one works best for you. There are several styles, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. Fountain pens use liquid ink and have a flexible writing tip that allows for stylized, better handwriting. While it delivers a beautiful line, a good fountain pen can be pricey, and it takes a good deal of practice to perfect the fountain pen technique. Ballpoint pens use a paste ink which some find unappealing compared to liquid ink; however, they can be extremely inexpensive. Note that you\u2019ll get what you pay for with ballpoint pens \u2014 a cheap pen will deliver poor handwriting, so it may be worth it to spend a little extra money. Rollerball pens have a \u201cball\u201d delivery system much like a ballpoint pen, but many people prefer them because they use the higher quality liquid rather than paste ink. However, they don\u2019t last as long as ballpoint pens do. The gel ink used in gel ink pens is thicker than liquid ink and results in a smooth feel and line that many people enjoy. Gel ink pens come in a wide variety of colors but can dry out quickly. Fiber tip pens use a felt tip to deliver ink, and many writers enjoy their distinctive feel when drawn against a page \u2014 smooth, but with a little friction or resistance. Because the ink dries quickly, these pens are a good option for left-handed writers whose hands smudge their words from left to right."

If the table is too low, people have a tendency to slump down and round their spines, which can result in chronic pain and injury. If it\u2019s too high, people carry their shoulders higher than is comfortable, resulting in neck and shoulder pain. Sit at a table that allows you to bend your elbows at approximately a 90-degree angle when writing."

Sit in your chair with both feet flat on the ground. Sit up straight, keeping your back and neck as straight as possible. You can take breaks from time to time if the posture is difficult, but over time, the muscles will develop and allow you to maintain good posture for extended periods. Instead of dipping your head down to look at the page while you\u2019re writing, keep your head as straight as possible while casting your eyes down. This will still result in a slight dip of the head, but it should not be hanging down toward the page."

Clench your writing hand into a gentle fist and hold the position for thirty seconds. Then spread your fingers wide and stretch them for thirty seconds. Repeat four to five times. Bend your fingers down so the tip of each one touches the base of each finger joint where it meets the palm. Hold for 30 seconds, then release. Repeat four to five times.

Proper writing technique engages muscles all the way from the fingers up to the shoulder and results in a smooth movement of the pen across the page rather than the start-and-stop motion often found with \u201cdrawing\u201d writers. Your fingers should act more as guides than as the force behind your writing. Focus on the following:\nDon\u2019t write using your fingers alone; you should engage the forearm and shoulders as well. Don\u2019t pick up your hand to move it every few words; you should be using your whole arm to move your hand smoothly across the page as you write. Keep your wrist as stable as possible. Your forearms should move, your fingers should guide the pen into different shapes, but your wrist should not flex very much."

On the next line of the page, write a row of circles, trying to keep them as even and round as possible. Practice the proper technique on your lines and circles for 5-10 minutes every day until you see in your pen control. Focus on keeping your lines the same length and at the same angle. Circles should have uniform roundness across the board, be the same size, and should close cleanly. At first, your lines and circles may seem sloppy. Your lines may be of varying lengths, they may not all be drawn at the same angle, etc. Some of your circles may be perfectly round, while others are more oblong. Some may close neatly, while others may have an overlapping hang-off where the pen mark ends. Even though this activity seems simple, don\u2019t be discouraged if your lines and circles are sloppy at first. Keep working at it for short periods of time on a regular basis, and you will see a distinct improvement with practice.

Just as you did in the previous section, you should move on to actual words, sentences, and paragraphs once you have grown comfortable with the individual letters. Use the same pangrams you practiced on with your print handwriting. Move your pen slowly but surely. With print handwriting, you lift the pen after every letter or a couple of letters, depending on your personal style. However, with cursive, you will have to write many letters before you can lift your pen. This can cause problems in terms of fluidity of penmanship. You may be tempted to rest your hand after every letter or two. Not only does this interrupt the flow of the word, but it can also result in inkblots if you are using a fountain or other liquid ink pen. Write as slowly and deliberately as necessary to make sure you don\u2019t have to rest your pen in the middle of a word. The cursive script should progress through a word at an even, smooth pace.",
