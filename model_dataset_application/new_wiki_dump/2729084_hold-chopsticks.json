          "description":"Use whichever hand you\u2019re more coordinated with to pluck the chopsticks up from the table, with the back of your hand facing you. Place your non-dominant hand beneath the tip end of the chopsticks and squeeze them together gently. This will line them up so that they\u2019re perfectly parallel with one another. On a standard table setting, your chopsticks will be lying side-by-side in front of you at a horizontal angle. It\u2019s usually easiest to pick up your chopsticks using your first 2 or 3 fingers and thumb. Be careful not to let the chopsticks clack together loudly as you pick them up. Doing so might be considered rude in quiet eateries and more formal settings."

          "description":"Use your non-dominant hand to steady the chopsticks as you adjust the placement of your dominant hand. Hold both chopsticks together in the crook between the base of your thumb and index finger until you\u2019re ready to dig in. If you\u2019re not sure exactly where to place your hand, align the top of the chopsticks with the tip of your thumb, then turn your hand over and grip the point nearest to the base of your thumb. Having your hand too high or too low on the chopsticks will make it harder to manipulate them properly.Tip: Always hold your chopsticks with the wide upper end facing outward and the narrow, tapered end facing inward."

          "headline":"Rest the lower chopstick across the base of your thumb and ring finger.",
          "description":"Arrange your first chopstick so that the upper part is nestled in the crevice between your thumb and forefinger and the tip end is lying against the inner edge of your ring finger. Once you\u2019ve got this chopstick where you want it, avoid moving or adjusting it. Some native chopstick users prefer to place their bottom chopstick a little higher up on the hand, right around the base of the forefinger. When used correctly, the bottom chopstick should remain stationary, allowing the top chopstick to do all the work."

          "description":"Now, take the second chopstick and shift it between the top first knuckles of your index and middle fingers. Brace the inner edge of the chopstick with the pad of your thumb. Make sure both chopsticks are pointing in the same direction, with the tips and top ends evenly aligned. This hand position should feel similar to the one that most people use to hold a pencil."

          "description":"Use the top of your thumb as a fulcrum for the upper chopstick, providing just enough counter-pressure for it to rotate against. The base is there to cradle the lower chopstick and nothing more. Attempting to incorporate your thumb into the movement will just make you more likely to trip yourself up. It\u2019s also important to keep your thumb straight, rather than allowing it to bend at the knuckle. Making sure your thumb stays put may seem complicated, but in reality, it gives you one less thing to worry about and lets you focus your attention on working the chopsticks open and closed."

If you\u2019re having trouble picking up food this way, try adjusting your grip slightly so that the pad of your middle finger is bracing the bottom chopstick on the opposite side of your thumb. Only the tips of the chopsticks should move. The tops should stay where they are, or come slightly closer to each other without actually touching.Tip: To get a better grasp (no pun intended) of the action used to open and close chopsticks, it can be helpful to imagine that you\u2019re making air quotes with your hand."

The further up or down your chopsticks slide, the more difficult it will become to use them. Hold your chopsticks securely, but don\u2019t squeeze them. This will just tire out your hand and cause your technique to deteriorate. Wooden and bamboo chopsticks tend to be better for beginners, since they offer a little more traction against your hand and one another."

As you raise the bite to your mouth, concentrate on pressing down lightly on the upper chopstick. This will keep the food pinned between the top and bottom chopsticks, ensuring that it doesn't go anywhere. Like anything else, becoming proficient with chopsticks just takes practice. Try moving foods of various shapes, sizes, and textures from one bowl to another slowly. This fun exercise will help you get the fundamentals down. Remember, the bottom chopstick is just there to provide support from beneath. The top chopstick is the one that should be doing all of the work."

Keep in mind that this alternative \"cutting\" method will only work on softer varieties of food. Traditional Asian dishes typically contain meats, vegetables, and grains that have already been reduced to a size suitable for chopsticks. Certain foods like tempura and whole fish, however, may need to be broken up in order to be made more manageable. In casual dining settings, it's also usually acceptable to take bites off of large pieces of food rather than tearing or cutting them."

If there are no chopstick rests handy, rest your chopsticks on the sleeve they came in or position them neatly along the left edge of your dish.

This should go without saying, but it\u2019s also a pretty big no-no to drum on the table, conduct an invisible symphony, imitate a walrus, or act out a mock sword fight with your chopsticks.

That way, you won\u2019t have touched everyone else\u2019s food with utensils that have been in your mouth. Another blunder to watch out for while serving yourself is digging around in the serving dish for the best looking pieces or your favorite ingredients. That\u2019s just selfish. Sticking your chopsticks in a communal dish is unsanitary, as it increases the risk of cross-contamination, but it may also come across as disrespectful if your fellow diners don\u2019t know that you aren\u2019t aware of the rule."

If you need to pass or relocate an especially large, heavy, or cumbersome dish, play it safe and set your chopsticks down so you can use both hands.
