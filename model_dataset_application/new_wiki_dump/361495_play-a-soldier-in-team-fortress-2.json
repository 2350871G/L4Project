An enemy is less likely to dodge a rocket attack if you shoot it at their feet.

It provides adequate power that can chip away at enemy health to help deliver a finishing rocket blow or pick off retreating enemies with low health.

Enemies on elevated ground are also valid shotgun targets, because your rockets can't be aimed at the ground in front of them to deal damage.

To Rocket-jump, you need to jump, then shoot and crouch at the same time. You should be in the air in no time. Remember that this will injure you. It is sometimes a good idea, if you have the time, to get a nearby medic to buff you up to 150% health to lower the health lost."
