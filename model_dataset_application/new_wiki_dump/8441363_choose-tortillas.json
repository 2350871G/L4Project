If the expiration date is soon\u2014or if the tortillas have already expired\u2014put them back and search for another package, whose expiration date is farther off. It goes without saying that if a package of tortillas is moldy, or if the tortillas are clearly stale, you should not purchase it. If you find that you\u2019ve already purchased a moldy, stale, or expired bag of tortillas, you should be able to take it back to the store where you purchased it, and receive a full refund or store credit."

Corn tortillas generally have a great shelf life than their flour counterparts, so if the longevity of the unused tortillas matters, corn may be the more economic option. As a rule of thumb:\nCorn tortillas generally last up to 10 days after the \u201cbest by\u201d date if stored in a pantry, up to 8 weeks after the \u201cbest by\u201d date if stored in the refrigerator, and up to 8 months after the \u201cbest by\u201d date if stored in the freezer. Flour tortillas can last up to seven days after the \u201cbest by\u201d date if stored in a pantry, up to four weeks after the \u201cbest by\u201d date if stored in the refrigerator, and up to eight months after the \u201cbest by\u201d date if stored in the freezer."

To decide which you prefer, you could compare two or three in a single sitting, or try a variety of brands over time. Popular tortilla brands include: Mission, Don Marcos, Pi\u00f1ata, and Cruz. If you\u2019re dissatisfied with the tortilla offerings at large chain grocery stores, you\u2019ll be able to find a greater variety of tortilla brands if you look at a health food store or an organic retail store. If you\u2019d like to find more authentic tortillas than those sold in large chain grocery stores, look online to see if there is a farmer\u2019s market or Mexican grocery store in your area."

          "description":"Flour tortillas are typically larger than their corn-based counterparts, and are consequently used for burritos, as they\u2019re able to hold more meat, cheese, and beans, without bursting open. Conversely, corn tortillas are often used for soft tacos, which are folded, but not wrapped shut, and almost always used to make enchiladas, in which the tortillas are layered atop one another. The consistency of the tortillas also plays a role. Flour tortillas are smoother and more flexible, while corn tortillas have a slightly grainy texture and can be brittle. When corn tortillas become stale, they can be fried and used as tortilla chips, or used to make taquitos."

          "description":"Corn tortillas are made from corn, which is a whole grain. Whole grains provide many nutritional benefits, including high amounts of fiber and various vitamins and minerals. Flour tortillas\u2014made from flour, which is a refined and processed grain\u2014do not provide these benefits.

Flour tortillas have a soft texture and a sweet taste, which tends to be mild. Corn tortillas have a more chewy texture, and also have a more pronounced flavor of roasted corn. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the differences in their flavor, buy a package of corn tortillas and a package of flour tortillas at your local grocery store."

Check your local grocery store\u2014or a health food store\u2014for spinach tortillas. Many commercial brands also offer whole grain tortillas or wheat flour tortillas. Whole grain tortillas are healthier options than generic white flour tortillas, as they\u2019ll contain more healthy nutrients. While spinach tortillas have an appealing taste, they do not offer substantially more health benefits than regular flour tortillas. Spinach tortillas are typically made from white flour, and spinach powder and green food dye are added to them."
