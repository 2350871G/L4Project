For example, a wedding-themed table may include fancy dishes that focus around the wedding cake, while a Halloween-themed dessert table might include kitschy desserts like a faux graveyard made out of crumbled brownies and gummy worms. Match your theme to the occasion, such a birthday, wedding, or holiday. Christmas parties might have a present theme, winter theme, or Santa\u2019s workshop theme. A birthday party could have a pastel theme, superhero theme, or candy theme. A wedding could have a rustic theme, polished theme, or DIY theme."

Most people base their color scheme off of the type of event or whom the party is for. For example, holidays have traditional colors that you could draw from, and birthdays often reflect the favorite colors of the person having the birthday. You might include a variety of pastel colors for a birthday or Easter-egg party. A dessert table for a wedding might incorporate your wedding colors. A Halloween dessert table might feature colors like orange and black or purple, green, and black. A Christmas dessert table might be red and green, or you could opt for winter white."
