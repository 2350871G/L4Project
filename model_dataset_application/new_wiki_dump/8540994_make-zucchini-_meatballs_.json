Use a medium or fine grater to reduce the zucchini to small shreds, allowing it to collect on top of the towel. There are lots of beneficial nutrients in the zucchini peels, so leave them on. 3 medium-sized zucchini should be enough to make a little over a dozen meatballs."

Zucchini naturally has a high water content, which can ruin the flavor and texture of the finished meatballs."

Blend the ingredients until they\u2019re distributed throughout the mixture. Together, the egg, breadcrumbs and cheese will serve as a binding agent to help the meatballs retain their shape. Crush the garlic cloves using a manual press, or pulse it in the food processor along with the basil to save time."

Make sure each meatball has been pressed firmly to ensure that they\u2019ll hold together while cooking. The meatballs will shrink somewhat as they cook. If you find that your meatballs are falling apart, add a small amount of flour to the mixture and try again. The flour will soak up moisture and become slightly sticky."
