This sends the cloves flying. If there's no wall stopping the cloves from falling off, instead slice off the top of the head and pull the cloves apart. You can use this method for as many heads at once as you can fit loosely into the containers."

Lightweight metal bowls are sturdy and easy to shake, but you can use any material. It's the cloves themselves that break apart each other's skin during the shaking. You can use cups, jars, light saucepans, a cocktail shaker, or any other sturdy containers that are easy to grip \u2014 and easy to clean afterward."

Smack the knife blade firmly with the heel of your hand. The clove will now be slightly smashed and easily separated from its skin. Now you can mince the garlic or crush it into a paste. If you don't have a wide knife, place the heel of your hand over the clove and press firmly."

Hold the garlic clove with the flatter end against your thumb, with your forefinger hooked over the pointy end. Pinch your fingers together to bend the clove, splitting the skin. Tug the skin off in one piece. This works best for cloves with papery skin."

You can use a silicone or rubber mat instead, rolling it into a tube yourself. This saves on kitchen space since they double as jar openers or non-slip surfaces."

Some chefs dislike using kitchen space on a one-purpose tool, but these can save a lot of time if you don't have the knife skills of a ninja. Try these tricks to clean the skin out of your press afterward."
