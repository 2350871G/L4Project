The court is divided into two sides, one for each player, that should evenly divide the pole in half. Your goal when playing tetherball is to hit the ball with your hand in a way that gets it past your opponent so that the rope winds completely around the tetherball pole."

If the ball hits the pole and returns to a player, the player may hit the ball again as though it were his first hit. Hitting the ball more than once is often called \"juggling.\" Each time the ball passes the boundary line or bounces off the pole, the hit counter is reset to zero.

These rules might be slight variations on rules you are already familiar with, but by asking for the house rules up front, you'll prevent yourself from getting an unnecessary penalty."

This includes the number of wraps; wraps around the pole gained from violations should be unwound. Additionally:\nPossession of the ball goes to the player who did not break the rules. This player should then serve the ball. Three rule violations results in an immediate loss for the rule breaking player.

Both players then drop the ball and after the ball hits the pole, game play resumes."
