          "description":"Whatever other home-security steps you may take will be of little use if a burglar can walk straight in through the front door. Many robbers only enter homes when they find that a door is unlocked, in fact; most burglaries simply happen due to doors and windows being left unlocked. To prevent this, lock all external doors (front, back and side) at all times, even when you're home or are going for a short walk around the block. If you have a balcony door, never leave it unlocked at night or when going out. Balconies could provide easy access to burglars. Garage doors provide access into your home, so treat them as any other door. Make sure they are locked properly, as well as the door that leads from the inside of the garage into your house."

If a thief finds that your front door is secured, they'll likely move on and try to enter your home through a window. Deter them by keeping windows locked at all times. If you're concerned about the security of your sliding glass door, drop a dowel or metal rod into the track on the inside. This will supplement the sliding door's lock (which is often weak)."

          "description":"Well-lit entrances are an effective deterrent, as burglars will be looking for houses that they can enter with no likelihood of being seen. It will be harder for a thief to break in if there are lights placed at entry points to your house. Install lights near all exterior entrances. If you\u2019re concerned about your house being broken into while you\u2019re away overnight, install motion-activated floodlights in your front and back yards. Alternatively, you can set a timer on your indoor lighting to make your home appear occupied."

Keep curtains closed in rooms with expensive equipment that could give burglars a peek into your home.

Thieves will check these locations first, and could gain easy access to your home. If you're concerned about accidentally locking yourself out of your home, give a spare key or two to a trusted neighbor, relative or friend. If you need to keep a spare key, then store it in a drop box set to unlock when either your phone is in range or you entered the correct security code. Another option would be to secure your door with an electronic lock instead of a manual one. Then, you wouldn\u2019t need to worry about a key and could unlock your door with a code. Of course, avoid obvious combinations, like 1-2-3-4."

Thieves who believe a house is inhabited will think twice before breaking in. If you\u2019re going to be away for a longer period of time and don\u2019t want to leave the lights on (say, for two weeks), you can put interior lights or your TV on timers.

Giving your home the appearance of being occupied means the thief will move on to easier pickings. Thieves are generally lazy they try to make the easy money in the easy way.
