  "text":" Cleaning and Preparing the Sorrel Immerse the sorrel in warm water. Wash the sediment and dirt from your sorrel by immersing it in a tub of water. Run your fingers across the leaves to wash them before removing them from the water. Pat the sorrel dry with paper towels. Press down on the sorrel with paper towels and try to absorb as much moisture as you can. Fold the sorrel in half. Folding the sorrel in half makes it easier for you to cut both sides of the stem. Cut the stem out of the bottom of each leaf. With the sorrel leaf folded, make an angled cut to take off the hard stem of the sorrel. The cut should run about two-thirds up the stem of each leaf.
