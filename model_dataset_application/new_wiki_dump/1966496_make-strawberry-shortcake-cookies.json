  "text":" Prepare the Ganache Add the white chocolate and the heavy cream to a double boiler.  Stir the ingredients continuously with a whisk until the chocolate has melted. Do not allow the cream to boil. Stir in 3 tablespoons of strawberry juice. Add an additional tablespoon if the ganache needs to be thinner. Cover the bowl with the ganache with plastic wrap and chill it in the refrigerator for 3 hours. The ganache will set but will not be hard. Bake the Cookies Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Combine the strawberries, lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of sugar in a medium bowl.  Whisk together the flour, baking powder, kosher salt and remaining sugar in a mixing bowl until the ingredients are well combined.  Add the chopped butter pieces to the dry ingredients and cut them into the mixture with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles large, coarse crumbs. Alternatively, you can mix the butter into the dry ingredients using your clean hands, but make sure you do this quickly so that the heat from your hands doesn\u2019t melt the butter. Stir in the heavy cream with a large wooden spoon, just until the dough begins to come together.  Fold in the strawberry mixture using a flat plastic spatula.  Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, scoop the dough onto the baking sheet, leaving about 1-1/2\u201d (4 cm) around each cookie.  Sprinkle the cookies with sanding sugar.  Bake the cookies until they are golden brown, which will take about 24 to 25 minutes.  Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the stovetop for 2 minutes.  Remove the cookies from the baking sheet with a spatula and transfer them to wire racks so that they can cool thoroughly.  Assemble the Cookie Sandwiches Take the ganache out of the fridge and whip the mixture with a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a whisk attachment.  Transfer the whipped ganache into a pastry bag with a medium-size round tip. Alternatively, you can put the ganache in a resealable plastic bag and cut a small hole in one corner of the bag. Place half of the cooled cookies facedown on the wire rack.  Squeeze the bag of ganache over each cookie half to put a generous dollop into the center of each upturned cookie.  Top the ganache covered cookies with the rest of the cookies, pressing the bottom of the cookie into the ganache.  Finished. ",
