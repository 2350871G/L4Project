          "description":"Gauge refers to the thickness of a wire, and the higher the number, the thinner the wire. 30 and 28-gauge wires are very thin, so they are great for making rings, stringing seed beads, and making small chains. You can even knit and crochet with this type of wire. Use jewelry making tools with very fine tips if you select a wire in one of these gauges."

You can also use this wire to wrap small beads and stones or to create small headpins. You may also knit and crochet with this wire. Select jewelry making tools with fine tips to work with this type of wire."

        {
          "headline":"Go with 24-gauge (0.51 mm) wire for most beading projects.",
          "description":"This gauge fits through most beads and it isn't too bulky, so it works well for stringing beads, such as for a necklace or bracelet. You can also use it to wire-wrap small beads, crystals, stones, and pearls, or to add intricate details to your jewelry, such as coils. Regular jewelry-making tools are fine for working with this type of wire. Wire in this gauge has a tendency to get kinks, so you may want to buy a wire-straightening tool."

          "description":"This is a medium-thin gauge wire, so it works well for wire-wrapping more delicate beads and crystals. Try using this type of wire if you want to wire wrap something small and delicate, such as a small crystal or stone. Use regular jewelry-making tools with this wire.Tip: Always check to see if the wire you want to use will fit through a bead before you start working with it. Insert the end of the wire through each of the beads you\u2019ll be stringing. If the wire won\u2019t fit through one of them, choose a smaller gauge."

          "description":"This is a medium-sized wire that is easier to work with than thicker gauges, but it holds its structure well. You can use it to make ear wires, small wire clasps, and headpins. It\u2019s also good for wire-wrapping beads and stones. However, since this is a thicker wire, it\u2019s unlikely to fit through most beads. Use regular jewelry-making tools when working with this wire."

It holds its structure well, so you can also use it to create structured details on jewelry and to wire-wrap larger stones and beads. Use regular jewelry-making tools when working with this wire."

This wire may also work well for wire-wrapping larger stones and beads. Use heavy-duty tools when working with wires in these gauges."

You can string beads with it, wire-wrap stones and beads, create ear-wires, or add accents to your jewelry. This is also a great choice if you are new to jewelry-making since round wire is often easier to manipulate."

          "headline":"Try half-round wire for ring shanks and binding bundles of wire.",
          "description":"Half round wire is flat on one side and round on the other side, so it\u2019s great for projects that would benefit from a flat side on the wire, such as bundling and creating rings. Don\u2019t use this wire if you need to string beads with it as it may not fit through some beads. Keep this wire straight as you work with it. Twisting it will turn the flat side out, which may look messy or unappealing."

This is an easy way to create a modern-looking piece of jewelry. Try making a pair of square-shaped earrings or a square-shaped bangle with square wire.Tip: Note that wire-wrapping a bead or stone with square wire may be more challenging, so you may want to practice with round wire first."

        {
          "headline":"Select twisted wire for an intricate or antique look.",
          "description":"You can purchase wire that consists of 2 or more twisted or braided strands. This type of wire works well for wire-wrapping stones and beads. It\u2019s also great for creating accents on your jewelry. If you want to string beads with this type of wire, check to ensure that the beads will fir through it first as twisted wire tends to be thicker. Tiger tail wire is a very common twisted wire in jewelry making. It is a braided stainless steel wire that is coated in nylon. It is very strong and comes in a number of colors. It cannot be used for wire wrapping, but it can be used to give the look of an \"invisible\" setting, where the beads look like they are floating."

        {
          "headline":"Choose memory wire for making bangles and structured loops.",
          "description":"Memory wire is made from carbon steel or stainless steel. It is great for bangles or other loops because it returns to the loop it was made into in the factory. However, it won\u2019t work for any projects that require wrapping. This type of wire is best for creating accents and forming structured shapes for your jewelry. You can find memory wire in round and flat types and in many different finishes, such as silver, gold, yellow gold, and brass."

          "headline":"Go with French wire to secure beads and add accents.",
          "description":"French wire is a coiled wire that comes in copper, gold-plated, silver-plated, sterling silver, and vermeil. The smaller the coil, the more precious the metal, and the more expensive it is. However, you often only need a small amount to accent your jewelry with French wire. Do not pull on the wire as this will undo the coil and ruin the wire."

You can purchase copper, aluminum, or niobium wire that is coated with a colored enamel. You can find wire in every color from gold to red to black to orange! The color won\u2019t fade over time, either."

          "description":"Sterling silver and gold wires are more expensive than color-coated wires, but they may hold up better and allow you to create a more luxurious looking piece of jewelry. This is also a good option for anyone who has a sensitivity to other types of metals. Gold-filled wire has 100 times more gold in it than gold-plated wire. This is an expensive wire, so reserve it for special projects. Warning: You may want to stay away from jewelry wire containing nickel. It often causes an allergic reaction. The average colored craft wire is nickel-plated, so be aware of this before choosing it."

          "description":"The patina is the natural color change that takes place in the metal over time, such as how a penny changes from bright and shiny to matte and brown over time. If you like the look of copper as it ages, then making your item from uncoated copper wire may be a good choice. The copper wire will start out shiny and gradually change as it ages. If you want to keep the wire shiny, choose a copper color-coated wire instead.Tip: To choose a wire finish, hold the wire next to the beads, stones, crystals, or other items you want to incorporate into the piece to see what looks best."
