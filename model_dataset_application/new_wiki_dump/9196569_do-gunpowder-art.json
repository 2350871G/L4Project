Small grain powder creates the effect without creating a large fire. There is not a particular brand that you need to buy, just avoid getting coarse grain powder as a beginner."

This is optional, but it works best for beginners. This helps you spread the gunpowder precisely on the artwork surface. It makes the process easier and allows for greater detail."

If you must work indoors, do it in a garage or shop with a concrete floor and ventilation. It\u2019s best not to do this inside your house or in another place that\u2019s a fire hazard. If it is windy or rainy, you won\u2019t be able to keep the gunpowder in the shape you want on the artwork surface."

Be as detailed as you want, depending on what you want to create. If the opening of the condiment bottle is too small, cut a bit off to widen it. If you don\u2019t use a bottle with a nozzle, pour the gunpowder out of its container or scoop some out with a spoon and spread it around."

A sponge brush works well because it allows you to push the grains around into detailed shapes. Even if you don\u2019t want to make a specific picture, brushes give you greater ability to shape the gunpowder than sprinkling it gives you."

          "headline":"Make designs with rocks, boards, or pieces of metal.",
          "description":"Set objects on top of the gunpowder to affect the explosions when you light it. Place objects around the gunpowder so the fire burns the outline of the objects. Experiment with different rocks and pieces of wood to create unique designs. For example, spread the gunpowder in a thin, even layer across the whole canvas. Set a dozen small stones around the canvas on top of the powder to change how it burns. Spread the gunpowder and set a few wrenches on top of it to burn the wrench shapes into the canvas. Any object that won\u2019t catch fire easily is fair game to add to the artwork. Be creative and experiment to find what makes the coolest designs."

          "headline":"Use a fuse so you have time to move back.",

Lay it so it touches the gunpowder and extends off of the base. It\u2019s okay to light the gunpowder directly, but you may not feel comfortable doing this. A fuse also adds a neat effect when it burns the artwork."

          "description":"If you use a fuse, simply light the end that extends off of the artwork. If you choose to light the gunpowder directly, light it at a corner or edge of the design. This is the best way to allow the fire to spread across the artwork."

          "description":"As soon as you light the gunpowder or fuse, step back three feet or more from the artwork. In case a bit of the gunpowder pops, you don\u2019t want to be close. You also want to avoid breathing the smoke directly into your nose and mouth."

          "description":"When all of the gunpowder is burned up, it will most likely leave some particles. Shake the excess into the trash, scrape it off, or use a vacuum wand to clean it off. If you like the way it looks and it\u2019s burned on, leave it as part of the artwork."
