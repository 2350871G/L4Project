Basically it is all the middle section of your rope. Understand the turn. The turn is when the end of the rope \u2013 the tag end \u2013 passes completely around the standing line. Some call this a wrap. Tying the Fisherman's Knot Grab hold of both ends of the rope. The end in your left hand is end 2, and the end in your right hand is end 1.
