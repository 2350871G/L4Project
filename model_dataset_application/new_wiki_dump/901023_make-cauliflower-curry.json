The tomatoes can be diced and will be cooked down, so don\u2019t worry about cutting them into uniform size; however, chop your onion into bite-sized pieces. If your eyes begin to water and burn when chopping onions, cut the onion under running water. Cutting onions under water prevents the sulfuric compounds from rising up and irritating your eyes."

Next, microwave the cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl with water for three minutes. After you have microwaved both vegetables, pour the water down the drain and place them together in a single container. Microwaves can be finicky. Watch your food closely to be sure that you don\u2019t overcook the potato or cauliflower. An alternative to using a microwave is to steam the cauliflower and potatoes. Simply add both vegetables into a steamer, cover, and steam for 3-4 minutes."

Next, add your tomatoes and cook for another three minutes. Be sure to keep stirring the mixture to prevent anything from burning. If you like a creamier curry, add \u00bc cup (60 ml) of coconut milk or yogurt. Mix in the coconut milk until the color is even. If you accidently add too much, allow the mixture to cook down over heat until the correct consistency is achieved."

Once these spices are powdered like a conventional dried spice, add them to the sauted onions, garlic and ginger. Stir the onion mixture for a minute or until they too are fragrant. Garam masala is a spice blend traditionally used in curry. While it can be made at home, it contains ten varieties of spices. It is often less troublesome and expensive to purchase it premixed."

Increase your heat until the mixture is boiling. When searching for chickpeas, look in the canned vegetable aisle of your local grocery store. One can of chickpeas is approximately 15 ounces, or just under two cups. If you choose to use canned chickpeas, always rinse and drain well."

Every so often, give it a stir but allow it to cook for at least 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, uncover the curry and allow steam to boil off. Allowing steam to boil off thickens your mixture. Thicken the curry to your preference. Before serving your curry, add salt and pepper to your liking. You can also pour the curry over rice and use diced cilantro as a bright garnish."
