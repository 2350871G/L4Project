This was the proper way to address invitations to married couples for a long time, so use it if you\u2019re going for a more traditional or old-fashioned style. Write \u201cMr. and Mrs.\u201d followed by the husband\u2019s full name. Include the middle name if you know it, or leave it out if you don\u2019t. For example, if the married couple was Thomas and Jane Smith, the invitation would read, \u201cMr. and Mrs. Thomas Smith.\u201d If you know that Thomas\u2019 middle name is Joseph, then the full address would be \u201cMr. and Mrs. Thomas Joseph Smith.\u201d\nRemember that this is a bit old-fashioned, and some women may oppose having their name grouped in with their husband\u2019s. Adjust your approach based on whether you prefer to be modern or traditional."

Precede each partner with \u201cMr.\u201d or \u201cMrs.\u201d, then list their full name. For example, \u201cMr. Alejandro Hernandez and Mrs. Tatiana Hernandez.\u201d\nTo save room, it\u2019s also acceptable to list them as \u201cMr. Alejandro and Mrs. Tatiana Hernandez.\u201d\nThis also covers the possibility that the husband and wife have different last names, which is growing more common. Simply list each partner separately with their full title. Some brides hyphenate their last name to keep their maiden name but include their husband\u2019s name as well.
