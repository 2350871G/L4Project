  "text":" Learn How to Sleep Your Yo-Yo Let out the slack in the yo-yo. Performing \"rock the baby\" will require you to be able to keep a yo-yo \"sleeping\" - spinning in place at the end of its string - for a few seconds. The first step in this process is to throw the yo-yo down and let the string extend fully. Keep your hand still after throwing the yo-yo. Allow the yo-yo to spin in place. Once the string is fully extended, the yo-yo will have plenty of rotational inertia and will begin spinning in place or \"sleeping.\" Keep your hand still during this time to avoid jerking the yo-yo and causing it to wind up again. Return the yo-yo to your hand. After letting the yo-yo sleep for a few seconds, jerk your hand lightly upward and then down again. As the yo-yo moves upward and your hand returns to its original position, slack will be created in the string that will cause the string to begin winding around the yo-yo's bearing. If it has enough inertia, it will return to your hand. Practice \"Rock the Baby\" in Slow Motion Let out the slack in the yo-yo. The first step in \"rock the baby\" is simply letting out the slack in the string. Allow the yo-yo to reach its full extension. Normally when performing this trick you would allow the yo-yo to sleep during the entire trick, but to learn the trick it is best to let the yo-yo stop spinning and practice the motions with a stationary yo-yo. Grab the string with your free hand. Once the yo-yo is sleeping at full extension, wrap all 4 fingers of your free hand around the string at about the midpoint of its length. Pinch the string with your yo-yo hand. Keep holding the string with your free hand and move your yo-yo hand downward, pinching the string about 3 inches (8 cm) above the yo-yo. Use your thumb and pointer finger to pinch the string. It helps to lift the entire string upwards with your free hand to make room for this maneuver. Make a triangle with the yo-yo string. To make the triangle, begin lowering your free hand and raising your yo-yo hand, while keeping the string pinched at the same spot.

Do this by gently moving your yo-yo hand towards and away from your body. Allow the yo-yo to sway back and forth 2 or 3 times. At full speed, you would allow the spinning yo-yo to return to your hand at this point. Perform \"Rock the Baby\" at Full Speed Let out the slack in the yo-yo. When performing the trick at full speed, you will go through the same motions you practiced at a low speed. This time, allow the yo-yo to begin sleeping at the end of the string so that it will maintain the inertia needed to return to your hand at the end of the trick. Perform the motions of \"rock the baby\" as you did in slow motion. When performing the trick at full speed, you will need to go through the motions swiftly and smoothly to keep the yo-yo spinning. When you begin swaying the yo-yo back and forth in the triangle, you can visually gauge how much time you have for swaying  before the yo-yo runs out of inertia. Return the yo-yo to your hand. To finish the trick, simply let the string go with both your hands. Allow the yo-yo to drop and jerk your yo-yo hand slightly to wind the yo-yo back up, just as you would with any trick. Note that if your yo-yo stops spinning during the trick, you will not be able to return it to your hand.",
