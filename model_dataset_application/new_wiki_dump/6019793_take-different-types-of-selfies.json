Your arms will create a frame in the photo, balancing it out and making it look more professional. Just make sure you don't cover the lens with either of your hands -- hold your phone as close to edge as possible."

Feet selfies can help you show off new shoes or get a new perspective on things. For example, kick your feet up on the seat in front of you (as long as no one's sitting there!) at a ball game, and use the field as a background."

Gyms have tons of mirrors, so use it to take your selfie. Make sure you're wearing good workout clothes - not just baggy sweats and a t-shirt with a bunch of holes in it. Stand under good lighting, especially since this will show off new muscles you've developed because they create shadow. Decide if you want to take your selfie before your workout -- when you look fresh -- or after when it's clear how much you've been sweating."

Float on your back in the water, with your camera pointed directly down. You can keep your eyes open or close them, but keep your face natural. Pose in whatever way feels natural while you're in the water."

Aim for having the sun in front of you, to the left or right. If it's straight in front of you, you'll be squinting in your photo. If you\u2019re inside, face a window. You can also hold a plain, white piece of paper under your face while you take the selfie. The natural light will bounce off the white paper and illuminate your face, which can help reduce the look of a double chin. Aim for taking your selfie at sunrise or sunset. The light isn\u2019t direct and is much warmer and much softer. It also reduces the likelihood you\u2019ll end up with shadows on your face."

Just make sure you don't cover the lens with either of your hands -- hold your phone as close to edge as possible. Choose a bathroom selfie if you're looking for good light.

Taking a Group Selfie Use the timer on your phone. You don\u2019t want to take a selfie with a huge group of friends only to find out one person wasn\u2019t ready. Instead, set the timer on your phone and let your friends know how much time they have to get in position. Angle the camera way up. To get more than one or two people in a shot, you\u2019ll need to get your phone as far away from your face as possible. Hold your phone with your arm extended all the way out, holding it above you and your group of friends. If you have a selfie stick, use it the same way. Make sure everyone is facing the light. If you\u2019re in a big group, it\u2019s going to be hard for everyone to find their light. If you\u2019re outside, make sure everyone is facing the sun (although not directly).

As long as the wall still looks white, you don\u2019t have to worry about anyone\u2019s skin looking too red or too blue. Direct the selfie and take a few options. Make sure you count down for your friends so they know when the photo is being taken. Tell them you\u2019ll take a few different pictures, and shout out the poses you should go for: silly, serious, sexy, whatever you like!",
