Working cat programs will use a group of feral or stray cats to hunt pests, such as rats and mice. If you get a group of stray cats to live in the place you want to tackle the pest problem, the pests will smell the cats and find another place to live. If you live in Chicago, you should look into the program run by Tree House Humane Society. If you live in New York City, you should look into the New York City Feral Cat Initiative. If you live in Texas, call Barn Cats Incorporated."
