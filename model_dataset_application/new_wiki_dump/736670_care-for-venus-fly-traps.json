          "description":"Venus fly traps have relatively long roots, so they prefer pots that have vertical depth. In general, a pot that gives your plant 4 or 5 inches (10cm) of root growth space should be good. Pick an insulated pot. Their roots are also sensitive to temperature change, so an insulated pot works best. While plastic pots do work, you should definitely consider searching your local garden center for insulated pots. Pick a pot that will filter and absorb nutrients and salts that would otherwise harm your fly trap. An unglazed terracotta pot is a porous container that will let your roots breathe oxygen through the soil and act like a sediment filter for the water. Having said all this, Venus fly traps are not terribly picky about their pots. You can use a deep terracotta pot with a hole in the bottom or a bucket with some holes cut in the bottom of it for drainage."

          "description":"Mix equal parts of sphagnum peat moss and perlite. Never use beach sand, which contains nutrient salts. Perlite is a form of hydrated obsidian that looks like small chunks of white sand. Perlite helps potted plants retain moisture. Native to the bogs and swamp-lands of North and South Carolina, Venus fly traps enjoy high humidity and moist, poor, acidic soil. The ideal pH  for a Venus fly trap is in the acidic range of 4.9 to 5.3 (most normal plants and vegetables prefer a more neutral range of pH 5.8 to 7.2). Another mixture combination that is preferred by some fly trap growers is five parts sphagnum peat moss, three parts silica sand, and two parts perlite. Silica sand helps with aeration; is known to help plants develop a resistance to warmer temperatures and pests, and both silica sand (which is quartz) and perlite do not release excessive nutrients and minerals into the soil, which is good for your carnivorous plant. Do not use regular or organic potting soil, as this sort of soil will kill the plant by burning its roots. You should also stay away from fertilizing your fly trap, as fertilizer may also \"burn the roots,\" thus killing your plant. Do not use any enriched soil, like Miracle-Grow, as it contains fertilizer and highly organic compost."

There are three ways to water your plant, each with their own benefits:\n\nThe Tray Method: The tray method of watering is one of the best watering methods for an actively growing plant that is in direct sunlight. Your plant should be in a pot that has drainage holes in the bottom. Place the pot in a tray that is filled with water. Your plant\u2019s growing medium will absorb the water like a wick, giving your plant all of the water it needs & increasing humidity around the pot. Keep in mind, however, that if your pot is relatively shallow (5 inches or 13 cm) this method could be detrimental to your plant because the plant\u2019s roots could be too surrounded by water, causing fungal or bacterial growth. The Top Method: This is how most plants are watered, you pour or spray water onto the soil around the plant and let the water drain out of the bottom of the pot. Your plant\u2019s soil should always be moist but not soaked. This means watering your plant two to five times per month during the growing period. The Double pot Method: This is the most effective method for growing fly traps; The second pot surrounding the smaller terracotta pot in the middle isolates the plant from drastic temperature changes, increases humidity in the air, and retains moisture. Only pour water into the second pot on the outside diameter of the middle pot. The porous terracotta pot in the middle should allow moisture to enter the middle of the pot and filter out extra nutrient salts."

The soil should become much drier (though never fully dry). The soil directly around the base and roots should be slightly damp, while the rest of the soil is dry. Water the plant like you would any other time, making sure to water thoroughly. When you do water your plant, water it in the morning so that it has the whole day to dry out a bit before the cooler night temperatures come in.

When Venus flytraps are outdoors, they catch insects, grasshoppers (and occasionally small animals like frogs) that provide nutrients that will make the plant healthier. Keep in mind that the trap sometimes doesn\u2019t seal unless the item it has caught is moving. This means that you should feed your fly trap live prey like flies and mealworms. A helpful tip when using live prey is to put the prey in the freezer for a few minutes so that it becomes very slow. You should only feed one or two of your plants traps at a time, and only when the plant is healthy and strong. If you do decide to feed your plant a dead insect, you should place the insect in the trap and then gently rub the trap every 20 or 30 minutes until the trap seals fully. Rubbing the trap makes it think that the thing it has caught is moving. This is not always necessary, however, as the plants also use chemical receptors to close with the presence of nutrients inside the trap. Do not feed your plant \u2018exotic\u2019 food like bits of hamburger or cake. This will more than likely kill the plant, particularly if you give your plant meat, as the plant will have a negative reaction to the fat.

As the leaves turn brown, they should begin to weaken and detach from the plant. Most of the time, you should be able to just pluck them off the plant. For the tougher ones, sewing scissors work well. You should also be aware that Venus fly trap leaves tend to die off in bunches. Re-pot your plant. If you notice that you plant looks like it is too crowded in its pot, that it has divided into two (or more) plants, or that it dries out too quickly, it is time to re-pot your plant. Doing this is much the same as potting your plant in its original container. Make sure to use the right composition of soil (see Part One). Try not to touch your plant's traps. Triggering your plants to close when there is nothing in their traps for them to \u2018eat\u2019 is an unnecessary waste of energy for your plant. It takes two to three weeks for a plant's trap to reopen and again be ready to trap its potential food. While it is OK to gently rub the outside of the traps after you have fed it an insect, you should limit the amount you touch your plant. Never put anything inside their traps except for insects.",
