You\u2019ll also be able to see 2 arms that are stretched above the torso. The arms and legs will be made up of stars strung along in relatively straight lines. The legs of Hercules are made up of at least 4 stars, with 2 being at the knees of Hercules and the others where his feet would be. The string of stars that make up the right arm is longer than those that make up the left."
