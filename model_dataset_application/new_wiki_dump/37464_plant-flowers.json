Will it become very large and bushy, or stay relatively small? Will it grow upwards and become tall or outwards like a vine? Ask about native flowers before looking at all the available varieties. Flowers indigenous to your area are already known to be successful growers in your soil, temperature, and humidity zones. Check to see if the flower you are growing is an annual or a perennial. Annuals bloom only once a year and must be replanted yearly, but are known for their bright colors and beautiful blossoms. Perennials grow back every year without needing to be replanted and will continue to grow larger over time. Read the tag for the watering requirements for the flowers.
