  "text":" Rolled felt beads Place the graph paper on a work surface. Measure a rectangle on the paper using the dimensions of 12 x 10cm (5 x 4\"). Measure another rectangle on the paper using the dimensions of 12 x 8cm (5 x 3\"). Cut these rectangles out. They are now your templates for cutting out the felt pieces. Pin the paper templates to the felt sheets. Use a different color of felt for each rectangle. Always pin from the corners, to make the most of the felt sheet. The colors must be complementary. Cut out the felt rectangles. Follow the guidance of the template. Align the smaller felt rectangle on top of the larger felt rectangle. Match the long sides but on the shorter sides, leave a gap at each end. Spread glue along one of the two gaps, at the end. Roll the felt into a tube shape. Begin at the side you have placed glue on and simply roll up as firmly as possible. Just before reaching the other side, squeeze some glue across the gap edge. Hold the roll with your other hand, to prevent it from unraveling. Complete the roll and hold the glued portion in place with rubber bands for a short while, until it adheres properly and the roll won't unravel.
