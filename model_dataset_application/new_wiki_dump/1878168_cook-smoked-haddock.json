You can use one large sheet for all of the fillets or you may decide to use separate pieces of foil or parchment for each of the fillets. Either way, the foil or parchment should be about twice the size of the filet(s) it will be covering. Season the haddock.

Serve your fish with at least 2 vegetables or one vegetable and one starch to create a balanced, healthy meal. For a distinctly British twist, serve with several slices of black pudding. Pan-Frying Smoked Haddock Heat a frying pan. Bring a wide frying pan to temperature over a medium-high flame, then reduce to medium heat to avoid burning. Add some oil to the pan.

You may want to drizzle with some lemon juice, or top with a quick lemon-caper sauce. Serve with at least 2 vegetables or one vegetable and one starch to create a balanced, healthy meal. Making Smoked Haddock in Mustard Sauce Prepare some potatoes. Cut red potatoes (or other potatoes of your choosing) into medium-sized chunks, then steam, boil, or roast them until they are soft. Divide the potatoes onto several plates. Small fingerling or heirloom potatoes may not need to be cut. Poach the smoked haddock. See \u201cPoaching Smoked Haddock\u201d above for details. After the haddock has cooked, remove the haddock from the milk and place a haddock filet on top of each plate of cooked potatoes. Drain the poaching milk from the pan. Keep the milk, but strain it to remove any chunks of seasoning or fish. Melt two pads of butter. In the same pan that the fish cooked in, melt some butter over medium-high heat. Then add a bit of flour (roughly the same amount of flour and butter), and stir together well, allowing the butter and flour to cook for 2-4 minutes. Pour the milk into the mixture. Slowly pour the strained poaching milk into the flour and butter mixture, stirring well as you pour. Continue adding milk until the sauce is the desired thickness. You can adjust the thickness of the sauce by adding additional milk to thin or adding flour to thicken the sauce. Be aware that the sauce should thicken slightly as it cools as well. Add the mustard. Stir about 1 tbsp of mustard into the sauce, stirring well to combine. Other spices, such as fresh tarragon, may be added at this time as well. Pour the sauce over the haddock and potatoes. The sauce should be piping hot and will re-warm the potatoes and haddock. After pouring the sauce over the fish, the meal is complete, and should be served immediately. If you are concerned about the fish and the potatoes being cold, you could add them to the pan and toss them in the sauce over the heat, but be careful not to damage the fish fillets (they will taste great, but may not look as pretty if they are broken up while tossing in the sauce). You can top with a bit of parsley for a nice presentation. Consider some modifications. You may also want to add other vegetables to this method. You can place a bed of spinach between the potatoes and the haddock, or you can serve the haddock on a bed of peas in lieu of potatoes. It is also common to place a poached egg on top of each haddock filet before pouring the sauce over the meal.",
