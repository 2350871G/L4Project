Most people drink caffeine for one or both of those reasons, but too much caffeine can do serious damage to your system. If you\u2019re constantly sipping on your caffeinated drink of choice, it\u2019s probably time to slow down and help your body return to a more normal state. Up to 400 mg a day is ok, but any more is too much. 400 mg of caffeine is equal to the amount in 4 cups of coffee or 10 cans of soda. However, it is not safe to drink 10 cans of soda in one day. This is only an example to show how much caffeine it contains."
