Expert Answer\t\t\t\t\t\tQ\t\t\t\tWhen asked, \u201cDo rug pads damage hardwood floors?\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSam Adams\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFull Service Contractor & Owner, Cherry Design + Build\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSam Adams is the owner of Cherry Design + Build, a residential design and construction firm, which has been operating in the Greater Seattle Area for over 13 years. A former architect, Sam is now a full-service contractor, specializing in residential remodels and additions. EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tSam Adams, design firm owner, responded: \u201cThe pads themselves don\u2019t, but tiny hard things like dirt filter through the rug or get underneath it, and then they\u2019re under there for good. Then, every time you step on the rug, it shifts a little bit, and it can actually act like a piece of sandpaper. Because of that, you need a rug pad with a little stick to it, instead of just a soft pad. And you should peel it off every once in a while and sweep underneath it.\u201d"

Set one of the rug pad\u2019s corners up near the rug\u2019s corners, leaving about an inch (2.5 cm)of clearance on either side. For each side where the rug pad hangs off, use a marker and a ruler to draw straight lines an inch (2.5 cm) away from the rug\u2019s edge. Make sure the rug is upside down for this, with the bottom of the rug facing upwards."
