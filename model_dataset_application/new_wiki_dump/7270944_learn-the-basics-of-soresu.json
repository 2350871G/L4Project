Dodging can be very effective, but make sure you get completely out of the way or you could still get hit. If your opponent is using a lightsaber, get even further out of the way, as they can change the angle of attack partway through."

      "description":"If you have some experience in Shii-Cho, you should already know this. If you don't:\nA head block (zone 1) consists of holding your lightsaber horizontally in front of or above your head. A leg block (zones 5 and 6) consists of holding your lightsaber near your hip, with the blade pointing downwards. A body block (zones 2 and 3) consists of holding your lightsaber near your waist, or slightly higher, with the blade pointing upwards. A back block (zone 4) consists of holding your lightsaber at the back of your head, with the blade pointing downwards."

      "headline":"Learn some spins.",
      "description":"If you can spin your lightsaber very fast on either side of you, in a figure-eight motion, you can create a nearly impenetrable blade wall. You should find two ways of doing this, one where the blade is moving downwards as it passes in front of you and one where it is moving upwards as it passes in front of you. This maneuver is very good for deflecting blaster bolts."

In addition, you only have to make slight movements with it to provide full defensive coverage. Saberstaffs specialised for Soresu tend to have shorter blades than usual, making them easier to handle at the expense of range."
