      "description":"Arcades with penny pushers typically have cash exchange machines, where you can exchange a larger cash denomination for pennies. You could also gather up stray pennies in your house before you make your way to the arcade. In the hustle and bustle of a busy arcade, people often lose track of the odd penny. Good places to look that often yield are in between machines, under machines and even on top of machines where people may have left them. Also don't forget to check inside the trays at the lower front of the machine where you collect the coins; you will almost always find some there."

      "description":"Are you trying to make a little bit of money, or hoping to win those cool toy cars scattered inside the machines? If you want to make any money, understand that there's not a great chance of getting much back, even if you're clever. Try a machine with an avalanche of coins just about ready to fall off the edge, and move to another one after you've scooped up the winnings. Don't become too enticed; when you put in one coin, you'll put in two and it'll snowball from there if you're not careful. If you're going for prizes, use machines with a prize right on the edge and central. Don't go for a prize touching the side, as most of these are either jammed or destined to fall into the side holes."

      "description":"You can determine this in a number of ways. First check to see the one with the most coins. That's the one with the most coins on the top layer and the bottom layer. Choose small, narrow machines over wider ones. Most machines with a narrow play area usually have a much better payout rate compared to their bigger counterparts, and fewer coins are needed to move prizes towards the drop zone. Check the orientation of the coins on the bottom layer. If there is a very thick layer of coins bunched up at an angle, find another machine. In these situations, nothing will budge, no matter how many pennies you put in."
