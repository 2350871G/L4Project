You will build a deck around this win condition. It should be high enough level to be strong in your current arena. Some good win condition cards include: Hog Rider, Ram Rider, Royal Giant, Balloon, X-Bow, Miner, Golem, Graveyard, and Three Musketeers. There are many more possible win conditions."

          "headline":"Decide on a deck archetype.",
          "description":"Each player makes a deck of 8 cards prior to each battle. They type of deck you create is called your deck archetype. Your deck archetype should complement your win condition and anticipate what your opponent may use to counter it. Each archetype has it's own strengths and weaknesses. There are many deck archetypes, but the three main ones are Beatdown, Control, and Siege. Some deck archetypes are as follows:\n\nBeatdown: Beatdown decks focus on overpowering your opponent's tower through strength. They have a tanky win condition, such as a Golem, or Giant with high damage troops for backup. These decks start by building up a positive elixir advantage and build a huge push to attack the opponent's tower. Beatdown decks are weak against Control decks but have an advantage against Siege decks. Control:  Control decks are defensive decks that fight from your side of the map. Control decks have a strong defense, which usually includes defensive buildings, such as Cannon, Tesla, and Inferno Tower. These decks spend less elixir to counter huge pushes and chip away at the opponent's tower until it is destroyed. Control decks are weak against Siege decks but have an advantage against Beatdown decks. Siege: Siege archetypes are based around a strong offensive building win condition, such as, Mortar or X-Bow. These buildings attack from your side of the map and force your opponent's units to your side of the map to defend, while you defend your offensive buildings so that they can keep doing damage to your opponent's tower. These decks require a lot skill to play, as they require you to anticipate your opponent's move. Siege decks are weak against Beatdown decks, but strong against Control decks. Hybrid: Hybrid decks combine two archetypes and two win conditions for a deck that is hard to defend against. A hybrid deck might have Sparky and a Graveyard for\n\nCycle: Cycle is a type of Control deck where the deck is very cheap (usually 3.0 or less in average elixir cost) and quickly cycles their win condition faster than your opponent can counter. These decks chip away at the other towers, doing damage over time. Any amount of damage matters. Spell Bait: Spell bait is a type of hybrid deck. These are the only decks to use hordes as a win condition. The goal is to get your opponent to waste their spells, and then overwhelm them with hordes when they can no longer counter your attack. These decks have many cards vulnerable to spells such as Skeleton Army, Princess, Goblin Gang, and Goblin Barrel. Those are common in log bait decks while Royal Hogs, Flying Machine, Barbarians, Minion Horde, and Three Musketeers are used in medium and heavy spell bait."

        {
          "headline":"Aim for an average elixir cost.",
          "description":"The most effective decks are 3.0-4.0 in average elixir cost (AEC). There are good decks higher or lower than that. Cheaper decks are faster but have more fragile troops. Heavy decks have a slower playstyle and are usually Beatdown decks. If you have an average elixir cost of 4.0 or above, you might want to consider having the elixir collector in your deck. This card will collect more elixir for you and allow you to play troops faster. Cycle decks go as low as 2.6 for the AEC since the playstyle requires the player to cycle to their win condition quickly."

          "description":"Do you want a fast deck continually attacking the opponent? Do you want a slow deck that builds up momentum? Or do you want a balance of the two? It is up to you. Troops have different movement speeds. For fast decks, you might want speedy Hog Riders, Elite Barbarians, or Goblins. A slow deck could include the mighty Golem or Executioner."

        {
          "headline":"Make sure you will have a counter for everything.",
          "description":"Get troops that attack air, do splash damage, deal heavy single-target damage, and troops that do more than one at a time. You will need one of each on your deck to make it effective. Musketeer, Minions, and Mini Pekka are some troops that do single-target damage. Wizard, Witch, and Bowler are examples of splash attackers."

Knowing the meta allows you to craft a deck to counter the most commonly used decks. However, be careful so that your deck is not weak to other non-meta decks that are often used. For example, you may see a lot of people running log bait at your trophy range. To counter this, run two small spells in your deck. You can choose from Tornado, Zap, Arrows, Barbarian Barrel, Giant Snowball, and the Log."

Bomb Tower deals splash damage and has a death bomb, pairing well with Tornado. The Barracks spawns Barbarians, Goblin Hut spawns Spear Goblins, Furnace hatches Fire Spirits, and Tombstone raises Skeletons.
