          "description":"Incandescent and even some LED bulbs produce heat while they light your home. Keep temperatures down by only using the lights when absolutely necessary, and utilizing other light sources, like your phone flashlight. You can also unplug any lamps or electronic devices that you aren\u2019t using. Sometimes, even electronics in \u201cstandby\u201d mode can be warm because they\u2019re drawing electricity from the outlet."

          "description":"While it may seem counterproductive, having the windows open lets the hot air from outside into the home. As soon as the sun comes up, close and lock the windows to keep the cooler air trapped in your home. If your windows don\u2019t lock or you feel some air leaking in when you close them, consider placing a towel along the sash where the window opens to block the air."

          "description":"Hang up blackout curtains or place a car sun shade in the window during the day. As soon as the sun is up, close the curtains completely or unroll the sunshade to keep the sunshine from heating your home. Car sun shades normally have a shiny backing material that reflects the sun and work well for smaller windows. Blackout curtains absorb the sunlight and tend to work well for larger windows."

          "headline":"Open your windows and use fans to amplify a breeze at night.",
          "description":"Once the sun goes down, set up a large fan in front of an open window to blow cooler air into the room. If you have a ceiling fan, turn it on to circulate the air throughout the room. If it\u2019s an extremely warm night, spritz yourself with cold water from a water bottle and stand in front of the fan before going to sleep. This can cool down your body temperature immensely and help you get to sleep."

          "headline":"Get a dehumidifier to keep moisture down during hot days.",
          "description":"Humidity can make heat feel a lot worse than it really is. Invest in a basic dehumidifier for the rooms where you spend the most time, like the living room and bedroom. The dehumidifier will pull moisture from the air, making the heat less muggy. Dehumidifiers can be helpful even if you have a window air conditioning unit because they remove the moisture from the air before it circulates into the air conditioner, making the process more efficient. Without a dehumidifier, the air conditioner would have to cool and dehumidify the air."

          "description":"During the summer, it\u2019s best to eat cold meals or do most of your cooking with the microwave or outside on a grill. Keep your stove and oven turned off on the hottest days to keep the air as cool as possible.If you need to cook inside, consider using a griddle or panini press to cook, which have less power and will give off less heat into the kitchen. Your dishwasher can also make your home hotter in the summer. Try washing your dishes by hand to avoid releasing hot, moist air into your home."

To keep cool and avoid the harsh sun, stay indoors or go to a location that has air conditioning if you don\u2019t have it at your home.

When you\u2019re doing an outside activity, take time to sit under a tree, relax under an umbrella, or hang out in a tent to replenish your energy. If you\u2019re going somewhere where there won\u2019t be many shady places to sit, remember to pack an umbrella or tent.

If you want to do something outside, plan a day of hiking in a forest under the shade of trees, or take a walk along a river or stream with a strong breeze.

If you\u2019re running errands or going to work, wear clothes made of light materials like linen, cotton, silk, or other breathable fabrics.

Symptoms like profuse sweating, mumbling or incoherent speech, convulsions and chills, and vomiting are more serious.
