      "description":"Play the games, collect figures and cards, read magazines, and learn about Pok\u00e9mon. Learn all the names and moves. It may take some time to get used to, but it's definitely worth it. If you have a Pok\u00e9mon game, try to complete it and beat the champion. Gather a good team of Pok\u00e9mon, which will help later. It is recommended that you have a team of 3-6 Pok\u00e9mon, with balanced types and moves. With less Pok\u00e9mon, you can train them more. With more Pok\u00e9mon, you can have more favourites/types. It's up to you. Get to know as much as you can."

You could use a trainer card creator to make a trainer card with your sprite, Pok\u00e9mon, and pretend wi-fi code on it. It will help if you forget your Pok\u00e9mon. Make a note of their moves. Try to stick to real moves that the specified Pok\u00e9mon can actually learn."

For other clothing and accessories, you can wear baseball caps, beanies, scarves (mostly girls), jeans, trainers, sweaters, and hoodies. Try to get these items in white and red and trimmed in black. Sometimes you can find trainer costumes made for Halloween or fancy dress. Using these outfits might be fun."

      "headline":"Get some makeshift equipment.",
      "description":"Use spray bottles with coloured water inside for medicine. Make sure to label them. For HM/TM's use old, unused, blank CD disks. You can spray-paint them and label them if you want to. You can buy or make Pokeballs. Most of them are pretty easy to make if you can't buy them, but you may need to look them up on Google images for designs. For the actual Pok\u00e9mon, you can use figures or pure imagination. Try to find look-alike items for other objects. You're all set!"

Get washed and dressed and groom yourself as you normally do (brushing hair, applying makeup, etc.) before you set out on your adventure. You can go anywhere, from your backyard, to the park, or even the mountains or somewhere on holiday if you feel adventurous. Pick up your starter Pok\u00e9mon, and put it in it's Pokeball, or let it walk with you if it's like Ash's Pikachu, who doesn't like it's Pokeball. Walk around a while, battling 'trainers' and wild Pok\u00e9mon. If you want, you can hide Pok\u00e9mon figures and 'catch' them in Pokeballs, after weakening them of course!"

Watch some movies with friends, or make some Pok\u00e9mon food, like cakes and cookies. Battle with Wi-Fi. Become a Pok\u00e9mon Master. Go to Pok\u00e9mon clubs (they might have one at a local hobby store). You may make it to finals and win. The possibilities are endless. Just remember, You gotta catch 'em all, Pok\u00e9mon!"
