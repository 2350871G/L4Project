If you don\u2019t see the USDA seal on the package, check near the nutritional information to see if it lists where the product was manufactured and if it\u2019s labeled as an organic product. If you don\u2019t see an \u201corganic\u201d label on the product, then it may be low-quality. The requirements for a crop or product to be organic may vary depending on your area. If you\u2019re in the United States, you can check the USDA site to see a list of approved organic brands if you aren\u2019t able to tell from the label. Some CBD products won\u2019t be listed as \u201c100% organic\u201d because they have processed materials, but they can still be labeled \u201corganic,\u201d meaning that less than 5% of the ingredients are not organic."

Check the ingredient list and check the amounts listed for each ingredient. Make sure the ingredients include the word \u201corganic\u201d or have asterisks next to them, or else the product may have been processed. If you don\u2019t see any organic labels in the ingredient list, then it may not have been harvested properly. If you don\u2019t see any ingredients listed, then avoid the product completely since it could be low-quality.

Look up the batch number online along with the name of the brand so you can see the lab results.
