Such items, if left in the pockets, could damage your new clothing when you go to wash it. Remove any items like pens, money, hair ties, or anything else. Turn the pockets inside out so you know whether you\u2019ve searched that article of clothing already."

There are a number of things you\u2019ll need to look for when examining your thrift store clothes:\nStains that should be treated. Rips or tears that need to be repaired.

Care tags are included on almost all mass produced clothes and will provide instructions for how to clean and care for the clothing. Care tags are often located on the back collar of shirts and blouses, or on the middle of the back waist on pants. Homemade and boutique clothes may not have care tags. In this case, use your best judgement to determine the fabric and how to care for it. If you\u2019re not sure, you should probably just dry clean the item. When looking at care tags, identify instructions about the temperature of water you need to use when washing your clothes, instructions for drying your clothes, instructions for bleaching your thrift store clothes, and instructions about how to iron your clothes."

This is important, as some scents may persist through a normal wash. There are a number of ways to remove the smell from thrift store clothes:\nUse activated charcoal or kitty litter. Place your cloths in a plastic bag and place the bag in air tight plasticware for a couple of days with activated charcoal or kitty litter. The charcoal or kitty litter will remove scents from your clothes. Remember, though, don't let the kitty litter or charcoal come into direct contact with your clothing. Steam your thrift store clothes. Steaming your clothes might help remove old smells or bad scents. Dab your clothes with white vinegar. In many cases, acidic white vinegar will help remove smells from old clothes. This works best with newer white clothing, but may be too abrasive for delicate darks."
