Only pour in as much water as you'd like to brew, since the machine will continue to brew until the reservoir is empty. Always use clean filtered water for the best taste. Filtered water can also prevent mineral deposits from building up on the machine's tubing."

Or, your machine may have a reusable metal mesh filter that is shaped like a cone. If you use a paper filter, be sure to use one that's large enough to fit your pot. If you use a reusable filter, take care to clean it in between brewing.

Rich Lee\t\t\tCoffee & Food Program Director, Spro Coffee Lab\t\t\t\tDid You Know? Paper filters are the most commonly used for coffee. There are two types of paper filters\u2014bleached and unbleached. Bleached filters introduce less paper flavor into your coffee."

Use 1 heaping tablespoon of grounds for every 5 ounces of water. Place the grounds in the filter. You can always adjust this ratio, using more or less coffee or water to get your desired coffee strength. Store unused ground coffee in an airtight container away from light, heat, and moisture. Try to use it within a week."

Some coffee makers have an automatic start feature which you can set at this point. If you do, you can program the machine to start brewing coffee at a certain point during the day, so long as it's prepared. At this point, water and coffee grounds should already be in the machine."

But, some coffee makers allow you to customize how much water you'd like to brew, how strong you want your coffee, or how long you'd like to brew it. Read your machine's owner's manual to learn about it's brewing capabilities. Avoid leaving the carafe or pot on the burner while the machine is on for a long time after your coffee has brewed into it. This can continue to cook the coffee, giving it a burnt taste."

Instead, toss or compost your used coffee grounds. Wash out the coffee pot or carafe and don't forget to rinse out the filter or filter holder. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for deep cleaning the machine on a regular basis. This usually involves alternating brew cycles of hot water and vinegar which can prevent mineral buildup in the machine."

Be sure to use clean, filtered water for the best taste. If you're brewing a very dark roast, try to heat your water to 195 \u00b0F (91 \u00b0C) to prevent over-dissolving and bitterness.

This will help create a seal against the Chemex pot, can get rid of any paper taste from the filter, and preheats your pot, so you don't end up with cold coffee."
