With larger batches of humans, you are more likely to be shot in the head faster. You don't want the humans to be shooting into a field of (re)killed zombies, so wait a bit longer before you \"die\". You may have to receive a few headshots. Because some people are just like that, you may sometimes experience a round in which one or multiple people continue to \"double-tap\" you after you have fallen. When that happens, quickly stand back up and resume your shambling. Continuing to play dead when you are being shot is not fun for the audience, and probably won't feel much better for you."
