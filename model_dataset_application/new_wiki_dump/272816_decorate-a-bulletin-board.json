Wait each coat to dry before applying a new one. Use a foam brush or paintbrush to apply the acrylic paint. If your board is very large, use a foam paint roller instead. You can also use chalkboard paint. Paint your board with a paint primer first, then apply two to three coats of chalkboard paint. Once the paint dries, cover the entire board with chalk, then wipe the chalk off. This is known as \"priming.\""

Carefully remove the stencil before the paint dries. Allow the paint to dry (at least 20 minutes for most brands) before you put anything on it. If the stencil moves too much, tape down the edges with painter's tape. Consider painting the cork part a solid color first.

You might want to use a solid-colored background and letters, as well as large, simple shapes, when decorating it. This will keep the designs from clashing. Fabric is great because pins and staples won't leave holes in it. It also won't fade, rip, or tear. If it wrinkles, all you have to do is iron it out."

Each bottom piece should be sticking out from beneath the upper one by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Use paper cutouts, such as hearts, snowflakes, leaves, or clover, to make your border. They should be smaller than your hand. Try to use different shades to add variety. For example, if you are using hearts, use red and pink paper. Use other items for borders, such as pompoms, playing cards, fake flowers, or even crumpled tissue paper."
