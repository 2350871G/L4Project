          "description":"Mold spores in the air are often directly caused by mold growing inside your home. By eliminating spots of visible mold, you will significantly reduce the amount of invisible mold spores in the air. To identify visible mold, look for fuzzy stains that are black, green, or white in color, in enclosed spaces and rooms with a lot of moisture, such as the basement. Use sprayable mold remover to kill mold on hard surfaces, such as glass or tile. For mold on surfaces that are more difficult to clean, such as drywall, consider seeking professional help."

In the kitchen, mold is particularly likely to grow in refrigerator drip pans, door seals, and garbage pans.
