Put your middle finger through the new loop, with the double strings towards your ring finger. The loop will tighten around your finger. The part of the loop with two strings should go towards your ring finger."

Form your arm into a muscle, bent at the elbow with your forearm perpendicular to your upper arm, which should be straight out from your body. Flip your arm down into a throw, letting the yo-yo roll out of your hand as you do. Your arm should be straight out in front of you by the end.

If you can't get your yo-yo to come back up, work on throwing a little harder. This trick will only work on a responsive yo-yo, one meant to come back up.

  "text":" Trying Basic Tricks Make a loop with the string for your finger. Even though yo-yos come with loops, they often won't fit your finger tightly.

Learning the Basics of String Tricks (1A) Perfect the front mount. Once you throw your yo-yo, let it spin below in sleeper to work it into a front mount. Use your other hand to push the side of your index finger into the string from behind, lifting the string up as you go. The hand holding the end of the string goes under the yo-yo from the back, threading the string around the yo-yo as you bring it to the front. Bring your dominant hand up to the height of your other hand. You should have three even lengths of string in front of you now. Teach yourself the breakaway. A breakaway is a throw you do across the front of your body, which is important in string tricks. Make sure the string is on the top of the yo-yo. The yo-yo should be in your dominant hand with your palm face up. Lift your elbow out to the side to get a bit more power, and then roll the yo-yo off the edge of your hand facing outward, towards your thumb. As it rolls, let it flip in front of you towards your other arm. Figure out the side mount. A side mount is when you start with a breakaway, but then you mount the yo-yo on the string with your other hand. As you come across your body, flip the yo-yo underneath your other hand, and let the string go around your index finger. The yo-yo will flip over your finger. Have it land on top of the string that's going in front of your body. Work on a side bind with a non-responsive yo-yo. A bind is when you pull your yo-yo back to your hand on a non-responsive yo-yo (the kind that won't automatically come back to your hand). Start by throwing a breakaway. As it comes towards your other hand, place a finger from that hand underneath the string. With your dominant hand holding the string, pull the string around the yo-yo and up the other side. As you come around with the string, let go of the loop of string you've created over your non-dominant hand, and then pull up with your throwing hand to return the yo-yo to your hand. Use a split bottom mount. Throw the yo-yo out in front. With your non-dominant hand, press into the string from the back so the yo-yo swings backwards. Use your index finger from your throwing hand, and let the yo-yo wrap around your finger, landing on top of that part of the string. Dismount your yo-yo. To dismount your yo-yo, you go in the opposite direction of the mount you did. So for a front dismount, start in the front mount. Unwrap the string from the yo-yo, and return the yo-yo to your hand. Turning 1A Basics into Tricks Perform the brain scramble (brain twister). Start by getting into a front mount from a front throw.
