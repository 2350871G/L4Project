For the herbs themselves you can sell them fresh or dried. You'll need packaging and you'll also want to make sure that you provide them freshly cut to your customers. This isn't the best way to market your herbs, but it can be done. Some restaurants need regular shipments of fresh parsley for their dishes. If you're going to do this you need to make sure you have a heated greenhouse for the winter months and a couple of years in to know that you can provide the need or you may lose a customer forever."

Or if you're doing it extremely cheap and as a side thing you can use plastic wear handles. I prefer these to Popsicle sticks because after many waterings the wood will give up even the most permanent marker. And if you don't know what the plant is you won't sell much. Something else to do for the customer is to give them a print out about the plant, the care and the uses, since most people don't want to buy something they don't know about. That way you can get the newbies that want to try herbs but are afraid to invest the money."
