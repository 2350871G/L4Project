          "description":"If the room's ceiling is painted a dark color, or has dark wooden beams, it is probably casting a pall over the entire room. Buy a can or two of white paint and give the ceiling a fresh coat. The bright white will reflect light instead of absorbing it, and you'll be amazed at what a difference it makes. If you prefer to use color instead of plain white, try a pale yellow, mint or cream. Even if you don't paint the walls white, painting the ceiling white will still make a big difference."

          "headline":"Limit accent colors.",
          "description":"You might be tempted to paint the room your favorite rich, deep color, but it's best to save bright and bold colors for accent walls or trim. In a dark room, a deep color won't look brilliant - it'll just add to the dark feel of the space. If you absolutely must use dark blue, green, red or another rich color, choose one small wall to paint, and paint the rest in a much lighter color. Another way to incorporate some color without making the space darker is by adding a stenciled accent trim along the ceiling. Buy or make a stencil in a shape that suits your taste - flowers, leaves, and abstract designs are popular - and use your favorite paint color to make a pretty pattern. Painting the baseboards and door trim a contrasting color is another way to add a festive touch to the room without making it too dark."

          "description":"If you're working with a dark room, chances are you don't have a lot of natural light coming in, but it's important to make the most of what you have. If your windows are covered with dark shades or blinds, you're blocking out your best chance for brightening up the room. Instead of keeping your blinds closed, try the following:\nChoose airy, light-colored window coverings that don't completely block out the light. For example, cream-colored linen or canvas curtains will provide privacy while still allowing the sunshine to filter into the room. If you prefer blinds, look for cloth blinds in a light fabric that isn't completely opaque. Avoid wooden or plastic blinds that block out all of the light."

          "description":"Harsh overhead lighting can actually highlight the fact that a room is naturally dark. Instead of flooding the space with fluorescent lighting, choose your artificial lighting carefully so that it looks as natural and pleasant as possible. Track lighting can really brighten a space without creating a harsh atmosphere. Use plenty of strategically-placed floor lamps with light-colored shades to diffuse light all over the room."

This reflected light provides a soft, overhead glow which minimizes harsh shadows. Candles shouldn't be overlooked as a pleasant source of extra light. When you want to create an especially bright, cheerful atmosphere, light some candles in addition to using artificial lighting."

Higher wattage does not mean a higher light level. You may also experiment with the subtle coloring of the lights. Bulbs that are classified as \"daylight\" usually put out light with a temperature around that of direct sunlight, and provide a cooler, bluer, more vivid light. \"Soft white\" bulbs have a lower light temperature which provides a warmer, more yellow light."

Paint it a deep color and use rich, heavy decorations to create the feel of an old-fashioned parlor. Colors like charcoal and slate blue are popular choices for rooms that are meant to have a stately feel."

          "description":"Look at your artwork, knicknacks, book collection, and other decorations in the room you're trying to brighten up. Is anything adding to the feeling that the space is overly dim? It might be time to switch out that old black-and-white print for something more lively and bright. If you have stacks of books, a collection of old dolls or a wall of deep green plants, it might be time for those to go, too. If you're committed to brightening up your space, you might have to make some tough decisions about what to keep. Choose your top 10 or so favorite books and display them artfully, rather than having your entire collection take up a wall in the dark room. The space that was previously covered with books can now be brightened up with something more cheerful. If you're a plant lover, think about getting rid of big, dark plants and replacing them with plants that are lighter in color. Displaying a few succulents or ferns is an attractive touch, but having racks of plants can make a room feel darker."

Choose mirrors with light-colored frames that add to the room's airy feel. Hanging mirrors in a room has the added benefit of making it feel larger."

Heavy furniture can make even the brightest room look a little dreary. If you want to brighten things up, choose furniture with lighter wood. You can also paint or refinish your existing furniture to give it a room-brightening makeover. Buy brightly-colored slipcovers for your sofa and chairs."

Try keeping them neatly wound and secured with a piece of velcro. You can also tape the wires against the baseboard using light-colored electrical tape to keep them out of the way. You'll find that this seemingly trivial change makes a big difference."

However, investing a little more time and money to put in new flooring or refinish what you have might be worth it in the long run. If you really want to brighten up your room, consider the following:\nIf you have painted hardwood floors, refinish the floors to expose the light wood underneath. You might also consider painting the floors a brighter color, like pearl gray. Concrete floors are sturdy and practical, and they come in many different colors. The finished concrete is polished until it's smooth and gleaming. Brightly-colored tiles are a good choice for kitchens and bathrooms."

This is commonly done where a wall blocks a room from a hallway, for example. If the wall doesn't contain beams that are holding up the ceiling, knocking it out shouldn't be a problem. You'll want to hire a contractor to take a look at the room before deciding to knock out a wall by yourself. In some cases the wall might be serving a structural purpose. In old houses and apartments, it's also important to make sure the wall doesn't contain lead or asbestos before attempting to knock it down."
