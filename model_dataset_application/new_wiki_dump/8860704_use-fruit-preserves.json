          "description":"Place chicken wings in a bag with strawberry preserves or orange marmalade. Use about one cup (237 ml) of preserves for every pound (.45 kg) of chicken wings. Let the bag of wings sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. Grill or bake them as you wish. Any type of preserves can be used, based on what you prefer. Grill the wings for 7-10 minutes on each side. Bake them for roughly 30-60 minutes at 350\u2109 (177\u2103). Either way, make sure the internal temp reaches 165\u2109 (74\u2103). Check with a meat thermometer."

          "description":"Grab some thawed, raw pork chops, a sharp paring knife, preserves, and a spoon. Slice lengthwise down the side of the chops, opening a pocket inside. Scoop your favorite preserves into the inside of the meat. Bake the pork chops as you normally would, or for about 30 minutes at 365\u2109 (185\u2103). Internal temperature for pork is recommended at 145\u2109 (63\u2103). Cherry, apple, fig, or any kind of pepper preserves go well with pork, but don't be afraid to experiment with other preserves."

Then scoop it over spare ribs, meatballs, chicken breast, pork cutlets, or any other meat. Let the meat soak in the marinade and cook it as you normally would. Lemon, pineapple, and plum preserves work well, but try out different options to find what you like the best."

Use a store bought brownie kit or follow your own brownie recipe. After you mix the brownies up, fold the preserves into the batter. Use \u00bd cup (118  ml) to one cup (236.6 ml). It may take a bit of experimenting to get the right amount of preserves. If you make the brownies once and the fruit taste isn\u2019t very strong, add a little more next time. Any fruit can be used, but the ones mentioned above tend to mix well with chocolate."

Then put about one tablespoon of fruit preserves on top of the muffin mix. Fill each muffin section the rest of the way with muffin mix. Bake the muffins as you normally would. The muffins will bake up as usual but will now have a tasty, gooey center of fruit preserves."

Press the edges with a fork to mold the two pieces together. Freeze the tarts for a few hours, then bake for 25 minutes at 375\u2109 (190 \u2103). This works for pretty much any flavor of preserves, depending on what you have and your preference. If you want, after you take the poptarts out of the oven, top them with some warm cream cheese spread or icing."

For a single serving, use about \u2153 cup (78.9 ml) whipped cream and \u00bd cup (118 ml) fruit preserves. Crush four or five cookies into the mix.

Mixed berry and raspberry are great for vodka. It\u2019s best to add the alcohol and fruit preserves to a shaker and shake it to mix them thoroughly. Pour the drink over ice. Sometimes it\u2019s best to strain it, as well."
