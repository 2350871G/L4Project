  "text":" Preparing the Ingredients Cut the head off your shrimp with a sharp knife.  Devein the shrimp. Your shrimp will have a natural arch to it so cut along the middle of the inner arch up to the tip of the tail where the intestinal tract is. From the cut, a black line (the shrimp's vein) will become visible. Remove the vein with your hands or a fork and wash the shrimp under running water. Repeat this step for every shrimp you have. Squeeze lime juice all over the shrimp. This cuts down on the fishy scent. Check your mussels and make sure they are not broken or give off an excessively bad smell. Do not use them if they are. The smell and broken shell is an indicator that they are rotten. You want your mussels to be tightly closed. Take a mussel and debeard it. On a mussel, there is the beard-like attachment hanging off of it. You can either pull this off or cut it off. Once you have debearded the mussel, take a scouring pad or a stiff brush and scrub off any barnacles that are attached to the mussel. Repeat this for all of your mussels and wash them together under running water. Wash your crab legs under running water. This ensures that debris, like sand, is washed off of your crab legs. Rinse your crayfish to make sure all the debris is washed off. Always store your crayfish on ice to preserve freshness, when you're not cooking with them. Cut the sausage into 1 inch (2.5 cm) slices on a cutting board. Repeat for the remaining sausages. Husk the corn. Peal the green part off the corn to reveal the inside. Continue to pull the stringy material off of the corn cob and then rinse. Repeat this step for the remaining ears of corn. Cut the ear of corn in half. Repeat for the remaining corn until you have 6 halves. Slice the lemons into halves. You will have 4 lemon halves. Peel the onion and then rinse it. After this, cut into quarters. Rinse the ginger root. Cut it thickly until you\u2019ve used the entire root. Cut your two celery stalks into 1 inch pieces.  Wash the six red potatoes. Cut them in halves. Cooking Prepare a pot of water and let it come to a boil.  Add all of your powdered ingredients together: paprika, pepper, parsley, bay leaves, and Knorr seasoning.  Pour in your canola oil. Stir well to make sure your ingredients haven\u2019t clumped together. Add the onions and garlic cloves and stir. Add in the sausage, celery, ginger, lemon, potatoes, and corn. Boil for about 20 - 30 minutes or until the potatoes have softened. Keep stirring periodically to make sure nothing sticks. Put the crayfish and the crab legs in and boil for 10 minutes. Place the mussels in and boil until they have opened up. Add in the shrimp and boil for 5 minutes. Stir the pot so that all of the ingredients are mixed in well. Boil for about 5 minutes. After this, pour the contents of the pot into the large tin pan. Enjoy! Now that everything is prepared, you and your company can dig in.",
