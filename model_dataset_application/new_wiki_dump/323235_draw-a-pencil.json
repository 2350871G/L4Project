They're going diagonally up and to the right in the image shown, but they can point in any direction you want so long as you keep them parallel. At the top, draw two curved lines for the ferrule (the piece that holds the eraser). Draw a semicircle above that for the eraser. Draw a triangle at the other end of the pencil and a curved line for the lead. If you want a blunt, well-used pencil, you should round off the tip so it looks as though it's been pressing into a page. Sketch in quarter circles connecting the lines for the sharpened markings.
