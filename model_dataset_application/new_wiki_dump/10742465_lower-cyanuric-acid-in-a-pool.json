          "description":"A submersible sump pump is a device that will be able to drain your pool quickly. Many hardware stores will offer to rent them to you for around a day at a time or may have them for sale. Buy a pump for long-term use or rent one early in the day to drain your swimming pool. If you often have difficulties balancing your pool chemistry, it may be worth it to purchase a submersible sump pump. Your local pool store may also have submersible sump pumps that available for rental or purchase. Alternately, you could ask a friend with a pool if they have one you could borrow."

          "headline":"Dilute your pool water if the levels are above 80 ppm.",
          "description":"The easiest way to lower the levels of cyanuric acid in your pool is to simply dilute the water. Partially drain your swimming pool by the same percentage by which you want to reduce your cyanuric levels. Calculate the percentage by which you want to reduce the cyanuric acid level and remove around the same percentage of water from your pool. It\u2019s easier to add cyanuric acid to the pool than it is to remove it, so it\u2019s better to overcompensate and dilute the water more than you think you need to."

          "description":"If your cyanuric acid levels are too high, the easiest solution is to completely drain the pool and fill it with fresh water. Use a submersible sump pump to empty your pool completely. Take advantage of your empty pool and give it a good clean. Use a calcium, lime, and rust remover to clean away calcium or scale rings. Check your local guidelines for more information on where the water you drain from your pool should go. In many cases, you can drain the water into a clean out. A clean out is a small pipe located near the bottom of your home, often near a bathroom or kitchen. Water sent into the clean out will drain into the sewer and be reused by the city."

Run 1 or more garden hoses into the bottom of your pool and turn them on. Keep an eye on the pool while it fills up to prevent it from overflowing. The water level should be roughly halfway up the pool skimmer."

After 3 or 4 hours, use a water test strip or a water quality test kit to check the levels of chlorine and cyanuric acid in your pool. Your pool should have a chlorine level between 2.0 and 3.0 ppm and a cyanuric acid level between 30 and 50 ppm. If these levels are right, then you shouldn\u2019t need to do anything more to alter them."

Dissolve the cyanuric acid in roughly 5 gallons (19 L) of water and pour it into your pool. Water chemistry and cyanuric acid calculators can be found online and will do all the math needed to work out how much cyanuric acid you should add."

Test your cyanuric acid levels after the filter has had time to run to make sure it is at a safe level. If you have frequent problems with cyanuric acid levels, there may be something else wrong."

If the chlorine levels are above 5.0 ppm, leave the pool exposed to sunlight or use a chlorine neutralizer to lower it. A chlorine level of around 2 to 3 ppm is usually best for a swimming pool.
