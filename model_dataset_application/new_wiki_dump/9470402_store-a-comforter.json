Wash your comforter in a front-loading washing machine with mild detergent. A down comforter should be washed on a delicate cycle or hand washed.

Place a dryer ball or dryer ring in with your comforter to help prevent it from clumping while drying. If you have a synthetic comforter, you can let it air dry as an alternative to using a dryer. Down comforters should not air dry. Always try to use a large-capacity dryer \u2014 comforters become even heavier once they're soaking wet, and you don\u2019t want your dryer to break due to the weight and strain."

Once your comforter comes out of the dryer, touch it to see if it's still damp. If it is still wet, you can either throw it back in the dryer to run another cycle, or you can lay it out overnight."

Most of these bags will have a drawstring or zipper to close it. While the bag doesn't need to close all the way, sealing it up will prevent dirt and bugs from being able to reach it."
