Don\u2019t stuff the salad greens in too tightly. While other storage methods work for salad greens, the container and paper towel method will help keep them fresh a little longer."

When greens go bad, they turn a little brown and get a slimy texture. Consider freezing kale or spinach to last longer. Other greens don\u2019t freeze as well."
