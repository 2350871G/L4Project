Scrub it on in a circular motion, then be sure to rinse it all off -- it will leave a residue if left to dry on the sink. Mix some ammonia or lemon juice in for further stain-fighting power."

Rinse and wipe the sink for an easy, hassle-free clean. Make sure you do this in a well-ventilated area (or open a window) to prevent inhaling bleach fumes. Never do this on colored porcelain or antiques, as it can damage the color or any wood or metal fixtures attached to the porcelain."
