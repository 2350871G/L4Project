  "text":" Preparing the Shaft Sand the entire shaft using fine grade sandpaper. Ensure it is completely smooth and free from splinters. This will also allow the fletching to stick more easily to the shaft, and give you an opportunity to fully inspect the wood for any nicks or damage. Varnish the shaft if you plan on leaving the arrows outside. This will protect them from weathering, but if you intend to leave them inside, this is unnecessary. Forming the Ends Sharpen one end of the shaft using the tip side of the sharpener. The tip end is longer than the nock end. Apply superglue to the sharpened end of the shaft and inside the glue-on point. Points can come in all different shapes and sizes. Make sure you are using the correct points for the type of archery you will be doing. Press the glue-on point onto the tip and hold for approximately 30 seconds. The glue will run over the sides of the point. Remove any excess glue using a paper towel. Sharpen the other end of the shaft using the nock side of the sharpener.  Apply superglue to the sharpened nock end of the shaft and inside the glue-on nock.  Press the glue-on nock onto the end and hold for approximately 30 seconds. Once again, the glue will run over the sides and you can remove excess with a paper towel. Adding the Fletching Insert the shaft into the jig. The nock of the shaft should fit comfortably into the jig. It should not be loose or wobbly, but should press against the back part. Make sure it is placed on a flat, stable surface before using. Measure and cut tape according to the length of the fletching that will be used. Each fletching should be the same length, with only slight variation. To save on tape, measure and cut each piece according to each fletching. Place the fletching into the fletching bracket on the jig. Before using the jig, do a few practice tests to make sure the fletching will be where you want it on the shaft. It can be adjusted by using the nobs on the bottom portion. Apply tape to the very edge of the fletching. Rub the protected side of the tape on the fletching to ensure proper contact. The tape is very brittle but very sticky. Because it is double-sided, it can be difficult to handle. Remove the protected side of the tape. This should be done carefully, so you do not also pull out the fletching when you remove the protection. Press the fletching bracket and the shaft together. Using magnets, the bracket will latch on to the jig. Carefully move the bracket to exactly where you want the fletching on the shaft. Turn the dial on the jig to attach the next fletching. The dial is located on the bottom of the jig and will stop at the correct interval depending on the type of jig it is. Repeat until all pieces of the fletching have been attached.
