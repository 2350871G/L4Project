Budget dishwashers can clean dishes very well, but might not have as many features and might be louder. More expensive dishwashers tend to be quieter and have more features. Budget dishwashers cost around 200-600 dollars, but more expensive dishwashers can be as much as 2,200 dollars."

Standard dishwashers are 24 inches, but there are more compact dishwashers that are 18 inches. When deciding the size of the dishwasher you will need, consider the size of your family and how often you do dishes. A standard size family should opt for a standard size dishwasher if they have room in their kitchen."

Go to many stores or websites to compare prices to find the best deal. Some retailers will install the dishwasher for you. There are also retailers who will take away your old dishwasher.

Amazon is a good place to find reviews about dishwashers, but also check the website of the dishwasher manufacturer for more input. Consider buying a dishwasher model that has at least 3/5 stars."

Your dishwasher might come with a warranty that last from three months to one year. After that time period the manufacturer is not responsible for any problems unless you buy an extended warranty or service plan. You might want to consider buying a warranty if your dishwasher costs more than 500 dollars."

Energy Star dishwashers are more strict and use no more than 295 kWh per year and 4.25 gallons of water per cycle.
