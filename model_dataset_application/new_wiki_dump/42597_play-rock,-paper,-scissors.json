Maybe you\u2019re trying to decide who gets the last slice of pizza or who should be first in line to try out a new waterslide. In most cases, Rock, Paper, Scissors is played as a means to help make a choice or put an end to a disagreement. The idea is that both players have an equal chance of winning, making the game random but fair. Rock, Paper, Scissors can be used to decide anything from what movie you see with your friends to who should inherit a collection of priceless paintings. In fact, Sotheby's and Christie's Auction Houses once played the game to decide who would auction an $18M art collection and earn a nearly $3M commission. Christie's won because as the Chairman's daughters said \"Everyone chooses scissors.\" While patterns do emerge during gameplay, they are neutralized by the unpredictability of the other player\u2019s choice."
