Add the pieces to the water, and let it boil for about 15 minutes. It doesn't need to be a rolling boil, just a simmer, so turn the heat down if it seems too hot. When it's done, take it off the stove, and let the ginger sit in the water until the water is cool to the touch. It could take 15 to 30 minutes to cool, depending on the temperature of the room. Remove the ginger. Ginger may help with muscle soreness."
