          "description":"The down payment will be the largest immediate cost of buying a home. If you can pay for at least 20% of the total cost of your home up front, you will not have to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), which protects the lender against you defaulting on your loan. If you must buy PMI, your monthly payments may be significantly higher. You\u2019ll also be able to get a better interest rate from mortgage companies, saving you money in the long run. You don't have to save up a 20% down payment in order to buy a house. Some loans will allow you to put 0% down, while others may require 3%, 3.5%, 5%, or 10%. Work with your lender to find the best option for you. However, paying this little will cause you to have to pay PMI. Some companies may allow you to skip PMI in return for paying a higher interest rate. This may or may not be a better option for you. Talk to a tax advisor to find out the best way to keep costs down."

          "description":"Closing costs include the inspection fees, property taxes, appraisal fees, escrow fees, lender insurance, recording fee, and the prepaid interest charged by your mortgage company. You may also need to pay extra fees directly to your lender, such as a charge to check your credit and a loan origination fee. All together, these will usually total between 2-5% of the total cost of the home. Moving expenses in the U.S. will generally run you between $400 and $2,000 USD. Although your inspection and appraisal fees are part of your closing costs, you will pay them when the services are rendered. In some cases, you'll need to pay for your first year of home insurance at closing, as well. Prepaid interest is the total interest that accrues between the day you close on your mortgage loan payment and your first official mortgage payment."

Once you know about how much you can afford to pay per month, you\u2019ll be able to figure out the total amount you\u2019ll want to spend on your new house! Use online mortgage calculators like https://smartasset.com/mortgage/mortgage-calculator. These calculators will help you find out your mortgage terms, including your mortgage payment, interest rate, number of payments, frequency of payments, fees, and lender insurance, if applicable. Online calculators allow you to change these factors and see how the changes will affect your monthly expenses. Don\u2019t forget to factor in your credit.

All told, this will add up to about 28% of the total cost of your home plus whatever you need for 6 months of mortgage payments and other expenses. So if your home value is $250,000 USD, make the following calculations:\n$250,000 x 0.20 = $50,000 USD for your down payment. $250,000 x 0.05 = $12,500 USD for your closing costs. $250,000 x 0.03 = $7,500 USD for repairs and new furniture/decor. With a mortgage payment of $800/month, 6 months\u2019 worth would be $4,800 USD. With monthly expenses of approximately $2,000/month (not including your mortgage), 6 months\u2019 worth would be $12,000 USD. If you add in moving fees of $1,500 USD, the grand total you\u2019ll need to have saved when you buy is: $88,300 USD."
