And if an unexpected event does happen you can stay calm; listen to the direction of adults around you, like your teachers or parents and follow your plan. If there were an emergency and we were not together in the same place ...\n\nHow would we get in touch with each other? Decide that each member will call or e-mail the same person. For example, each person will contact Uncle Bob first. If he's not home, each person will contact Aunt Suzie instead. If cell phones are not working, you should try using a land-line phone at a neighbor's or friend's house, or a public telephone. Everyone should have coins or a prepaid phone card to make the call. It might be easier to reach a person who's out of town. You can contact him or her to let them know you're okay. Where would we meet? Choose an easy-to-find location near your home, then practice getting there from different locations around your neighborhood. Also, choose an easy-to-find location outside of your neighborhood in case you can't get home. With your parents, practice getting to that location from school, sports practice, or other places where you have after-school activities. How would we remain in contact? You should keep a copy of your family's contact numbers and meeting place(s) taped to the inside of your binder or homework notebook, in your book bag, or your wallet. Your plan should include all the phone numbers you might need. Remember, you might have trouble getting through on the phone during an emergency. Just keep trying. What would I do if I were at school? Make sure your parents talk to your teacher or school principal about the school's emergency plan. Depending on the unexpected event, your school may have a plan in place that will have you stay in your classroom or go somewhere else. The most important things you can do if an emergency happens while you are at school are to stay calm and listen to the direction of your teachers or principal. What would we do about our pets? Your pet disaster kit should include:\nPet food and treats\nDrinkable water in plastic bottles\nCan opener for canned food\nPet medications and medical records in a waterproof container\nSturdy leashes, harnesses and/or carriers so you can move your pets safely and they can\u2019t escape (remember they may be scared and may act different than usual)\nCurrent photos of your pet in case they get lost\nThe name of your veterinarian\nPet beds and toys, if there is room. All your pets should have an identification tag and collar, too. Make a plan for what you'll do with your pets if you can't take them with you. Remember, you may not be able to take them to a shelter."

      "description":"OK, now you have a supply kit and a plan, but what do you actually know about different kinds of weather events and other unexpected situations? The words and terms you hear during emergencies can be confusing. Here's an overview of the most common terms, as well as Web sites you can visit for more information! Tornado A violent storm that appears as a funnel-shaped cone with winds that reach up to 300 mph (480 km/h). Tornado season commonly occurs during the months of March through August, but they can occur at any time. They can happen in any state but are most commonly found in Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas - an area of which is commonly called \"Tornado Alley\".If there are weather or news reports that say there is a tornado in your area, the most important thing to do is to take shelter immediately in a place without windows, such as a bathroom or a basement. Learn more here \u2192\n\n\nEarthquake  The movement of the earth along cracks (called fault lines) in the earth's surface. Earthquakes are measured by something called a Richter scale. While earthquakes are common on the West Coast, they can occur in 45 states and territories across the United States.In an earthquake, remember to DROP, COVER and HOLD ON. DROP to the floor and get under something for COVER and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. Learn more here \u2192\n\n\nFire Emergencies  Fires are unexpected events that can happen anywhere at school, at home, in a store or shopping mall, or even in the outdoors in a forest or field. It is important to always know where the emergency exits are and to remember to be calm during a fire emergency.The most important thing you can do during a fire is listen to the direction of adults around you, like your teacher or parent. Remember to use the stairs (NEVER use an elevator) to leave the building or fire area right away, then [[Call Emergency Services|call thttp://www.usfa.fema.gov/prevention/outreach/children.html Learn more here \u2192]\n\nFlooding  This natural condition happens as a result of river overflow, heavy rains, a dam breaking, or snow melting too fast. This is the most common natural weather event and can happen in every U.S. state. Stay as far away from flood water as you can. Moving flood water can be dangerous because it can knock you off your feet. And any type of flood water can be contaminated, meaning it can contain dangerous substances. Learn more here \u2192\n\n\nTsunami  A giant wave produced by underwater movement due to a variety of natural events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and meteorites. Tsunamis generally appear in the Pacific Ocean. If you feel an earthquake in the Pacific Coast area, turn on your battery-powered radio to learn if there is a tsunami warning. If you hear a tsunami warning, and they say to evacuate, do this immediately. Learn more here \u2192\n\n\nHurricane  A tropical storm with an \"eye.\" Winds must be 74 mph (119 km/h) or stronger for weather to be classified as a hurricane.When hurricanes come onto land, their heavy rain, strong winds and heavy waves can damage buildings, trees and cars. It is important to take shelter in a hurricane and listen to the television or radio for instructions. Learn more here \u2192\n\n\nTerrorism  Terrorism is the use of threat or violence to scare governments into changing their policies. A terrorist can be an individual or a member of an organization. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, are examples of acts of terrorism.Talk to your parents or teacher about this kind of emergency."
