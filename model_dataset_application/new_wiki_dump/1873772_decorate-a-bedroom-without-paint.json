          "description":"Follow the instructions outlined on the packaging regarding installation if you can\u2019t use nails. Typically, you remove 1 side of the adhesive strip and secure it to the hook. Then, remove the other side of the strip, and adhere that side to your wall. Alternatively, use nails or tacks to hang your framed art. Use a hammer to tap the nail into place, or use your fingers to push the tack into the wall. Purchase removable hooks such as Command Strips from most home supply stores."

          "description":"Select a piece of art that you find attractive that is at least 2 ft \u00d7 3 ft (0.61 m \u00d7 0.91 m) big. Then, hang it from your wall using 1-3 large removable hooks. Using 1 large piece of art is a great way to take up lots of wall space. If you\u2019d like, you can also hang smaller decorations around the large piece of art, such as photographs or postcards. Choose abstract art in your favorite colors, or go with art with motifs you enjoy, such as animals, sports, or cars. The art should complement other items in your bedroom, such as the bedding, flooring, or themed decor."

          "headline":"Hang several small or medium-sized pieces of art to fill in the wall space.",
          "description":"If you don\u2019t prefer 1 large piece of art, go with 2-5 smaller pieces instead. Then, arrange them together on one of your walls, based on the particular art style. Use 1-2 removable hooks per piece of artwork. Lay out your pieces before you put up the art hooks to get a good idea of how the pieces should be arranged and spaced. Then, mark the space on the wall where you want each piece to hang. Use a pencil so that you can erase the marks if necessary. You can hang them with 4\u20136 in (10\u201315 cm) in between, or you can stagger them across your wall for an abstract look."

        {
          "headline":"Use posters for an affordable, easy-to-hang option.",
          "description":"You can use 1 or more posters to cover your walls. Either place your posters in poster-sized frames or use regular tacks to hang each corner. If hanging a framed poster, use 1-2 removable hooks. Choose posters of your favorite band, TV show, or movie, for instance. You can also use pictures from magazines, old advertisements, or pages from old books if you find something that matches your decor. In addition, you can also use removable, adhesive tack designed for hanging on walls. Rip a bead-sized ball of tack, and rub it in your hands for 15-30 seconds to warm it up. Then, place 1 ball on each corner. Press each corner onto the wall so it stays in place. Avoid using tape, as it could peel paint up off your walls if you try to take down or move your posters"

          "headline":"Add photographs to your walls for personal touches.",
          "description":"Similar to posters, you can either frame your photographs or use sticky tack to hang individual photos. This is a great way to make your bedroom feel homey and full of love. Pick photos of your pets, family, and friends. You can also use small clothespins and garland to creatively display your photos. Hang both sides of the garland using removable hooks. If you have special or nostalgic photos, it is best to frame them so they do not get ruined. Try to pick photos that have the same color theme and frame them in the same frames. For example, choose all black-and-white photos to hang in a gallery wall."

If you\u2019d like, choose patterned curtains, such as striped, paisley, or plaid. You can also get accent decorations in similar colors to tie your room together, such as pillows, throws, or rugs. Make sure you get the right curtains for your space. Sheer curtains work well for lighter, airy rooms, while blackout curtains will block light and give you extra privacy when drawn closed."

To hang the tapestry, apply a large command strip to each corner, and secure it to your wall. You can also use tacks to hang your tapestry. For example, you can hang a tapestry centered above your bed for a colorful, cozy touch. Many tapestries span the entire size of your wall, so you can easily hang it to decorate your space. Tapestries can help muffle sound, so large ones are great if you have noisy neighbors or roommates. For a bohemian look, hang 1 tapestry from each of your walls. Try using an attractive piece of fabric if you do not have a tapestry. You can hang it the same way you hang a tapestry."

Choose other colors in your room, such as your bedspread or furniture, and include accent pillows or blankets to brighten up your room. You can arrange your pillows or throw blankets on your bed, couch, or chair, for example. Throws and pillows are also easy to change out from season to season."

It's also great for an accent wall, and for those who have never applied wallpaper with paste. Select a wallpaper in a solid color or a pattern, such as zig-zags, flowers, or trees.
