          "description":"Harsh overhead lights aren\u2019t exactly inviting, but it's important to make sure your entryway is well-lit to welcome guests. An antique lantern or accent lamp add a warmer glow to the room. Groups of candles are a more romantic lighting option. Candles aren\u2019t the most practical. If you like the look, choose battery-powered candles that you can easily turn on instead of having to find the lighter. Light bulbs make a difference. Make sure you have enough light in your entryway for your guests to be able to see around them. For a golden glow, look for bulbs that are 2,700 Kelvins or less. Avoid any labeled as \u201ccool white.\u201d"

          "description":"It will reflect natural light from any nearby windows into the space, making a small foyer look bigger. A mirror by the door also lets you fix your hair or makeup one last time before you head out the door. An oval mirror with an intricate border adds a shabby chic touch while a frameless square mirror looks more contemporary. Placing 3 rectangular mirrors side by side fills a larger wall. Leaning a mirror against the wall or setting a small standing mirror on the table has the same brightening effect."

          "headline":"Use framed photos or prints to add personality to your table.",
          "description":"Pictures of your family, pets, or special events make your entryway feel more like a home. Not to mention they\u2019re a great conversation starter when guests come into your house! Frame inspirational quotes for a little motivation before you leave each day or quirky prints that express your personal style. Find handwritten quotes or original prints and artwork on Etsy or at craft fairs and art stores that you can put into fun frames. For a more polished table, print your photos in black and white. Colorful frames lend a playful touch while mirrored or metallic frames are more statement-making. Choose frames in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors to add dimension and visual interest. Or you can create a gallery wall by using different photos of different sizes, all hung in matching frames."

          "headline":"Freshen up the space with plants or bouquets of flowers.",
          "description":"Incorporate greenery and pretty blooms help your foyer feel more homey and lively at the same time. Flowy vines or succulents create a bohemian vibe while small sculpted shrubs or topiaries look very elegant. Bright blooms like red roses or sunny daisies add a pop of color to your entry table. Choose flowers with sweet scents for an extra pleasant touch. Think roses, gardenias, or lilacs. If you don\u2019t have a green thumb, fake flowers or plants are a great alternative. Dust them frequently to keep them looking nice. Switch out your flowers and greenery to match the season or to complement an upcoming holiday. For example, use evergreen branches in the winter, and sunflowers in the summer."

        {
          "headline":"Arrange decor in a symmetrical layout for a traditional and simple look.",
          "description":"Symmetry is very clean and easy on the eyes. Imagine a line dividing the table in half. Everything you place on the left side, place in the same spot on the right side, too. For example, a square picture frame in the center of the left side should have a matching square frame in the center of the right side. You don\u2019t have to put the exact same objects on both sides. Focus on choosing objects with similar sizes or shapes, instead. An elephant figurine on one side could be mirrored on the other side by a jar that\u2019s the same height. To keep it from being boring, mix up textures and materials or add plants. Pair metal frames with burlap vases filled with hydrangeas. Symmetry won't work for every entryway. If you have limited space or an asymmetrical entry, you may need to play around to find the right arrangement for your table."

An acrylic tray, decorative bowl, or small woven basket are all good options. Be sure to pick something that can stand up to getting scuffed and scratched by keys. Small hooks next to the table will hold keys and purses if you don\u2019t mind them being so visible. If you don\u2019t like the look of keys, sunglasses, or chapstick on the table, choose a container that has a lid or that\u2019s deep enough that you can\u2019t easily see what\u2019s inside."

          "description":"Pick bins or baskets that are big enough to hold multiple pairs of shoes. Open baskets are easier to toss shoes into when you walk in but baskets with lids are better for hiding them. Match your baskets to your decor, whether that\u2019s a classic white wicker basket for a beachy vibe or a metal crate for an industrial feel. You can use one long and low basket or place 2 to 3 taller, chunkier baskets under your table. A shelf underneath the entry table can be used as a shoe rack. Line your baskets with fabric or a basket liner to prevent them from getting ruined by dirt or water that\u2019s on the shoes."

          "description":"A seating option allows guests the chance to sit while taking off their shoes or to wait for a ride when they\u2019re leaving. Choose a plush cushioned bench, 2 to 3 low stools, or a basic wooden bench. Look for one that complements the table, whether it matches or provides an interesting contrast. For example, if your table is made from natural wood, metal stools create an industrial-chic feel. Ottomans double as seating and storage and can easily be slid under an entry table. They come in all different materials from canvas to rattan. If you don't have room to slide anything under your table, set a dining room chair or an accent chair to the side."

Do you want a low table that everyone can reach? Or do you want something higher to keep fragile decor safe from pets or kids?

There are tables with bases made of metal in abstract designs, old farmhouse beams, or traditional peg legs. If your walls are neutral, a table in one of your accent colors will stand out and tie the color scheme together.
