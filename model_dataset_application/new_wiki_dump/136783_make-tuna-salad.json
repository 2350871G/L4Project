  "text":" Classic Canned Tuna Salad Mix the salad ingredients together. Combine a 12-ounce can of solid white tuna, 1/2 cup of chopped celery, 1/4 cups of sliced green onions, and 3 tbsp. of chopped sweet pickles in a bowl. Stir this mixture well so the tuna salad is evenly proportioned. Make the dressing. To make the dressing, stir 1/3 cup mayonnaise, 1 tbsp. lemon juice, and 2 tsp. snipped fresh dill together in a small bowl. Combine the tuna mixture with the dressing. Toss the tuna well to coat the tuna with the dressing. Cover and chill. Chill the tuna salad for 1 to 24 hours. Top the salad with five thin tomato slices. The tomato juice will add a delicious flavor to the salad. Squeeze fresh lemon over the tuna. This will give the tuna salad a fresh, tangy zest. Sprinkle fresh ground pepper over the tuna.  Serve. This dish will taste delicious in the middle of a sandwich, as the base for an open-faced sandwich under melted cheddar cheese, or with mixed greens. Canned Tuna and Boiled Egg Pasta Salad Cook your main ingredients. You'll need to boil 6 eggs and cook an 8-oz package of shell pasta. Then rinse in cold water and drain. Add your eggs, pasta, and 2 cans of tuna to a large bowl. Then add 1 cup of mayonnaise, 1/3 cup of pickle juice, 1 1/4 cups of chopped pickles, and 1/3 cup of chopped onion (optional). Stir everything together.  Taste test. If the tuna needs more sauce, add a little more mayonnaise. If the sauce is too sticky, add a little more pickle juice. Refrigerate until chilled, and serve! This goes great alongside hamburgers. Crunchy Tuna Salad Heat 2 tbsp. olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear 2 8 oz. tuna steaks on one side for five minutes. Heat it until it is lightly browned. Sear the other side for three minutes. To sear the other side, turn the tuna over with a spatula. You can let it cook for a bit longer or for a bit less time according to your preference. Let the tuna rest for five minutes. It needs to cool off before you mix it into the salad. Cut the tuna into 1 x 1/2 inch (2.5 x 1.2 cm) pieces. Place the pieces in a large bowl. Toss the tuna with 1/2 cup diced celery, 1/2 cup finely diced Granny Smith apple, and 2 thinly sliced scallions. Toss these items together until you've created an even blend. Don't take the peel off the apple -- it will add an extra crunch to the salad. Season with salt. Add 1/2 to 1 tsp. of salt to taste, depending on your preference. Fold mayonnaise and 3 tbsp. slivered basil leaves into the tuna. Serve the tuna in radicchio cups. Scoop the tuna into four radicchio cups. Serve it with two slices of toasted peasant bread. Southwest Tuna Salad Mix the salad ingredients together in a large bowl. The salad ingredients are: 2 6 oz. cans of drained tuna, 2 2.5 oz. cans of drained and rinsed sliced black olives, 1 4 oz. can diced and drained green chillies, 1/4 cup diced green bell pepper, 1/4 cup diced white onions, and 2 tbsp. minced cilantro. Mix these together for at least 1-2 minutes until all of the ingredients are thoroughly spread out. Mix the ingredients of the dressing together in a small bowl. The dressing ingredients are: 2 tbsp. mayonnaise, 2 tbsp. sour cream, 2 tbsp. lime juice, 1/2 tsp. garlic salt, 1/2 tsp. ground cumin, 1/4 tsp. chili powder, 1/8 tsp. ground black pepper, 1 tbsp. Tobasco sauce, and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese. Mix them for 1-2 minutes until all of the ingredients are thoroughly blended. Combine the dressing with the salad. Stir the dressing into the salad and mix well. Add 1 tbsp. Tobasco sauce. This will make the salad more spicy and flavorful, and will give it that Southwestern feel. Chill. Let the salad chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour for best results. Serve. Serve this tuna salad on a bed of butter leaf lettuce, put it on a sandwich and melt cheddar cheese on top of it, or even use it as a dip for tortilla chips. Spicy Tuna Salad Cube 2 lbs. of tuna meat. Pour 3/4 cups of vinegar over the tuna.  Let stand for 2 minutes.  Apply pressure to the tuna with a spoon. This will gently squeeze the tuna and will soak in the vinegar. Drain the vinegar. This will help reduce the fishy smell of the tuna. Add the remaining 3/4 cups vinegar to the mix.  Add 1/2 cup calamansi juice, 3 tbsp. ginger, 2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. ground black pepper, and 2 tbsp. of chopped red chillies to the mix. You can add these in any order. Once all of the ingredients are added, mix them well to make the salad evenly proportioned. Cover the bowl.  Refrigerate for at least two hours. As the tuna refrigerates, the vinegar will cook it somewhat. Mince 1 large red onion.  Top the salad with the onion and serve. The onion will add a crisp and crunchy taste to the spicy salad. Eat this by itself, with beer, or eat it over a bed of lettuce.",
