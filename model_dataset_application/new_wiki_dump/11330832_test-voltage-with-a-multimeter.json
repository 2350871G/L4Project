An alternating current (AC) setting is often labeled with a V and a squiggly line or initials like ACV. Turn the dial to the type of current you plan on measuring. DC is common in batteries and other low-voltage sources of power. AC is used in buildings, electronics, and anything else that requires multiple currents."

          "description":"On some multimeters, you will see a bunch of numbers around the dial. If yours has these numbers, refer to the electronic device you are testing or check the user manual for the normal voltage it is supposed to have. Then, set the multimeter dial to the next highest setting. Estimating the voltage this way makes the test result more accurate. For example, if you have a 12V battery, test it using the 20V setting. Using any settings beyond that would lead to a less accurate result. Most modern multimeters are autorange, meaning they set the proper range once you begin the test. If you\u2019re not sure what voltage setting to use, start at the highest one. Work your way back until you get an accurate result. The voltage readout will change to 1 if you go too far."

          "description":"Every multimeter has a red and black probe. The black probe always fits into the COM port on the front of the multimeter, so insert that one first. The remaining ports, marked 10A and mAV\u03a9, are meant for the red plug. Choose the one that fits the kind of current you plan on testing. The mAV\u03a9 port is meant for currents rated at 200 milliamps (mA). In most cases, you will end up using this port. Use the 10A port to test strong currents greater than 200 mA. If you don\u2019t know the strength of the current you are testing, plug the red probe into the 10A port to avoid damaging the multimeter."

Then, touch the tip of the red probe to the opposite terminal or end of the circuit. The multimeter\u2019s display will change as the current flows through it. To get accustomed to using a multimeter, test it on a battery. Hold the black probe against the negative terminal and the red probe against the positive one. If you\u2019re attempting to test live wires, find the screws pinning the wires in place. Touch the black probe to one screw and the red probe to another. Be careful to avoid touching active wires or metal parts, since it could lead to an electrical shock. Also, the multimeter could short-circuit if you bump the metal tips of the probes together."

If you\u2019re not sure what the test subject\u2019s normal voltage is supposed to be, turn the dial down gradually until get an accurate result. If you set the voltage too low, the multimeter will display 1. The multimeter range has to be set to the correct maximum voltage for the circuit in order to get the most accurate result possible. If it is set too high, it will have a hard time detecting the voltage of a weaker current. If the multimeter displays a negative number, for example, the probes are most likely in the wrong place. Reverse them so that the electrical current flows properly between them. If you don\u2019t see any readout, the circuit may not be receiving any electrical power at all. Test the multimeter on something active, such as a battery or outlet, to make sure it still works."
