Use cedar if allowed in your area as it does not change size very much through temperature changes. Rafters and trim require wood to be cut at a 45\u00b0 angle. For this you will need a miter. Remember the adage \"measure twice, cut once.\" Take your time cutting your materials to avoid wasting time and money. Alternatively, many major home supply stores offer lumber cutting services. Take your plans with you and have the cuts made in the store when you purchase the materials. Besides the wood, you will need several pounds of nails, roof tacks for the shingles, hinges for the doors, and prefabricated windows for the walls. You will also need gussets (triangle pieces of wood) for the rafters."

Call an excavator if the build site is beyond your capacity to prepare. The average shed can be supported by a foundation of concrete blocks or pressure-treated wood skids. Use solid concrete blocks for the foundation. Larger sheds will require a permanent concrete foundation much like a house. You will need to contact your local building department to find out the precise foundation requirements for your area. Use pressure-treated lumber, especially in the foundation. Treated lumber will resist rotting much more than untreated. For a solid, rigid floor use 3/4\" pressure-treated Tongue and Groove plywood. The plywood locks together, and the pressure treatment prevents rot from excess moisture. You may need to install floor joints to support plywood. If possible, build your shed several inches above the ground to allow air and water to pass underneath. This will add to the longevity of your shed."

A basic wall frame is composed of 2x4 studs evenly spaced along the frame every 16 to 24 inches (40 to 60 cm). Window holes require extra smaller studs to support it. Attach the siding to the frame while it is lying flat. It will be much easier to attach the large piece before you raise the frames up.

Avoid building the shed in a low area of the yard where moisture collects, and always install a proper drainage system. The ground around your shed will always be soggy. Moisture can also rot wood, rust hinges, and deteriorate whatever you're storing. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/58\\/Build-a-Storage-Shed-Step-5Bullet3-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Build-a-Storage-Shed-Step-5Bullet3-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/58\\/Build-a-Storage-Shed-Step-5Bullet3-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Build-a-Storage-Shed-Step-5Bullet3-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nGround angle. You want your shed to be as level as possible. Adjust the ground yourself if you have to by digging out the flat spot and filling in any holes. If the ground cannot be leveled, you will need to build your foundation so that the structure will still be flat. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f1\\/Build-a-Storage-Shed-Step-5Bullet4-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Build-a-Storage-Shed-Step-5Bullet4-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f1\\/Build-a-Storage-Shed-Step-5Bullet4-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Build-a-Storage-Shed-Step-5Bullet4-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nSurrounding trees. Try to leave a few feet of space on all sides of the shed. This will make the shed easier to access and reduce the growth of mold and mildew. Build your shed in direct sunlight if possible to further reduce growth. Assemble your tools and cut your lumber. The average 8'x8' shed will require almost 100 pieces of wood precisely cut to construct. Use cedar if allowed in your area as it does not change size very much through temperature changes. Rafters and trim require wood to be cut at a 45\u00b0 angle. For this you will need a miter. Remember the adage \"measure twice, cut once.\" Take your time cutting your materials to avoid wasting time and money. Alternatively, many major home supply stores offer lumber cutting services. Take your plans with you and have the cuts made in the store when you purchase the materials. Besides the wood, you will need several pounds of nails, roof tacks for the shingles, hinges for the doors, and prefabricated windows for the walls. You will also need gussets (triangle pieces of wood) for the rafters. Constructing the Shed Lay your foundation. Without a solid foundation, the shed will not last. Level the ground as much as possible. Clear any rocks or protruding roots. Fill in any potholes. Call an excavator if the build site is beyond your capacity to prepare. The average shed can be supported by a foundation of concrete blocks or pressure-treated wood skids. Use solid concrete blocks for the foundation. Larger sheds will require a permanent concrete foundation much like a house. You will need to contact your local building department to find out the precise foundation requirements for your area. Use pressure-treated lumber, especially in the foundation. Treated lumber will resist rotting much more than untreated. For a solid, rigid floor use 3/4\" pressure-treated Tongue and Groove plywood. The plywood locks together, and the pressure treatment prevents rot from excess moisture. You may need to install floor joints to support plywood. If possible, build your shed several inches above the ground to allow air and water to pass underneath. This will add to the longevity of your shed. Build your walls. Start by constructing the frames for the two side walls. Afterwards, construct the front and back frame, with a space for the door in the front. If you are putting in windows, be sure to construct the frame accordingly. The window must be supported on all sides by 2x4s. A basic wall frame is composed of 2x4 studs evenly spaced along the frame every 16 to 24 inches (40 to 60 cm). Window holes require extra smaller studs to support it. Attach the siding to the frame while it is lying flat. It will be much easier to attach the large piece before you raise the frames up. Once both side walls are completed, raise them up so that they are 90\u00b0 to the foundation. Hold them up for the time being with planks nailed to both the foundation and the wall frames. Raise the two remaining walls. Attach them to the roof and the two side walls. Install the door in the spot made in the front wall. Install prefabricated windows in the windows spots in your side walls. Build the roof. After the two side walls are raised, connect them by building the rafters and roof. The rafters continue up from the studs in the wall. Build each rafter truss (the triangle construction of the rafter) separately, using the first completed one as a template for the others. When attached, the bottom of the rafter should be flush with the siding. Once the rafters are all attached, cover the roof frame with decking material. Then, shingle the roof. There are multiple different patterns you can use when shingling a roof. It is recommended that you follow the manufacturer's specification for shingle placement. Putting on the Finishing Touches Paint or stain your wood. To help protect your new shed against weather, you should paint or stain it. Use the same paint that your house was painted with if you wish to make the shed match the look of your house. If you don't want them to match, pick a color from the same family so that the shed and the house complement each other. A clear stain will keep the shed's rustic appeal by not covering up the wood construction while still protecting it from the elements. Use either a sprayer or paint roller, with a hand brush for details and trim. Wire the shed for electricity. If you plan to use the shed as a workshop, or want to put a refrigerator or freezer in it, then the shed will need to be wired for electricity. WARNING: Wiring electricity is extremely hazardous if you do not take all the necessary precautions. It is highly recommended that you hire a professional electrician. You will also need a permit and inspection beforehand.",
