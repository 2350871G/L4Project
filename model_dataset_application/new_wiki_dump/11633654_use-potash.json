          "description":"In many types of plants, a potassium deficiency will cause the edges of leaves near the bottom of the plant to turn yellow or brown. Over time, the leaves higher up on the plant will also be affected. Get your soil tested for a potassium deficiency if you notice these distinctive symptoms in your plants. In alfalfa plants, you might notice white or yellow spots appearing around the edges of older leaves. Potassium deficiency is especially hard on potato plants in the summer, when the tubers start bulking up. You might notice the leaves turning brown and shriveling at the edges, and the vines will eventually start to die back."

          "description":"Getting a soil test is the most reliable way to know if you need to add potash to your soil. Use a clean trowel, spade, or soil probe to collect 6-8 samples of soil from the affected area. When collecting the samples, try to dig down at least 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) deep. Combine the samples together in a clean plastic bucket and mix them thoroughly. Contact your local agricultural extension office for instructions about how to package the soil sample and submit it for testing. If you don\u2019t have an agricultural extension office in your area, you may be able to get your soil tested by a local nursery or horticultural society. Get your soil tested if you suspect a potassium deficiency in your established crop or garden, or if you\u2019re preparing to plant an area and want to check the nutrient balance first. In the U.S., a basic soil test costs about $7-10 for one sample.Tip: Most of the time, you should get your test results within 1-2 weeks. However, it might take longer for you to get your results during the late fall through early spring, since there\u2019s more demand for soil testing during those times."

If the tests indicate that there\u2019s not enough potassium in the soil for your plants, get a potash or high-K fertilizer and apply it according to the recommendations in the test results. If you\u2019re not sure how to interpret the test results, contact a horticulture specialist or talk to someone at your local agricultural extension office. Different types of plants need different amounts of potassium in the soil. In general, however, your plants will benefit from a potassium boost if your soil\u2019s potassium content is 80 ppm (parts per million) or lower. The test results should include recommendations about when to apply the fertilizer and how much to use within a given area."

To prevent your fruit from being spoiled by fungus, add potash fertilizer to the soil around the trees in late winter and early spring, when new leaves and flowers are starting to emerge. Many fruit trees can benefit from monthly potash treatments in winter and spring. Check with a plant specialist at your local nursery or agricultural extension office for more guidance on the specific needs of your trees."

          "description":"Use your soil test result recommendations as a guide to determine how much potash you need to apply to a given area. For example, your results might recommend that you use 0.8 pounds (0.36 kg) of potassium per 1,000 square feet (93 m) in your garden. Calculate the area of your garden and the amount of potassium in your fertilizer to figure out how much to apply.Tip: If you\u2019re using an N-P-K fertilizer, figuring out the amount you need based on the ratio of nutrients in the fertilizer can be tricky. To make it easier, try using a fertilizer management calculator like the ones available here: http://soiltesting.tamu.edu/webpages/calculator.html. You can find the area of your garden by multiplying its length by its width. Multiply the amount of potash you need per 1,000 square feet (93 m) by the area of your garden divided by 1000. If you have a 200 sq ft (19 m) garden, you\u2019d need 0.8 pounds (0.36 kg) of potash X \u20441000 square foot (0.0186 m) = 0.16 pounds (0.073 kg) of potash. A 0-0-60 fertilizer is 60% potash and 40% filler, so you\u2019ll need to do another calculation to figure out how much of the fertilizer to apply. Divide the amount of potash you need by the percentage in your fertilizer. For example, 0.16/.6 = 0.27 pounds (0.12 kg) of your 0-0-60 fertilizer for a 200 sq ft (19 m) garden."

The easiest way to apply it is with a fertilizer broadcaster, a wheelbarrow-like device that spreads the fertilizer onto the soil. Take care to spread the fertilizer evenly, moving in 2 different directions so that you get good coverage across the area. While some gardeners and farmers recommend tilling potash into the soil to get it closer to the root zone, it is typically cheapest and easiest to apply it to the surface of the soil."
