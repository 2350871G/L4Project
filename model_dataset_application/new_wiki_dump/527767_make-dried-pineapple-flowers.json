  "text":" Making Simpler Flowers Preheat the oven to 225\u00baF or 110\u00baC.  Place a few pieces of parchment or wax paper on 2 baking sheets.  Cut the pineapple ends off and then cut the skin off.  Use a melon baller or vegetable peeler and remove or pluck the \"eyes\" off of the pineapple.  Lay the pineapple down horizontally and cut it into very thin slices.  Place the slices on the lined baking sheets.  Bake the pineapple slices for about 1 to 2 hours or until they appear to be dry.  Flip them over with tongs and place them back in the oven for another hour.  Let the pieces cool on a cooling rack for a few hours.  Wait until the pieces are cooled. Use a small metal flower-shaped cookie cutter and press it down onto each pineapple slice. Press down firmly with a rolling pin. Place them back on the cooling rack. Wait until they're drier but still \"workable\" or flexible. Hold the center of a pineapple slice between your forefinger and thumb. Use your free hand to \"mold\" the petals towards you or upwards. This will make the flower look more realistic. Repeat the molding for the rest of the pineapple pieces.  Place the pieces in an airtight container. Store and use within 3 days. Creating More Realistic Flowers Slice the pineapple very thinly so the slices are almost transparent. Be more careful with these slices as they may burn more easily if not watched or flipped every now and than. Once the slices are shrunken and almost completely dried out, transfer them to a muffin tin so that the edges curve upward in the shape of a flower. It's recommended you let them sit overnight in order to let them retain the flower shape.",
