  "text":" Preparing Your Tofu Take your tofu out of the package. Tofu is usually sold in square loaves soaked in water. You will need to set it on a stack of paper towels, press another stack of paper towels on top of it. On top of all of that, place a soup can or a book. Get your supplies and ingredients ready.  In one bowl, pour soy sauce to fill up approximately three quarters of the bowl. Keep in mind that you do not have to fill up the entire bowl.

This tofu is meant to be flavorful, not sickeningly salty. Set the bowls by a frying pan filled with vegetable oil or canola oil. Make sure your tofu is dry enough to cut. Unwrap your tofu and put the damp paper towels in the trash. Place the tofu horizontally in front of you. Cut the tofu into five or six strips. Cut each strip into thirds.

It is okay if your tofu squares are still a little damp. Place the tofu on a plate and bring them over to the bowl of cornstarch, bowl of soy sauce, and the frying pan. Frying Your Tofu Set your frying pan with the oil on a low heat.  Dip the first square of tofu in the soy sauce. You could dip it in the soy sauce for only a hint of flavor or leave it in for a while for a more pronounced flavor. The longer that your tofu is in the soy sauce, the saltier it will taste. Put the tofu that has been in the soy sauce into the cornstarch. Cover the whole piece with cornstarch. Place the tofu into the frying pan.
