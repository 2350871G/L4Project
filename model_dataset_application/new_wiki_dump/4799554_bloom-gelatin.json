For best results, strain dissolved gelatin and liquid through a fine chinois/sieve, refrigerate and let cool until set. Blooming from Powder Measure required amount of gelatin powder needed in recipe.  Gently sprinkle powdered gelatin over some of the cold water or liquid requested in the recipe. Let the gelatin dissolve. Use hot liquid to incorporate the now bloomed gelatin and blooming liquid into the recipe using a whisk.
