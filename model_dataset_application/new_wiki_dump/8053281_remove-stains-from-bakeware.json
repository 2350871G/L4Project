          "description":"The amount of baking soda and soap you\u2019ll need depends on the size of your dish. The best way to gauge how much baking soda you\u2019ll need is to just sprinkle a light, even coating of baking soda across the bottom. The best way to gauge how much soap you\u2019ll need is to squirt your liquid soap along the inner edge of the pan, then apply three or four evenly spaced stripes of soap from one end of the pan to the other. Use an antibacterial liquid soap. This method also works on enameled bakeware like ceramics. When cleaning enameled bakeware, use one quart of water and two tablespoons of baking soda for your mixture. You shouldn\u2019t need soap."

If you have a lot of water in the pan, you might end up with a big mess later when you scrub it, since the water might splash back. Wait 15 minutes for the baking soda, soap (if cleaning glass or Pyrex), and water to mix and loosen the grime on the glass bakeware."

          "description":"After 15 minutes, your pan is ready for cleaning. Place the dish in the sink so that any water that splashes up over the sides of the dish will drain down the sink. Depending on the severity of the stain, you might use a regular dish sponge, a green scrubbing pad, steel wool, or even a toothbrush. Use vigorous circular motions to remove the stains. Some people like to use balled-up aluminum foil to scrub stains off their glass bakeware. Add more baking soda to spots that are especially stained. Don\u2019t be discouraged if your stain doesn\u2019t come out immediately. It often takes several passes for stained glass bakeware to look truly clean again. Some people advise giving the dish a preliminary scrubbing, letting it sit for 30 minutes in soapy water, then going at it again. Once you\u2019ve removed the stain, wash and rinse your bakeware out with soap and warm water."

The larger the surface, the more baking soda you\u2019ll need. Then, add some vinegar to the pan. Again, the amount of vinegar you add should be proportional to the surface area of the stainless steel bakeware. Start with \u00bc cup of vinegar. If that isn\u2019t enough to evenly coat the bottom of the tray, add more in one-tablespoon increments. When you mix the vinegar and baking soda, you\u2019ll notice them fizzing.

Place the tray in the sink face-up and slowly pour the boiling water over it. Don\u2019t pour the boiling water too rapidly or you risk splashing it onto your skin. Wait a few minutes for the hot water to cool, then start scrubbing with soap and water to loosen up as much of the stain as you can. Use vigorous circular motions with the sponge or scrubbing pad to loosen the grime. If you can remove the stain completely at this point, great! If not, continue on to the next step."

          "headline":"Heat water and vinegar in the bakeware.",
          "description":"Prepare a mixture of one part vinegar to three parts water. For instance, you could mix one cup of vinegar and three cups of water. Or, for more shallow trays, you might mix half a cup of vinegar with 1\u00bd cups of water. Bring the mixture to a boil in your bakeware. If you have a deep pot, this is easy to do on the stovetop. However, if you\u2019re cleaning a shallow bakeware item like a tray or cookie sheet, you\u2019ll need to add a thin layer of this mixture and heat it in the oven to about 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) inside your oven. Once the mixture is boiling, turn off the heat. Let it cool for 10-15 minutes. Then dump the mixture down your sink and give the stainless steel bakeware a good scrubbing with soap and water. Any stains should come right out."

          "headline":"Use baking soda and water.",
          "description":"If your stainless steel bakeware is still stained after using the vinegar and water mix, mix baking soda and water in equal parts. For instance, you could mix \u00bd a cup of water and \u00bd a cup of baking soda. The mixture should resemble a thick paste. Coat the stains on your stainless steel bakeware with this paste and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Then, rub the paste away with a sponge and give the bakeware a good washing with hot, soapy water. Some people find that scrubbing the baking soda paste away with aluminum foil helps remove the stain. You could also soak a sponge in vinegar to help you remove stains treated with the baking soda paste. Use this vinegar-soaked sponge to scrub away the paste or after you\u2019ve washed the pan with soapy water. This method is also effective when cleaning cast iron bakeware. However, it is recommended that you let the paste coat the stain on cast iron for closer to eight hours rather than just 15 minutes."
