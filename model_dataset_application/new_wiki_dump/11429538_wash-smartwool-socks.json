          "description":"Reach inside each of your socks and grab them from the inside of the fabric. Pull the edge of each sock away from you while holding the inside to turn them inside out. Since the fabric on the inside of your socks is more resilient than the stitching on the outside, turning your socks inside out when you wash them will preserve them for a longer period of time.Tip: Smartwool socks are made out of Merino wool\u2014a softer and thinner fabric than traditional wool. Merino wool is excellent at absorbing odor-causing bacteria, so you can wear your Smartwool socks several times before you need to need to wash them. Using a washing machine is the preferred method according to the manufacturer."

          "description":"Feel free to simply wash your Smartwool socks alongside your other laundry. There\u2019s no need to separate them or wash them alone. However, you can wash your Smartwool socks separately if you don\u2019t have any other laundry that you want to wash on the gentle cycle in cold water. Place your Smartwool socks in the washing machine. If you choose to wash your socks with your other laundry, consider putting them in a laundry bag to avoid getting the fabric caught on a zipper or button. You should still separate your laundry. Wash white socks with white clothing and darker socks with your colors."

          "description":"If you\u2019re washing your socks with other clothes, use the measuring cap that comes with your laundry detergent to determine how much soap you need to add to the drum. If you\u2019re washing the socks on their own, add \u20442\u20132 tablespoons (7.4\u201329.6 mL) of mild detergent to your washing machine depending on how many pairs of socks you\u2019re washing. Do not use bleach or fabric softener. Bleach will permanently destroy your socks. Fabric softener will coat the Merino fibers with residue, which will make them less breathable in the future."

On some machines, this setting is labelled \u201cdelicates\u201d or \u201clow power.\u201d Turn the dial until the indicator is pointing at the lowest-power setting available. Turn the knob to set your water temperature to cold. Run your washing machine to wash your socks. If you wash your Smartwool socks on high heat, you may shrink them. There are other Smartwool products, like some of their sweaters, that can be washed with warm water. Read the tag on each of their individual products to find care instructions."

Handwashing your socks ensures that your socks maintain their shape and that no loose threads unravel in the machine. This is a good option if you have other small, wool products that require hand washing and you want to clean all of your wool at once."

Fill your sink with enough water to completely cover your socks. Get a mild laundry detergent to clean your socks. Depending on how many socks you\u2019re washing, your bathroom sink may be too small for this and you may need to do this in the kitchen.
