  "text":" Folding the Jumperoo Locate the release button. The Jumperoo has a button at the base of one of the legs that, when pressed, allows the whole Jumperoo to be taken apart. Find this button. Press the release button. As you press the release button, one of the base tubes should detach from the leg. Fold the detached base tubes toward the center. The legs should fold into one another. Think of this as if you are closing a book, and the legs and base tubes are the covers. They should come together neatly. At the end of this step, the base tubes should resemble an oval with pointed ends. Turn or collapse the seat sideways. This will happen as you fold the base tubes in on themselves, but you should also guide the seat as the tubes are collapsing. The seat should hang perpendicular to the floor.

Take care to look over the instruction manual if possible. Storing the Jumperoo Put the Jumperoo in a closet or other narrow space. When it is completely folded up, the Jumperoo is much skinnier than when it is set up.
