You will need to enter and there won\u2019t be lights without electricity. Check to make sure all utilities except the phone are off and ask for them to be winterized to prevent damage. Remember that after the fire, some plastic parts that are exposed to water may need replacement due to leaking and caused by changes in the pH of the water that affects the plastic parts. Examples are toilets, water pumps, etc. Remember that the stress can build without you realizing it. A great stress reliever is exercise, but remember to warm up your muscles since the stress can easily cause them to be pulled. Consult information on line \u2013use the local library if you lost your computer. Access information from the Better Business Bureau, Angie\u2019s List, and internet searches on your construction company. Consult insurance adjusters and run the same searches. Anyone can have a token reference basis \u2013 do more investigative research and don\u2019t sign a long term contract without your own research. Access advice from the Red Cross website. Your computer will be your best friend so replace it quickly. You will need it to do all types of searches for knowledge in areas you never had to know, construction information and house selections, to name a few. Don\u2019t worry about thanking others right away. Keep a running notebook in the car of your to-do list and carry it with you at all times. Cash Flow You will get an initial check from your insurance company to handle immediate needs for food and clothing. Everything must be documented by a receipt starting at the onset. Keep envelopes for receipts in each category of expense \u2013 housing, temporary living expenses, contents replacement, and reconstruction. As you submit receipts, keep a typed copy of each submittal and a copy of the receipts for your own files. Keep a notebook of the categories separated by tabs that holds the paperwork for the submittal \u2013receipts and listing. Provide submissions in accordance with your needs for reimbursement \u2013 this may vary by month or frequency of outlays. Initially, a monthly expense statement may be submitted. Once temporary living expenses settle down, then the submittals may become more infrequent and be based on dollar volume. You are eligible to receive some portion of your contents allowance. Some companies provide this upfront; others make you wait six months for it. It is critical that you understand your insurance company\u2019s policy for temporary living expenses. Does your company offer a flat allowance/limit for all expenses or an unlimited allowance for two years? Your expenses will be deducted for the normal living expenses that you would incur without a fire, such as typical food expenses for both eating at home and eating out, and utility expenses. The utility companies (electric, oil, gas) can provide you with the last 12 months of invoices for your home that can create an average expense. You are free to use your own realtors or set of contacts to locate suitable housing. You are free to find suitable temporary hotel accommodations for you and your family members such that you are not situated in a flea bag hotel or four persons sharing one room. You are free to dine where you normally would dine. You are free to shop where you normally would shop. Do not abuse the circumstances by dining at a four star restaurant every night nor feel intimidated in purchasing a safe and adequate level of requisites for your needs in terms of housing and food. Recognize at the onset that all expenses will be borne by you without regard to a timely repayment of those expenses unless you mandate that the insurance company purchase the higher priced goods directly or pay you in advance. This is the whole waiting game of the insurance industry and its Achilles heel. If the insurance company wants to have the necessary appliances repurchased by you, then submit to them the bill and state that they can directly pay for it or provide you the check in advance. This same argument may be made for all types of things including pre-purchase of utility rates/contracts, hotel expenses and major temporary living expenses, and larger repurchases relative to items needed to replace or reconstruct your home/contents. Unless you have an extra $50,000 to $100,000 in liquid assets that does not require your usage for a year or two, this will be necessary. Transfer whatever contents you can to use in your temporary conditions such as kitchen cookware, dishes, utensils and the like. For any repurchases such as electrical appliances (hairdryers, coffee pots, etc.) remember to buy the quality that you will need when you are placed back into the house. There is not an allowance for any temporary appliances. Make sure you understand how the fire is reported. Get a copy of your local fire report. Ask your agent how it is \u201cmarked\u201d on the file. This may affect your ability to be covered in the future. Construction Tidbits Be sure to have a written contract that states that substitutions for preexisting materials cannot be made without prior written approval and dissemination of information. Also, state contractually that no additional obligations will be incurred without prior written quotation and approval for any upgrade or change. Contractors could charge you whatever rates they would like for any deviation or nuance otherwise. Some families have spent tens of thousands of dollars and never realized that they would owe a dime since it was a one-for-one replacement in their eyes. Have a written contract that mandates that all materials will be installed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s warranty instructions, unless information is disseminated and approved in writing on an exception basis by the homeowner. Otherwise, all those new warranties are made futile and not enforceable. Thus, place this onus squarely on the contractor. You are eligible in most cases to receive services within your county of jurisdiction so that you need not be pressured into working with vendors that are far away or areas that do not represent your current level of quality and servicing. Thus, if you live in a nice suburb in Connecticut, you are not obligated to be serviced by a vendor that is located in a rat infested area of the Bronx or a company that is going out of business. (Don\u2019t laugh\u2014it happens!) The construction company will show you (if you hire them directly) or the insurance company (if it is one of their preferred suppliers) a proposal for reconstruction. This needs to be carefully checked for the specifications listed. Remember that there are critical aspects that can make huge differences in your cost and values that you may not normally evaluate. Interior and exterior doors can vary widely be width, style, solid wood/hollow/ or particle board filled, finish, etc.\u2014check the details and ask the construction firm to walk through the proposal on-site with you. Ask to see any items in the proposal that are important to you before construction. The proposal is based on the construction firm\u2019s quotation of materials; they should be able to show you the actual material proposed either on-line or on-site at the location inclusive of doors, windows, cabinetry, etc. Do not approve the proposal without seeing the larger elements or the details in advance of the manufacturer, selection, etc. Do not allow the contractor to tell you that you cannot access the information yet for any reason \u2013 or that it doesn\u2019t exist. If they have quoted it, then it exists on paper and they must be made to be forthcoming. Ask for a schedule of their activities in a rough approximation. Insist that any selections by you that are needed must be outlined at least two weeks in advance to allow proper timing and consideration. Carefully document your selections in writing to avoid any misunderstanding. Consider an appliance worksheet (example in appendix) that notates the previous appliance and selected replacement inclusive of model numbers and styles. E-mail is a great expedient way to confirm choices in written form. This makes the  contractor liable for the informed choice/selection and also makes you liable for the clarity of the decision. Any written selections that need further clarification should ask for them in writing. Many insurance contractors will advocate that they can \u201cmaster all trades\u201d and be the contractor for every aspect of the renovation. Their subcontractors are skilled in many disciplines such as carpentry, plumbing, flooring, painting, roofing and the like. Their skills and subcontractors may not lend themselves to being a complete expert in unique or more skilled areas such as placement of video cameras for security equipment and monitoring, hi-level stereo system design and installation, expert marble work, restoration of valuable antiques, or handling of unique areas of restoration that are not mainstream. These are areas where you might want to insist upon a separate entity by your designated selection to obtain the previous existing quality. Ask for the right upfront to be able to discuss needs with subcontractors as the work proceeds with the general contractor present.  Do not allow the contractor to put up an exterior lawn sign of his business in plain view of anyone riding or walking by, especially if it is a known national insurance contractor franchise. The reason is that these contractors all have a \u201cknown\u201d code to enter any and all of their homes, so any construction worker that ever worked on any project of theirs has now been given the \u201ckeys\u201d to your house. They can enter at any time, and the premise is not secure. If there are any contents of value, any appliances to be installed, or any installed items that are damaged, then the liability becomes an issue, not inclusive of any liability if the trespasser gets injured on your property. If your contractor states that some aspect of construction has a problem that has evolved, make sure to have the contractor take ownership of the recommended course of action to remedy the situation. Some contractors will advocate that you need to make the call of how to best remedy the leaking roof, for example. The right answer is that they are the general contractor and responsible for providing a dry roof. It is not your onus to understand and research the best construction techniques and make technical decisions \u2013 they own the liability for the decision. As you sign off on selections, make sure that you identify that you have signed for the selection in general but not the measurements or technical aspects of having the selection installed. For example, the windows and doors selections may include the type and brand, but the contractor is responsible for the measurement and proper fit. Again, this may seem obvious but some contractors will try to unload as much responsibility as possible. Don\u2019t fall for it. Insist that all workers be insured and free of prior convictions. Insist on a copy of the contractor\u2019s total coverage and make sure that it is adequate for your purposes. Get a mechanics waiver of lien prior to final payment for the reconstruction.  Consider having a construction management advisor for several visits as repairs proceed to double-check the work and quality.  The biggest damage afterwards from a fire is the damage from the water and potential mold that may takes years to creep in. Most reconstruction firms will have a caveat for this since they don\u2019t want to be held liable and your insurance firms are typically limiting their liability too. Pay particular attention to areas where water was displaced and how the area is being handled. You would prefer complete removal for these areas and new build./wood/materials.",
