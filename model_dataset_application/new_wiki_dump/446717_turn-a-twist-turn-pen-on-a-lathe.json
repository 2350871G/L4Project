  "text":" Preparation Mark the length of each brass tube.Be sure to add a little extra for inaccurate cutting and the kerf of the saw blade.  Make sure you keep the pattern running through the two pieces so that the final pen has a consistent pattern. This material has a random pattern that is more forgiving than the grain in some woods, but it is good practice to make a habit of this. Use a wood drill bit to drill holes through the length of the two pieces. Mark the centres on the matching ends of the two pieces so that the holes are not offset from each other or it will throw the pattern out and the two parts will not match. Use a medium grade abrasive to scratch the brass tubes in order for the glue to find purchase.  Glue the brass tubes into the blanks, making sure you push them in from the matching ends. Use liquid superglue as it provides the best holding strength and is quick acting. The acrylic must be at least the same length as the brass tube. Here the brass tube is quite a lot shorter than the acrylic outer.

The two images show the difference between sanded (600 grit) and polished finishes. Turning A small spindle gouge is used to get the pen blank round and remove the bulk of the material.  A small skew chisel is used to smooth the outer surface and bring it down close to the final diameter.  Sanding will complete the work on the lathe.

Alternate between sanding with the lathe on and then sanding lengthwise while the lathe is off. When sanding acrylics, you will find that a little water will aid in the process - just use care while working with water around electrical devices. Assembly Once both barrels have been turned from their square form to round and are complete, the parts can be assembled to make the pen. The diagram that comes with the pen parts describes the sequence of assembly. All of the components are squeezed together. You will need a vice with wooden jaws or a clamp with soft jaws to avoid damaging the parts of the pen. The front of the pen is pressed into the front end of the lower barrel. The only indication of which is the front before these are pressed together is the grain or pattern that runs through the two barrel parts. This is where you get to choose which end of the pen will be held and viewed more frequently. After the front of the pen is pressed fully into the barrel, the twist mechanism can be pushed into the rear of the same barrel to the point indicated by the arrow. If in doubt, compress the components together only a little at a time and check the depth my screwing the ink refill into this component until it twists to expose the writing tip. The depth that the twist mechanism is compressed to will determine how far the writing tip protrudes when the pen is in use. DO NOT compress the parts together with the ink refill in place as this will almost certainly destroy the refill. The brass ring can be placed on the twist mechanism before it is compressed into the barrel to the point where the indented ring meets the rear of the front or lower barrel. The brass ring has an interference fit on the rear of the twist mechanism that prevents it from falling off when the two final parts of the pen are separated. It should now be possible to push the rear barrel onto the twist mechanism by hand to give you an idea of what your final pen will look like. In the diagram on which the pen is photographed, steps 1, 2, and 3 are now complete. With the upper barrel removed from the twist mechanism, it is time to assemble the top of the pen. Which comprises the solid brass cap, the clip, and the remaining brass tube with the outer material turned and finished as desired. The cap is inserted through the ring of the clip and compressed into the top of the pen.  The three parts are compressed in a vice with wooden jaws. Pay attention to where the clip is positioned because it will be very difficult if not impossible to reposition it once the cap has been pressed into the barrel. The brass cap must be fully compressed into the barrel to hold the clip in place. The images shows that the clip has been positioned along a flowing line in the pattern. All that remains is to align the pattern or grain of the front and rear parts of the pen, and then to push the rear part of the pen onto the twist mechanism by hand to complete the pen.  The completed pen that is unique and something to be proud of. ",
