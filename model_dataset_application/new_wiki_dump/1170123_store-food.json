          "description":"\"First in, first out,\" also known as \"FIFO,\" is a common catchphrase used in restaurant kitchens to make sure that the food stays fresh, wherever it is stored. Restaurants go through so much product that every truck delivery usually means that there are only one or two items that have to be rotated forward. For the home cook, this means that canned goods, boxed goods, and other non-perishable supplies should be dated with the date bought. This ensures that a newer item isn't being opened first. Keep your cabinets, your refrigerator, and all your food storage spaces organized to make sure you know where everything is, and what's the most fresh. if you've got three open jars of peanut butter, something's going to spoil."

          "headline":"Store produce on the counter if it needs to ripen.",
          "description":"Fruit should be left to ripen on the counter, either out in the open or loosely in an open plastic bag to promote ripening. Once fruit has reached its desired level of ripeness, put it into the refrigerator to extend the life of the fruit. Bananas produce ethylene, which speeds up the ripening process of other fruits, so you can take advantage of this property and store them in a plastic bag together with a fruit that needs to ripen. This is an excellent technique for avocados as well. Never pack fruit into air-tight containers on the counter, or they will quickly spoil. Keep an eye out for signs of bruising or over-ripeness and remove rotten fruit quickly to avoid spoiling the rest. Be wary of fruit flies, which are attracted to fruit that's spoiled or in the the process of spoiling. Remnants should always be discarded quickly. If you develop a problem with fruit flies, start storing your fruit in the fridge."

          "description":"Rice, oatmeal, quinoa, and other dry grains can be kept in your kitchen cabinets in tight, sealed containers. Glass jars, plastic tupperware containers, and any other lidded storage is perfect for storing these bulk items in cabinets or on the counter. This goes for dried beans as well. If you store rice and other grains in plastic bags, be wary of meal worms. These can be perfectly fine ways of storing rice, but small holes can allow meal worms and moths to breed, ruining large amounts of food. It's always best to keep them in tightly sealed jars.

Kathryn Kellogg\t\t\tAuthor, 101 Ways to Go Zero Waste\t\t\t\tOpt for reusable containers over single-use boxes or bags to help reduce waste. There are tons of great reusable options for storing food. Unless you're traveling, I recommend keeping your food in a glass container like a mason jar or a glass bowl, because if you can see what's inside you'll be more likely to eat it. I also like mixing bowls with lids, because you can prepare the food in the mixing bowl, then you can just put on the lid and store it in the fridge, and you'll have less dishes to wash."

Bread on the counter, properly stored, should be good for 3-5 days, which extends to 7-14 days in the refrigerator. It's also fine to refrigerate or freeze bread, especially soft sandwich bread, to extend the life. If you live in a particularly humid place, soft breads will mold very quickly if left out, and bread is easy to defrost in the toaster. If you keep bread on the counter, never keep it in a plastic bag. This promotes mold."

Any food that is left out in these temperatures is susceptible bacteria growth which could lead to food-born illness. Always get cooked food put away as soon as possible. Check the temperature of your refrigerator regularly.

Soy sauce? Rule of thumb: If you buy something cold, it needs to stay in the refrigerator. Items like pickles, peanut butter, and soy sauce are fine to keep in the cabinet at room temperature until you open them, at which point they'll need to be refrigerated. Oil or vinegar-based items usually work this way. Refrigerate canned foods after opening. Anything, whether it be cooked ravioli or green beans, will need to be refrigerated after you open the can. You can store it in the can itself, or transfer it to a tight-lidded storage container for a closer seal."

The looser, the more likely the food is to stink up the fridge or take on other smells, but it's a perfectly fine way of keeping leftovers, once they've cooled to room temperature. After food is cooked, transfer it to a larger shallow container instead of a smaller deeper container for storage. The larger container will ensure uniform cooling over a shorter period of time. Meat and food items that contain meat need to be cooled to room temperature before putting it in the refrigerator. If you place hot meat in a covered container and then immediately into the fridge, the condensation will make the meat spoil much more quickly than normal."

If you can't get through your leftovers fast enough, consider freezing what's left and defrosting it at a leaner time, when there's less in the fridge. Raw meat always needs to be refrigerated, kept separate from cooked meat and other products, by wrapping it loosely in plastic wrap in the refrigerator. Watch closely for signs of spoilage. Spoiled meat will turn slightly gray or brown and give off an unpleasant odor."

Keep tomatoes out of the fridge unless they have been sliced. In the fridge, their insides turn watery and it shortens their shelf life.

Frozen vegetables are easy to throw right into soups, stews, and stir-frys, making it an excellent way of managing leftover produce items. To blanch vegetables, cut them into bite-sized pieces and dip quickly into salted boiling water. No more than a minute or two, and immediately take them from the boiling water into a waiting bath of icy water to shock them and stop them from cooking. They should still be firm, but partially cooked. Place portion-sized amounts of vegetables into freezer bags and label and date them. Allow the vegetables to cool completely before freezing."
