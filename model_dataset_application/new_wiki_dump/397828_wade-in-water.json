          "description":"Before entering a body of water, approximate how deep it is by reading the land around it. If the shoreline sits just above the edge of the water and gently slopes down into it, the area is shallow and most likely safe to wade through. If cliffs or high ledges surround the water, the area is deep and may not be safe to enter. Some bodies of water may be shallow in 1 spot and deep in another. As a general rule, avoid wading through water that goes higher than your waist. For safety, do not wade through water that reaches up to your chest."

If the object starts to move, walk along the bank to try and keep up with it. If you have to jog or run to match the object\u2019s speed, the water current may be too fast to wade through safely."

For safety, pick out 1 or 2 additional exit points in case you can\u2019t get to the first. You may have to alter these plans based on the area\u2019s actual terrain. If the water you wish to cross has a strong current, try making a path that goes across the current so you\u2019re not facing upstream or downstream."
