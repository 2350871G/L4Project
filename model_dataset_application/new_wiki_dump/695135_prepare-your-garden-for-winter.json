You\u2019ll want to research the specific plants you have in your garden and find out which ones can be easily moved inside for the winter. You could move them to a greenhouse, your garage, or even inside. If you do this, you\u2019ll need to carefully dig them up and replant them into an appropriate pot. Most pepper plants can be brought inside and will still grow for a while into winter. Make sure you clean off the plants so no bugs travel inside. Some other plants that can be brought inside are Aloe, Citrus, Geraniums, Impatiens, and Rosemary."

A good leaf blower and mulcher saves a lot of time here. You can begin a temporary compost pile off to the side of your garden as you prepare in the weeks leading up to winter, or you can store compost matter in a trash can or bin until you are ready to use it."

          "description":"Perennials are plants that grow for more than two seasons, but they are not active during the winter. They go into a period of dormancy. You can help them grow fresh again in the spring by cutting them down to the level of the soil. The root of the plant will remain and bloom again in spring. You can leave any seeds that are present for birds to eat during the winter. Common perennials include Lilies, Black-Eyed Susans, Lavender, Ferns, and Primrose."

You can put all of this into a bin to add as compost later on. Dead plant matter can harbor disease or insects that will later kill your plants. Removing all of this from the garden protects it for new growth in the spring. If you notice obvious diseased or infested plant matter, burn this separately and don\u2019t include in your compost. Some people may feel that it\u2019s easier to leave the old plants to die in the winter, but this can end up causing your garden to be worse off. The effort it takes to clear out the old plants will pay off by preserving your garden\u2019s health."

If you get heavy snow, you may considered building a cover to keep all that snow off your garden. If you have pretty mild winters, you may not need to do all that much for the garden. For this and many other garden issues, talking to people around you who garden can be really helpful. If you can find anyone in your area who has been gardening for years, they will know how local winter weather affects gardens."

These types of plants help keep the microbes of the soil active while other plants are in dormancy. These crops are usually tilled over in the spring to mix back into the soil as more compost."

A soil test can tell you the pH of your soil and relative levels of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur, which are important for healthy growth. A test can also tell you how much organic matter is present and about the lead content. You can search online or a local business directory to find garden stores near you, and you can call to see what soil testing options they have. At the very least, you can buy pretty simple home testing kits which should give you the basic information you need. Many county extension offices have departments that you can contact to find out if they are able to test soil. pH adjusting treatments like lime take a few months to work into the soil, so applying them in the winter helps ensure the soil will be adjusted by spring for planting."

As this stuff decomposes during winter, it keeps some of the moisture in the soil during the dry times of winter. Even though not much is growing, composting during the winter will keep the soil healthier. If you have enough compost matter, 1-2 inches is a good thickness for a layer of compost. If you don\u2019t have much compost to work with, you can lay it only on the rows where you actually plant crops, leaving walking rows and the edges of the garden without compost."

          "description":"Much like compost, mulch helps protect the soil from erosion, temperature changes, and animals. While the compost will nourish the soil during the dormant period, mulch is sort of a way to cover the compost and keep it protected. Common mulch options include peat moss, bark, sawdust, and shredded newspapers. While you probably can\u2019t avoid the ground freezing if you live somewhere with consistently low winter temperatures, the compost and mulch layers help keep the ground temperature regulated against multiple freezes and thaws. Mulch and compost serve similar purposes, so if your options are limited, you can go with just mulch. Otherwise, you can lay the mulch down on top of the compost. These can also help attract earthworms, which work to improve your soil."
