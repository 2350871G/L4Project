          "description":"The number one key to staying in a healthy relationship when you\u2019re a vegan dating (or married to) a non-vegan, aka omnivore (or omni), is to avoid being judgmental of your partner. Most relationships can\u2019t sustain the constant criticism of one partner toward another. Make your commitment to veganism about you, not them. Don\u2019t give them the \u201cstink eye\u201d during meals, nag them to agree with your food choices, or criticize what they eat."

          "description":"Along with not being judgmental, you should remain open-minded and understanding of your partner\u2019s choice to remain omnivorous. Showing compassion instead of saying \u201cI told you so\u201d when your partner gets food poisoning from undercooked meat, or offering to cook meat for their meal, shows that you are willing to work with your partner."

          "headline":"Be thankful that your partner is accepting of your lifestyle choice.",
          "description":"If you are in a relationship with a non-vegan, this means that your partner is most likely open to your lifestyle choice. Be thankful that your partner likes you more than what you eat or what products you don\u2019t use. Express this thankfulness so that they know you feel it. Do things like give them cards with heartfelt sentiments of thanks, cook them an omnivore meal, or offer to go to a restaurant they like but you don\u2019t like."

          "headline":"Avoid trying to pressure or change your partner.",
          "description":"Just like in any relationship, pressuring your partner to change isn\u2019t a great idea. It expresses your displeasure with who they are, which makes them want to get away from you rather than stick around. Don\u2019t nag them to eat like you do. Some even suggest that the best way to recruit a romantic partner to becoming a vegan is to live by example only and not try to convert your partner at all."

          "headline":"Agree to disagree.",
          "description":"Enjoying your partner is an important part of any relationship. One way to do that when you are in relationship with someone who has chosen a different lifestyle is to agree to disagree. When differences of opinion arise at meal time or when purchasing cleaning products or furniture, laugh about your differences and choose something that you can both live with."

You probably both like white potatoes, watching TV together, and working out at the gym. Look for activities that are neutral (neither vegan nor non-vegan) and do those more often than either vegan or non-vegan ones."

It is much easier to accept the differences of others when you understand their reason behind it. You may have chosen to be vegan for environmental reasons, or to improve your health. Whatever your reason, make sure your partner clearly understands it. People also choose to become vegan because of ethical reasons.
