They\u2019ll also keep your hands from smelling like the fruit, which some people find unpleasant. Finally, the gloves will also help you hold the durian steady as you cut into it. You can use thick rubber gloves, clean gardening gloves, a baseball mitt, or even a clean towel to protect your hands."

Cut off the stem and a small sliver from the top of the shell. Turn the durian over and rest it on the cut edge. Cutting a sliver from the top of the fruit will give you an even edge to rest the durian on as you cut into it."

As such, the durian will have seams where the shell comes together, and you can open the fruit easily by locating and cutting the seams. The seams of a ripe durian will actually start to tear apart on their own, so you may not even have to cut into the fruit."

Start with a shallow cut, and then cut progressively deeper until the sections of the shell start coming apart. Cut the entire length of the seam. Repeat with each seam in the shell. Cutting in progressively deeper slices will ensure you cut deeply enough to crack the shell, but not so deeply that you score the fruit underneath."
