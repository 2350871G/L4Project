In order to achieve the brightest, most lasting shade of pink, try Permanent Alizarin Crimson or Quinacridone red acrylics and mix them with Titanium White. Vermilion will produce a nice shade of pure pink.Use of a brick red will produce a muddier pink, closer to a peach.Darker reds such as Alizarin Crimson Hue make a pink color tinged with blue or purple,so they are good for shades such as magenta."

You can add more white to get a brighter and brighter tint, but every red has its own tint strength, so you'll eventually reach the limit to how pink you can make that particular red. The darker the red you used, the more white paint you will need to lighten it to pink. Try softening your pink with yellow to bring it closer to a peach or a salmon color. Add blue or violet to bring the pink closer to fuchsia or magenta."
