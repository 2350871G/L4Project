  "text":" Assembling Your Ingredients Choose the jar. A canning or pickling jar works well for this project. Make sure the jar has a lid. Check the jar for any damage or breakage. You\u2019ll be both freezing and baking with the jar so ensuring the jar is free of damage is imperative. Assemble ingredients for the pie dough. Any pie dough recipe will work well, however you can use a recipe that creates a thicker, sweeter dough. Purchase/pick up sugar, unsalted butter, all-purpose flour, salt and two eggs. Find your rolling pin and two sheets of parchment paper. Rolling the pie dough between two sheets of parchment paper will reduce the likelihood of the dough sticking and also creates a smoother dough. Determine how you\u2019d like to fill the pie. This is a personal choice as you may be more inclined (and depending on the season) to go for a blueberry or cherry pie. A pudding pie may be a possibility but only if you plan to make the pie sooner than later. Select your fruit. Assemble filling ingredients including sugar (white or brown), flour, unsalted butter and seasonings (depending upon the type of pie you plan to create this could include cinnamon, ginger, all spice, vanilla etc. ). Preparing the Pie Crust Dough Cream \u00be cup of sugar with \u00be cup of butter. If possible, use an electric mixer for best results. Mix butter at room temperature so it combines well with the sugar. Trying to mix cold butter can result in a lumpy dough. Cream butter and sugar until the mixture is white and fluffy. Add 1 \u00bd tsp. salt and 4 cups of all-purpose flour to the butter and sugar mixture. Slowly add the salt and flour, while keeping the mixture on a low setting. Avoid dumping everything in as it will be difficult to mix and could create a mess. Add 2 eggs, lightly beaten to the mixture and continue to mix until eggs are fully integrated into the dough.  Place one piece of the parchment paper on a clean flat surface and dust with flour. Add dough to the top of the parchment paper and sprinkle with flour. You will only need a small amount of flour as you don\u2019t want to integrate more flour into the dough. Cover dough with a second piece of parchment paper and begin rolling the dough out. Roll dough until it is approximately 3/16 inch (5 mm) thick and cut in eight sections. You will use one section to line your jar and the other section to top your pie. Gently place one section of dough inside an ungreased jar. Press against the sides of the jar to fill each side. Crimp edges and place dough topping aside while you make the pie filling. Making Apple Pie Mixture Combine 2 cups of freshly prepared fruit with 2 tbsp. of sugar, 2 tbsp. of flour and 1 tbsp. of unsalted butter. Toss fruit together gently until fully combined. Don't over combine as you could bruise the fruit. Add additional ingredients such as vanilla, lemon zest, cinnamon etc. Place pie filling in jars. Don\u2019t overfill jars but be sure you add a healthy portion of filling to each pie. Add a small pat of butter to the top of each pie. This will keep the pie moist and flavorful. Topping Pie With Dough Consider the statement you\u2019d like to create with the pie dough. In some cases you may want to do a simple criss-cross pattern or you could use small cookie cutters and top with small dough cookies instead. Make sure you create a pie dough topper with a slit or room to allow steam to seep out. If you plan to completely cover the top with dough, a simple slit or two on the top will suffice. Press the pie dough top down to ensure the jar lid still fits. Since you may be storing these little pies in the freezer you will need to firmly screw the lid on top. Brush each pie dough top with an egg wash or melted butter. Sprinkle each pie with sugar for extra sweetness. Freeze\\/Storing Pies Top each pie with a lid and screw tightly. Since you want to avoid freezer burn you\u2019ll want to make sure each lid is on well. Place pies in the freezer. These pies can be stored for up to six months in the freezer if well maintained. Consider placing the jars in a large freezer bag for storage. Reduce the possibility of your pies being \u201cinfected\u201d by freezer burn and place each jar (or two jars) in a large freezer bag before placing inside your freezer. Mark each pie with the type of pie and date made so you\u2019ll know exactly what you are getting when its time to eat. Baking and Eating Pies Remove frozen pies and allow to partially defrost for 30 minutes. The pies will not be completely defrosted but will get used to being in room temperature before baking. Remove lid and place on a baking sheet. Putting the pies on a baking sheet will allow you to catch any filling overspill and keep your oven clean. Place pies in a cold oven and then turn the heat to 375. While putting cold pies in a jar into a hot oven should not break the glass, placing them in a cold oven will reduce the likelihood of breakage. Bake pies for 50 to 60 minutes or until the tops are golden brown. If you are baking fresh pies (that haven\u2019t been previously frozen) you will only need to bake them for 45 minutes. Finished.
