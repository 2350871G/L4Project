This will make it easier to melt them in the milk to create the hot chocolate. White chocolate chips will add a sweet, creamy chocolate flavor to the drink. If you are willing to be patient and stir the white chocolate chips around in the milk to melt them, you can skip this step. But blending the white chocolate chips can speed up the making of the drink. To make the white chocolate chips easier to blend, put them in the freezer overnight.

Start with one teaspoon of dye and add more until you get a pink color you like. Stir the food dye around with a spoon to ensure the color is mixed in well. For a slightly vanilla flavor, you can also add in vanilla extract at this point, if you decide to use it."
