Keep your whiskey in a dark area, such as a wine cellar, cupboard, box, or darkened pantry. If you are a collector or retailer interested in showing off your bottles, keep in mind that exposure to direct sunlight will also cause the label to fade.

When whiskey gets hot, it expands in the bottle, which can eventually damage the seal and let in oxygen. Keep your whiskey in a cool, temperature-controlled room or container. Try to store your whiskey in an area where the temperature stays between 15 and 20\u00b0 C (59-68\u00b0 F).

Minimize your whiskey's exposure to oxygen by keeping it tightly sealed. If the original cork just isn't cutting it, you can purchase a bottle cap that creates an airtight seal (such as a Polyseal cap) or transfer your whiskey to a hermetically sealed glass container."

However, decanting your whiskey also won't harm it, and a decanter makes an attractive and flashy serving container. Just make sure your decanter has a tight seal, and keep it in a cool, temperature-controlled area. Avoid decanters made from leaded crystal. Although these containers are very attractive and sparkly, there is a risk of lead leaching into your whiskey if you use them for long-term storage."

In other words, a mostly full bottle of whiskey will stay fresh a lot longer than a bottle that's mostly empty. A mostly full bottle of whiskey can stay good for up to a year after opening, but a bottle that's only a quarter full will start to get flat in about a month. Once your bottle starts getting low (e.g., at around the 1/3rd mark), it may be time to invite a few friends over for a drink! You can also keep your whiskey fresh longer by transferring it into smaller containers as the level in the bottle starts to get low."

Although they are typically marketed as wine-preserving sprays, they also work for whiskey and other spirits. Follow the directions on the package to determine how to use the preserving spray. You can purchase these sprays online, or you may be able to find them at your local liquor store."
