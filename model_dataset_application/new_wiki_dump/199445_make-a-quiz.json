Random results can be just as alienating as negative ones because it may make the person feel like he just wasted his time after receiving a random result. For example, a personality quiz similar to \"what kind of animal are you\" could provide bear as a good result. The description could be something along the lines of \"While you enjoy a good refreshing slumber and may get cranky when you're hungry, everyone knows how much you love your children and that giant hugs were named after you.\" This description is fun and seems personal because it reflects how a bear protects her cubs while using \"bear hugs\" as an indicator of warmth.
