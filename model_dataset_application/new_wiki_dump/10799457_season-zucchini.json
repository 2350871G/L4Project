Cumin, for instance, compliments zucchini perfectly well on its own. To season with a single spice, you can drizzle 4 zucchini halves with 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of olive oil. Then sprinkle the oil-coated zucchini with salt, pepper, and the spice of your choice. If using ground cumin, \u00bd tablespoon (3.5 grams) should suffice.
