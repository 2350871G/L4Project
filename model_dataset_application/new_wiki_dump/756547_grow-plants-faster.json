          "description":"In order for you to pick the correct fertilizer, you will have to see what your soil composition is. Many home and garden stores sell soil testing kits. The results from this test will tell you what nutrients you need to add to create the best balance for your plants to grow."

          "headline":"Pick an organic or inorganic fertilizer.",
          "description":"Choose between organic and inorganic fertilizers. When you select inorganic fertilizer, look for the blend that supplies the best balance of nutrient requirements your soil needs. Organic fertilizers are harder to gauge because they vary in the amount of nutrients they supply. The organic fertilizer must also be broken down into inorganic substances in the soil for the plant to be able to use, which means it will take longer your plants to see a benefit. Inorganic fertilizers provide immediate nutrients to plants and help them grow faster. Organic fertilizers take longer to release in the soil, but they create a healthier soil over time. If your goal is to take an existing plant and make it grow faster, then use inorganic fertilizer. If you are looking to make a long-term garden or flowerbed, then organic fertilizer is more beneficial."

          "headline":"Choose granular or liquid fertilizers.",
          "description":"Granular fertilizers come in small pellets. Like organic fertilizer, they are best for long-term projects like flowerbeds. The coating on granular fertilizer is resin, which causes the nutrients to be released slowly into the soil. Liquid fertilizers work much faster, but they require more applications. Usually, you will need to spray liquid fertilizers on your plants every few weeks. Liquid fertilizer is also more expensive. Choose the fertilizer based on the urgency of your project. If you want future plants to grow faster, then choose granular fertilizers as this will make the soil richer over time. If you have a plant that needs immediate attention, then use the liquid fertilizer. If you choose a liquid fertilizer, make sure the read the directions on the bottle. Too many applications can over-fertilize and kill your plant."

The secondary nutrients required are sulfur, calcium, and magnesium. Last, plants need the micronutrients boron, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc. Without the three macronutrients, a plant will not be able to grow. Some fertilizers will have plant foods added to them. If you are growing one plant, such as a particular flower, this will help it grow. However, if you are growing many different types of plants at once, it is better to get a fertilizer without plant food."

If you let them sprout inside and then transplant them into your garden, the plants will grow 4-6 weeks earlier than if you had waited to plant the seed directly into the flower bed. Gather a small group of containers that are 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310 cm) deep that have drainage holes. Avoid fertilizers. Instead, use a mix of peat moss and vermiculite inside the container. Let the plants set outside in their containers for a few hours each day. Do this for at least two weeks before you transplant them into the flower bed. This will help them acclimate to direct sunlight. The best plants to transplant are tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and melons. Some plants, however, do not transplant well.
