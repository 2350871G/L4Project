Then, apply Chapstick thickly to the area. Be sure to thoroughly coat the wound with balm. Then, cover the skin with a clean cloth or leaf. In a pinch, Chapstick can stop small cuts from bleeding. The waxy substance blocks off the wound and keeps the blood flowing inside your body. As a wound or rash heals, Chapstick will protect the tender area from dirt and bacteria. This may reduce your risk of infection, especially if you are in an unclean or unfamiliar environment."

  "text":" Healing and Protection Look for lip balm with healing properties.
