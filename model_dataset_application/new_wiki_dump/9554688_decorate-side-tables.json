          "description":"You can easily find attractive decorative vases at your nearest department store or home decor outlet. Pick a simple vase that matches the color of another accessory in your living room, like the throw pillows on your couch. Alternatively, create visual interest by choosing a vase with cutout designs. When set near a lamp, a cutout vase will cast appealing shadows along the top of your side table."

          "description":"Pick a style of glass that appeals to you; both opaque and clear glass work as side table decorations. Color is most important for decorating with glass bottles. Try to pick glass bottles in colors that are not identical, but work well together (like violet, pink, and magenta or teal, mint green, and ocean blue). You can also place flowers or sand inside the bottles for an extra touch."

Place it in the middle of the side table on its own so it can take center stage. This decorative choice is simple, but will prove effective at drawing the eyes of your guests."

          "description":"Small coffee table books can be set on top of your side tables. Try to pick books with the most appealing designs. Vibrantly designed books make the best choices. Watch out for interesting lettering and color schemes. Try to pick books of different thicknesses as well for further visual interest. If you want to make your decorating a bit more personal, try to pick books that focus on subject matter you enjoy, such as photos of kittens or gorgeous cityscapes."

For instance, if you\u2019re a lover of the outdoors, decorate your side table with flowers, plants, and stones. If you recently traveled to an amazing city, place souvenirs (such as a mini Eiffel Tower or tiny Kyoto shrine gates) and travel photos from that city on your side table."

Make a potted plant a standalone centerpiece on your side table, or group it with other items, such as decorative jars and a stack of books. Mini ferns and succulents (like cacti and aloe) are great plants to decorate with; succulents also have the advantage of being easy to care for. If you don\u2019t want to care for a live plant, purchase a fake plant to decorate with."

If you\u2019d prefer real flowers, consider using flowers from your home garden or buy flowers from your grocery store\u2019s florist section, and replace them as they wilt. Alternatively, use dried flowers. You can keep your flowers in a vase or bundle them and lay them across the table."

If you can\u2019t find a small mirror to place on your table, set a larger one at an angle so half of it sits on the table and the other half leans against the wall.
