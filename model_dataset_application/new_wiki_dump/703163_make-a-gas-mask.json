Attach it to your face, making sure there are no holes in the insulation that would allow contaminated air to your face. Make sure the bottle cap is off, and breath in the clean air. Making an Air Filter for your Mask Attach a homemade air filtration system to your mask to protect from some gases. While this system is not as powerful as a military-grade air mask, it can successfully filter out some toxins as well as all particle-based contaminates like tear gas. Cut off the top of a 1-liter bottle. Use a razor blade to slice off the top of the bottle, leaving an open cylinder.

Activated charcoal absorbs chemicals and moisture, so it is useless after it has filled up. After every use or prolonged exposure to air you need to replace it with new charcoal. Treating Exposure to Gases and Chemicals Cover your nose and mouth with a t-shirt if you have no other protection. A t-shirt can actually protect you from large particles, like dust or tear gas, though not perfectly. Try to create as perfect a seal as possible using both hands to keep the shirt over your nose and mouth. Bandanas, towels, and blankets will provide similar protection in an emergency. A simple piece of fabric can save your life against ash and dust from a volcanic explosion. Call poison control immediately. If you or someone you know feels light-headed, nauseous, or experiences seizures or loss of consciousness after inhaling a chemical, make a note of the chemical and call poison control immediately. In the U.S., poison control can be reached at the number 1-800-222-1222. Move immediately to fresh air. If the victim is able to move, get them to fresh clean air as soon as possible. Stay away from the source of the chemicals. Turn unconscious victims on their side with their face down. This is called the \u201crecovery position.\u201d Roll unconscious people on their sides, using their upper leg to brace them. Make sure their mouth faces down so that they can easily expel anything that comes up. Wait for emergency services and follow their directions.",
