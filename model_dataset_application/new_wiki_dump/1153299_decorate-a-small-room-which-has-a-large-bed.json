You might be tempted to shove the bed into a corner, but keeping it centered makes it the focal point of the room, keeps things looking symmetrical, and prevents the clutter that comes from trying to fit too much into a small space. If you have enough room to walk on each side of the bed, it'll be easier to make it each morning, too! If your room is too small to have the bed in the center of a wall (maybe the door wouldn't be able to open or close), then push it into a corner and focus on keeping the path beside the bed uncluttered."

Light gray, shades of white, or even a very light rose color can make your bedroom feel bright, fresh, and open. But don't be afraid to go dark if that is what you like! Painting your room with crisp, dark shades of gray or blue can make the room feel more intimate and chic. If you are going dark, take into consideration how much natural light the room gets\u2014you don't want to feel claustrophobic. If you already have a bedspread and don't plan on buying a new one, choose a complementary paint color that works with it, like a neutral or pastel in the right color scheme."

Choose curtains that will reach the floor even when hung up at ceiling height. If you plan to keep the curtains drawn during the day, choose double-layer curtains with a sheer layer to let in more light while still letting you maintain your privacy. Try choosing curtains that match the wall color to keep your eyes from getting overwhelmed by too many colors."

Hanging lights, rather than a ceiling light that goes in the middle of the room, are especially helpful for lighting dark corners. Install sconces on either side of your bed to provide extra lighting. Install a ceiling light if you don't already have one. If you rent, make sure whatever changes you are making are approved by your landlord before starting. If your landlord doesn't want you making any changes to the lighting, invest in some thin, tall, floor lamps to place in the corners."
