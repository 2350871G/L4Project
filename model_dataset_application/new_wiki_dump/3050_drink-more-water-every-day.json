          "description":"Always having water on hand makes it easier to remember to drink it. Slip a reusable water bottle into your purse, gym bag, backpack, desk drawer, or car, and refill it regularly. Avoid chugging or taking big gulps from your water bottle. Instead, take small sips throughout the day. Water bottles come in all sizes, styles, and materials. You can even get water bottles with built-in water filters so the water will taste better."

          "description":"It\u2019s important to drink more water any time you\u2019ve been sweating, such as when you\u2019re exercising or after spending time in a hot environment. Always keep a bottle of water on hand and take sips from it often when you're hot or sweaty."

          "headline":"Have a glass of water before and during meals to reduce your appetite.",
          "description":"Drinking water before your meals and while you eat can help to reduce your appetite since thirst is often confused with hunger. Replace your typical drink before and during meals with water, or at least have water to drink on the side. This will save you money when you eat out and help you cut calories. Drink a glass of water while you prepare your dinner or while you\u2019re waiting for your meal to arrive at a restaurant. Tip: Ask for water with a lemon wedge in it when you eat out. This will help to make the water taste better."

          "headline":"Alternate between alcoholic drinks and water at parties, bars, or meals.",
          "description":"Alcohol dehydrates you so it\u2019s important to drink water along with any alcoholic beverages you consume. Try to have a glass of water after every alcoholic beverage to stay hydrated. Moderation is best when it comes to drinking alcohol. Try not to exceed 1 drink per day if you\u2019re a woman or 2 drinks per day if you\u2019re a man. One drink is 12  fl oz (350 mL) of beer, 5  fl oz (150 mL) of wine, or 1.5  fl oz (44 mL) of spirits."

Triggers to sip water can be routine activities that you do all the time, such as:\nMaking or receiving a phone call\nStretching while you're at work or school\nHearing someone say your name\nChecking your email"

Then, write times that correspond to the lines, such as 9:00 am 1/4 of the way down the bottle, 11:00am halfway down the bottle, and 1:00pm 3/4 of the way down the bottle. If you need to refill your water bottle more than once per day, then you could write additional times along these lines, such as 10:00 am/2:00pm at the halfway mark."

You can also track your water intake in food tracker apps, such as My Fitness Pal, Fat Secret, and YAZIO. Record your intake each time you have a bottle or a glass of water. You can also purchase a water bottle that connects with an app on your phone and tells you when you\u2019ve reached your goal for the day. These can be expensive, but it might be a good option if you seriously struggle to remember to drink water or if you\u2019re just a fan of gadgets!"

Try filling up a water bottle or pitcher of water and adding a few simple fruit or veggie slices, or a sprig of fresh herbs.

You can purchase flavored sparkling water or add your own flavor to sparkling water using lemon, lime, berries, and cucumber slices.
