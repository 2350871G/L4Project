In addition to asking your appraiser for the resale value of the diamonds, try to find out about the following factors, which can affect the value and desirability of a diamond:\nColor: The Gemological Institute of America rates diamonds on a color scale from D (most colorless) to Z (highest color). In general, the more colorless the diamond, the higher its value (with the exception of \u201cfancy color diamonds,\u201d such as pink and blue diamonds). Cut: This refers to the shape of the diamond and the quality of the cut. Clarity: This is a measurement of the flawlessness of the stone. The Gemological Institute of America rates diamonds from \u201cFlawless\u201d (no inclusions or imperfections) to I3 (the highest level of \u201cIncluded\u201d). Carat: This is a measure of the weight of a diamond.

In general, you will probably have to settle on a price much lower than the retail value of your diamond jewelry.
