You can clean them where they are, but you will need a ladder to access the top to clean the mildew. Look for a ladder with a platform at the top that will hold your cleaning supplies. If you have access to a cherry picker or other lift device, you can use those as well."

On an awning, it will likely appear as gray or white spots, and will look like a powder. You can simply use a regular cleaner if your awning doesn\u2019t have mildew."

If you need more cleaning solution, simply double or triple all the quantities. Mild liquid soaps include laundry soaps that are designed for sensitive skin, babies, or delicate fabrics. Do not use chlorine bleach on canvas, as this can damage the fabric. For colored awnings, use a color safe bleach. It\u2019s also a good idea to test a patch of the cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area to test for color fastness. Place some cleaning solution on a small patch of the top side of the awning and let it sit for 20 minutes before rinsing and checking for discoloration."

Re-dip the cloth as necessary so that cleaning solution reaches every inch of the fabric, otherwise you might miss some of the mildew. Once the entire surface of the awning has been soaked with cleaner, let it sit for about 15 minutes. This will give the cleaner time to soak into the fabric and kill the mildew."
