Then rotate this position around the table for each subsequent hand. For four players, play two separate games. Or form teams, and after the two simultaneous games, add up your and your teammate's scores to see if together you beat your opponents' total."

If you think your opponent may reach gin before you, you can knock early to prevent them from getting those bonus points. Draw a card and discard one when it's your turn, placing the one you don't want face-down on the discard pile to end the game. End the game only if your deadwood totals ten points or less. You can only knock if the points values for your deadwood cards total ten or less. Kings, queens, and jacks are worth 10, aces are worth 1, and all numerical cards are worth their numerical value.

Lay down all your cards face-up and divide them into melds on the table. Make it clear for your opponent to see your sets and runs by grouping cards within a meld closely together and also putting some space between the melds themselves. Lay off deadwood cards onto the knocker's melds. Your opponent now has the chance to lay off their deadwood cards onto your cards to add to melds. For example, if you have three 5's, and one of their deadwood cards is a 5, they can add that to your set. Or they could add that 5 to a run of 6-7-8 or 2-3-4. Deadwood can not be laid off onto other deadwood. If you have two 3's that are deadwood, and your opponent has an extra 3, they can not create a new meld.

This means that one player will potentially end up with a lot of deadwood, and thus a lot of deadwood points for the knocker to claim. Subtract your deadwood points from your opponent's. Both players should now ignore any melds that have been formed \u2013 they don't contribute any points to the scoring. Add up each player's deadwood points and subtract to find the difference.

Each player then earns an additional 25 points for every round they won. If one player doesn't win any rounds, this is a shutout, and the winner earns an additional 100 bonus points. The player with the most points after all the tallying is the winner. Using Strategies to Win Memorize cards that are being discarded. Keep track of what cards both you and your opponent have discarded, as these will indicate what to avoid collecting. For example, if you saw two kings end up in the discard pile, then you shouldn't hold onto any kings in your hand since these will certainly become deadwood. Memorize which cards your opponent is picking up. Get a sense for which cards your opponent is picking up from the discard pile since these will clue you into their sets and runs. If you see them picking up a couple 9's, don't discard a 9 you have in your hand or you risk helping them out. Aim for runs over sets. Runs can be added onto at either end of the sequence. But once you reach three of a kind, sets can only be added onto in one way. And you're less likely to find that one extra card for a set than the two possible cards that can add to your run. Knock as early as possible. You can't knock until your deadwood is down to 10 or fewer points, but as soon as you reach that threshold, it might be a good idea to knock. Waiting too long in the hopes that you'll reach gin could mean letting your opponent reach it first.",
