Mark the design you want to create on a piece of graph paper and follow the pattern as you knit.

Use one color for the spots marked with an X and another color for the spots marked with a circle.

  "text":" Choosing and Using Intarsia Charts Choose an intarsia chart. Choosing a pre-made intarsia chart may be your best option if you are new to intarsia knitting.

A good starter project might also be something that only features two colors, such as a letter or shape in the center of a knit item.

Changing Colors Twist the strands together when you switch. After each color change, twist the strands together one time. This will help to anchor the yarn in place. When you return to the same spot again, twist the strands again and continue knitting. Pick up the new color from under the old color for vertical knit and purl stitches. Whenever you switch yarns, you will need to pick up the new color. For vertical stitches (those that are forming a straight up and down line between two colors), insert your needle underneath the old color to pick up the new color. Bring the new color over the old color for diagonal knit stitches. Diagonal knit stitches require a slightly different approach from vertical knit stitches. When changing colors in a pattern that forms a diagonal line, insert the needle over the old color of yarn to pick up the new color. Pick up the new color from under the old color for diagonal purl stitches. If you are purling a diagonal stitch, then you will pick up the yarn from under the old color of yarn.
