The object of the game is to move through the board, eventually getting all your pieces off the board. To move, you move your pieces down the first row. The way you move down this row is with the hieroglyphs on your side, you move left. Once you reach the end of the first row, you turn a corner and proceed the opposite way down the second row. Once you reach the end of the second row, you once again turn a corner. You then proceed the opposite way down the third row. Once you reach the end of the third row, you move your piece off the board. The number of squares you move at a time is based on how you throw the senet sticks."

How many sticks land with the black side facing up determines your move. If you have three black sides and one color side, you can move one house and toss again.

The House of Rebirth is marked by three sideways stick figures. Your piece remains on the House of Rebirth until you choose to remove it again. The House of Three Truths is marked by a drawing of three birds. If you land on this house, you can throw your sticks again. If you have three color sides up, you can automatically remove this piece from the board. The House of Re-Atoum is marked by two dancing stick figures. If you have landed here, throw your sticks again. If you have two colored sticks facing up, you can remove your piece from the board. The last house on the board is marked by a leaf-like drawing.
