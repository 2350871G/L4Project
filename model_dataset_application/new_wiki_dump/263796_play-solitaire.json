  "text":" Setting Solitaire Up Understand the object of the game. It is to create four piles of cards - one per suit - in ascending order (beginning with Ace and ending with King.

Put the remaining cards in a separate pile and set it either above or below the piles. This pile is where you will go to get more cards if you run out of moves. Leave room at the top for four piles of cards.  Playing Solitaire Look at the cards on the table that are face up. If there are any aces, place them above the seven piles. If there are no aces, rearrange the cards you have, moving only the face up cards. When you place a card on top (slightly lower so that you can still see both cards), it must be a different color than the card you are placing it on top of and have a value of one less.

If you have an ace above your cards, (eventually you should have all four aces there), you may move cards of the place cards of the corresponding suit on top of the pile in ascending (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K) order.
