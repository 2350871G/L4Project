          "description":"Anytime an animal sees something new, it's going to be curious, especially cats. Let the animal take a moment to give the camera a good sniff all over, so they will be less likely to do so in the middle of your photo shoot. If you're not photographing your own pet, let the animal give you a good sniff as well, so they are more comfortable in the session."

          "headline":"Get them used to the flash and shutter sound.",
          "description":"Sometimes, the flash will freeze an animal in place for a second, which can be good if you're trying to get a still shot. However, both the shutter sound and flash can distract the animal enough to ruin the shot, so take a few shots just so they can get used to that part of the camera. Try shooting a couple of shots towards the ceiling so the animal can hear the shutter sound and see the flash."

          "description":"If you go outside or you take your pet to a new area, they are going to want to explore. Give them a few minutes to look around first! That way, they won't be as distracted when you're ready to take the pictures. If your pet is on a leash, walk them slowly around the area, letting them sniff as you go. If you're in a confined space with a small animal, give them a chance to walk around by itself for a minute."

          "description":"Natural light is great for any photography, and pet photography is no exception. If it's especially bright, pick a shaded area where you'll get ambient light for your pictures. Try the hour just after sunrise or the one just before sunset. These hours, called the \"golden hours,\" have the best light. Avoid the harsh light of midday. Of course, you won't be able to take some pets outdoors. In that case, try to get your pet in an area with as much natural light as you can. Open blinds and curtains to let in the light! If natural light isn't an option, try using a detached flash. Point it up at the ceiling, and it will reflect back down on your pet to create perfect lighting."

          "description":"Aim for mostly solid colors in the background, instead of patterns and other people. For instance, grass or even a solid color piece of furniture work well in the background. If the background is too busy, your pet won't stand out as much as you'd like. Try to pick a background that makes your pet stand out. For instance, pick a bright color for a black cat, or a dark color for a blonde dog."

In your photo shoot, take some tightly cropped facial shots (even focusing in on a single features like the eyes, nose, or ears) but also make sure you take shots that show off your more of your pet's body. Working on different angles may give you an unexpectedly good shot you never would have gotten if you hadn't moved around some."

Split the treats up into small bites, as you may need to bribe your animal quite a few times. Try asking someone to hold a treat in their hand near the camera. Make sure the pet knows they have it, and then have the person hide it away. This trick usually evokes good expressions from the animal, especially dogs."

If you have another person nearby, it might be easier if they use the toy to play with the pet while you snap pictures. Tug-of-war toys work great for dogs, and string-type toys work well for cats, as you can entice them to come over. Any toy that keeps your pet mostly in the same place should be fine. Balls don't work as well, unless someone is throwing a ball in your direction. Otherwise, the animal will be running away from you."

Other pets may do better with calm, almost cooing voices. You know what your pet likes to hear! Use the pet names you have for it, using your happy voice. For instance, try a cheerful but calm voice when working with cats. For birds, be very cheerful, but not so loud you scare them. Whistles may help, too! If it's not your pet, get the owner to talk to the pet instead, as they may have better luck than you."

For instance, you could have a person pop out from behind you or use a squeaky toy to make a noise. You could also try unique noises, such as finger drumming, tongue-clicking, scratching, and whistling."

One way to help combat that problem is to increase the exposure, so the picture is brighter. On most iPhones, you can increase the brightness by tapping on your pet's face in the picture to focus on it, then move the sun icon up when it appears on the screen.
