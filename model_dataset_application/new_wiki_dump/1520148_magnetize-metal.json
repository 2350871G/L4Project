          "description":"Every magnet has two poles, a North and a South pole. The North pole is the negative side, while the South pole is the positive side. Some magnets have the poles labeled directly on them. If your magnet is not labeled you can use a pole identifier magnet. This is a magnet that has the poles labeled on it. Place the identifier near your magnet and see which side attaches. Opposite sides attract, so if the magnet attaches to the South pole of the identifier magnet, that side is the North pole."

          "description":"With firm pressure, quickly run the magnet across the piece of metal. The act of rubbing the magnet across the metal helps the iron atoms align in one direction. Repeatedly stroking the metal gives the atoms more opportunity to line up. Repeat the stroke towards the negative pole at least ten times. Ten strokes is just a good number to start with. You can do more or less as long as the metal works to your satisfaction as a magnet."

If the metal does not become magnetized, keep rubbing the magnet in the same direction across the metal. If you are magnetizing a screwdriver, put it next to a screw to see if it holds it."

          "headline":"Continue rubbing the magnet against object to increase the magnetism.",
          "description":"Make sure you rub the magnet in the same direction every time. After ten strokes, check the magnetism again. Repeat until the magnet is strong enough to pick up the paperclips. If you rub in the opposite direction with the North pole this will actually demagnetize the metal. If the metal still does not maintain magnetization, it might not have a high enough iron content. Try this method again with a metal that has a higher iron content."
