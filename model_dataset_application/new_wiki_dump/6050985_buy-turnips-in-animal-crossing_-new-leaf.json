      "description":"Unlike the stores in the shopping plaza, the turnip vendor is not open on a daily basis. There is no actual \"shop\" for turnips, as the vendor will wander through the town. She will only appear in the player\u2019s town on Sunday, from 6 .a.m. until noon. If you do not want to wait until Sunday, simply change the date in game. You can do this at the initial screen, when Isabelle is starting the game for you. Before choosing to start your game file, select the option to change something. Isabelle will ask what you want to fix. Select the change time and date option, and set the clock to a time on Sunday between 6 a.m. and noon. However, \"time traveling\" in ACNL, even just for about a week, can cause \"side effects,\" like bedhead hair, villagers forgetting you, villagers moving away, cockroaches in your house, and other things."

This price will not change during the day; however, it will change by week. If the turnip prices are quite high, either buy only ten turnips or just wait until next week. However, take advantage and buy many turnips if prices are low (in the 90-95 range). Turnips can be held in your inventory or stored in drawers within your home."
