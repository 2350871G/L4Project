  "text":" Choosing the Right Tools for the Job Get a steel trowel with serrated edges. Almost any home improvement store will sell these tools. They are not specific to the cove finish, but it gives the surface the grainy texture needed for the traction once it cures.

Applying the Cove Finish Work your concrete to the point of floating. The finish comes after you float the surface, i.e. have compacted and let the surface partially dry. Where you typically see instructions to trowel or broom the surface is where you will do the cove. Lay your concrete, screed it (level the excess concrete), and smooth the surface.
