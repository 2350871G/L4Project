          "headline":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).",
          "description":"Meanwhile, prepare two 8-inch (20-cm) square baking pans by greasing them and dusting them with a light coating of all-purpose flour. Cover a clean, dry paper towel with a generous dab of shortening, then wipe the shortening over the bottoms and sides of both pans. You could also grease the pans using butter or nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle about 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of flour into each pan. Carefully shift and rock the pans from side to side, continuing until the entire bottoms are coated with flour. Dump the excess flour out of the pans."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Beat the ingredients together.",
          "description":"Combine the cake mix, eggs, water, and melted butter in a large mixing bowl. Beat the ingredients together using an electric mixer set to medium or high speed, and continue for several minutes, or until evenly combined. While these ingredients are standard for boxed cake mixes, consult the instructions on the back of the box for more precise amounts; follow the brand instructions for best results. Some cakes may call for more eggs, water, or fat. Note that most boxed mixes will instruct you to use vegetable oil instead of butter, but using equal amounts of melted butter will give the cake a much richer flavor."

          "headline":"Pour the batter into the prepared pans.",
          "description":"Evenly split the cake batter into your two prepared baking pans. Gently shift the pans from side to side, making the batter level."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Bake for 30 minutes.",
          "description":"Place both pans onto the middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake the cake for about 30 minuets, or until a toothpick inserted into the centers of both portions comes out clean. Exact baking times may vary depending on the cake mix you use; consult the box for more precise instructions, when possible. If you're uncertain about how fast the cake will bake, it's best to start checking it after the first 20 minutes of baking time. Continue checking every 2 to 5 minutes until the cake is ready."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cool the cake.",
          "description":"Remove both pans of the finished cake out of the oven. Allow the cake to cool to room temperature inside the pans, then carefully tip both portions out onto a clean work surface. Afterward, wrap both portions with plastic wrap, then place them into a freezer for about 15 minutes. While this part of the process isn't strictly necessary, it may make the cake easier to cut and manipulate while minimizing the amount of crumbs left behind."

          "description":"Using a sharp kitchen knife, cut each prepared portion of cake crosswise into two halves. Each half should measure about 4 inches (10 cm) wide by 8 inches (20 cm) long. This step should result in four evenly sized rectangles of cake. You'll need to trim and stack these rectangles in various ways to create the body of the ship. After dividing the cake into these four rectangles, center one rectangle over a cake board or piece of parchment paper. This rectangle will be the bottom layer of cake."

Create a rectangle measuring about 4 inches (10 cm) wide by  inches (15 cm) long, starting at one end of the cake. Just beyond the first rectangle, draw a curved triangle over the remaining cake that meets at a point in the center of the untouched end. Fill in both outlines with about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of buttercream to help define the shape and hold the layers together."

        {
          "headline":"Cut the third layer into three pieces.",
          "description":"Using a sharp knife, cut the third portion of cake into three separate pieces, working along the length of the rectangle. One piece should measure about 4 inches (10 cm) long, and the other two should each measure about 2 inches (5 cm) long. Set the middle section aside for now. Use the longest portion and opposite end for the next step."

Place the short section of cake over the rectangular portion of icing, matching it end-to-end with that side. Using icing, pipe the same triangular outline over the front end of the hull, matching it as closely as possible to the previous two layers. Cover the tops of both pieces with buttercream to help the final layer stick."

You can round off the corners of the rectangular end, if desired, but doing so is not strictly necessary."

        {
          "headline":"Cut the final layer into two pieces.",
          "description":"Slice the final rectangle into two 4-inch (10-cm) square pieces of cake. Using the serrated knife, carve one of these pieces into the same triangular shape currently featured at the front of the hull. If you rounded the back corners of the main body, you should round off those corners on the other piece of cake, as well. Since the cake becomes less stable as you stack the layers, it's best to carve these portions of cake before stacking them onto your previous layer."

Don't worry if crumbs dislodge and get caught in the frosting; the point of a crumb coat is to catch these crumbs and prevent them from sneaking into the final, visible layer of icing."

Alternatively, you can refrigerate the cake 8 hours to overnight instead of freezing it. It might be tempting to skip this step, but doing so would be highly discouraged. Room temperature cake will be difficult to frost and decorate in an elaborate manner."

It may take some practice before you'll be able to make the frosting smooth, especially around the awkward inner corners of the cake. To make the process as easy as possible, spoon generous portions of frosting over all areas and patiently glide it over the flat surfaces using an icing spatula. Work carefully and slowly; do not attempt to rush through this part of the process."

Place the pretzels cut-side down into the icing, pressing just firmly enough to hold them in place. If desired, consider using chocolate-covered pretzel snaps or covering the pretzels in milk chocolate on your own before using them to decorate the ship."

Press the wider end of the peanut butter cups into the icing, using just enough pressure to help them stick. If you're allergic to peanut butter, consider using round pretzels or other small cup-shaped candies instead."

Note that the skewer should enter and exit the sail from the same side of the paper.

Cut two 4-inch (10-cm) by 3-inch (7.6-cm) rectangles out of black or navy blue construction paper. These two pieces of construction paper will become the sails. Thread the paper onto two skewers. Poke one wooden skewer through one sail in two places, threading it all the way through until the flat end of the skewer rests at the top of the sail. Repeat with the other skewer and other sail. For cleaner holes, consider punching the holes with a hole punch instead of poking them out with the skewer itself.
