Rolled edges are popular with delicate projects like scarves and handkerchiefs, so you may want to use a fine needle and fine thread. Try using a straw needle in size 11 with some delicate thread. Thread the needle by inserting the end of the thread through the eye of the needle. Tie a couple of knots at the end of the thread to anchor it in place when you begin sewing."

After you fold down the fabric and complete your first few stitches, the knot will be hidden. Some sewers do not recommend knotting the thread to secure it out of concern for the fabric. Instead, they recommend allowing the stitches to hold the thread in place. If you are concerned about the knot damaging your fabric, then you can try starting the stitch without a knot. You will just need to take care not to let the end of the thread pull through. After several stitches, your thread should be secured."

However, it is a good idea to crease the fabric, such as by pressing the edge with an iron. Keep in mind that pressing with an iron is optional. You can also crease the edge with your fingers or use a coin to crease the edge if ironing is not an option. Be careful when creasing or pressing delicate fabric. You may want to lay a piece of scrap fabric over the fabric and crease or iron through the extra fabric to protect it."
