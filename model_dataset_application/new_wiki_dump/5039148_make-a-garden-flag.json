For inspiration check out a site such as Pinterest or some craft blogs. With a garden flag that hangs vertically, it isn't all that important that the material can flutter in the breeze. Consider weighing your fabric down with heavier materials so that it hangs well and displays your design without wrapping around the flagpole."

Use fabric paint to draw on your flag. Use a glue gun to paste objects onto your flag. Ideas include seashells, Christmas baubles, silk flowers or buttons. Make a patchwork garden flag by stitching clashing prints onto the background using bright contrast yarn for the stitches. Use stencils and a spray can to quickly create a design on your flag. Try using the same material or a contrasting material to add a bow or ruffle to your flag."

Allow 4 inches (10.2 cm) length for the hanging flap, then cut your flag material an additional 18 inches (45.7 cm) long i.e. 22 inches (55.9 cm). If you are growing tall plants underneath the flagpole, consider making the flag shorter in length so it will all be visible above the plants. The main thing is that the material should not touch the ground as it will get wet and muddy. You might like to double it the flag length to provide extra weight and make it hang better."

At the top of your flag, fold over a 4 inch (10.2 cm) piece of material. This will create the pocket that the flag rod will insert into in order to hang your flag. Glue or stitch along the bottom horizontal side of this flap but do not glue the left and right sides as this is where the flap pole will insert into."

Post mix can be easily stirred up in the hole so that\u2019s easy to use. Fill the hole to slightly below the surface.
