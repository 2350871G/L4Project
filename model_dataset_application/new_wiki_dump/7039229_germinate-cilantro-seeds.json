  "text":" Preparing the Soil Fill your container, pot, etc. with soil. Get cilantro seeds and pick out ones that aren't cracked or irregularly small.  Gently push the seeds into the dirt, and cover the seeds with a layer of dirt.  Germination Keep the soil moist and expect to see seed germination around 7 days after the seeds were planted.  After 7 days or less, under the soil the cilantro should have a white sprout coming out of the seed. You can check by gently uncovering the soil with your fingers and exposing the seed. After another 2-3 days, you should see a green sprout pushing through the soil. If you uncovered the sprout than a green sprout should be visibly coming out of the seed. Care for Cilantro Seedlings The soil should always be wet, but allow the soil to dry out before watering. This will help keep mold and diseases away from the seedling. The seedling should have full sun for a few hours. The seedling should not have more than 4/5 hours of full sunlight or else it can wilt and die.
