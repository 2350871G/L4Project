Plan out what you want your candle to look like, then tie down or attach the paper with Scotch tape to start the decorating process.Tip: You can cut out fun shapes to glitter around, or simply use straight strips to make stripes. For thinner or more precise shapes, try using painter\u2019s tape or even rubber bands."

You can paint over the edges of the paper to ensure full coverage, but try not to cover the paper completely. If you don\u2019t have Mod Podge, you can make your own or use regular liquid glue, although the glitter may not stay on as long."

You\u2019ll get glitter on your work surface, so put down newspapers beforehand to catch it. Tap the bottom of the candle gently against the surface when you\u2019re done to knock off any extra glitter. Match the glitter color to your candle and your event. You might pair red glitter with a white candle for the holidays, for example, or put black glitter on an orange candle for Halloween."
