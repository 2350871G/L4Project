After sanding, use a damp cloth to wipe away the mess. If your table is made out of metal or plastic, there\u2019s no need to sand it unless it\u2019s painted. If necessary, sand off old paint. If it\u2019s unpainted, just clean it up and wipe away any dirt or dust."

          "description":"If you have an extra gallon of flat paint lying around, use it as a primer. Priming your table will reduce the amount of chalkboard paint you\u2019ll need. If you don\u2019t have any extra flat paint, pick up some up from the hardware store. Using an inexpensive paint as a primer instead of applying more coats of chalkboard paint will save you some money. Flat paint is matte, or the opposite of high gloss paint. A glossy first coat wouldn't be as receptive to additional coats as a flat coat."

Let it dry, then add another coat if the color is uneven or patchy. If you have a table made of a grainy wood, use a bristled paintbrush instead of a roller or sponge brush. You\u2019ll have an easier time getting into the grain with a bristled brush. If you\u2019d like, hold off painting the legs or base so you can later add a high contrast color."

For example, a high gloss white would look great with black chalkboard paint. Depending on your room\u2019s color scheme, you could go with a pop of turquoise, orange, or another bright color. Look for a color in a rug, curtain, or accessory that you could echo with the table legs. Paint the legs after the top is dry so you can turn the table over to reach the base\u2019s nooks and crannies."
