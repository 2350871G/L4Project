It would be a good idea to ensure that it is in working order before the cold weather settles in. Change out the filter for a new one, and clean out any dust or debris. Check the furnace for any signs of damage\u2014this includes things like cracks, strange noises, or strange smells. Consider having a professional furnace technician inspect your furnace and gas lines (if you have a gas furnace). Plan on changing your furnace's filter every 30 to 90 days. This will help your furnace last longer. If you can't replace your filter right away, clean it with a soft brush and a vacuum."

You should have a professional inspect your gas heaters and stoves. There are also a few things you can do on your own. Start by shutting off the heater or stove completely, then:\nCheck the exhaust vents and air-shutter openings for dust. Vacuum the exhaust vents and air-shutter openings. Clean the burner to ensure that it is dust and lint free."

You should also clean the stove, and replace the pipe if necessary. A clean, well-maintained stove will give you a warm, bright fire. Make sure that the stove is resting on a heat-safe surface, and that there is nothing flammable close by. If you have children or pets, consider fencing the stove off when it is burning."

Unfortunately, with all of these warm, cozy comforts comes an increased risk of fire. You should prepare your home and family for the possibility of a fire by doing the following:\nMake sure that there is a smoke and carbon monoxide detector on every floor of your home. Test if the detectors are working by pressing the test button, and change out the batteries, if needed. Have a multi-task fire extinguisher (it should have an A-B-C rating on the label) in an easily-accessible spot. Instruct your family members on how to use the fire extinguisher. Check all existing fire extinguishers for damage, including dents, scratches, and corrosion. If the extinguisher is over 6 years old, get a new one. Clear spaces around fireplaces, heaters, furnaces, and stoves. You will be using these more often as the weather gets colder, so you won't want anything flammable close to them."

Instruct your family members on how to properly handle stoves, heaters, and fire extinguishers. It would be a good idea to teach them to practice common sense regarding open flames\u2014such as never leaving burning candles, fireplaces, or stoves unattended.

If your windows aren't sealed properly, your home could lose lots of heat, causing your gas and heating bills to spike! If you have a lot of windows and not a lot of time and money, focus on the biggest windows, such as patio doors or bay windows. Here are some more tips on insulating your windows and doors:\nPlace a polyurethane sheet over your windows. It is often referred to as an \"insulation kit,\" and it will help keep the warm air in and the cold air out. Check for any gaps in the caulk around your windows. If you find any gaps, fill them in with some caulk. Check your door's weather stripper by closing it on a sheet of paper. If the paper moves about easily, the weather stripper needs to be replaced. Check your windows and doors for tightness by holding a candle close to them. If the candle flickers, there might be a leak."

If you seldom use your fireplace, however, shine a flashlight into the flue, and look for any deposits. If you find any that are \u215b-inch (0.32-centimeter) thick (or thicker), call in a professional chimney sweep. Here are some other things you should look out for:\nCheck the flute for creosote buildup to prevent fires. This is essential if you have a wood-burning stove or fireplace. Check the flue for any blockages, especially if you don't have a chimney cap. Birds love to build nests on top of chimneys! Check the damper. It is a metal plate that opens and closes the flue above the firebox. It should open and close smoothly and easily\nCheck the chimney for any overall signs of damage.
