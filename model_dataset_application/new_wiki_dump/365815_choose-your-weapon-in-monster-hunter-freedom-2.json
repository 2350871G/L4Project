This can be the most powerful weapon when treated right. Unlike all other weapons, you can still kick with the weapon drawn by pressing Select, very good for hitting allies when they are confused.

The other one is the golfswing-grandslam, which is very powerful. This is the Superpound. The strongest combo, Triple Pound, is easily done, just press Triangle, Triangle, Triangle. The hammer is an impact weapon, so it can't cut tails, but can crush things easily. by triple pounding certain monsters head/body, they will be dazed and confused, and, in the bullfango's case, go on it's back.
