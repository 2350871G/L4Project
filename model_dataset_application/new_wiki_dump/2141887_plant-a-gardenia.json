Certain hardy varieties can make it through the winter with some protection, and others are suitable for growing in pots and bringing indoors when the temperature gets cold. Varieties suitable for outdoor planting in humid climates include Golden Magic, Aimee, August Beauty, Miami Supreme, and Mystery. Varieties hardy enough to withstand colder temperatures include Chuck Hayes, Klein\u2019s Hardy, Grif\u2019s Select, and Shooting Star\nVarieties that do well in pots that are brought inside in the winter include White Gem, Veitchii, Radicans, and Kimura Shikazaki."

If you can, plant the gardenia in close range to a window or porch so that you'll be able to enjoy its sweet scent when it blooms. In very hot parts of the southern US gardenias like morning sun and afternoon shade if possible. In cooler areas they will do well in full sun."

Soil that's close to concrete edging and paths tends to be more acidic than soil in other spots. If the soil's pH is over 6, you'll need to amend it before planting your gardenia."

Test the soil again to make sure the pH level is correct before planting."
