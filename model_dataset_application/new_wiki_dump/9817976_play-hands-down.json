The hand on top is considered to have lost that Hands Down battle, but the game isn't done. By looking in the center of the unit, the color of the paddle will mark who marked the unit last. These paddles may differ in color from year to year's models some, but generally, have single colors that vary on common colors. Play doesn't end until all paddles of the remaining players have slapped their paddles during a Hands Down event. Likewise, if all the paddles clump together so no one can tell who was last to push their hand down, this Hands Down event won't count."
