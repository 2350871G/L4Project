Lightweight fabrics will allow more light than heavier fabrics but also do not provide a lot of privacy and hold heat in less efficiently. Poly crepe de chine and chiffon are both good fabric options for sheer, lightweight curtains."

          "description":"Heavier fabrics are also better generally at keeping in heat and making your home more energy efficient. Most who use heavier fabrics for patio door curtains will use a tieback or holdback to pull the curtain away from the door for easy access and a sweeping formal feel. Heavier fabrics like suede, velvet, and tapestry provide different textures and are good at blocking out light and keeping heat in when desired. A good example of a heavy fabric with a nice natural texture that is good for curtains is linen cotton canvas. Other heavyweight fabrics include eco canvas and silky faille."

          "description":"The color and pattern of your patio door curtains should enhance the theme of the rest of the room and pull all the furnishings together. Solid neutral colors are generally preferred due to their ability to blend into the d\u00e9cor of a room and the slower fade of color in the sunlight over time than brighter colors. However, if you prefer, choose a brighter color and/or strong print to accent your room."

          "description":"Making the final decision on your curtains can be difficult, but don't make this decision in a hurry. Not just any fabric will fall how you want it to, so it\u2019s important to examine the fabric you are considering carefully in the store. Work with 2 yards of fabric to accurately see how the fabric drapes. If you can, hold the fabric in front of a window in the store. Pleat the fabric at the top like an accordion. If the drape poofs up, then it\u2019s not going to fall nicely on a window."

          "headline":"Hang your curtains stylishly and practically.",
          "description":"Hanging curtains above the doorway will add a sense of height to the room. For patio doors, curtains should hang a smidge above the floor to keep them clean. Curtain rods can also be installed at the top and bottom of the door with shirred or pleated curtains pulled taught by each. This style can be modified by adding a cinch in the middle to pull the fabric in and add visual interest. Most curtains hang on rods with a rod pocket sewn into the curtains for a simple and casual look, but this may be less practical for a highly trafficked patio door. Hidden tabs provide easier movement and make the curtain look almost detached from the rod. Hanging pins are a popular option with easy movement that also provides the option of added length. Another option is cutting the top of the curtain into strips that you can tie to the rod, which gives a romantic and rustic look."

Purchase the curtain you like best for the room and patio door the curtain is meant for and spruce it up as you like. Accessories such as drapery holdbacks or tiebacks can be attractive and practical for curtains, particularly if they are hung above the doorway. If a curtain isn\u2019t quite as long as you need or want it to be, consider lengthening it by adding coordinating pieces of fabric from an old bed skirt or scraps that reflect your style. Embellishments such as beads, braided fabric, ribbon, paint, and tassels are also options to add visual interest to your curtains."

          "headline":"Choose vertical blinds to give your patio door a formal and classy look.",
          "description":"Vertical blinds offer total control of the light that enters a room through a window and for that reason also allow for privacy when desired. They can also be set up on a track to be swept to one end of the patio door to let in the maximum amount of light. Vertical blinds also, however, work best with sliding glass patio doors. Vertical blinds come in a variety of materials such as wood, faux wood, pvc plastics, and even fabrics. Wood can soften the effect of the hard vertical lines with a natural effect while pvc plastics can come in different colors that reflect the theme of your room. Another thing to consider with vertical blinds is that the slats can come in different sizes: 1-inch, 2-inch, and 3.5-inch. 1-inch slats are budget-friendly while 3.5-inch gives your patio door a more modern look and 2-inch slats carry a traditional feel. There are also options to have vertical blinds installed between the glass panels of a sliding glass door to avoid the hassle of cleaning the slats and the risks of the long slats breaking from use."

          "description":"Plantation shutters are more expensive, but stylish and can open and close separate from your French doors or plain glass patio doors or they can be set on a track similar to sliding glass door tracks. Plantation shutters are much like blinds in light control and privacy but are also more sturdily set, easier to clean, and are more durable. The louvers, or slats, of plantation shutters can come wider or narrower to fit your desires and rotate from open to close for light control. Plantation shutters also come in a variety of materials, but your budget is something to consider seriously when choosing materials. They can be cheaper in some materials such as aluminum and pvc plastics, but other materials such as wood are going to cost you. White and timber brown are the most commonly chosen colors in plantation shutters. Timber brown is a color that pops, but it also makes a room much darker when the shutters are closed. White is preferred by many because it is a color that reflects light much better than darker colors and makes a room much brighter without direct sunlight when the shutters are closed. White is also more likely to blend with current and future room changes."

Window treatments generally should follow the way the window or door goes, so sliding door panels may not be the best option for your patio door. If double doors both open outwards, curtains dressing them should be pulled back the same way. Sliding door panels should generally be paired with sliding glass doors and provides an easy way to block or let in light while also allowing for privacy when desired. Color choice is much the same as colors in shades, which is to say unless you prefer a stronger color, stick with a neutral color to fit with any future remodeling. Install your panels. Sliding door panels, depending on what you purchase, may need to be professionally installed, such as when the panels need to be sandwiched between the glass panels of your patio door. Most however should be self-installable with tracks for the panels screwing into the doorway above and sometimes below the patio door."

Decorate your patio doors with plantation shutters for a gorgeous farmhouse look. Plantation shutters are more expensive, but stylish and can open and close separate from your French doors or plain glass patio doors or they can be set on a track similar to sliding glass door tracks. Plantation shutters are much like blinds in light control and privacy but are also more sturdily set, easier to clean, and are more durable.

Sliding door panels act almost as another door, but one that\u2019s separate from the door itself to allow for light control and privacy.

Once again, one of these additions can be a valance, or a drapery added over the door to add visual interest. You can even add a curtain to go with the shades, depending on your choice in shades. Adding Side Door Panels Coordinate your side door panels with the materials and colors of your patio door. The windows on these panels should be the same style, have the same framing, and be painted the same color. Installing these panels is an extensive and expensive process, but the stylishness and visual interest they add might just be worth it to you. It would be a good idea to also give these windows the same window treatment as you give the patio door. Keep in mind that adding side door panels will be an expensive remodeling process, so the final decision you make will likely be a final one, or at least a long-term one. Choose a side door panel that will have a permanently closed window for decoration and lighting. It\u2019s nice to have the extra windows to let in extra light and one that stays permanently closed is more practical to spruce up with frost glass designs that fit your themes. If your patio door windows have little or no designs or staining on them, do this sparingly with the side door panel windows to maintain design and color coordination. Install a side door panel with a window that opens. What\u2019s even nicer with the extra light that comes with the extra windows is the option to open them to allow a breeze to flow in. It is less practical to include designs and staining in the glass of a window that opens because a window meant to move is more vulnerable to breaking. Designed and stained windows aren\u2019t as easy to replace because designs go out of production and are expensive to reproduce.",
