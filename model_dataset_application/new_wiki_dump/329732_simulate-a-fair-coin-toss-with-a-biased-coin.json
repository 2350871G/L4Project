Flip the coin twice.  If both tosses gave the same outcome, or if either toss landed on its edge or did something else not accounted for in steps 2 and 3, don't count either toss and redo step 4.  If you got heads before tails, count it as heads. If you got tails before heads, count it as tails. Since these two outcomes for a pair of tosses each have probability p*q, you have a fair coin toss.
