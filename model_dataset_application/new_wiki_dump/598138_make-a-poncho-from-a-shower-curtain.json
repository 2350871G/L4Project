Run it through the washing machine with small and soft items like hand towels, wash cloths, socks, etc.--The little items will \"scrub\" away the soap scum and residue, leaving a nicely clean plastic liner. To use less water, you can also try soaking the shower curtain in a bleach solution, then scrubbing it with a brush as needed. Hang to dry."
