Look for a lever-like valve near the inlet and outlet tubes of the water softener. There will usually be 2 labels that say \u201cbypass\u201d and \u201cservice,\u201d or something similar, as well as an arrow showing which setting it is on.Tip: Some single-valve bypasses consist of a plastic knob instead of a lever-type handle.

This could be in the basement or garage of the building and is typically near where the water heater is located. Turn the valve to the \u201cbypass\u201d position to shut off soft water service. Rotate the lever handle 90 degrees until the arrow indicates that it is set to bypass. Make sure it is turned all the way to bypass so you know that the softener service is completely turned off. The inlet and outlet valves for the water softener will now be shut and water will not be directed through the water softener. Return the valve to the \u201cservice\u201d position to start softening water again.

Double-check that it is turned as far as it can go in that direction to ensure service is fully on. This will open the inlet and outlet valves again and redirect water through the water softener. Bypassing with a Push-Type Valve Look for the push-knob near the tubes running off the softener. Find the 2 large inlet and outlet tubes at the back or on the side of the water softener. Locate a push knob labeled with \u201cbypass\u201d or \u201con/off.\u201dTip: Some push-push-type valves have colored knobs indicating which setting it is on. Typically, if the blue or green knob is pushed in it means the service is on, and if the red or black knob is pushed in it means the service is off. There are 2 main types of push valves.

If you have a push-push valve, you will see a knob move out on the other side as you push the knob in from 1 side. Pull the knob out or push it in from the other side to turn the service back on. Push the knob in from the other side if you have a push-push valve. Pull the knob back out if you have a push-pull valve. Double-check the labels to ensure that the push-knob is in the \u201con\u201d or \u201cservice\u201d position.",
