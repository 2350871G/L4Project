To make it, you'll need Jagermeister, elderflower cordial, rosemary and lime to garnish, and apple juice. The Jagermeister Fresh Orange uses orange juice. To make it you'll need: Jagermeister, crushed ice, orange zest, and, you guessed it, orange juice. The Stag Punch makes uses of lemonade. You'll need Jagermeister, Amaretto, Chambord, Red Wine, lemon juice, a dash of Grenadine, strawberries, slices of orange and lemon to garnish, and then to fill the drink with lemonade."
