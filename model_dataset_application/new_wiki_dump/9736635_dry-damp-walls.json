To deal with minor pipe damage, try resealing the pipe with epoxy putty. For major pipe damage and broken water appliances, you may need to strip out and replace the fixture entirely. For safety, hire a professional pipe repair service to deal with leaks located inside your wall. If you live in a housing complex, the water damage may have come from one of your neighbors."

          "description":"Depending on the severity of the water damage, your wall may contain a significant amount of standing water. To check, drill a small hole into the wall about 2 in (5.1 cm) off the ground and see if water comes out. If any does, drill small holes along the wall to drain the water. Keep your holes about 2 in (5.1 cm) off the ground and space them so that they are between 16 and 24 in (41 and 61 cm) apart. Before creating your holes, locate the studs inside your wall. For the best possible results, drill in the area between these spots."

Contact a certified wall repair service if you spot:\nBlack patches or streaks on drywall. Warped spots on wood walls. Cracks, blisters, or discolored areas on wood walls or drywall. Rusted or warped spots on metal stud walls. Chipped, bowed, or dissolved spots on brick or stone walls."

To do so, place 1 or more fans in front of each damp spot and turn the fans to their highest setting. This will help clear out moist air while actively drying the damp spots. Turn on your fan's oscillation function if you need to target multiple areas of the wall with 1 fan."

Using the manufacturer's included instructions, hook the device up in the same room as your damp wall. Make sure to close the room's doors and windows, then run the device. Heavy-duty dehumidifiers start at around $230 for a 50 pint unit. Look for dehumidifiers at home improvement and home appliance stores."

On average, it costs between $3.75 and $7.00 to clean up 1 sq ft (0.093 m) of moisture damaged wall.
