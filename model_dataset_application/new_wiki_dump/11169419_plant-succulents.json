          "description":"Terracotta works well for succulents because it's porous, allowing water to seep out through the pot. A shallow pot is fine because succulents don't have deep roots, but if you get a taller pot, it's not a huge issue. In fact, a tall pot can be good if you get a lot of rain, as it provides more space to draw the water from the succulents' roots. Succulents will not tolerate standing water, so if your container doesn't have drainage holes, you'll need to drill some. Keep in mind that the succulent will be contained by the size of the pot. That is, if you choose a big pot, it will get much bigger, but if you keep it in a smaller pot, it will generally stick to that size."

          "description":"Succulents do best with well-drained soil. Find a pre-mixed potting soil labeled for succulents and cacti, which should serve your plants' needs well. Typically, it will have a higher percentage of inorganic material like perlite, pumice, or crushed lava than a regular potting mix. Put a paper towel or mesh in the bottom so the soil doesn't spill out of the drainage holes, and then fill the container up about two-thirds of the way. If you can't find one specifically for succulents and cacti, pick one that's labeled \"fast\" or \"quick\" draining. To make your own mix, combine 50% regular potting soil and add 50% crushed lava, perlite, or pumice."

Arrange the smaller plants around the bigger one, grouping similar plants together. Don't dig holes; just set the plants on top of the soil. However, don't overcrowd the pot. Give the succulents some breathing room so they can get the nutrients they need to thrive. Allow at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) between plants. Group succulents together that have similar growth requirements. For instance, put ones together that require the same amount of sun or that are from the same region, meaning they grow in similar conditions."
