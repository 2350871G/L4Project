Starting with a blank slate will get you in the mindset of creating that perfect, clean, and comfortable bedding experience. It will also help you make your bed correctly, going step by step."

Nothing is quite as relaxing as slipping under crisp clean sheets when it\u2019s time for bed.

          "description":"Gather up all your bedding and place it together next to your bed. Try making stacks of similar items keeping everything organized and increasing your workflow. For example, stack your bedding in order of when you need it. Put all your sheets together first. Keep all your pillow cases together and close to your pillows. You may also want to iron your bedding like your sheets and pillow cases. Ironing will get rid of any wrinkles and creases, allowing you to experience a smooth crisp flat surface to rest on. When it comes to the type of bedding you need to make a hotel-quality bed, it's largely personal preference. To start, get the right size bedding. If you have a Queen sized bed, get Queen sized bedding. The weight of your duvet and duvet cover are also preference. However, hotels typically use a medium-weight feather down. Thread count will somewhat factor in how comfortable your sheets are. But the type of material and thread length of thread are the real factors. Sheets with a thread count between 500 and 800 are generally considered to be more of a premium quality. When looking for sheets, pure 100 percent Egyptian cotton will be the softest and likely most expensive. 100 percent Pima cotton will also be extremely comfortable, though not quite the same quality as Egyptian cotton. Look for bedding that also has a longer thread. Shorter threads can poke out of the stitching and feel scratchy."

Press down firmly and go over the top and size of your mattress. If you have stains, you can use an upholstery stain remover. Vacuuming and lifting stains from your mattress will also rid it of dust mites and odors which could otherwise cause allergies and affect your quality of sleep. You\u2019ll feel a lot better and more comfortable knowing that there\u2019s nothing gross under your fitted sheet."
