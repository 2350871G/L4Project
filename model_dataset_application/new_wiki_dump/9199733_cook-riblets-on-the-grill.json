  "text":" Grilling Riblets at a Higher Temperature Pre-heat one side of the grill to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have a gas grill, set one side of the grill to medium heat.

Pre-heating only one side of the grill is referred to as indirect grilling. Indirect grilling is best for tougher cuts of meat like ribs and riblets. Place the riblets on the grill bone-side down. Once the grill is heated, place the riblets on the other side of the grill away from the heat source. Close the lid. Cook the ribs for two hours. Do this with the lid closed. If you are unsure about the temperature, check the riblets after 30 minutes. If the riblets closest to the heat are cooking faster, rotate them. Keep rotating them every 30 minutes. Brush both sides of the riblets with sauce. After the riblets have cooked for two hours, begin brushing them with sauce. Generously brush the meat side of the riblets with a prepared sauce.

Letting the riblets rest will help keep the juices inside the meat, producing a juicer riblet. Slow-Grilling Riblets Pre-heat one side of the grill to 225 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have a gas grill, set one side of the grill to low heat. If you have a charcoal grill, pile the coals on one side of the grill. Light and heat the charcoals to 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius). Place the riblets on the grill bone-side down.

Let them rest for five to ten minutes. Let the riblets rest on the platter for five to ten minutes. After the riblets have finished resting, serve them with a side of sauce. Making a BBQ Sauce Heat olive oil and butter in a large pan. Place 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of butter and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil in a large pan. Place the pan on the stove and set the heat to medium high. Add one cup (240 ml) of chopped onion. Once the oil is heated and the butter has melted, add the chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 the onions for five minutes, or until soft. Add four cloves of minced garlic. Once the onions are soft, add the garlic. Saut\u00e9 the garlic for one minute, or until fragrant.

Mix the ingredients together until they are well combined. Simmer the sauce for one to one and a half hours. Turn the heat down low to a simmer. Let the sauce simmer uncovered for one to one and a half hours, or until it has thickened. Remove the sauce from the heat. After the sauce has thickened, remove it from the heat. Let it cool.
