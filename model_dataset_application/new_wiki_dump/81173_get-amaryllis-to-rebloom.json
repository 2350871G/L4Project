They are no longer useful at this point, and should be cut back to within 2 inches (5 cm) of the bulb. Be careful not to cut the leaves or the top of the bulb. Only the flower stalks should be removed. Do not be alarmed if sap runs out of the cut. This is normal for a well-watered plant."

If this is the case, move the plant to a windowsill with indirect sunlight to let it adjust to increased sunlight. Pick a spot that is bright and receives lots of sunlight, but not by direct exposure. You may skip this step if the plant was already exposed to indirect or full sunlight. In the northern hemisphere, north and east facing windows receive indirect sunlight. In the southern hemisphere, south and east facing windows do. Make sure to keep the plant relatively cool, too, at about room temperature. This is around or slightly warmer than 60 degrees F."

Don't let the soil dry out completely, at least not for longer than a few hours. You\u2019ll want to keep the soil just slightly moist at all times.

Bury it so the rim is at or just above the surface. Select a location that receives full morning light if possible, but is protected from sun during the hottest part of the day. Amaryllis plants grow better in containers, which also protect against burrowing animals and insects. Growing them directly in the soil is possible, but will be more difficult.

While it is not difficult to get an amaryllis to rebloom, you may have a larger, healthier plant if you use a special potting mix. Amaryllis roots are easily harmed during transplanting, so if you are not used to transplanting flowers you may wish to replace the top 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of soil instead. The best soil for amaryllis consists of two parts loamy soil, without much sand or clay; one part perlite or gravel; and one part organic matter such as rotted manure, peat, leaf mold, or composted bark. A clay pot might be better than a plastic one, since the amaryllis can become top-heavy and tip a lightweight pot over. If you are replanting the amaryllis in your garden, remove any dead leaves and peel off the bulb sheaths. Place the plant in the soil with the bulb shoulders exposed, and give it a drink of water.
