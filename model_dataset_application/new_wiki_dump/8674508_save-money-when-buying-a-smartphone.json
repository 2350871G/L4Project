Often, carriers will try to lure you into a contract by making the phone seem inexpensive. It's important to understand that the cost of the phone is often built into the contract. For instance, one carrier may offer the phone for \"free\" with a two year service contract, but charge $80/month for service. Meanwhile, another may charge you $300 for the phone if you sign a two year contract that costs $40/month. In the long run, the second option costs less ($300+$960 over two years = $1,260, compared to $1,920 over two years), though you have to pay more up front."
