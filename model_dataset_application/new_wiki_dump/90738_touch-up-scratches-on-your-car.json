          "description":"The proper way to touch up a scratch is best determined by the depth and severity of the scratch. In a well lit area, inspect the scratch. Determine how many layers of paint the scratch has penetrated. If it is just through the clear coat, you may be able to buff it out. If it is down to metal, the process will be different. Look for signs of bare metal or any rust that may have developed on the scratch. Scratches in the clear coat can be buffed out, whereas scratches through the paint will need new paint applied."

          "description":"Automotive touch up paint comes in a wide variety of colors, so the best way to find the right replacement paint is to look for the paint code in your car\u2019s owner\u2019s manual. Once you have the paint code, you can purchase touch up paint with the identical code and rest assured that they will match. Heavily faded vehicles may not match with their original paint code, but this shouldn\u2019t be an issue for small touch ups. You may also be able to find your car\u2019s paint code inside the driver\u2019s door on the same panel as the VIN number.

          "description":"Use 120 grit sandpaper to sand away any rust that has developed on the paint or metal. Be extremely careful with where you use the sand paper to avoid damaging the surrounding paint unnecessarily. Remove all rust from the metal before repairing a scratch, otherwise the rust will continue to spread beneath the touch up paint. If the rust has penetrated the metal, that panel will need to be professionally repaired or replaced."

The shade will allow you to choose how to light the area to best identify and repair the scratches, as well as keeping things like soap from drying on the paint. Allowing soap to dry on the paint will dull its finish and possibly damage the paint. Direct sunlight could make the metal on the car hot, which isn\u2019t optimal for applying touch up paint."

The primer will prevent rust from developing beneath the surface of the paint, as well as providing a good surface to apply the touch up paint to.

If the scratch is fairly small, try dabbing the paint onto the scratch and allowing it to spread and settle on its own. Dabbing the paint often yields the flattest finished product. A toothpick may work for thinner scratches. Most automotive touch up paints will not require multiple layers."

          "description":"Once the primer and the touch up paint have both dried, you may want to add a layer of clear coat. Because most clear coat comes in a spray can, it\u2019s important that you take steps to prevent over-spray, or accidentally applying clear coat to areas you didn\u2019t intend to. To prevent this, cut a hole through a piece of cardboard and hold it between the can of clear coat and the scratch, then use the cardboard to help direct the flow of the clear coat spray. Unlike a nozzle, the hole in the cardboard will allow the clear coat to mist onto the surface of the paint, rather than striking it as a jet and dripping. Immediately dab up any dripping clear coat with a clean rag."
