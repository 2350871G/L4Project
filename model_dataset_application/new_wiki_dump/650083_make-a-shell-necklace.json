The shells and necklace style you choose are a matter of personal preference, so feel free to experiment. Before drilling holes in the shells, arrange them on a flat surface so you can see how they\u2019ll look together as a necklace. To make a pendant necklace, choose a medium shell with an interesting shape or color. You can also decorate a pendant necklace with smaller shells, but make sure they match or complement the design, color, and shape of the centerpiece. Another option is to create a bold necklace with lots of medium-sized shells, which can either be distributed evenly around a cord or clustered together at the bottom."

To create a piece of fine art, choose a metal chain in gold or silver. For a more rustic piece of jewelry, try twine or linen cord. For a durable and versatile necklace, try jewelry wire or nylon line.

          "description":"To make your necklace, you will need a drill with a one-sixteenth-inch (1.6 mm) drill bit, jewelry findings, and needle nosed pliers. In case you don\u2019t have a drill, you can use a nail or screw and a hammer to make holes. Jewelry findings that you may need include jump rings to attach the shells to the cord, and a clasp mechanism to close the necklace. Findings are optional if you're using string or cord, as you can choose to wrap the cord and tie the necklace instead. With metal necklace chains, you likely won\u2019t have to worry about a clasp, as this will already be attached."

          "description":"In order to string your shells onto a cord, you will need to create a hole in each shell. Use a marker or pencil to mark the spot on each shell where you want it to attach to the cord. Hold the shell against a flat surface and use light pressure to drill a small hole in the shell. Start drilling on the inside and work your way out. If you don\u2019t have a drill, make an initial hole by using a hammer to gently tap the head of a screw or nail through the shell. Once you have a small hole, turn the head of the nail or screw back and forth inside the hole until it\u2019s large enough to accommodate the jump ring or your twine."

          "description":"Using jump rings is optional, but it will help your shells hang properly on the cord. Grab the pliers and a jump ring, and use the pliers to stretch the jump ring open. Loop the ring through the hole in a shell, then close the ring with the pliers. Repeat this step for every shell you'll be stringing on your necklace. For added interest, you can hang more than one shell, charm, or bead on each jump ring."

Then decorate the remaining cord any way you like, using other shells, charms, beads, and jewels. Or if you prefer, you can also leave the remaining cord empty, which will bring more focus to the accent piece. While your necklace doesn\u2019t have to be symmetrical, it should be balanced. For instance, instead of matching a large shell on one side with a large shell on the other, consider balancing the large shell with two or three small shells."

Otherwise, you can finish the necklace by adding a clasp:\nOn each end of the necklace, attach a crimp, followed by the clasp end. Loop the excess cord or wire back through the crimp. Pull it tightly so the clasp and crimp are touching, and are butted up firmly against the final bead or shell. Continue holding the excess cord firmly as you use the pliers to crimp the metal crimp in place. Use scissors or wire cutters to cut the excess cord."

Finish preparing the shells by doing the following:\nUse the pliers to attach a jump ring to each of the 10 smaller shells. Do not close the jump rings yet.

To start, cut a piece of 24-gauge wire six times the length of the conical shell. Hold the wire in the center by pinching it with your index finger and thumb. Wrap the wire around the tip of your index finger and twist the two pieces together three times to form a small loop at the center of the wire. Spread the two wire ends out and position the middle of the fat top (not the pointed end) of the conical shell where the twist is. Begin wrapping the two wires around the shell at an angle, forming stripes like on a candy cane. When you\u2019ve wrapped the entire shell right down to the tip, twist the wires around each other three times to secure them in place. Separate the remaining wire ends. With the pliers, grab the tip of one wire and fold it back on itself. Then grab the folded end and roll it back on itself again. Continue doing this until you reach the twist and there's no more wire to roll. The excess wire should look like a spiral. Repeat with the other wire end."

Repeat with the 10 small shells. On the lower chain, attach three small shells to the chain on either side of the conical shell. On both sides, place the first shell two inches from the center, then the next shell another two inches from that shell, and the third shell another two inches away.

While artificial shells may not have the same natural appeal, they are better for the environment. Seashells play an important role in coastal ecosystems, and provide homes to algae, birds, and hermit crabs. Removing shells from the beach can have a detrimental impact on the creatures that rely on them. If you really want to collect your own shells, only take a couple from each beach, and never take shells from highly visited beaches where others are often collecting shells. Always inspect each shell to ensure a hermit crab hasn\u2019t claimed it for a home.

Soak the shells for anywhere from 30 minutes to 24 hours, until the leathery covering\u2014called the periostracum\u2014comes off.

Use a lint-free cloth to rub a small amount of mineral oil over each shell, and gently polish the inside and outside. Since you'll be using the shells for jewelry, another option is to protect them with a thin coat of satin-finish polyurethane varnish.
