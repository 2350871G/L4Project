  "text":" Moving the King to the Edge of the Board Move your rook at least five or six squares in any direction away from the enemy king. You don't want your rook to be captured at any point of this procedure. Move your king towards one of the four center squares. If the enemy king is blocking your own king from getting there, then move your king as close to the center as you can. Move your rook to a square that divides the board into two sections within three turns. One section should hold the enemy king and one should hold your king. The square your rook is on must also be one square away from your king. If the rook needs to move to a square that isn't bordering your king, make sure that square isn't bordering the enemy king either. Move your king to a square that still borders your rook and keeps the shortest possible path between your king and the enemy king. If the enemy king is one square away diagonally from your rook, the king should be forced to move away. Try to move your rook to a square that is both diagonal of the enemy king and still bordering your own king. If you cannot do so, then follow the next step. Move your king onto a square your rook attacks, still keeping next to your rook. Again, try to keep as close as possible to your enemy king. Repeat steps 4-6 until the opponent's king is unable to move away from the edge of the chess board.  Move your rook to the same edge of the board as the enemy king for a checkmate if the enemy king is in the corner. If the enemy king is anywhere else, choose one of the methods shown below. Making an L Shape Note the row your rook attacks to confine the enemy king to a single column.  Slide your rook in a direction on that row that passes your king. Land your rook on the edge of the board. If your opponent's king moved to the same column as your king, skip the next two steps.  Move your king one square diagonally away from the row. That square should move your king closer to your rook. Move your king one square away from the rook and repeat the last three steps if the enemy king can threaten your rook next turn. If not, proceed to the next step. Move your king back next to the rook's row so that eventually, the opposing king will have to land on a square that is in the same column as your king. Most of the time, the position will be that the two kings are two diagonal squares away from each other. Move your rook to the same edge of the board as the enemy king for a checkmate.  Making a Triangle Coordinate king and rook movements so that the enemy king can only move between two squares: the corner square and the square adjacent to the corner square.  Move the king so that he is one square diagonal of the rook, not on an edge row, and, following these guidelines, as close to the enemy king as possible.  Move your rook to the same edge of the board as the enemy king, if the enemy king is in the corner, for a checkmate.  Move your rook back one space if that is not the case, then follow the step above. ",
