They also provide a place to store ashes and debris after you burn your trash. To set up a burn barrel, turn 2 cinder blocks on their side, and place a 55 gallons (210 L) steel drum on top. To allow airflow into the drum, drill at least 20 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide holes around the entire drum, spacing them evenly around the height and circumference of the barrel. If you\u2019re going to leave your burn barrel in place for a while, you may want to drill a few holes into the bottom to let rainfall run out. Burning plastics is already dangerous, but you should never burn plastic in burn barrels. Burn barrels and other backyard incinerators trap the dioxins produced by burning plastic in the immediate area around the fire. This means you are more likely to breathe them in."

Burning your trash is a fire pit is an easy way to watch the fire and control its size. Clear a space at least 3 feet (0.91 m) in diameter of all flammable materials. Use a rake, hoe, or shovel to clear away the grass. Make an 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm)wide depression in the middle of your pit.
