          "description":"Although the fruit inside a kiwi is green (or yellow), you should avoid kiwis that have a greenish hue to their skin. Instead, pick kiwis that have goldish or dark brown skin. Kiwis with gold skin will be slightly firmer, and ones with dark brown skin will be softer."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Look for fruit that\u2019s plump.",
          "description":"Kiwis are supposed to be juicy and sweet, so look for fruit that looks full, round, and full of juice. Avoid kiwi that looks shrivelled or withered."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Inspect kiwis for bruising, blemishes, and wrinkles.",
          "description":"The skin of the kiwi should be uniform in color, and not have any dark spots, cuts, or bruises that indicate damage to the fruit. Also look over the fruit for wrinkles, which indicate moisture loss. Kiwi with bruises, cuts, or blemishes is still safe to eat. Simply cut out the blemish before eating the rest of the fruit."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Press the fruit gently to test ripeness.",
          "description":"Delicately press your thumb into the outside of the fruit. When the kiwi is ripe and ready to eat, the fruit will yield to your squeeze. The fruit should be firm but not mushy or overly soft. If the kiwi doesn\u2019t give when you press it, then it\u2019s not ripe. Unripe kiwi will be tart and hard if you try to eat it, but it will ripen if you leave it at room temperature for a few days. Overly soft or mushy kiwi is likely bruised, damaged, or overripe, so avoid these kiwis. Do not purchase or eat kiwi that\u2019s oozing juice or moldy. Mold on a kiwi may appear as a black, fuzzy green, or brown spot."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Smell the kiwi.",
          "description":"Unripe kiwi has no scent, so you can tell when a kiwi is ripe by the aroma. Bring the kiwi to your nose and inhale deeply. A mild fragrant scent indicates that the kiwi is ripe and ready to eat."

When you buy unripe kiwi, leave them on the counter at room temperature, and they will ripen over the next three to seven days. Other fruits that continue ripening after harvest include apples, bananas, plums, and apricots. There are even a few fruits, like avocados, that won\u2019t ripen unless you pick them."

          "headline":"Transfer unripe kiwis to a paper bag to ripen them faster.",
          "description":"Kiwi is a fruit that produces a gas called ethylene, which helps to ripen fruit at an accelerated pace. When you store kiwi in a paper bag, the bag traps the ethylene and ripens the fruit faster. Kiwi ripened in a bag will generally ripen twice as quickly as kiwi that\u2019s left to ripen on the counter. You can also ripen other fruit faster by storing it in a paper bag with kiwi, or another ethylene-producing fruit. Other ethylene-producing fruits include apples, bananas, cantaloupe, grapes, honeydew, mangoes, peaches, pears, potatoes, and tomatoes."

        {
          "headline":"Transfer kiwis to the refrigerator for longer storage.",

Ripe kiwi will only last on the counter for a couple of days, but will keep in the refrigerator for one to two weeks. You can also store unripe kiwi in the refrigerator for an extended period of time. Place the kiwis in a plastic bag and transfer them to the refrigerator for up to six weeks. When you want to eat the kiwis, place them on the counter for a few days to ripen."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Dehydrate them for a longer shelf life.",
          "description":"Dehydrated foods can last for years, because all of the moisture gets removed. Kiwis are best dehydrated when they are ripe but still quite firm, as they will retain a better texture. To dehydrate kiwis:\nWash, scrub, and dry the fruit\nPeel off the skin with a vegetable peeler, and remove the top and bottom stem scars\nSlice the kiwi into one-eighth to one-quarter inch (3 to 6.3 mm) slices\nArrange the slices in single layers on dehydrator trays\nDehydrate them for eight to 10 hours at 130 F (54 C)\nStore the slices in an airtight container\nSigns that your dried kiwi has spoiled include discoloration, mold, chewiness or extreme hardness, a bad odor, and flavorless."

Slice the kiwi into bite-sized chunks and spread them out on a baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the freezer overnight. Transfer the slices to an airtight container or freezer bag and return them to the freezer. Kiwi will last for up to nine months in the freezer."
