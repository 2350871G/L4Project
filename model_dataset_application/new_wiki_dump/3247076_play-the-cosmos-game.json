You can ask them for a number between one and ten to start, or, if you're playing with more than one other person, allow them to choose any number. Count the number of letters in the number that they have chosen. Tell them that that number is cosmos. For example, they might choose six.

Four is Cosmos Ask another person to choose a number, just as in the method above. Again, it can be helpful to restrict them to a number between one and ten, but it can also be more fun to let them choose any number. Count the number of letters in the number that they chose. If they chose six, which has three letters in them, the new number will be three. Tell them, \"Six is three.\" Count the number of letters in the new number. If the new number above was three (because \"six\" has three letters), this becomes the old number, and the new number will become the number of letters in the old number. Since \"three\" has five letters, the new number is five. Tell them, \"Three is five.\" Repeat until you get to four. Since five, the new number from above, has four letters, the new number is four.
