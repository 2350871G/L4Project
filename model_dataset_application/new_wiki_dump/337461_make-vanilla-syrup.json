Actual vanilla beans can be a little more expensive than liquid extracts, but the taste difference is noticeable. Use the steps below to slit a vanilla bean so you can use its flavorful insides:\nSet the vanilla bean on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to carefully split it down the middle, making two long and skinny halves. Press one half flat against the cutting board. Use the dull side of your knife to scrape the inner filling out of the bean. You may need to press down fairly hard to get it all out. Add the scrapings to your recipe in place of vanilla extract. One bean's worth of scrapings usually equals about three teaspoons (one tablespoon) of extract."

This is also a great way to use up dry, caked brown sugar from the pantry. You're dissolving it, so its starting texture doesn't matter. If you're using the basic syrup recipe above, try adding 3/4 cup of brown sugar  in addition to the two cups of white sugar. You'll also want to add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water to compensate for the extra sugar."

For example, you can try replacing part (or all) of the water in the basic syrup recipe with fruit juice to make a custom fruit flavor. A few juice ideas are below:\nOrange juice (for an orange creamsicle syrup)\nBerry juice (for berries and cream syrup)\nApple juice (for apple pie and ice cream syrup)\nMost supermarket fruit juices are quite sugary on their own, so try halving the sugar in the recipe if your fruit syrup comes out too sweet."
