Spices like cloves and pepper, and foods including green pepper, garlic, imitation vanilla, and some herbs, will have a strong, bitter taste after being frozen. Onion and paprika may also shift in flavor, and celery seasonings get stronger. Curry will also taste off and slightly musty. If you\u2019re cooking large portions to freeze for later, season lightly. You can add seasoning to your liking once the food has been defrosted and reheated."

Chill the food until it reaches refrigerator temperature. If you put hot or warm food in the freezer, it will raise the temperature inside, causing frozen foods already in the freezer to partially thaw and then refreeze. This can negatively impact the quality, taste, and texture."

Use moisture resistant wrapping materials like plastic freezer wrap, freezer paper, and heavy-weight aluminum foil.

Because of bacteria growth, it\u2019s not safe to defrost a large portion of food, use some of it, and refreeze the leftovers. The only exception is if you cook the food before you refreeze it. The heat will kill the bacteria. In general, avoid freezing more than one quart of food in a single package. The faster a dish freezes, the better the quality will be once it\u2019s thawed."

All of them work fine as long as you remove as much air as possible from the bag before you seal it up. Make sure the seal is tightly closed. Use freezer tape on packages wrapped in butcher paper. Check containers for a firm seal before putting the food in the freezer."
