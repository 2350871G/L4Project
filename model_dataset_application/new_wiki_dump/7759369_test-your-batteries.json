          "description":"As alkaline batteries go bad, zinc oxide builds up inside, making the battery bouncier. This simple drop test helps you determine new batteries from old ones. Start by taking the battery and holding it above a hard, flat surface like a metal table or marble countertop. Hold the battery vertically so the flat end faces down.For AA, AAA, C, and D batteries, hold the battery so the positive side faces up. For a 9v battery, hold it so both nodes face up and the flat end faces down. A wooden surface is not the best choice for this test. Wood absorbs more energy and items don\u2019t bounce as well."

          "description":"Look at how the battery behaves when it hits the surface. A fresh battery will plop down without bouncing. It may roll over onto its side, but won\u2019t bounce back up. An older battery will bounce up several times before falling over. Use the battery\u2019s behavior to tell if this is a fresh or old battery.Remember that if the battery bounces, this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s dead. It just means it\u2019s older and is starting to lose its charge. This is a handy test if your batteries are all mixed up and you can\u2019t tell which ones are fresher."

Then drop the two batteries next to each other and compare their bounces.Since the battery is dead, it will bounce higher than a fresh one. Compare the two bounces to determine the specific condition of the battery you're testing."

These are marked on the battery.This method works for alkaline and rechargeable lithium batteries. On AA, AAA, C, and D batteries, the negative terminal is the flat side and the positive side has a protrusion. On a 9v, the smaller, rounded terminal is positive and the larger, hexagon terminal is negative. Lithium batteries come in many shapes, so look for the markings on the battery to determine its positive and negative terminals. You can also use a multimeter for this test, but make sure you set it to measure in volts rather than amps or ohms."

Turn the knob on the front of your voltmeter to DC before taking a reading.Some voltmeters require you to pick a max level for the current you\u2019re testing. On most, the lowest setting is 20 volts. This is enough for all common batteries, so set the meter to 20 volts if it requires you to pick a level."

But the reading will be in a negative value rather than a positive one. Common household batteries won\u2019t shock you during this test, so don\u2019t worry."

If the charge is more than 1 volt below where it should be, then replace the battery. A normal charge for lithium ion batteries is 3.7 volts, but this could vary. Check with the manufacturer for the full charge. A 3.7-volt lithium battery usually stops working at 3.4 volts, so recharge or replace your battery if it s approaching this level."

For a AA, AAA, C, or D battery, set the voltage dial to 1.5V. Set the voltage to 9V for a 9v battery. Hold the black probe to the negative end of the battery and the red probe to the positive end to test the battery's milliamps.A fresh 1.5V battery will read 4 milliamps, and a fresh 9V measures 25. Readings below this indicate a dead battery. At 1.2-1.3V is typically when most 1.5V batteries start to become weak. This particular test won't work on a lithium ion battery because multimeters don't have load test settings for their voltages."

Open the slide and insert a AA, AAA, C, or D battery into the slot with the positive side touching the slide. Then check the display for the volt reading. To test a 9v, some meters have a separate port to touch the battery against for a reading. Check your meter to see if it has this feature. Some meters can also test lithium ion batteries if they\u2019re shaped like standard alkaline batteries, but not if they\u2019re irregularly shaped."
