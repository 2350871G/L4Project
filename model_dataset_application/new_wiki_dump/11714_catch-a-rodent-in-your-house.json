          "description":"There are two common types of rats. Brown rats (Norway rats) are particularly common. Their bodies are 7-10 inches long, they have gray-brown fur, and a tail that is shorter than their body. Indoors, they live in basements and lower portions of buildings. Black rats (roof rats) are smaller, with 6-8 inch bodies, darker gray or black fur, and have tails that are longer than their bodies. Indoors, they lives in attics, voids in ceilings, and the upper portions of buildings."

          "description":"Peanut butter is a great option, as it appeals to all types of rodents. Certain types of bait will also work better during certain times of the year. For rats and mice, use the kind of food they've been eating in your house as bait. For example, if a rat has been eating your dog's food, use that same dog food to bait the rat into a trap. For squirrels, use peanut butter, nuts, grains, seeds, and tender fruits and vegetables."

Rats are naturally cautious, while mice tend to be curious. Be aware of seasonal behaviors too. Trap squirrels in late spring and early winter in particular, as this can prevent breeding."

Depending on the type of trap you\u2019re using and the type of rodent you\u2019re after, different amounts of bait will be ideal. For rats, leave traps baited with a small amount of food, but not set, for a few days in a high activity area. This allows rats to become comfortable with the presence of the trap. Since mice are more curious, pre-baiting traps is usually unnecessary. Use only a very small amount of bait when trapping mice to ensure the mouse springs the trap. For squirrels, use plenty of bait, as you want to lure them fully into a live trap."

On pathways you are certain of, place two traps side by side to catch rodents that may jump over the first trap they encounter. For squirrels, place traps along the wall in the attic or crawlspace, near the bottom of the trees outside your home, and directly on your roof, especially near trees or power lines that may be routes that squirrels take into your home."

Change the bait you\u2019re using from time to time to increase a trap\u2019s appeal. For instance, switch from one type of food to another, or, with mice, switch from food to nesting material.
