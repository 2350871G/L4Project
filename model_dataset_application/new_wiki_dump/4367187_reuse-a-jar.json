          "description":"If your jar used to contain food or other perishable items, be sure to thoroughly scrub the inside with soap and water to avoid bacterial or mold growth. Any residual odors can be removed by using baking soda and vinegar. Some odors, like sauerkraut or coffee, are more stubborn. If baking soda and vinegar did not work, you can also use soapy water combined with coarse sea salt to absorb the odor. Shake the jar vigorously for 30 seconds to abrasively clean the inside of the jar, then rinse and let the jar dry."

          "headline":"Remove the label by soaking it in water and vinegar.",
          "description":"Most labels should be removable by using a combination of water and white vinegar or washing soda. Fill your sink or a tub with the solution and submerge the jar for around 10 minutes. Some labels can take up to half an hour, but feel free to check before then. Use a sponge or steel wool to scrub off any remaining adhesive. You can also use nail polish remover or mineral spirits to remove residue from particularly stubborn labels. Another method for removing labels is to use a hair dryer and melt the adhesive behind the label with prolonged heat. This method has mixed results, however, and will only work on glass jars. This method is unsuitable for plastic containers as they would melt under the heat."

          "headline":"Dry the jar with a towel.",
          "description":"Future decorations like paint, tape, or glue have limited effectiveness when applied to a wet surface. You can either dry the jar with a towel or let it air dry in sunlight or overnight. If you choose to use a towel, pay special attention to the threads at the top where water is most likely to remain. Drying a jar in sunlight has the added bonus of potentially removing any leftover odor that you missed."

          "description":"Glass is a tricky material, so some types of paint will work better than others. For best results use \u201cglass paint\u201d - also known as acrylic enamel paint. This type of paint will stick more strongly to glass than others and will also dry with a glossy sheen that resists scratching and peeling. Other paints will work fine, but multiple coats are advised to ensure that they stick and provide ample coverage. Fully painted jars work best when you do not want or care to see the contents. When using a jar as a terrarium or flower pot, for example, you could paint over the dirt and make it so only the plants themselves are visible. It is not recommended to paint jars that you intend to use with food. Most paints are harmful when consumed, though a few select brands are considered food-safe.

These jars could be kept in a tray to prevent them from rolling around, though you could also attach them to the underside of a shelf.

The naturally heavy weight of glass jars makes them more ideal for this situation than a lighter container like a plastic cup. This method still runs the risk of tipping over and spilling the contents, but this can be avoided by either adding weight to the bottom of a jar or not storing too many items in it at a time. Jars can also be used to store safety pins, thumbtacks, staples, paper clips, and similar supplies. The advantage to storing them in a jar is that, once sealed, they cannot spill or become mixed with other supplies."

Mason jars are ideal for the pin cushion lid because the main part of the lid pops out and leaves only the rim. To make a pin cushion lid, you'll need a large circle of fabric, some stuffing, and a small circle of cardboard traced from the inside of the Mason jar. Run a needle and thread through the edges of your fabric circle. Then pull the two ends of the string like a drawstring and tighten the cloth around your stuffing. Glue your cardboard circle over the opening of your cloth bundle and then push it through the Mason jar lid from the underside. Once sealed onto the jar, this will hold your pin cushion in place and you can stick your sewing needles into the top."
