By allowing your dining table to be mostly free of decorations and clutter, you can use the space for more than just eating! You can use wax or another product with a glossy finish to keep your table gleaming and looking great."

Go for a color that compliments the dining room chairs and other decorations in the room. For example, if your chairs have blue cushions and your curtains are white, choose a table runner that includes blue and white. Swap out the tablecloth or table runner based on the season or holiday. A table runner can add a pop of color to a glass table."

          "description":"The centerpiece will help the table look interesting while still keeping it clean and empty. Choose your centerpiece size based on the size of your table, and place it on top of the table runner or table cloth. For a contemporary feel, put a metal or clay sculpture in the middle of the table. The centerpiece shouldn\u2019t be too tall, though! If it is, make sure you can easily move it out of the way when serving dinner or entertaining guests."

During the holidays, put string lights in the jars with glass ornaments to create a festive look. Put several jars in a row or on a tray in the middle of the table.

You can choose to have the vase be the focal point or use a variety of colors and shapes of flowers to create a unique arrangement. Simple greenery, like Baby\u2019s Breath or succulents, also look great. If you have a long table, consider using 3 or 5 smaller vases of flowers and spreading them out in a line down the middle of the table."
