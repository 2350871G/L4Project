          "description":"A great way to get inspiration for winter birthday party activities is to think first about what you want your theme to be. Then, you can think of activities that go well with your theme. Some examples of themes with corresponding activities include:\n\u201cArt Party\u201d: Create drawings, paintings, and sculptures. You can even host a contest, choose judges, and have small prizes for the winners. Consider also making something the party guest will use, like a painted tote bag or t-shirt. \u201cNostalgic Disney Party\u201d: Every one loves remember their favorite classic Disney movies. Play Disney Scene It! and trivia, and marathon watch old Disney movies. \u201cWinter Wonderland\u201d: If you live somewhere snowy, take advantage of it. Go sledding and have a snowman-building contest. You can even try to build a fort from snow. Just make sure all your guests  bring their snow gear. \u201cBaking Party\u201d: Use premade cakes or cookies, and let everyone decorate their own with icing, fondant, and sprinkles. Watch shows like Cake Boss to inspire your sweet creations. \u201cDance Competition\u201d: Put on some music, and see who can come up with the best moves. Play dancing games on your Xbox or Wii, if you have one, to make it a bit more structured. Watch and comment on dancing shows like Dance Moms, So You Think You Can Dance, or Dancing with the Stars, when you get tired of dancing yourself. \u201cIndoor Scavenger Hunt\u201d: Scavenger hunts are fun and versatile. Make clues in advance and hide them around the party venue. Break guests up into teams. See who can follow the clues to the hidden prize first. \u201cDreaming of Summer\u201d: Having a sunny indoor party when it\u2019s cold and gray can be a lot of fun. Have beach chairs for your guests to sit on, and let everyone wear flower necklaces. Play summery music, like Jimmy Buffet or the Beach Boys. Turn up the heat, and tell everyone to bring beach clothes. Watch a classic surf movie. \u201cSpa Party\u201d: Throw a spa party, and pamper all your guests. Do each other\u2019s nails and hair. Make homemade face masks. Light scented candle. Give everyone a gift bag with make up or a sleep mask. \u201cMurder Mystery\u201d: Having a murder mystery party can be a great way to make your entire party into a game. You can buy a premade game, download a free one, or make up your own. Give all your guests a character, and send them a small description of that character before the party. Tell them to dress up like the character. Throughout the party, as your characters, you and your guests will have to ask each other questions to determine who the murderer is."

After you build your fire, make sure your have sand and water on hand to put it out once the party is over. Keep a stack of wood handy to stoke the fire during the party. Provide blankets. Even though you\u2019ll have a fire, it can be nice to have a bunch of wool blankets on hand to keep your guests comfortable. If you don\u2019t have enough blankets, ask the party guests to bring their own. If you know someone who plays guitar, ask them to bring their guitar so they can play songs around the fire."
