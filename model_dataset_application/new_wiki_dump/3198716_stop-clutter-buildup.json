They might be good for the price you are paying for, but can you exist without that thing? If yes, you are buying clutter! Don't even bring it into your home."

The earlier you donate, the less clutter will build up. For kids unwilling to clear up, you can make a game out of who can donate the most old items, or reward them with a small gift or treat if they clear out a certain number of items."
