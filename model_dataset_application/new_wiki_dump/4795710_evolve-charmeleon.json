As a Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon, it is weak against Ground and Rock-types, such as Onix and Dugtrio, and Water-types, like Squirtle and Gyarados. Charmeleon will take twice the damage from these types as it normally gets from other types. If you use Charmeleon against these Pok\u00e9mon, you'll have a hard time winning, thus reducing the experience points (XP) you can gain for every battle."

Rare Candies are in-game items that increases your Pok\u00e9mon's level by 1 point instantly. You can get Rare Candies by completing missions or from inside Battle Towers (available only for the newer versions of the game)."
