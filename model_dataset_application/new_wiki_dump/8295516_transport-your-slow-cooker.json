To ensure that food does not spoil during transport, it is best to make sure the food is hot and ready to serve. Food should not dip below a temperature of 165 degrees fahrenheit (74 degrees celsius). Bring a thermometer so that you can check the temperature of the food throughout transportation and before serving."

In order to prevent spills, secure the lid to the slow cooker. This can be done in a number of different ways:\nPurchase a slow cooker that has a clamp on lid making it easy to seal the contents during transit. Secure the lid using painters tape. Simply tape the lid to the sides of the crockpot. Do this on all four sides. Use elastic bands to secure the lid. Wrap an elastic band around the handle of the slow cooker and then loop it around the handle on the lid. Do the same thing with the handle on the other side of slow cooker."
