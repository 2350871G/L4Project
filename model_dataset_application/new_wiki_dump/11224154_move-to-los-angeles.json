          "description":"Write down the cost of your current expenses to see how much you\u2019re regularly spending on rent, utilities, groceries, and other recurring charges. Compare the amount that you spend to your current income to see how much money you\u2019re able to comfortably spend each month. Determine what you can afford per month for rent so you can start looking for places in LA. The average rent in LA is usually around $1,000-1,300 per person depending on what neighborhood you choose to live in. Try to save up at least 3 times your monthly expenses before you move to LA in case you aren\u2019t able to find a job immediately. That way, you can still afford your costs of living."

Check for restaurants and locations in the neighborhoods that interest you so you know what you\u2019ll be close to. Write down a few different neighborhoods where you want to live so you can search for places in the area. If you want to be near the ocean, then look in neighborhoods like Venice or Manhattan Beach. For a more traditional big city living, choose to look Downtown for places to live. If you want a safe area with lots of things to do, try looking in Silver Lake or Glendale. Choose places in the Valley, like Studio City or Burbank, to be close to the entertainment industry. Areas like Chesterfield Square and Compton are less safe than other neighborhoods to the north.

When you find homes you like, save them and contact the landlord or owner as soon as you can to set up a showing and learn more about the property. Prices for housing will vary depending on the neighborhood you choose. For example, apartments in Manhattan Beach may be over $2,000 USD a month per person, but a similar one may only cost $1,300 USD per person in Palms. Modest homes usually cost around $800,000 USD, which includes 2 bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a living space.Tip: Check what utilities and appliances are included with the rent price since you may have to pay them separately.

Many 1-way trips on the bus or Metro cost $1.75 USD, but you can buy unlimited monthly passes for about $100 USD. You can also use rideshare apps to get around without driving, but you may still get caught in traffic. Learn the highway numbers so you don\u2019t get lost. Look at a map of Los Angeles and note all of the major highways that run through it. Refer to the highways by their number rather than their name since that\u2019s how most locals will refer to them. Write down what major roads connect to the highways so you\u2019re able to get around even if you don\u2019t have a GPS. For example, rather than calling I-10 the \u201cSanta Monica Freeway,\u201d you would call it \u201cthe 10.\u201d Looking for Things to Do Make new friends by visiting local events and attending meetups. Check online for free events happening in your area to see what you can attend. Check on local meet-up apps to meet people with similar hobbies or to try something new with a group of people. Be open to the new experiences so you can connect with others and meet friends you can hang out with later. Use social media sites to check what events are happening nearby so you can plan ahead of time. Ask employees at stores and restaurants about cool things in the area to see if they have any information. Try new restaurants and different cuisines in your area. Los Angeles has a variety of restaurants from many different cuisines, so search for the type of food you want to eat and check what places are in your area and easy to get to. Look at their menus and reviews to determine if you want their food before going to their location. Try different foods you weren\u2019t able to before to expand your tastes. You can also order delivery for many restaurants through apps like Grubhub or Postmates, though it could take a little while depending on the traffic when you order. Certain neighborhoods may have more restaurants from particular cuisines. For example, Little Tokyo has many Japanese restaurants while Chinatown has many Chinese restaurants. Go hiking to see the Hollywood sign. Los Angeles has miles of hiking trails near the Hollywood sign and the Griffith Observatory that are free for the public to use. Be sure to wear sunscreen while you\u2019re hiking so you don\u2019t get a sunburn, and bring snacks and water with you. Follow the trail signs to the Hollywood sign for a great photo op and workout! If you don\u2019t want to hike, many places also offer horseback tours of the trails. While the hiking trails are free, you may need to pay for parking when you first arrive. Attend free tapings of TV shows for a chance to be on TV. Many TV shows film in Los Angeles and offer free tickets to be in the studio audience. Look online for audience opportunities near you and choose a show that you\u2019re interested in. While you\u2019re  in the audience, participate actively and pay attention to any special rules or regulations they have. Taping times depend on the length of the show and how many reshoots they need to do, but they can last up to around 4 hours. Many websites offer newsletters so you can learn when new shows are taping. Visit museums and attractions around Los Angeles to see the art and culture. Los Angeles has many different museums and attractions about history and art, so search online for a few that interest you. Look at what exhibitions they\u2019re currently hosting and check their hours so you know when the best time to visit is. Spend as much time at the museums as you need to learn more about the area and experience LA culture. Some popular attractions in Los Angeles include the Getty Art Museum, the La Brea Tar Pits, the Museum of Natural History, and the LA Zoo.Tip: Many museums and attractions have free days where you can go in without an admission charge. Spend time at the beach if you want to be near the ocean. The southern Californian coast has multiple beaches to choose from, so look for one that interests you or has nearby attractions so you can spend the day there. Lay in the sun, swim in the ocean, or just relax outdoors to unwind. Be sure to wear sunscreen and reapply it or else you will get burnt. While Venice Beach is popular, it can get crowded with tourists and may not be the most relaxing.",
