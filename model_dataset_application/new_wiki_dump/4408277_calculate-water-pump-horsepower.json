Ignore any horizontal distance. If the water level changes over time, use the maximum expected distance. This is the \"pumping lift\" your pump will need to generate. Example: When the gardener's water tank is nearly empty (the lowest expected level), its water level is 50 feet below the area of the garden that needs watering."

          "headline":"Estimate friction losses from the pipe.",
          "description":"Besides the minimum pressure needed to move water a certain distance, your pump also needs to overcome the force of friction as the water moves through the pipe. The amount of friction depends on the pipe's material, internal diameter, and length, as well as the type of bends and fittings you use. Look up these values on a pipe friction loss chart such as this one. Write down the total friction loss in feet of head (meaning the number of feet you \"lose\" from your pumping lift because of friction). Example: The gardener decides to use 1\" diameter plastic pipes, and needs 75 ft of pipe total (including horizontal lengths). A pipe friction loss chart tells him that 1\" plastic pipes cause a loss of 6.3 ft of head for every 100 ft of pipe length.75ft\u22176.3fthead100ft=4.7fthead{\\displaystyle 75ft*{\\frac {6.3ft_{head}}{100ft}}=4.7ft_{head}}He also looks up the friction loss from each fitting in the pipe. For 1\" plastic, one 90\u00ba elbow connector and three threaded fittings contribute a total loss of 15 ft.Adding this all together, the total friction loss is 4.7 + 15 = 19.7 ft., or about 20 ft. These charts often include an estimate of water velocity as well, based on flow rate and the pipes you use. It's best to keep velocity below 5 ft / s to prevent \"water hammer,\" the repeated knocking vibration that can damage your equipment."

          "description":"The vertical distance water needs to travel plus the friction losses from the pipe make the \"total dynamic head\" or TDH. This is the total pressure load the pump needs to overcome. Example: TDH = vertical distance + friction loss = 50 ft + 20 ft = 70 ft."

If you are pumping a different fluid, look up its \"specific gravity\" online or in an engineering reference book. Fluids with a higher specific density are denser, and require more horsepower to push through the pipe. Example: Since the gardener is pumping water, he doesn't need to look anything up. Water's specific gravity is equal to 1."

Once you have chosen a pump, check the manufacturer's info for the pump's efficiency and write it as a decimal. Divide the water horsepower by this value to find the actual horsepower of the motor you need for your pump.
