Cut the end off the light bulb. Take your knife to cut off the metal tip of the light bulb where you would typically screw it into the socket. Try to cut it smoothly to avoid rough edges. Remove the filament. Use the pliers to pull the filament out of the bulb. The filament is the metal wire that lights up the bulb when turned on.
