Starting from the fourth generation, the in-game time depends on your device\u2019s clock or the real-world time. nighttime in the game starts at 8:00 PM and ends on 3:59 AM. If you want the night to come faster, you can adjust your device\u2019s system clock."

You can do any kind of Pok\u00e9mon battle (either fighting trainers or wild Pok\u00e9mon) as long as Chingling wins and gain XP. Once Chingling levels up, it will evolve into its adult form: Chimecho. If Chingling doesn\u2019t evolve, make sure that its Happiness level is at least 220. You can max out the Happiness level (255) just to make sure."
