Since the buyer will be performing all of their hygiene in these places, it\u2019s critical that they don\u2019t find anything that might gross them out. Mix up your own all-purpose cleaner using a combination of liquid castile soap, baking soda, and your choice of fragrant essential oils. Be sure to get into the tiniest cracks and crevices and use a little elbow grease. Even the most inconspicuous spots are likely to be given a once-over at some point. Don\u2019t forget to clean the floor vents, light fixtures, and other areas where dust and cobwebs can build up."

For bathrooms with tile floors, you can treat light discoloration and renew grout by scrubbing it with a paste made from baking soda and water.

Consider purchasing a couple smaller storage solutions, such as a wicker basket for bath towels or a small decorative cart to display your soaps, lotions, and oils. That way, everything won\u2019t all be crammed into one place. If you really want to go the extra mile, group your stored items together by function and color.

For instance, remove all but your best 6 towels from the linen closet, then roll or fold the 6 towels and arrange them nicely."
