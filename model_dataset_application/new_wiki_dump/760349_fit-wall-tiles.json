If a narrow strip is left at the top, move the bottom row up by half a tile width to give an even finish. Mark out the horizontal rows with pencil \u2013 be sure to use a spirit level to ensure they\u2019re horizontal. Tack the batten along first pencil line so that the tiles can be positioned against it.
