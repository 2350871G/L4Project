If you don't have a dishwasher, wash the inner pot by hand, using warm water and dish soap. Use baking soda to remove burnt food. Fill the inner pot with water and add 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of baking soda. Cook this on low heat for a couple of hours. Leave the solution to cool, pour it down the drain, and then use some more baking soda to gently scrub off the remaining burnt food.
