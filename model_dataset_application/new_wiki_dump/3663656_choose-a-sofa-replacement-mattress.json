A spring mattress can get deformed and uncomfortable when stored inside the body of the sofa; as it just isn\u2019t designed to be folded and stored for long periods of time. On the other hand, a foam sofa mattress has a high resiliency, thanks to its innate ability to form and shape itself into any situation. Once the sofa bed is opened up for use, the foam mattress springs back into its original shape, perfect for sleeping, thus making the foam mattress the better choice for sofas.
