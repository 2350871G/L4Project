      "headline":"Equip the motion sensor.",
      "description":"It's recommended that you equip the motion sensor and the SVD, or for non-lethal kills you can use the Mosin Nagent/EZ Gun/MK22. As an alternative to the motion sensor, use the thermal goggles. Do not equip any weapon at the start of the fight. The Boss will use Close Quarters Combat (CQC) and unless you counter it, your gun (and bones) will be broken and you will have to waste time getting the gun and ammo back."

      "headline":"Find the Boss.",
      "description":"Use the motion sensor to find out where The Boss is. If you see anything moving quickly, that's her. If you can't find her on the motion sensor, look around. She is usually peeking out behind a tree. Keep your eyes open."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Shoot her.",
      "description":"Remember that you have only 10 minutes to beat her, so aim for her head to make the most out of every shot. You will be able to shoot her three times before she falls to the floor. When that happens, run! She will use her Patriot and shoot at the spot where you shot her. Continue this until she dies."
