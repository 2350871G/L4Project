      "description":"Compost is food waste and other organic material that has decomposed. It adds nutrients to the soil and keeps organic waste from going to a landfill. Material that can be composed includes shredded paper, fruit and vegetable parings, lawn clippings, dead leaves, coffee grounds, egg shells, and leftovers of meals. Don't add meat or dairy items to a compost heap. Gather enough material for the compost heap to generate its own heat as the material decomposes. Keep the heap moist by adding water and aerate it by turning it over with a pitchfork. You can also buy a tumbling compost bin."

      "description":"Water your garden with a drip line or soaker hose. These devices water very efficiently because they target the roots of plants. Set out barrels or other containers to gather rainwater from your downspouts. Use the captured rainwater on your garden or lawn. You can also install drain pipes to take water from your home's downspouts into your garden. Eliminate your lawn or shrink the size of it. Lawns require a great deal of water to stay healthy. Make a rock garden. A garden of rocks and stones adds beauty and conserves water. Rock gardens are easier to care for than grassy lawns. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/68\\/Create-an-Eco-Garden-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Create-an-Eco-Garden-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/6\\/68\\/Create-an-Eco-Garden-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Create-an-Eco-Garden-Step-3Bullet4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

Select pesticides that target the particular insect you're wanting to kill, such as fire ants or grubs. Choose pesticides that degrade rapidly with the elements and weather. Use natural products to control bugs. For example, use the milky spore bacteria to control Japanese beetles. Attract bats by installing a bat house in your eco garden. Bats eat a large amount of mosquitoes and other pests."
