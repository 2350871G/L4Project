This way you can stay focused without the interruptions that would otherwise occur as you had to search for new materials. Depending on what kind of greeting card you plan to make, you'll need glue, scissors or a paper cutter, paper or blank cards, envelopes, small decorations to put on the card, and a pen or pencil. Buy some materials at the store to start off with when making cards. You can also recycle things around the house.

Consider using construction paper if you want a tougher material or something more colorful. If you plan on cutting your paper with a paper cutter, use a ruler to define the lines before you start cutting. This will make it easier to keep everything straight and even."

If you know the person you're giving the card to, try to make something that would appeal to them. If you're just trying to make a general card, try to decorate the card in such a way that would match the theme of the greeting. For example, if you're making a birthday card maybe you should include cakes and balloons. Another option for decorating is to use scrap book materials or other craft items.
