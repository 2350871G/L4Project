Little Sisters move around the map as you progress in the game, and rarely stay in one spot for too long. They can be identified by their Little Sister icon on the map. For a total headcount of little sisters, there is 1 in the Medical Pavilion, 3 in Neptune's Bounty, 2 in Arcadia, 1 in the Farmer's Market, 4 in Fort Frolic, 3 in Hephaestus, 2 in Olympus Heights, 2 in Apollo Square, and 3 in Point Prometheus."

          "description":"There are some Little Sisters that cannot be harvested or saved; however, those that you can harvest or save are accompanied by a Big Daddy, which act as guardians. To rescue the Little Sister, you will have to defeat the Big Daddy regardless of which ending you want. Big Daddies are arguably the toughest enemies in the game, so use caution when engaging them in combat. They will only become hostile if you attack first, so feel free to explore the level and collect any power-ups you need before attacking. Big Daddies fall into two categories: Rosies and Bouncers. Rosies are encountered in the Neptune's Bounty level. Their main attacks are shooting with the rivet gun and throwing proximity mines. You'll encounter Bouncers in the Medical Pavilion level. They charge at you with their drills, or use melee attacks. The electric Buck bullets with the rapid-fire shotgun are effective on both types of Big Daddies, as they do a lot of damage and pierce through the armor. Overall, it is best to keep your distance when fighting Bouncers, as they excel at close combat. Rosies can be beaten if you can avoid their fire and attack with armor-piercing bullets."

She will most likely be crying over his body and will not run away. Two options will appear: \u201cHarvest\u201d and \u201cRescue.\u201d Hit the \u201cRescue\u201d option by pressing the Triangle button (PS3), Y button (Xbox 360), or the L key (PC).
