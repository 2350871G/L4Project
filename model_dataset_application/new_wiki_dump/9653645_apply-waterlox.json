After, if you want a medium semi-gloss sheen, you can add more coats of this finish to achieve the desired effect. This produces a 75\u00ba gloss level immediately after finishing, which will fade to a 50-55\u00ba gloss level over the first few months after application. The gloss level is the measurement of paint sheen (how shiny/glossy the paint will be) once it\u2019s dried."

Cross-ventilation is best to aerate the room and to help the finish dry. For best results, place a box fan in a window or door with another window or door open on the opposite side of the room. You should ventilate the room while you are applying the finish and while it is drying between coats. Continue ventilating the area for at least 7 days after applying the final coat to ensure the finish is properly dried and to help evacuate the solvent odor."

This will remove any dust or debris left on the surface so that it doesn\u2019t get painted over. Consider using a shop-vac or a canister-style vacuum for best results on larger surface areas. For smaller surfaces, use a damp microfiber cloth to remove any dust particles. After vacuuming, wipe the surface with a dry rag to get up any remaining flecks or fibers that the vacuum may have missed."

Be sure to go with the grain of the wood as you sand it. Do not sand the wood too roughly or this could remove any existing protective stain. When finished sanding, wipe the surface with a rag to remove any leftover debris from the sanding process."

Rub the paint pad back and forth across the surface to be stained in approximately 1 ft (0.30 m) to 2 ft (0.61 m) sections at a time, always going with the grain of the wood. If you are finishing a rather large surface (like a floor, for example), it might be a good idea to attach the paint pad to a t-bar to make the painting job easier.

This will help you control the finish on a smaller surface than you would be able to with a paint pad, preventing drips or other stains from occurring. Keep in mind that you should always apply the finish with the direction of the wood grain, regardless of what tool you use to apply the coat."
