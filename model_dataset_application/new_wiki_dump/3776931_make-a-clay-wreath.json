  "text":" Clay wreath decoration Take a spoonful of modeling clay.  Roll it into a ball. Then pound down flatter, to spread it into a circle shape. Round the edge. Using your fingers, mold the flattened piece into a perfect circular shape. Cut a hole in the center. Use a small round object to cut out a hole from the center, in much the same way as cutting a cookie. Measure the object first to ensure there is plenty of wreath left. Cutting objects could be made from a toothpaste tube lid, a drink bottle lid, a miniature round cookie cutter, etc. Whatever you use, make sure it is clean and won't transfer drink dye or sugary stickiness onto the clay.

Thread a ribbon or piece of yarn around what is the top of the clay wreath decoration and hang it on the tree. Alternatively, hang it on your dollhouse door. Polymer clay wreath brooch Make a plain wreath from white polymer clay. Roll a ball of polymer clay to a height of about 2.5cm/1 inch. Press down on the ball to slightly flatten it. Press some more to shape it into a small circle. Press out a middle circle. Use a pencil or a bottle lid to press out a center circle. Discard this inner circle. Make small decorations around the wreath. This could be small clay flowers, berries, leaves, etc. Shape whatever designs you like but it is a good idea to decide on the design first and make a pattern from that to follow. It can help to think about whether you'd like the brooch decorations to match a particular pattern or design on a favorite outfit. If so, use that as a guide.

Pin the brooch to your outfit. Check in the mirror that the brooch is sitting straight and you're good to go. Large clay wreath Use proper art clay for making this wreath.  Roll out two lengths of clay. Ensure that they are both the same width and the same length. The length will be determined by how large you would like the wreath to be. Braid the two pieces together. Wrap them around each other until you cannot wrap any further. Smooth the ends together to form a circle. You should now have a 2-braid circle wreath shape. Bake as normal for the clay. Decide whether to leave the wreath bare or painted/glazed. This is completely up to you and the end look you'd like and your skill level. It looks fine unglazed and unpainted, so the next step will presume that's as far as you're happy to take it. Add decorative elements. Find suitable ornamentation to add to the wreath, such as large felt flowers, felt or fabric ladybugs, felt or fabric butterflies, etc. Arrange these in a nice way at various intervals around the clay wreath.

It is not recommended that a large wreath be hung from something that moves constantly, such as a door, as the banging movement of doors might break the clay.
