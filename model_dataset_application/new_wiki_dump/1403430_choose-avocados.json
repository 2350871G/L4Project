          "description":"Hass avocados are available year-round, and make up the vast majority of the avocado market. Their buttery texture is perfect for making great guacamole. Their tough skin allows you to easily dice the flesh while it\u2019s still within the skin, then scoop it out to mix with other ingredients. Because it\u2019s tough and flexible, you can also use Hass avocado skin as a creative way to scoop guacamole when you\u2019re serving it to your guests. If you\u2019re slicing avocados for a salad or to eat on their own, go with a slightly less ripe fruit than you would for guacamole. The slices will stay intact better if they\u2019re a little less ripe, allowing for better presentation."

          "description":"If you are preparing a meal containing avocados and need them immediately, choose ripe, ready-to-eat avocados. However, if you are buying the avocados in advance, you can purchase unripe fruit and let them soften at home. To ripen avocados at home, you can store them at room temperature, and they should ripen over three or four days, depending on how firm they were when you purchased them. To speed up the ripening process, place the avocados in a brown paper bag with a banana. The banana releases small amounts of ethylene gas, which helps other fruit ripen faster. To keep the avocados fresh, store them in the refrigerator."

          "description":"Avocados are often used as natural moisturizers. The oils in their flesh are what makes them desirable for use on skin. California-grown avocados tend to contain more oil, so take note of its origin when you\u2019re looking for a fruit for beauty purposes. Hass avocados are most readily available, and are certainly oily enough for use in beauty masks. Other suitable varieties include the Pinkerton, Sharwil, Anaheim, the Daily 11, and MacArthur."

          "description":"Hold the avocado in the palm of your hand. Gently squeeze the avocado, being careful not to press with your fingertips, as this can cause bruising. A ripe avocado will be soft and will yield to the gentle pressure, but will not be overly squishy. If it is still hard, then it is still under ripe and will take a few days to ripen. Avoid avocados which are overly soft and mushy, since this would mean that the fruit is too ripe. Make sure to test out the entire fruit, and don\u2019t judge ripeness by feeling the top of the avocado closest to the stem. This is the first part of the fruit to ripen, so it might be slightly softer while the rest of it is too firm. Keep in mind you may still opt to purchase firmer avocados if you\u2019re purchasing them a few days before their intended use."

          "description":"If the stem is still attached, give it a pull. If there\u2019s any resistance, the fruit is not yet ripe. If comes off easily, and the area where it was is bright green, it\u2019s perfectly ripe. If it\u2019s yellow-green, it could use a day or so before being eaten. If the area where the stem was is brown or dark green, the avocado is overripe. Checking under the stem is one of the quickest and most reliable tricks for determining ripeness, and it removes the risk of damaging fruit by poking and prodding with fingertips."

          "description":"Hass avocados, which are the type you\u2019re most likely to encounter at the grocery store, are green when unripe and dark green to near black when ripe. However, make sure you double check any signage posted at the market for the type of fruit and where it was grown. Most Florida avocados, unlike Hass, have lighter-green skin with yellowish tone, even when they are ripe. Avocados that are shiny are not yet ripe enough, but again, you can still purchase these and ripen them at home. Choose avocados with unblemished skin. Avoid fruit with dark blemishes, brown spots, dents, and bruises."

Learn which varieties are nuttier or lighter in flavor. Purchase the Hass, Lamb Hass, Gwen, Reed, or Sharwil varieties if you prefer avocados with a nutty taste. Choose the Bacon and Zutano varieties for avocados that are lighter in flavor."

          "description":"Florida varieties typically contain more water, while those grown in California and Mexico are oilier. These fattier, more oily types are best for guacamole because of their rich texture. You\u2019d also use an oily variety for skin moisturizers, while watery types are great for use in juices. These juicy types tend to have light, sweet flavors, and weigh up to five pounds. Watery varieties include the Choquette and Hall. In addition to oilier varieties, types with thicker skins, such as Hass and Gwen, are also great for beauty use. Gently rub the peel or skin against your face in soft, circular motions, then rinse with warm water. While an avocado's size doesn't directly relate to its quality, it can help you determine where the fruit comes from and whether it has a higher water or oil content. Larger avocados, some weighing up to five pounds, are typically from Florida and grow so large because of their high water content. Smaller avocados, with lower water content, are generally from California or Mexico."

If you plan on consuming a large quality of avocados or eating an avocado a day, it might be best to consider choosing varieties that are less rich. Even though two-thirds of the fat an avocado contains is mono-unsaturated and considered healthy, they are still a fatty and high calorie fruit. Tonnage avocados are a great balance, as they have a rich texture but much lower fat content than most avocado varieties. While it\u2019s the one you\u2019re most likely to come across at the market, Hass avocados are among the fattiest varieties. Its relatives, like the Daily 11, are similarly oily and fatty.
