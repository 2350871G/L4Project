You can find the grapevine in some woods and along stone walls and roadsides.

You want to choose vigorous 1-year-old plants for planting.Plant in early spring, and erect a trellis to train the vines to grow up. Soak the roots in water for two hours before planting. Plant in a spot with full sun and about 6 feet apart. Dig a hole that is 2 inches deep and 12 inches wide. Fill the hole with about 4 inches of topsoil. Prune the leaves in the spring before the leaves grow long. Wind and insects will self fertilize the grapevines. Water the plants regularly, especially at their base."

Try to leave the curling tendrils if you can because it will make your wreath look better. For a large wreath, you will want about 10 vines, six to eight feet long. For smaller wreaths, use thinner and shorter vines."

If you wait too long and the vines become brittle, simply soak them in water for a couple of hours, and they should be easier to twist."
