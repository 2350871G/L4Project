      "description":"Set the temperature to 375 to 400 \u00b0F (191 to 204 \u00b0C). It will take some time (5 to 15 minutes, depending on your oven) for the oven to reach that temperature, so proceed to the next steps meanwhile. Prepare a shallow baking pan by placing a silicone baking sheet, parchment paper, or similar nonstick surface over it."

To test whether the nobby buns are baked enough, stick a toothpick into one of them and look if any dough sticks to it or if any of the dough is still obviously gooey. In both cases, the buns are not baked enough."
