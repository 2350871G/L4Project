          "description":"Deer won\u2019t eat foul-tasting or -smelling plants and will leave your yard alone. So, try planting a few holly or lilac shrubs around the perimeter of your yard. Or, if you have a garden, fill it with potent herbs and flowers like yarrow, thyme, rosemary, and lavender. With enough of these deer-deterring plants in place, the animals should avoid every plant in your garden or yard. Deer also don't like ornamental grasses, irises, foxgloves, or yucca. Strong-smelling plants, like sage, chives, lemon balm, and bee balm, are effective at deterring deer as well. Deer also avoid plants with thorns. Roses are an exception; although they have sharp thorns, deer still love to eat them."

          "headline":"Install electric fencing around your yard to prevent deer from entering.",
          "description":"An electrical fence tends to work well and should be enough to keep deer away from your property. Set up the fence so it's at least 4\u20136 feet (1.2\u20131.8 m) high. Once a deer receives a shock from the fence, it\u2019ll quickly give up the idea of entering your yard. If you notice that deer are hopping over the wire, install a second electric fence 3 feet (0.91 m) inside of the first. To save money, fence off sections of your yard that contain plants you care about, rather than fencing off the perimeter of your property."

          "description":"Although it\u2019s unsightly, installing a high fence is one of the most reliable methods to keep deer out. Drive 8 ft (2.4 m) high posts into the ground around the area you\u2019d like to protect, then use zip ties to fasten chicken wire or plastic mesh around the perimeter of the poles. Angle the fence out by about 45 degrees to prevent deer from attempting to leap over it. Deer can easily jump clear over anything lower than 4 ft (1.2 m) high, and a 6 ft (1.8 m) fence risks entangling the animal and injuring it."

Purchase 2 or 3 and alternate them so deer don\u2019t become accustomed to 1 of the scents. Follow the instructions printed on the packaging and apply as directed. Keep in mind that the spray will wear off after a rainstorm, and should be reapplied about 1-2 times per month even in dry weather. Not all commercial deer repellents are environmentally friendly. Read the label before you purchase a repellent if you're concerned about the environment. This is especially important if you'll be spraying the repellent on a vegetable or herb garden. Also consider the smell factor when purchasing a deer repellent. If a spray is too odorous, you\u2019re unlikely to want to sit in your garden or yard!"

Cover the perimeter of your yard with the spray 2\u20133 times a month to keep deer out. Or, if you\u2019re interested in protecting specific plants in a garden plot, spray plants that you don't want eaten by deer with a hot pepper spray. Make the spray by combining 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water with 3 tbsp (37 g) of crushed red pepper flakes. Simmer in a saucepan for 15 minutes, then mix in 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of liquid castile soap. Remove the liquid mixture from the heat and let it sit for 24 hours, then strain it into a plastic spray bottle."

You only need to reapply the soap to your yard about 1 time per month, or after a heavy rainstorm. To create the soap flakes, try grating off pieces of bar soap using a clean cheese grater. Or, use a kitchen knife to cut a bar of soap into \u20444 in \u00d7 \u20444 in (0.64 cm \u00d7 0.64 cm) cubes."

Spread a generous amount of hair around the perimeter of your yard if you\u2019re concerned that deer may invade. If you have a smaller garden plot or flowerbed, spread hair across the entire area. To obtain a bag of hair, visit a local barber or hairdresser. They should have plenty of leftover hair at the end of every business day, and will most likely give it to you free of charge."

Hanging socks full of hair will fill the area with a human scent and keep deer away. Since the hair will be contained within the socks, the makeshift repellent should work for a few weeks. Then, fill new socks with hair and hang them in the same locations. Use dirty, old socks that you don\u2019t mind throwing away once the hair has stopped deterring deer from entering your yard."

The sign of a predator should scare the deer off and keep them from returning. Allow the dog to re-mark the same territory every few days, or after it rains. Technically, you could borrow a friend's dog for this purpose (and to scare off deer in general). If you notice that deer come to your yard at a specific time, borrow a friend's dog for an hour or 2 when the deer will be coming by."

Allow your dog to roam the yard or garden space, since it won't do much good locked inside the house.
