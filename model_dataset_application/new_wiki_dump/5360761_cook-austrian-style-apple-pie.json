  "text":" Preparing the apples Wash and clean the apples, then cut them in halves. Remove the core and cut them into slices of about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) thickness. Sprinkle the apple halves with lemon juice. Add sugar and cinnamon. Let the apple halves rest for about an hour and a half so that they release their juice. Pour about 100 milliliters (3  fl oz) of apple juice into a saucepan with a little sugar. Heat and stir until it caramelizes. Use a teaspoon of butter to sprinkle the apple halves with.  Making the pie Heat the oven to 350\u00baF/180\u00baC.  Prepare the dough for the pie. Stretch it really well, rolling it out on a surface covered with enough flour that the dough does not stick. Brush the pie pan or dish with butter. Then dust it with flour. Add a first layer of dough. The flour helps prevent it from sticking to the pan or dish. Add the apples. Sprinkle them with the caramelized juice and wrap them with the second piece of dough, for the topping. Brush the pie with beaten egg for a glaze.  Baking the pie Place in the preheated oven. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until brownish on top. In about 30 minutes, the pie will be ready. Remove it from the oven using oven mitts. Dust generously with powdered sugar.  Cut it while still hot. Now the pie is ready for serving. Serve on individual plates. Serve with a little brown sugar for more taste. A little cream is also nice.",
