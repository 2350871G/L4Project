If the cotton balls are saturated in nail polish remover, remember to wring them out into a separate container with a secure lid. Throw out that container as a hazardous waste.

If it\u2019s a bottle of nail polish remover, make sure the cap is screwed on tightly enough so it doesn\u2019t leak out. Reduce your exposure to acetone fumes by wearing a special mask with an air filter in it. The mask must be NIOSH approved. One type of mask is the N95 which filters out some acrylic powders, dust, germs, and some chemical odors. However, it doesn\u2019t filter every chemical. Another type of mask to wear is a half-mask respirator. This will filter out acetone fumes, as well as all other harmful toxic odors."
