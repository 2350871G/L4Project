          "description":"The best way to clean a leafy green like rabe is to give it a cold water bath. Fill a large bowl with cool water. You can also use a clean sink if you prefer. Dump the rabe in, separating the leaves as you go so dirt can shake loose. Alternatively, you can wash the greens under cold, running water. However, submerging them is a safer bet for getting out all the dirt and grit."

Modern day produce is generally not as dirty as in the past, but you may still need to rinse it more than once if you got it from the farmer's market."
