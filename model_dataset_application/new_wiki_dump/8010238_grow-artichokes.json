In short, if you live in a climate that has consistent winter temperatures between 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) and 20 \u00b0F (\u22127 \u00b0C), plan to plant artichokes annually. If you live in a relatively warmer climate, you may be able to grow a perennial artichoke variety. If you live in the U.S., see the maps provided by the USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service to determine what zone you live in. If you live in Zone 8 or higher\u2014which corresponds with the temperatures cited above\u2014go with an annual plant varietal. These USDA maps also contain information on the temperatures used to assess an area\u2019s zone, which you can compare to temperatures in your area."

Among the green varietals, go with \u201cImperial Star\u201d artichokes for an annual plant and \u201cGreen Globe\u201d for a high-producing perennial. Among purple artichoke options, \u201cVioletta\u201d may prove especially hardy, and \u201cOpera\u201d will mature especially quickly."

Consider building raised beds to assist in drainage if you live in an area with heavy rainfall. Plan to prepare soil with at least 6 inches (15 cm) of compost tilled into the ground before planting."

Start your seeds in individual 4 in (10 cm) containers and leave them under fluorescent lights or in a heated greenhouse. In normal indoor temperatures, seeds will likely germinate in a week or so. Increase the size of planters as needed. To harden off the artichokes, begin exposing seedlings to temporary outdoor sessions 6 weeks before the anticipated last frost date in your area."

You actually want to expose the plants to a temperature below 45 \u00b0F (7 \u00b0C) to trigger flowering. They should be about as tall as your hand. Plant the seedlings so that the crown, or top, of the plant is just above the soil line. Cull weak seedlings. After 8-10 weeks, healthy artichoke seedlings will have stocky stems and two sets of leaves. Remove any that do not."

Plan to start growing your transplants indoors late in the winter or in early spring. Harvest will occur in late summer or early fall. Acquiring rooted shoots from a year-round greenhouse or online plant distributor is a great way to establish transplants quickly. If acquiring them yourself, use a serrated knife to begin cutting an offshoot under 10 inches (25 cm) tall that\u2019s growing from the base of the plant. Dig around the offshoot to ensure roots come with the offshoot as you remove it."
