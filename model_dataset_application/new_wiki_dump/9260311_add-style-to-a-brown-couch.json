Light colors such as cream or tan stand out against brown, and you can switch to more vibrant colors like red or blue as needed. Pillows and pillow covers come in such a wide variety that you'll always be able to customize your couch with them. For extra style points, mix in some patterned pillows."

You can also spread it across one of the couch cushions. Every blanket has its own color and texture combination, so they'll all provide a unique flair to your couch."

If you have a brown couch and a bunch of solid brown chairs, you'll end up with way too much brown. Move the chairs to another room. Substitute them with colorful furniture that complements the couch."

Ottomans, end tables, and bookcases are all customizable. Look for ones that are a light brown or white wood, or choose pieces you can paint bright colors. Another option is to fill the tables and shelving with colorful objects. Even a few red and blue books make a big difference. Brown is a neutral color, so almost any style or shade of decor can make it pop."

You can also pick ones with specific colors, such as blue, that promote a color theme. Set the chairs near your couch and you'll quickly notice they make the couch look less drab. You can use a dark-colored chair. For example, a wood-framed chair looks pleasant next to the couch, but needs to be accentuated with colorful or patterned cushioning. If you do choose to have all dark colored furniture, though, you may want to paint the walls a lighter color, or use a light rug to anchor and balance the room."

There are many different varieties of indoor plants, so you can find ones that look pleasant in your room. Also, don't underestimate how a vase full of fresh flowers changes a room. Some indoor plants you can get are pothos, aloe, jade plants, and peace lilies, all of which require little maintenance. Make sure you research a plant variety before buying it. Some are toxic to children and pets. You can also opt for faux plants to avoid these dangers, or to accommodate someone who has plant allergies."

White ones always balance out the coloring, but you may also get other colors such as blue. For example, set the couch near the window and hang thin, white curtains. The white contrasts the brown while also letting light into the room. More colorful curtains work well in themed rooms. Blue curtains, for example, can match blue pillows. If you don't want curtains, opt for lighter colored blinds or shades. You can also hang a light colored valance to compliment your sofa."
