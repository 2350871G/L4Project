Protecting Pure Aluminium Objects by Anodising Use water to clean the aluminium object you want to protect. Scrub it completely clean of all marks using hot soapy water. The aluminium object cannot have any marks on it, even a fingerprint, as any marks will be permanently anodized  onto the metal. Clean the object in a cup of caustic soda solution. Mix a solution of 5 grams (0.18 oz) of caustic soda to 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Allow the object to soak in the caustic soda for 2-4 minutes until metal looks milky. Construct your anodising tank. Get a small rectangular plastic container and put it inside a larger plastic tub. This will help protect your work surface from any spills. Hang two lead cathodes over the short edges of the inner tank. You can use pieces of lead flashing as cathodes (objects through which a negative current runs). The cathodes need to have a surface area at least twice the size of the aluminium objects that you want to anodise. Lead flashing is commonly used to protect roofs and you can buy it online or at a hardware store. Hang the lead cathodes over the edges of the tank using anodising jigs (hooks for the edges of the tank). These can be bought at a hardware store or online or you can make them out of titanium wire. Connect the lead cathodes to a power supply. If possible, you should use a variable-voltage desktop power supply. Use a current of at least 0.145 milliamps per square inch (6.45 square cm) of the aluminium object\u2019s surface area. If you don\u2019t have a variable-voltage power supply, use a fixed-voltage power supply with a voltage appropriate to the object being anodised. Connect the power supply\u2019s positive lead to an ammeter. Ammeters check and control voltage and you can buy them online or from a hardware store. Prepare an electrolyte solution. Electrolyte is the liquid which will sit in the anodising tank and which will cover the object being protected. The amount you need depends on the size of your tank and the size of the object you want to protect. Use a solution of car battery acid diluted with water in a 1-1 ratio. Place the water in the inner plastic tank and slowly pour the acid into the water. The electrolyte may heat up when the acid and water mix, so you should leave the electrolyte to cool for at least 18 hours. Hang the aluminium object in the electrolyte on a titanium hook. An aluminium wire hook may corrode during the anodising process. Drive the hook through a block of wood large enough to sit on top of the tank. Connect the power supply leads to the anode and cathode. Connect the power supply\u2019s negative lead and the ammeter\u2019s negative lead to the lead cathodes. Connect the ammeter\u2019s positive lead to the aluminium object (the anode). Leave the aluminium object in the electrolyte for an hour. Make sure that the aluminium object does not touch the cathodes as this may short them out. Turn on the current. Watch for bubbles rising from the aluminium object. This shows that the anodising process is happening properly. Wash the aluminium object in water. Take the object out of the electrolyte and place it in a tub of ionized  water overnight so that the acid can wash off. Ionized  water can be created by running tap water through a water ioniser (available online).",
