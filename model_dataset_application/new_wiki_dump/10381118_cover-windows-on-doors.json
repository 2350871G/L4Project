          "description":"The slotted framework of the shutters will allow you to filter in as much or as little light into a room as you want. These work great on simple French doors with large, clear glass panes, and can give the room a modern or tropical vibe. For a modern look, get white shutters that will match the molding or framework within the room. This will tie the overall design of the room together. Wooden shutters that are simply polished and unpainted will give a rustic or farmhouse feel to any French door. Pick shutters that are a bold color that will contrast nicely with the rest of the room. If you have pops of green within the beach-themed room, maybe get the shutters in a similar shade."

          "headline":"Hang lightweight or sheer curtains to allow sunlight to filter through.",
          "description":"Position a long curtain rod over the French doors, and drape curtains that float just above the floor. This will modernize and create some privacy between two living spaces. Stick to lightweight or sheer fabrics that will allow sunlight to filter through. Thick, dark panels can give the illusion that a room is more cluttered or smaller than it really is. Consider creating a double layer of curtains. The inner rod will support sheer curtains for when you want the light to filter through, and the outer rod will support curtains that will block out the light entirely. If you do opt for thicker curtains, make sure to note the packaged weight of the panels. Curtain rod manufacturers will typically have a recommended or a maximum curtain weight for each rod. Putting a heavy curtain on a thin rod may bend or even break the rod."

          "headline":"Apply window film to the panels to make the glass opaque.",
          "description":"Window film is a very common window treatment for French doors as it offers a clean, modernized look, and allows sunlight to filter through. Just keep in mind that the film has to be measured, cut, and carefully applied to each individual glass pane on the French doors. This may be a project you need to tackle over a few days, but once it is completed, you will be happy with the results. To apply the window film you are going to have to treat it with a solution of water and film aid concentrate. Follow the manufacturing instructions on how to properly adhere the window film you picked out to avoid getting air bubbles or creases in the film."

          "description":"These are good if you want to switch between having complete privacy or complete visibility between two rooms. Sometimes curtains can get in the way or clutter a room. Due to the compact nature of the roller-shades, they are good to use on French doors that are opened and closed multiple times throughout the day. Roller shades are often available to purchase at local hardware or window stores, and come in a variety of neutral and bold colors. With an accented, colored stripe down the length of the fabric, Roman shades are great to use if you want a slight pop of color on a relatively neutral window treatment. These are a form of roller-shades that have more of a pleated-look, and will add texture to the surrounding decor."

These treatments often are made of pleated paper or a sturdy, pleated fabric. The paper version usually only comes in neutral tones like white or off-white, which means it will allow light to filter through. These inexpensive shades can often be purchased in the household goods section of department stores, or in the window section of hardware stores. Fabric treatments will most likely have to be custom made through a window or shade manufacturer, and can be costly if your window is large.

The translucency of the contact paper will allow light to shine through and give a stained glass effect, but will still be tinted enough to give the illusion of a window covering. This method is great if you have one window to cover, or if you are looking for a fun craft to do with children. If you don\u2019t want a stained glass look, but more of a collage of colors, cut the tissue paper into squares, circles, rectangles, or even flowers. Then layer the shapes onto the contact paper. This will give your window a more freeform and almost watercolor effect. This technique looks especially good when you have a specific color palette of tissue paper, or have varying shapes to layer with. If there are multiple glass panes within the fan-window, the stained glass or collage treatment will have to be done for each pane separately."

Get window clings that will match the surrounding decor. Maybe you want a geometric pattern to match the doormat on the front porch, or maybe you decorated the outside of the door to your classroom and want fun window clings that are numbers and letters to match.
