There are different types of sand blasters, so you will make sure that you select one suited to removing graffiti. Beware, sand blasters can remove underlying paint as well, so you will usually only want to use a sandblaster on a plain surface. Sand blasters can be used to clean a wide variety of surfaces including concrete, metal, brick, masonry, and wood. Sand blasters can be erosive! Be careful on old stone, brick, and wood, as a sandblaster can speed the deterioration of porous surfaces. Sand blasters can remove paint, rust, and grease as well."
