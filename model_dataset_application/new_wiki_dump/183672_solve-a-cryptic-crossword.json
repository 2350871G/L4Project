Definitions are almost always located near the beginning or end of the sentence. The clue\u2019s definition is very important because it tells you the literal meaning of the answer you are looking for. Consider the following clue: \u201cQuoted from edict wrongly.\u201d \u201cQuoted from\u201d is the definition because it comes at the beginning of the sentence and hints at the clue's answer. The definition is often a synonym of the clue's answer, which is \u201ccited\u201d in this case. When the definition is less obvious, identify the two possibilities then eliminate one by considering the rest of the clue. In \u201cDesire for Japanese money,\u201d the definition could be \u201cdesire\u201d or \u201cJapanese money.\u201d \"Japanese money\u201d is the definition and a synonym of \u201cYen,\u201d which is the answer to this particular clue.

These words, which indicate direction, often signify that the answer to your clue will involve spelling a word backward, or in reverse. Consider the following clue: \u201cRestrain New York team going west.\u201d Following your established procedure, you\u2019ll first identify the definition (\u201crestrain\u201d), the wordplay (\u201cNew York team), and the indicator (\u201cgoing west\u201d). Using your powers of synonym identification, you\u2019ll cleverly deduce that the \u201cMets\u201d are a New York team and that \u201cMets\u201d spelled backward gives you \u201cstem.\u201d \u201cStem\u201d is the answer because it is also a synonym of \u201crestrain\u201d (your definition).",
