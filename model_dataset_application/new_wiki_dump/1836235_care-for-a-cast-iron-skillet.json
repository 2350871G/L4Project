Simply wipe out the food scraps with a sponge and then rinse the skillet with hot water. You can use a touch of regular dish soap to help dislodge sticky food, but don't use too much. Never use bleach or any kind of harsh cleanser. Never put your cast iron skillet in the dishwasher. The detergent will corrode the iron."

It's easier on the iron than a scrub brush would be, and less likely to remove the nonstick seasoning. You can also burn off caked food. Turn up the oven to 500 \u00b0F (260 \u00b0C) and put the skillet inside for an hour or so. The food will turn to ash, and you'll be able to brush it off and rinse the skillet. However, if you use this method you'll need to re-season the skillet, since that will get burned off as well."

If you're stacking it with other pans, you might want to line the skillet with a paper towel to make sure that no moisture gets trapped between them and protect the seasoning from getting scratched off. Seasoning a New Skillet Preheat the oven to 350 \u00baF. To season a brand new cast iron skillet, you rub it with oil and bake the oil into the surface of the cast iron. This builds up a nonstick coating, called the \"seasoning,\" that keeps the skillet from rusting and creates the perfect surface for cooking everything from scrambled eggs to pancakes to cobblers.

Make sure to dry the skillet well, so that it doesn't create steam when you put it in the oven. Coat the skillet with fat. You can use lard, vegetable shortening, or olive oil. Use a paper towel to rub the fat into the skillet all over. The fat will bake into the skillet and fuse with the iron to become a layer of seasoning. You won't be able to taste or smell it once the process is complete. Try not to miss any spots when you're covering the skillet with fat. If you miss a spot, it won't get a coating of seasoning, and will be more prone to rusting. Put the skillet in the oven. Bake the skillet for 2 hours to make sure the seasoning gets fully formed. After 2 hours, remove it from the oven and set it on a heat safe surface to cool. Repeat the process. Spread another coating of fat onto the skillet and bake it for another 2 hours, then let it cool.

After this initial seasoning, the oil you use when you cook food will keep the skillet in good shape. Every time you cook a meal, the nonstick surface will improve. Dealing With Rust Soak the skillet in a vinegar solution. This will eliminate the rust, and it works no matter whether you have a few spots or the entire skillet has gotten rusty. Get a big pot large enough to hold the skillet. Fill it with a solution of half white vinegar, half water. Place the skillet in the pot and make sure it's completely submerged.

Don't soak the skillet for more than 4 hours, or the iron will start to degrade. You just want to soak it long enough to take off the rust. Rinse and dry the skillet. Rinse off all of the vinegar, then use a dish towel to completely dry the skillet. Coat it with fat. Just like you would for a brand new skillet, use a paper towel to rub lard, olive oil or vegetable oil all over the skillet. This will become the skillet's new seasoning. Bake the skillet for 2 hours. Put it in an oven preheated to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). After 2 hours, remove the skillet and let it cool completely. Repeat the process. Coat it in another layer of oil, bake for 2 hours, and allow it to cool again. The once-rusty skillet should now have a protective layer of seasoning.",
