Lightly toast your bread so it\u2019s golden brown and crunchy. Place bacon, tomato, and lettuce on top one of the bread slices and put mayo on the top slice of your sandwich to finish your BLT.

Heat the sandwich over medium-low heat and flip it over when one side gets crispy. Compress the sandwich with another skillet while it\u2019s cooking to flatten it and make it easier to eat.

Look for different types of bread, like sourdough, pumpernickel, or rye, to see how they affect the overall flavor of your sandwich. If you want to make a large sub sandwich, cut a baguette horizontally down the middle to use as the top and bottom pieces. Try using buns or rolls instead of sliced bread if you want to make smaller sandwiches. Look for pitas or tortillas if you\u2019d rather have a wrap."

You can put the condiments on both slices of bread or just one depending on how much you want to use. Experiment with different condiments to find new sandwich flavors.

For example, you may put hot sauce directly on meat to make it spicier.Tip: Condiments can make your bread a little soggy if you let them sit for too long before eating your sandwich.
