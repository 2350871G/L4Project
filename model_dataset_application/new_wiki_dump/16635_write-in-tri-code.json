For the purpose of providing a guided example, the message \"Welcome to the jungle\" will be translated into Tri Code.

In the guided example, \"Wel\" are the first three letters, therefore, the first segment is \"Lew.\" Generally, each segment is separated by a space. This further distances same-word letters from each other, making it more difficult for others to see the pattern of your Tri Code cipher. In the beginning, it's likely you'll need to write down your translated message so you don't forget it. When Tri Code is more familiar, you may be able to do this translation in your head."

For example, the 'e' at the end of \"welcome\" will combine with the next two letters of the following word, \"to\" to create the segment \"eto.\" This is then written in reverse to get the Tri Code \"ote.\" At this point, you should have three segments translated into Tri Code, giving you the partially translated message, \"Lew moc ote.\""

You can choose to shift either to the left or right as many positions as you desire. If you reach the beginning of the alphabet, continue shifting from the end and vice versa. Therefore, with left shift three A becomes Y, and with right shift three Z becomes B. Basic shift ciphers should only shift letters in a single direction. When using the Caesar Cipher, you should never shift both left and right at the same time.
