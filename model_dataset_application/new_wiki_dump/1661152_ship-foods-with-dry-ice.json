A rupture can be caused by pressure pushed down on a package during shipments. Therefore, the material you use should allow the release of some pressure. You can use good quality fiberboard, also known as corrugated cardboard, which you can purchase online or at a local hardware store. You can also use plastic or wooden boxes to ship with dry ice. Do not use steel drums or jerrycans to ship dry ice."

If you're using a Styrofoam cooler, do not seal it completely as this can prevent the package from releasing pressure. Packs of dry ice should be on the bottom, followed by food items.
