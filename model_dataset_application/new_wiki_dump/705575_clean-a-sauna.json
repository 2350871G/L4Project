Dip your hand brush into a solution of warm water and a mild detergent and \nUse towels in the sauna to prevent stains. You don\u2019t necessarily want to wear one during the steam, but at least lay one down on the bench where you will be sitting. This will prevent too much sweat, dirt, and dead skin from getting into the wood, which is what causes stains. If stains are particularly difficult to get out, use a light sandpaper to sand down that part of the wood."
