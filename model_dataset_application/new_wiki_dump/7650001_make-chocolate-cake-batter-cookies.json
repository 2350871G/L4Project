The batter should be slightly thick and doughy, and should also be a dark chocolate brown.

Pour about about 4 tablespoons of sprinkles in a bowl and roll the ball in it, if desired. Continue to make cookie balls until dough is used up. You may add more sprinkles if you are all out and need to roll the cookie balls more."
