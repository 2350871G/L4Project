It\u2019s a great method to get the best fit for any foot type and any kind of running shoe. Lace your shoes up with whatever technique you\u2019d like. The heel lock works well with the classic criss-cross technique, but can also be used with any of the other methods listed below. See what type works best for you, then add in the heel lock for extra stability. Loop the lace through the top eyelet on the both sides of the shoe. From a seated position, turn your foot to the outside to see the uppermost eyelet on the shoe, near your anklebone. Take the lace on that side of the foot and pull the tip through that eyelet. The tip should be pointing towards your foot, creating a big loop. Repeat on the inside of your foot. Pull the lace through until a 2 in (5.1 cm) long loop remains. On the outside side of your shoe, pull the tip of the lace farther through until it makes a smaller loop, about 2 in (5.1 cm) long. Repeat this on the inside of your foot. The loops should be small enough to stick out a bit without laying flat against your shoe. Cross the laces and insert them in the opposite loop. Take the lace on the outside of your foot and cross it over the shoe. Place the tip of the lace into the loop, but don\u2019t pull it through yet. Do the same with the lace on the inside of your foot. The middle of the laces should be crossed over the tongue of your shoe. Pull the laces down hard and tie. Take the ends of both laces and pull hard to the side to cinch them. Pull down with the laces, not up, as that would cause the loop to hang down. Pulling down will pull the loop tight against your shoe so you can get the snuggest fit. Tie and repeat with the other shoe. Now that your heel lock is in place, tie a normal double-knot. Repeat the process on the other shoe for a comfortable, supportive fit. Loosening the Laces for a Wide Foot Choose this technique to give wide feet a bit more room. With this method, you\u2019ll be skipping over some eyelets on the shoe. This loosens the overall fit and gives your feet more space to spread out. Draw the lace straight across the bottom 2 eyelets. Remove the lace from the shoe and insert both tips into the lowest eyelets so that they\u2019re facing the tongue of the shoe. Pull both laces all the way through. Cross the laces to the next eyelets. Cross one lace over the other and draw them across to the next eyelets. Pull them through from the inside out, so that the tips are facing away from the shoe. Lace through every other eyelet until you get to the top of the shoe. Cross the laces again and skip over the next eyelet on either side. Pull the laces through the following eyelets. Cross them again and repeat until you get to the top of the shoe. Repeat the method on the other shoe. Tightening Up for a Narrow Foot Try this technique if you want your shoes to fit more snugly. If your feet are narrow or your shoes just a bit too wide, try this tightening method. It\u2019s a slight modification on the typical criss-cross method, which will help your shoes fit more closely against your feet. Draw the laces straight across the bottom 2 eyelets. Remove the lace completely. Insert the laces into the bottom two eyelets so that the tips are pointing towards the shoe, then pull the laces taut. Pull each lace straight up to the next eyelet. Instead of crossing the laces as you normally would, draw each lace up vertically to the next eyelet. Pull them through from the inside out, so that the tips are pointing outwards. Cross the laces over each other to the opposite eyelets. Place one lace over the other like you would if you were lacing your shoes normally. Pull each one through the next eyelet on the other side. Cross again, skipping over the next eyelet on each side. This time, cross the laces but leave the next eyelet empty on either side. Pull the laces up to the following eyelet on either side and pull them through. Finish lacing the shoe normally. Continue crossing the laces and pulling them through each eyelet, then tie them normally at the top. When you\u2019re finished, only one pair of eyelets should be empty. Repeat the process on the other shoe. Lacing to Loosen the Top of the Shoe Use this method if your shoe is too tight across the top. This technique will greatly loosen the top and sides of your shoes. It\u2019s a great choice if your shoe is feeling a little tight, or if your feet are swollen and need more room. Lace the bottom two eyelets above your big toe. Instead of lacing across the bottom of the shoe, pull one side of the lace down through the eyelet above your big toe. Pull it 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) through. Then, insert the other tip of the lace through the next eyelet up on the same side. Pull it tight. Both laces should be hanging out of the inside part of your shoe. Pull the bottom lace straight across to the parallel eyelet. Insert the lace from the outside in, so that, as you\u2019re pulling it through, the tip should be going towards the tongue of the shoe. Pull it until the lace is taut going across. Don\u2019t move the upper lace just yet. It should still be hanging on the inside of the shoe. Pull the lace through the 3rd eyelet on the same side of the shoe. With the same lace, skip over the next eyelet. Insert it into the third eyelet on the same side of the shoe. Slide the lace through from the inside out, so that you\u2019re pulling it away from the shoe. Draw the other lace across to its parallel eyelet. Return to the lace on the inside of your shoe. Pull it across the tongue to the parallel eyelet, then insert it from the outside in, so that the tip is facing towards the shoe. Pull the lace all the way through. Pull it through the eyelet just above the first lace, on the same side of the shoe. Draw the lace straight up the shoe, skipping over the next eyelet and inserting it into the 4th eyelet. Pull it through to the outside. Both laces should now be hanging off the outside of the shoe. Continue this pattern until you get to the top of the shoe. Pull the bottom lace through the parallel eyelet, then draw it straight up, skipping one eyelet and pulling it through the next. Do the same with the other lace. Repeat until you get to the top of the shoe, then tie normally. Repeat the process on your other foot.",
