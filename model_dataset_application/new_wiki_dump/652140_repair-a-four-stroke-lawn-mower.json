If you do, skip to step five. If you felt little or no resistance and heard an asthmatic-sounding puff noise, you have bad compression. If you felt and heard nothing, ensure that the starter cord system is working. If it is, you may have a thrown rod and should replace the mower."

      "headline":"Troubleshoot bad compression, if you had it.",
      "description":"Bad compression could be caused by either a bent/broken valve, or a blown head gasket. Remove the eight large bolts from the front of the engine (and anything in the way) and remove the head. Check the head gasket for any missing chunks. If you found missing chunks, remove what is left and obtain a replacement from a small engine shop. Then use steel wool to remove any stuck on pieces of gasket, place the new one on, replace everything and try to start it. If the gasket was intact, inspect the valves and ensure that one isn't bent or not fully closing. If it is bent, gently pry it straight with a slotted screwdriver and try to get it to start. If a valve was straight but not closing, you need to remove the valve and, depending on severity, either use a bench grinder to shorten the back end, or replace the valve entirely. Both of these are difficult and complex procedures and you may prefer to replace the mower unless you have a lots of time, patience, and experience."
