          "headline":"Add a small amount of water to whiskey to enjoy a softer drink.",
          "description":"Although this is a matter of some debate, many people choose to pour a little bit of water into their single malt whiskey to dilute it. This makes the drink less sharp and allows them to experience the whiskey\u2019s more subtle flavors. Add a few drops of water to your drink to see if you like it more. Most people who support adding water to whiskey would encourage you to add your water in small increments and to taste; there\u2019s no set amount of water that you should add to your drink. Although some people insist you should only add distilled water to whiskey, others will tell you that tap water works perfectly fine."

          "headline":"Have whiskey on the rocks for a colder, slightly diluted drink.",
          "description":"Drinking your whiskey over ice will give you a more chilled and refreshing drink for warmer climates and will slightly numb your palate, making the whiskey a bit more palatable for inexperienced drinkers. The slight dilution of the whiskey caused by the melting ice will also allow you to taste different flavors and nuances in the drink than if you drink it neat. Although connoisseurs of whiskey debate over whether adding ice to the drink is good or bad, some whiskeys, such as high-proof bourbon, are generally considered to be improved by the addition of ice. If you add ice to your whiskey, aim to only use large ice cubes, as these will take longer to melt and will do a better job of keeping your drink cool."

        {
          "headline":"Drink whiskey neat to appreciate the full sensation of its flavor.",
          "description":"Drink the whiskey in small sips instead of larger gulps; the high alcohol content may feel overwhelming at first. Once you get used to this effect, however, you\u2019ll be able to appreciate the drink\u2019s flavor and detect the various nuances in your particular whiskey. These nuances in the flavor may include spicy notes, smokiness, woodiness, or hints of other flavors like vanilla and caramel."

          "description":"Whiskey tastes the best when served at temperatures around 60 to 65 \u00b0F (16 to 18 \u00b0C). Although you or someone you\u2019re serving may choose to add water or ice to the whiskey, thereby changing its temperature, your whiskey should always start out at room temperature before being served. If your whiskey was previously kept in a cool or chilled environment, you can simply leave it out on a kitchen counter or bar until it achieves this optimal temperature."

        {
          "headline":"Nose the whiskey with your mouth open to detect its different flavors.",
          "description":"Nosing whiskey is the act smelling your whiskey while it\u2019s in the glass to appreciate its flavor and aroma before drinking it. In contrast to sniffing wine, you should smell the whiskey in small, sharp sniffs and keep your mouth open as you sniff it to avoid overwhelming and \u201cburning\u201d your nose. If sniffing the whiskey starts to become unpleasant, take a break and sniff the back of your hand; this will \u201creset\u201d your nose and allow you to comfortably smell the whiskey again. The best glass to use for drinking whiskey is a tulip-shaped glass; its unique shape allows you to experience the full aroma of the whiskey."

          "headline":"Store your whiskey at a constant temperature and out of direct sunlight.",
          "description":"Changes in light exposure and in temperature cause chemical reactions in your whiskey that can negatively impact its flavor profile. To avoid these, keep whiskey in a part of your house that remains at a constant temperature and that isn\u2019t exposed to direct sunlight, such as your cellar, basement, or an insulated attic. If an opened whiskey bottle is still \u2154 full, you can expect it to remain good to drink for up to a year, if you store it at a constant temperature and away from sunlight. Be sure the bottle is tightly sealed to prevent more air from entering the bottle and interacting with the whiskey. Once a bottle of whiskey becomes more than 75% air, the whiskey will only be good for about another month."

Some Rob Roy recipes call for specifically orange bitters, while some don\u2019t use any bitters at all.
