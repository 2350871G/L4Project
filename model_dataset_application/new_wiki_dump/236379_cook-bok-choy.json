To prepare the bok choy:\nCut off the very end of the stem that\u2019s keeping the leaves together. Separate the bok choy, but leave the center leaf bulb intact. Wash the leaves and stems by running them under cold water. Make sure you rub the bottom of the stem well to remove dirt from around where the roots were. Pat dry with a clean towel. If you aren't using baby bok choy, cut the leaves off the stems, keeping the two pieces separate. Cut the leaves and stems into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. Baby bok choy is already bite-sized and has more tender stems, so it doesn\u2019t have to be cut up."
