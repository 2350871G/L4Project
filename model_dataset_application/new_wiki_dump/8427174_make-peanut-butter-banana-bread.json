Next, grease a 9-inch by 5-inch (23-cm by 13-cm) loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it\u2019s reached the right temperature. It will likely make a beeping sound and/or flash an indicator light. You can grease the pan with butter or shortening if you prefer."

Use an electric mixer to blend the ingredients together on medium-high speed until the mixture is smooth. You can substitute chunky peanut butter for the smooth if you prefer. It will alter the texture of the bread, though, because there will be chunks of nuts in it. If you prefer, you can mix the batter in a stand mixer. You can also mix the batter by hand, but it will require more time and effort."

For the best-tasting bread, the bananas should be yellow with an even amount of brown freckles scattered across the peel. If your bananas aren\u2019t ripe yet, place the unpeeled fruit on a cookie sheet and bake in the oven at 250 degrees (121 degrees Celsius) for 15 to 20 minutes or until they are soft."
