      "description":"The panda's eyes should be large, as this is what gives the drawing both its cute effect and the emo appearance. Draw two big circles with a smaller one in between. Make the smaller circle a bright color or simply leave it white. For the pupils, draw two more smaller circles near the center. Leave the inside of this circle white."
