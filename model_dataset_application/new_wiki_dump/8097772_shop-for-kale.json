To ensure that you are getting the freshest kale possible, make sure that the kale you are purchasing has been refrigerated or that it has just been picked. Look for kale in the refrigerated section of your grocery store. Don\u2019t buy kale that is not refrigerated. Ask farmers when the kale was picked and if it has been refrigerated. If it has been more than a few hours unrefrigerated, then you might want to pass on that kale. However, if it has been kept refrigerated, then it should be fine."

For this reason, it is best to buy organic kale. This will help to ensure that the kale you are eating is as safe as possible. Check the packaging for the words \u201ccertified organic\u201d to determine if the kale you are buying is organic. If your store\u2019s produce section has an organic section, then look for loose leaf kale in this area. If you are shopping at a farmers\u2019 market, you can check around to see if any of the farmers are certified organic. However, keep in mind that most small farms are not certified organic, even though they may use organic practices.
