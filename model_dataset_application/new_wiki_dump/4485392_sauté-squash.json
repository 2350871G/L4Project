Different types of winter squashes have different textures that would make them harder or easier to saut\u00e9.

Select a range of spices to use before you begin cooking your squash. A summer squash would go well with cloves, curry powder, marjoram, nutmeg, rosemary, or sage.

Butter will give your squash a sweeter taste. For a sweeter squash, use butter. However, if you want a sweeter taste without as much calories or cholesterol, you can use half butter and half olive oil. If you would rather have a more savory taste, olive oil may be a better option."

Before washing the vegetable, make sure to wash your hands first. Wash them for about 20 seconds using soap and water. Wash your squash under running water. Rub any dirt or debris off of the squash as you wash it. Do not use any soap to wash your squash. You simply  need to wash it using water."

Thinner, smaller cubes may cook faster than larger, thicker ones. If you're working with winter squash, peel your squash first using a vegetable peeler. It's hard to work with un-peeled squash. You also may want to microwave the squash for 3 minute before cutting it into cubes. Winter squash is tougher, and this can make it easier to cut."

You want the squash to sizzle slightly when it makes contact with the butter and oil. However, if you're cooking squash with bacon, add the bacon first. Bacon should start on a cold pan without any olive or butter. If the bacon produces enough grease, you may not have to add butter or olive oil when you add your squash."
