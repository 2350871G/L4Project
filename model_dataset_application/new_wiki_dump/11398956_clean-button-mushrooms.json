As you work, set aside a clean bowl or pan so you can separate the clean mushrooms from the dirty ones. If you don\u2019t want to use a paper towel, try using a pastry brush or your fingertips instead. Since they can absorb moisture easily, you don\u2019t want your raw mushrooms to be soggy when you\u2019re using them as a salad topper. Because of this, it\u2019s better to wipe off your mushrooms instead of rinsing them."

Next, rub your fingers in short, smooth motions along the cap and stem to get rid of any obvious dirt and other specks. Once you\u2019ve finished rinsing and scrubbing your mushrooms, set them aside on a clean plate. You might see small, thin pieces of mushroom skin fall off at this time.

As you hold the bowl over the sink, turn on the faucet so the mushrooms can be doused with cool water. Move the container of mushrooms in a circular motion so that all of the mushrooms get evenly rinsed. Since cooked mushrooms will be exposed to other ingredients, it doesn\u2019t matter as much if they\u2019re a little damp going into the cooking process.
