  "text":" Preparing the Chicken Using a meat pounder or sharp knife, pound or cut the chicken into 1/4\" thick cutlets. Chicken piccata should be thin, as you need to brown the outsides while allowing the inside to quickly cook as well. Coat the chicken with salt and pepper. Use as much as you desire, making sure the entire pieces have at least a light dusting. Make sure both sides are seasoned. Dredge the chicken in flour, coating completely. Dredging means coating it, and it should be a nice, even coating of flour. This flour will cook to form a thin, breaded coating around your chicken. In a thick-bottomed pan on medium, heat up 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil. You could use all of one or the other, but this mixture actually has a purpose -- the two work together to keep the temperature of the oil correct while helping each other coat the chicken and, eventually, pasta. Furthermore, the richness of butter is cut by the unique, fresh taste of the olive oil, adding a new depth of flavor. Cook the chicken on both sides for 3-4 minutes.

When they are golden brown, remove from skillet and cover the chicken with tin foil. Do not throw all the pan juices out --they are essential for the piccata sauce! Preparing the Sauce and Serving Keeping the pot on, deglaze the pan with a cup of white wine or lemon broth. Deglazing is when cool liquid hits a hot pan, which loosens up all the flavorful burned bits on the pan's bottom to start a simple pan sauce or gravy. After the wine hits the pan, use a whisk or spatula to scrape up all the bits on the bottom of the pan, mixing them in. Note, however, that you do not have to use white wine if you don't desire:\nYou can also use 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice along with 2/3's cup chicken broth. If not used above, add the juice of one whole lemon and 1/3 cup chicken broth to the hot wine. The lemon is the essential flavor in this dish, and you need to add it at some point. You can either add it to the wine as a subtle flavor, or use it to deglaze the pan along with some chicken broth for a more intense kick. Add 2-3 tablespoons of fresh capers to the mixture and stir. Let everything cook on medium-low for a few minutes, letting the flavors meld. Now is the time to add salt and pepper as well, seasoning and tasting regularly to ensure it is coming out well. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and whisk together. Whisk it in so that it is all melted before moving on -- it shouldn't take long. Add the chicken back to the hot pan and cook together for 1-2 minutes.

Top with some shaved Parmesan or Romano and you have an Italian dish worth sharing. Variations Take your chicken breasts and dip them in milk ahead of time for a thicker breading.
