          "description":"Wedding photos are heirlooms the family will treasure for years. To produce high quality work, you should use high quality equipment. Start with mid-range products--you can always upgrade later. Talk to retailers and other photographers to see what they recommend. You\u2019ll need a tripod and a monopod, camera bags, lenses, 4 GB memory cards, a flash, and a camera. Rent your gear before you purchase. This will give you a trial period to see if it works for you."

          "description":"You need to know your photography equipment in and out. That way, you\u2019ll be able to focus on getting the perfect shot when the wedding day arrives. Go through your camera\u2019s owner\u2019s manual, take photos in tons of different conditions, and consider taking a photography class or workshop. Make sure you know how to handle your equipment in different lighting conditions and when the subject is moving quickly."

Consider taking classes at your university, local community college, or online. Photography classes can help you get a feel for technique and equipment fundamentals. If you are in college, consider majoring or minoring in photography."

          "description":"Every photographer has their own style. This style isn\u2019t fixed. Rather, it\u2019s constantly evolving as the photographer grows. To develop your own style, look to your favorite photographers for inspiration. See what elements you like, and try to bring them to life in your own work. There are two kinds of wedding photography: traditional, which involves classic, posed photos, and photojournalistic, which involves more candid photos. Your own style might lean towards one, or blend the two."

          "headline":"Take risks.",
          "description":"In order to grow creatively and develop your own photography style, you\u2019ll need to take risks. Try different angles and color schemes, and test different techniques. Just remember that the wedding is not the place for radical experimentation. While you can--and should--experiment with some shots at the wedding, avoid turning the entire shoot into a creative experiment."

It\u2019s a good idea to become proficient in photo editing softwares like Photoshop and Lightroom by watching online tutorials or attending workshops, and practicing on your own, of course. Consider your personal photography style when editing your photos. Your finished photos should reflect your style."

Working as an assistant to an established wedding photographer is a great way to get into the industry."

On your website, clients can learn more about your business while browsing through your work. Your online portfolio is a digital representation of your business, so make sure it looks professional. Your website should have a consistent style and easy-to-navigate format. One way to build your portfolio is to offer to work for free. You can help out a professional wedding photographer, or offer to shoot a friend's wedding free of charge. You\u2019ll gain valuable experience while getting shots for your portfolio."

Organizations like Wedding and Portrait Photographers International (WPPI) offer strategies, tips, and equipment reviews for professional wedding photographers. Try to find a photography group in your area. If you can\u2019t find one, consider starting your own."

Tell them about your style principles, and encourage them to look through your portfolio again. Maybe your clients want a more formal style, and yours is more candid. You can either refer the clients to a different photographer, or adjust your own style a bit for the shoot.
