This allows the cells of the flesh to fill with moisture, so that the smoking process doesn't leech out all the moisture. Wet cured smoked salmon is moist and flavorful."

Dry cured and smoked salmon tends to be drier and silkier than wet cured salmon. Dry cured salmon is typically made in smaller batches and tends to be the more expensive of the cured smoked salmon."
