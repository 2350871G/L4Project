It will look like a small, rounded cap. Turn it as far as possible to activate the radiator. This smaller valve controls the flow of water in traditional steam radiators. Turning the dial clockwise shuts it off. There is no in-between setting. Modern electrical radiators often have control panels instead of dials. Press the \u201con\u201d button to start the radiator, then use the panel to adjust the heat setting."

Grip the metal valve with the pliers, then turn it counterclockwise to activate the radiator. Replace the cap after turning the radiator on. Some lockshield caps are held in place with a screw. If you see a screw on the top of the cap, turn the screw counterclockwise to loosen it and remove the cap."

It\u2019s like a dial on any other type of heater. Turn the valve counterclockwise to increase the heat and clockwise to reduce it. The thermostatic valve controls the amount of heat escaping the radiator. Setting it at 0 prevents heat from escaping, but it doesn\u2019t turn off the water or electrical flow. Old radiators may not have a thermostatic valve. You will see a vent valve, sometimes with an adjustable component. These radiators aren\u2019t designed for heat control, so consider having a professional install a thermostatic valve."

If you are away from home during a period of freezing weather, turn on the frost setting to protect the radiator from damage. The frost setting keeps the radiator at a low heat level so the liquids inside of it can\u2019t freeze. The radiator functions like any other water pipe in your home. Ignoring it can lead to a burst pipe and a big repair bill."

Keep the dial at a consistent middle setting and adjust it as needed after the radiator gets into gear. Water radiators take longer to warm up than electric ones. Expect electrical radiators to take about 10 minutes to reach full efficiency. Remember that every radiator needs time before it begins working the way you want. The water or oil heats up first, then the heat radiates throughout the room."

For electric radiators, press the off button on the control panel to shut off the radiator\u2019s power supply.Turning a thermostatic valve will not shut off the radiator all the way. Use the thermostatic valve to control the temperature, but always go to the control valve to stop the radiator from emitting heat."

To clear it out, stick a piece of wire into it. Rotate the wire to scrape away any mineral buildup around the vent hole. Use a paperclip to easily clear out the vent. Straighten the clip out and push the end into the hole. Coat hangers and sewing needles are a few other options that work well. Painters often inadvertently cover the vent.
