          "description":"You need to be able to make a clean and straight incision into the pie, all the way through the crust. Plastic servers tend to be more flimsy, so buy a metal one that feels nice and sturdy. The server needs to also be offset by at least 2 inches (5.1 cm). The amount of offset is the depth that the flat part of the server dips down from the handle. This is what actually allows you to get underneath the pie crust. Look for a server that has a serrated edge on one side as this can sometimes help with slicing through crust."

          "description":"The pie doesn't need to cool all the way down to room temperature, but leaving it for 15 minutes or so is a good start. If it is a cold pie, the pie needs to be fully chilled before slicing; otherwise it may begin to fall apart or melt. Cutting a pie when it\u2019s steaming hot is actually incredibly difficult as the filling is much runnier when it is very hot. Letting the pie cool for a bit lets the filling start to congeal and thicken which will mean the piece holds its form when you cut it. 20-30 minutes is generally a good amount of time to let the pie cool."

          "description":"Make sure that when you push your knife or server down through the pie, you cut all the way through the bottom crust as well. Feel free to slice back and forth a few times to get all the way through the crust. The cut needs to start in the middle and go out to one edge rather than starting at one edge and going all the way to the other side. If you're pie server doesn't have a serrated edge, use a serrated knife."

At the outermost edge, the piece should be less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in width so you are minimizing the amount of pie that you will be \u201csacrificing.\" The purpose of this second cut is to create a very small piece that will sort of act as the \u201csacrificial\u201d piece. The first piece to come out of a pie is almost never pretty so what this technique does is minimize the impact of that one piece and lets you focus on the other pieces."

This piece may be a great option for a young child who doesn\u2019t really care that the piece isn\u2019t all that pretty and that it\u2019s also very small.
