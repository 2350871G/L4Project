          "description":"Draft your advertisement before you attempt to post it or put it on any signs. You don\u2019t need anything special to do this, and a free word program on your computer is more than enough. Type the ad out so you are able to refine it and make it as inviting as possible to potential visitors to your sale. When you\u2019re done, save it so you can easily copy and paste it for any online ads you plan on posting. Newspaper and sign ads are pretty much the same as ones posted online. You may need to shorten what you draft, but it works as long as you include the important information. At the very least, you need a title to announce the sale, a date, and an address. If you plan on advertising several different ways, changing up the ad could cause confusion. Develop a single consistent ad no matter where you plan on using it. A good advertisement is as clear as it is consistent. Typing it on your computer gives you plenty of chance to go back, read the ad out loud, and edit it until it sounds perfect."

If you have more relevant information that makes your sale stand out, include that as well. Some possibilities include descriptions like \u201cmulti-family sale\u201d and \u201ckid\u2019s garage sale\u201d to provide more information about what your sale covers. For example, you might write \u201cMoving after 25 years\u201d or \u201cNot your average garage sale:  professional flea market shopper decluttering.\u201d It provides a little extra oomph to your title that also suggests you have a lot of interesting items to get rid of.

For instance, write, \u201cFriday and Saturday, June 24-25th, 8 AM to 4 PM.\u201d Space out each part on a separate line to make your ad look neater.

For street signs, write the address in text as big as or bigger than the date so it is visible to anyone passing by. Landmarks are helpful to note if your sale is going to be tough to find, such as if the street name isn\u2019t recognizable. Mention landmarks like big stores, schools, churches, and monuments.

You might write, \u201cRoundtree Methodist Church, 123 Westmoreland Drive.\u201d Keep the address as short, simple, and visible as possible.

Another way to do this is to print out an online retail listing for your item. This works best for popular things like children\u2019s toys. Paste your price over the retail price to show people what they can save. People see the interesting items and stick around to browse even after they have sold.

The exception is with newspaper ads since you have to rely only on well-written text. Another example is to change the shape of the sign, such as by cutting it into an arrow that points to your sale. The unique shape stands out, but it also directs shoppers. Take down all ads after your sale is done. Many people forget to take down their signs and that\u2019s bad garage sale etiquette. If you don\u2019t take care of it, that leaves unhappy city officials and property owners to deal with it. Remove all your ads as soon as possible. It will also prevent any possible confusion with people looking for a sale that has already passed. Consider keeping a list of all the places you put up ads so you don\u2019t forget any of them. Leaving up old signs is often illegal and law enforcement treats it like a public nuisance. Stay out of trouble by taking care of your signs.",
