          "description":"For aluminum beverage cans, simply fill up them with water and dump it back out. If there is a lot of sticky residue on the can, you may need to rinse it several times. For steel food cans, rinse them out with hot water until any food residue is gone. Rinsing the cans eliminates odors and lessens the chance that insects and pests will be drawn to your recycling. Back in the day, you had to crush your cans before recycling them. This isn't a requirement anymore, but it could help save space if you're recycling a lot of cans on a weekly basis."

If your community has a specified recycling bin that each household needs to use, make sure to put your cans into that. If not, invest in a large plastic tote to keep your cans in during the days leading up to trash/recycling day. Some communities provide very large trash bins for recycling purposes, and it can be a pain to take a can out to the bin every time you finish using one. Consider keeping a large plastic or paper bag in your kitchen where you can deposit aluminum cans. Once it is full, you can carry the entire bag out to the recycling bin. If your community-designated recycling bin gets damaged or goes missing, request a new one through your city's waste management and recycling division."
