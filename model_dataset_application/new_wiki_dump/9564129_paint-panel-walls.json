Starting at the top of your wall in the corner of the room, wipe down from the ceiling. If you have particularly dirty spots on the wall, you might have to go over it a few times. If there are stains on your wall, especially any caused by grease, you\u2019ll need to use a specialized stain remover to get rid of them. Follow the directions on the remover you choose. Once you\u2019ve removed the other stains, wipe down the walls with a damp rag."

Scoop up a bit of compound on your finger, then dab it into the hole. Once the compound is dry, use sandpaper with a medium grit (60 to 100 grit) to sand the compound down until it\u2019s flush with the wall."

Don\u2019t sand them all the way down to bare wood \u2013 just enough to make the surface of the wall feel rough. Wear safety glasses and a paper mask that covers your mouth. This will prevent any of the dust from irritating your eyes or lungs. You might want to put down plastic sheeting or tarps to protect your floor from dust while you sand. You can also tape plastic sheeting or tarps over doorways to prevent dust from escaping and getting into other rooms. You can also cover or remove the room's furniture."

You can also use plastic tarps if you have any. Use painters tape to create a barrier between where you\u2019re painting and anywhere you don\u2019t want paint. When you\u2019re applying the painter\u2019s tape, make sure you place it right at the edge of where you want the paint to go. For example, if you\u2019re painting all the way down to the trim, put the painter\u2019s tape on the very top edge of the trim. This lets you paint the paneling all the way down, but protects your trim."

A paint roller with a medium nap should be long enough to do that. Look for rollers with nap that is about \u20448 in (0.95 cm) long. You can get these types of rollers from most home improvement stores. If you\u2019re unsure about the length of the nap, ask an employee for help."

You can find water-based primer at most home improvement stores in the paint section. To determine if the paneling is solid wood, check the edges. If you see growth rings on the edges of the panels, you have solid wood. You can choose to use a tinted primer that matches the paint color you\u2019ve chosen.

Most home improvement stores have shellac-based primer in the paint section. You can tell if your walls are veneer by looking at the grain pattern. If the grain pattern repeats in large sections, it's likely your walls are veneer. Real wood would have a greater variety."

Repeat this process until you\u2019ve got a 2 in (5.1 cm)-wide strip of paint all along the edge of the walls and ceiling. This will make it easier to then roll primer onto the rest of the wall.

Then roll your roller into it, coating the whole roller. Roll the roller against the dry ledge of your paint tray to remove excess primer so your roller doesn\u2019t drip. Then roll the primer onto the wall in vertical strips, making sure to get primer into the edges between the panels. You\u2019ll need to let the primer completely dry in between applications. Your can of primer should tell you exactly how long to wait between coats, but it\u2019s usually at least a couple of hours."
