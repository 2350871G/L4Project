The best method is to turn them into logs. See How to make newspaper logs for more details. These can be burned in a fireplace, barbecue, or cut down steel drum, etc."

      "description":"If you're a keen camper for sport or fun, you might have a ready supply of fuels at hand in your gear. Consider using your fuel and camping stove for heating water and cooking hot meals. Avoid using camping stoves for heating as it'll soon run out and do not use them indoors or in enclosed areas; be sure to use with plenty of ventilation."

      "headline":"Put candles to work to make a solid fuel source.",
      "description":"If you have plenty of candles in storage, try this method for turning them into fuel sources:\nCut stripes of corrugated cardboard into a width of about 2cm/ 1.5\". Roll this strip around tightly and squeeze it into a small round can such as those used for fish or small condiments. Melt the (paraffin wax) candles and pour the melted wax over the rolled up cardboard. Make sure it soaks through and fills any gaps. Burn when needed. This can be used for cooking, light, and minor heat. It'll last around 1.5 to 2 hours."
