The grain is the natural flow of the wood \u2013 the fibrous lines that hold the wood together. Planks are usually cut so that the grain lines flow down the length of the board. Sanding by machine requires that the machine sands with the grain of the wood. Sanding on the bias will destroy the wood's appearance, and you may find yourself shopping for carpet. Finish up the edges with a handheld power sander. Use a smaller, handheld sander to tidy up the areas that the electric sander might have missed--especially the edges of the room, or any part of the floor that's at all obstructed."

          "description":"When picking a stain brand, value quality over quantity; don't be afraid to spend 40 or 50 dollars on a gallon. When choosing a color, keep in mind that the stain will look very different over an entire room than it did on the sample chart. Understand that the color will soak into the wood and fade slightly. Pick a finish that goes well with the room, and pick one that you're willing to live with for a long time. Depending on the brand, you will need 1\u20132 gallons (3.8\u20137.6 L) of stain for an average floor. If you are attempting this for the first time, get a water-based stain: it is much easier to work with. Get a staining pad head with a detachable extension. The cheapest way is to get the replaceable pads. If you're using a semi-transparent stain, be sure to get the soft white fiber for staining, as the paint-specific pads will apply all but the solid color stain unevenly. A darker stain color can help cover up stains like dog urine that have seeped into the wood and won't come out with sanding."

This will also help to ensure even coverage. don't let the layer get too thick; you want a thin, even layer that will dry smoothly. Apply a small amount of stain to a small test area. The color may vary considerably from the display at the store. Be sure to stir the stain regularly during the application process.

Use a paint roller to evenly spread the polyurethane across the floor. Let it dry completely. Consider rolling out an extra coat for added protection and shine. If you do not want to use polyurethane, you can choose to wax and buff the floor instead. Try to stick to the base you used for the floor: if you chose a water-based stain, then be sure to use a water-based polyurethane clear-coat. Once you've applied the polyurethane coat, do not walk on the floor for 24 hours (or as long as the urethane packaging says that it needs to dry). If you walk on the floor before the coat is completely dry, you might smudge the gloss and leave unsightly blemishes across your hardwood.

You can wax a floor whether or not you stain it. If the floor finished, check whether it is dirty. If the existing top layer is scratched, but not dirty, you can simply apply a new coating of wax on top of the old layer. If the finished floor is dirty, you will need to thoroughly buff the floor before you apply a new coating. Wax soaks into the wood, so it is hard to fully remove. This makes the floor unsuitable for a synthetic finish, unless you hire a professional to strip the wax fully. You can easily apply new wax after you strip the floor."

Apply three or four thin coats, or as many as the wax product packaging recommends. Let each coat of wax dry completely before you lay down another coat. If your first layer is too thick, the whole process could fail to set properly. Be careful not to drip excess wax onto the floor. Make sure that the mop is damp, but not soaked.

After ten minutes of natural drying, you can point a fan into the room to make it dry faster. Do not point the fan directly at the waxed floor, or it might interfere with the adhesive. Read the label of your floor wax for a more accurate estimate of the drying time. Make sure that you've got an even coating, and that you allow it to \"set\" before you move on to buffing. Make sure that your wax needs to be buffed. Many waxes are no-buff, and they will remain glossy with no further effort.

It is best to buff the floor by hand, but you can also tie the towel around a dry mop head so that you don't have to be on your hands and knees. Get a clean, dry cloth and get to work, moving with the grain of the wood. Rub the wood hard enough that you can see the wax coming off onto the cloth. Make sure that the wax is completely dry before you begin to buff. Go over the entire floor three or four times, making sure to get as much wax as possible clear of the wood. Your goal here is to ensure that there's no excess wax on the floor, and that the wax that's there is sealing the wood. You can buff a floor whether or not you have stained it. If you have finished a floor by staining it, buffing ensures that you won't have air bubbles in the finish, and thus that the floor will last longer."
