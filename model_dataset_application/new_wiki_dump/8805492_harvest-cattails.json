Cattails are increasingly used for the purpose of cleaning contaminated wetlands, such as areas where there is industrial pollution and dangerous chemicals like arsenic. You should exercise caution wherever it looks like the plants may have been planted with the purpose of remediating a polluted area. Avoid picking cattails from ponds in urban or suburban developments. Cattails are often planted in order to help clean the contaminated water from the development. You should avoid eating these cattails, since they will have accumulated toxins. If you are harvesting the cattails to make rope, however, it is fine to collect them from these areas."
