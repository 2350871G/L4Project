          "description":"Find a room with a couch as the main focus, such as the living room or guest room. Gather enough pillows to cover the entire horizontal length of the couch and arrange them on the sofa to provide comfort. Choose pillows with varying patterns to create a mismatched look. Select complementary colors for a more cohesive look."

          "headline":"Lay mirrors against your walls if you can't put holes in them.",
          "description":"For homes with brick walls or people that don't want to use a hammer and nails, lay large mirrors against the walls. Angle them a bit to create the visual illusion that the ceiling line is higher than it actually is. Mirrors also brighten rooms by reflecting light and create the illusion of an additional window. Use mirrors in living rooms or spaces that need additional light."

          "headline":"Move cluttered furniture away from the wall to make the room seem larger.",
          "description":"If all your wall space is taken up by furniture, move some of the furniture 2 to 4 feet (0.61 to 1.22 m) from the wall to make the room seem larger. Group them together to create focal points that encourage different activities. Try and ensure that there are at least a few open spaces on the wall without furniture. Group chairs near the coffee table to encourage conversation. For couches, pull them a bit forward. This makes it easier to move around them and encourages people to take a quick seat and leave as they please."

          "headline":"Select a color scheme for the items on your mantle to create a room theme.",
          "description":"Choosing a common color for items on your mantle is a great way to unify unrelated objects with a theme. Select a color that stands out among the furniture in the room and begin searching your home for items in this color family. Books, plates, pottery, and pitchers are all great choices. Consider the other colors in the room. For example, if your home has a black and white theme, select these colors for items like plates, picture frames, vases, and small bowls."

          "description":"Find smaller plants that you can grow and nurture and cluster them together to give the illusion of space. Display and hang them at different heights. When they start getting bigger, transfer them into larger pots. Cheap indoor plants include pothos, aloe, spider plants, jade plants, and rubber trees. Ask friends with succulents if you can use their cuttings to propagate new ones and save some money."

          "headline":"Group your displays in odd numbers to liven them up.",
          "description":"Odd numbers are more visually appealing than even because they force your eyes to explore the grouping. Place any objects or frames you have on display in odd-numbered groups like threes or fives. For example, if you have 4 picture frames above your fireplace, remove one! You can also apply this rule to your furniture groupings, objects on countertops, and the number of patterns in each room."

To make the window look wider, extend the rod 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm) beyond the edges. Use 95 in (240 cm) curtains so that they are long enough to touch the floor and place the rod brackets about 8 inches (20 cm) above the window frame. Measure window width horizontally at 3 points and take note of the longest measurement. Sketch it prior to purchasing your curtains for reference. Install wall anchors if the bracket installation locations don\u2019t line up with wall studs."

Install two \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) cup hooks on each side of your curtains to hold your tiebacks in place. You can purchase them from hardware stores.
