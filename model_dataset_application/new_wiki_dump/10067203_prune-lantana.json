The fresh cuts encourage the plant to grow new stems and leaves. Cutting your stems at a 45-degree angle helps the plant recover from the wound more quickly and stay healthy."

          "description":"If you notice any damaged or decaying areas on your plants due to frostbite or other problems, it is best to remove them while pruning in the spring. To do this, line your pruning shears up to the stem at the start of the discoloration, and make a clean snip at a 45-degree angle. You can cut the damaged stems down to the ground or leave them between \u20442\u20131 ft (0.15\u20130.30 m), based on your personal preference. If you want a shorter shrub, chop it to the ground. This way, your plant will not waste any valuable nutrients on withered stems."

Make your snips along the stem at a 45-degree angle to encourage healthy growth. Work your way around the plant until it looks gorgeous and green rather than faded and droopy. To remove an entire stem, make your cut at the base of the stem. If removing parts of the plant, cut along the stem in between 2 leaves.

          "description":"If your plant looks overgrown, trim around the shrub to get rid of about one-third of its total mass. Make snips around the sides and top of your plant using pruning shears. Snip the stems at a 45-degree angle. Prune your lantana plant until it looks great, based on personal preference. If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, this likely occurs by September or October. Don't worry about making the shape perfect, as lantanas grow quickly and any uneven areas will soon be filled in. For example, if your lantana is outgrowing its garden bed, snip the plant back so it is contained inside the space."

          "description":"To do this, smooth the crown of your plant by snipping away long branches, extending leaves, and extra flowers. This keeps your lantana plant looking bush-like and controlled. You can do this once in the late summer or early fall or 1-3 times a month, based on your desired look. Position your shears at a 45-degree angle when you make your cuts. If you are pruning a vining lantana plant, snip from bottom to top. Pruning vining lantanas helps give them a full, dense appearance."
