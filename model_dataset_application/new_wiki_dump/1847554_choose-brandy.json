Decide if you want something plain and inexpensive, like plain brandy to chug, or if you\u2019re looking to invest in a finer, more expensive brandy that you can sip on like champagne.

          "description":"Pay a visit to your grocery store, or liquor mart. If you prefer to buy online, visit a wine distillery site, or a cocktail website and do a search for \u201cbrandy\u201d. Read the labels and descriptions for each bottle of brandy. This will give you an indication of whether it is where it came from, and how it\u2019s been distilled. Note that the longer a brandy is aged, the more valuable and finer tasting it will be. Understand that the brandy you purchase will either be fruit brandy, pomace brandy or grape brandy. Fruit brandy is most often used as a digestif or for cooking. It is the cheapest, most common type of brandy, and is distilled from fruit wine, and any fruit with the exception of grapes. This type of brandy will be colorless, un-aged and light on taste. Pomace brandy is also un-aged and is usually harsher tasting than aged brandies. Common Types of Brandy\nCognac is twice-distilled from fermented grapes from a region in France with the same name. Armagnac is also made from fermented grapes, but is only distilled once. Calvados is made in the Normandy region of France and is distilled from fermented apples. Pisco is a South American brandy made from distilled grape juice. Grappa is an Italian brandy made from the skins, seeds, and stems from grapes."

          "description":"Look out for special characters or fine print in the label or description for each type of brandy. Recognize that the finest of brandies, Cognac and Armagnac, for example, will be branded in a particular style category. This includes: VS (very special); also known as 3-star, VSOP (very special old pale), and XO (extra old). VS Cognac is aged at least two years, VSOP Cognac is aged for at least four years, and XO Cognac is aged for at least 20 years. XO is considered the most high-end of Cognac, or brandy. Understand that Armagnac is classified slightly differently from Cognac, in that VSOP Armagnac is aged for a minimum of five years. Armagnac that is considered Hors D\u2019 Age is aged for a minimum of 10 years."

A term like Grappa lets you know it was made in Italy or California. Recognize that a term like eau-de-vie is French for colorless, and often times, tasteless. If you\u2019re having trouble with figuring out the meaning, ask for clarification from a store clerk or someone else who\u2019s knowledgeable about the product."

Try drinking the brandy unadulterated, without ice or water. Pomace brandies, like grappa or Marc, may call for an acquired taste, and at the same time taste fruitier to you, due to its lack of age.
