Follow the fertilizer manufacturer's guidelines to prepare the correct concentration of fertilizer solution. Space the plants 24 to 30 inches (61 to 76 cm) apart. If the transplants are spindly or growing crooked, you can bury them in the ground up to the first set of leaves so the plants do not become top heavy."
