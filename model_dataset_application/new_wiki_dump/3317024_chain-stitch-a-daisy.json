For the sake of explanation, assume a 4mm/ 1/16th distance from A to B, which will make quite a small petal. Loop the thread under the needle tip. Pull the thread through slowly. To anchor the point B stitch, take the needle to back over the loop, at a position just above B. When done, you will have completed the first petal. Pull the thread through at point B.

  "text":" Five Petal Daisy Work with a single strand. Separate the strands of useful length the embroidery thread and thread one strand through an embroidery needle and tie a single knot at the end. Choose a point for the center of the daisy. This might be the middle of a button, a specific place on a canvas or on a pocket, etc. Bring the needle up through the chosen point, from the backside of the material. This will be called A, the center of the daisy. Make the first petal. Bring the needle back at A. Reemerge at a point distant from A (which is the end of the petal, named here as B). The exact distance from A to point B is determined by how large you need to the petal to be. For a button cover, this would be quite confined, while for a pocket, it could be much longer. For the sake of explanation, assume a 4mm/ 1/16th distance from A to B, which will make quite a small petal. Loop the thread under the needle tip. Pull the thread through slowly. To anchor the point B stitch, take the needle to back over the loop, at a position just above B. When done, you will have completed the first petal. Pull the thread through at point B. Then bring it back up under point A again. Make the second petal. Using the same method as for the first petal, bring up the needle at a new point (C) to make the next petal. This should be an even distance away from the first petal, at the same length. As with the first petal, make a loop, anchor the stitch and bring the needle back to point A. Make the third petal. This time, follow the same stitching method but come up at a third point (D), again evenly spaced across from C. With three petals in place, you will now have a \"Y\" shape. Make the loop, anchor and return to point A as for the first petal. Make petals four and five. Space these evenly between petals B & D and C & D to complete the arrangement. Use the same stitching instructions as for the first petal, returning to point A each time. Tidy up by knotting off and trimming off any excess thread.  Done. The five petal daisy is now completed. If wished, it can be finished off with a French knot to form the middle. Eight Petal Daisy Sew a French knot or neat circle to form the center of the daisy. This becomes point A for this daisy, only you will work from its edge and not its center when attaching petals. Use the same stitching sequence as for the first petal.  Sew four petals at evenly spaced places around the center of the flower. The petal ends should touch the circle edge each time. Sew four further petals into the spaces left between the first four petals. Keep them spaced evenly. Finished. Tidy up by knotting off and trimming off any excess thread.",
