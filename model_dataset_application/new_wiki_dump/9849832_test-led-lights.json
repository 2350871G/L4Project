Check online or at  your local hardware store for mid-to-high-range multimeters, which are more likely to have this feature than inexpensive models. A decent mid-range multimeter will likely cost between $50-100 USD. Opt for a digital multimeter over an analog model, which will be harder to read and less reliable."

Be sure to connect the black probe before the red probe, as the reverse might not give you an accurate reading. Make sure that the cathode and anode are not touching each other during this test, which may prevent the current from passing through the LED light and hinder your results. The black and red probes should also not be touching each other during the test. Making the connections should cause the LED to light up."

If no reading appears on your screen during the test, start again to make sure the connections were made properly. If you have performed the test properly, this may be a sign that the LED light is not working."

If it has a normal reading but looks dim, it is likely a low-quality LED. If it shines brightly, it is probably a high-efficiency LED light."
