          "description":"Aim on getting there before noon, since the day\u2019s heat and sunlight affect the chemicals in the water. If the pool\u2019s systems were turned off, turn them on and wait at least 15 minutes for the chemicals to disperse. As long as the systems were kept on for at least 15 minutes, you can collect the sample immediately."

If you have a plastic bottle, that\u2019ll also work and is easy to cap in case you want to bring the sample to a professional. Make sure you wash out the cup or bottle with soap so the sample is as accurate as possible."

If your pool is undrained during the winter, you will still need to perform the test once a week. Ideally, you should test the pool 2 to 3 times a week. Pool water shouldn\u2019t be allowed to freeze in winter. Lower the water level until it's below the skimmer and run the pumps normally. Stop ice from forming to protect your pool and collect samples easily!"

This is most helpful when you\u2019re unsure of a problem or how to improve it. For example, your pH level might be too high, but when you add chemicals to lower it, the alkalinity drops too low. Another example is when your water is green, but treating it for algae didn\u2019t work and you need to know if metals are causing it."

Make sure the strips come with a color chart printed on a card or the back of the bottle so you can interpret the results. Once you own the chart, you can purchase additional bottles of strips rather than whole kits. Another test variety are liquid test kits. You add the included chemicals to the water, then look for color changes. It can be difficult to mix the dye in the proper proportion and spot slight color changes. The last option is a digital water tester. Dip the end in the sample to get results. These are accurate but expensive and can malfunction."

For testing strips, you\u2019ll only need a single water sample. When doing a liquid test, pour a few drops of the dye into the water sample. You will need to collect a new sample of pool water for each dye. For digital testers, stick the sensor in the sample."

If you bought 4 in 1, 5 in 1, or 6 in 1 strips, several colored patches on the strips may change. Each one corresponds to a separate chemical measurement on your color chart. Strips that aren\u2019t all in 1 only test a single element. You\u2019ll need to go to the store and get separate strips for chlorine, pH, and alkalinity. Strips for cyanuric acid and water hardness are also recommended."

          "description":"Water testing below 7.2 is more acidic, so if you notice colored stains from metal or corroded pipes, low pH could be the culprit. Water above 7.8 is more basic, causing chemical deposits on pool gear and preventing chlorine from killing bacteria and algae. Both high and low pH water irritate eyes and skin. The pH level can be raised by adding soda ash, which is available at any pool store. Follow the directions on the label to figure out the proper amount to add. Lower the pH level by mixing in muriatic acid."

Chlorine prevents bacteria and algae, so low chlorine can be the cause of green water or illness. Chlorine is a skin irritant at high levels. If your pool uses bromine instead of chlorine, the color on the strip should correspond to a level between 2.0 and 4.0 ppm. Chlorine tablets are normal ways to raise this measurement. Get them at the store and put one in the chlorinator or skimmer basket every week. Chlorine burns off naturally in the day. You can lower it further by applying a neutralizing chemical like sodium thiosulfate or sodium sulfite."

High alkalinity causes scaling and cloudy water, while low alkalinity corrodes and stains pools. Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is the main product used for raising the alkalinity level. Muriatic acid or dry acid (sodium bisulfate) are effective for lowering the alkalinity."

It\u2019s also important for keeping the chlorine level consistent, so a low chlorine level could be caused by a lack of cyanuric acid. Cyanuric acid is added through regular usage of chlorine tablets. Adding a product called stabilizer, found at pool stores, also helps. To lower the cyanuric acid level, stop using chlorine tablets for a while and switch to chlorine shock. For immediate effect, drain some of the water and replace it with untreated water."

High calcium levels cause cloudy, scaly water. Chlorine shock is responsible for increasing calcium levels. To lower the calcium level, try adding a flocculant from the pool supply store.
