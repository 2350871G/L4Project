The assault kit is definitely the most popular among all the Battlefield 4 classes. The assault kit carries assault rifles, medic kits, and defibrillators. Use your medic kit to heal your team whenever needed. Perfect kit for newbies and players not looking into a specific role. The engineer kit is for vehicle and anti-vehicle jobs. They can repair friendly tanks, jets ect. They can also use their rocket launchers to destroy enemy vehicles. If you use vehicles a lot, the engineer will be the best for you. The support kit can supply and attack. They carry LMGs, ammo packs, and other explosives. Supply your team with ammo and be a heavy gunner! The recon kit is the long-ranged sniper. It will take time to learn to snipe. Learn to be stealth and to headshot. Only choose this class if you can use it successfully."

This game mode has been present in in the Battlefield franchise since its humble beginnings. In this mode, 2 teams compete for capture points (flags) on a map. Rush. This mode essentially gives a team the task of defending certain points in the map (M-COM stations). Team Death match. This mode is pretty straight forward and seems to be popular among online players. Simple rule of this game mode \u2013 kill many enemies as you can. In Team Death match, working together as a team really matters since teamwork affects the tide of the battle. Squad Death match. This mode puts 4 squads against each other where the squad with most kills at the end of the match wins the 4-way battle. Obliteration. In this newly added mode, one team is tasked to defend high-value targets while the other team tries to destroy them - thus the name, Obliteration. Elimination. Another new mode which is a more strict Team Death match. Stricter in the sense that once a soldier is killed \u2013 it won\u2019t re-spawn. In short, it is permanently eliminated. Defuse. The last newcomer in the game mode category. Again, this is a non-re-spawn mode where a team defends a spot while the other attacks it. Pretty much like Rush\u2019s mechanics. Domination. Another favorite. This game mode revolves around teams trying to capture flags across the map as they battle for territorial supremacy. Air Superiority. Speaking of supremacy, this mode is all about air supremacy. This is for those who can maneuver air vehicles and eliminate enemies with it. Capture the Flag. This game tasks a team to get hold of an enemy flag and bring it back to their own home base. The team with the most flag capture wins."

If you are an Engineer, make sure you focus on making yourself useful via vehicles. Engineers are most effective when they eliminate enemies inside vehicles. For Recons, make sure you find a good spot for sniping. After a few kills, you can change location so you won\u2019t giveaway your where about. For Support, as the name suggests, make sure you support your teammates. Be on the lookout for ambushes and always be there for support firepower for your Assault class.
