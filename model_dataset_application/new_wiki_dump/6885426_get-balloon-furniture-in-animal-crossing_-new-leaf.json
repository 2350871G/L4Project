They originate from the far edges of your town, so keep an eye out for them. You can usually tell they\u2019ve spawned when you hear a whistling sound."

      "description":"Now, when you see one, grab your slingshot and press A! You might need to chase them down for a bit, but with good timing and persistence, you can definitely down that pesky balloon and loot the rewards. Just a warning though: if you shoot it down over water or flowers, the present will be destroyed. The present can also be destroyed if it lands in the center of a 3x3 pattern layout. Your character will even make a shocked facial expression when that happens. If you\u2019re on the town cliffs near the beach, you can pop them with any tool since the balloon will be drifting quite close to the player at this point. The trick to having good aim shooting the balloon down is to stand on its shadow as you shoot it."

If you\u2019ve popped enough Balloons, sometimes a Toolbox will be attached instead of a present, and will yield a Gold or Silver Slingshot instead. Silver Slingshots fire two rocks while Gold ones fire three."
