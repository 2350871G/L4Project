If you're using shortening, consider adding \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of butter extract to give your fondant a buttercream flavor. Although you can use regular vanilla extract, it makes your fondant slightly tinted. If you don't have a stand mixer, use a wooden spoon to combine the ingredients."

Once you've added all of the powdered sugar, turn the mixer to medium and beat the fondant until it's stiff.Tip: If you're using butter instead of shortening, add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch when you add the powdered sugar. The cornstarch stabilizes the butter, which makes it easier to handle. To mix the fondant by hand, turn it out onto a powdered-sugar coated surface and knead it by hand to make a stiff dough."

To prevent the buttercream fondant from drying out, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and put it into an airtight container. Store the fondant at room temperature for up to 1 week. Although refrigerating the fondant extends storage time, refrigeration introduces moisture which makes the fondant too sticky to roll out."
