  "text":" Preparing to Jailbreak Download the jailbreak file. Go to the jailbreak file hosting site on a computer, click the red Download button, and click Allow if your browser asks to store files on your computer. Once the transfer finishes, the jailbreak ZIP folder will download onto your computer. The jailbreak file can take a while to download, so you should start the download process before moving on to other preparations. Format a USB flash drive to FAT32. Do so by choosing \"FAT32\" in the \"Format\" drop-down menu during the formatting process. This will ensure that the flash drive can be used to update your PS3 later, though formatting your flash drive will also delete any files currently on it. The flash drive must be at least 8 gigabytes in size. Leave your flash drive plugged into your computer after formatting it. Determine your PS3's model number. Look on the back or the bottom of the PS3 for a serial code which begins with \"CECH\" and has several numbers (or a letter and some numbers) after it. Compare your PS3's model number to supported models. Models of PS3 which can be jailbroken include the following:\n\nFat \u2014 All PS3 Fat models are supported. Slim \u2014 If the first two numbers after \"CECH\" are \"20\", \"21\", or \"25\", and if your PS3 is below version 3.56, your console is supported. Super Slim \u2014 No versions of the Super Slim model of PS3 can be jailbroken. Figure out whether your PS3 is NAND or NOR. Depending on your PS3's model number, you can determine the type of PS3 you have, which will determine the type of custom firmware (CFW) you use later:\n\nFat \u2014 If the first letter after \"CECH\" is \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"E\", or \"G\", the console is NAND; for all other letters, the console is NOR. Slim \u2014 All supported Slim models are NOR. Creating the Firmware Check Drive Extract the jailbreak ZIP folder. This process will vary depending on your computer's operating system:\n\nWindows \u2014 Open the ZIP folder, click the Extract tab, click Extract all, and click Extract at the bottom of the window that appears. The extracted folder will open when the extraction finishes. Mac \u2014 Just double-click the ZIP folder to extract it. The extracted folder will open when the extraction finishes. Open the Step 1 folder. Double-click the PS3 Jailbreak Kit folder, then double-click the Step 1 - Minimum Version Checker folder. Copy the PS3 folder. Click the PS3 folder, then press Ctrl+C (Windows) or \u2318 Command+C (Mac) to copy it. Paste the PS3 folder onto your flash drive. Open your flash drive by clicking its name in the lower-left side of the File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) window, click a blank space, and press Ctrl+V (Windows) or \u2318 Command+V (Mac). Once the folder finishes pasting, you can proceed. Eject the flash drive. Now that the flash drive is set up for your PS3, you can use it to check your PS3's firmware. Determining Your PS3's Compatibility Plug your flash drive into your PS3's right-most USB slot. This is important, as using any other slot may cause the process to malfunction. Go to the firmware number's location. Select Settings on the main menu, select System Update, select Update via Storage Media, and select OK when prompted. Review the firmware number. The number to the right of the \"Update data of version\" text must be listed as \"3.56\" or lower. If you see a number above 3.56 listed, you cannot jailbreak your PS3, and attempting to do so will cause irreparable damage to your console. Creating the Installation Drive Plug the flash drive back into your computer. Now that you know that your PS3 is compatible with a jailbreak, you can create the installation drive. Again, if your PS3's firmware number is higher than 3.56, you cannot jailbreak it as attempting to do so will brick your PS3. Remove the PS3 folder from the flash drive. Simply delete the PS3 folder to do so. Open the Step 2 folder. In the extracted PS3 Jailbreak Kit folder, double-click the Step 2 - 4.82 Rebug & Jailbreak Files folder to open it. Copy the Step 2 folder's contents to the flash drive. Click and drag across both the \"flsh.hex\" and the \"PS3\" folder here, press Ctrl+C (Windows) or \u2318 Command+C (Mac), and then open your flash drive and press Ctrl+V (Windows) or \u2318 Command+V (Mac). Eject your flash drive again. You'll now proceed with plugging the flash drive back into the PS3 for the last time, making sure to keep it there until the jailbreak is complete. Installing the Firmware Plug the flash drive back into the PS3's right-most slot. The flash drive will have to stay here until after you've completed the jailbreak process. Open the PS3's web browser. Select the www icon on the PS3's home screen. Set the \"Blank Page\" option as your home page.
