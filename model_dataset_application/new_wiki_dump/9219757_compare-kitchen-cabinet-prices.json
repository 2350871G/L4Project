While they're often made with materials like particle board over wood, some budget cabinets hold up over time. Prices tend to be around $70 per foot. Read reviews when purchasing budget cabinets. Some brands actually hold up very well for the price, so you can save money on a budget cabinet with great reviews. The major downside to budget cabinets is that they don't have a lot of variation in terms of style and design. If you're looking for a very specific look for your kitchen, budget cabinets are probably not for you."

Mid-level cabinets are sometimes made from very cheap materials, however. Look for cabinets made from plywood over particle board."

BuyVia and ScanLife are apps that let you scan barcodes to search for cheaper prices. They include both local options and national outlets and are easy to use in the store.
