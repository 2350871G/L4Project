      "headline":"Scout (Mostly Offense): The scout can take points twice as fast and push the cart x2, so he should be used for an offensive role.",

    {
      "headline":"Soldier (Generalist): The soldier is the most versatile class in the game.",
      "description":"He can be classified as the Jack of All Trades. He is also fairly easy to play. On almost every occasion, a Soldier can be useful to a team, be it stopping the cart, taking a control point or destroying an enemy sentry nest."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Pyro (Moderate Offense): The pyro is better suited for offense, however, it is also a utility class due to his compression blast.",
      "description":"Pyro lacks serious long range capabilities, so it cannot afford to wait for the enemy to enter into friendly territory."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Demoman (Slight Defense): A demoman is pretty similar to soldier, except his grenades do not explode immediately after hitting a wall.",
      "description":"He also has sticky bombs which he can detonate whenever he wishes. He can be used to delay the enemy from entering a choke point."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Heavy (Slight Offense): A heavy can push through the enemy defense, but he is not good at entering deep into enemy territory by himself as he will be overwhelmed, due to the fact that he cannot sneak around the enemy base.",
      "description":"He is more suitable for holding an existing area."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Engineer (Mostly Defense): The engineer builds a sentry, then sits back and watches as people that come into the sentry's range are quickly mowed down.",
      "description":"He is pretty weak on his own (arguably the weakest) and also, he often has to watch after his buildings lest they get destroyed. Therefore it is ill-advised for him to enter the enemy area."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Medic (Moderate Defense): The medic should not enter into enemy territory as he is  pretty much defenseless against the other team.",
      "description":"He should stay near the battlefield and heal his teammates."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Sniper (Pure Defense): The sniper barely gets any movement on the battlefield as his job is to sit, wait and then to picking off enemies.",
      "description":"He is not a suitable class for when the team needs to push forward, as he is better at taking out unsuspecting enemies that come out of chokepoints. On offense, his main purpose is to counter-snipe (take down the enemy sniper)"

    {
      "headline":"Spy (Pure Offense): The spy should go into enemy ground and wreak havoc, and he has the tools to do just that.",
      "description":"He can sneak behind enemy lines undetected and then backstab the opponents. Literally. Spy may be good on some occasions as a defender, but if your team is getting rolled, it is better to be a stronger class such as Heavy or Soldier."
