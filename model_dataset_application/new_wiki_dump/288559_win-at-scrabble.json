When looking for candidate plays, you also want to make sure your remaining tiles don't contain an imbalance of consonants and vowels, or contain duplicate tiles that will inhibit you from making a high scoring play next turn. Make sure that you exchange some of your letters if you end up with too many vowels. You should not have more than 2-3 vowels on your rack at any one time. Letters in the word RETAINS are the most versatile and useful, so consider hanging on to these letters."

Therefore, it is a good idea to make plays using these squares. Doing so will increase your chances of winning the game. Try to play words that cover multiple premium squares. For example, if you play a word that covers two triple word squares in the same turn, the word you played will be worth 9 times as much as normal."
