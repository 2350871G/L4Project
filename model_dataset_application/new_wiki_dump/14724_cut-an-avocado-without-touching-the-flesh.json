  "text":" Use a medium-sized sharp knife to cut lengthwise around the avocado.  Let the knife follow the contour of the avocado by pressing the knife blade into the flesh touching the large pit. This will guide the knife making the process easier to cut the avocado into halves. Twist the two avocado halves while pulling the two lengthwise pieces gently apart.  Use a knife to remove the pit from the avocado.  Whack the knife firmly into the pit.  Twist the knife and the pit will be removed from the avocado half.  Place the avocado half onto a cutting board.  Use the knife to cut a cross-hatch pattern into the avocado flesh.  Use a spoon to scoop out the avocado pulp.  Repeat this process with the other avocado half.  Alternatively, use a spoon to scoop out the avocado flesh, if the avocado is ripe and with soft flesh. Otherwise use the cross-hatch cuts for easy removal of the avocado pulp. Cutting the avocado into 1/2-inch strips is another method for removing the avocado pulp. Hold the unpeeled avocado half in one hand, slice down the center, being careful to cut only through the pulp. The avocado half will then have a center-wise cut through the pulp. Cut the remaining strips into slices. Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh. Repeat with the other half. This gives nice, clean avocado slices with no mess.",
