          "description":"Pipes are often white or metallic-colored, which can really stand out from the rest of the building. Hide these eyesores by repainting them. Choose a color that blends in with the building to hide the pipes. Alternatively, you can paint them a different color from the building but that still compliments it. This is more decorative. You have an option between spray paint and roll-on paint. Both will work fine, but the application is different. Spray paint is faster to apply but could make a mess, so you have to cover everything carefully. You also can't apply it in windy conditions. Roll-on paint is easier to control, but more time-consuming to apply. Weigh these strengths and weaknesses to choose an option."

          "description":"Whichever type of paint you use, you;ll need to keep your work area clean. Spread a cloth or sheet around the pipes to protect the grass. If you're spray-painting, tape newspapers to the walls of the building to protect them. Remember to wait until the wind dies down to spray paint. Otherwise the paint will get everywhere."

          "headline":"Wipe the pipe down with mineral spirits.",
          "description":"Take a clean rag and wet it with mineral spirits. Wipe down the entire pipe. This removes any gunk or residue that will interfere with the paint. Mineral spirits are usually not irritating, but wear gloves if you have sensitive skin. Run your skin under cool water if you directly touch any. You can buy mineral spirits at most hardware stores."

          "description":"Whether the pipes are metal or PVC, they'll still need to be sanded before painting. This roughs the surface up to grip the paint better. Sand the entire surface of every pipe you're painting."

          "description":"Primers come in spray or roll-on types. Each has the same strengths and weaknesses as spray or roll-on paint. If you use spray primer, hold the can 6 inches (15 cm) away from the pipes and spray it on. For roll-on primer, wet a roller and apply an even coat to the pipes. Let each sit for 3-6 hours to dry. The type of primer you use has no bearing on the type of paint you have to use. If you use spray primer, you don't have to use spray paint, and vice versa."

          "description":"With all the prep work done, begin painting. Apply an even coat of paint with either a roller or a spray can. When you've covered the whole pipe, let the coat dry for 4-6 hours. Add a second coat, then enjoy your newly-painted pipes. The drying time depends on local weather conditions. If it's humid, it will take longer. Check if the paint is dry by pressing it lightly. If it feels wet or sticky, it hasn't dried yet."

There are all types of pipe covers available. Some are just a solid color, and some look like rope wrapped around the pipe. Look at the options to find one that appeals to you.

Use some lumber and build the wall to your own specifications, or find a pre-made covering in the hardware store. Find a color that blends in or complements the building and paint the wood. Then, drive the covering into the soil in front of the pipes for a solid covering. There are many design styles you can choose from. A slatted design gives a more rustic look to the building.

Place the shed in front of the pipes to cover them completely. Depending on how high the pipes are, you may just be able to use a small storage box for the same purpose. Remember that some areas have laws mandating how close a shed can be to a home. Check all your local laws to make sure you don\u2019t violate any building codes."

That way, you can still maintain the pipes without removing the shrubs. Make sure any plants you use have shallow root systems that won\u2019t damage the pipes. Some evergreen shrubs and viburnums are good choices. Ask a landscaper for recommendations if you aren\u2019t sure which plants are best for your property."

If ivy grows naturally on your property, let it grow up the pipes to hide them. Otherwise, plant ivy in a planter under the pipes and press it against them. The ivy will naturally start growing up the pipes. Ivy can potentially damage bricks walls or siding if they have cracks or crevices for the roots to enter. Keep the ivy trimmed so it only grows on the pipes. Do not plant English ivy. This is an invasive plants species that some communities have banned. Remember that if you need any maintenance on the pipes, the ivy will have to be removed. Ivy grows fast, however, so you can replace it within a few weeks."
