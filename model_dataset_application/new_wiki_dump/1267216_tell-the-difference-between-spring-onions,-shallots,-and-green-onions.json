          "description":"Look for something that looks like a tiny onion at the base of a green stem (which fades from lime to emerald green upward from the bulb). The stems are usually thicker and sturdier than green onions to support the bulbs. Spring onions are a more mature version of green onions, hence they have a larger bulb. Most markets and grocers sell spring onions with the bulbs attached and the tops of the stems trimmed down to about 4 inches (10 cm) to 6 inches (15 cm) long. They\u2019ll often be sold in a batch of 5 or 6 bulbs with the tops attached. True to their name, spring onions are harvested in the spring, so depending on where you live, you\u2019re more likely to see them at farmer\u2019s markets around those times."

          "description":"If you notice there are small bulbs that look similar to garlic at the base, those are shallots. They grow in tight clusters and typically look a little like small brown onions, only more elongated. You\u2019ll be able to spot them because they aren\u2019t sold with the greens on top. Shallots come in purple, brown, and gray varieties (the gray ones are especially rare and considered to be a French delicacy). Shallots are harvested in summer and fall, so that\u2019s usually the best time to eat them. You can also give them a sniff\u2014they have a zingy, sulfuric smell."

You\u2019ll also notice a small puff of white or tan tendrils (often referred to as the \u201cbeard\u201d) coming off of the bottom of the white base. Green onions are a more mature version of scallions and have a milder flavor than other varieties. Green onions are available throughout the year.

Green onions are available year-round, so they might look more familiar to you since they\u2019re more likely to be a store staple. If possible, purchase each variety at the same time so you can do a taste test. Keep in mind that the availability of each type may change slightly depending on where you live."

Soak the shallots in a bowl of hot water for 2 to 3 minutes to help remove the outer skins. Lightly saut\u00e9 the bits in butter or oil to bring out the shallots\u2019 zippy flavor.

The white part of the green onion has the strongest taste, but it still won\u2019t taste as pungent as the bulb of a spring onion.

Saut\u00e9 whole green onions with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) to 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive or canola oil to use in stir-fries and other warm dishes.
