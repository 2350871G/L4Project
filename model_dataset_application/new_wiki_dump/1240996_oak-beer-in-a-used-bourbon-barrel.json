      "description":"Used barrels can be ordered online or through homebrew shops. Distilleries may have used barrels available. Bourbon is whiskey, with a mash bill of at least 51% corn,  made in the United States and aged in charred, new oak barrels. It's fine if the metal banding on the barrel is rusty, but the wood should not be overly deteriorated. There may be residual bourbon in the barrel. It's a good sign if there is, because the oak should stay wet in order to prevent shrinkage of the wood and resulting leaks. The barrel's bunghole should also be securely sealed with a rubber stopper, as this will help to ensure that the inside of the barrel has remained moist and free of external contaminants. A barrel with residual bourbon also probably won\u2019t harbor a large amount of microbes because alcohol is antimicrobial, although wood will always harbor certain microbes that actually give oak beer desirable sensory qualities."

      "description":"Bourbon barrels have a capacity of 53 gallons (200.6 L). If you're a home brewer, you'll most likely need to brew quite a few batches to fill one barrel. This is quite doable, however, since the barrel will be filled with fermented, uncarbonated beer. Just have your full carboys or conical fermenters ready when you're going to fill the barrel, or invite some friends to brew together."

      "headline":"Drain off any residual bourbon.",
      "description":"Invert the barrel and drain the bourbon through the bunghole. The residual bourbon will contain charcoal because the inside of bourbon barrels are charred. The residual bourbon will contain a fair amount of charcoal particles. Removing the residual bourbon serves to remove these charcoal particles, but you'll also end up with some bourbon that you can filter with a cheesecloth and drink or use as desired."

      "description":"Put the barrel on a platform that, if desired, can be moved with a forklift or pallet jack, such as a small wooden pallet. Screw or otherwise fasten blocks to the platform that will keep the barrel from moving, but never drill, screw, or nail into the barrel itself."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Fill the barrel with beer.",
      "description":"Fill the barrel with uncarbonated beer using any means that you have available. Use a siphon, sankey-keg filling line, or other such means. Leave a little head space. Use a flashlight to monitor the fill level. Be sure to sanitize the filling equipment, as you want to prevent as much microbial contamination as possible, even though the beer will become contaminated in the barrel to a certain extent. Don\u2019t be overly concerned with preventing oxidation, as the beer will oxidize to a certain extent while aging in the barrel (oak barrels are somewhat permeable to the outside air). However, it should be fine to purge the barrel with CO2 in order to prevent initial oxidation, and it's always a good idea to place the end of the filling tube at the bottom of the barrel to prevent splashing, which is a major cause of oxidation."
