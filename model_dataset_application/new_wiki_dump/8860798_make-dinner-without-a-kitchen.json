Instead of stocking up on everything you\u2019ll need for a week or two, make smaller purchases and more frequent trips to the store. For fresh items, purchase only what you can eat without refrigerating."

To keep your food from spoiling, you should consider purchasing items that don\u2019t need to be refrigerated \u2013 like canned goods or dried food. Dried fruits, rice cakes, nuts, canned vegetables, canned meat (tuna, chicken, etc. ), peanut butter, and honey are great options for making dinner or a snack without a kitchen."

You can even purchase some smoked tofu to add to your meals for a nice source of protein.

You can use the coffee pot to boil water to make instant rice, ramen noodles, boil eggs, or even to add hot water to instant packages (like mashed potatoes). You can wrap a sandwich or quesadilla in aluminum foil and apply the clothes iron to heat it up and melt the cheese."
