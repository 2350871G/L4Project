If you rent a moving truck, how much will it cost to rent the size you need, and how many days and miles will that rate cover?

You can also look into \"self move\" services, which drop off a containing unit, let you load it at your leisure, and pick it up and transport it for you. There are sites where you can describe your needs and people will make bids as to how much they'll charge to do it for you. As with all your research, you want to ask how much it'll cost, how long it'll take, and how you're guarded against damages. Books can often weigh a personal vehicle down significantly. Fear not! They can be shipped through the USPS at 'media rate'. Another often ignored option is using the greyhound shipping service which offers a huge discount to students.

Most automobiles, reliable or not, should receive a major maintenance visit to the mechanic (with special attention to radiator, transmission, and brakes) before embarking on a cross-country trek. The cost of the maintenance could save thousands (literally) in emergency repairs, towing, etc. If you're considering pulling a trailer, does your vehicle have enough horsepower to pull it across the distance and landscape you're looking at? Driving across a country often means driving across different elevations, climates and terrains. Can your vehicle make it up and down a few mountains? Are the brakes in good shape? Does it have a tendency to overheat? Do the air conditioner and the heat work? Check the weather. Weather.com and similar websites can actually give you the weather of your travel route. Consider things like mountain passes, if possible avoid them or be prepared to put chains on your vehicle if the situation requires it. Map your destination online and don't leave home without a current Road Atlas. Decide if investing in a satellite navigation system for your car is within your budget."

          "description":"Determine the fuel efficiency of the vehicle you'll be using so that you can estimate how much the fuel will cost. Find out how many miles or kilometres your trip will cover, then divide that number by your MPG (miles per gallon) or km/l (kilometres per litre). That will tell you how much fuel you will need to cover the entire journey. Multiply that number by the current or expected price per gallon/price per litre to see how much money you'll be spending on gas through the whole trip. Example: If your trip is 2,000 miles and your car gets 30 miles per gallon, then 2,000 miles / 30 miles = 66.5 gallons, approximately. If the price of fuel is at about $4 per gallon, the fuel will cost 66.5 gallons x $4 = $266. Example: If your trip is 1,000 kilometres and your vehicle travels 15 kilometres per litre, then 1,000 km \u00f7 15 km/l = 67 litres, approximately. If the price of fuel is at about \u20ac1 per litre, the fuel will cost 67 litres x \u20ac1 = \u20ac67.
