Set the pressure between 2000 PSI and 3000 PSI--anything lower won't be as effective in cleaning, and anything higher may damage your concrete. If you are using a pressure washer, wear gloves and safety glasses for protection from the high-pressure water and/or loose debris."

          "description":"Start cleaning the patio by pouring a mild all-purpose cleaner like Mr. Clean or Simple Green on the area and scrubbing with a bristle brush. A hand brush would work for smaller areas, but for larger areas, you may want to consider using a push broom. For really tough dirt and stains, use a stronger cleaner like bleach or specially-formulated concrete cleaner. Be sure to protect any surrounding grass or plants because the chemicals can harm them. For an effective natural cleaner, try mixing equal parts of vinegar and water and using in place of the other cleaners."

Allowing the stain to dry during the process will create lines in your work, so work quickly to avoid this. Pour some stain into a shallow tray. Dip the roller brush into the stain and coat it evenly. Don't put too much stain on the brush because it can cause drips and make your work area messy. Roll the brush along the surface of the concrete in short, even strokes. Once you have the area completely coated with the stain, allow it to dry before adding additional coats. You will need a minimum of two coats, but you can add a third coat depending on the look you desire."
