  "text":" Preparing rosehips Pick the rosehips when they turn a ripe red or orange colour. Use scissors to remove them from the stem, then trim away the petal ends and stem piece to leave a clean hip. Remove any insect damaged or blemished parts. Cut the rosehips in half and remove the seeds. This is easiest done with a sharp knife and a small spoon. As this is a more time consuming task, it's good for small quantities, such as if you only have one or two rosebushes. Rosehip jam Measure the weight of the prepared hips and add about half the amount of weight in water. For 450g (15.8 oz) of hips, 250ml (8.4 fl. oz) of water is a close approximate guide. Simmer the hips and water together until soft. This will take about 15-20 minutes; it takes less time if they're covered with a lid. Puree the hips or push them through a sieve or mouli to pulp them.
