Pure and simple: simply buying the cheapest option available without regard for quality is cheap. Meanwhile, identifying the best item that will meet your needs and getting the best deal possible is frugal."

For instance, watch out for flabbergasted comments such as, \u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re charging $9 dollars for a burrito!\u201d and \u201cI won\u2019t pay more than $5 for a beer.\u201d\nKeep in mind that it\u2019s perfectly fine to have these thoughts and to make your personal spending decisions accordingly. That said, if you\u2019re the one that's always exasperatedly decrying the cost of items your peers happily pay for, you probably sound cheap."

Furthermore, it\u2019s important to realize that a better option will usually last longer than a cheaper option, and you may wind up spending less overall by avoiding repairs and other costs. For instance, those dollar store flashlights you keep needing to replace are adding up. You could have simply bought a higher quality flashlight years ago and still be using it today."

This can be tricky in some social situations, but communicate clearly in early discussions about cost. This will help you avoid scenarios where you wind up trying to talk your way out of paying your share later on. For instance, maybe you plan to attend a bachelor party and a couple of the other attendees wanted to rent a limo. Weigh in on the conversation and offer a more frugal option before the decision is made if you want, but don\u2019t say something like \u201cI didn\u2019t agree to that!\u201d when the time comes to split the bill. Another classic example that isn\u2019t fooling anyone: \u201cI forgot my wallet.\u201d  Instead of saying something like this, ask if you can pay them electronically, or pay them when you get home."
