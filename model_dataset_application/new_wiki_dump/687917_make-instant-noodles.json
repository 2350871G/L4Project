Let the water heat for five to ten minutes until the water comes to an active boil. Water is boiling when large bubbles of water are rising to the surface. An active boil has many large bubbles rising. Some kettles have a \u201cwhistling\u201d feature. When the kettle whistles, your water is done boiling. You can also boil water in the microwave if necessary. However, the water can become superheated and explode out of the cup, causing severe burns."

However, some brands of instant noodles require a longer or shorter cooking time. Check the back of the package for these cooking times.
