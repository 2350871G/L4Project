  "text":" Preparing Set up your cleaning station. If you are in the bathroom, you can just use the sink. If you are in a bedroom or living room, lay down a towel to protect your surfaces and the figures.

Cleaning Your Figure Look for any dirt, grime, or smudges on your figure. If you spot one, take the swab/Q-tip, and dip it into the water. Don't let it get too wet; it only needs to be damp! Carefully brush the dirty part, and set it down when completed. Repeat the process until the figure looks clean. For a base or stand, take a wet wipe, and wipe it across the base. Then let it dry. Dry the parts. Once all the dirty parts are clean, carefully dry them off with the towel, one by one. Now you have cleaned your figure!
