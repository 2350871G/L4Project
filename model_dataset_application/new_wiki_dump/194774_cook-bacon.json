It's usually best to fill the skillet with strips rather than attempt to cook 1-2 pieces at a time\u2014this usually causes the meat to burn.

Cooking Bacon in the Oven Preheat your oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C). Make sure you have a rack in the middle of your oven with plenty of space above it. If you need to, adjust the rack to the center of your oven. Take your bacon out of the fridge to start warming up as you work. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Pull off a sheet of aluminum foil and spread it over the bottom of your baking sheet. Curl the foil around the rimmed edges. This prevents grease from escaping the pan, which can potentially start a grease fire. Spread the bacon strips out flat on the baking sheet.

If you do, the strips will continue to cook for 1-2 minutes and might scorch. Draining the bacon on paper towels keeps the meat crispy. Using a Microwave Cover a microwave-safe plate with 3-4 layers of paper towels. The paper towels will help soak up the grease as the bacon cooks. If you put the bacon directly on the plate, it will end up grease-logged and chewy. Lay the strips out on the plate and cover them with 1-2 paper towels. The bacon strips shouldn't be overlapping, but you can put them close together. Lay another paper towel gently on top of the bacon to prevent grease from splattering. Cook the bacon for 1 minute per strip on HIGH. Close the microwave door and set the cook time. For example, if you have 4 slices of bacon, set your microwave's timer for 4 minutes. You don't need to flip the strips over or do anything at this point. Keep cooking in 30-second intervals until it's as crispy as you want. Check the bacon and continue cooking in 30-second bursts if you want it to be crispier.

Customizing your Bacon Marinate your bacon in maple syrup to make it \"Vermont Style.\" Put your strips of bacon in a bowl and cover them with real maple syrup. Cover the bowl and put it in the fridge for 30 minutes before proceeding with your preferred cooking method. The caramelized sugars might make a mess as they cook, but the resulting bacon will be worth it! Cure your bacon in brown sugar before cooking it.
