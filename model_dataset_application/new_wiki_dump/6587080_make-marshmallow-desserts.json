  "text":" Marshmallow Strawberry Kebab Melt the chocolate. To make a chocolate sauce for the marshmallow kebabs you must first obtain a source of chocolate such as a chocolate bar, chocolate chips or chocolate melts. Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, set the microwave setting to lowest heat and microwave for 30 seconds. The chocolate chips must be microwaved for 10 seconds otherwise they will burn. After the chocolate has cooked, mix it and leave it to cool. Put your strawberries and marshmallows on the kebab in a pattern. Do this when the chocolate sauce has cooled so that it isn't hot.

Mini Marshams Put a mini marshmallow on top of a toothpick. Afterwards, stick one big marshmallow onto the bottom of the toothpick and keep pushing the marshmallow until it reaches the mini marshmallow. Add a toothpick to the sides of the big marshmallow.
