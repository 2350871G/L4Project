Regardless of what type of pasta you\u2019re using, leave the noodles to cook until they are al dente. This allows the pasta to be edible if it is thawed naturally and stops it from going mushy if it is reheated. Set a timer to help remind you to check the pasta. Cook penne pasta for about 9 minutes.

If you are having the pasta for lunch, leave it at room temperature to thaw. If you are eating the pasta for dinner, leave the noodles in the fridge to thaw.
