      "description":"Usually when you do a hard bucket challenge, they give you less time to get to a certain destination. But when you follow the route, you don't make it in time. The only way to beat it is to improvise your own route where it is far away from the route. When you improvise the route, you have to be careful because depending on if you are in storm island or at the horizon, there are certain obstacles that can come your way like trees, boulders, and walls."

      "description":"The key to winning a hard challenge is not braking because braking slows your car down and kills time when it comes to doing the challenge. Instead of braking, try to drift but control the left stick on your xbox controller so it won't rotate the opposite direction. An easy way to drift is to either tap LT and control the left stick or tap A and control the joystick."
