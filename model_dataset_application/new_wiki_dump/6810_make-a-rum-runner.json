There are countless variations on the ingredient list of a basic Rum Runner - we've provided just a few in this article (see recipes above). The Original Rum Runner is just what it sounds like - classic Rum Runner goodness. A delicious tropical staple drink. The Fancy Rum Runner is all the rage among the smarter set. With highbrow ingredients like blackberry brandy and spiced rum, this drink is a cut above the rest. The Basic  Rum Runner is for the partygoer who wants a no-frills drink. With common, affordable ingredients, this variation delivers refreshment on a budget. The Islamorada Rum Runner, named for the drink's town of origin, is a drink for those with a sweet tooth. Mostly sweet-and-sour mix by volume, this drink goes down smooth. The Holiday Isle Rum Runner is extra-tasty and extra-strong. Incorporating 151-proof rum into the drink, this variation offers tropical flavor with a kick."
