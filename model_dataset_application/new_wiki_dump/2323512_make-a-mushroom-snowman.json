The top mushroom needs to be the smallest (preferably a button mushroom), while the two descending mushrooms need to be larger than the head mushroom but either similar in size to each other, or one slightly larger than the other. All mushrooms should be rounded to help give the impression of a snowman. Large, flat mushrooms just won't work."

Choose an unblemished part with enough room to add all the facial features. Poke two evenly spaced eye holes into the mushroom. Stick two little raisins or similar food pieces inside each eye hole. Carve a small hole in the middle of the face. Insert the tip of the carrot in for the nose. Carve a small smile on the face (optional but cute)."

Balance the next slightly smaller or same-sized mushroom on top of the first mushroom, again open part facing downward. Balance the head mushroom on top. Place the button mushroom on the middle mushroom, upside down with the stem sticking up to the ceiling."
