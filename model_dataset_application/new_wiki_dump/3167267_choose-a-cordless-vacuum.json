More expensive vacuums have more features and feature newer batteries but there are lesser known brands that are cheaper and will work as well but they'll lack certain features so for the sake of meeting the budget you'll need to find a middle ground as you narrow down the list."

Supposed want something more robust that you can use as a shop vacuum - get something with an attachment that has large nozzle so you can pick up larger debris. If you're cleaning mostly dust, then get something that has brushes on its attachments to be able to better clean up statically charged dust that tends to stick on surfaces."
