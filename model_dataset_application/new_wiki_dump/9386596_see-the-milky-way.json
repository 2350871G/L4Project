You may be able to see parts of the Milky Way as early as March or as late as August. Between November and February, however, it is not visible."

You can use an almanac or a weather website to learn when sunset and sunrise will happen on any particular day. Use this to plan your trip."

Since the Milky Way appears in the southern sky, you should travel south of any major cities. If you do this, the light from the city will not interfere with your viewing of the Milky Way. Nature reserves, mountains, deserts, and other unsettled areas are great places to view the Milky Way.

Before going out to see the Milky Way, pick a clear night with either a new moon or a crescent moon. Most weather services will tell you both how many clouds there will be as well as what phase the moon is in. Several apps, such as Luna Solaria or Moon Phase Plus, will tell you what phase the moon is in."

If it\u2019s autumn, look slightly to the east. Keep in mind that the Milky Way will not look like any pictures you may have seen of it.

Attach the widest lens you have. For the best results, place the camera on a tripod. Point the lens so that you have the widest view of the sky as possible before taking the picture. If you can, adjust the shutter speed based on the size of your lens. Divide 500 by the diameter of your lens. Use the result to set the shutter speed. For example, if your lens is 25mm, then you should set your shutter speed to 20 seconds. You may need to adjust the contrast later to get the best results."
