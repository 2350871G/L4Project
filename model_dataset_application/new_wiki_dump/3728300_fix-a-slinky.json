Turn the stack at an angle and fit it through a gap in the next tangle, so it joins the next length of slinky where your finger and thumb followed it. Once it's through, put the neat stack back on your fingers. Sometimes, it's easier to hold the stack in place and lift the next loop of the tangle over and around the end of the stack."
