Stuff the squash. This may require you to make additional space by scraping out some of the squash flesh; only do this enough to enlarge the cavity, then mix the scooped flesh in with the stuffing, then reinsert the stuffing mix into the squash. Scrape the flesh from the skin with a spoon and place it into a bowl. Mash it with butter, salt, and pepper and serve it hot. For an additional flair, serve it inside its own skin."

Scrape all seeds and loose threads from the center cavity of the squash. Save the seeds for roasting just like pumpkin seeds. Using the Savory Recipe Place both sides of the squash, cavity side up, into an oven-safe casserole dish or cake pan. Very lightly sprinkle salt, pepper and any herbs you might like over the inside of your squash. (Sage is particularly nice with winter squash.) Some also prefer to brush the surface with olive oil or butter before seasoning. Pour water into the dish to a depth of about two inches. This will keep the squash from drying out.
