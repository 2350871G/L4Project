A pickleball looks like a whiffle ball with slightly smaller holes. It is also a little harder. Pickle paddles look like ping pong paddles, except they\u2019re more rectangular and 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) larger on each side.

A pickleball court is 44 by 22 feet (13.4 m \u00d7 6.7 m) and divided in half by a net. Each side is divided into three zones, with the left and right serving boxes flush against the base line on each side. Tip: If you don\u2019t have a pickleball court nearby and you don\u2019t own a collapsible net, you can use chalk and a measuring tape to draw out the dimensions on a tennis court.

Lob the ball in front of you with your nondominant hand, and firmly strike the bottom of the ball with your paddle. Your serve must bounce in the serving box on the opposite corner from where you\u2019re serving.If a serve bounces in the kitchen, it is a fault and the next serving player serves. A fault is a mistake, and means that the serving team has failed to score by serving incorrectly, sending the ball out of bounds, or letting the pickleball ball bounce.

Tip: The player on the right side of the court is always player 1, and the player on the left is always player 2. The same is true on the opposite side, so player 1 always serves at the other player 1 and vice versa. If the serving team doesn\u2019t let the ball bounce, it is a fault and play stops.
