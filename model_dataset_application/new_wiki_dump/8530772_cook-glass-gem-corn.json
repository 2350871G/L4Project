To blanch the corn, you need to bring the water to a boil first. You can also add a few teaspoons of salt to the water. You should also have a bowl of ice water prepared. After blanching the corn for three to five minutes, remove it from the boiling water. Place it in the ice water until it's cool enough to touch."
