Magnets won't stick to solid brass, but they will stick to brass-plated steel and other metals. If the brass is solid, you can follow some of the same general steps. However, solid brass can take slightly harsher chemicals, such as a strong brass cleaner, rather than just a mild one."

You can also test an inconspicuous place with a bit of brass cleaner. If it leaves a black spot on your rag, that means it's not lacquered.
