Lay your squash on a cutting board or some other kind of cut-safe surface, and use your knife to cut it down the middle into two even parts. Lay each part so its soft core is pointing upwards and use a spoon to scoop the seeds from the squash's center.

          "description":"The two most common ways to cut your squash is by cutting each half into several pieces lengthwise or width-wise. The way you cut your squash will depend on how you want to present it after grilling. You should cut the squash into pieces ranging in size from 3/8 to \u00bd inch (1 to 1.3 cm) thick. This will make it easier to skewer. Cutting your squash lengthwise will result in french fry shaped grilled squash. Your kids might even find this veggie more palatable in this form, especially if give this food a fun name, like \"squash fries.\""

Slide the skewered piece toward the base of the skewer, then add another piece in this fashion until all your pieces are on the skewers. You should leave some space between your pieces of squash on the skewer. Packing them too closely together can result in them being uncooked in the middle. If you plan on using wooden or bamboo skewers, you should soak these for a half hour before hand to prevent them from burning or getting charred."

You can also use the corners or sides of the grill where your veggies will be more distant from the heat of the flame. Using medium heat when grilling your squash will help you achieve the best results."

You'll be able to tell when your squash is done by its lightly browned sides and tender consistency. Poking the squash with a fork should help you discern its tenderness.
