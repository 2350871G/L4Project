          "description":"Thick slabs of frozen fish will take a long time to cook, but you can reduce this by wrapping them in foil or parchment pouches. The ice crystals in the fish will turn to steam, remain trapped in the packet, and help cook the fish more quickly. Increasing the cooking speed is especially important for high-heat cooking methods, as described below:\nGrill fish in tightly closed foil packets, to prevent the outside charring while the inside cooks. If pan-searing the fish, do not wrap the fish. Instead, cover the pan once the fish begins releasing juices, to trap steam that helps cook the fish evenly."

This makes it easier to rub oil, butter, or marinade into the fish, and to get spices to stick.

Frozen fish can take twice as long to cook as fresh fish, but you're still saving time by skipping the thawing stage. This is only a general time estimate, and the actual amount of time required varies base on the thickness of the fish. Check on the fish every couple minutes, using the following tips to tell when its done:\nCut a slit with a sharp knife. When done, the fish will be completely opaque near the surface, and just starting to become opaque in the center. If you have a food thermometer, cook the fish to an internal temperature of 145\u00baF (62.8\u00baC)."

Thawing overnight is the recommended method whenever you have the time. Keep your fridge below 46\u00baF (8\u00baC) to keep your fish safe, and cook with 48 hours. Frozen foods will produce water as the ice melts, so keep your fish in a container that can catch water. To avoid waterlogging your fish, you could punch holes in the base of that container, and place it above a second container that will catch the draining water. While most fish will thaw within 8 hours, massive amounts of fish could take up to 24 hours."
