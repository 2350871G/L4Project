          "description":"The outside of the card is where you'll do the most adornment. Pick a theme based on the season, the occasion, or the person you're making the card for. Pressed flowers that you lightly glue to the card can make wonderful and eye-popping 3D decorations in the springtime, sprucing up a card with a natural highlight of color. It's a great idea for people with a green thumb. You could also add shells to summertime cards for a unique touch. This works especially well for gift tags or other types of place cards."

          "headline":"For a simple touch, collage a few pictures.",
          "description":"Saving old school books, kids' books, magazines, and newspapers can be a great source for making cards. If you don't have a big store of them laying around, hit up a local thrift shop for extremely cheap (or even free) piles of cut-up magazines that you can repurpose for your cards. Nature magazines are a great source of card-material, as well as magazines that feature lots of advertisements. The high contrast colors in magazine ads look great when cut up for cards. For a real shortcut, you could even consider saving your old cards and cutting shapes from them to reuse in new cards. Repurpose those old Christmas cards you always recycle by cutting out the manger scene or the Christmas tree from the front and putting it front and center on your own card. No one will know the difference, and you'll save money."

          "headline":"If you can, include original drawings on or in your cards.",
          "description":"You don't have to be a great artist to be a great card artist. Depending on your audience, a silly stick figure comic or a diagram of your feelings would be a hilarious gift for a holiday or other special occasion. If you can actually draw well, even better. Decorate the card with your own artwork for a personalized touch your friends and family will treasure."

          "headline":"Go for elegant and simple.",
          "description":"Adding a few tasteful adornments to your card is generally better than making something too busy or too cluttered with decoration. A simple white card with a pressed flower on it will look thoughtful and elegant, making a great message to give someone. Avoid making your collage too busy. A good combination of two pictures culled from a magazine or book can be poignant, cute, or hilarious. Don't clutter it with fifty pictures of your friend's favorite Baseball player for a birthday card. Maybe go for one good one with a well-timed funny caption for effect. Do more with a little."

          "headline":"Don't be afraid to make it weird.",
          "description":"Quirky holiday cards are usually better received than deadly-serious ones. Little jokes, non-sequiters, or weird pictures of sea creatures should be welcomed and embraced in the card-making tradition. Your family's never heard of the Hannukah Squid? Time to change your traditions. Cut out an idyllic holiday scene being attacked by floating clouds of squid with Santa hats and HAPPYNESS in all caps on the inside. The less sense, the better. Making something weird doesn't mean you should send a crude card to your mother-in-law for her favorite holiday, or that you should try to make a funny sympathy card, but you should send something that the receiver will appreciate. Know their sense of humor and make them chuckle."

          "description":"cardstock, like the name suggests, is perfect for making your own cards. It's basically thick, high-quality paper that you can buy at any craft store in a variety of vibrant colors and prints. Depending on the kind of card you want to make, it's usually good to get a few different colors and layer them for a cool effect. For a professional-looking card, it's common to get two different varieties of complementary colors to make each card. After cutting different shapes or sizes of cardstock (one smaller and one larger), you can paste the smaller evenly into the center of the larger to create a unique look. When you fold other, this creates a nice surface on which to write your message. You could even use basic printer paper on the inside to avoid bulking up the card."

          "headline":"Cut the basic shape of the card.",
          "description":"Once you've selected the outside color for the cardstock, cut it to size. A standard-sized greeting card is a rectangular shape, about 5 x 7 when folded in half. Because you haven't folded it over yet, use your ruler to measure out a square roughly 10 x 14 and cut very carefully with your scissors. You want the straightest edge possible, so use a paper cutter if you've got access to one. Also cut a piece or two from a different color of cardstock. Cut these a bit smaller than the card by an inch or two on each side and center it on the outer piece. Glue it securely with your glue stick and let it dry thoroughly before folding it in half. You can also do the same thing on the other side of the card, give it both a unique inner surface with texture and an outer surface. Experiment with shapes and placements depending on your style, mood, and the season. You could cut diamonds or other shapes from the interior piece to give it an extra flair. A snowflake would be perfect for a wintertime card, or a heart might be perfect for Valentine's cards."

On the inside of the card, write a few sentences for your message, sign it, and send it on its merry way. If you've gone to the trouble to make your own unique card for a gift, you don't need to include a long-winded message. \"Merry Christmas!\" would be perfectly appropriate for a holiday card. For a birthday card, it's appropriate to use your own sense of humor to offer a birthday greeting: \"Happy Day Old Man\" might be funny for your dad or your brother, but not necessarily for your boss. For casual but sincere messages, here are some possibilities:\nMany happy returns. Stay young, buddy. Happiest of Birthdays! Here's to a whole bunch more. Analog Text: Happy Birthday. So proud to know you. Happy Birthday! For romantic cards, get mushy as quickly as possible without going over the top. Some simple but romantic messages:\nYou mean so much to me. Love you. So glad we could spend this day together. Loving you. I'm crazy about you. Here's to the future. I'm so glad you like me more than your dog does. Love.

If you're feeling stuck on thinking of a message you'd like to include, feel perfectly free to quote something and let someone else speak for you, or to go for the ultimate simple message: \"Merry Christmas\" or \"Happy Birthday\" or \"My sympathy.\" Bible verses are particularly common for Christmas and Easter cards, though might be somewhat preachy for other kinds of cards.

That's why we're going out tonight.\" \"Happy Nondenominational Winter Celebration.

It's typical to include a recent photograph of yourself or your family, especially for extended family you might not often see. The end of the year is a good time to get in touch and let everyone know what you've been doing and that you're thinking about them. Include a recent picture of your family, along with a brief note out the year's accomplishments and activities. To make it easier on yourself, make several copies of a basic card, but then handwrite a brief message in each and include a longer form note that you send out to everyone. If you choose to write a year-in-review note, think about the right tone. Avoid the bragging about the litany of destinations on your European tour when you're writing to your working class relatives in Tulsa. Instead, say, \"We were fortunate and lucky to travel some this year.\" Likewise, a holiday letter isn't the time to depress all your family members with a list of everything that's gone wrong for you in the year.
