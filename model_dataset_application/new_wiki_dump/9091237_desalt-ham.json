Cover the container with a lid or aluminum foil. Then place the container in the refrigerator for at least 2-4 hours. This will help reduce the saltiness of the ham. You can soak a ham for up to 72 hours to remove the saltiness. The longer you soak it, the less salty it will be. If soaking the ham for more than 4 hours, make sure you change the water regularly. Replace the water every 2 hours to reduce bacteria growth."

If it is still too salty, try boiling it for another one or two minutes. Do not boil the ham for longer than necessary to remove the salt. Doing so can result in tough, dried out, or unappetizing ham."
