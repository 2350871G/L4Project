Ask for email addresses if you\u2019ll just be sending out evites, or mailing addresses if you\u2019ll be creating physical invitations. If the party is going to be a surprise, you\u2019ll need to contact a couple different friends or family members of the guest of honor to try to get an idea of all the people who should be invited."

          "description":"You'll need to get an idea of how many people to expect before you can decide on a space, since 50 people might not fit into someone's studio apartment. Since the guest of honor\u2019s belongings will be in boxes, avoid trying to schedule it at their home. If no one volunteers to host, research local parks if the weather will be nice, and look for areas that have picnic tables and public restrooms. Call local restaurants to see if they have a party room available. If the party will be at work or school, mention which room it will be in on the invitation."

          "description":"Make sure to select a time that will work for most of the guests. If you\u2019re throwing the party for a coworker, schedule it during everyone\u2019s lunch break. If it\u2019s a school day party, throw it during lunch, recess, or immediately following the last class of the day. Otherwise, pick a time the weekend before your guest of honor is leaving. Avoid picking the day before the person is supposed to leave. They may have a lot of packing left to do, and a party could just add to the last-minute stress."

If you\u2019re doing a more formal event, perhaps at night or where a meal will be served, send out invitations 3-4 weeks in advance. You can mail the invitations if the party is a few weeks away, but if it\u2019s within two weeks, you risk not giving people enough notice. It\u2019s safer to just design an online invitation on a site like Evite and email it to the guests."

Are they moving to England? Hang a British flag on the wall, place teacups around the room, and write \u2018\u2019Cheerio!\u2019\u2019 on a chalkboard. If they\u2019re moving to California, opt for a surfing theme and decorate with seashells. Other possible themes include \u2018\u2019Bon Voyage\u2019\u2019 (decorate with airplanes and maps) or \u201cAdios Amigo\u201d (decorate with sombreros and a pi\u00f1ata).

Natasha Miller\t\t\tEvent Planner & CEO, Entire Productions\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: When you're choosing the theme, consider how the venue might play into it. For instance, a theme like \"Into the Wild\" would be perfect for a party at a natural history museum. If your venue doesn't give you an obvious theme, try writing down as many different ideas as you can think of, then narrow it down until you get to something you really love."
