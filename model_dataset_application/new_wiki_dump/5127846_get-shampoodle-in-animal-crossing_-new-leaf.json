      "description":"This can be split between clothes from Mabel and accessories from Labelle. Most items for sale at Able Sisters ring in around 200\u2013300 bells a piece, so this will require you to buy quite a bit. You could save these wardrobe choices in your closet to prepare for Gracie's fashion checks, gift them to your villagers, or you could simply sell them back at Re-Tail for a loss. By spending money in the shop, you are supporting the town's local economy and enabling the Kicks shop to open next door."

Kicks sells shoes and socks, which are important items to have down the road to coordinate for Gracie's fashion checks."
