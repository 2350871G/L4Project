          "description":"Combine the chopped onions, olive oil, garlic, cumin, oregano, chiles, cider vinegar, and salt in a blender or food processor. Blend the ingredients together at medium to high speed until a thick puree forms. Do not drain the adobo sauce from the chipotle chiles before adding them. You should pour the sauce into the blender along with the chiles."

          "headline":"Layer the sauce, beef, and broth in the slow cooker.",
          "description":"Spread the sauce into the bottom of your slow cooker. Place the beef on top of it, and pour the beef broth over the meat. Place the bay leaf on top. Coat the beef in the sauce by turning it a few times, dipping all sides in the sauce at least once in the process. Use a 5-qt to 7-qt (5-L to 7-L) slow cooker for best results. Cut the beef into several chunks, if necessary, to fit it into the slow cooker."

        {
          "headline":"Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours.",
          "description":"If you want it done sooner, set the slow cooker to high and cook the beef for 6 hours. Resist the temptation to open the lid and peek at your meal as it cooks. Doing so releases the trapped steam, and that steam is partially responsible for cooking the meat. As a result, the overall cooking time can increase 15 to 30 minutes every time you open the slow cooker."

        {
          "headline":"Shred the beef.",
          "description":"Remove the beef from the slow cooker and place it on a cutting board or rimmed baking sheet. Use two forks to shred the beef into pieces, working from the outside in. While shredding the beef, you should also discard any fat. A rimmed baking sheet or cutting board works best since some of the juices inside the beef can run as you work with it. Without a rimmed surface, these juices can create a big mess."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Mix the shredded beef with the barbacoa sauce.",
          "description":"Transfer the shredded beef to a large bowl. Ladle a little of the cooking liquid into the bowl, mixing after each addition. Add enough sauce to keep the beef thoroughly moist, but do not add so much that the beef drown in it or becomes soupy. If you have some cooking liquid left behind after you coat the beef, you can fill a spare ice cube tray with it and freeze the liquid for later use. These cubes of barbacoa sauce can be used to flavor stocks, soups, gravies, and other dishes later on."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Keep it warm in the slow cooker.",
          "description":"If you are not ready to serve the barbacoa yet, return it to the slow cooker and switch the appliance to its \"warm\" setting. You can keep it warm using this method for another 2 to 4 hours. After that point, you should consider transferring any uneaten beef to airtight containers and storing it in the refrigerator. Reheat it in the microwave after refrigerator storage."

Do not add any oil, butter, or margarine to the pan before toasting the chiles. Turn the chiles occasionally as they cook. When done, set the chiles aside for a couple of minutes until they are cool enough to touch. Once cool, you need to remove the stems, seeds, and veins.

If using a coffee grinder, make sure that it has been thoroughly cleaned before use and is thoroughly cleaned after use. Otherwise, you could end up with coffee-flavored sauce or cumin and clove tainted coffee."

Remove the chiles from the water and add them as well, along with 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of the chile-infused water. Cover and blend at a medium to high speed until a smooth paste forms. A food processor could be used instead of a blender, but either way, you need to produce a smooth paste when done. Stop the blender occasionally and scrape the sides down with a spatula before continuing to blend."

Keep the cover on the roasting pan while the beef rests. This resting period allows the beef to finish cooking and forces the juices to distribute themselves more easily.
