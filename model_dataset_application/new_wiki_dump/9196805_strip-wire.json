If you don\u2019t know the gauge, or if your tool isn\u2019t labelled, place the wire in each notch to find a match. The wire should fit snugly into the notch."

Line it up so the jaws are about an inch (two to three centimeters) from the end of the wire. If you\u2019re using the wire for an electrical project, you\u2019ll only want to strip the insulation off of the tip. If you\u2019re stripping wire for scrap, it's more efficient to just slice down the length of the wire with a utility blade instead of pulling off a little bit at a time with wire stripping pliers."
