Choose a suit pattern in your desired style and size. You can find suit patterns in a craft supply store, fabric and sewing supply store, or online. If you do not want to purchase a pattern, there are free suit patterns that you can download and print. Just search the internet for the type of suit pattern you want."

The envelope will also list additional materials you\u2019ll need, such as buttons, zippers, thread, etc. Opt for a heavyweight fabric to make your blazer, unless you are creating a summer suit, and then use a medium weight fabric instead. Heavyweight fabric choices for blazers include wool, tweed, velvet, and corduroy. Medium weight choices include linen and cotton."

Reading the instructions allows you to preview the project, make sure that you have all the needed supplies, and note any important information about the pattern, such as what the symbols on the pattern mean. If there\u2019s anything that\u2019s unclear about the pattern, ask someone who has experience sewing suits to explain it to you. For example, you could ask a friend or family member for help or pose the question on an online forum for tailors."

          "description":"Check the pattern\u2019s instructions to identify the pattern pieces you will need. Before you cut out the pattern pieces, trace along the desired size lines with a red pencil or highlighter. This will help to ensure that you cut out the pieces in the correct size. Then, use a sharp pair of scissors to cut along the lines. Different groups of pattern pieces for a design are usually indicated by letters, such as A, B, and C.  For example, if you\u2019re making a 2-piece suit, you\u2019d only need the pieces for the jacket and pants, but if you\u2019re making a 3-piece suit, you\u2019d need the pieces for the jacket, pants, and vest. The 2-piece suit might be marked with an A while the 3-piece suit pieces might have an A and B or just a B on them. Cut slowly and carefully to avoid creating any jagged edges or going over your desired size lines."

You\u2019ll likely need 2 of some of the pieces, so fold the fabric first and then pin the pieces to the folded fabric. Be sure to follow any special instructions that the pattern includes for how to pin the pieces onto the fabric. For example, you may need to pin certain pieces along a folded edge and avoid cutting that edge of the fabric. This is common for the back panel of jackets and vests since they tend to require larger cuts of fabric.Tip: If your material is delicate, place weights on the pattern pieces instead. Avoid putting pins through the fabric, which may damage it."

Follow the edges of the paper pattern pieces as you cut the fabric. Go slowly to avoid creating any sharp edges or going over the edges of the paper. Make sure to cut any notches out of the fabric that are indicated along the edges of the paper pattern pieces. These are important for lining up your pieces when you sew them together. Don\u2019t remove the paper pattern pieces from the pieces you cut out right away. Keep them in place so that you will be able to tell the different pieces apart."

If you spot any of these special symbols on the interior of a pattern piece, use a piece of fabric chalk or a fabric marker to trace them onto the fabric pieces.

In most cases, you\u2019ll be pinning the pieces with the right sides facing each other so that the fabric\u2019s raw edges will be hidden on the inside of the suit. Insert pins perpendicular to the edges of the fabric where indicated by your sewing pattern. Place 1 pin every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) along the edges of the pieces. For example, if you\u2019re attaching one of the front panels for the suit jacket to the back panel, you\u2019ll need to pin the pieces starting along the edges of the 2 pieces that will go under the armpit and go all the way to the bottom of the 2 pieces."

Sew a straight stitch about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the raw edges of the fabric to hem the jacket sleeves and pant legs.Tip: If you\u2019re making a suit for yourself, have a friend help you fit the suit while you\u2019re wearing it."
