  "text":" Preparing Ingredients and Tools Buy a sausage making/filling machine. This will aid in the filling of the sausage linings. A manual mincer and filler can cost anywhere between $25 and $75. It should be stainless steel for easy cleaning. A small mincer will clamp to your kitchen counter or another surface and you will turn a crank to insert the sausage stuffing into a casing. Clean and disinfect the area you plan to use to make sausage. Place used dishes in the dishwasher immediately, in order to reduce the possibility of contamination. Wash anything that came into contact with raw meat. Procure your pork. Buy 1 2.2lbs. (1kg) of minced pork shoulder. You can also buy the pork shoulder and grind it yourself if you own a meat grinder. Buy 7 oz. (200g) of pork back fat. You can dice some back fat at home, but you may need to buy it from a butcher. Using back fat in addition to the pork shoulder will increase the fat content of the meat, making it juicier and more like traditional Spanish chorizo. You can leave out this ingredient if you would prefer a leaner product. Mix the Spices Mix 1.5 tbsp. (25g) of fine salt, 1.5 tbsp. (10.35g) of smoked paprika, 1.5 tbsp. (9g) of crushed fennel seeds and 1.5 tbsp. (9.5g) of crushed black pepper into a small bowl. Stir the spices together with a fork or a whisk.  Crush 3 cloves of garlic. Wait to add them when you incorporate the rest of the ingredients. Mix the Chorizo Place the minced pork shoulder and diced fat in a large bowl.  Sprinkle the minced meat with the spices and 3 crushed garlic cloves.  Add 1/4 cup (59ml) of Spanish red wine.  Put on some plastic food service gloves.  Knead the meat, spices and wine together for several minutes. You want to mix the spices into the meat uniformly; however, you do not want to mix the sausage for too long. After prolonged kneading, the fat can start to break down, which will change the flavor of the meat. Mix only to the point of uniformity. Sausage Casing Set up your sausage mincer machine. If you have not done so already, buy natural sausage casings from your butcher or Internet food specialty store. Place your first sausage skin below the nozzle on the sausage mincer.  Load the meat mixture into the top of the mincer.  Turn the crank or manually press the meat mixture downward until it feeds into the sausage casing.  Twist the sausage skin several times every 12 inches (30cm) starting from the bottom up. This will allow you to form individual sausages. Continue to fill up the sausage skin and the mincer by hand.  Prick each sausage casing lightly with a toothpick to remove air pockets.  Tie a knot in the casing of the last sausage when you have used all of your mince.  Curing Chorizo Identify a place in your house where it is cool, dry and sanitary. Choose somewhere well-ventilated. Hang your chorizo from the ceiling for 1 to 3 months.  Cook on a grill, in an oven or in a frying pan after it has cured. You can separate the sausages and use them individually. Finished. ",
