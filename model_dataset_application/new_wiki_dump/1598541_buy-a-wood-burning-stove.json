          "description":"Unless you live in an extremely cold climate, you\u2019ll most likely need a medium-sized stove that doesn\u2019t generate more than 20,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs). Most stoves that generate enough heat to warm an average-sized home between 2\u20133 cubic feet (0.057\u20130.085 m) in volume. Wood-burning stoves within this size range will typically generate 5,000\u201320,000 BTUs. As a general rule of thumb, you will need 25 to 30 BTUs per square foot to adequately heat your home. For example, a stove that is rated at 60,000 BTUs will heat a 2,000-square-foot area, whereas a stove rated at 42,000 BTUs will cover about a 1,300 square feet (120 m)."

          "headline":"Opt for a larger stove if you have drafty, open-plan home.",
          "description":"Homes with primarily open floor plans or homes that are larger than 3,000 square feet (280 m) need large, powerful stoves to provide enough heat. The same applies if you live in a frigid northern region. In this case, purchase a stove that\u2019s larger than 3 cubic feet (0.085 m) in order to generate adequate heat for a large, cold home. If your home is noticeably drafty, talk to your homeowner\u2019s association or a local contractor and see about having the drafty rooms repaired."

          "description":"If you live in a cabin or in a 1- or 2-room home that\u2019s smaller than 1,500 square feet (140 m), you can get by with a small stove that doesn\u2019t provide much in the way of heating power. To heat your small home, purchase a small stove that\u2019s less than 2 cubic feet (0.057 m) in volume. Most small wood stoves are very efficient and can put out more than enough heat to warm a small home. They\u2019re also a much cheaper option than heating a small home with electricity or space heaters."

          "headline":"Select a cast-iron stove for a traditional, slow-heating option.",
          "description":"Wood-burning stoves are made of either cast iron or steel. Both materials are highly durable and do an effective job of putting out heat into your home, but cast iron tends to take longer to heat up due to the density of the material. This also means that the stove will retain the heat and continue putting it out for hours. Cast iron stoves also occasionally leak air through their seams, and you may need to hire a stove specialist to come and re-seal the seams every 8-10 years. Historically, cast-iron stoves were considered higher quality since damaged parts could be easily replaced. Today, though, plenty of manufacturers are creating high-quality steel stoves. Some people also prefer the clean, blunt aesthetic of the cast iron wood burning stove."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Decide on a steel stove for a fast-heating option.",
          "description":"The steel used to make steel wood stoves is typically thinner than cast iron, so the stoves start putting heat out into your home more quickly. However, the fact that steel stoves heat more quickly means that they also lose heat relatively quickly. So, opt for steel if you want quick, short-lasting heat from your stove. Some people prefer the shiny look of steel, but that's a matter of personal preference."

          "headline":"Buy a catalytic stove if you'd like a stove that puts out consistent heat.",
          "description":"Catalytic wood stoves contain converters that allow gases and fumes to heat repeatedly, resulting in a fire that is longer lasting and burns more evenly. Because of the recycling system in these stoves, they emit fewer pollutants into the air. These stoves are a little more complex than other options, though; they need to have a hot internal temperature before they start producing heat, and the catalytic converters must be adjusted based on the fire's temperature\nThere are a couple of downsides to catalytic wood stoves. These stoves are more expensive (they run from $700-3,000 USD). Catalytic stoves also must be cleaned regularly, since ash and soot builds up in the body of the stove and up the chimney."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Choose a non-catalytic stove for a cheap, low-maintenance option.",
          "description":"Like fireplaces, non-catalytic stoves lose large amounts of heat because of how they are vented. Unlike a catalytic stove, they do not recirculate heat, and therefore lose a certain percentage of warmth. However, they do not require as much maintenance as catalytic stoves and need to be cleaned less frequently. Non-catalytic stoves are very common on the market and less expensive than catalytic stoves. Unfortunately, they're also less environmentally friendly, as they circulate more pollutants into the atmosphere than catalytic stoves do."

          "headline":"Select a pellet stove if you live in a suburb or city.",
          "description":"While pellet stoves can't provide quite as much heat as a wood stove can, they require less cleaning and maintenance. Pellet stoves are a common choice for people who live in an urban setting, since pellets are easy to transport and can be stored indoors. People that use wood stoves need to dedicate a large outdoor area to storing the wood, which isn't feasible if you live in a city. Pellet stoves are also less labor-intensive to operate than wood stoves are. Chopping, stacking, and carrying your own wood supply can take up the better part of a week! Pellets are much easier to manage. Pellet stoves often contain electric components, making them more expensive than lower-end wood-burning stoves."

        {
          "headline":"Opt for a fireplace insert stove if your home has a fireplace.",
          "description":"Most wood stoves are freestanding, meaning that they can be located anywhere within your home. However, if your home already has a brick fireplace, consider purchasing an insert stove that can be installed directly inside of the existing fireplace. Insert stoves often work best in small homes or in situations where the only possible place to locate a stove is in the existing fireplace."

Emissions regulations for wood-burning stoves vary from state to state, so there\u2019s no single standard. Before purchasing a stove, make sure that it falls within the legal emissions limit for the area where you live. Contact your city or county government offices and ask for the local air pollution district office. Some counties are divided into more than 1 office.

Some large online retailers sell wood stoves. You can also purchase wood stoves directly from the manufacturer's site. Make sure to read up on the warranty before purchasing to make sure the company covers any damage to the stove that occurs while it's being shipped.
