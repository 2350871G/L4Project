        {
          "headline":"Score the fat.",
          "description":"Take a small, sharp paring knife and use it to score a crosshatch (diamond) pattern on the suck breast. Be very careful -- you only want to score the fat, not the meat underneath. This is easier if you hold the knife at an angle. Next, prick the duck all over with the point of the knife -- again, you only want to prick the skin, not the meat underneath. Doing this will allow more fat to escape from the skin and will produce a crispier roasted duck. Now, use the knife to remove any excess skin on either side of the cavity. You can discard this skin, or simmer it in water to remove the fat."

        {
          "headline":"Season and truss the duck.",
          "description":"Season the inside and outside of the duck with coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper. Truss the legs by crossing them and tying them with a piece of butcher's twine. Before you truss the legs, you can fill the cavity with a quartered onion or a quartered orange -- this helps to keep the duck moist and adds moisture. Cut off the tips of the wings at the final joint, then tuck the wings underneath the duck (just as you would when roasting a chicken)."

While you're waiting, spoon the duck fat from the bottom of the roasting tin. Be very careful doing this, as the fat is extremely hot and could cause a nasty burn. Once cooled, the duck fat will keep for several months in the fridge. It can be used to make delicious roast potatoes and veggies, or even to add flavor to a roast chicken! Once the oven reaches 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C), place the duck back in the oven, breast-side up and roast for 10 more minutes. This will help the skin to get really crisp."

Watch the duck carefully during this time, as you don't want it to burn! Instead of using a glaze, you can simply serve the roasted duck with a sauce on the side (recipes can be found below).
