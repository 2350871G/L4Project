Then you need to string a small piece of hard wire through the hole and connect the wire to the metal piece. Then glue together everything with a superglue or a two part epoxy for stronger hold."

If you're painting historical miniatures it could be a good idea to look at pictures or history books to get an idea of what that character would look like. If you're painting miniatures from a game, try searching on the internet for your character. This only applies if you want to paint the character as accurately as possible.
