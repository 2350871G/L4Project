          "description":"Nut shells have no nutritional value and cannot be consumed. Doing so could cause them to lodge in your throat, and you could choke. Therefore, always buy shelled nuts, or shell them yourself. In either case watch out for the occasional shell piece that might be left behind. If you shell nuts yourself, crack the nuts over a clean bowl or container to contain the mess of flaky shell bits. Discard of any shell bits after you\u2019re done."

          "headline":"Toast your nuts gently.",
          "description":"Toasting nuts in a dry skillet or in the oven can enhance the flavor. You could even toast nuts in the microwave. The length of time you spend toasting your nuts depends on how flavorful you want them. To toast nuts in the oven, lay them in a flat, even layer on a baking sheet. Set the oven to 325\u00b0 F (162\u00b0 C). Place the tray in the center rack for as long as wish your nuts to toast. To toast nuts in the microwave, place them in an even layer on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave them in one-minute intervals. Taste-test them after each minute-long round to see if they have attained the desired crunchiness and flavor. To toast nuts on the range, place them in a large frying pan over medium heat. Don\u2019t add any grease or oil. Stir the nuts frequently until fragrant and golden-brown in appearance. Different nuts require different toasting times to bring out their most delicious flavor. Almonds, for instance, require about 10 minutes in the oven. Peanuts, on the other hand, require closer to 20 minutes in the oven. Experiment with different toasting methods and times to identify how long you want your nuts toasted."

          "description":"Crusting fish or meat with nuts basically means coating the fish or meat with a layer of crushed or sliced nuts mixed with other ingredients. The oil in the nuts adds to the flavor of the meat and gives the final dish a pleasing crunch. For instance, to make a simple spicy cashew crust, blend 100 grams of crushed cashews, four mild red chilies, 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon of cumin powder, six large, peeled garlic cloves, and a thumb-sized piece of finely-chopped ginger. Pat a 140-gram fish fillet with paper towel until relatively dry. Take a handful of the cashew crust and press it into fish. Place the fish on an oiled baking tray, then bake in the oven at 375\u00b0 F (190\u00b0 C) for about 13 minutes."

For instance, if you dislike peanuts but love cashews, you can substitute cashews in most \u2013 if not all \u2013 cases with little difference. You can use chopped cashews or even almonds in pad Thai if you have a peanut allergy. You can also customize your recipes by adding nuts to recipes you already love.

Once the butter mixture is blended, stir in \u00bd a teaspoon of baking soda and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Pour the mixture into the larger mixing bowl containing the cereal and coconut mix. Stir everything together with a spatula. Once the dry ingredients are completely coated with the hot, bubbly mixture, scoop everything out and into two foil-lined baking pans measuring 15 inches by 10 inches (38.1 centimeters by 25.4 centimeters). Set your oven to 250\u00b0 F (121\u00b0 C). Place the pans in the oven for about 55 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes to mix the contents of each pan. Remove each pan when 55 minutes has elapsed and let each pan cool on top of the stove. Use your coconut cashew crunch as a topper for ice cream, fruit, or yogurt. Cooking With Almonds Make a beef and almond zucchini boat. A beef and almond zucchini boat is basically a zucchini sliced lengthwise with its innards scooped out and filled with beef, almonds, and a spicy seasoning. Kids and adults will love your almond zucchini boat. To begin, preheat your oven to 375\u00b0 F (190\u00b0 C). Toast 1/3 of a cup of slivered almonds for about three minutes, stirring occasionally. Cook one small onion in 1 tablespoon of olive oil for about three minutes. Then add two large, minced garlic cloves and stir for another minute. Finally, add \u00bd a pound of lean ground beef and stir in 1.5 teaspoons of coriander, \u00bd teaspoon of cinnamon, \u00bc teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Cook for one more minute. Add 2/3 cup of cooked bulgur wheat, 3 tablespoons of raisins, and 1 can (14.5 ounces) of drained, diced tomatoes. Cook for two more minutes, then add the toasted almonds. Slice two or three zucchinis lengthwise and scoop out the zucchini flesh with a melon baller or small spoon. Discard or consume the removed material. Fill the zucchini with the almond-beef mixture you just cooked. Place the zucchini boats on an oven tray and cover with foil. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for 10 more minutes. Remove and allow to cool. Consume the tasty zucchini boats with your friends. Use almond flour. Almond flour is perfect for deserts and baked goods. You could also incorporate it into pancakes or any other dish you want to lend a mild, nutty flavor. For instance, you could try an almond flour blueberry muffin. Pre-heat your oven to 350\u00b0 F (176\u00b0 C). Place 2 cups of almond flour, 1.5 teaspoons baking soda, \u00bc cup applesauce, \u00bc cup maple syrup, 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, a dash of salt, 2 tablespoons of coconut oil, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract into your food processor and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture out into a large mixing bowl and mix in the blueberries. Spray a muffin tin with a non-stick cooking spray. Scoop the batter into the recesses of the tin to a level that does not exceed the edge of each recess. Bake the muffins for 25 minutes. Remove and allow the muffins to cool before consuming. To make two cups of almond flour, soak two cups of almonds briefly, then remove and let them dry. Once dry, place one cup of almonds in your food processor and blend on high using the pulse feature. Remove the first batch, then add the second cup of almonds. Store your almond flour in a resealable container if you don\u2019t want to use it right away. Create a nut butter. Almond butter is great on toast, waffles, or pancakes. The best almond butter will have a hint of sweetness in addition to the savory nut flavor. To make 1.75 cups of almond butter, preheat your oven to 325\u00b0 F (162\u00b0 C), then toast 2.25 cups of almonds for 12 to 15 minutes in the oven. Let the almonds cool slightly, then dump them in your food processor and process them for about two minutes. The almonds should look dry, like almond flour. Add \u00be teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of safflower oil. Turn the processor back on for another minute. If you want a sweeter almond butter, you could also add 2 tablespoons of honey or maple syrup at this point. If you like cinnamon, you could also add \u00bd a teaspoon of cinnamon. You can refrigerate your nut butter for up to four weeks in an airtight container. Brew some almond milk. If you\u2019re lactose-intolerant or trying to cut down on your cholesterol, drinking almond milk instead of cow milk is a great way to go. You can easily make almond milk at home. To make about 3.5 cups of almond milk, soak one cup of almonds in a large bowl and fill the bowl with water to a level that covers the nuts by two inches. Leave the nuts in the bowl overnight, or for at least 12 hours. Drain the water from the bowl, then put your nuts, 1/8 teaspoon of salt, 4 teaspoons agave syrup, and 4 cups hot water (but not boiling water) into your blender. Blend on high for about two minutes. Strain the nut pulp from the liquid using a fine-mesh strainer. Simply place the strainer over a large bowl, then pour the blended mixture slowly into the bowl. Discard the nut pulp that accumulates on the strainer surface. If you don\u2019t want to make your own, almond milk is available at most grocery stores.",
