          "description":"Mindfulness is the art of being present in the moment. To be mindful, you will need to focus on what\u2019s happening around you, without giving into the temptation to distract yourself or multitask. If you want to have intuition like Sherlock Holmes, you need to optimize your thinking by practicing mindfulness. Focus on your breathing. Start by noticing when you breathe in and when you breathe out. You can even try using an app to help you with your breathing, such as Breathe or Pacifica. Pay attention to what you\u2019re doing, even in your daily routine. Notice the \u201ccrack\u201d of the eggshell breaking, taste the mint of your toothpaste, smell the rain as you walk to your car, feel the smoothness of your steering wheel, and see the leaves swirling across the parking lot. Immerse yourself in the moment. When your mind wanders, bring it back to the present."

          "description":"Your five senses help you process the world around you, so you want them to be working at their best. Like any other skill, practice using your senses of sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell so that you can use them to process the world around you. Using your senses, you can pick up clues to enhance your intuition just like Sherlock Holmes. Sharpen your hearing by listening to instrumental music on a low volume. Try to pick out the different sounds and pinpoint the different instruments. Improve your sense of smell by closing your eyes and focusing on a smell. Add to your practice by choosing smells to focus on, such as coffee or essential oils. Work on your sense of taste by eating pure, whole foods, concentrating on the flavor of the food. Enhance your sense of sight by adding vitamins to your diet, taking screen breaks, and getting natural light. You can also try eye exercises, such as rolling your eyes around and focusing on an object. Work on your sense of touch by making a point to describe the texture of objects you come into contact with. Compare and contrast different textures."

By examining your world, you develop your skills of observation. Start by gathering information about the environment and people you encounter every day. Be a passive observer. Try to make small predictions about what will happen, such as who will volunteer to speak when the group is asked a question. Confirm your predictions with evidence."

Choose a location like a park bench or a table in a coffee shop. Observe the people around you, cataloguing what you notice about each person. Ask yourself questions such as, \u201cWhat coffee will this person order?\u201d or \u201cWill this person act the same way with his friends as he was before they got here?\u201d\nPractice picking up on a person\u2019s personality or mood."

That\u2019s because he\u2019s practiced that skill. You can be just like Sherlock if you train yourself to notice details. Test your powers of observation by listing what you can remember about the places you\u2019ve been. For example, after you go to lunch at a local restaurant, list what you can remember about the place. What does the decor look like? What are the uniforms like? What dishes are on the menu? Next time you go to that restaurant, compare your list to see what you remembered correctly. Continue to test yourself to see how well you are noticing details."

Don\u2019t feel discouraged if you spend a lot of time in the same places because you can still challenge yourself to make new observations. Push yourself to focus on particular details. For example, you could decide to look for people who are wearing a red shirt or people carrying an umbrella. On your commute, try counting people who fit into a similar category. For example, if you ride the train you could count the number of people playing on their cell phones. At the doctor\u2019s office, you could track how many people read the magazines the office provides versus how many people bring items with them."

Active listening requires greater focus on what the other person is saying, as well as how they are saying it and the tone they are using. Cut out distractions so that you can really pay attention when people speak to you. For example, put away your phone and take a break from any tasks you were doing. Maintain eye contact with the person speaking to you. Focus on what the other person is saying, not on what you\u2019re going to say in response.

Play an active role in your life instead of sitting apart from others so that you can gain experience that will help you flex your intuition. Make a point to do an activity everyday, even if it\u2019s something small.

You may discover that the only person who makes coffee before 8 AM is the office accountant, Lily. Make generalizations using your evidence. According to this pattern, you can generalize that all coffee made before 8 AM is made by Lily. Based on this theory, if there is no coffee after 8 AM, then Lily has not come into work."

Look for relationships between causes and effects. For example, if your friend drinks more cups of coffee on Thursdays, then ask yourself what\u2019s different about that day. She may stay up late on Wednesday because she\u2019s taking a night class. Collect more information to determine if it\u2019s cause and effect or a correlation, which means that the two things are related but one is not causing the other. Be careful not to assume that a relationship between two things will be true in reverse. While a late class may cause your friend to drink more coffee the next day, that does not mean that every time your friend drinks a lot of coffee she has been to a night class."

Don\u2019t limit yourself in what you study. For example, knowing pop culture might not seem important, but it can help you understand the people around you, so it will help you better rely on your intuition. Try EdX.org, which offers classes from major institutions like Harvard, Berkeley, Georgetown, MIT, and other prestigious universities. You can take a class for free to learn from the world\u2019s best, or you can pay a small fee to get a certification that you took that course. Either way, it\u2019s a great opportunity to expand your knowledge. Check out sites like Meetup.com, which offer community-run groups. Some groups will connect you with people who can teach you new skills. For example, you may be able to learn how to build a website, cook Indian food, or combine essential oils."

For example, if everyone in the conference room has won a prize and Tom is in the conference room, then we know that Tom is a prizewinner. Build a theory. A master of deduction builds a theory upon evidence, which then allows them to draw solid conclusions based on their theories. Look for patterns in your life. Pay attention to the who, what, where, why, when, and how. For example, document who you see making the office coffee. You may discover that the only person who makes coffee before 8 AM is the office accountant, Lily. Make generalizations using your evidence. According to this pattern, you can generalize that all coffee made before 8 AM is made by Lily. Based on this theory, if there is no coffee after 8 AM, then Lily has not come into work. Test your theory. Once you\u2019ve built a theory based on generalizations, see if your theory holds true. In the example above, the next time 8 AM passes and there is no coffee, check to see if Lily is out of the office. Sharpen your problem solving skills. You need to improve your problem solving abilities so that you can use deduction to make better decisions. To use deduction, you need to be good at working out the solution to a problem. Start by defining your problem and understanding the facts. Gather and analyze information. List out possible solutions, and examine the qualities of each one. Think logically. You must learn to think logically if you are going to develop your intuition. For your intuition to be accurate, it needs to be trained to react based on logic. Look for relationships between causes and effects. For example, if your friend drinks more cups of coffee on Thursdays, then ask yourself what\u2019s different about that day. She may stay up late on Wednesday because she\u2019s taking a night class. Collect more information to determine if it\u2019s cause and effect or a correlation, which means that the two things are related but one is not causing the other. Be careful not to assume that a relationship between two things will be true in reverse. While a late class may cause your friend to drink more coffee the next day, that does not mean that every time your friend drinks a lot of coffee she has been to a night class. Expand your knowledge. To have strong intuition like Sherlock, you have to keep learning. Read books, watch documentaries, keep up with the news, and join groups that help you further your knowledge. You don\u2019t have to go to a formal school to learn something new. Don\u2019t limit yourself in what you study. For example, knowing pop culture might not seem important, but it can help you understand the people around you, so it will help you better rely on your intuition. Try EdX.org, which offers classes from major institutions like Harvard, Berkeley, Georgetown, MIT, and other prestigious universities. You can take a class for free to learn from the world\u2019s best, or you can pay a small fee to get a certification that you took that course. Either way, it\u2019s a great opportunity to expand your knowledge. Check out sites like Meetup.com, which offer community-run groups. Some groups will connect you with people who can teach you new skills. For example, you may be able to learn how to build a website, cook Indian food, or combine essential oils. Relax. Once you\u2019ve successfully trained your brain, you need to relax and give it time to work out the solution to the questions on your mind. Sherlock might relax by playing music, so take a note from him and turn on a relaxing playlist.",
