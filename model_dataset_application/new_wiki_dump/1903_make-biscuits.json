It's important not to overblend the mixture, since working the flour too much results in tough biscuits. Leaving tiny bean-sized pieces of butter will create pockets of buttery, flaky goodness in the finished biscuits. To determine whether the mixture has been blended enough, pinch a bit of dough between your thumb and forefinger. If the dough stays together, it's ready for the next stage. If it's still too powdery and crumbly to hold together, blend it a little more, then test it again."
