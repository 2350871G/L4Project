Depending on the area, the final frost may be anywhere from March to May. Check with forecasts in your area to tell when the final frost is expected, and start 6-8 weeks before that to give your seeds enough time to start growing. This means you\u2019ll probably have to start planting around February. Starting the seeds indoors is just one option for growing jalapenos. Alternatively, you could buy jalapeno seedlings from a nursery and transplant them into your soil. This avoids the weeks of prep work before the weather gets warm."

If you\u2019re planting many seeds, planting pods are a good choice to start the seeds in. Jalapenos prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH of 6.0-6.8. Test the soil and if the pH is above this level, acidify it with a nitrate fertilizer. Remember that each mature plant will produce 30-40 peppers per season. Use this as a judge for how many you should plant."
