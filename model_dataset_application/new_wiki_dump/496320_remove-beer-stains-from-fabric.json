In a quart of water, add a tablespoon of water and a 1/2 teaspoon of dishwashing detergent. Mix together, and add the piece of clothing. Let the clothing soak in the solution for about 15 minutes.

Start from the center of the stain and work your way outward, gently massaging it as you go. You may need to squeeze out the sponge and add more rubbing alcohol partway through. Don't rub too hard as that could damage the fabric. If the sponge gets too dirty, clean it off with soap and water before continuing."

Mix it together, and put the piece of clothing in, making sure it's all the way submerged in the solution. Let the clothing soak for half an hour. Once you've soaked it, pull it out and check to see if the stain is lifting. If it still seems solidly on there, you may want to soak it for longer. Enzyme cleaners are a natural way to  own stains.

One way to check the stain is to smell it. If it still smells like beer, wash it again. Also, look for discoloration. If the fabric is still discolored, you need to wash it again."

Measure out 2/3 a cup of rubbing alcohol. Add a tablespoon of white vinegar to it, and mix it together. The second solution uses dishwashing detergent and water. In 2 cups of cool water, add a tablespoon of dishwashing detergent. Stir it together. Either solution will work, so just choose one based on what you have on hand.
