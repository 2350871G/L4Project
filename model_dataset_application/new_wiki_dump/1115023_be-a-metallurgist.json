They analyse the structure and composition of metals and how they react to different processes, such as being placed under heavy weight. If you are interested in physics, then physical metallurgy could be a good choice for you. As a physical metallurgist, your job duties might include investigating accidents that could be due to metallurgical failure, running process and product development trials, and writing reports on tests and investigations."

They control the shaping processes of metals, such as casting, and join metals together by welding and soldering. Being a process metallurgist could be a good field for you if you want to physically produce usable metal parts. Physical metallurgists produce everything from small parts used in medical science, to huge parts used in construction. As a process metallurgist, your job duties could include interpreting design drawings, selecting the best metal to use, making recommendations about designs, and creating metal products to precise specifications."
