          "description":"Your air fryer requires a two to three minute preheating period. This allows the machine time to achieve the temperature necessary to begin cooking your bacon. For most models, simply set the air fryer to the desired temperature and wait  at least two minutes before adding your bacon to the air fryer\u2019s cooking basket. Operate your air fryer only on level, heat-resistant surfaces. Further, ensure that there is at least a hand\u2019s length worth of open space behind the air fryer\u2019s exhaust."

          "description":"You\u2019ll need to apply a thin coat of oil directly to the bacon you place in the air fryer\u2019s cooking basket. The best way to do so is by using a spray bottle filled with your favored cooking oil. Spray the bottom of the cooking basket as well, to reduce sticking, and spray. For crispy bacon, spray on only a single thin layer of oil. Opt for a hand-pumped plastic spray bottle and fill it with liquid oil, such as olive oil. While you can buy spray-able oil, the aerosol can break down some of the non-stick surfaces you use in your kitchen (including the one on your air fryer basket)."

          "description":"Avoid overcrowding the air fryer\u2019s cooking basket by limiting the amount you put in. Since basket sizes differ, there is no standard amount that is ideal. The important thing is that air is allowed to circulate around the bacon and come into contact with almost all of the bacon\u2019s surface. As such, avoid piles of bacon that cause some pieces to be covered up. Proper air circulation shortens cooking time and ensures optimal cooking results, particularly in terms of crispiness."

          "description":"While the air fryer is cooking your bacon, pause it once to twice to remove the basket and shake it. This will adjust the bacon\u2019s position in the basket, and help ensure that it is evenly cooked. To ensure that each piece if adequately adjusted during cooking, you can also use tongs to simply flip individual slices of bacon."

To prevent the grease from burning and making smoke, add a bit of water to the tray. This will help the grease cool. To minimize the amount of fat that drips from your bacon during cooking, dab individual pieces with paper towel before placing them in the cooking basket. Smoke from fat and grease is white. If there is ever black smoke coming from your air fryer, turn it off. Once the machine has cooled, look inside the heating element compartment and clear any food that has gotten into it."
