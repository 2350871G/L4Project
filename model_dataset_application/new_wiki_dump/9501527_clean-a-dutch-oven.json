You might need an abrasive scrub pad to remove pesky food residue, but the most important rule to follow is to avoid steel wool and other metallic pads or brushes. Steel wool, wire brushes, and other metallic scrubbers can erode the enamel coating. Go for nonmetal options, like nylon. A Scotch-Brite Dobie Pad is a great non-scratch choice for cleaning enamel cookware."

Use a ratio of 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of baking soda per 1 US quart (950 mL) of water.

Make a thick paste by mixing 2 or 3 spoonfuls of cleaner with hot water. Then, using plenty of elbow grease, scrub away the sticky bits. You can find cleaning powders like Bar Keepers Friend or Bon Ami wherever cleaning products are sold. Your local department store or major grocery chain should carry them."

For either, spray the product onto the problem areas, let it sit, scrub with a nonmetal pad, then thoroughly rinse away residue with hot water. If you prefer eco-friendly products, go for a biodegradable degreaser, such as De-Solv-It. If you use a non-toxic, biodegradable degreaser, you won\u2019t have to wear gloves. While not as powerful as heavy-duty cleaners, a non-toxic product should do the trick. Powerful, heavy-duty degreasers, such as Zep, will get just about anything off of your pot. However, they\u2019re toxic and are not environmentally friendly. Be sure to wear rubber kitchen gloves and work in a well-ventilated area."

Dilute 2 to 3 tablespoons (29.6 to 44.4 ml) of household cleaning ammonia with hot water at a 1 to 1 ratio. Scrub the problem spots, then rinse the pot thoroughly with hot water. Ammonia is an excellent degreaser, but it\u2019s harsh, toxic, and not eco-friendly. Wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated area. Never mix ammonia and bleach together, as they produce toxic fumes when combined."

If you want to get your enamel\u2019s hue good as new, soak it overnight in a solution of bleach and water. Wash the pot with soap and hot water thoroughly after soaking it in the bleach solution. Dutch oven manufacturers recommend mixing 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of bleach with 1 US pint (470 mL) of water. However, you can use a ratio as strong as 1 part bleach to 3 parts water. If only the bottom is stained, just use enough solution to cover the bottom. If the sides are discolored, fill the pot with enough solution to cover the stained area. Remember to keep bleach away from ammonia. If you degreased the pot with ammonia, rinse it thoroughly before adding a bleach solution."
