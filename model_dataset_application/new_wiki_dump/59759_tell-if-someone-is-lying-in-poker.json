          "description":"The common advice is to look someone in the eye to see if they are lying. This is not a tested strategy, however. Skilled players have no problems looking someone in the eye while bluffing. A new or unskilled player might glance away or dilate their pupils some when bluffing, but these are often stress responses. When a player learns to control the stress that comes with bluffing, these signals become easy to control."

          "description":"When a player is trying to bluff you, their natural instinct is to try to look intimidating to encourage you to fold your hand away. Intimidation tactics may include slamming down chips, talking loud, and staring you down. Staring at you directly in the eyes is often an indicator of a bluff. While there are a number of reasons another play may look you directly in the eyes, someone holding eye contact is often trying to keep focus on them and intimidate you."

          "headline":"Watch their shoulders.",
          "description":"Stress causes our shoulders to tense up. If you are observant, you may be able to see some of your opponents slightly crunch their shoulders upward and inward. If you see this, it usually means your opponent is scared or has a weak hand. One the other hand, when your opponent drops their shoulders, it usually means they missed their hand. An opponent in this situation will likely not bluff and is no longer a threat to you during that hand."

          "headline":"Observe their breathing.",
          "description":"When an opponent starts breathing heavily in a deep up and down motion, that is a good sign that something is deeply stressing them out. If your opponent has just made a huge bet and their breathing becomes deeper, chances are they are bluffing. Hyperventilation may also indicate a stressful situation. Shallow breaths and frequent inhalation may indicate that your opponent does not know what to do next or is nervous during a hand."

          "description":"One of the biggest indicators your opponent is bluffing is how your opponent bets. An opponent who normally raises pre-flop to five multiples of the blinds suddenly and  makes it 2x the blind instead. This is a major tell that they want you to call. If they make it 10x the blind, they wants you to fold. Take note of how aggressive your opponent bets when they have a good hand. If they are generally a more aggressive better overall, there\u2019s a chance that they will try to intimidate you out of your hand with strong betting patterns."

          "description":"When a quiet person at the game suddenly starts talking, it's time to pay attention. Introverted people often talk less because social interaction may stress them out. This means that if a quiet opponent is talking, they are likely relaxed. A relaxed opponent is likely not bluffing and may even have a strong hand. On the other hand, if a more social player suddenly gets quiet, they may be devoting most of their attention to their hand. Chances are that they have something good and need to think about how to play it."

Instead, this tell typically indicates newer players who have trouble holding in their emotions. Expect aces, sets, or other huge hands when someone bets with shaking hands. When you see shaking stop, that is a potential tell that your opponent is bluffing. This may be seen right after your opponent bets against you. Look for any signs that they are trying to control themselves. For people who shake or bob their legs unconsciously, a bluff may cause them to stop their movement in an attempt to control themselves and make it appear as though they have no tells."

This may come naturally due to lack of stress to bluff, or a player may try to put on a show to demonstrate their feigned lack of interest in their hand. Some intentionally passive gestures may include big sighs, slumping in their chairs, saying things like \"I guess I'll bet.\" or shaking their head.

An experienced player knows better than to smile when they get a good hand, but their eyes will often narrow somewhat. The best indicator of this is seeing crows feet suddenly appear around their eyes. Even if your opponent has their eyes covered, watch how the skin folds in the area around their eyes. The sudden emergence of fine lines may indicate that they are sincerely excited for their hand."
