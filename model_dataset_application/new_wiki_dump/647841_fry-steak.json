A griddle pan or skillet can also be used to cook a steak. A pan needs to get very hot to comfortably cook a steak. If you're cooking multiple steaks, and don't have a pan big enough to hold them all, do not squeeze all the steaks on the pan. Instead cook them one at a time."

If you salt the steak too soon before cooking, the salt will actually result in it ending up dryer. Salt the steak at least 40 minutes before you cook it, if not longer. If you have time, salting the steak a few days before you decide to cook it can give it a nice, juicy flavor."

If you use butter at all, it should only be used at the end of the cooking process to give your steak a creamy taste. Some people apply a coating of oil to the steak before cooking it. Other people prefer to add oil to the pan, heat it up, and then add the steak. Either method can effectively cook your steak. Choose whichever one you prefer. Just make sure the oil is coated evenly throughout the pan or steak."
