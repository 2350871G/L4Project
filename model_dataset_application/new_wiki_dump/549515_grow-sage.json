If you've never had sage before, you can either plant fresh sage seeds (which can be temperamental) or purchase a small plant from the garden center and transplant it into your garden or a clay pot. However, if you already have an established sage plant, you can use cuttings or layering techniques to grow a new plant."

If you're using clay soil, try mixing in some sand and organic matter. This lightens the soil and helps with drainage. Sage grows best when it is planted with other perennial herbs, such as thyme, oregano, marjoram and parsley."

If you are transferring a sage plant into the ground, then make sure to plant it at the same level as it was in the pot. If you decide to plant seeds, they should be planted in late spring (in a bed or in a container) about 1/8 inch deep and 24 to 30 inches apart. They will take 10 to 21 days to germinate."

But when they reach maturity, you should only water sage when the soil surrounding the plant is dry to the touch. In fact, in some climates you won't need to water your sage at all - they'll get all the moisture they need from rainfall. Sage is a tough little plant and is very drought-tolerant."

If sage is exposed to too much shade, it will grow leggy and flop over. So if you keep your sage plant in an indoor area without much sunlight, you can use fluorescent lights instead. Standard fluorescent lamps should be 2 - 4 inches above the plants. However, high output fluorescent, compact fluorescent, or high intensity discharge (metal halide or high pressure sodium) plant growing lights work better and, if used, should be placed 2\u20134 feet (0.6\u20131.2 m) about the plants."

You can either start again with a new plant or seed, or use the old plant for cuttings or layering. To layer the plant, bend a branch of the existing sage towards the soil. Use some wire to pin the branch to the ground, about 4 inches from the tip. After about four weeks, roots will begin to form. Then you can cut the branch and transplant the newly formed sage plant to another location. To use cuttings, cut the top 3 inches from the branch of an existing sage plant. Strip the lower leaves from the stem, or use a scissors to cut them off. Dip the ends in rooting hormone, then place in sterile sand. Wait 4 to 6 weeks for roots to form, then move to a pot and later the garden. It is best to take cuttings of plants in early spring, just after you notice some new growth."
