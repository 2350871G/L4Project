  "text":" Purchase Supplies Identify an area in your bathroom where you can hang the shelves and take measurements. The amount of room you have will dictate how much wood you will need to purchase. Buy wood to create the shelving. Visit the home improvement store and ask the lumber expert about types of wood that would be complimentary for your project, any types of wood on special and durability. Give the lumber expert your measurements and ask for advice on the amount if you are unsure how much wood you should purchase. Pick up wood stain or paint. These shelves can be either stained or painted depending on your personal style. Buy (or find) a jigsaw or electric saw, electric screwdriver, hammer (or nail gun), protective eyewear, nails and screws (1 \u00bc\u201d and 2 \u00bd\u201d).  Cut Lumber Create/cut the backboard according to your earlier measurements. Leave enough room on the board to place three spacers and shelves. Cut middle spacers and the shelves approximately 12\u201d long. This measurement is approximate and may vary based on the amount of room and size of your shelving. Consider cutting the bottom spacer slightly smaller than the rest for a decorative reveal (about 11\u201d).  Measure about 1\u201d from the backboard and mark guidelines for where you will nail spacers and shelves. You will want to start with the spacer, then shelf, spacer, then shelf, spacer and a shelf that should provide a slightly longer space at the bottom. Create Shelf Nail bottom spacer in place, leaving a 1\u201d reveal at the bottom edge. This will provide the basis for the rest of your shelf. Add the first shelf and nail it into place, by measuring 3 1/4\u201d from the edge of the backboard.  Work your way up to the top of the backboard until all spacers and shelves have been nailed and secured in place.  Reinforce and Mount the Shelf Drill two holes on the backside of the board using a countersink drill bit. Drill one hole at the top of the board and one at the bottom of each spacer. Drill two more holes spaced from 1\u201d from each side of the backboard into each shelf ledge.  Drive 1 \u00bc\u201d drywall screws into each hole on the board. This will reinforce and keep shelf sturdy. Stain or paint shelf and allow it to dry before mounting onto the wall. Consider two coats and possibly a clear top coat to protect the wood from moisture build up in the bathroom. Mount shelf on the wall using two 2 \u00bd\u201d screws placed on the top and bottom backside. ",
