Once softened, use the same towel to wipe the glue and any extra residue away."

          "description":"If the glue on the glass is a stronger type, you may have to use a cleaner specifically made to break down sticky or oily substances. The cleaning section at a nearby market or automotive shop should have these items in stock. These could be window or glass cleaners like Windex, or automotive cleaners like Goo-Gone or Goo Off. Wet a towel with the solvent, place it on the glue, and leave the towel there for a few moments to let the cleaner begin to break down the adhesive. Take the towel off and wipe away any remaining glue with a clean towel. Commercial-strength cleaners contain chemicals in order to break down residues. In order to use them safely, make sure to use the products in a well-ventilated area with the proper protective gear to cover skin and eyes."

This can be done most effectively by heating the glue up by pouring hot water onto it or blowing it with a hair dryer, or by soaking the glue with other chemical softeners like vinegar, cooking oil, or lighter fluid. If this works to soften the residue, then wipe it away using a clean towel."
