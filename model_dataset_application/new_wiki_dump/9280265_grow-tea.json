Some of the technical jargon can be overwhelming, but just remember this: opt for the sinensis variant and avoid the assamica. The assamica can be temperamental and requires a specific tropical climate. The sinensis variant is much more adaptable and easy to grow in a multitude of climates. The full technical name is Chinese Camellia sinensis sinensis. Get your seeds from a reputable source and confirm the variant with the seller before purchasing."

Once the seedlings have grown 3 or 4 leaves, they are ready to be transplanted. You can transplant them outdoors if your climate is relatively warm. Zones 7 through 9 are ideal, but these hardy plants can adapt as long as the winters aren't harsh. For colder climates, transplant them into bigger pots for greenhouse or indoor gardening."

Making Different Types of Tea Gently dry unopened buds to make white tea. White tea is a delicately-flavored tea that is made from the silvery-white unopened buds and immature leaves of the tea plant. Some varieties of white tea are made only from buds, without any leaves. Steam the leaves on the stove top for about 1 minute and then dry them in an oven for about 20 minutes at 250\u00b0 F (121\u00b0 C) immediately after harvesting. Brew immediately or store the dried leaves in an airtight container for later use. Brew freshly dried leaves to make green tea. Green tea is made from leaves that have been minimally processed. After harvesting, allow the leaves to wilt in the shade for a few hours, then steam them on the stovetop for about 1 minute. Dry the leaves in the oven for about 20 minutes at 250\u00b0 F (121\u00b0 C), then brew. You can also store the dried leaves in an airtight container and use them later. Wilt leaves in the sun and dry them in the shade to make oolong. After harvesting the leaves, allow them to sit in the sun for about 1 hour. Bring the wilted leaves inside or place them in a dry, shady spot for 10-24 hours. Gently mix or stir the drying leaves occasionally to aerate and gently bruise them. If you wish, you can either dry the leaves briefly in the oven (20 minutes at 250\u00b0 F/121\u00b0 C), or skip oven-drying and roll the leaves into small balls before brewing. Massage and air-dry leaves to make black tea. After harvesting the leaves, \u201cmassage\u201d them by rolling them between your fingers and hands. Do this until the leaves become darker in color. Spread out the bruised leaves on a flat surface and put them in a cool, dry place. Allow them to air-dry for 2-3 days. Complete the drying process by putting the leaves in the oven for 20 minutes at 250\u00b0 F (121\u00b0 C). Store the dried leaves in an airtight container.",
