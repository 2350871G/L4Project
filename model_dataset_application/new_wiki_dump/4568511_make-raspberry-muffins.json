Next, add in 1 \u00bc cup (approximately 296 g) sugar and beat with the butter until the two are thoroughly combined. If you don\u2019t have an electric mixer, you can beat the butter and sugar together by hand. It just may take a little longer to combine the two. Softened butter should feel cool to the touch, but your finger should leave an indentation if you apply slight pressure to it. To soften it, cut it into pieces and leave it out on the counter for approximately a half hour. You can also put in a microwave-safe bowl and heat it in the microwave at 10% power for 20 seconds. After the 20 seconds, check the butter to see if it needs additional time, and work in 5 second intervals."
