  "text":" Working the First Round Make a slipknot using the red yarn. Wrap the yarn around your index and middle fingers (held together) 2 times. Bring the first loop over the second loop. Keep the loop on your fingers and pull on the tail of the yarn to tighten the knot around the base of the loop. Transfer the slipknot onto your crochet hook and then tug on the tail to tighten it. Make sure that the slipknot is secure on the crochet hook, but not so tight that you cannot slide it back and forth easily.Tip: Red and black are common colors for poppies, but you may also go with orange and brown, pink and black, or another combination that you want to use! Chain 4. To create a chain, loop the yarn over your hook 1 time and pull this through the slipknot. Repeat this sequence 3 more times to create a total of 4 chain stitches. Do not count the slipknot as a chain. Slipstitch through the third loop from the hook to connect the ends. Insert the crochet hook into the third loop from the hook and then then loop the yarn over the hook 1 time. Pull this yarn through both loops on the hook to connect the chain in a circle. Keep in mind that a slipstitch will not add bulk to your work. It is just a flat stitch to move your yarn to where you want it to be. Chain 1 and single crochet 10 times into the center of the ring. To single crochet, insert the hook into the center of the circle, then loop the yarn over the hook 1 time. Pull the yarn through the first loop on the hook. Then, yarn over again and pull through 2. Do not work the single crochet stitches into a single chain stitch! Work them into the center of the circle you have formed with the chain. Slipstitch to connect the ends of the round. After you complete the last single crochet stitch, insert your hook into the first single crochet stitch in the round. Loop the yarn over the end of the hook, and then pull it through both loops to secure the ends of the round together. Don't skip the slipstitch or you will have a visible gap between the beginning and end of the round. Creating the Petals Start the second round with a chain of 2. Work the 2 chain stitches the same way you did before. Loop the yarn over the end of the hook, and pull through 1. This will create 1 chain. Repeat to make the second chain. Double crochet 2 times into each of the next 2 stitches. To double crochet, loop the yarn over the hook 1 time. Then, insert the hook into the first stitch and yarn over the hook again. Pull the yarn through 1 loop. Yarn over again, and pull through 2. Then, yarn over 1 more time and pull through 2 again to complete the stitch. Work 2 double crochet stitches into the same stitch space. Double crochet the next stitch in the same way. Work 3 triple crochet stitches into the third stitch in the round. To triple crochet, loop the yarn over the hook 2 times. Then, insert the hook into the stitch and yarn over the hook again. Pull this yarn through the first stitch on the hook, and then yarn over again. Pull through 2 loops, then yarn over again, and pull through 2 more. Yarn over 1 more time, and then pull through the last 2 stitches. Repeat this sequence 2 more times in the same stitch space. Double crochet 2 times into the fourth stitch. Work 2 double crochet stitches into the same stitch just as you did before. This will create a downward slope on the other side of the petal. Your petal should be noticeable by the time you complete the second double crochet stitch. Chain 2 and slipstitch into the fifth stitch to complete the first petal. Make a chain of 2 as you did before, and then insert the hook into the fifth stitch. Yarn over, and pull through both loops on the hook. This completes the first petal. Chain 2 and work 3 double crochet stitches into the sixth stitch. This will form a smaller petal beside your first one. Make sure to work all 3 of the double crochet stitches into the same stitch space. Keep in mind that the chain of 2 counts as a double crochet stitch, so it is almost like you are crocheting a cluster of 4 double crochet stitches. Repeat the first petal sequence to complete the round. The last petal will use the same sequence as the first petal, which is as follows:\nDouble crochet 2 times into the seventh stitch. Work 3 triple crochet stitches into the eighth stitch. Double crochet 3 times into the ninth stitch. Chain 2 and slipstitch into the last stitch to finish the round. Making the Center of the Poppy Make a magic circle using black yarn. A magic ring is a simple ring of yarn that you can tighten after working stitches into its center. This will create an attractive center for your poppy. Wrap the yarn around your index and middle finger 2 times, and then work a slipstitch around the edge of the circle to secure it. Insert the hook into the center of the circle, yarn over, pull the yarn through, yarn over again, and pull through 2. Single crochet 10 times into the center of the circle. Work 10 single crochet stitches into the center of the magic circle. Count as you crochet to ensure that you don't do too many. Don't worry if the stiches look loose or spaced out. You will bring them together after you finish the last stitch. Tighten the ring, slipstitch, and cut the yarn. Pull the tail of yarn to close the circle and bring the stitches together. Then, insert the hook through the first stitch in the round, yarn over, and pull through both loops on your hook. Cut the yarn about 4 in (10 cm) from the last stitch. Leaving a tail of yarn is important so that you have enough yarn to sew the black piece and also to tie the ends together behind the flower. Thread the yarn needle and position the black piece on the red piece. Grasp the end of the red tail of yarn that is extending from the center of your poppy. Insert the tail through the eye of your needle so that about 1 in (2.5 cm) of yarn is through the eye. Hold the needle at the eye to keep the yarn in place. Place the black piece at the center of the red piece and hold it there with your other thumb and forefinger. Make sure that you continue holding the needle at the eye as you sew to keep the yarn from coming loose. Sew the black piece onto the center of the red piece. Insert the needle into the center of the black piece and out through the back of the red piece. Repeat this 3 more times, then thread the other end of the black piece onto the needle and bring it through to the back of the poppy as well. Tie the ends together in a knot behind the poppy to secure them. Cut the excess yarn behind the poppy when you have finished attaching the center. Your poppy is finished! Secure it to your clothing with a safety pin or sew it onto a knit or crocheted item. Tip: You may also add a leaf to your poppy, if desired. Crochet a simple leaf using green yarn and sew it onto the back side of the poppy using the tail.",
