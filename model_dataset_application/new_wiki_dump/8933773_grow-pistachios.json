However, it\u2019s also possible to grow trees from seeds bought in a grocery store. If you do this, make sure they are not salted or roasted. Otherwise they won\u2019t germinate and will be useless for growing your own pistachios. You should be able to buy raw pistachios seeds from health food stores and some grocery stores. Keep in mind that pistachio trees are unisex (either male or female) and you won\u2019t know the sex until the tree is first supposed to bear fruit, seven to eight years into its life. Female pistachio trees are the only ones that will have fruit, but they need a male tree to fertilize them. As such, you should plant multiple trees to maximize your chances of having both female and male trees. If you purchase a grafted sapling or a cutting, you can determine the sex of your tree by the sex of the parent tree. They will be the same."

Once you\u2019ve put the seeds in, you should be ready to wait at least a week for the seeds to germinate.
