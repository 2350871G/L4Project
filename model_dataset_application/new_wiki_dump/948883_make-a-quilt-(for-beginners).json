          "description":"Different kinds of fabric wear differently over time -- so it's best not to blend. Sticking to cottons will probably be your best bet. What's more, think about color and scale -- not thinking it out may result in a quilt that seems flat and off-kilter. Stay in the same color family, but don't use the exact same shades -- your quilt will seem monochrome and dull. Think about lights and brights, bolds and darks, and avoid ones that are a bit matchy-matchy. Don't pick fabrics that are all small or large prints. A good variety of both will create a dynamic, vivid piece. You may want to pick one fabric and base the rest around that specific pattern. Consider having a \"zinger\" fabric. It's one that is significantly brighter than the rest and, as a result, makes the entire quilt pop. You'll also need fabric for the back, the border, binding, and the batting. If you stick to high-quality 100% cotton quilting fabrics that come from the independent shops or the higher-end selection at JoAnn, Hancock, etc., you should not have a problem with colors bleeding, etc. If the fabric is older or lower-quality, prewash before you start cutting."

Most kits are marked with level skills. Some are designed to fit the needs of unskilled beginners, usually for a wall hanging to start with before undertaking a full-size quilt.

A low-loft fabric is easier to work with, but will result in a thinner product. Fiber is what material your batting is made of. Polyester, 100% cotton, and a cotton/poly blend are your three most common options and none is necessarily better than the others. Wool and silk are also available, but they're a bit pricier. And a recent mover on the scene is bamboo, but that's just strange. Polyester - A cheap option that's better for hand-quilting if it's low-loft. It doesn't need to be quilted closely together, though it does tend to shift and the fibers can migrate to the edges of the quilt over time. Cotton - This is a good option for machine quilting. It should be quilted closely. It will shrink a bit, but it shouldn't pill. The 100% kind feels like flannel. Cotton blend (usually 80% cotton/20% polyester) - Probably the best option, if you had to pick. It's not super expensive and it doesn't shrink as much as the 100% kind.

Carefully pull the fabric taught (but don\u2019t stretch it) and tape it to a hard, flat surface. Smooth the batting and lay your quilt top over the batting.

Sew the binding to the back of the quilt with a \u00bc\u201d seam allowance. (If you have a walking-foot feature on your machine, use it here.) When you get to the corner, stop your seam about \u00bc\u201d away from the end of that side. Lift the presser foot and rotate the quilt in the new direction, putting the triangle flap the other direction start sewing from the beginning of that side. When all four sides are sewn to the back of the quilt, fold the folded edge of the binding to the front of the quilt and pin in place. Mitered corners should fall into place. It\u2019s like magic. Pin abundantly to keep the binding in place in preparation for machine sewing. Using either a matching thread or an invisible thread (good if you don\u2019t want your stitching showing as much on the back of the quilt), carefully stitch the binding down working from the front of the quilt. Carefully pivot the needle when you get to the corners and continue sewing all the way around the quilt. You may want to back-stitch at the start and finish.",
