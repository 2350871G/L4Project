You\u2019ll not only learn all of the bartending basics, but you\u2019ll get to practice mixing and pouring drinks with a trained bartender too. At some bars, having attended a bartending school may make up for a lack of professional experience. Some bartending schools have job placement programs that can help you land a job after you complete your training. Keep in mind that bartending school can be fairly expensive, so you\u2019ll have to decide whether it\u2019s worth the investment. Some bartenders advise against going to bartending school since their certification is not required."

You don\u2019t want to sit in a bar without ordering anything, so look for an establishment that serves food.
