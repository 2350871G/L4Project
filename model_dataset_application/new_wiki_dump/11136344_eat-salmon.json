          "headline":"Cook salmon under a broiler for fast caramelized flavor.",
          "description":"Marinate a salmon fillet in your favorite flavorful ingredients while you preheat a broiler to high. Lay the fish on a baking sheet and place it about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) below the broiler. Cook the fish for about 6 minutes and then spoon some of the marinade over the top. Broil the fish for another 2 minutes so the salmon chars a little. If you'd like your fish cooked more, continue to broil it for 1-minute increments until it's as cooked as you like."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Toss salmon on the grill to give it a smoky flavor.",
          "description":"Heat a charcoal grill to high and oil the grate so the fish doesn't stick to it. Lay the fish on the grate flesh-side down and cover the grill. Cook the salmon for 1 to 3 minutes before you flip it over. Then, cover and cook the salmon for another 2 to 5 minutes. Although the USDA recommends cooking salmon until it reaches 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C), you might prefer to cook it less so it stays tender. If you want to use a gas grill, add wood chips to a smoker basket in order to lightly smoke the fish."

          "headline":"Simmer salmon in white wine for a delicate flavor.",
          "description":"To poach salmon fillets, pour about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of white wine into a skillet and heat it over medium. Add 1 sliced onion to the simmering wine and lay the salmon fillets on top. Then, put the lid on the skillet and cook the salmon for 5 to 10 minutes or until they flake in the center when you drag a fork across. To add extra flavor, lay fresh herbs, such as parsley or dill, in the skillet before you add the salmon."

          "description":"To cook 1 or 2 salmon steaks quickly, heat 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 44 ml) of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, lay the steaks in the pan so the skin faces down. Cook the salmon for 5 to 7 minutes without turning it so the skin becomes crispy and doesn't stick. Then, flip the fish over and cook it for 15 seconds so it sears on the top. Serve the crispy salmon steaks immediately so the skin doesn't begin to soften."

Season the salmon however you like and drizzle a little extra-virgin olive oil over the fish. Bake the fish for about 30 minutes or until it flakes a little in the center.Tip: To season the salmon, scatter thinly sliced lemons or oranges around the fillet along with 1 thinly sliced fennel bulb or onion. If you like a little heat, slice a chili pepper and place it around the fish. If you're serving salmon to a group, consider roasting a whole salmon instead of individual fillets."
