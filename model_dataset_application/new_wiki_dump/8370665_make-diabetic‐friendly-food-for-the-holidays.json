Select foods that will be safe for someone with diabetes. When choosing meats, go for leaner cuts whenever possible. Avoid cooking with red meat. Avoid processed foods, like deli meat. Go for lots of non-starchy vegetables, such as asparagus, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, greens (collard, kale, mustard, turnip), mushrooms, and squash (cushaw, summer, crookneck, spaghetti, zucchini). These foods are low in carbohydrates and you can eat about two cups raw or one cup cooked and not have to count the carbohydrates."

Go for non-stick pans to limit your use of butter and oil when cooking. In general, cooking spray, canola oil, and olive oil are better options than butter when cooking. Avoid frying whenever possible. Grilling, broiling, or baking are better options. Trim fat off of meats before cooking."

Substitute skim milk for whole or 2% milk. Look for fat-free dairy options whenever possible. If a recipe calls for eggs, see if you can find an egg substitute."

Add your onions to the pan and saut\u00e9 them for about 10 minutes. They should be softened slightly when they're done. Then, add your parsnips and saut\u00e9 them as well. To lower the carb count of this recipe, you could leave out the parsnips or substitute another vegetable. Parsnips have about 21 net carbs per serving. Try subbing cauliflower, which has only 5 grams of carbohydrate per cup."

This recipe serves four people. One serving contains about 400 calories, 15 grams of fat, and 27 carbohydrates. However, if you substituted cauliflower for the parsnips or just left out the parsnips, then that cuts the carbs down by about half."

You can also use an immersion blender, food processor, or just a regular blender to make your rutabaga and carrot mash into a puree.
