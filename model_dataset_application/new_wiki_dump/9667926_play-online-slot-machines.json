      "description":"Despite the seeming variety, the general rules of every slot are the same. Almost every slot has reels, symbols, and paylines. Advanced video slots also have special symbols, like wilds and scatters, that enhance your gameplay, activate special features like bonus rounds and free spins, and grant extra winnings. Here\u2019s a short glossary:\nReel - a vertical line where symbols are located. Usually there are 3-5 reels in a slot, and each reel fits 3-5 symbols. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/d9\\/1_1Reel.jpg\\/460px-1_1Reel.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/d\\/d9\\/1_1Reel.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nSymbol - basically, any image that is used to create a winning combination along the payline. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/41\\/1_2Symbol.jpg\\/460px-1_2Symbol.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/4\\/41\\/1_2Symbol.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nPayline - a virtual line that goes across the reels, usually from left to right. A win occurs when you get a certain number of matching symbols on an active payline as indicated in the game\u2019s help screen. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/0\\/0b\\/1_3Paylines.jpg\\/460px-1_3Paylines.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/0\\/0b\\/1_3Paylines.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nWild symbol - a so-called Joker in slots that substitutes other symbols to create a winning combination.

The special thing about it is that it doesn\u2019t have to appear on an  active payline to trigger a win. It may be \u201cscattered\u201d across the reels.

It may be a simple \u201cpick one of the three chests\u201d game, where your pick determines the win amount, a complex multilevel videogame-like experience with shooting aliens, or anything in-between. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3b\\/1_6BonusRound.jpg\\/460px-1_6BonusRound.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/3\\/3b\\/1_6BonusRound.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>Image by: Uploader<br>\\nLicense: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nFree spins - another form of a bonus, where you get a number of spins that don\u2019t reduce your balance.

RTP - stands for Return to Player. This is a theoretical percentage a game gives back to players in the long term. For example, if the RTP of a slot is 97%, it means that for every \u20ac100 wagered it returns \u20ac97 as payouts, keeping \u20ac3 in the casino. Note that this number doesn\u2019t necessarily apply to your particular gaming session, but rather to billions of spins made by all players in total in the lifespan of the game. You may win \u20ac1000, and it would mean that a hundred other players lost \u20ac10 each. The opposite is also true. Good casinos usually publish this information somewhere on the website. Some slots also have this information available in the game rules. Variance - this is basically how often a slots pays out. Low variance slots pay smaller winnings often. High variance slots are the opposite: you may not get any wins for a while, but when the win comes - it\u2019s big. This may result in the same overall RTP, so it\u2019s just a matter of personal preference."

This way you\u2019ll save your money for withdrawal or for the next gaming session."
