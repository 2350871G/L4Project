          "description":"Shooting sports photos requires a more versatile camera than still frame or simpler photography. DSLR cameras present clearer images through the viewfinder than other digital cameras. They have a wider range of settings that are designed with professional or skilled photographers in mind. Expect to pay at least $500 or so for an average quality camera. Higher quality cameras and lenses can run you multiple thousands of dollars."

          "headline":"Select a prime or zoom lens.",
          "description":"The particular lens that you choose is about personal preference. Choose a prime lens for a sharper zoom, which gives you clearer images even when the lighting is not great. Pick a zoom lens for greater range flexibility if the things you're shooting will be constantly moving closer or further from you. One drawback to a prime lens is that it's distance range is lower, so you have to move around a lot more to get good shots. One drawback to a zooms lens is that as you adjust the zoom length, you may lose the sharpness of the image."

          "headline":"Protect your gear from the elements.",
          "description":"Whenever you are shooting outside, carry your equipment in a bag to make it easy to transport and keep it safe in case of rain. A fanny pack works well for extra film, batteries, or small lenses. A shoulder bag or backpack can carry your camera and larger lenses. Also look for hoods or covers that allow you to keep shooting in the rain without ruining your camera."

          "headline":"Adjust the ISO setting depending on the available light.",
          "description":"Pay attention to the light available to you and raise the ISO number as needed. Each camera has different options, so the exact setting will vary. Things that affect the lighting are being indoors or outdoors and how much sun is shining. When shooting at night, a setting of 1600 is good. ISO is important for indoor sports too as the lighting is not always high enough. You won't need to set the ISO as high as night shoots, but higher than sunny day shoots. You may need to change the setting at different points during the sports event if the lighting changes. Evening games that go into the night will pose particularly obvious lighting changes."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Widen your aperture.",
          "description":"Setting your aperture to one of the lowest possible numbers means that it will open wider. This allows more light in, which is helpful for most sports shots. A wide aperture also tends to blur things in the distant background, which sharpens the focus on what you're shooting. Test this setting before the game starts to see how low you can go and still get quality shots."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a high shutter speed.",
          "description":"Sports photography seeks to capture quick movements in a still frame, so a faster shutter speed helps you get a crisp shot. 1/500 of a second is fast enough for most sports, but experiment with the highest speed your camera allows. Many cameras have a 1/1000 of a second speed. Remember that the shutter is only open for a fraction of a second, so it can't let in much light. This is why increased ISO and aperture settings are helpful."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Turn on your camera's burst mode setting.",
          "description":"High speed action means a great shot may pass before your lens in the time it takes to press a button. Burst mode takes 4-6 pictures with each click, so you increase your chance of catching the perfect shot. Keep in mind that this setting means your camera automatically takes extra pictures, so you have to wait until it's done. This will also fill your memory card up faster, so you may run out of space earlier. Plan ahead and have a second memory card, or a larger capacity memory card."

          "description":"If you are able to be down close to the action, get to the event ahead of time and find the spots where you'll have the best view of the playing area. Try to find a place where you can move around, crouch, and maybe even lay down. You want to pick a safe place where you won't end up getting hit by the players. The coaches, officials, or other game authorities may restrict where you can stand, which is important to find out ahead of time as well. If there are going to be other photographers at the game, getting there early will ensure you don't lose a great spot to someone else. Go to more sports games to take pictures, even if you don't have a specific reason for being there. You'll get practice but the stakes are lower."

          "headline":"Anticipate upcoming moments of action.",
          "description":"Great shots pass in a moment, so always be looking ahead of the action to where the action is moving. Learn the game well so you can tell when big plays are about to happen. You won't have time to react if a great shot reveals itself, so always be ready. For example, when shooting a football game, watch for the quarterback to cock the football back as he prepares to pass. Or in baseball, watch as a runner nears second base as he may be about to slide. If you have kids, take photos of them playing in the yard, watching for specific moments of action that would make good photos."

        {
          "headline":"Include surroundings in your shots.",
          "description":"Don't focus all of your attention on close-ups of the players, because the game is more than that. Catch photos of the coaches on the sidelines or the crowd reacting to a big play. Take wide shots that show the pitcher's reaction to a home run hit. All of the extras add drama to the shot. In between plays is a great time to get shots of the packed stadium, the many players on the sidelines, or the players on the field when they are resting. Don't ignore a shot just because it isn't action packed. Sometimes when you take an up close photo of a player, you lose the context of what is happening around them."

Every time you take your eyes from the action to your camera, you potentially miss a great photo opportunity. Only check your photos when the action is stopped, or wait until the game is totally over. Once you take a shot, the moment has passed anyway. You either got a great shot or you didn't, and checking your photo immediately won't change that. Looking away from the action also poses a potential safety risk because you won't see a ball or player coming at you. Keeping your eyes on the action keeps you safer."

Learn to be critical of your shots and pick out specific ways that you could have improved each one of them. Do your best to implement your self criticism the next time you take photos. Thinking that all of your shots are perfect leaves you no room to grow as a photographer. Don't be afraid to be overly critical so that you can find your weaknesses and improve them."
