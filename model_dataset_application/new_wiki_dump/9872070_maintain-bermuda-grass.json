These mowers cut the blades of grass vertically in a scissor-like movement as opposed to a regular rotary mower that cuts horizontally. Reel mowers allow the blade to be set closer to the ground than traditional mowers, which prevent the mower from scalping the grass. While reel mowers are a more expensive option than a traditional mower, a reel mower will allow you to get a closer cut."

          "description":"Early in the grass growing season (April-May), set the blade height to 1 inch (2.5 cm). During summer months (June-August) raise the blade to 1.5 in (3.8 cm). After the growing season is over (September-October), set the blade to 2 in (5.1 cm). During the fall (October-November), when the grass is dormant, you only need to mow on rare occasions. To prevent putting stress on the grass, do not take off more than one-third of the total height."
