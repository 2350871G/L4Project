The size of a kiwi plays no role in how ripe it is. To ripen your kiwis faster, place them inside a paper bag. Slice off each kiwi\u2019s stem. A kiwi\u2019s stem is located on the top of the fruit and typically looks like a small wooden patch. With a paring knife, cut off the stem and the immediate skin surrounding it, revealing the fruit inside.

Whole kiwis often swell and tear apart during the freezing process, a problem kiwi slices don\u2019t have. Preparing the Freezer Tray Cover a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper. Pull out a flat tray or baking sheet that\u2019s small enough to fit inside your freezer. Clean off the tray if necessary, then line it with a piece of parchment paper or non-stick plastic wrap. Look for parchment paper at discount and grocery stores. Place your kiwi slices on the sheet. The individual slices should not touch each other, but you can set them incredibly close to preserve space. If necessary, pull out additional baking sheets to store all your fruit slices.

Storing Your Kiwi Clear out a spot in your freezer that is large enough to fit your baking tray. Try to make this spot as flat as possible to keep your kiwi slices from losing juice or sliding into each other. Place your kiwis in the freezer until they are completely frozen. For small kiwi slices, expect the freezing process to take between 4 and 6 hours. For larger slices, it may take up to a day or, in some cases, even longer. Remove the tray when the kiwis are firm and no longer depress when squeezed. To speed up the freezing process, remove as many items from your freezer as possible.
