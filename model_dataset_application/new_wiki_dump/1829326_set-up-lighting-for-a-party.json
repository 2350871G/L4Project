          "description":"Candles don\u2019t cast much light, but that makes them perfect for smaller events like dinner parties. Place them on tables and other areas where people tend to gather. Since candlelight is dim, position candles close to your guests. However, keep them away from spots with a lot of activity to prevent them from falling over or getting blown out. If you\u2019re choosing regular candles, pick unscented ones to avoid irritating your guests. Place them in sturdy, enclosed holders to guard against fires in case someone bumps one over. Look for LED candles for better light control. Many offer unique features like colored lighting or even remote control. Since they don\u2019t have actual flames, you don\u2019t have to worry about activating the smoke detector during an indoor party. Another option is to hang up a candle chandelier for an impressive way to decorate your home when you host a formal event."

          "description":"Lamps are generally pretty bulky and cast a lot of light, so they have to be placed strategically. Since you probably have lamps at home, they are an easy source of lighting to use indoors. Fortunately, there are ways you can reduce bright lighting, such as by using dimmer bulbs and switches. To make lamps work for a more formal event, try using decorate lampshades. If you\u2019re looking for a unique lighting system, install low-watt bulbs in your lamps and put them where people eat and gather. Save your brightest bulbs to set up lighting away from the main party area. Take stock of the available electrical outlets and think about where you\u2019re going to hide cords so they don\u2019t pose a tripping hazard to your guests. Lamps are better for indoor parties than outdoor ones. If lamps are too bright or impossible to set up, try placing lanterns in areas you expect your guests to frequent."

          "description":"String lights come in a variety of styles, so they can add a lot of style and atmosphere to your party. They are most commonly used for informal events outdoors where everyone can sit under the lights, though they work well as a decoration at all sorts of parties. However, you will need to string the lights across buildings, fences, and tree branches. Plug the lights into the nearest outlet or get battery-controlled ones for more options. String lights can be hung up indoors if you have room for them. Use them to add color to your most informal celebrations. For a vintage vibe, go with Edison-style string lights. Try looking for fairy lights if you need something smaller and more decorative. Another option is to repurpose Christmas lights. Get some strands of LED bulbs that add style without overwhelming guests like traditional party LEDs tend to do."

Many LED lights are remote-controlled and may even have built-in speakers if you plan on playing music. You can choose the color setting you wish to display. LED lights aren\u2019t as bright as regular incandescent bulbs, but their coloring can make them irritating for some people.

Outdoor fires are great for friendly gatherings while indoor ones can make a simple party feel a little more formal. Fires work best in the evening on cooler days, but keep in mind how close you have to get to a fire in order to benefit from its light. Also, factor in the smoke and what you need to do to keep the fire burning. Fires have a limited range when used for lighting. Unless your party is centered around the fire, you may need to set up additional sources of illumination. Fires can be dangerous if you and your guests aren\u2019t careful around them. Take proper safety precautions, such as by keeping it away from flammable items."

They are portable like candles and offer more light, but you also have to be careful about how you use them. Refill the lantern as it runs out of fuel. If you\u2019re not planning on dealing with kerosene or another fuel source, try using battery-powered lanterns. Oil lanterns are meant to be used outdoors. Switch to harmless battery lanterns for indoor use."

Plant the torches in the ground, fuel them with citronella oil, then light them up when you\u2019re ready to use them. You can find different styles of torches if you\u2019re looking to create a theme for your party. Torches aren\u2019t hard to use, but you do need to take time planting them in your yard. Keep them away from flammable objects and have something absorbent on hand to clean up spilled oil."

Try creating some paper lanterns by folding up a piece of paper and dropping a tea light into it. You could also pour wax or oil into a glass jar. These small crafts are good stand-ins for regular, boring candles. They can add a little bit of illumination in dark settings. Custom lighting is often cheaper than renting or installing new light sources.

Space your lights out and point them away from where your guests are going to be. Stick to dimmer sources of illumination when you need to put lights close to your guests.

Make it as unobtrusive as possible and dim enough to maintain the same atmosphere as the rest of your party. Unless your party is unusually bright, expect to need some smaller light sources. Every table needs its own illumination. For outdoor parties, keep candles or lanterns on tables unless you have overhead lighting, a fire, or torches nearby. Adding centerpieces often helps when dealing with low lighting in the evening. Add style to a party by buying or making your own centerpieces.

Low-watt bulbs emit a much softer glow that sets a gentle tone perfect for most parties. Purchase some party bulbs, checking the packaging for the wattage to ensure you get what you need. Keep in mind that LED and CFL bulbs put out less light than incandescent bulbs. LED and incandescent bulbs will be even dimmer than incandescent bulbs of the same wattage.

Set up your strongest light sources to draw attention to important spots where guests need to be able to see clearly. Keep the lights near the edges of your party space so they don\u2019t get overwhelming. When they are placed further away than dimmer lights, they add some illumination while also giving guests a place to go when they leave. For example, put bright lamps or spotlights near food tables, The lights show new guests all the delicious food you have prepared for them. When they head to the table, they will be able to see what they\u2019re eating. For outdoor parties, add extra lanterns or torches as needed. You could keep food indoors or move it to the brightest part of your yard, for instance. Some other good places to put brighter lights include near the bathroom, the hallway, and the entryway."

Set the disco ball in the middle of a party area so people are either under it or far enough away that the light doesn\u2019t bother them. Position strobes on the outer edges of the area, pointing them at a wall or ceiling. These kinds of lights work well in areas with a lot of activity, such as a dance floor.

Small uplights placed in the right spot make visible shadows that lend an interesting effect to your party. It\u2019s a clever way to improve the atmosphere by creating interesting shadows and highlighting decorations. The lights also turn objects into focal points. Put a light behind your favorite piece of art, for instance, and every guest will look at it as they walk by. Hiding bright lights behind objects like tables can be very helpful for outdoor parties.

If you\u2019re going for something formal, then you probably don\u2019t need lots of colors. It\u2019s the opposite if you\u2019re going for an informal party. Get colored bulbs and LED lights or put your candles in colored shades. Pick which colors you want to display. Orange and green work well for a Holiday-themed party, for example. If you\u2019re throwing a basic house party, try hanging some simple string lights. Use Christmas lights to add a little color. Fancy lamps and candles are enough for formal parties, so set the tone through other methods like lighting placement. Install low-watt bulbs in any electrical lights. The regular bulbs you use in your home are going to be too bright for most parties. Try switching them with 40-watt bulbs. Low-watt bulbs emit a much softer glow that sets a gentle tone perfect for most parties. Purchase some party bulbs, checking the packaging for the wattage to ensure you get what you need. Keep in mind that LED and CFL bulbs put out less light than incandescent bulbs. LED and incandescent bulbs will be even dimmer than incandescent bulbs of the same wattage. Test the light bulbs before the party begins. Make sure they give off enough light for you to see, but not enough to distract from the party. Use bright lights to illuminate or direct guests at the party. The low lighting at a party makes navigating a little tricky sometimes. Set up your strongest light sources to draw attention to important spots where guests need to be able to see clearly. Keep the lights near the edges of your party space so they don\u2019t get overwhelming. When they are placed further away than dimmer lights, they add some illumination while also giving guests a place to go when they leave. For example, put bright lamps or spotlights near food tables, The lights show new guests all the delicious food you have prepared for them. When they head to the table, they will be able to see what they\u2019re eating. For outdoor parties, add extra lanterns or torches as needed. You could keep food indoors or move it to the brightest part of your yard, for instance. Some other good places to put brighter lights include near the bathroom, the hallway, and the entryway. Install dimmer switches in order to set the lighting at the perfect level. Buy some plug-in dimmer switches to control the output from electric light sources. After connecting the light source to the dimmer, plug the dimmer into an outlet. Use the slider on the dimmer to gradually raise or lower the amount of light in the room. If your party is indoors, also consider installing a dimmer switch on the wall. Remove the old light switch, then plug the wires into the dimmer. You will be able to set your home\u2019s lights to a more party-appropriate level. Use strobes and other dance lights to make a party less stuffy. Strobes, disco balls, and similar lighting options are common at dances. Use them to get people moving, but don\u2019t point them directly at your guests. Set the disco ball in the middle of a party area so people are either under it or far enough away that the light doesn\u2019t bother them. Position strobes on the outer edges of the area, pointing them at a wall or ceiling. These kinds of lights work well in areas with a lot of activity, such as a dance floor. You don\u2019t need them around dining areas and spots where people go to relax. Position lights behind objects to create shade. Try using objects like plants or big pieces of furniture as blockers for bright lights. Small uplights placed in the right spot make visible shadows that lend an interesting effect to your party. It\u2019s a clever way to improve the atmosphere by creating interesting shadows and highlighting decorations. The lights also turn objects into focal points. Put a light behind your favorite piece of art, for instance, and every guest will look at it as they walk by. Hiding bright lights behind objects like tables can be very helpful for outdoor parties. Put a lamp behind a table or set up your party behind a tree that will block out the brightness. Disable bright lights in other rooms that are close to the party. The light from these rooms could end up blinding your guests. Electric bulbs are the most common culprit, so remove them or flip the circuit breaker to deactivate them. You still need some illumination there if you expect the guests to use the room. Put candles or dimmer light bulbs there instead. For example, the light from a nearby bathroom can often be disruptive. If it\u2019s close to the main party area, set a candle out to direct your guests there.",
