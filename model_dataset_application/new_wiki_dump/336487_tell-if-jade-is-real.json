          "description":"Examine the stone's color to make sure it appears rich and vibrant. In most cases, it won\u2019t be purely opaque or purely transparent. Because it\u2019s a combination of opaque and transparent, look for a shine that's similar to light reflecting off water. If the color is dull or flat, it\u2019s likely a fake stone. Jade can sometimes be totally opaque, but the opaque stones aren\u2019t very valuable. If it looks like there are air bubbles in the stone, then it\u2019s likely not real.Tip: Real jade is rated A, B, or C based on how it\u2019s been treated to achieve the color of the stone. Type A means a stone is natural, untreated jade that may have a wax coating to enhance its color. Type B  is chemically bleached to remove impurities, then injected with a polymer to strengthen it. Finally, type C is chemically bleached and dyed to enhance its color, so it may fade or discolor over time."

          "description":"You should notice some color variations throughout the stone if the jade is real. These are likely to be consistent, meaning that you will notice the same patterns throughout the stone. On the other hand, fake jade may have perfect coloration or could have uneven consistency, meaning that it looks blotchy in spots. It may help to examine the jade directly under a light so that you can view it better.
