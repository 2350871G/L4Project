Move the sliding scale until the larger jaws of the caliper are fully pressed against each other. Compare the 0 positions on the sliding scale and the fixed scale, which is engraved on the caliper body. If the two 0 marks are lined up exactly, skip ahead to reading the measurement. Otherwise, continue to the next step to correct the error. Use an adjustment wheel if present. While this is not common, some vernier calipers have an adjustment wheel on the sliding scale, which can be pushed to adjust the sliding scale without affecting the caliper jaws. If your model has this wheel, push it until the zeroes on the sliding scale and fixed scale line up, then skip ahead to reading the measurement. Otherwise, continue to the next step. Watch the jaws closely to make sure you are not pushing a fine adjustment screw, which opens and closes the jaws by small amounts. Calculate a positive zero error. If the sliding scale's 0 is to the right of the fixed scale's 0, read the measurement on the fixed scale that lines up with the sliding scale's 0. This is a positive zero error, so write this down with a + sign. For example, if the sliding scale's 0 is at 0.9mm on the fixed scale, write down \"zero error: +0.9 mm.\" Calculate a negative zero error.
