Once the hull splits, you\u2019ll be able to see the in-shell almond inside. Almonds in the U.S. most commonly come from California and harvesting will take place from early August to late September. In southern hemisphere locations, such as Australia, harvesting is done between February and April. The almond tree goes from dormancy during the winter months, to blossoming (flowers on the tree), to maturing of the nuts (this is when the flowers fall off and fuzzy gray fruit begins to grow), to fully mature nuts on the tree, and finally to hull-split. Then, you can harvest the nuts. The hull of the almond has a thick, leathery, green-gray coat with a fuzzy exterior (like a peach). Inside of the hull is a wood-like shell, and inside of that shell is where you find the actual nut, or kernel, that you eat. When a hull has split open, you will see the shell inside, and the brown shell should be starting to split open, too. This crack indicates the almond is ripe."

Instead of picking hundreds of nuts off the ground, you\u2019ll be able to pick up your tarp, thus saving you a lot of time. The tarp also helps protect the nuts from ants or other insects that might try to crawl inside the hull."

The nice thing about almonds is that you don\u2019t have to pick them individually from the tree. Rubber mallets are used for harvesting many different kinds of nuts and can be purchased online or at a local garden supply store. If you don\u2019t have a rubber mallet, you could also use a broom handle or a long plastic pole. Make sure to wear protective eyewear and a hard hat! The nuts will follow the mallet down toward you, so you want to protect your eyes and your head. There will also be a lot of dust floating around from the hulls, so keeping the debris out of your eyes is important."
