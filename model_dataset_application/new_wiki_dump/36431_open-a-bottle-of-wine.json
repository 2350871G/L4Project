If the cork isn\u2019t quite free of the bottle yet, give the corkscrew a few wiggles and twists, then pull upward to finish removing the cork. If it still isn\u2019t free, twist the screw back down into the cork until the wings are halfway extended, then repeat the process."

If the cork doesn't lift out of the bottle, screw the corkscrew in deeper, lift the cork using the lever arm, and try pulling on the handle again. In fine restaurants, sommeliers often remove the corkscrew while the cork is still about halfway in the bottle, then finish removing the cork by hand.

Even though the screw should never actually contact the wine, wash it off with soap and water. If you want to clean the screw more completely after washing it off, disinfect it by soaking it in a dish of rubbing alcohol for 1-2 minutes. Even better, sterilize it by placing it in boiling water for at least 5 minutes, or ideally 15 minutes, then letting the water cool.

You may be able to do this with only your fingers, but using a screwdriver makes it that much easier. Remember that you need to twist clockwise to drive a screw into a cork, a piece of wood, or anything else. Work carefully to ensure that the cork does not break apart into smaller pieces. Do not allow the screw to pierce the bottom of the cork and potentially touch the wine. If you\u2019re using a screw that\u2019s 2.25 or 2.5 in (5.7 or 6.4 cm) long, leave 1 in (2.5 cm) protruding from the top of the cork."

Wiggle the pliers back and forth a bit if the cork is giving some resistance. Alternatively, you can use the claw (nail-pulling side) of a hammer, or even a sturdy fork. If the screw pulls out of the cork and leaves it in the bottle, you probably didn\u2019t drive the screw deep enough into the cork to begin with.

Use a kitchen knife to score the foil just below the lip of the wine bottle. Take off the foil cap and discard it. Work very carefully with the knife. Nothing ruins a nice evening and a great bottle of wine like a deep gash in your hand! Grab a clean 2 in (5.1 cm) screw and a set of pliers. The average wine cork is about 1.75 in (4.4 cm) in length, and you need the screw to be long enough to drive deeply into the cork and yet protrude out of the top of it by about 0.5 in (1.3 cm).

Repeat the process, and try to drive the screw as far into the cork as you can without piercing the bottom of the cork. Use a clean screw-in hook instead of a traditional screw. Any screw-in hook with a screw portion that\u2019s at least 1.5 in (3.8 cm) long will work. Twist it in clockwise by hand, so that the screw portion penetrates about 1.5 in (3.8 cm), then pull on the hook portion to remove the cork. Bicycle hooks, which you use to hang a bike from a wall or ceiling, work well for this. The hook portion is usually vinyl coated, which makes them more comfortable to grip and pull on. Before using it, clean the screw-in hook in the same manner as described for a regular screw. Banging the Bottle with a Shoe Cut the cork foil with a knife tip and peel it away. Use a kitchen knife to score the foil just below the lip of the wine bottle, then remove the foil cap and throw it away. Hold the bottle securely with your free hand, but keep it well clear of the knife tip and blade. Place the wine bottle upside down between your thighs. Sit down on a steady chair and hold the wine bottle in a secure position between your legs. The top of the bottle should be pointing downward, while the base of the bottle should be pointing up. Grasp the bottle near its bottom (which is now facing upward) with one hand to hold it steady. Rap the bottle firmly but carefully with the sole of a shoe. Make sure you hold the bottle steady with your legs and one hand, and use the other to rap the base of the bottle with the sole of a flat shoe. Hit it 2-3 times to start out. With each strike, the cork should dislodge a little. Strike the bottle firmly and evenly across the base. Don't hit it as hard as you can, and don't graze the edge, or the bottle may break. However, if it doesn't seem to be making progress, you may need to hit it harder. Make sure the bottle is in a stable position. Don't just hold it between your thighs; use your free hand to grasp it, too. Check the cork and pull it out by hand when you can firmly grasp it. Take a look at the cork's progress, then continue striking the bottle until the cork has dislodged enough that you can grasp it with your hand and pull it out of the bottle. If you try pulling out the cork and it's still firmly inside the bottle, turn it upside down and strike it a few more times before trying again. Don't strike the bottle until the cork pops out on its own, or you may lose a few glasses of wine! Removing a Screw-Top Cap Twist the bottom of the bottle and the cap in opposite directions. Grasp the bottom of the bottle firmly in one hand, with your palm flat against the bottom. Wrap your other hand around the neck and cap. Your index finger and thumb should be wrapped tightly around the cap, while the rest of your hand should be loosely wrapped around the neck. Rotate your hands in opposite directions until you hear the \u201ccrack\u201d that indicates that the seal has broken. Some people prefer to grab the bottom of the bottle by wrapping their palm and fingers around the base. Use whichever grip is easier for you. You can grip your entire top hand around just the bottle cap, but this may make it more difficult to get a good grip, especially if you have arthritis or a similar condition. Twist the bottle\u2019s sleeve (or skirt) instead of the cap if it will rotate. Screw-top wine bottles have a sleeve (or skirt) on the neck of the bottle that connects to the sealed cap. In some cases, this sleeve will rotate independently of the bottle. Try gripping just the sleeve (not the cap) in one hand, and the bottom of the bottle in the other. Rotate your hands in opposite directions and see if you hear the \u201ccrack\u201d of the seal breaking. Many people find gripping the sleeve instead of the cap easier. However, not all sleeves will rotate independently of the bottle. In this case, you\u2019ll have to grip the cap instead. Try a dish towel, pliers, or various bottle-opener gadgets. If you can\u2019t get a good grip on the cap, try placing a dish towel between your hand and the cap. If that doesn\u2019t work, grip the cap firmly (but not too forcefully) between the jaws of a set of pliers, then twist the cap and the bottle in opposite directions. You can also look in stores and online for bottle and jar opener gadgets. Some are textured silicone mats, while others wrap around the cap or lid like a belt. Try out different models until you find the type that works best for you. If you squeeze too hard with the pliers, you might crush the cap and the top of the bottle.
