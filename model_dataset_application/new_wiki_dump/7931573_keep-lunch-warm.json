If the food is still warm, then you have a good thermos that will keep your food warm for lunch. If it is cold, then you may want to find a different thermos or try the test again and heat the food or liquid to a higher temperature. If you have a food thermometer, then you might even check the temperature to ensure it is near the safe range of 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C). If it is a degree or two off, then this is nothing to worry about. However, if the temperature is much lower, such as 100 \u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C), then it might not be safe to eat."
