          "description":"In order to develop basic penmanship skills, you should begin by learning how to hold your pen properly. Comfort is obviously the most important element when it comes to holding a pen or pencil, but you should also make sure that you are evenly distributing the pressure. For example, try and balance your pen evenly between your thumb, pointer, and middle finger. This will help you avoid cramping when you write and will give you the most control over your lettering. Hold the pen close to the tip for better grip and control."

Consider the comfort level of the pen, thickness of the ink, and level of control you have while writing when testing out new pens."

Try copying out a few paragraphs of text from a book or the internet in order to see any patterns in your writing that may emerge.

When you write a letter the way you like it- with the appropriate height, curve, and slant- continue to write that letter over and over again and fill up an entire page. This will help you develop consistent lettering that is unique to your own individual style. Try writing a full page of upper and lower case letters for each letter in the alphabet."
