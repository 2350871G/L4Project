          "description":"Pour 1 qt (1 L) of vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed skillet. Set the skillet on the stove and allow the oil to heat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). A cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven works best, but any skillet with a heavy bottom will suffice. You can also use an electric deep fryer. The oil should be at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep, if not a little deeper. Do not allow the oil to fill more than half the depth of the pan, however. Heat the oil over a medium-high heat setting, and adjust this setting as needed to maintain the temperature throughout the frying process. Check the temperature continually using a frying or candy thermometer."

If desired, you could use 3 to 4 egg whites instead of using 2 whole eggs. Doing so will make the final coating lighter and crispier in texture."

Crowding the bowl, on the other hand, may create pockets of uneven coating."

Stir the okra gently to prevent the pieces from sticking together and to ensure that all sides brown. Do not stir too quickly, however, since doing so could cause the breading to break off."
