To use the catalyst, squeeze out a dab of it from the tube and apply it directly to the silicone adhesive. The catalyst hardens the silicone by removing water from the compound and increasing the purity of the adhesive. You can use 2 dabs of the catalyst to speed up the drying process even more."

          "description":"If the layer of adhesive is too thick, it will take more time to dry. By scraping off any additional adhesive, you allow the air to get to the adhesive and shorten the drying time. If you don\u2019t have a putty knife, you can use a butter knife to get rid of the excess adhesive. The same goes for sealant. The more sealant you have, the longer it will take to cure. Remove extra sealant with a putty knife."

          "description":"Your adhesive must dry in room temperature conditions and in a well-ventilated area. Open the windows and doors around the adhesive to ensure there is ample air coming in and out of the room. There is a misconception that the hotter the room is, the quicker the adhesive will dry. The reality is that humidity will halt the drying process, so always keep the room well-ventilated.Did you know? Drying and curing are totally different things. Drying is the initial, rapid process where moisture and water evaporate. Curing is much slower and refers to the chemical changes that take place after silicone gets exposed to oxygen. Your silicone will be a fully functional sealant if it's just dried \u2013 you don't necessarily need to wait for it to cure."

          "headline":"Use a fan or heat lamp to dry the adhesive.",
          "description":"Place the fan or lamp about 3 feet (0.91 m) from the adhesive. If you\u2019re using a fan, keep it at a middle setting instead of going right to the highest setting. Keep the fan or lamp by the adhesive for about 1 hour. You can also use a blow dryer to really speed up the process. If you go this route, keep the blow dryer at a moderate temperature and stay at least a foot away from the adhesive when blow drying it. If the adhesive is exposed to extreme temperatures, it can crack. Only use the blow dryer for between 5-10 minutes."

These adhesives dry faster in cold or damp environments, making them extremely versatile. You can also buy low-temperature sealant, but be wary of using it in very extreme cold. Low-temperature sealant will hold up between 32\u201340 \u00b0F (0\u20134 \u00b0C) degrees, but sealant usually won\u2019t cure well below freezing."

If the adhesive takes longer to dry than it says on the tube, this is most likely because it has gone past its shelf life. Sealants, however, are good for about 12 months.

As long as the temperature is between 59\u201380 \u00b0F (15\u201327 \u00b0C), your adhesive should be in good shape. Don\u2019t keep the adhesive in your garage during the summer.
