Wash the door with soapy water and let it dry. Fill a bucket with soapy water and grab a sponge. Use the soapy sponge to wash any dirt or debris from the door.

Applying the Paint Stir paint before applying. When you buy your paint, make sure you pick up paint stirrers with it. Dip the stirrer into the paint and move it through until the color and consistency are as even as possible. Use a brush on depressed panels and edges. Apply the paint in even strokes until each panel has an even coat of paint. Make sure to apply more paint to your brush periodically, so your strokes are spreading the paint in roughly equal amounts.
