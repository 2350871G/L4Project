Use this method if you only have a few anthills. This method is more environmentally friendly than other methods, so choose this one if that's a concern for you. Boil water. You will need a large amount of water for each anthill. Boil a large soup pot of water per anthill. Remove the pot from the stove. Using protective gloves, remove the pot from the stove.
