For instance, a large box of cereal creates less waste than several smaller boxes of cereal that add up to the same amount. If you prefer individual servings, portion the food out into reusable containers when you get home. For instance, if you like small portions of pretzels, buy a big bag and then use small sealed containers to create individual portions.

You can also bring reusable containers from home to make the purchase even greener. Make sure to get a cashier to write the weight of the container on it so that you don't pay for the container."
