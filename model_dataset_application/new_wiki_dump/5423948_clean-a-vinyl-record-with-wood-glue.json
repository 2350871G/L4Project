The constant rubbing and wiping you do to clean them can eventually cause scratching and warped grooves, which can even make a vinyl unplayable. The best way to tell if your vinyl should be cleaned is by taking one finger and swiping it gently around the record one time. If you see any dust or debris on your finger tip then that means you probably have to clean it."

One important thing to make note of when buying wood glue is to find a bottle with a good pouring tip and that it is free of urea-formaldehyde. This type of glue works best because it dries faster at room temperature than other types of glue, and it is much easier to remove."
