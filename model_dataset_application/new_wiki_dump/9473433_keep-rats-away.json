You must seal these to prevent a rat from slipping in. You can stuff the gaps with copper or steel wool. Apply spackle, caulk, or cement on top. On doors (including garage doors), add a weatherstrip to the edges. If any of your screens on your windows or vents have been damaged, get them repaired as soon as possible. You can hire a pest-control expert or handyman to inspect the building for you. Get a plumber to check your pipes."

Some good practices include:\nWashing your dishes as soon as you are done eating. Emptying your trash can regularly,  especially when there is food waste. Cleaning up food or drink spills immediately. Cleaning your kitchen daily and putting away any food. Picking up piles of clothes, cardboard boxes, or old papers, as these might be used for nesting."

You can get glass jars, plastic food containers, or sealed metal boxes at grocery stores, home goods stores, kitchen stores, or online. Large glass jars are perfect for storing flour, coffee, tea, and sugar. Make sure that the top seals on securely. You can get plastic boxes that look like cereal boxes. These will let you pour cereal just as easily as you would from the box. Baked goods would do well in a secure wooden or metal bread box.

You can:\nSoak cotton balls in peppermint oil and leave them in drawers. Put mothballs on drawers and shelves. Sprinkle crushed pepper or spray a pepper spray near openings and holes. Scatter cat litter near rat-prone areas, like in attics or near a drafty window."
