If you normally eat dessert, try to replace your dessert with honey and fruit. This will satisfy your sweet tooth in a healthy fashion. Make sure to only use a little honey. As fruit is already sweet, a little bit goes a long way. Have your fruit coated in small drops of honey rather than lathered in it."

          "description":"If you want a frosting or glaze for something like cupcakes or cake, avoid using glazes made with powdered sugar. Instead, drizzle some honey over your baked goods and then spread it around. This will lessen the amount you need, as pure honey is sweeter than sugar-based glazes, and lessen the amount of cane sugar a recipe uses. This works best if you apply the glaze as soon as you take an item out of the oven."

Honey can add sweetness to basic breakfast foods, minimizing your need to eat sugary meals at breakfast. If you, say, normally have toast with cinnamon and sugar, use honey instead. You can also squirt a small amount of honey over low-sugar, healthy types of cereal. If you're an oatmeal eater, use honey instead of brown sugar to sweeten your oatmeal."

Honey is sweeter than sugar, and replacing half a cup of sugar with a half a cup of honey will result in your baked good tasting too sweet. In general, for every one cup of sugar, use 1/2 to 2/3 of a cup of honey. Use your best judgment when adding honey. If your baked good tastes a little bland after adding half a cup, for example, add a bit more until you get the flavor you want."
