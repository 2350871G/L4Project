Shopping: You can buy knitting needles and yarn at any craft store including Hobby Lobby, Walmart, Target, Ben Franklin, Michaels, etc. Decide how many colors you want to include in your scarf.

Decide how many stitches you want to include. This will ultimately determine how wide you want your width to be. (25 stitches works well.) Make 25 loops and hook them onto one of the needles.
