This is optional but helps to prevent the cookie from being overly sweet; for some, the fudge flavor might not go well with the Oreo filling. Adding the Fudge Sauce Add fudge sauce to a cookie half per cookie double. Add with care and do not overfill. Press each of the cookies back together again. Wipe away any oozing fudge sauce using your finger or a butter knife. They should look like normal Oreo cookies when done. Arrange on a sheet of wax paper on a freezer-proof tray or plate.  Freezing and Serving the Cookies Place the fudge-filled Oreos into the freezer.  Let them sit for up to about 10-15 minutes.  Remove from the freezer. When you take them out, they should feel cold and the fudge should be frozen or just about frozen. If you take it out and it still isn't frozen, then put them back in for 5-8 minutes.
