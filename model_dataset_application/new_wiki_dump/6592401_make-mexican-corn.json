          "description":"Preheat an outdoor charcoal or gas grill to a medium-high heat setting. Oil the grill grate when ready. If you're using a charcoal grill, fill and light one chimney full of charcoal briquettes. Once the charcoal is evenly covered in gray ash, spread the coals evenly over half of the coal grate. If you're using a gas grill, preheat the burners on one half of the grill to high heat. Position the grate in place, cover the grill, and wait approximately 5 minutes for the grill to finish preheating."

          "headline":"Meanwhile, husk the corn.",
          "description":"While the grill preheats, remove the husks from the corn. Rinse the exposed cobs under cool, running water and dry well with clean paper towels. While rinsing the corn, use your hands to peel away most of the silky threads still clinging to the kernels. You can technically grill the corn without removing its husks, but traditional elotes are lightly charred, and you won't be able to achieve that effect without removing the husks."

          "headline":"Grill the corn over direct heat.",
          "description":"Arrange the cobs of corn over the portion of the grill receiving direct heat. Cook them for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the ears are evenly charred and hot throughout. Use tongs to turn and rotate the corn every few minutes. The corn should be lightly charred over all sides, and rotating it is the only way to accomplish that. Remove the corn from the grill as soon as it appears done."

          "headline":"Sprinkle the seasonings.",

Note that you should keep the husks on the corn when using the roasting technique. Do not husk the corn before cooking it. The exact amount of cooking time will vary depending on the size of the ears and the level of doneness you prefer. You should begin checking the corn after 25 minutes. Continue checking it every 5 to 10 minutes after that, cooking the corn up to 45 minutes if needed."

Once you can safely handle it without burning your fingers, peel off the husks. You can either completely remove the husks or wrap them around the stem end of each ear to serve as a handle."

If using frozen corn, thaw it before adding the corn to the pan. For a fresher alternative, you could use a large, smooth knife to slice the kernels off four or five fresh cobs. The exact amount of cooking time will vary depending on how often you stir the corn and how charred you prefer it. If you toss the corn infrequently, the process should take 6 to 10 minutes. If you stir it frequently, the process may take 15 to 20 minutes."

If you don't wish to use jalape\u00f1o, try using a red chile pepper or other small hot pepper. Regardless of the variety you choose, however, you should still remove the seeds and mince the pepper before adding it. When ready, the pepper and garlic should both seem lightly toasted and more fragrant."

Toss well to combine. Cotija cheese is the most convention choice, but crumbled Feta cheese would be a good substitute. You could also use grated Romano or grated Parmesan cheese. Adjust the seasonings as needed to match your personal sense of taste.
