Assembling the crib incorrectly may endanger your baby. Contact the store or manufacturer if you are having trouble with the instructions. Contact the store or manufacturer if you are missing any pieces of the construction."

Check for loose fittings including bolts, screws, joints, awnings, etc.. that could collapse the crib and/or fall on the infant. Look for sharp edges or rough spots. This could include improperly sanded wood on the crib frame, metal protrusions, and improperly fastened screws. Check the mattress support hooks. Be sure the mattress cannot accidentally flip and entrap the child. Make sure there are no gaps larger than two fingers between the sides of the crib and the mattress so the baby's body cannot slip out. Avoid corner posts over 1/16th inch high so a baby's clothing cannot catch."

Be sure the bassinet is cleaned appropriately if it is a re-used one. Check that the bassinet sits firmly on its stand. You should be keeping the bassinet/stand near the bed of the parent(s). Examine the bassinet and the stand for loose parts or linens. Use only the authorized mattress (or padding) and fitted sheet for the bassinet. Always make sure you use sheets that will fit snugly around the mattress--check the dimensions for a match. Don\u2019t add toys with stuffing or additional non-fitted bedding material. Don\u2019t let things dangle into the bassinet such as from a mobile, curtain cords, or window blinds. Place your baby so they rest on their back in the bassinet. Do not use bassinets for infants that can already sit, climb, or otherwise move significantly on their own."
