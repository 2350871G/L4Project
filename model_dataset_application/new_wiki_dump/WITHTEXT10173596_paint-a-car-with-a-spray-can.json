You will slowly start to see the paint flaking away from the car. Once the majority of the paint has been removed, switch to 1500-grit sandpaper. Make sure that any rust on the car is thoroughly sanded off. This is a long process but will make your paint job look much better."

Squeeze the putty directly out of the tube into the hole until it completely covered. Smooth the surface and remove any excess putty using a flat-edged putty knife. Allow the putty to dry for 1 hour before rubbing it over with 1200-grit sand paper. Car putty can be purchased online or from a hardware store."

This will help to dissolve the wax and baked on dirt. Wipe the cellulose thinner over the area using an old cloth. You will only need a small amount as it is extremely potent. Cellulose thinner can be purchased from a hardware store. Always use cellulose thinner in a well-ventilated area as the fumes can be toxic."

If you are trying to cover a large surface, such as a window, tape pieces of paper over the surface to protect it from the spray paint. Don't forget to cover any areas that aren\u2019t metal, such as car bumpers, wheel rims, side mirrors, and window frames. Painters tape can be purchased from a hardware store.
