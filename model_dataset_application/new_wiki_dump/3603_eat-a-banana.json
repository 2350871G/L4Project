If you have not peeled one before, you might find one of these methods easy:\nPeel the banana from the stem end. Snap back the stalk at the top of the fruit, then pull it downwards alongside the fruit. Pull the rest of the skin off in similar strips. Peel the banana from the blossom end. This is the flat, brown stub at the end of the banana. Pinch just behind the blossom end to break it apart, then peel bits of it downward. If you don't want the whole banana at once, cut it in half before peeling. Cover the half you won't be eating right away with plastic wrap, and store it in the fridge."
