This variation removes the need to ask other players if they are also infected - they'll be moaning and shuffling like a zombie! This can also add an interesting element of strategy. Since zombie players can't move quickly, they need to work together to trap other players."

When tagged, players are infected for a set amount of time (usually 3 or 5 minutes). If this time elapses without everyone being caught, players are \"cured\" once their timer is up, and need to be tagged once more!"
