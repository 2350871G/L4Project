  "text":" Baking Eggless Chocolate Chip Cookies Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire cooling rack. Be sure to use a spatula to transfer the cookies so that you don't burn yourself or break them. Once the cookies are completely cool, you can frost them or serve them as they are. Baking Eggless Oatmeal Cookies Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and prepare two large baking sheets. You can do this by covering them with parchment paper or by coating them with nonstick cooking spray. Beat the butter until it is light and fluffy, then mix in the sugar.

Combine 1 tablespoon (7 grams) of ground flax seed with 2\u00bd to 3 tablespoons (37.5 to 45 milliliters) of warm water. Whisk the mixture until smooth, then let it sit for 5 minutes. Add the flax egg and vanilla extract to the butter mixture. Keep stirring until the flax egg and vanilla extract are mixed evenly throughout the beaten sugar-butter. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Mixing your dry ingredients separately helps everything mix together evenly. If you do it all at once, you're more likely to get streaks of unmixed ingredients. Stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture using a rubber spatula.

Make sure that they are spaced 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) apart, as they will spread a little while baking. Flatten the cookies until they are \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) thick. You can do this using a drinking glass or the palm of your hand. Don't worry if the cookies look too thick; they will continue to flatten and spread while they are being baked. Bake the cookies for 12 to 15 minutes. They are ready when the edges turn a golden brown color. The centers should be still moist. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then let them finish cooling on a wire rack. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies from the baking sheet to the wire rack so that you don't break them or burn yourself. Once they have completely cooled, you can serve them. Finding and Using Substitutions Try a flax egg if you are making oatmeal cookies.

Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, then use it in your recipe. You can try using a flax egg for other cookie recipes, but keep in mind that they will be soft and chewy.

You will need to follow the instructions on the package, as each brand will be a little different.
