      "headline":"Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0C/Fan 140\u00b0C/Gas 3 and prepare the pan for the brownies.",
      "description":"The pan should be a 9\" x 9\" (or 23cm x 23cm). Grease the tin by taking a stick of butter and rub it on all edges. Butter spray also works perfectly well. The tin should be (ideally) a 23cm by 9in square cake tin, but similar sizes would work fine. Line the cake tin. Take some baking parchment and cut it to at least 4in bigger than the tin itself. Place inside the tin, it should stick to all edges thanks to the butter."

    {
      "headline":"Melt the chocolate with the butter on the stove.",
      "description":"To avoid burning the chocolate, melt it in a bowl over a saucepan of boiling water. Break the chocolate into pieces into a heat-proof bowl. Having the chocolate in small pieces makes it easier to stir and makes it melt quicker. When the chocolate is nearly melted, add broken up butter and stir until they are both mixed together and you have a smooth, brown paste. Set aside to cool. Place it out of the way, but keep it at room temperature, don't place the bowl in the refrigerator, as it may solidify again."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Whisk the eggs and sugar together to form a thick and silky mixture.",
      "description":"Whisk the eggs until you achieve a glossy, pale color. Gradually whisk in the Muscovado sugar until you have a thick, rich texture. Gently fold this mixture into the melted chocolate until well mixed. Carefully sift the baking soda and flour in and stir until well-combined."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Pour your brownie batter into your lined cake tin when happy with it.",
      "description":"Place in the preheated oven. The brownies will take approximately 35-45 minutes to bake, but check frequently until the surface is firm at your fingertips. Insert a wooden dowel into the brownie to see if the inside is baked. Moist crumbs should come out with the dowel."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Leave to cool for at least an hour after properly baked to firm the cake.",
      "description":"When cool to touch, cut into 16 squares and serve with a dessert dressing of your choice."
