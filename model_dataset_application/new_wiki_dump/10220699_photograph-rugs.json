Look for a spot near a window or doorway that will allow natural light to fill your picture. Avoid using overhead lights as they often create unflattering shadows on your subject. Avoid using the flash on your camera. The flash on your camera is a bomb of hard, intense light that will cheapen the quality of your images and cast unflattering shadows on your subject."

Stretch out the rug to avoid any wrinkles. Hide your pins in the fabric of the rug. Try to pick a pin that has a similar color to your rug."

Chose a day that provides more soft light than hard light. An overcast, cloudy day will provide the perfect layer of soft light for your photo shoot. A bright and sunny day may cause challenges for your shots."

Use a reflector to add extra soft light to an image. If you don\u2019t have a reflector, a plain white poster board will work as a DIY reflector. Simply shine a flashlight onto the white poster board and reflect the light onto your image."

          "description":"When using a camera indoors, it is a good idea to use shutter priority mode (Tv for Canon, S for Nikon). A lower shutter speed will capture more light. Anywhere from 1/60 to 1/200 is a good shutter speed for indoor lighting. If you want to shoot with a slower shutter speed, consider using a tripod. This will allow you to maximize the amount of light in your image without hurting the image's clarity. For outdoor lighting, a shutter speed of 1/200 to 1/250 is a good range. Anything faster is unnecessary and will not allow enough light into your shot."

If you want to switch to manual focus, consider using a tripod to maximize image clarity. Use a slower shutter speed for close up shots. 1/60 to 1/100 is a good range for a close-up shot. Crank your ISO as high as you can without adding too much \"noise.\" Around 1600 will produce the best results for indoor lighting."

Screw the horizontal mount attachment into the base of your tripod. Use the adjustment knob to secure the attachment attaching your camera. Screw your camera onto the horizontal attachment arm. Place your tripod on a table or platform to get the necessary height to take a perfect overhead shot."
