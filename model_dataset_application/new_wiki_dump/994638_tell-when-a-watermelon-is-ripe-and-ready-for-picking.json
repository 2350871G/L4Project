          "description":"There are a lot of different factors which will determine how long it takes for your melons to ripen, but it should be somewhere between 2 to 4 months. Look at the seed packet for the watermelons you're planting for an approximation of how long it'll take for them to ripen. Write the date you planted your seeds on the seed packet and store it in a safe place. That way you can always keep track of exactly when your watermelons will be ready. The time it takes for your melons to ripen can vary based on the type of watermelon, the climate you're growing them in, and the type of soil, among other things. Don't rely on the expected time frame to tell when your watermelons will be ripe."

Look at the \u201cfield spot\u201d of the melon, where it has been resting on the ground as it grows. A buttery yellow color is a good indicator that the watermelon is ripe, whereas a white field spot means that it needs more time. As you turn the watermelon over, look for and remove any insects hiding on its underside."

Look for this around each melon to help determine which ones are ready to be picked. If the whole vine starts to turn brown while there are still watermelons left on it, harvest them immediately. This indicates that the vine is dying, and the watermelons are as ripe as they'll ever be."

A ripe watermelon will give off a lower-pitched and more hollow sound, whereas an unripe one will have a higher pitch to it. This can take some practice but is one of the more reliable ways to check for ripeness. If you're unsure if your melon is making the right sound, find someone who can demonstrate it for you on a melon they know to be right. Ask around or check online to find out what the perfect melon should sound like. Use your phone or another device to record the sound of a melon you think is ripe. If it's perfect when you cut into it, you can keep that recording to test the sound of other melons from the same and future crops."

Get close up to the watermelon and inhale deeply. A ripe melon should have a sweet scent to it, and remind you of the flavor of a perfectly ripe watermelon. If you're growing a lot of watermelons, this test might become less effective. It's much more difficult to pick out the smell of 1 watermelon from a field of them than it would be testing one on its own. While it works on watermelons, the smell test is even more effective with other types of melon."
