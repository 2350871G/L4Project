          "description":"The color of teak wood varies depending on what species a tree is and what part of the tree the wood is from. Color ranges from dark golden-brown to yellowish-white. Knowing what type of teak you're looking for is important when examining color. The outer layer of the tree is called sapwood and is yellowish-white in color. This wood has a higher moisture content and is therefore weaker than heartwood. The core of the tree is called heartwood and ranges from golden brown to darker brown. This wood is harder, stronger, more expensive, and generally more desirable than sapwood."

          "description":"Some teak dealers or stores may stain the wood, therefore masking its true color. Make sure to ask if the wood you're interested in has any stains on it. If it does, you'll need to identify the wood in a different way. Since teak wood gets darker with age, you should also ask about the age of the wood so you can make sure you get the type of wood you want."

          "description":"The grain of true teak wood is generally straight. It will look like straight streaks or lines of a darker color than the rest of the wood. If the wood grain doesn't look straight or at least mostly straight, you'll want to ask some questions. Depending on how the wood was cut, the grain could also be slightly wavy."
