          "description":"The sooner you choose a date, the sooner you can get started with planning other elements of the party. Consult with the person whose birthday it is to determine a good day for the party. Check their schedule and take note of any holidays around that time. Keep in mind that many people travel for different holidays. It is advisable to host the party on a weekend. More people will be willing and able to come if it is on a weekend, because many people do not have to work on the weekends."

          "headline":"Select a time for the party.",
          "description":"Appropriate times will vary based on who the party is for and the age of that person. If you are throwing a birthday party for a child, host it in the late morning or early afternoon. This is most convenient for families. If you are throwing a party for an adult, then an evening party is appropriate."

          "headline":"Decide on a budget for the party.",
          "description":"Parties can easily consume a great deal of money, so it is important to come up with a budget and stick to it. Come up with an overall budget, meaning a total amount that you want to spend on the birthday party. Most people believe that a budget up to \u00a3200-300 is reasonable, and many feel keeping party costs under \u00a3150 is completely doable. Break down each element of the party (e.g. invitations, food, drink, decorations, venue) and decide how much should be spent in each area."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Create a guest list for the party.",
          "description":"There are a few reasons for doing this. A guest list will help you ensure that no one is forgotten when sending out invitations. It will aid you in deciding where to hold the party. A guest list of 12 people means you could host the party in someone's home, if you wanted to do so, but a guest list of 50 people will likely need to be held somewhere else. This will eliminate the risk of people the birthday person does not want attending showing up to the party. Having a number of guests in mind enables you to determine how much food and drink will need to be provided, if you are doing that yourself or having it catered."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Consider where to have the party.",
          "description":"This involves knowing the individual for whom the party is being thrown. Take into consideration what the birthday person wants. If he/she wants a more elaborate party, then work to plan the party in a venue that enables that. If he/she is into small gatherings with close friends, then aim for that instead. You will need to decide if you want to have the party in your home or someone else's home in order to keep the venue cost-free. Think about making a reservation at a restaurant if your party is of a reasonable size. Most restaurants can accommodate up to about 25 people without too much issue. Another idea is to host the party at a party or banquet hall. This will be a more expensive option, but it can easily accommodate more people. Think about the guest list and keep in mind if any guests need accommodations. Be sure that wherever you choose caters to people who need certain accommodations, like wheelchairs.

Stefanie Chu-Leong\t\t\tOwner and Senior Event Planner, Stellify Events\t\t\t\tChoose a time and location that work well together. An outdoor party in the woods at 5 pm can get cold fast and require heat lamps while a 1 pm party in a clubhouse might get warm and need a coat check room. Make sure you have the right amenities for your time and location and that they complement each other."

          "headline":"Decide if the party should have a theme.",
          "description":"Themed birthday parties can be a lot of fun, but they can also end up being more costly when you consider buying everything to match the theme. Weigh the pros and cons of having a themed party based on the person whose birthday it is. Would they like a themed birthday party? Consider whether it is a kid's party or an adult's party. Choose a theme that is age-appropriate, if you decide to go this route. For example, appropriate themes for children would be based on kid-friendly television shows or movies, circus, movie theater, a children's book, or carnival. On the other hand, appropriate themes for adults might be a black-and-white affair, casino, a decade theme, or an adult movie or television show."

          "headline":"Purchase and send out invitations.",
          "description":"Once the earlier details are decided upon, then it is time to send out invitations to the guest list. It is best to send out the invitations about 3-4 weeks in advance of the party in order to give people enough time to plan for it. Be sure to include RSVP information on the invitation. Sending out the invitations after you have decided on the earlier details ensures that you have the guest list secured and that you have decided on whether to have a themed party, making you more organized. Be sure to reach out to some of the invited guests for help. They can help set up, clean up, provide food, decorate, and more. It is not necessary to do it all by yourself!"

          "headline":"Create a plan for the food and beverages.",
          "description":"Based on what you have decided for the party, you have different options for these aspects. Decide what type of food will be best for the party. If you chose a theme, then make sure the food flows with that theme. For example, a camo cake would work great for an army-themed party, but it would seem out of place for a princess-themed party. Know whether any of your guests have food allergies. If so, be sure to provide options that are safe for them to eat or let them know that they are welcome to bring their own food. Be realistic about how much food and drink to provide based on the length of the party. A party that is planned to be an hour or two might only require refreshments and birthday desserts, while a party that is meant to last for several hours will need more of a meal. Make sure that you plan for enough food and drink to cater to all of the guests. Err on the side of too much food rather than too little."

If the party is going to be at a party or banquet hall, then you need to check with their staff about catering options. Find out if you can bring the food, if they will cater the food, or if they have particular vendors they use to cater food for parties. Decide whether alcohol should be provided, if it is an adult birthday party. For example, if the birthday person does not drink and has many friends and family who do not drink, then alcohol would be unnecessary."
