The exact amount of oil you will need will depend on the thickness of your chocolate and your desired consistency. Start by stirring in just a little splash, then add more if you need to. Use an unflavored oil so you don't alter the taste of your dessert. Coconut and canola oils work nicely for this, and coconut oil in particular has a pleasing texture on the palate. This will work best if you add the oil to the chocolate before you heat it. However, you can add it afterwards if you need to."

Just make sure you heat up the milk to about the same temperature as the chocolate before you add it, or else the chocolate will seize. Any milk will work, but whole milk will give you the richest result. You can also add warm cream to the chocolate for an even richer texture."

Make sure your bowls and utensils are dry before you begin working with the chocolate, and do not add water in an attempt to thin out the chocolate. If a little water does accidentally get into your chocolate, adding more water can actually reverse the seizing process. Add 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of boiling water at a time, stirring vigorously after each addition. However, this will change the texture of your chocolate."
