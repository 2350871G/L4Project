          "description":"In order to purchase a home with favorable mortgage terms (and in many cases, to purchase a home at all), you must have steady, reliable income, and a good credit score and history. Renting entails shorter-term commitments, and so the income and credit requirements, if any, are usually more lenient. If you expect your income to grow, you may want to wait until it does to purchase a home. That way, you may be able to get a better deal, and/or afford a home that better meets your size or location requirements. If you do not know your credit history or score, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) allows each person one free credit report per year. By paying a small extra fee, you can choose to see your credit score as well."

          "description":"Home prices and rent costs are determined in most cases by market demand; the amount you actually pay also depends upon factors like your credit score and the down payment you make. The amount you can afford to pay for rent or a mortgage depends not only on your income but also on a number of other factors, including bills and expenses. Creating a budget can help you determine your expenses, and the amount you can set aside for housing costs."

Home prices and rent costs can vary substantially in different areas, even if they are relatively close to each other. How long will you live in your home? Buying a home is a long-term commitment, while renting offers more flexibility. Do you need or want home equity? As you pay off a mortgage, you develop increasing home equity (the difference between the home\u2019s value and the amount you still owe on the mortgage). You may want to borrow against this equity for current or future expenses, such as paying for a child\u2019s education."

Many of these are readily available online. They will help you to determine the average rental and home purchase costs in your area, the amount of rent you could pay, how much you could afford to pay for a home, and what the long-term costs would be for each option. While these calculators aren\u2019t a replacement for careful consideration, they can provide you with a quick initial sense of the cost difference between renting and buying."

          "headline":"Determine how much you will pay in rent.",
          "description":"To determine the overall costs of renting, multiply the monthly rent costs by the number of years you expect to live in the rented home. Don\u2019t forget to account for rent increases. For instance:\nImagine you want to live in a home for at least 7 years. Your initial rent is $800 a month, with a yearly increase of 5%. At the end of 7 years, you will have paid $78155 in total rent costs."

To evaluate these costs against rental costs, compare using the same number of years. For instance, using the previous example:\nYou will live in the home for at least 7 years. The home costs $110,000, and you make a monthly mortgage payment of $1000. At the end of 7 years, you will have paid $84000 in mortgage costs."

          "description":"The costs of renting a home are not limited to the rent payment itself, nor are the costs of owning a home limited to the mortgage payment. Depending on your situation, there may be insurance payments, maintenance costs, and miscellaneous expenses. In addition, you may be able to get tax benefits or other perks that offset your overall costs. To determine the true costs of owning or renting, you will have to calculate net costs. Using the previous examples:\nIf over 7 years, you pay $78155 in rent payments, but also $20 a month in rental insurance, your overall costs will be $79835. If over 7 years you pay $84000 in mortgage costs, but receive a tax break for the interest portion of mortgage costs, and that portion is $200 per month, then your overall costs will actually be $67200. Don\u2019t forget to include whatever projected maintenance costs are applicable to your situation (such as $250 a month for snow removal during the winter months, or $75 dollars a month to mow the lawn during the summer months). Don\u2019t forget to consider the equity you gain from owning a home. While it does not strictly lower the cost of owning a home, it may provide you financial benefits (you can borrow against it, and equity debt may be tax deductible). To determine whether renting or buying a home is more advantageous for strictly financial reasons, simply look at which overall cost is lower. You may also want to consider comparing costs on a monthly basis. Monthly rental payments may initially be cheaper than monthly mortgage payments. However, rent costs typically rise, while mortgage payments are typically stable. This means that over time, your monthly mortgage payment may become lower than a monthly rental payment."
