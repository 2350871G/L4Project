If you see an ant colony or lots of ants near your aphid-infested plants, try to get rid of the ants by using a sticky band wrapped around a tree or other type of ant trap. Ants and aphids have a symbiotic relationship. The ants protect the aphids from predators and the aphids produce a sugary fluid the ants eat. You can also use vinegar, lemon juice, or cinnamon to help keep ants from creeping too close to your plants."

The aphids will be drawn to these plants and will stay away from less appetizing plants as a result. Aphids also like dahlias, larkspur, and zinnias. These decoy plants are a bit like a sacrifice to the aphids in your garden. The aphids will concentrate on them, so avoid becoming too attached. Not controlling aphids will only lead to an increase in their numbers, eventually leading to their spread to other plants. You will still need to police their numbers on your decoy plants. How far away you plant the trap plants will depend on the specific type of plant and how much room it needs to grow. Start with at least a distance of 2 feet (24 in)."
