  "text":" Prepare the Croissants Slice the two croissants horizontally into two halves. You can use a butter knife if you have one. If you don't, use a regular knife.

Place the croissant halves in an oven proof tray, Toast for 2 minutes or until the color changes. Prepare the Egg Crack the egg. You should crack it into a small microwavable bowl since you will be microwaving the egg. You can also crack it into a different bowl then transfer it into a microwave safe bowl. Add salt and pepper. There is no measurement of how much salt and pepper you should use - simply add however much you wish. If you would like to add other seasonings, you can add those in this step. Add any vegetables that you may wish to add. This step is completely optional but it does give the dish more flavor. Using a whisk or a fork, mix the ingredients together. Keep mixing until you cannot see the egg white anymore. You should mix at least for one full minute. Cover the bowl with a lid. This step is very important. If you do not cover the bowl while microwaving, your egg might not be thoroughly cooked. If you do not have a lid for your bowl, use a microwave safe plate to cover it. Microwave for 40 seconds. Not all microwaves work the same way. If the egg is not cooked within 40 seconds, add 10 more seconds. Remove the egg from the bowl. Make sure the egg stays intact. The egg should look like a patty. To easily remove the patty, you can flip the bowl and gently tap on the bottom until the egg falls out. If you break the shape, scramble the egg and follow the remaining steps. Assemble the Sandwich Cut the egg patty into 2 equal halves. Use a knife to do this. Make sure you take precautions as the egg might be hot.

Most people usually prefer cheese at the bottom and egg on top of the cheese. You can customize it however you want. Microwave it for 15 seconds.
