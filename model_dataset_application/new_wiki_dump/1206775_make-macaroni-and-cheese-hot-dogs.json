  "text":" Making the Macaroni and Cheese Boil the dry elbows in a large pot of salted water. Cook them according to the package instructions, until the elbows are soft and no longer hard. Drain the pasta in a colander once fully cooked. Shake the colander around to remove any excess water from the elbows. Place the pasta back in the pot. In a medium-sized saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Whisk in the salt, pepper, and flour. Mix until smooth and then fold in the milk. Bring the mixture to a boil and keep whisking. Cook for about 1-2 minutes until the mixture thickens slightly. Fold in the cheese and stir until melted. The cheese sauce should be thick and cheesy once the cheese melts. Pour the cheese sauce all over the pasta. Stir well with a wooden spoon until the pasta is fully coated. Set the macaroni and cheese aside to cool.  Cooking the Hot Dogs and Serving Cook the hot dogs. You can choose to grill, bake, or boil the hot dogs. Cook the hot dogs until they are no longer raw. Place each hot dog on a hot dog bun.
