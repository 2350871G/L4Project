      "headline":"Complete the Cactakara Forest questline.",
      "description":"Before everything else, you need to progress your story. The Cactakara Forest questline involves giant fighting robots, ancient civilizations, and a quirky side-character who gets a change of heart due to your good graces. Each quest has clear conditions, and with the auto-complete function, it would probably just take you a couple hours at the most if you don\u2019t pause to mess around. In lieu of spoilers, the questline ends when a plan of yours falls short, and you\u2019re prompted to head back to Navea."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Get to level 40.",
      "description":"If you just speed-completed the quests, chances are that you may have not met the level conditions. Level 40 is the minimum level requirement to get a subclass. You might have reached Level 40 at this point, but if you haven\u2019t yet, it\u2019s time to kill some monsters! The highest-leveled ones are around the Rarnor Falls, where your last few Quests took place. Sarpas and Caustic Sarpas are around level 40, which makes them perfect to grind for your EXP needs. You can also tackle Daily Quests from NPCs, missions from the Mission Boards in town, or even use the Monster XP Books you most likely found or received while exploring."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Head on to Navea.",
      "description":"Once at level 40, it\u2019s time to head back to Navea. You most likely remember it from the end of the Crescent Hill questline. The easiest route to Navea is by going to a nearby Warp Portal. It\u2019s a pagoda-like structure with a decorated teardrop-shaped blue crystal floating above it. Click the large floating crystal and you\u2019ll see a selection of places to go to. At the very top is Navea; click the city name. Warp Portals can be found on the world map as a blue wing icon in a white circle. If you still have some errands to run in Crescent Hill or fancy the long route, head back to Brevis. Go through the portal to Crescent Hill, then when you\u2019re ready, just head on northwest until you see the giant walls and gate."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Find the church.",
      "description":"Navea is a huge sprawling city, so it\u2019s easy to get lost if you didn\u2019t spend some time exploring the place earlier on. Head to the northwest section of the city. Use the map on the upper right of the screen to navigate until you see the huge building, then enter the portal in the front of the large doors. You can also take the portal to the church instead. It\u2019s found in the Trade District, just directly east of the fountain. It\u2019s a circle on the ground with a glowing gold symbol floating above it, and if you\u2019re close enough, it has the label \u201cPortal to Church.\u201d"
    },
    {
      "headline":"Speak with the Bishop.",
      "description":"Report to the Bishop to fulfill the Quest conditions. After receiving the reward, you get to read some more exposition about the story and the setting of Aura Kingdom. He\u2019ll then prompt you to head to Andre."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Head to the Military Hall.",
      "description":"It\u2019s the huge courtyard around east of the church, and when you enter it, you\u2019ll see loads of knight NPCs training in the grounds. Look north from the gate, and you\u2019ll see a huge building, a wide set of stairs, and a quest marker! Go up the stairs, and get hit by a wave of familiarity as you speak to Andre, the lead Templar himself!"
    },
    {
      "headline":"Speak to Andre.",
      "description":"He\u2019ll say some admittedly unflattering things about you, but after a while, you both get into the meat of the conversation: training you to wield a secondary weapon, otherwise known as a Subclass! A short cutscene will trigger afterwards, but when that\u2019s over, you can finally get yourself a Subclass!"
    },
    {
      "headline":"Select your class.",
      "description":"You have free choice between the classes, but certain classes have skills for you to unlock with your main class. For Guardian, you can find the Duelist (Dual Blades), Ranger (Bow), and Ravager (Axe) have some skills you can unlock. They\u2019re unlocked in your Envoy\u2019s Path, so feel free to mess around with it and take the skills you need!"
