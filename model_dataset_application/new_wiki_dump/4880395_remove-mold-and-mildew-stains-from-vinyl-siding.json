      "headline":"Choose the best cleaning solution.",
      "description":"You can try a number of proven DIY and commercial cleaning solutions on your siding. A popular homemade option is to mix three (3) parts distilled white vinegar with seven (7) parts water in a bucket. If you prefer a commercial product, mix one (1) part bleach with four (4) parts water."

    {
      "headline":"Pressure-wash with cleaning solution.",
      "description":"Pour the cleaning solution into a power washer. If you are worried about damaging the vinyl, you may use a lower-pressure pump sprayer. Begin by spraying a 5-foot wide section of the siding, from the ground to the top. Remember not to angle the sprayer upward to keep the solution from seeping under the siding layers. Instead, aim the sprayer in such a way that the solution is sprayed from above. Using a ladder may help you achieve a more even application."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Spray with clean water.",
      "description":"Pour whatever solution remains in the sprayer back in the bucket. Rinse the sprayer and refill it with clean water. Rinse the solution off of the vinyl, starting from the top so the water will run downward."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Repeat.",
      "description":"Do steps 4 to 6 on the next 5-foot portion of your siding. Continue doing this until you have cleaned the entire wall."
