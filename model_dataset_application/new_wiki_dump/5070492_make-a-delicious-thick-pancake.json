      "description":"Use an electric whisk to stir the ingredients as this is both easy, quick and the right technique to get that lovely, airy thickness in your pancake. Place the whisk aside as we will be using it again later. If the mix looks too thin, add a little more flour."

      "headline":"Take out a frying pan.",
      "description":"You can also use a pan intended for making pancakes, which would be even better! With a small ladle, spoon some of your mixture into the pan. It is hard to say how much you want in because people have certain preferences on their pancake-size, so do it to whatever size you want. For a medium-sized THICK pancake, cook for about one minute on one side and a little bit less on the other side. Add and take some time from the cooking depending on your pancake-size and thickness. Both sides should be a light golden brown."

      "headline":"Once you have used up all your pancake batter, you can now spread whatever you want on it.",
      "description":"You can stick to butter and jam or use maple syrup or a coulis of some sort. You can even chop up some bananas or strawberries to put on top. The decision is up to you. After you have done this, there is only one thing left to do... eat it!"
