      "headline":"Take him everywhere.",
      "description":"Are you going to the mall with your friends? Great, take him with you. Your friends may laugh but your good friends may be nice and then become your teddy's \"auntie\". If you are going to have dinner, take him to the table and place some pillows under him so he can see over the table."
