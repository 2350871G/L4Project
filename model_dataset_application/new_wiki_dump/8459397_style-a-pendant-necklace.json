          "description":"In general, pendants tend to work better on taller people. If you're below 5'4\", a pendant may look overwhelming. If you are on the shorter side, opt for a pendant necklace that sits above your collar bone. This way, it will add a touch of decoration to your outfit without overwhelming you. People of average or tall height can generally get away with a variety of different necklace sizes. If you want a longer pendant, one that goes below your collar bone, this can be flattering if you're average height or tall. The size of the pendant itself does not make a big difference depending on height."

          "headline":"Evaluate your face type.",
          "description":"Different styles go better with round, oval, or heart-shaped faces. Look in a mirror and see if your face forms a circle, oval, or heart. Use this to decide which type of pendant would work best with you. Opt for a longer pendant if you have a round face, preferably one with a heavier charm. This will tug the chain downward, creating a v-effect. Rounder faces would benefit from slightly shorter chains and lighter pendants. You want the chain to be rounded slightly to match your face. If you have an oval face, you can wear any type of pendant."

          "headline":"Look at your neck.",
          "description":"Shorter necks, or necks with lots of wrinkles, benefit from longer chains. Opt for a pendant necklace between 20 and 24 inches in length. Longer necks can generally wear any length of necklace."

          "headline":"Use caution with pendant necklaces if you have a fuller figure.",
          "description":"If you have a fuller figure, a pendant necklace may look awkward. It also may draw unnecessary attention to your chest. Go for a smaller, less noticeable charm if you're fuller figured and want to wear a pendant necklace. For example, opt for a small orb rather than a large, decorative pendant. This may be more subtle, preventing unnecessary attention from being directed at your chest."

          "description":"Pendants usually look good when worn outside t-shirts. Plain t-shirts especially can be spruced up with the presence of a decorative pendant just outside the shirt. This is a simple, minimal look that can be flattering on most people."

          "headline":"Wear a pendant with a v-neck.",
          "description":"Some people prefer a pendant on bare skin. If you prefer this, opt to wear a pendant with a v-neck. Be careful, however, to make sure the chain is not too long. A longer chain may need to be paired with a very low-cut v-neck, or a plunging neckline, to get the desired effect."

          "description":"If you're wearing a solid colored top, especially a darker color, this can go great with orbs or pearls. Opt for pendant necklaces that contain these kinds of jewelry. This will brighten up your outfit by adding a splash of dramatic color. Lighter pearls and orbs may work better on darker tops. For example, you can wear a clear or milky orb with a black turtleneck.

For example, pair a pendant necklace with a choker. However, as pendants can often be flashy, you should choose played down necklaces to pair with them. Go for a solid colored choker, for example, instead of one with a lot of jewels and embellishments."
