In some cases, boiling will return the rubber object to the desired size and shape just by removing any dirt and debris that has collected. If the water is dirty after the rubber is removed, this is likely the case. The boiling point of rubber is much higher than the boiling point of water, but take care that the rubber is not damaged by looking for signs of wear, such as spots melting away or debris floating to the surface."
