          "description":"Physical removal is the best initial treatment for bug infestations. As soon as you notice bugs on your cactus, set your garden hose to a stream setting. Spray down the entire plant to blast off any bugs crawling on the surface.Don\u2019t set the hose so high that it damages the plant. Spray the stream on one spot for a few seconds to make sure the plant doesn\u2019t tear or break off. If not, keep that pressure for the rest of the plant. An early spray with the hose can stop bugs before they infest the plant. Do this treatment every few days to remove potential pests."

If the blast of water doesn\u2019t get rid of them all, take a pair of tweezers and pick each beetle off. Throw them in the trash so they don\u2019t re-infest your plants.Longhorn beetles are most active in the early morning and late evening, the cooler parts of the day. Look for them on your plants during these times. Use thick gloves while checking your plants to protect yourself from the cactus\u2019 spines."

These are sticky strips of paper that attract and catch flying insects. Hang them horizontally close to the soil to deal with a gnat problem.Fungus gnats look like small black mosquitoes. Sticky traps are available at hardware stores or online."

Mix 3 parts rubbing alcohol with 1 part water. Then, dip a cotton swab into that mixture and rub it on any spots that the bugs have colonized.This treatment is best for small infestations of mealybugs and scale insects. Both attach themselves to the cactus in small colonies. Some cacti are sensitive to alcohol. Treat a small spot first and let it sit for a day. If you see any discoloration or drying out, then don't use alcohol on your cactus."

Repeat the treatment until the infestation is gone.Soaps are most useful for smaller insects like mites, which are hard to remove physically. Most insecticidal soaps instruct you to dilute the product in a spray bottle with water before applying it. Check that any product you use is safe for use on cacti.

Follow the application directions on the product and continue application until the infestation is gone.Mealybugs are about \u20443 inch (0.85 cm) long and have a cotton-like appearance. The signs of a mealybug infestation are lines of shiny slime that may develop black mold. You can also use insecticides for other insects besides mealybugs. Any bug infestation that won\u2019t go away needs pesticide treatment. Test the insecticide on a small part of one plant to make sure it\u2019s safe.

This step will prevent the bugs from spreading throughout your whole garden.Wear gloves while removing a cactus so you don\u2019t injure yourself.
