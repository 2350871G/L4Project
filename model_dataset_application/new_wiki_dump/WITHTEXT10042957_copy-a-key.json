Once the key is charred on one side, set it down until it is cool to the touch. Use a pair of pliers to hold the key so you don\u2019t burn your fingers."

          "description":"Cut a piece of clear tape the same length as the key. Standard sized clear tape should work for most house keys. Carefully lay it on top of the key so it doesn\u2019t crease. Press the tape firmly onto the blackened side of the key so the char transfers. The outline of the key will transfer to the sticky side of the tape. Leave a fingertip-sized bit of tape at the end of the key so it\u2019s easier to remove."

          "description":"Peel the tape back, being sure that it doesn\u2019t fold or crease. The char will leave residue on the sticky side of the tape in the same shape as the key. Use rubbing alcohol to remove any residual char from the key."

          "description":"A standard thickness card will work best. Stick the tape so the entire imprint of the key is on the card. Make sure the tape lays flat so the shape of the teeth is not distorted. Be sure to place the tape away from any raised letters or numbers on the card otherwise it will be too thick to fit in the lock. Use a light-colored card so you can easily see the imprint of the key."

If the teeth are not close to the correct size, they will not be able to turn the lock. It doesn\u2019t matter how the large end of the key is shaped. As long as the teeth are cut correctly, the key should work. Hold the original key up to the one you\u2019re cutting out to compare the teeth."
