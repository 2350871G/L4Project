          "description":"Maybe you want to sort them by fabric type, such as silks, denims, cottons, flannels, etc. You can also choose to sort the fabric by color, pattern, or print design. For example, group all of the polka dot fabric together, or all of the fabric with a floral design. You can color-code your fabric by shades, such as starting with green and then moving on to turquoise, light blue, blue, and navy. Consider grouping all of your holiday-themed fabrics together."

          "headline":"Cut your fabrics into usable sizes and shapes.",
          "description":"If you have fabric that has shapes cut out of it or unusable scraps attached, cut these off. This will make folding your fabric much easier and your fabric will be ready to use once you pull it out. You can set aside any scraps that you\u2019d like to use and store them with other scraps. Use fabric scissors to cut the fabric, or scissors sharp enough to cut through the fabric without causing the edges to fray."

          "description":"This makes your fabrics much more visually appealing if they\u2019re being displayed, as well as easier to sort through if they\u2019re hidden away. Decide how wide and long you\u2019d like your fabric to be when folded, and use a ruler to help you measure and fold each piece. The ruler is especially helpful for making sharp, even folds. Place the ruler on the inside of the fabric, and then fold over the ruler, pulling the fabric until it's taut against the ruler."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a swatch system to help you keep track of your fabrics.",
          "description":"Cut out 1-inch (2.5 cm) squares of fabric and attach them to paper swatches. You can attach the swatches to a ribbon or chain, and you\u2019ll be able to sort through your fabrics easily to see which ones you have. You can write down where the fabric is located, such as in which drawer or box, or how many inches or yards of it you have on the swatch as well."

You can fold your fabrics and place them flat against the tub\u2019s bottom, or you can set them up vertically to peruse the different fabrics easily."

Set up the canvas boxes on a regular shelf that\u2019s roughly 1 foot (30 cm) tall to fit the boxes, or you can purchase a cube shelf that\u2019s designed specifically to hold the canvas cubes. Label each canvas box so that you know what type of fabric is in them. For example, the labels might read \u201cFlorals,\u201d \u201cGingham,\u201d or \u201cSilks.\u201d\nYou could even buy storage cubes in specific colors, such as pink, yellow, and green, and then store your pink, yellow, and green fabrics in a corresponding cube."

Set up the fabric so that it\u2019s positioned vertically instead of horizontally in the drawer \u2014 this will allow you to see all of the different fabrics at once. You could have 1 drawer for all blue fabrics, 1 for all green fabrics, and so on. You can also create a holiday drawer and set up all of your holiday-themed fabrics in 1 drawer for easy access."

You can add labels to the dividers to flip through the file cabinet easily and know where to look for your fabrics. This works well for smaller lengths and quantities of fabric."
