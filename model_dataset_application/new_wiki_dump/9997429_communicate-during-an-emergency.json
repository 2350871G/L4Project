          "description":"If you're preparing for an emergency, charge your cell phone. Purchase a car charger to use once you run out of batteries, especially if the power may go out, and keep a few spare batteries on hand. If you're charging a phone with your car, never turn it on in enclosed place. Use running cars outdoors to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning."

          "headline":"Forward landline calls to your cellphone.",
          "description":"Contact your phone service company to ask about forwarding landline calls to your mobile phone. That way, you'll be more likely to receive all important calls during a power outage. If you can't reach your phone company, you may be able to activate call forwarding online or through your phone's settings."

          "description":"Ask your local authorities about any official emergency text alert services. Sign up for any available alert services to stay updated on breaking news as it happens. Contact your local authorities or police for specific instructions on how to subscribe to their text alerts. Sign up for school district emergency alert services as well if you have children."

          "description":"If you have a non-emergency message during a citywide disaster, send a text message to keep the network lines clear. As long as you have service, your phone should be able to send text messages with no or minor delays. Because most emergency phone numbers do not offer a texting option, call them unless you know your area's emergency services offer a texting option."

Switch to a satellite phone or keep one on hand in case of emergencies where landline or mobile phones may be unavailable. You can buy satellite phones online or from many electronics or outdoor survival stores."

Check your social media daily to receive updates from friends and city authorities. Some social media sites also allow you to \"check in\" and tell loved ones that you are okay following an emergency."

Purchase a radio that receives AM/FM radio signals and is battery, hand crank, or solar-powered. You can buy radios online or from most electronics or outdoor survival stores. Weather radios receive 24/7 forecasts and warnings from the National Weather Service (NWS) and are useful for natural disaster updates."

          "description":"HAM radios are good for communicating with others when phone and Wi-Fi services are down. Keep a HAM radio in your emergency kit and encourage loved ones to do, too, in case of widespread disasters. HAM radios are a specific kind of radio that allows you to talk with others who own a HAM radio through the frequencies. You can buy a HAM radio online or from many electronics stores. Practice turning a HAM radio on, tuning the frequencies, and talking with others beforehand so you know how to communicate with it during emergencies."

Focus your conversation on these needs and how to best resolve them in your current circumstances. If you're talking to a loved one, for example, you will have different things to address than to a government official or a neighbor. An employee's needs, for example, may be what impact the emergency has on their job, how their supervisors will maintain safety, and whether their co-workers are okay."

If someone in your group broke their leg, for example, provide initial first aid and call emergency services."

        {
          "headline":"Stay calm while you communicate.",
          "description":"Emergencies can bring out strong emotions that, while valid, can inhibit your ability to function. Assess the situation and avoid jumping to conclusions or blaming others, especially if these actions are fueled by emotions. Instead, focus on what you can do to help in that moment. If your loved one has a panic attack, for example, try to comfort them calmly and do deep breathing exercises with them until they feel better."

          "headline":"Make an emergency plan before a disaster happens.",
          "description":"If you're the head of a business, family, or other group, hold a meeting to create a plan in case of emergency. Brainstorm potential needs during emergencies, a plan of action during crises, and personal or group assignments for emergency situations. Rehearse the emergency plan during times of non-emergencies so that, if the time comes, those involved will react by following the plan. If you're a business leader, organize a crisis management team for your company and train them in emergency response strategies."
