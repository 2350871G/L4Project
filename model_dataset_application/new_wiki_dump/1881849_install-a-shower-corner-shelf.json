  "text":" Install a Shelf in a Tiled Shower Using Silicone Caulk Purchase a ceramic corner shelf with a flat back at a tile store or a home improvement store.  Clean the corner where you plan to install the shelf using a bathroom cleaner that removes soap scum and thoroughly dry the area before you attach the shelf. If scum or moisture remains on the tile, then the seal for the shelf may fail. Apply double-sided adhesive foam tape to the mounting flanges on the sides of the shelf.  Test the shelf in the corner before you remove the plastic strip to expose the tape\u2019s exterior adhesive. If the shelf is not flush with the corner, then apply an extra layer of adhesive tape on one side until the tape meets the wall. Thickly apply silicone caulk around the perimeter of the sides of the shelf using a squeeze tube of caulk or a caulk gun. The bead does not have to be smooth. Remove the exterior paper backing from the tape.  Place the shelf against the wall in the middle of a row of tile. You want to ensure that no horizontal grout lines run through the caulk. Press the shelf into the corner until the tape grips. Smooth the caulk by inserting your fingertip into the joint and pulling your finger down the caulk line to smooth the seal. Use a damp sponge to wipe away any excess caulk. Allow the silicone caulk to cure for 24 to 48 hours before you use the shower again.  Install a Shelf in a Tiled Shower Using Hardware Clean the shower wall using a cleaner that removes soap scum. Dry the area thoroughly when you are finished cleaning. Choose the location for your corner shelf and hold the shelf against the tile. Use a pencil to mark the locations where the screws will go into the tile, and use a level to make sure that the shelf will not be tilted. Place two layers of masking tape over the pencil marks that you made on the tile. When you drill a hole in the tile, the masking tape will hold the drill bit steady. Put a masonry bit on your drill and slowly drill a hole in the tile through the masking tape. Don\u2019t push too hard as you drill so that the tile doesn\u2019t split or crack. Repeat the process until all of your holes are drilled.  Remove the masking tape.  Insert plastic anchors into the holes.  Screw the shelf into the wall by putting the screws into the plastic anchors using a handheld screwdriver.  Installing a Shelf in a Fiberglass Shower Using Hardware Clean your shower with a cleaner that will eliminate soap scum. Dry the area thoroughly. Place your shelf against the wall and mark the locations of the drill holes with a pencil. Use a level to make sure that your shelf doesn\u2019t tilt. Start by drilling 3/16\u201d holes in the fiberglass using a brad point bit. If your drill bit strikes plywood, then you can insert stainless steel screws into the holes. If your drill does not strike plywood, then drill again to create 3/8\u201d holes. Insert 1/8\u201d toggle bolts into the holes that you drilled.  Run a bead of silicone caulk around the backside of your shelf where the screws will attach to the wall. This will help to reinforce the mounting hardware. Position the shelf about 1\u201d from the wall and insert the screws into the holes, screwing them into the toggles using a handheld screwdriver. Don\u2019t push the hardware against the wall until the screws are securely in the toggles. Otherwise, the toggles will simply spin in the holes. Use a damp sponge to wipe off any excess caulk that squeezes out from behind the shelf. ",
