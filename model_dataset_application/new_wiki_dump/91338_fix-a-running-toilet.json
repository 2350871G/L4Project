          "description":"Before you can check the flapper for problems, turn off the water to the toilet. Flush the toilet to drain excess water from the tank. This will allow you to inspect the flapper without having the toilet running constantly. The flapper is a round rubber seal that stops water from draining from the tank and into the toilet bowl. When you flush the toilet, the chain pulls the flapper up so fresh water can fill the bowl. Problems with the flapper are among the most common causes of a running toilet."

When the chain is too short, it will pull up on the valve when it shouldn\u2019t, allowing water to drain constantly. When the chain is too long, it can get caught underneath the flapper and prevent a seal. If there's too much tension on the chain, remove the hook attaching the chain to the flush lever. Move the hook up 1 or 2 links until the chain has more slack. Reattach the hook to the flush lever. If the chain is so long that it can get caught under the valve, use a pair of wire cutters to trim a few links from the top of the chain.

Alternatively, put a few drops of baby shampoo on a rag and use it to wipe down the flapper. This will clean the flapper and add more elasticity to the rubber.
