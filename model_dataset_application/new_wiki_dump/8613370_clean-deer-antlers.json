Once it boils, submerge the entire antler in the cooking pot and allow to boil for 30 minutes. This step is important for removing dangerous bacteria from the antlers. You should boil the antlers outside, otherwise they will stink up your house. Before beginning, test to see if the cooking pot is large enough to fit the antlers inside. All of the antlers should be submerged during boiling. If you don\u2019t have any pots large enough, you can try using prongs to force them underwater or adjust them periodically during the boiling process."
