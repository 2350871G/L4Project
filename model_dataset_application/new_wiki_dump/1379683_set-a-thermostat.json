The fan will run for as long as the \u201con\u201d option is engaged. The \u201cauto\u201d option will only engage the fan when either the heat or air conditioning turns on and needs to be circulated. The \u201con\u201d option for the fan is generally considered an energy waster since it will require a decent amount of energy to move that much air on a constant basis. Due to this most people only ever leave the fan set to \u201cauto.\u201d\nMany people use the \u201con\u201d option simply to flush air out of a house\u2014if something burned while cooking and you want to circulate enough air to clear the smell, for instance."

You can prep the system to cool the home by moving the switch or pressing the button until you reach the \u201ccool\u201d setting. You will see a number on the thermostat display. This number is the ambient temperature in your home. Use the up and down arrows on the thermostat to set the temperature you want the home to reach. You will see a different display number come up that corresponds to the temperature you set. You will likely hear the system click as it engages and turns on the air conditioning to lower the temperature in the house to what you have set. The system will run until the house reaches the chosen temperature, and then it will automatically turn itself off and only reengage when the internal thermometer registers that the home is warmer than the set temperature. You can use the same switch or button to cycle the system to \u201coff\u201d at any time."

Again, the system will only run when the internal thermometer registers that the ambient room temperature is colder than the set temperature. You may also see an \u201cEM heat\u201d or \u201cemergency heat\u201d setting on your thermostat, especially if you live in an area prone to bitter cold conditions. This setting corresponds to a separate electric heating unit in the home in the event that the larger system breaks or freezes over during winter. While it does not hurt to test the emergency heating option periodically, you should stick to the standard heat setting for day-to-day use."
