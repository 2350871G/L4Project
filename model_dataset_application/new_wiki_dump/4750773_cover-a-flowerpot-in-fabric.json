It's a lot more neutral to have white bounce back than terracotta orange! Paint the saucer as well.  Allow to dry completely before proceeding.  Cutting the fabric Cut the fabric. Measure the fabric against the chosen flowerpot. The fabric needs to be large enough to cover the outside of the pot, as well as having enough to cover the base of the flowerpot and about 1.5 inches/2cm to wrap over the rim. Cut fabric for the saucer dish as well.  Adding the fabric to the flowerpot Sponge Mod Podge over one section of the flowerpot. Decide which direction you'll work in; the important thing is to go in sections and keep working around the flowerpot in the same direction. Work efficiently. Mod Podge will dry quickly, so the fabric needs to be attached quickly. This is why it is best to work in sections. Add Mod Podge to the fabric as well, this will help ensure even coverage. Attach the first part of the fabric to the Mod Podge section. Smooth out to prevent wrinkles. Add more Mod Podge to another section. Add the next part of the fabric.

Place on something like a plastic envelope folder or a sheet of wax paper, so that it doesn't stick to anything. Do the same thing to over the saucer.  Using the fabric covered flowerpot Place small glass jars inside the flowerpot before adding water for live displays. A fabric-covered flowerpot is best used as a vase display decoration, as it won't get dirty from adding soil. If using to grow plants, add soil and the plant.
