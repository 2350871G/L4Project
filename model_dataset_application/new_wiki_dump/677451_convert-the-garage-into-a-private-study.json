      "description":"Remove everything and make a decision on whether or not you need to keep it. For the items that you keep, you will need to make a decision about where these will go. Do you have a garden shed, or perhaps the items can go in the basement? Alternately, the garage items can remain in the garage but purchase or build better storage facilities that hide the items away from site."

      "headline":"Lay garage carpet on the entire garage floor.",
      "description":"This carpet is especially adapted to take the weight of cars and spillages too. It's hardy but also decent to look at and comfortable to walk on. It is also ideal for study furniture, as it is firm enough to roll on a wheelchair at a desk."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Design the study layout.",
      "description":"At the minimum, add a desk, some shelves for books, a chair for studying from, and good lighting. Other additions might include bookcases, filing cabinet, printer stand, etc. When designing the layout, decide whether you must leave space for the car(s) still or whether you have a much larger space to work with. If you are still letting the cars live in the garage, try to create a barrier between your study space and the cars, such as a movable wall partition, a concertina sliding and folding accordion room divider, or opaque glass wall sliding screens. That way, you will maintain your privacy and sense of homeliness at nighttime when the cars will usually be inside the garage."

      "headline":"Consider changing the garage doors to ones that let in light, such as all glass folding doors, doors with large windows, etc.",
      "description":"This will immediately brighten up the study space and make it feel a lot more pleasant. It will also open up the look of your entire home if the garage forms a part of the house. Get some advice from an architect or interior designer on the options available."

      "headline":"Have the wiring and cables fixed.",
