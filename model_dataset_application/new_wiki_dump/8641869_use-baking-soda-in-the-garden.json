          "description":"Wet your soil a bit with distilled water. Sprinkle a handful of baking soda over the damp soil. If it begins to bubble, your soil is acidic, meaning its pH is below 5, and will not be able to support healthy plant growth. If your soil is acidic, you can raise its pH level by mixing ground or powdered lime into the soil. Over time, your soil will become more alkaline. Wood ashes and oyster shell might also help. Search online to find out what pH level the plants you plan on growing require before you make any changes to the soil."

Spray it on or near plants you suspect could be at risk for fungal diseases, especially, for instance, roses and grapes. If you have a problem with mildew on your plants, mix one teaspoon baking soda, one quart (one liter) water, and a few drops of liquid soap. Pour this mixture into a spray bottle.
