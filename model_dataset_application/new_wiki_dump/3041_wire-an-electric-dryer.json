Most hardware stores and nearly all home supply centers offer cord sets for electric ranges and dryers with a choice of either 3 or 4 conductors for under $25 or so. These cord sets may look similar, but are not interchangeable due to different electrical ratings. Dryer cord sets are 240V/30A and range cord sets are 240V/40A for use in the U.S. & Canada."

The center wire of this cable is the neutral wire and the outer wires are the \"hot\" line 1 and line 2 wires. These hot wires connect to the outer 2 connections the power terminal block of the dryer, does not matter which is which as long as one hot is connected to each of the outer terminal connectors."
