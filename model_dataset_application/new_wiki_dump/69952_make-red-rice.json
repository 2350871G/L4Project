Turn the burner to medium-high, and allow the oil to heat until it\u2019s hot or starts to shimmer, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. You can substitute vegetable oil for the canola oil if you prefer."

Cook the mixture on medium-high until it\u2019s soft, which should take approximately 4 minutes.
