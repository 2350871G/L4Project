However, the same testing revealed that 300 out of 300 packages of ground beef of all types contained at least one potentially harmful bacteria. No matter how it is raised, prepared, packaged, or stored, all beef contains bacteria, and some of it can potentially harm you.

Bring a cooler to store your purchased raw beef if you cannot refrigerate it within an hour or so of purchasing it. Bacteria of all types thrive in temperatures ranging between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (4-60 degrees Celsius).

Place meat packages into individual plastic bags (such as the rolled produce bags found in supermarkets) before placing them into your cart. Wash or sanitize your hands after handling the package, if possible. Separate meat packages into their own bag(s) when checking out. Take extra care if you utilize reusable shopping bags \u2014 double bag your meat packages in plastic first. Isolate raw meat in your home refrigerator as well.

If you need to thaw it faster, place it in a container of cold water in the sink, and change the water every half hour or so. Thawing in the microwave is another option. Do not just let frozen (or refrigerated) meat sit on the counter. Serve cooked beef while it is still hot, and refrigerate any leftovers before they get to room temperature. Never let beef sit out for more than two hours, and never more than one hour at between 90 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (32-60 C) \u2014 this is the extreme danger zone within the \u201cdanger zone.\u201d"

Immediately after handling raw meat, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with warm water and soap. Turn on the faucet before handling the meat, or use your elbows instead of your contaminated hands. Wash any utensil or preparation surface that comes in contact with raw beef with soap and hot water. For example, don\u2019t put raw burgers on a tray, cook them on the grill, then return them to the same tray without thoroughly cleaning it first. Take special care with cutting boards. Whenever possible, dedicate a separate cutting board to meats. Wash the used board immediately, and consider sanitizing it with a solution of one teaspoon of bleach to one quart of hot water. Discard well-used, rutted cutting boards (or sand down wooden ones); ruts offer ample hiding places for bacteria."

High temperatures are the surest \u2014 and really, only \u2014 way to kill bacteria in beef. Cook steaks, roasts, chops, etc. to an internal temperature (based on a probe placed into the center of the thickest part of the meat) of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 C). Let the meat rest for three minutes or more before serving. Cook ground beef to an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees F (71 C). Bacteria tend to collect on the surface of meats, so ground beef is a greater risk (and thus requires a higher cooking temperature) because the grinding process spreads any surface bacteria throughout. Reheat any type of cooked, refrigerated beef to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 C). Test several spots if using a microwave, since the heating can be quite uneven."
