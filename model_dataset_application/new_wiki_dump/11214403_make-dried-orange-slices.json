          "description":"Consider the stem side the \u201cNorth Pole\u201d of the orange and orient it so it\u2019s on its side. Carefully use a sharp kitchen knife to create even slices. Discard the first and last slices (the \u201cNorth\u201d and \u201cSouth Poles\u201d). For the best results, use ripe (but not over-ripe) oranges without bruises or blemishes."

          "description":"Lay all the cut slices on a plate or tray, then dab them with a paper towel to soak up any surface moisture. Turn the slices over and repeat the process with another clean paper towel. This step isn\u2019t absolutely necessary, but it will help the slices to dry out faster. Use plain white paper towels. Decorated paper towels can sometimes transfer colored spots onto the slices."

          "headline":"Spike the cut slices with cloves to make decorations.",
          "description":"Use a knife tip to cut a small hole through each fresh orange slice, just inside the rings of pith and skin, so you can loop a string through each opening after the slices are dried. Press a clove, star side up, into the center of each orange slice. Then, if desired, create a ring of cloves around the inside perimeter of the slice. After the slices are dried, simply tie a colorful yarn or string through the hole in each slice so you can hang them. Dried orange slices decorated with cloves are a traditional Christmas tree and wreath ornament in the UK. You can skip the cloves if desired."

          "description":"Lay the fresh slices on a plate or tray, then sprinkle them with white sugar, brown sugar, or coconut sugar. Follow up with a dusting of cinnamon, ginger, or both. Or, try other spice combinations until you find your favorite! Once dried, the seasoned slices make a great snack or dessert garnish. If you want to use a slice as a drink garnish, cut a line in a fresh slice from the center through the skin on its perimeter. This will become a small wedge-shaped cutout once the slice is dried. Use seedless oranges for snacking, or pick the seeds out of the slices before drying them."

          "description":"If your oven does not permit a setting this low, put it as low as it will go. At 65 \u00b0C (149 \u00b0F), it will usually take about 3.5-4.5 hours to dry the orange slices. At 95 \u00b0C (203 \u00b0F), it will typically take 2.5-3.5 hours. At 120 \u00b0C (248 \u00b0F), expect it to take 2-3 hours. Even though it takes longer, aim for the lowest temperature you can. This greatly reduces the chances of burning the slices instead of drying them."

Spacing the slices out on a wire rack improves the air flow and decreases the drying time. Using a baking sheet may increase the drying time by up to double. If you do choose to use a baking sheet, line it with parchment paper so the slices don\u2019t stick."
