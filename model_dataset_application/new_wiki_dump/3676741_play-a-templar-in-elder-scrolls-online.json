Good weapons for this style of gameplay include two-handed and sword and shield. Points should be distributed mainly into magicka and stamina, but it will be important to have some points distributed into health as well, since your character will see some action."

Templars have many abilities which allow them to play the very crucial role of keeping everyone alive through a battle. If you want to do this style of gameplay, you'll want to focus on the skills in the Restoring Light tree, though you can also pick up some of the others in order to defend yourself. A restoration staff will of course be a must have for this class, but you can also build your skills in another weapon as well, in order to maintain a basic ability to protect yourself. Almost all of your points should be going in to your magicka. Since there are a few spells which let you heal yourself as well, having a higher health will be much less of a concern and you should be doing very little attacking, making stamina a very minor concern."
