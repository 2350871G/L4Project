          "description":"These items are generally inexpensive, but can make a big difference to the way that a room feels. Consider purchasing matching curtains and lampshades to give the room a sense of cohesiveness. Purchase the items new or look in second-hand shops for a bargain. If you\u2019re a confident sewer, consider making your own curtains to save money. This is a great way to quickly freshen up an office, lounge, or bedroom. Paint or cover up your lampshades for a new look for less money."

          "description":"Minimalism is a classy and popular look that is easy to achieve. Re-home as many items as you can from all your surfaces, such as desks, countertops, tables, and shelves. Leave only a few of your favourite items on each surface. Decluttering is a great way to bring more attention to the items that you love. For example, remove everything from your office desk except for your pen jar, a photo-frame, and a vase of flowers to create a clean and fresh look. Try taking items off of your coffee table and only include items that look nice or that are functional."

Place these items on your bed, lounge-suite, office chair, or ottoman. If you are decorating your entire home, consider purchasing matching pillows for both your lounge and your bedroom. Purchase pillows or throws from a homeware store or make your own. Buy pillow covers or fabric to cover existing pillows for a fraction of the cost of new ones."

Consider adding new accessories, such as placemats, door handles, light-fittings, tapware, tablecloths, vases, and coasters. If your budget is particularly limited, simply decorate one room at a time. This will give you a sense of completion as you finish each room. Get a few houseplants to improve the quality of the air in your home and add fresh looking d\u00e9cor touches."

Bring a new standing lamp into the room, add a hanging light, pick a new desk lamp, or simply replace a bulb with a high-wattage option to brighten the space. Avoid tampering with electrical wires in your home or office, as this can lead to electrocution. If you want to install new lights into your wall, hire an electrician to do the job safely. String lights are also a nice way to add mood lighting to an area."

Consider building your own deck, laying wallpaper, installing vinyl or hardwood flooring, or painting the exterior of your home. This can often save you 100\u2019s if not 1000\u2019s of dollars. Search online for DIY tutorials for almost any type of project. Ask professionals at a hardware store for tips as well."

Make sure to hunt around for furniture that is made from quality materials, as it pointless buying items that will quickly wear out or break. Opt for solid wood instead of laminate coatings and real leather instead of leather look-alikes. Keep an eye out in your local paper for garage sales. Search online for auction sites, such as Craigslist, eBay, and Gumtree. These sites often have furniture for sale. Check to see if people in your area are selling items. If they are, you may be able to negotiate a great price on something that you can pick up right in your neighborhood."

If the furniture has fabric, reupholster it or purchase new cushions. This will help to give it a fresh new look. Sanding wooden tables and desks and painting them white is a popular decorating trend. Search online for DIY tutorials to help you complete your refurbishments."

Ask the manufacturer what kind of stain or varnish they recommend to use on the furniture. Apply the stain with even brush strokes and apply at least 2 coats. This furniture is often higher quality than display models, as scratches can\u2019t be hidden by varnish. Desks and tables are easy items to stain yourself. The display piece in furniture stores is often an unfinished piece that you can buy for less."

Large furniture stores will often slash their prices by up to 75% during these sales. Also, keep an eye out for closing down and birthday sales for extra deals throughout the year. If you are willing to be patient, this is a great way to find furniture that you love that is within your budget. Search online for sales in your area to quickly check the local deals."
