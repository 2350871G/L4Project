          "description":"Sparkling water has become a very popular soda replacement over the last few years. Sales have nearly doubled in the US of sparkling waters, seltzer and even tonic water. Try replacing your favorite soda with sparkling water instead. Plain, unflavored sparkling water is a great alternative to sodas. It's naturally sugar-free, calorie-free and can help keep you hydrated during the day. There are flavored sparkling waters available as well. Always read the nutrition label to make sure they do not have any added sugars or sodium to them. If they are zero calories, but flavored, they may still have added artificial sweeteners. If you're OK with consuming artificial sweeteners, these sugar-free flavored beverages are a great alternative. Sparkling water should be OK for most people; however, health professionals note that if you suffer from IBS or chronic bloating, sparkling water can increase feelings of bloating."

          "description":"Another great option for soda lovers is to make your own sodas at home. You can purchase all-natural ingredients and make flavorful sparkling beverages that are the perfect soda replacement. If you really crave a flavored, bubbly beverage, consider mixing together either tonic, seltzer or sparkling water with your favorite fruit juice. Fruit juice contains a lot of sugar (even 100% fruit juice), so limit your intake to 4 oz. Make sure to choose 100% fruit juice. Fruit juice cocktails or fruit juice mixes may have added sugar to them and will be much higher in calories. To keep total calories and sugar low overall, only mix in about 1/4 cup 100% fruit juice in with about 8 \u2013 10 oz of sparkling water."

These little machines can be convenient and help you make more nutritious beverages right in your own home. There are many different brands of soda makers for home use. They require a carbonation capsule and specialty bottles; however, you just use regular tap or bottled water for your sodas. Most of the companies sell soda-flavored syrups and other flavorings to make your sodas, though you may wish to avoid these, as they may be loaded with sugar and other artificial sweeteners. Be careful of what you buy as some are still full of chemicals like \"caramel coloring\" or high fructose corn syrup. There are some brands of these syrups that are all-natural and do not contain any artificial sweeteners, preservatives or flavorings. You can also just use your soda machine to make homemade carbonated water. Then you can use it along with 100% fruit juice or homemade simple syrups to make flavored beverages."

Sparkling iced tea is just like soda; however, instead of a sugar syrups and other additives, it's just iced tea that has been carbonated. If you do purchase a sparkling iced tea in the grocery store, make sure to read the food label. Some may have added sugar \u2014 like a sweetened tea would \u2014 where others are unsweetened and do not have any added sugars. If you want to make sparkling iced tea at home, you can try steeping tea bags in carbonated water. Make sure after placing your tea bags in the sparkling water, you reseal it to keep it from going flat. You can also brew cold unsweetened iced tea and use that in your soda maker as well to make it carbonated."

Water doesn't really taste like much; however, if you get creative and spike or infuse your water with flavor, these can be a great and nutritious alternative to sodas. Infuse your water with fruit, vegetables or herbs. This allows natural flavors and even some vitamins to seep into your water. Leave a pitcher of water in the fridge with your favorite sliced fruits or herbs. For example, you can mix together sliced strawberries and basil or cucumbers and mint. It gives your water a hint of flavor without any added sugars or calories. You may also consider adding some of those powdered or liquid flavoring agents. These typically do have artificial sweeteners, but do not contain any added sugars or calories. If you're OK using some artificial sweeteners, these may be a good option as well."

Although caffeinated coffee is something you shouldn't drink unlimited amounts of, decaf coffee is a great and flavorful alternative to sodas. Coffee has natural compounds and antioxidants that have been shown to lower depression and even help prevent cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Like coffee, tea (especially green) has been associated with some great health benefits \u2014 like cancer, diabetes and heart disease prevention. As long as tea and coffee are served decaffeinated and without any added sugars, both are great alternatives to sodas."

Studies have shown that milk is actually about 87% water. If you're not in the mood for plain water and need to limit soda, you might enjoy a glass of milk instead. In addition to being a good source of water, milk is also high in protein, calcium, Vitamin D, phosphorus, potassium and Vitamin A. There's been some back and forth between the types of milk you should drink. If you're watching calories, a lower fat milk will be the lowest calorie choice."

Kombucha has had many positive health effects associated with it. A few studies show that it has antioxidants in it as well as probiotics (which are great for your digestion). Try looking for kombucha in your local grocery store or in a health food store. Kombucha does have added sugar in it (to help the yeast and bacteria ferment), so it contains calories; however, it's usually a natural form of sugar and not an artificial sweetener or high fructose corn syrup."

It's important to aim to be hydrated everyday. Most health professionals recommend that you consume a minimum of eight glasses (64 oz or 1.9 L) of clear fluids daily; however, this is just a general guideline. Some people may need more or less fluid. For example, if you're active, you may  need up to 10 or 12 glasses (2.4 or 96 L) of water a day. Or if you're pregnant, you may need at least 10 glasses (2.4 L) of water daily. Also, only certain types of fluids will count towards your eight or 10 glasses.

If you truly enjoy soda, having it every once in awhile hasn't been proven to be harmful. If you want to include some soda in your diet, decide whether or not you want to drink regular or diet soda. Regular soda has added calories and sugars, and diet soda has no calories, but does have artificial sweeteners. Pick whichever one fits into your diet plan most successfully. Also decide what moderation is for you. Is it one soda a week? Or is it just a few times a month? Stick to whatever definition of moderation you decide."
