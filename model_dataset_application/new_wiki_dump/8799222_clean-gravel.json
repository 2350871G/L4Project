  "text":" Rinsing the Gravel Drill holes into an old wheelbarrow. Use an electric drill and an eight-inch drill bit to do this. Drill holes into the bottom of the wheelbarrow, as well as the sides (about three to four inches up the sides). Drill as many holes as you can to turn your wheelbarrow into a strainer. If you do not have an electric drill, you can rent one from your local hardware store. Shovel the gravel into the wheelbarrow. Only fill a quarter of the wheelbarrow with gravel.
