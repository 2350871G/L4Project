          "description":"If you are using your fireplace or woodstove most days, then you should clean the glass once a week to maintain it. Using poor, unseasoned, damp, or soft wood could require an extra cleaning, however, because they cause soot to build up faster. If you are not using your fireplace or woodstove often, then you may be able to go longer between cleanings."

          "description":"Stubborn black soot stains that bake onto fireplace or woodstove glass can be very difficult to remove. But hot fires will help loosen the stains from the glass and make them easier to remove with cleaning\nBefore cleaning your glass, burn one or two hot fires in your fireplace or woodstove to loosen up the soot and dirt that\u2019s built up on the glass. Alternatively, you could burn a creosote removal product or add a few big spoonfuls of 'Red Devil Lye' to the fire box to help soften and reduce the buildup."

          "headline":"Let the glass cool.",
          "description":"You should never try to clean a fireplace or woodstove when it\u2019s hot, and this applies to the glass as well. You could burn yourself or crack the glass if you're not careful. To be safe, let the stove or fireplace cool for at least 6 to 8 hours before trying to clean it. If you can, wait a couple of days. You should check the temperature before trying to touch it."

          "headline":"Wipe away haze buildup.",
          "description":"For fireplace and woodstove glass that\u2019s relatively clean and well-maintained, you may just have to wipe away a thin layer of haze from the glass. Soak a microfiber cloth or paper towel with water. Wring out the excess, and wipe the inside of the glass with the damp cloth. You could also use old newspaper for the first wipe down to clear away some of the haze. Make sure to wear gloves while you clean the stove, whether they are reusable or disposable. This will be sufficient to remove the white or grayish haze that can build up on glass from the heat, smoke, and ash. If your glass is still dirty after a quick wipe, continue with the cleaning process."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Remove dirt and soot buildup with ashes.",
          "description":"Take some fine white ashes from the fireplace or woodstove. Place the ashes into a bowl and add a few drops of water. Stir the ash and water mixture into a paste, adding more water if necessary. Dip a microfiber cloth into the ash paste and scrub the glass in a circular motion. Add more ash paste to the cloth as necessary, and keep rubbing until you\u2019ve removed the soot. Rinse the cloth with water, wring it out, and wipe the glass with the clean cloth. You can also use newspaper to clean the glass instead of a cloth. Wood ashes have a high pH and contain calcium carbonate, which is why they're so great for cleaning soot from glass."

          "headline":"Remove brown stains with cleaner.",
          "description":"Brown stains sometimes build up on the glass because of the carbon in the fire. To remove stubborn brown stains, spray woodstove glass cleaner on the window and let it sit for 30 minutes. After soaking, wipe the glass with a damp microfiber cloth to remove stains and excess cleaner. You can also use this cleaner and the same method to clean the outside of the glass if it\u2019s dirty. Avoid ammonia-based cleaners on woodstove and fireplace glass. These can leave rainbow streaks on the glass, and many glass manufacturers don\u2019t recommend using them."

When you're burning regular fires, clean the glass each week with an ash paste:\nWhen the fireplace or woodstove has had a day or two to cool, gather some ashes.

To remove this, mix one part vinegar with three parts water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution onto the glass and wipe the glass with a dry microfiber cloth until the glass is dry.
