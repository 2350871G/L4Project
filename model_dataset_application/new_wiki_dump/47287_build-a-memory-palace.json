If you need to remember things in a certain order, follow a specific route through your palace, both in the real world and in your mind.

You\u2019ll store each piece of data in a separate location so you need to identify as many locations as you have data. Each storage spot needs to be unique so that you don\u2019t accidentally mistake one spot for another. If your palace itself is a route, like your drive to work, choose landmarks along the way. Some examples include your neighbor\u2019s house, a traffic light, a statue, or a building. If your palace is a structure, consider separating information in different rooms.
