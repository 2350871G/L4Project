Investigate the plant and if the spike and leaves still look healthy, it's possible to rebloom. Depending on your type of orchid, leaves could fall off during dormancy too. In this case, inspect the stalk and make sure it's still healthy. Signs that an orchid is dead or dying include a yellowing stalk, and dark spots and signs of withering on the leaves."
