  "text":" Keeping Kale Chips Crispy Dry the kale thoroughly before making your chips. The key to keeping kale chips crispy is to make sure your leaves are totally dry before you prepare them. Use a salad spinner or thoroughly pat them dry with paper towels after washing them. Remove the stems before preparing your chips. Kale stems contain lots of moisture, don\u2019t crisp well, and could make your chips soggy when you store them. Snip the stems off and just use the leaves to make your chips. Don\u2019t dress your entire batch of kale with liquid. When you bake your chips, just use cooking spray or toss your leaves with a small amount of oil. If you want to flavor your chips after baking, dress smaller servings with vinegar, more oil, or cheese.

Create an even layer of leaves and avoid bunching them. If necessary, bake them in multiple batches. If the leaves are piled on top of each other, they might steam and get soggy. Storing Kale Chips Properly Make sure the chips are completely cool before storing them. If the chips are any warmer than room temperature, they\u2019ll steam once you pop them in a storage container. That excess heat will leave you with soggy chips. Store your chips in an airtight container for up to a week. Plain kale chips are best stored in an airtight container at room temperature. They\u2019ll keep for up to a week, but try to enjoy them within a couple days. Vacuum sealable glass containers are a great option. However, avoid vacuum seal bags, which will crush your chips.

However, they do go stale, or lose their crunch, and can get soggy to the point of no return. You can revive properly stored kale chips by reheating them, but they won't be salvageable after 5 to 7 days. Reheating Kale Chips Preheat your oven to 170 \u00b0F (77 \u00b0C). Wait for your oven to preheat before popping in your chips. Reheating your chips at a low temperature will help crisp them back up without charring them. Reheat the amount you want to eat.
