Trading systems and their locations vary depending on the game you\u2019re playing. For older versions of the game, you can trade Pok\u00e9mon with other players using the Game Boy\u2019s cable link connection by going inside a Pok\u00e9mon Center in any town and talking to the receptionist (non-playable character) in charge. For newer generations (fourth generation to present), trading Pok\u00e9mon is done using the Global Trade Stations (GTS). To trade using the GTS, go inside a Pok\u00e9mon Center in any town, and talk to the receptionist (non-playable character) in charge of the system. You can also use Quick Link to trade Pokemon locally with friends. On Pokemon Go, players can trade with registered friends. Regular trades cost both players 100 Stardust. Both players must be within 100 meters of each other to initiate a trade."
