Stack the cards neatly in 1 pile, so that all of the black cards are at the top of the deck and all of the red cards are at the bottom. You can also put the red half on top of the black half.

For example, if the red cards are on the left half of your fanned-out deck, then you know your audience chose a red card if they pull from the left side. If you notice that your audience member is reaching for the middle, subtly shift your hand so they take 1 from the left or right instead.

Keep all of the cards face down the entire time. Fun Ways to Enhance Your Trick\nTap a magic wand on the deck before you pick their card. Wear a magician costume, including a fancy top hat, for the full effect. Take a long time to pick out their card to build suspense. Sprinkle \u201cmagic dust\u201d on the cards.

Make sure you can\u2019t see any edges or corners of the card when you flip your hand over. Place 1 corner of the card against the top of your pinky finger and the opposite corner on your thumb pad. You may need to slightly curve the card into your hand to rest in your palm. The card can be either face down or face up in your hand. Don\u2019t grip too tightly or curl your hand inward too much. Keep it as outstretched as possible. Bow the card out by pressing down with your pinky finger. This will cause the card to arch out away from your hand. Flex your palm slightly outward while you push down with your little finger so the card curves out instead of in. Press gently with your pinky.

The more you practice this position, the faster your muscles will commit it to memory. Only your pinky finger, thumb pad, index finger, and thumb should be touching the card in this position. Flick the card upward, catching it between your thumb and forefinger. Push up against the back of the card with your thumb. As the card flips upwards, pinch your thumb and index finger together quickly to snatch the corner. Open up the rest of your fingers after you flick up the card to enhance the illusion that you pulled it out of thin air. This will take a lot of practice, so be patient!
