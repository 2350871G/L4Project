The crickets will walk over the trap and get stuck. Placing a bit of cornmeal in the center of each trap will help attract the crickets to the traps."

The crickets will be attracted to the beer and will crawl in the beer to get to the drops left inside, and get stuck inside. If you like to fish, you can take the crickets you\u2019ve caught and use them as fish bait. Alternatively, you can cut the can open outside and release the crickets if you want to."

          "headline":"Make a molasses trap.",
          "description":"This method will allow you to catch crickets without purchasing commercial sticky traps. Take a clean glass jar and place a generous spoonful inside the jar. Add a bit of water to make the molasses just a bit more runny. Place the open jar in the area where you have heard/seen crickets. The crickets will be attracted to the molasses, and will jump into the jar to get to it. The stickiness of the molasses will make it difficult for the crickets to escape. Be sure to clean out the jar regularly."

If you have a problem with insects in your home, purchasing a can that you can use to kill a cricket (or any bug that finds its way in) is a good idea. Be careful when using a bug spray. After you\u2019ve killed the cricket, dispose of the cricket by using a large wad of toilet paper. Flush the dead cricket down the toilet or throw it in a closed trash can. Clean the area where you\u2019ve sprayed the bug spray with a disinfectant, and wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water."

If you are worried that you may have a cricket infestation, vacuum your home thoroughly, and use the nozzle attachment to vacuum underneath the baseboards all around your home. Hopefully, this will suck up any eggs or crickets that might be hiding. If you have a bagless vacuum cleaner, be sure to empty the contents of the container in a trash can outside your home. If you have a vacuum cleaner with a bag, replace the bag immediately after you finish. Throw away the used bag in a trash can outdoors and away from your home."

Be careful when using pepper spray. It will be painful for you if you get it near your face. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after using the spray."

When you find the cricket, place a glass jar quickly over the top of the cricket so that it is trapped inside. Take a thin (but strong) piece of cardboard (a postcard works well, for example) and slide it underneath the opening of the jar. Now you will have a piece of card that you can keep on the top of the jar while you take it outside. Take the cricket far away from your house. If you just let the cricket out outside your front door, the cricket will probably try to find a way back in."

They are much better at finding insects than humans, so if there is a cricket hiding in your home, let your pet do the hard work. Keep in mind that keeping a pet is a big commitment.

Crickets love moisture, so fixing any problems that may lead to excess moisture will be important. Crickets are also attracted to bright lights, so replace any outdoor lights (e.g. porch lights) with yellow bulbs or sodium vapor bulbs that will be less appealing. Look for any points of entry as well. For example, maybe there is a window that doesn\u2019t seal shut. Check your door frames to make sure that there are no spots that a cricket could get through."

If you are struggling with a cricket infestation, this may be the easiest way to deal with the problem. Make sure that any pest control company you hire is licensed in your state. If you have pets, be sure to let the company know, and ask them if their products are safe for humans, children, and pets."
