          "description":"Sink strainers are always made of metal, but most modern homes have white PVC drain pipes. You\u2019ll find either a PVC or metal coupling nut connecting these two components beneath your sink. Loosen this nut to separate them. You should be able to loosen a PVC nut by hand, turning it counterclockwise. Wrap a towel around the nut to help you get a better grip on it. A metal nut may also require the use of a pipe wrench or large adjustable wrench. If you wish, you may also be able to disconnect the drain pipe at the top of the trap (the U-shaped bend) in order to give yourself more room to work with."

Insert a pair of needle-nose pliers or a sink drain wrench down into the sink and pinch the strainer grate (not the removable strainer basket) to immobilize the entire strainer. You may be able to hold the pliers with one hand and loosen the nut with the other, or you may need to recruit a helper. This would be a good helper job for an older kid or teen. If you have trouble squeezing the pliers, you can also insert the handles of the pliers into the openings of the strainer grate, then stick a screwdriver between the handles and hold it steady to immobilize the sink strainer."

This in turn presses a washer and gasket against the underside of the sink. Most modern sinks have locknut sink strainers. There are also locknut strainers with screw attachments, in which 3 or 4 screws are used to help hold the locknut tight against the underside of the sink. Bell washer sink strainers have an outer bell-shaped \u201cshell\u201d that fits over the entire strainer. This bell housing is pressed against the underside of the sink by a nut located at the bottom of the strainer (just above the nut that connects to the drain pipe below)."

Turn the locknut counterclockwise with the wrench until it spins freely, then turn it by hand until it unthreads and falls off the sink strainer. If the locknut is completely rusted in place and simply will not come off, you can use the cutting wheel attachment on a rotary multi-tool to slice through the locknut, then (if needed) a chisel and mallet to split it apart.
