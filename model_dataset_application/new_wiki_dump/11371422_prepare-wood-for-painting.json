Use painter\u2019s tape to attach the plastic or cloths to another surface, so you don\u2019t damage that surface.

If nails or screws do not need to be replaced, ensure they are all either flush with the surface of the wood, or below the surface of the wood. Try to replace the nails and screws with the same type, size, shape, and colour so the wood surface has a consistent look to it. Make sure to replace old boards or siding with the exact same type of wood."

If possible, use fast-drying wood filler so you don\u2019t have to wait very long before sanding. Check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the exact drying time. Use a metal or plastic putty knife to apply the wood putty/filler."

Check to make sure the caulking you use can be painted. Check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the amount of time it will take for the caulking to dry. Use your finger or a caulk sealing tool to smooth out the caulk after you\u2019ve squeezed it into the cracks or seams."

          "description":"If the wood item has been previously painted or stained, you\u2019ll want to remove any loose or flaky sections. For larger surfaces like wood siding or a deck, you can scrape the old paint or stain off using a wire brush or even a pressure washer. For smaller surfaces like furniture, you can use a scrub brush or a metal scrapper. For decks, you may also want to use paint or stain stripper or remover. When using a chemical stripper or remover, read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the proper way to use it. Ensure you wear the proper protective gear for the work you\u2019re doing. Make sure you scrape the wood in the direction of the grain. For deck boards and wood siding, if you needed to replace any boards, you\u2019ll want to only pressure wash the old boards so they are the same colour as the new boards."

          "description":"Depending on the size of the surface that needs to be sanded, you can use hand-held sandpaper, an electric sander, or even a precision sanding tool (like a Dremel). Start with rougher sandpaper and switch to finer sandpaper as the surface comes closer to being smooth. The purpose of sanding is to even out the surface of the wood and rough up the surface so the primer and paint will be absorbed. If you\u2019ve used wood putty or filler, make sure to sand these areas so they\u2019re flush with the rest of the surface. Always sand in the same direction of the wood grain."

          "description":"Wash the entire wood surface once you\u2019re finished scraping and/or sanding. You want to remove any old paint flakes or dust that\u2019s been left on the surface. For smaller wood items like furniture, wash the wood surface with a gentle scrub brush and mild detergent. For larger items like wood siding, you can use your outdoor hose or a pressure washer at a very light pressure. Pay specific attention to nooks and crannies that are hard to get to. These areas have likely accumulated more dirt and grime over the years. For decks, you\u2019ll want to clean the surface with wood cleaner. You can buy wood cleaner at your local hardware store. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on how to use the cleaner properly."

If you see any black areas on the wood, you\u2019ll want to purchase a specialized product that can be used to ensure the mold and mildew doesn\u2019t spread and can be painted over. You can find specialized products for mold and mildew on wood from your local hardware store.

In order for the primer and paint to be absorbed into the wood properly, mill glaze needs to be removed. Re-sand the areas you\u2019ve found with mill glaze until water no longer beads on top. Newer wood may have mill glaze that is a result of the cutting process. However, older wood may have mill glaze that is a result of not enough paint or stain before removed."

If you\u2019re working outside, you may need to watch the weather forecast and only move to the next step when there are several dry days in a row. Not only do you need the surface to be dry from the cleaning, but it needs to remain dry once the primer, paint, and/or stain has been applied. For wood items drying inside, it might help to speed up the process by making sure the room is well-ventilated and/or there\u2019s a fan blowing in the room."
