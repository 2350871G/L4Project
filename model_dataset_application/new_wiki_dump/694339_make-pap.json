You can add in a little butter for extra flavor. Replace the lid, and reduce the heat to low. You can use margarine as a substitute for butter. The goal is to have the ingredients mixed well, without being either too thick or too thin. Take some maize meal in a spoon and drop back into the pot.

Make sure to keep an eye on the pot so that your maize meal does not burn. If you feel as if the pot is getting too hot, you can slant the lid so that a small section allows hot air to go free. Let the lid stay slanted for a minute before you replace it. You can also add some more butter here if you feel as if the consistency is too thin."
