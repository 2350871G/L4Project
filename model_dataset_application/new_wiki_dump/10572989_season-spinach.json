Pulse the ingredients until they're combined and add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of poppy seeds. Pour the dressing over the spinach, along with bacon bits, sliced hard boiled eggs, red onion, mushrooms, and crumbled feta. Serve immediately. This recipe makes 4 servings.

This poppy seed dressing will last in the fridge for about 3 days."
