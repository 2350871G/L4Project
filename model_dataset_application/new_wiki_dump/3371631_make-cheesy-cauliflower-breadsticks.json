  "text":" Gather Ingredients Purchase one large head of cauliflower. One head will yield at least 20 sticks depending upon how they are cut. Make sure the cauliflower is cleaned and washed before using. Pick up fresh garlic, eggs, low fat mozzarella cheese, onion powder, salt and pepper. You will also need non-stick cooking spray too. Locate your food processor. This handy tool is what will transform the chunky cauliflower to a mealy substance that will make the bread sticks more like bread and less like cauliflower. Find a cheese grater or sharp knife. You will need to grate or chop the cheese to top the breadsticks. Find a large mixing bowl (or electric mixer) and a baking pan that will be used to bake these delightful treats. Make sure the baking pan has sides and isn\u2019t completely flat. The cauliflower mixer will essentially be poured into the pan so it will need sides to hold it in place. Create Cauliflower Breadsticks Prepare cooking area. Preheat oven to 450 and locate your food processor, bowl and cheese grater. Spray the baking pan with non-stick cooking spray. Chop cleaned cauliflower into chunks and soften in microwave or on the stove. You will need to steam the cauliflower so either boil chunks in water on the stove or place in a small amount of water in a microwave safe bowl and cook for up to 5 minutes. Strain water and place cauliflower into the food processor. Blend on high until cauliflower forms a mashed potato type consistency. Combine 2 cloves of garlic (minced or chopped) with 2 large beaten eggs, 4 oz. low fat  mozzarella cheese (grated or chopped), \u00bd tsp. onion powder, pinch of salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Add cauliflower and mix well. Pour mixture into the pre-coated baking pan. Cover well until the entire pan is filled with the cauliflower mixture.
