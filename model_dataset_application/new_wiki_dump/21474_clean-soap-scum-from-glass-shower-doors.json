You can buy commercial glass cleaners like Windex or Glance at any grocery store that sells cleaning supplies.

This is the best option to take if there\u2019s only a little bit of soap scum you have to clean. You can buy Magic Erasers and dryer sheets at any grocery store. Using a magic cleaning eraser is also the best method to use if you don\u2019t want to put any chemicals or scented products on your shower door."

          "description":"Bring a small pot of vinegar to a boil. Then, using a measuring cup, add equal parts of hot vinegar and dish soap to a spray bottle and mix the ingredients together. Spray this mixture onto the soap scum and let it sit for at least 30 minutes. Finally, rinse the mixture off of the door while scrubbing it with a microfiber cloth. Be very careful when working with hot vinegar, as it will burn you if you get it on your skin. For best results, leave the mixture on your shower door overnight before rinsing it off. If there\u2019s any scum that doesn\u2019t come off when you scrub it with the microfiber cloth, switch to a stiff-bristled brush and scrub a bit more forcefully."

Use a spoon to stir these ingredients into a paste. Dip a clean sponge into the paste and wipe it on your shower door. Let it sit for 15 minutes, then rinse the paste off the door while scrubbing it with a microfiber cloth. The paste that forms in the bucket should be about the consistency of pancake batter. You may need to add a bit more baking soda or a bit more vinegar to the mix in order to get it to this consistency. This is the best method to use if there are also hard water stains on your shower door that you want to get rid of."

Soak a sponge in hot water, then apply a small amount of toilet bowl cleaner to the sponge. Wipe the shower door with the sponge to clean off the soap scum, then rinse off the residue once you\u2019re done. Be sure to keep your bathroom well ventilated when using toilet bowl cleaner.

Mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of lemon juice with 2 tablespoons (34 grams) of salt to form a cleaning paste. Use an old toothbrush to scrub this mixture into the door frame and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Finally, rinse it off with warm water. Make sure you apply this paste to the corners of your shower door\u2019s frame, as this is where rust and soap scum are likely to build up and harder to clean otherwise."

Squeegees tend to be pretty cost-effective and you can usually buy them in the cleaning section of most grocery stores and mass retailers. This may seem like a chore to do in the short term, but it\u2019s much easier to squeegee your shower door after you shower than it is to clean off soap scum that\u2019s been building up for a long time. You should also open your bathroom windows or leave the fan running for at least 30 minutes after every shower. This will help dry out the bathroom and prevent the growth of mold and mildew."

The chemical compositions of baby oil and white vinegar both work to repel soap scum, making it much less likely to accumulate on your shower door. Be sure to rinse the door really well if you use baby oil, since it may cling a bit to the door. You can also use commercial glass-cleaning products, such as Rain-X, to prevent buildup."
