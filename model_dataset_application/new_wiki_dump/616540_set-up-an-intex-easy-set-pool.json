The first number in these dimensions refers to the diameter of the pool, and the second refers to the height of the pool (and depth of the water).

It can also have dangerous effects on the structural integrity of your pool over time. Look for a circular space that\u2019s at least as wide as the pool\u2019s diameter, plus two feet. While trees may seem appealing for the shade they\u2019d provide for pool goers, don\u2019t put your pool under them unless you want to be cleaning a lot of debris out of the water. Minor landscaping may be necessary to level out your ground, using a shovel or a sod scraper. You should always bring higher areas down to match lower areas, rather than filling in the lower areas. Filled-in and and dirt will compact under the weight of the pool over time and cause those areas to be uneven. Concrete is also acceptable to place your pool on, and may even be preferable. Ensure there are no cracks or sharp edges in the areas, however, as these can tear the pool\u2019s liner, and never drag your pool along concrete."
