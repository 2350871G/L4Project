Just make three or four wire loops, and bunch them together at the top by wrapping the ends of a piece of wire tightly around them. Push the marble into the center of the cage, then use pliers and wire cutters to make adjustments and loop the wire around jump rings or other jewelry components. If you enjoy this look, there are all kinds of techniques you can learn. Try this classy wrapping pattern. Aluminum wire is easy to manipulate and doesn't tarnish. 20- or 22-gauge wire works well for more jewelry projects."
