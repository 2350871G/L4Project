          "description":"Typically, the best time to do this is at the end of summer or in early autumn, based on when your plant stops flowering. Use pruning shears or loppers to remove about one third of your plant's total mass. This encourages the plant to grow new buds, so it can bloom beautifully the following season. Make your cuts at a 45-degree angle to minimally damage the plant. If your plant is very small or does not grow quickly, it only requires a light pruning. You can snip around one fourth of the plant off rather than one third."

          "description":"In addition to reducing the overall size of your plant, go around the plant and look for any browning areas or withered stems. Snip these stems off using your pruning shears, and make your cut at a 45-degree angle as close to the ground as you can. This way, your plant will grow fresh, healthy stems. If you leave unhealthy stems, they will drain your plant's nutrients. To keep your plant healthy, it is best to get rid of any unsightly stems. Avoid cutting green shoots. These are alive and can still grow healthy buds."

Use pruning shears or a hedge clipper to cut off the stems of the plant as close to the ground as you can. This sends the plant into dormancy through the colder season. As it starts to get warm, the plant grows new, healthy stems. This is a good idea if your kangaroo paw has overgrown your garden bed or if the plant looks withered and sickly. If your kangaroo paws are in a pot rather than your garden, it is healthier for the plant to leave a few healthy stems if you can. That way, it can grow back faster."
