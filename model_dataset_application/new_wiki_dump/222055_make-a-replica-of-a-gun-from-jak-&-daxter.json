  "text":" Getting the Design For this you will need some basic sketching ability and a complete Jak 3 game.  Access the Secrets menu and get into the Jak II and Jak 3 model viewers.  Choose your gun. The only characters carrying their guns in the viewer are Sig and Kleiber. The Krimzon Guards are carrying them too, but they are harder to make. Sketch your chosen gun. Try to get it accurate, especially the scale. The more accurate the better. Getting the Plans First of all, whip out a calculator. Measure your height and measure the length of the gun on your sketch. Sig's gun is somewhere around 1/2 in length. Divide your height by three and separate into two parts, one twice the length of the other. Draw a line on some paper. Divide the line up into two parts like above, and label the lengths. Using the sketch you made earlier, trace the detail on the gun to your plans. Making the Gun Take your length of pipe and cut the long 'barrel' length. At the same time cut the two other lengths of pipe, these will be the supports for the stock. Cut out a piece of wood roughly the same size as what was on your plan.  Using a 3 centimeter (1.2 in) drill bit, drill holes where the gun will fit into the small piece of wood you cut in the last step.  Attach to this a length of wood which you have shaped to feel comfortable in your hand to the bottom of this piece of wood. You can pin it with dowel and glue; this is a lot cleaner than trying to nail it into place. Take your lengths of pipe and fit them into the holes you drilled. Secure them by hammering nails through them onto the other side of the drill-hole. Create the stock. This can be done by carving if you are skilled enough, but you can always saw the rough shape and sand it back. Mark on it where you plan to put the pipes to secure it to the rest of the gun, and drill in there. Attach it in the same way you attached the pipes to the central piece. Creating the Metal-Head Barrel Tip This is the hard bit. Shape it in the same way you did with the stock. You'll have to carve out the eyes. Attach teeth made out of a cut up Ice-cream container.  Carve a groove, that fits the pipe in the bottom. Using this to secure the position, glue it on. If you'd like, you can find a way to secure it with nails. Cut out two roughly square pieces of wood and stick them to the sides of head you've carved. Once again, nail them if you aren't sure they'll stay on. Create a horn out of something, I used rolled up card-board, and attach this to the fore-head.  Make the spike under the barrel out of thick cardboard, or, if you're more adventurous, you can attempt to make one out of wood. Attach it to the barrel where the plans show. Painting and Detailing the Gun If you're not particularly artistic just covering it with light gun-metal grey will do the trick, making sure you paint the eye-grooves yellow.  If you are a bit more artistic, dry brush very lightly with beige.  To make it more comfortable to hold, you can rap the handle with cloth and secure it with super glue or tacks.  If you can be bothered, and you know how to, you can wire it with lights. Find a yellow light which will fit comfortably into your 3 centimeter (1.2 in) piping. Position this in the barrel of the pipe and wire it so that the switch is somewhere near the handle for easy access. That way, while your child is at school, he can run around looking just like Sig.",
