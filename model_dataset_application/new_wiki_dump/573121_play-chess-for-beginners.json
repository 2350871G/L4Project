          "description":"Every type of piece moves differently. Here are the names of every piece and how they move (with one or two exceptions, that we'll cover in a bit):\n\nThe pawn: The most basic piece in the game (you have 8 of them). On its initial move, it can move forward one or two vacant spaces, but it is only allowed to move forward by one vacant space afterwards. Pawns cannot move forward if they are blocked by an enemy piece but can capture those that are situated one space diagonally in front. The pawn is the only piece that cannot move backwards and is also the only piece that captures in a way that is different from how it normally moves. The rook: It looks like a castle tower. It can move horizontally or vertically as many spaces as are available. It can capture enemy pieces in its path. The knight: It's represented by a horse and is the most complicated unit. It moves in an 'L' shapes that consist of two spaces horizontally then one space vertically, or one space horizontally then two spaces vertically. The knight is the only piece that can jump other pieces (both friend and enemy). However, he only captures an enemy piece if it is in the space where he settles. The bishop:  It can only move diagonally, but it can move an unlimited amount of spaces in that direction. It can capture enemy pieces in its path. The queen: She is the most powerful piece (usually has a more feminine crown). She can move either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally by any number of spaces and capture from any of those directions. The king: He can only move one space each turn in any direction and captures in the same manner. He is the unit you do not want to lose at all cost but is never actually captured. It is an illegal move for a player to move his own king into check. A check that occurs as a result of an opponent's move must be resolved immediately, and checkmate loses the game. Remember the strong points of the pieces. The king is valuable and must be protected. The queen is the most versatile piece and is the most useful for supporting pieces, and often used for forking. The queen combines the power of a bishop and a rook in one piece. She is considered to be the most valuable, next to the King. Knights are excellent for surprise attacks and forks. Their pattern of movement is often missed and confusing to novice players. Bishops tend to be an excellent in an open position. However many novice players often underestimate bishops and do not make full use of them. Rooks are strong and have a long range of movement. They work best on open files. Pawns may seem insignificant, but they can be great for trapping an opponent when sacrificed to capture a more valuable piece. If played right, a pawn can even checkmate the King!

But there are a few things to keep in mind:\nDo not go about about attacking for now. In your opening, you're just getting your pieces to their most useful posts. You want them to be on good and safe squares. Generally, make only 1 or 2 moves with your pawns. Then start concentrating on your more powerful pieces -- bishops, knights, queen, and rooks. \"Development\" (getting your pieces to active squares, such as the center) isn't complete until all of these pieces have moved.

Let's say you do just that, landing next to your opponent's pawn, on the same row. On the next move -- and only the next move -- your opponent can capture your pawn en passant (which literally translates to: in passing). Normally, pieces can only capture by moving into the square that had been occupied by that enemy piece -- but this is an exceptional case where the enemy pawn moves into the square that the pawn has passed over and still captures that pawn. Again, this can only happen right after a pawn has made its initial 2-space move. If a turn goes by, the opportunity is lost. This move is unique only to the pawns and no other piece.

Pawns may seem like they're just in the way, but don't be tempted to sacrifice them just yet. If you get a pawn to the other side of the board, it immediately gets promoted into another piece (just not the king)! Naturally one would choose a queen, but in rare cases, one may choose a knight or a rook or even a bishop.

This isn't a game where you can mindlessly move pieces around -- they all affect each other in one way or another. You'll have a pawn in the way of your bishop's attack, you'll have your knight defending your king, and your opponent's rook is about to jump on your queen if you don't do something about it. So plan your next move and the one after that -- and your opponent's moves if you can, too. To win, you must be tactful and strategic! Always have a comeback move, if possible.

Apart from the pawn's en passant move, one other special move is castling. That's when your rook and your king exchange places -- it shelters the king and gets your rook developed and ready to join the action. It is generally useful to have your king castled. You can use your castle only if :\nNeither the King nor the Rook to be castled have moved. The King is not in check. There are no pieces between the King and the rook. The king does not pass over or end up on a square that is in the control of an enemy piece. In one turn, you move both your king and your rook. First move the king, two squares toward the rook, and then place the rook in the square adjacent to the king on the other side. If you castle on the Kingside, the rook moves a total of two squares. If you castle on the Queenside, the rook moves a total of three squares."

At this point your opponent taps over his king so that it falls and signals defeat. Stalemates do happen -- when the ends in a draw. This is when the player whose turn it is to move is not in check but has no legal moves with the king or any other piece. There are a few other ways by which a game can end in a draw. By agreement. If both players agree that they can no longer win or see a method to win, they can agree to draw. By repetition. If the same exact position of the chess board, occurs at three different points in a game, the game is declared a draw. For example, if both players just keep moving their Knights back and forth to the same squares, the game will be declared a draw. By the 50 move rule. If neither player makes a pawn move or captures a piece for 50 consecutive moves, the game will be declared as a draw. This prevents player from playing endlessly, or to tire the other player out. By insufficient material. If neither player has sufficient material to checkmate the king, the game is considered a draw. For example, a Knight and a King alone cannot checkmate the lone enemy King. If all other pieces except the kings are captured and are off the board. This is an example of insufficient material and a King cannot checkmate or check the other king all by himself.

You want to get your opponent fleeing rather than attacking as soon as possible. He can do very little on his own, yet he can hold his own. In the starting and the middle phases of the game, he almost always needs at least one or two pieces to watch out for any checks.
