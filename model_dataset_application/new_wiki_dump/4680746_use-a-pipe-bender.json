Insert the die into the die slot and insert the pin into the die to secure it. Install the follower block: The size of the follower block has to correspond with the die. Place the block near the die with sufficient space for the tube. Then take the follower block pin and insert it into the main bender arm and the follower block. Prepare the pipe: Take a pipe with a size corresponding to that of the die and the follower block. Using a pen or marker, make a random mark at the point where you want to start the bend. Insert the pipe: The follower block is kept loose so as to adjust the height when inserting the tube. Hold the pipe in between the follower block and the die. Vertically align the block to the pipe, and then insert the pipe into the machine. The die will rotate outwards as you insert the pipe. Once the pipe is in place, rotate the die back into the correct position. Install the U-strap: The U-strap holds the pipe in place with the lug.
