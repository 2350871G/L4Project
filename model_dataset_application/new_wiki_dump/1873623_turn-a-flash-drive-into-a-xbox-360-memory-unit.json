Selecting \"Customize\" will allow you to choose how big you want the Xbox 360 partition to be, which will allow you to use the drive for other things. When you select \"Customize,\" use the slider to set how much space you want to dedicate to Xbox 360 storage. If you don't see these options, your USB drive either does not have at least 1 GB of storage available, or is not formatted with the FAT32 file system. Make sure that your USB drive has enough storage to work with the Xbox 360. Your Xbox 360 will reserve 512 MB of space on your drive for system files, so the size will appear slightly smaller."
