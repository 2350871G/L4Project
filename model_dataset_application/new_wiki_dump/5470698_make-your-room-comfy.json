          "description":"A padded headboard is great to lean up against while hanging out with friends, reading a book, or watching TV. While there are lots of different headboard styles, like wood and wire, get a plushy and upholstered one for maximum comfort. You can buy one or make your own DIY headboard for a fun and cost-friendly option. Make sure that your headboard fits your bed frame and mattress size."

          "headline":"Pad your mattress with a plush mattress pad or topper.",
          "description":"This'll add extra bounce and warmth to your bed. It's also an easy way to increase the quality of your mattress without buying an entirely new one. Just make sure the padding you choose is the right size and fit for your bed. While padding your mattress helps, it won't fix an old saggy one. Keep in mind that they wear out after 10 years, so consider getting a new one if you need it."

          "headline":"Line your bed with soft sheets.",
          "description":"Rough sheets can make sleeping and hanging out in your bed uncomfortable, scratchy, and itchy. Instead, wrap yourself in sheets that are soft to the touch for a comfortable sleep experience. If you can, opt for cotton sheets. Cotton is naturally soft and wicks away moisture. This'll help you keep cool, yet insulated while you sleep. Typically, the higher the thread count, the softer the sheets will be."

          "headline":"Layer your bed with different kinds of bedding to make it feel like a cloud.",
          "description":"The more layers you add, the fluffier and comfier your bed will be. Use either a duvet and duvet cover or comforter as the foundation of your bedding. If you like to sleep with weight on you, pick a thick and heavy duvet or comforter to keep you warm at night. You can also cover your bed in throw blankets for even more fluff and warmth. Choose soft, fuzzy, or furry blankets. Depending on what you like, you can throw them messily on your bed, lay them neatly on top of your comforter as an extra bedding layer, or fold them at the end of your bed. For extra comfort, add quilts to your bed. You can layer these on top of your duvet, or fold it horizontally and place it at the end of the bed."

          "headline":"Put a variety of comfy pillows on your bed for sleeping and relaxing.",
          "description":"Use different pillow styles to make your bed look inviting, but not too overwhelming to make it hard for you to sit on your bed and lie back. While your sleeping pillow will be most important, consider getting Euro and standard sized pillows for extra comfort and style. Depending on your sleep preferences, get a foam or feather sleeping pillow. Soft pillows are great for people who sleep on their stomach, while firm pillows are good for people who sleep on their side and medium-firm pillows are perfect for people that sleep on their back. Euro pillows are large, square, and firm. They're great to prop up and lean against. On the other hand, standard pillows are smaller, rectangular, and plushier. Add a long body pillow for extra comfort."

Instead of choosing bright and loud colors for your room, like red, opt for warmer and more muted colors. Some colors to keep in mind are pale yellow, light pink, muted green, and soft blue. Don't be afraid to mix and match colors! Consider painting your walls, using wallpaper, adding wall art, or other decorations in the colors of your choice. Add a variety of color tones, use contrasting colors like yellow and blue, or add a color accent by picking a splash of color.

For an easy DIY, use small nails to secure pieces of twine, string, or yarn to your bedroom wall. Then, use clothespins to hang your pictures to the lines.

Use overhead lights, a dimmer, and lamps around your room to illuminate your room. Position your lamps on your bedside table to make your bed more comfortable. You can also put them on your dresser, desk, vanity, etc. Put standing lamps next to your comfy seating if you have any. This'll make your reading nook extra cozy and warm.
