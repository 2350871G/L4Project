If funds are missing from your account but you have had possession of your card and/or you did not give your PIN to anyone, you may be a victim of electronic theft. If you are able to access a list of your transactions online, examine them to see if there are any PIN-less purchases. If you are unable to see your transactions online, ask your case worker for a statement listing the transactions on your EBT account."
