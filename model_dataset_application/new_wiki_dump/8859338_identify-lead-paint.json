If your home is old and you know it was built in the early or mid 1900s, it may have lead-based paint. Often, historic buildings or homes that are old and have not been renovated contain lead-based paint."

Lead-based paint that is deteriorating can pose a health hazard, as it will release lead dust as it breaks down. Pay extra attention to paint that is on doorways or stairwells. These areas usually get more wear and tear, causing the paint to crack, flake, and peel. If you notice the paint is deteriorating and suspect it may be lead-based, test the paint so you can address the issue immediately."
