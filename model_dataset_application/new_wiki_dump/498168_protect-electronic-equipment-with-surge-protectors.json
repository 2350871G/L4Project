They usually have several outlets and a power switch built in. Surge suppressors use a combination of components (gas tubes, avalanche diodes and metal oxide varistors or MOV's) to protect equipment in an over voltage condition, and \"clamp\" it to safety ground. Some devices may provide for very short duration under voltage protection as well."
