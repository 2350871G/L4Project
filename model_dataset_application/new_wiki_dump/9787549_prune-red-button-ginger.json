In particular, look for brown spots on the plant\u2019s leaves, withered areas along the edges of the leaves, and discolored areas in the plant\u2019s spiral flower. Prune your ginger as soon as it shows signs of damage to prevent plant-wide infections. Red button ginger plants often get damaged during frosts and droughts."

Since the areas you pruned were damaged, place them in a trash can or similar receptacle where they won\u2019t have access to other plants. If you leave the trimmings on the ground, they can develop diseases like botrytis that, over time, will spread to your other plants and the surrounding soil."

If you\u2019re pruning your plant right before winter, cut the stem off near the ground so it has a better chance of surviving the cold and reflowering in the spring.

If you live in a USDA hardiness zone 9-11, you can move your plant outside once it establishes roots. This normally occurs after 2 to 3 weeks.
