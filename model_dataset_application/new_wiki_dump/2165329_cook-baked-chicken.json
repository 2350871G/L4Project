You will also need salt and pepper and some good quality olive oil."

Coat the bottom of your roasting pan in olive oil, then add the chicken and toss to coat. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken pieces with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Arrange the chicken pieces skin side up, with the larger sections (the breasts and thighs) towards the center of the roasting pan. Make sure the chicken pieces aren't crowded together."

          "description":"Place the roasting pan in an oven preheated to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) and cook for 30 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350 and cook for an additional 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the quantity of chicken. In general, you need to assign 14 to 15 minutes of cooking time for every pound of chicken. For example, cooking a 4 lbs chicken takes approximately an hour. It's very important that the chicken is thoroughly cooked, so don't rely on cooking time alone. Check the juices by poking the chicken breast with a sharp knife -- they should run clear once the chicken is fully cooked. If they are pink, the chicken is not cooked yet. If you have an instant-read thermometer, use it to check the temperature of the thickest part of the chicken. The breasts should register an internal temperature of 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C), while the thighs should register at 170 degrees, when fully cooked."

Once browned, remove the chicken from the roasting pan, place it on a serving dish and cover with aluminum foil. Allow the chicken to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. During this time you can make the gravy (described below), if desired."
