Teens have a couple of milestone celebrations like sweet sixteen or eighteen. For anyone over 22 or 25, birthdays indicate you're just getting older. For people who are in their twenties or older, you can be funny by acknowledging their age. For example, for somebody's 45th birthday, you could say, \u201cOnly ten more years until you can start using senior discounts.\u201d\nWhen writing cards for younger kids, it doesn't matter as much what you tell them. Try saying something funny in kid humor, like \u201crock your tail off, Cody!\u201d\nAnother approach is to recall a moment you've had with this person. Say you met after you dropped your lunch tray and she helped you pick it up: \u201cI can always count on you to help me pick up food.\""

          "description":"Holidays like Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, or Christmas usually warrant a more heartfelt message. For these types of cards you can write about what the holiday means to you. For example: \u201cThanksgiving is centered around turkey and gravy, but I'm just thankful to spend it with you.\u201d\nYou can also take the slapstick approach to a holiday card: \u201cWhen grandma starts drinking eggnog, it's family time,\u201d or \u201cAll I want for Christmas is New Year's Eve. I'll settle with an afternoon with you.\u201d\nYou might find it difficult to be unique for a holiday occasion, but if you add some of your personality, it will be distinctive enough for a greeting card."

Whether it's a card to celebrate a Baptism, Yom Kippur, Eid, or Confirmation, you can make your message unique by writing from your heart. Describe your relationship to the celebrant in a sentence or two, and finish by noting how happy you are for the person on their special day. These types cards rarely involve humor, but if you think of a joke, try it out. The key to adding humor to a religious celebration is being tasteful. Never shame or belittle anyone in this type of card."

Learn about the recipient's condition briefly before writing the card. Focus on making this person smile. A good way to write a unique message is by explaining a trait of this person that makes you happy. Try something like this:\n\u201dJohn, lunch is my favorite part of Tuesdays, thanks to you!\u201d\n\"Steph, remember when you made me laugh so hard I almost peed?\u201d\n\"LaTisha, you are one of the most caring people in the office.

Make your family member feel extra special by adding unique qualities to the card. One way to add a specialized message is to talk about the person. Describe their character in a positive way. Incorporate yourself and the recipient into a short story you cherish. Try to keep the story short. Another way you can add something unique is by incorporating an inside joke you share. If you don't have an inside joke, you could add another form of humor. Express your love for them. Many greeting cards to family members already do this, but it's important to show them love. They will appreciate it."

Reflect on your relationship with your co worker and think back if there was a special moment you shared. Make your greeting brief, but try to include something you shared together.
