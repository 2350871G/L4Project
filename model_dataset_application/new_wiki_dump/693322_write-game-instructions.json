          "description":"Whether you\u2019re writing your game rules on a notepad, whiteboard, or printing in a pamphlet, take a look at how your favorite games format the instructions for inspiration and examples. Take notes of how other instructions are formatted. Notice the hierarchy of the information explained. How the structure allows you to see the big picture. When writing your own rules try to follow a similar format. Make a checklist of sections to include that you see in other instruction books. You can even emulate the style if you want."

          "description":"When you write the instructions and information of your game, assume that people will be reading aloud. One person usually reads the instructions to the group. Have the tense reflect someone reading out loud during the play of the game. This means that your tense and tone should default to present tense, active voice, and be pithy, or quick. Whether you\u2019re explaining the game that you created for the first time, or someone else is explaining it with your rulebook, you want to make the text quick and easy to understand. For example, if you have a board game about two countries at war, you might explain the objective like: \u201cYou are a member of one of the two countries at war. You are assigned a role to aid your country. The goal of the game is to work together to defeat the enemy country in one of three ways: You can win by destroying the country through war, assassinating the country\u2019s leader, or being the first country to go into space.\u201d\nWith simple descriptions and an active voice you can easily get a good amount of information out. Players now know the objective and winning methods of the game."

This will help you to convey the rules of your game. The second person helps you when reading, as well as other players learning the game in the future. There are times when you don\u2019t have to use the second person. When describing what certain objects or tokens may do for a player, you can use \u201cThe player\u2026\u201d if it makes more sense. To avoid situations where using the second person sounds awkward, remember to try and use active voice. Instead of \u201cThe cards are shuffled.\u201d Say \u201cYou shuffle the cards.\u201d This active voice also gives the players strong direction of what to do."

If the explanation needs more depth, add a notation, then include a separate section explaining it further. For example, if you mention that one way to win is to kill the enemy\u2019s leader, state where you can find the instructions on how to do this. Add separate section that explains this in more detail. If you have room, you can briefly explain the term before continuing on. Never include a term that new players won\u2019t understand without explaining it. Always show players where to find more information on the term."

Then include up at the top which pieces are included. Then move on to the objective, the setup, how the play operates, and what each piece or character does. After explaining how you win, you may include more sections that deeper explains objects, moves, or player types you touched on earlier. Your instructions should work like a book or story. You start with a table of contents. After that you may have a preface or forward, something that outlines your game. This can be your objective. When explaining the rules and different parts of the game\u2019s flow, do it in the order that it will happen. It should follow a beginning, middle, and end. You'll also want to include a brief section early on that details how many players can play, and the age range. Explain the setup before you explain the start of play so that players can set up the board. When the players finish reading about the setup, the next section should explain how to start playing. Following, you will have a style of play. For example, if you have a turned based game, next explain how the turns work.

If you are explaining how a turn works and then need to explain that at the end of every turn a player draws one type of card, that's\u2019 ok.
