          "description":"Press the towel over the wet memory foam and hold until the towel is saturated. Repeat the process until there isn't any more liquid to be soaked up. A bath towel is best for high absorbency, but you can also use paper towels. If the spill can stain, make sure to use a towel that you don't mind getting stained and dirty. Never twist or fold memory foam to wring out liquid--this can damage the foam's structure. Always press gently to soak up any liquid instead."

Follow the instructions that come with your cleaner and soak up any excess liquid when you're finished. Generally, you should pour some enzyme-based cleaner on the spill, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then blot up as much cleaner as possible. Although some suggest using hydrogen peroxide to break down bloodstains, this is inadvisable. Hydrogen peroxide will damage the memory foam's surface."

Do a touch test to determine if the foam is fully dried. Your mattress should also feel much lighter when it's dry. If it still feels heavy around the washed area, it probably still contains some trapped water."
