However, if you bottle your own honey or you bought it from a local farmer, it may be \u201craw\u201d or unfiltered. Put a 300 micron filter over the top of a glass jar, and pour your honey through it. The filter will catch pollen and other particles. Crystals often start forming around the particles in unfiltered honey, so you can slow down the crystallization process by filtering raw honey. You can buy a filter online, at a home supply store, or at a beekeeping supply store."

If you have a choice, try to buy honey made from acacia, cranberry, gallberry, grape, milkweed, sage, sunflower, or tupelo.

Buying small jars of honey may help you finish the honey before it crystallizes."
