Reducing the amount of liquid ingredients in the recipe by \u00bc usually provides the best results. If you\u2019re making a recipe with a liquid that\u2019s hard to reduce, you can increase the amount of flour than you use instead. For example, if you need to add whole eggs, increase the spelt flour by 10 to 15% instead of reducing the amount of the eggs."
