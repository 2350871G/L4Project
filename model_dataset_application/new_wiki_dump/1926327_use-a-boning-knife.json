  "text":" Removing Bones Place the meat in the center of your cutting board. Choose a board large enough to ensure that you'll have enough space to work. Place your non-dominant hand on an area of the meat away from the bone in order to stabilize the cut. Locate the bone in the cut of meat. The bone placement might be obvious in some cuts of meat, but you may need to use your knife to trim away some excess fat in order to find the bone. Make your first cut through the meat along the length of the bone. Use the tip of your boning knife to slice the meat in order to expose the bone from the surrounding meat. Curl the fingers of your non-cutting hand in order to protect them as you make your first cut. Saw the blade back and forth between the bone and the flesh of the meat. Use the tip of the blade to slide beneath the bone at a slight angle. Repeat this slice along the length of the bone until your blade has sufficiently exposed the bone from the cut of meat. Scrape the edges of the meat from the bone with the knife. Stabilize the bone with your non-cutting hand, and use your knife to make small, flicking motions in order to scrape the cut of meat away from the bone. Use a part of the blade closer to the handle of the knife for greater control for your scraping motions. Remove the bone from the meat. If there are any parts of the meat still attached to the bone, work the center of the blade in a sawing motion until you have freed the meat completely from the bone. Once your meat is fully removed from the bone, use your knife to remove any stray pieces of bone or cartilage that are attached to the cut of meat. Removing Skin from Meat Place the cut of meat in the center of a cutting board with the skin on top. The skin will have a silvery tone, and appear slightly grainy compared to the meat. Stabilize the meat on the cutting board with your non-dominant hand, and position the blade of your knife pointing down towards the skin at the top of the cut. If the skin appears shiny, it is likely covered with a layer of fat, which you can pull away with your fingers before removing the skin. Make a small incision where the skin meets the meat. Use the tip of your blade to slice the spot right where the grainy silver skin makes contact with the flesh of the meat. Your initial slit should be no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. Hold the separated skin with the fingers of your non-dominant hand. Once you\u2019ve made this first incision, you should be able to separate a small amount of skin from the meat with your fingers. Continue to slice between the skin and the meat. Make several more short, small cuts along the length of the cut, and continue pulling the skin upwards with your non-dominant hand. The excess skin should look like a thin, 1-2 inch (2-5 cm) wide ribbon that you are slowly pulling away from the cut of meat. Angle your blade upwards, and make several long, slow cuts. Once you have removed between 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) of skin from the meat, begin to make longer cuts along the length of the cut. Continue to gather the silver skin with your non-dominant hand as the blade detaches it from the meat. Remove pieces of skin once they are separated from the meat. Discard ribbons of skin once your blade has successfully sliced from front to back on the piece of meat. Once you remove a piece of skin, a section of clean meat should be exposed. Repeat until your entire cut of meat is free of skin. Removing Skin from Fish Filet Lay the fish skin-side down on the cutting board. The filet should be horizontal on the board, with the tail of the fish closest to your body. If your filet doesn't have a tail, the thinner side of the filet should be closest to your body. Make a small, 1-2 inch (2-5 cm) incision at the base of the tail. Use the tip of your knife to slice directly into the fish meat where the filet meets the tail. This cut should be parallel to the skin, and should not cut through the skin. Use your non-dominant hand to lift the filet away from the tail. Slice the blade of the knife along the length of the skin. After you\u2019ve made your first incision, slide your knife between the filet and the skin while pulling the skin taut in the opposite direction with your non-dominant hand. Use the flexibility of the blade to trace along the entire length of the fish. Check to make sure you're cutting close to the skin. Once you've sliced through the first third of the filet, put down the knife, and use your hands to pull the filet away from the skin in order to make sure your knife is running close enough to the skin. If you notice a substantial amount of filet meat still attached to the skin, adjust the path of your knife to cut closer to the skin. Remove the skin from the filet. Once you\u2019ve traced the length of the skin with the blade of your knife, the skin should be removed from the filet. Selecting a Boning Knife Look for a knife with a flexible blade. A boning knife with a flexible blade will grant you greater control and versatility when removing bones and skin - not just from cuts of meat, but from fish and poultry as well. Alternatively, if you plan to use your boning knife exclusively for thicker cuts of meat (chucks, flanks, etc. ), you should opt for a stiffer blade specifically for carving denser meats. Choose a curved blade between 5-6.5 inches (13-16.5 cm) long. Most boning knives on the market will feather blades within this range. A shorter, curved blade affords greater control and precision for removing bones from meat and fish. Opt for a stainless steel blade. Stainless steel is extremely durable, and will remain sharp after many uses. While there are several different varieties of stainless steel blades - including high carbon blades, which are lightweight, and cold steel, which tend to be more durable - any kind of stainless steel blade will suffice for a decent boning knife.",
