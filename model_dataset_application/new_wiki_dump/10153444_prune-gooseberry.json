Regular pruning shears are sufficient for most gooseberry pruning, but you may need a pair of loppers for old wood and larger, mature branches. Pruning Branches That May Damage the Plant Get rid of branches low to the ground. Low branches will grow into the mulch, where they may become entangled in weeds or leave fruit to rot. Low branches may also pick up splash from the soil when it rains, which can lead to fungal diseases. Remove suckers. These are the upright shoots which grow out of the soil near the main stem. Suckers are best removed by pulling in summer, when they\u2019re soft, but if you miss any you can cut them to the ground during winter pruning. Prune out crossing branches. Branches that rub together may lead to cankers and diseases, and lower branches will be deprived of sufficient sunlight.

Diseases such as coral spot, which can be identified by coral-pink pustules on weak branches, must be nipped in the bud, as it were. Remove diseased or damaged branches at the point where they meet their parent branch. Diseased wood is marked by broken bark and rough, raised areas. Sterilize your pruning shears if you have been cutting diseased wood to avoid infecting other plants. Dead wood is brittle and has no buds. Damaged branches are missing bark where they have rubbed other branches. Pruning to Improve Gooseberry Productivity Prune out any branches that are more than 3 years old. The best fruit comes from branches that are 2 and 3 years old, and therefore older branches should be cut to renew the plant. Older branches are thicker, darker in color, and may have slightly peeling bark. Gooseberry is typically grown as a \u201cstool,\u201d a bunch of stems arising from the ground, with old shoots regularly cut to the base.
