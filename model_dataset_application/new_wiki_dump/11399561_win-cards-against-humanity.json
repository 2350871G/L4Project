The Card Czar changes every round, so knowing the Card Czar\u2019s personality is essential to scoring every turn. For example, \u201cMagnets\u201d isn\u2019t particularly funny on its own, but if the black card is \u201cWhat never fails to liven up the party?\u201d everyone else is going to expect some crazy, over-the-top answer. You can steal rounds by playing an unexpected card this way. Another example might be using the card \u201cMen\u201d for the black card \u201cMTV\u2019s new reality show features eight celebrities living with ________,\u201d which has some humorous undertones but is a clever way of using a boring white card."

          "description":"A common way to get a good laugh out of the Card Czar is to create racy images in their mind. As you\u2019re looking through your cards, find a way to create some risqu\u00e9 images with your white cards. This is often a popular way to try and make the Card Czar laugh, so it may not work out on every round if your opponents have better cards. Sometimes, simply being random is a good way to score depending on the Card Czar.For example, answering \u201cWhat is Batman\u2019s guilty pleasure?\u201d with \u201cChunks of dead hitchhiker\u201d is disgusting, but it is highly likely to get a laugh at the table. For cards that are designed to draw sexual answers, like \u201cWhy am I sticky?\u201d sometimes it\u2019s better to just be random. Go against the grain and play \u201cCourt-ordered rehab,\u201d or \u201cClassist undertones,\u201d to create bizarre connections."

          "description":"To optimize your odds of winning the game, it may help to hold your best white card until an outrageous black card comes along. With hilarious black cards, everyone else at the table will play their best card, but they\u2019ve likely played most of their strong cards over the course of the past couple of rounds. Holding your best option as long as you can means that you\u2019ll have the best card at the table when everyone else has already played their stronger cards. A good way to tell if a black card is going to draw the best white cards out of everyone\u2019s hand is if everyone laughs when the black card is flipped over. Killer white cards tend to be funny on their own because they conjure specific ideas and images. Examples include \u201cA windmill full of corpses,\u201d \u201cWomen in yogurt commercials,\u201d and \u201cThe Tempur-Pedic Swedish Sleep System.\u201d"

All answers are not created equal, and if a card just doesn\u2019t seem very funny, you\u2019re never going to win with it. If a card has been in your hand for the entire game, it may also be a sign that it simply isn\u2019t a winner.Tip: The over-the-top gross cards might seem like they\u2019re great, but unless you\u2019re playing with a younger group, they probably won\u2019t do very well. Examples include \u201cBoobs,\u201d \u201cFlying sex snakes,\u201d and \u201cThe Blood of Christ.\u201d\nThe \u201cdad joke\u201d cards tend to not be very popular unless you\u2019re playing with an older crowd. Cards like \u201cBarack Obama,\u201d \u201cConsultants,\u201d and \u201cGrowing a pair\u201d tend to draw an eye roll from most players."

The Card Czar may even simply be ashamed to admit that they think it\u2019s funny. Sometimes this will be unavoidable though. There\u2019s no funny way to use the card that reads \u201cAuschwitz,\u201d for example, without being  offensive.There are usually better ways to use offensive answers anyway, since they can be used to create certain unexpected answers. For example, \u201cThe Holy Bible\u201d is a great answer for \u201cComing to Broadway this season, ________: The Musical.\u201d"

These cards often get used in obvious ways, so play them on apolitical or unassuming black cards to get an unexpected laugh. If0 the answer fits too perfectly, it usually doesn\u2019t win, and these celebrity cards fit too cleanly into a lot of obvious prompts.For example, \u201cBarack Obama\u201d is an obvious answer for \u201cWhat\u2019s George W. Bush thinking about right now?\u201d and isn\u2019t likely to win the round. It\u2019s a clever and random answer for something like \u201cWhat helps Obama unwind?\u201d though. There are lots of expansion packs for Cards Against Humanity, and some of them reference obscure musicians or politicians. If you don\u2019t know the celebrity on your card, treat it like the worst card in your hand and burn it when you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll win a round."

If the reserved player that hates sex jokes is judging, stay away from the risqu\u00e9 answers. Customizing your responses based on the judge is a good way to consistently score.Tip: Most players play the card that they personally find funny. Being able to tune out your own sense of humor and consider the Czar\u2019s personality is a good way to score points. Be sensitive to serious events in the Card Czar\u2019s personal history. For example, if their father died of cancer, playing an answer like \u201cTerminally ill\u201d or \u201cYour dad\u201d isn\u2019t going to go over well."
