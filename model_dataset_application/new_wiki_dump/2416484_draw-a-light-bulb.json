Draw a line that is relatively straight, but halfway up it bends to the outside. Draw two of these bending in different directions."

When colouring in the edge of the bight bulb, press a bit harder so it is a little darker while the very inside of the light bulb should be very lightly coloured. The silver/blue colour is for the bottom part of the light bulb. Don't colour it in too dark so that you can't see the curved lines you drew in step 5."
