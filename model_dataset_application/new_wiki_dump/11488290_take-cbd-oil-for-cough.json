          "description":"A tincture is the fastest way to get relief, so it might be your best bet if you\u2019re hoping to stop a cough. To use a tincture, measure out 1-2 drops using the eyedropper that came with your product. Squeeze the drops under your tongue and hold them there for 30 seconds before swallowing. You\u2019ll likely feel the effects of the CBD in 15-30 minutes if it works for you. Some tinctures are sold in a spray bottle. If yours is a spray, apply 1 spritz to the inside of each cheek. Tinctures come in different flavors, so choose 1 you like.Variation: You can mix a tincture into your favorite beverage if you prefer. For instance, you might put 1-2 drops of tincture in a warm mug of tea with honey to help soothe your cough."

          "description":"Capsules are easy to take and ensure you get a consistent dose each time. Plus, they won't cause further irritation to your throat and airways. Purchase capsules from a drugstore, dispensary, or online. Then, take them as directed on the label. If they work for you, capsules typically take 30-90 minutes to become effective."

          "headline":"Experiment with CBD edibles to see if they work for you.",
          "description":"Although CBD edibles are convenient and fun, they typically provide inconsistent results and take 2-4 hours to work. If you want to try edibles, look for candies and snacks that contain CBD at your grocery store, drug store, dispensary, or online. Then, consume 1 serving as directed on the label. If the first edible you try doesn\u2019t work for you, try a different brand to see if you get different results. Everyone is different, so you\u2019ll need to find the products that work best for you.Tip: Since sucking on a hard candy or lozenge helps a dry cough and sore throat, choose hard candies that contain CBD when you\u2019re treating a cough. This allows you to try 2 natural treatments at once."

          "description":"Some evidence shows that inhaled CBD might act as a bronchodilator, so it may open your airways to help you breathe better. However, it\u2019s not a suitable replacement for an inhaler. If you want to try inhaled CBD to relieve a chronic cough, use a vape pen because it\u2019s the easiest and possibly the safest option. Attach a CBD oil cartridge to a vape pen battery, then follow the battery\u2019s instructions to take 1 puff. Stop using the vape pen immediately if your cough gets worse. You can purchase a vape pen battery and CBD cartridge at a dispensary, smoke shop, or online. The battery is the base of the vape pen, while the cartridge is the part that holds the CBD oil.Warning: Vaping may damage your lungs and respiratory system. Additionally, scientific evidence shows it might cause shortness of breath and chest pain."

          "description":"One of the few drawbacks of trying CBD is that there isn't a standard recommended dose. Experiment with your CBD products to find the right dose for you. Generally, it\u2019s best to start with a 10 mg dose to see if that works for you. If it doesn\u2019t, increase your dose by 10 mg until you feel the effects of the CBD. You likely won\u2019t feel the effects until you take at least 30 mg.\nKeep in mind that CBD doesn\u2019t have an upper threshold, so you don\u2019t need to worry about overdosing. However, you might experience side effects like diarrhea and fatigue if you take a dose that\u2019s high for you.

Alternatively, stir a spoonful of honey into a mug of tea for a soothing drink. You don\u2019t need to precisely measure the honey. Use a teaspoon or cereal spoon to take an approximate measurement. Never give honey to a baby who\u2019s under 1-year-old.

Choose a cough drop, throat drop, or hard candy, depending on your preference. Then, suck on the lozenge to help you produce more saliva and to coat your throat.
