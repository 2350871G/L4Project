  "text":" Making a Pocket in the Pita Bread Make a pocket. This is important because the bread will hold the contents that you're about to add, preventing them from falling out when the pita is eaten. Check the bread for positioning. Pita bread has a bottom and top; the bottom is generally thinner and often has wrinkles or cracks in it. Create the pocket in the pita. Tear around half the circumference of the pita, dividing the top and bottom (only half-way). Fold the loose bottom half down. This will, in effect, produce three layers of bread on one side and just the top layer on the other. Slip a hand in to release the top from the bottom in the closed half. The pocket is now ready to be filled up (and at the end you'll roll it up). Filling the Pita Pocket Place the pita pocket down on a clean work surface.  Add hummus. Spread a layer of hummus across the inside of the pita pocket. This makes for a tasty base that will help to keep the ingredients in place. Add salad vegetables. Typical additions include slices of tomato, shredded lettuce, salad onion slices, grated carrot, etc. Some things that go well in falafel: Cucumber and tomato salad (chopped thinly), pickles, cabbage salad (fresh or pickled), fried eggplants, green pepper, etc. Add tabouli. This is a staple for falafel pita pockets. Place two falafel balls in the middle. Flatten them with the back of a spoon or fork. They will spread across the pita pocket and be easier to eat than if left in large balls. Add tchina or tahini.  Add sauce. You can add any sauce you like. Typical sauces include sweet chili, tomato, garlic, cheese, barbecue, etc. Roll the falafel pocket up. It can now be eaten as it is, or if you want to wrap it in paper and take it on a picnic, that's fine too. Enjoy! Falafels go well with fries.",
