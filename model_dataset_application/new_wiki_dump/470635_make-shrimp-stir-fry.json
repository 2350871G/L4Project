If you\u2019re using a skillet instead of a wok, make sure that it\u2019s fairly deep so it has similar dimensions to a wok. When you add the oil to the pan, swirl it around once or twice to ensure that the entire bottom is coated."

Stir fry the shrimp for about 3 minutes or until they become pink. Use a slotted spoon to remove the shrimp, so you can place them on a plate and set aside. It\u2019s a good idea to pat the shrimp with paper towel before you add them to the pan. Excess moisture on the shrimp can cause the oil to splatter when you place them in the pan."
