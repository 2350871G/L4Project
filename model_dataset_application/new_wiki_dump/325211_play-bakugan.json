You\u2019ll eventually learn to strategize which Bakugans to play with, but when you first start, it\u2019s okay to pick whichever ones you like the most. Before you start playing, make sure all three Bakugans are closed so that they\u2019re in their ball shape. You\u2019ll roll them when you play, so they need to be closed. Set the three that you\u2019re playing with in front of you and put all the other Bakugans off to the side. You aren\u2019t allowed to switch out partway through the game."

          "description":"Look at your gate cards and choose one each of Gold, Copper (sometimes called Bronze), and Silver. Gate cards have colored circles on the side, which go along with the color of your Bakugan capsules. Pick gate cards with high numbers in the circles that match the colors of your Bakugans. For example, if your chosen Bakugans include one red, one blue, and one yellow, select gate cards with high numbers in the red, blue and yellow circles. You won\u2019t always get perfect matches, but try to find the best options. The gate cards are made of metal, so they are heavier than the ability cards."

Lay the cards facedown to your right until you are ready to play one of them. Blue cards add G-power during battle. Red cards are played during a roll to impact your roll or your opponent\u2019s roll. Green cards have many different functions."

They will lay theirs closer to you, as well. Keep the rest of your cards facedown in front of you, still unused. Each player sets their gate card down at the same time so the narrow sides of the cards are touching."

If your Bakugan doesn\u2019t land on the gate card and open, pick the Bakugan up and put it in your used pile. It does not stay in play for that round. The Bakugan counts if one of three things happens: it lands on the gate and opens; it lands on the gate but doesn\u2019t open; it opens on the gate but slides off of the card. If it lands on the card but doesn\u2019t open, move it around so that it opens. If it opens and slides off of the card, move it onto the card."

Your Bakugan\u2019s G-power score can be seen printed inside the opened Bakugan. For example, if you have a green Bakugan, find the green circle and add that number to your Bakugan\u2019s G-power score.

If you play an ability card and your opponent plays one, you are allowed to play another one or more cards. You rotate back and forth. If the first player doesn\u2019t wish to play a card, but the second player plays an ability card, the first player still has the option to play an ability card.
