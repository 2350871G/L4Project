Lift the door until it clears the hinges, then lower it to the floor carefully. If you're having trouble removing the door on your own, it may help to have someone else extract the hinge pin while you guide it off the hinges or vice-versa. It may be easier to stain sliding and swinging doors while they're still mounted due to the inconvenience of taking them down."

Doing your staining on a higher surface will spare your knees and back the discomfort of bending or stooping for long periods of time. If possible, set up your work area outdoors or in a well-ventilated garage or similar space to keep the fumes from the stain from becoming overpowering."

          "headline":"Remove all hardware from the door.",
          "description":"Disassemble the knob or handle, hinge plates, latches, locks, and any other fixtures that might get in the way while you're staining. The idea is to strip the door down to a single piece so you can work quickly and efficiently. Most door hardware can easily be removed using a screwdriver, but other tools like an adjustable wrench, pliers, and a hammer may also come in handy. Temporarily store screws and other small pieces in labelled bags or jars to avoid losing them."

          "description":"Soak up a small amount of mineral spirits with a clean cloth or sponge and scrub the entire surface of the door from top to bottom to prepare it to accept the new finish. Pay particular attention to areas showing signs of heavy buildup or discoloration. Allow the door to dry completely before moving on to applying the stain\u2014this should only take 2-3 minutes. A thorough wipedown will lift away any lingering dirt, dust, or grime that might prevent the new coat of stain from adhering. You can also use a basic all-purpose cleaner if you don't have any mineral spirits handy."

          "description":"If you're renewing a door that's been stained previously, it will be necessary to first get rid of the old finish. You can do this by slathering it with a thin coat of chemical solvent, which will slowly liquefy the dried stain. Let the solvent sit for 3-5 minutes, then wipe away all traces of chemical residue using a disposable rag. Chemical solvents give off harmful fumes, so be sure to wear a respirator or facemask and work in a well-ventilated area to minimize your exposure. Not all solvents are safe to use on fiberglass surfaces. Before you begin stripping the door, check the manufacturer's guidelines by visiting their website or calling their customer service line to find out which products they recommend."

Gel stains are thicker and creamier than other types of stains, which makes them better able to adhere to smooth synthetic materials and gives them a bold, uniform appearance. Look for gel stains in the pain aisle of your local home improvement center or hardware store. Gel stains are available in a variety of shades. This will allow you to simulate the look of different types of wood."

Be sure to work the stain deep into the imitation grain pattern or any other textural detailing. Always wear gloves when working with staining products. Not only will they keep your hands clean, they'll also keep you from transferring the oils on your skin to the door. Stir the stain thoroughly before you begin to ensure that it goes on with a consistent texture."

Some painters prefer to make an additional pass with a clean brush to pick up excess stain rather than using a separate rag."
