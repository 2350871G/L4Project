          "description":"It\u2019s tempting to post tons of photos on every major social media platform. However, this scattershot approach takes up a lot of time and can dilute your brand message. Instead, keep your finger on the social media pulse of the photo industry, both broadly and in your local area. Facebook used to be the social media platform of choice for professional photographers, but (as of 2019) Instagram is now the clear leader. Make Instagram your current priority, then, but be ready to move on to the next big thing in social media when it comes along."

          "description":"While you can sprinkle in candid photos and selfies, at least 75% of the photos you post on Instagram or elsewhere should be from dedicated photo sessions that support your brand message. Use social media as a simplified portfolio for potential clients by showcasing your specific skills and preferences. For instance, taking family photos on the beach may be your specialty. In this case, recruit friends and family for photo shoots that highlight your skills in this area."

          "description":"If baby photos are your specialty, for example, then advertising to 16 year-olds and 66 year-olds doesn\u2019t make a lot of economic sense. Instead, use the features available on your chosen social media platform(s) to direct your advertising to your most likely clientele. You can pay to advertise on Instagram, for example, and make sure your ads are being delivered to your most likely client base."

While it\u2019s tempting to try to save some money and do it all yourself, it nearly always pays off to hire a website designer and stick to your true area of expertise. Your website must make the right first impression on potential clients who end up there. Work closely with a pro to make sure your entire website is \u201con brand.\u201d\nHigh-quality SEO ensures that your ideal clients find your website near the top of their search results."

Your business name and contact information should be prominent, and it should be easy for customers to get in touch with you. Also offer a general idea of pricing for different types of photo sessions. Along with a business phone number, for instance, you might add a prominent \u201cAsk a question\u201d box that lets potential customers contact you by email. You don\u2019t have to list specific prices, but it helps to list a range like \u201cStarting at $150\u201d for a particular type of session."

Work with your website designer to ensure that the portfolio is easy to access and showcases some of your best work in a style that suits your brand message. This portfolio should be 100% professional photos that emphasize your skills, areas of expertise, and shooting style. You should also create a physical portfolio to show potential clients who visit your studio. It can roughly replicate your website portfolio or be a separate creation."

That said, you should take the time to identify your most likely customer base so that you can more effectively shape your brand and marketing plan to connect with them.

Make sure your business is clearly identified alongside the photos. If you do a great job, the coffee shop owner will be eager to show off the pictures and tell customers about you!
