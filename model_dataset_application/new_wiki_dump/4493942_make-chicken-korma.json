This will give the chicken an enhanced flavor, letting the marinade get to work. Mix it all together until you get a spicy, yoghurt-y concoction. It should be uniform and smooth."

To marinate, you can either place it all together in a resealable bag or just leave it covered in the refrigerator in the dish it's presently in.

Alternatively, you can use a food processor or hand blender to get the job done. For the record, in select markets, you can buy onions already in paste form."

If the chicken is at all pink, it still needs to finish cooking. Give it a few more minutes and come back, checking that piece and a new piece (one that hasn't been cut)."
