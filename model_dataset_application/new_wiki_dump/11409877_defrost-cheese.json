          "description":"Take your cheese out of the freezer. Look at the packaging carefully to ensure that it\u2019s still airtight. If the cheese wasn\u2019t frozen in an airtight container and was exposed to the air in your freezer, it won\u2019t be edible. Apart from being incredibly hard and flavorless, it may have absorbed bacteria from its exposure to the open air. When cheese has been exposed to air, it becomes oxidized. Cheese that has been exposed to the air for too long will become pale and firm. This is the best method for thawing cheese since it is the most likely to return your cheese to its former texture. Use this method if you\u2019re eating the cheese on its own, slicing it for sandwiches, or using it to garnish a dish. Placing cheese in the refrigerator avoids changing its flavor profile. It is more time consuming than defrosting it on the countertop though. Cheese that has been frozen for more than 6 months may not be edible."

          "description":"Leave the packaging on the cheese and do not unseal any zippers or take any tape off. Put the packaged cheese on a plate or baking tray. You can use a bowl or other rimmed container if you prefer. If you open the packaging, you\u2019ll be releasing the moisture that was trapped in the bag from when the cheese was originally frozen. This will make it even drier and more crumbly that it would normally be when it thaws."

Packages of deli slices can be left for 24 hours, while large bricks of cheese will require 48 hours to fully thaw.Tip: If you\u2019re worried about air getting into your packaging, place the cheese in the vegetable drawer to keep other food smells out."

          "description":"Take your cheese out of the fridge and remove the packaging. Check to see if it\u2019s thawed by trying to cut a piece off. If it cuts easily, it\u2019s fully thawed. Either eat it or throw it in with your recipe to avoid letting it spoil. You can let the cheese come to room temperature before removing it from the packaging if you want to spread it or don\u2019t want to eat your cheese cold. Be careful though, since cheese will start to go bad if you leave it out for more than 4 hours. When cheese starts to go bad, it will start to smell, change color, and taste sour or bitter. You will undoubtedly notice a change in texture after you thaw your cheese when compared to unfrozen cheese of the same variety. The freezing and thawing process typically makes the cheese more crumbly and harder. The softer the cheese is, the quicker it will go bad once it reaches room temperature. Soft cheeses that have been left at room temperature for more than 4 hours should be thrown out. Hard cheeses should be discarded after 6 hours. Soft cheeses include brie, gorgonzola, feta, and ricotta. Hard cheeses include cheddar, provolone, gouda, and Romano. If you\u2019re cooking with it, you can usually cook the cheese when it\u2019s frozen. If you\u2019re melting it or throwing it in a recipe, you don\u2019t necessarily need to thaw it."
