      "description":"This means if you want a one-word username, a two-word username, one with numbers, etc. One-word usernames can be hard to figure out if you want it to make sense and able for people to pronounce it, but it is a great way if you want your username to be simple. Adding more words increases the chances of getting an available username, but it makes it a bit more complex and long (if you want a short username). Adding numbers are great to make it more unique, but if you're trying to \"be like the rest\", use numbers wisely, or not add them at all."

For example, you have the words Whisperer and Tiger. Are you going to put in WhispererTiger or TigerWhisperer?"

      "description":"These can add style to your username and if used properly, it won't make much of a difference. The letter \"x\" is commonly used to replace certain letters, mostly vowels to make the person easily read the username. For example, if Legitamite is taken, you could replace the first \"e\" with \"x\", like Lxgitamite. The letter \"v\" is mostly only used to replace \"u\", like Pvmpkins instead of Pumpkins. It is rarely used to replace other letters. Numbers can replace letters as well. Since \"3\" looks like a backward \"E\", it is used to replace \"E/e\"."

      "headline":"Use capital and lowercase letters wisely.",
      "description":"If your username consists of 2 or more words, capital usernames are useful. For instance, if you're thinking of the username, \"MostlyAnna\", capitalizing the first letters of each word organizes it rather than having a username with all lowercase letters, such as \"mostlyanna\". If you want a one-word name, capitalizing the first letter wouldn't matter, as people won't have trouble reading it."
