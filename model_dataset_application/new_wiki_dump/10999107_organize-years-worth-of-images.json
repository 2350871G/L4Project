Ultimately, you will need all your photos to be in one place, ideally backed up on one hard drive or in one account on the 'cloud'. But first, you need to identify where all your images are, so you can get the scans and files together. Collect them from wherever you can. You may have hard copies at home or in relatives' houses, you may have them stored in albums, or you may have them uploaded to various web sites, like Flickr, SmugMug, Facebook, or Instagram. Dig up any CDs, thumb drives, or hard drives that might have images on them. Use your File Management system to get them all in one place. Speed wise, parking your data on your hard drive is going to be the most convenient. Check any online photo/file storage accounts that you have. You could have set your phone to back up to any, or all, of them to the cloud. You might have some on Flickr, Amazon Photos, OneDrive, DropBox, or Google Photos."
