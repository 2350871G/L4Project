It is usually located on the left side of the snow blower and is secured in place with bolts located at each corner. Remove the old drive belt. Push down on the belt idler pulley, the brushed metal plate that holds the belt on and gently pull the belt off biggest pulley before taking it off any other pulley. Attach the new belt. Wrap one end of the new belt around the smallest pulley in the compartment, making sure the white letters are facing outwards.
