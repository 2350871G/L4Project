          "description":"Boiling an egg protects the nutrients contained in the yolk from oxidation and is an easy, healthy option for preparing a meal or snack. Simply place the egg in a pot of boiling water and remove it once the egg has hardened to your preference. Depending on your stovetop, a soft-boiled egg usually takes between 3 and 6 minutes. A hard-boiled egg typically takes 10 to 15 minutes. Boiled eggs are a great breakfast option and make a tasty addition to many types of salads. Hard-boiled eggs are a great option for egg and potato salads. You can also add hard-boiled eggs to a nutritious cobb salad."

          "description":"Poaching is another healthy option for cooking your eggs. Simply crack your eggs into a shallow pan of water and simmer the eggs for 3 to 5 minutes. You may also choose to add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of vinegar to the simmering water to help the eggs set properly. To avoid Salmonella, you should always choose fresh eggs when poaching. To test for freshness, place your eggs in a bowl of water. If it is fresh, the egg will sink. If it is past its prime, the egg will bob or float. Poached eggs are a great breakfast option. They are particularly popular in eggs benedict."

          "description":"If you want to cut down on the amount of oil that you use to cook your eggs, consider baking them. Simply place the eggs in a greased or non-stick pan, add healthy toppings, and bake the eggs for about 10 to 15 minutes at 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius). This method limits the amount of unhealthy fats that you will eat from cooking oils. To promote your overall health, consider using a non-stick pan. Otherwise, you may need to add calories by using cooking spray, butter, or ghee to grease the pan. Shakshuka is a healthy baked egg breakfast common throughout North Africa and the Middle East."

If you like the taste, a small amount of coconut oil is also a good frying option because it does not oxidize at high heat. Consider using a non-stick pan to limit the amount of oil that you need to fry your eggs."

Onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, peppers, and avocados will add flavor and healthy vitamins and nutrients to your egg dishes. You can add raw vegetables to an omelette or eat them as a side with your eggs. Salsa is a healthy option that can add a lot of flavor to your eggs. Make a simple, veggie-packed scramble by adding some spinach, sweet peppers, and diced onions to your eggs as you scramble them. The dish will cook together and create a delicious and nutritious meal."

Turkey, bacon, or chicken sausages can be a healthy alternative to pork sausage and bacon. However, they can be higher in sodium. You can also trim the excess fat from your meats to make them healthier. For example, if you make a Cobb salad, consider using turkey bacon instead of traditional pork bacon. As a rule of thumb, try to limit the amount of cured meats you eat. Try not to eat more than two slices of bacon or two sausage links with your breakfast."

Grains like rice and quinoa will help you stay full and are a healthy source of energy to fuel your day. You might also want to consider sprouted grain breads made from wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, or brown rice. These breads may provide some protein and often have a low caloric content. Consider making a delicious quinoa egg bake to get some healthy protein and whole grains."
