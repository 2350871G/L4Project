In cooler climates where the ground does freeze in winter, potatoes should be planted two weeks after the last frost. Potatoes won\u2019t start growing until the soil temperature reaches 45\u00b0 F (7\u00b0 C), so don\u2019t plant the seed potatoes before the last frost."

          "headline":"Amend the soil.",
          "description":"The best kind of soil for growing potatoes is loose soil that\u2019s slightly acidic. The ideal pH is between 5.0 and 7.0, and you can increase the acidity by tilling aged manure, mature compost, or high-potash fertilizer into the soil. Tilling the soil will also break everything up and ensure the soil is nice and loose for the potatoes."

Two weeks before your set planting date, lay out your seed potatoes somewhere that gets plenty of light, and that\u2019s between 60 and 70\u00b0 F (15.5 and 21\u00b0 C). Leave the potatoes there in the light to sprout until it\u2019s time to plant. Use small but healthy potatoes for seed potatoes. If your seed potato is larger than a chicken egg, you can cut it in half or thirds. There should be at least two eyes or sprouts per piece. You can grow any variety of potato you like, but make sure you're using spray-free potatoes that haven't been treated with a sprout-inhibitor. This will prevent the potato from sprouting, and you won\u2019t be able to grow a new plant from it."

The rows should be just deep enough to hold the potatoes. Space the rows so they're 3 feet (0.91 m) (91 cm) apart. Potatoes grown in rows in the ground will produce good yields, as long as the soil is of good quality."

This is called hilling, and it will protect the potatoes from sunburn and support the plants as they grow. Hill the potatoes again every time the plants grow another 6 inches (15 cm). Potatoes that are exposed to sunlight produce a toxic chemical called solanine, which appears as a green layer on the outside of the tuber."
