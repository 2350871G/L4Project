Use detergents that create a small amount of suds, and are specifically made for highly efficient machines. Powder detergents usually tend to be less sudsy than liquid detergents. Also, don't exceed the recommended amount of detergent. Sometimes, even less detergent works better for cleaning your clothes. Avoiding fabric softener. Fabric softeners that come in liquid form tend to leave a residue that supports mold growth. Instead of using liquid fabric softener, consider using dryer sheets or dryer balls to give your clothes a softer feel. Drying the gasket. Use a rag to wipe everywhere surround the gasket, and inside the grooves of the rubber gasket. Ideally, you should try to wipe the gasket after every washing cycle. If you\u2019re not going to wipe and clean the gasket after every wash, you should try to regularly wipe the gasket every week or so to remove trapped mold. Doing a bleach cycle. Run a hot water and bleach cycle once a month. This is a good opportunity to disinfect your washer, but also to wash heavily soiled items like work cloths and grimy towels."
