Consider a machine with an output greater than 200 amps if you will be welding aluminum daily."

          "headline":"Use aluminum electrodes.",
          "description":"Electrode thickness is especially critical with aluminum and there is an extremely narrow range to consider. Thinner wire is more difficult to feed, while thicker wire requires greater current to melt. The electrodes for welding aluminum should be .035 of an inch in diameter (less than 1 mm). One of the best choices is 4043 aluminum. A harder alloy like 5356 aluminum is easier to feed, but will require more current."

Aluminum expands more than steel as it\u2019s heated. This means the contact tips will need larger holes than the ones used for steel wire of the same size. However, the holes should still be small enough to provide good electrical contact. U-shaped drive rolls. Aluminum feeders should use drive rolls that won\u2019t shave aluminum wire. The inlet and outlet guides for these feeders shouldn\u2019t shave the softer aluminum wire. In contrast, steel feeders use V-shaped drive rolls, which are specifically designed to shave the wire. Non-metallic liners, which will further reduce the friction on the wire as it goes through the feeder."
