For example, you should use a car-specific wash when cleaning your car's exterior. A simple household cleaner should be fine for use on chrome. If in doubt, check the label of the cleaner you're going to use. It should have some indication for materials it can and can't be used on."

Focus on cleaning a section of chrome before moving onward. In order to prevent marks or streaks, dry the area with a separate cloth when you're done with each area. In case the water is hot to the touch, you should only put the end of your cloth in. When the water and soap run out, you can simply dip it in again."

For the vast majority of them, applying your soapy water to an old toothbrush and scrubbing the nooks will get the dirt off. Although the toothbrush can be old, make sure that the majority of the bristles are still intact.
