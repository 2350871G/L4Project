  "text":" Mapping Out the Border Type Determine the size and shape of your desired garden border. Maybe you'd like random shapes created from rugged, odd shaped broken plates. Or perhaps you'd prefer cleanly broken halves that all match in size and shape. Make this decision before cutting/breaking the plates or salvaging broken pieces. Decide if you want one or multiple designed plates. You can choose between an eclectic mixture of any broken plate design you can lay your hands on. Or, you can be more precise and select plates only with the same pattern, to give a more uniform and formal appearance to the border. Again, decide before selecting plates and broken pieces. Consider whether you want to repurpose old or already broken plates or if you want to use a new set. If you\u2019ve broken one or two plates of your set in the past and can no longer use that set, you could break the remaining plates to use as your border. Or, if you don\u2019t possess the pattern or color you desire, go to a garage sale or thrift store for plates in order to score the best deal possible. This is a great opportunity to get rid of chipped or cracked plates that you no longer want to use. Decide on the best plate size. Which size best suits your needs? Teacup saucers, side plates or dinner plates? For extra large borders, think serving or carving plates. Match plate size to the area of border needing to be covered. Choosing the Border Shape and Length Choose the plate's border shape. The neatest border will consist of a simple half moon shape (semi circle). If you want a different shape than this, it will take more work and if there are jagged pieces involved, there is a risk of injury to garden users, people and pets alike. If using rugged, already broken pieces, aim to place sharp points down into the soil, leaving only soft, non-sharp edges facing upward. Determine the length of the border. You\u2019ll need to know how much land you\u2019ll be covering with the border to know how many plates to prepare for the border. Usually you'll get at least two pieces of the border from one plate if using the simple half moon shape. Cutting the Plates Use an appropriate tool to make precision cuts. The tool must be able to cut through porcelain without spidering or smashing the plate. Recommended tools include a band saw, a wet tile saw, a hammer with nippers, a tile cutter or wheeled nippers. If you don't want to do the cutting yourself, contact your local hardware or craft store to inquire about professional cutting. They may let bring your plate set in for cutting if you don\u2019t have the right tool. Carefully break or cut each plate into the border shape. In this case, the simple half moon shape is used. Place the finished cut plates that will be used as a border in a separate area while cutting the remainder of the plates. Make sure the plates cannot be disturbed by children or pets (they could break again if moved or dropped). Creating the Border Lay the plates out around the circumference of the are to be bordered. You\u2019ll want to see how the prepared plates look once laid out around the garden before you embed them into the soil. Tip the first plate upward and carefully push it into the dirt. Push it deeply enough so that the plate can stand up by itself and feels sturdy but not so deeply as to disappear and show very little of the pattern. If necessary, obtain a small shovel to dig a shallow trench before embedding plate.  Continue propping up the border plates and embedding them into the soil. Continue until you've gone around the perimeter of the garden are you've mapped out for the border. Finished. ",
