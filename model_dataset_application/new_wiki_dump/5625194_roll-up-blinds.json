If your blinds have this feature, the cord will stay put automatically when you let go of it, so you don't need to tie off the cord. This is a built-in feature that some blinds have. It works the same way as the cord on mini blinds. Tie off the cord on a hook, if you have one. Some blinds need to be tied on a hook to keep them from unrolling. If your blinds are like this, make several loops around the hook to keep it secure. If you can, tie the cord in a figure 8 pattern for added security. This hook is sometimes called a \"cleat.\" Using Spring-Loaded Blinds Grasp the bottom of the blinds at the center. You\u2019ll be able to trigger the spring in the blinds more easily if you\u2019re holding it at the center. If you hold it too much to the left or right, the blinds may only roll up on one side. Your blinds may get damaged if they roll up on one side but not the other. Pull the end of the blinds down and slightly forward. Tug the blinds gently to trigger the spring. At this point, your blinds should be coming away from your window at a slight angle. You may need to tug it down several times before you trigger the spring.Tip: Don\u2019t let the blinds go while they\u2019re rolling up. Otherwise, the blinds can get damaged. Guide the blinds as they roll back up. They will roll back up on their own, but it\u2019s best to hold the end of the blinds as this happens. This way you can make sure the blinds don\u2019t roll up too quickly, which can result in damage or uneven blinds. Let go of the blinds once the end reaches the top or your desired height. If you want them to roll all the way up, you can just let go. However, if you want to stop the blinds partway up, let them roll up to just above where you want them. Then, lower the blinds back toward the window. Finally, tug the blinds down until they're in the right spot and let them go. Tying Up Blinds Grab the bottom of the blinds with both hands. It\u2019s best to position your hands at about shoulder-width apart. This will allow you to create a more even roll. However, hold your blinds in whatever way is most comfortable to you. Roll up the blinds to the height you prefer. Fold up the bottom edge, then slowly roll up the curtains until you reach your desired height. Go slowly so you can make sure each layer is even with the last. It\u2019s up to you how tightly you want to roll up your blinds. You might like the look of tightly rolled blinds, or you might prefer loosely rolled blinds. Either way works. Tie off the ribbon or cord on each side of the blinds.
