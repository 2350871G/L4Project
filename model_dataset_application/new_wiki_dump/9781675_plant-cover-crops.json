          "description":"You can purchase a DIY soil-testing kit from a nursery, which gives you a general idea of your soil\u2019s levels. For a more accurate assessment, you can pay to send a soil sample to a professional lab. After you receive the results, pick your cover crop based on what your soil needs to balance its deficiencies. Some common adjustments include providing nitrogen, adding organic matter, improving soil structure, reducing soil erosion, and providing weed control. Common areas for soil deficiency include nitrogen, phosphorous, or aeration."

Their root systems also help them to break up thick clay soil and stay extremely hardy against the cold. The easiest grasses to grow include rye (annual or cereal) and buckwheat."

          "description":"Pick from a wide selection of legumes, such as clovers (crimson, red, Dutch white, berseem, sweet, and more), hairy vetch, fava beans, bell beans, and Austrian winter peas. Legumes are perfect for replacing the nitrogen that previous crops may have taken from the soil. In fact, legumes can produce up to 300 pounds (140 kg) of nitrogen per acre of soil. If the seed company hasn\u2019t pre-inoculated them, you\u2019ll need to inoculate your legume seeds 24 hours prior to planting. This process involves coating all of the seeds with rhizobacteria to increase nitrogen production."

Brassicas, such as oilseed radish and mustard, are known for having 4 feet (1.2 m) roots that chisel and loosen compacted soil. Buckwheat is perfect for accumulating phosphorus in the soil, and phacelia is great for attracting bees in early spring for pollination."

You can either make your own pairing, checking first that the 2 seeds are compatible, or purchase a pre-formulated blend. Most seed companies offer these special blends so you don\u2019t have to worry about proportions. Some good combinations include vetch with oats, Austrian peas with winter wheat, and garden peas with rye. One of the most effective legume-grass blends is the field pea and oat combination. You get the best of both worlds\u2014nitrogen and organic matter\u2014and the 2 plants even have complementary growth habits."

Purchase a specific inoculant based on the packaging instructions, then wet the seeds with non-chlorinated water. Mix them with the inoculant in a wheelbarrow or plastic pail until they\u2019re fully coated. You can either plant the seeds right away or let them dry in the shade for 24 hours.

If your soil is well-aerated and broken up already, you only need to loosen it with a garden rake. If your soil is compacted, you\u2019ll need to till it at least 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) down.

Some crops need to be mowed at a specific time. For example, winter annual rye will only die from mowing if you cut it after it creates a seed head, but before it releases its seeds.
