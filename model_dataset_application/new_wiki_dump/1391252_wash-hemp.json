Machine washing and especially drying has a tendency to weaken hemp more quickly, losing the texture and strength that many people love about hemp clothing and other items. If you plan to wash your hemp fabric by hand, use a gentle, all-natural detergent and make sure to rinse thoroughly. Tom's soap works great for washing hemp items. Residual soap can leave cellulose, which oxidizes and leaves large brown spots on hemp, making it very important to soak hemp items in clean water thoroughly for a while after washing them."

If you need to get it softened faster, you can use a commercial softener, or just soak the hemp to let the fibers soften over time. If you want to soften hemp quickly, throwing it in the washer and dryer is perfectly fine. Use hot water to slowly ease open the hemp fibers and tumble dry it a few times to get it feeling soft quickly. Hemp should come out of the dryer soft and fluffy as any fabric."
