Compare the guest count to the cake size and take note of how many pieces you will ultimately need to cut, then plan your cuts so that the number of pieces will slightly exceed the number of guests\nDetermine if you can cut the entire cake with fishing wire. In the event of a staggered layer cake you may need to disassemble the cake and before you cut it. For a traditional double layer cake, though, the fishing wire method will work well."
