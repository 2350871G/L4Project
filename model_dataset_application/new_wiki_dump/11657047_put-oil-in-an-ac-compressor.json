Check behind the large hoses that may be obstructing your view of the compressor. If you can\u2019t find your AC compressor, check your owner\u2019s manual or look up the make and model of your vehicle online to identify its location. Park the vehicle on level ground and make sure the parking brake is engaged. You could potentially shock yourself if the engine is active while you\u2019re removing the compressor."

Park the vehicle on level ground and make sure the parking brake is engaged. You could potentially shock yourself if the engine is active while you\u2019re removing the compressor. Jack up your vehicle and remove the tire near the compressor. Use a vehicle jack and place it beneath a jack point on the vehicle\u2019s frame, near the front tire.
