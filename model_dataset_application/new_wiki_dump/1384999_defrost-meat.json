Additionally, you don\u2019t have to worry about cooking thinner portions of the food or overheating the meat. However, it can take a long time for food to thaw, especially larger meats like a turkey or a pork roast. If you don\u2019t have at least 24 hours to wait for the meat to defrost, choose a faster method."

If the cut of meat is very large, such as a turkey or roast, place it on a large pan. Leave on any plastic packaging. This will protect the meat from falling food or debris in your refrigerator."

After the first 24 hours, check the meat periodically to see if it\u2019s thawed. Poke the meat through the plastic or turn it over to see whether or not it\u2019s done thawing.

For example:\nPoultry, fish, and ground meat can be kept in the refrigerator for an additional 1-2 days. Beef, pork, lamb, or veal will keep for another 3-5 days in the refrigerator."
