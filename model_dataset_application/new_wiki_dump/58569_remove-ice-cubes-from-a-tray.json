With one hand, flex the tray away from you while flexing it toward you with the other hand. Release the flex, then twist the sides in the other direction. Flexing the tray like this allows air to enter between the ice and the tray, which will release the cubes from their pockets. If you have an old metal tray with a lever on it, pull up the lever to shift the metal divisions and release the ice."

The liquid on your finger will freeze upon contact with the ice and form a bond, so when you lift your finger, the ice cube will easily come out of its pocket attached to your finger. To get the cube off, simply dip the tip of your finger into your drink and allow the bond to melt."

If necessary, give the bottom of the tray a quick bang with your hand if some of the cubes are still stuck."

However, some newer ice cube trays are made of a pliable silicone, and these can be great for ice because you can actually poke or pinch the bottom of each ice cube pocket to release it from the tray. To remove ice cubes from a silicone tray, flex both sides of the tray to loosen the cubes. Hold the tray in both hands, and place an index or middle finger under a single ice cube on the bottom of the tray. Push against the bottom of the cube with that finger, and the ice cube will pop out. Grab it with your other hand while still pushing it from the bottom. Silicone trays work best when they are clean and don\u2019t have a cloudy residue inside, so wash them out with hot soapy water and a brush between every filling."
