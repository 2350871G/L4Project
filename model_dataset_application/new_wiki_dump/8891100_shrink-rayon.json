Soak a bath towel in water, lay the rayon flat on the towel, and then roll the towel up and let it sit so that the moisture can soak into the fabric. Try this method first if you're worried about shrinking your garment too much. If you want it shrunken more, you can always resort to one of the other methods for your second attempt."
