          "description":"If you have more butter than this, such as 2 parts butter to 3 parts flour, the butter will quickly melt as the cookies bake, causing them to spread. That's why it's important to find a recipe that balances the ratio of butter to flour.Tip: You can also experiment with using some vegetable shortening instead of all butter. Shortening holds its shape well, but butter has better flavor so you might like using a combination of both. For example, try a sugar cookie recipe that uses 1 cup (226 g) of butter and 3 cups  (360 g) of flour."

          "description":"Your sugar cookie dough is actually acidic, but if you add baking soda as a raising agent, it neutralizes the acidity and makes the cookies spread. Baking powder is acidic, so it helps the dough keep its shape. Ensure that you're using baking powder that hasn't expired or your cookies won't develop a soft rise."

          "description":"You've probably seen cookie recipes that call for powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar. Unfortunately, since powdered sugar is so fine, it melts faster which makes your cookies spread. To help the cookies keep their shape, use granulated sugar. You could also try cane sugar since it's less refined and coarser than granulated sugar."

          "headline":"Measure all of your recipe ingredients carefully when you make the dough.",
          "description":"Since baking recipes are a specific balance of butter, flour, sugar, and leaveners, it's critical to weigh out each ingredient instead of eyeballing amounts. For example, to measure flour, scoop a measuring cup into your flour container and run the flat edge of a knife across the top to level it. Sugar cookies can spread if there's not enough flour, so measure accurately. If they're still spreading, add an extra 2 tablespoons (30 g) of flour to your dough. Use a kitchen scale to weigh out your ingredients to get the most accurate result."

          "headline":"Beat the butter and sugar for a full 5 minutes.",
          "description":"Your recipe probably tells you to cream the butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. If you're unsure what that means and your cookies have been spreading, you probably need to beat the butter and sugar longer. Beat the mixture on medium speed for 5 minutes and scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally. Use room temperature butter since it will beat easily. Don't make dough with melted butter because it won't hold its shape in the oven. Beating or creaming the butter and sugar makes the dough less dense so the fat and sugar don't melt as quickly. This helps the cookies hold their shape better."

Just place the cookies on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and stick them in the fridge while you preheat the oven.
