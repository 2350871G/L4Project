Choosing a quiet dog that does not react and bark at every sound, noise, or movement they detect will keep both you and your neighbors happy. However, keep in mind that many smaller toy breeds can often be noisy. Pugs, Bulldogs, and Whippets are known for being quieter, smaller breeds. Be sure to avoid guardian breeds. Guardian breeds are most likely to be territorial and react to almost every noise and movement. Common guardian breeds are Boxers, Rottweilers, Dobermans, and German Shepherds. All dogs vary, even if their breed is known for being quiet. Consult your shelter to see if the specific dog you are considering is actually quiet."
