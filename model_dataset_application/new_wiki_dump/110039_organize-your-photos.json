Collect every external hard drive that you own and plug them into your computer one at a time. Cut every photo on your external drives and paste them into your new folder.

If you don\u2019t have a good reason for holding on to these images, there\u2019s no reason to let them take up space on your computer.

Inside of each year\u2019s folder, create additional subfolders for the events that took place each year. Alternatively, you can create a folder for every month of the year. This can make it hard to find images if you don\u2019t have a good memory, though. For example you could have a folder labelled \u201c2012.\u201d Inside of this folder, you can add folders with names like \u201cJanuary,\u201d \u201cJanuary-April,\u201d or \u201cJanuary Amy\u2019s Family Gathering.\u201d When you pick a labeling system, use it consistently across the board to keep things consistent."

There are no right or wrong ways to do this, so choose the method that makes the most sense to you. Label folders with keywords, not complete sentences.

          "description":"Computer files are always arranged alphabetically by default. This makes organizing your folders harder, since \u201cApril\u201d will appear in front of \u201cJanuary\" and your description labels won\u2019t be chronological. To keep the images in order, put a 2- or 3-digit number in front of each folder to arrange them in a way that makes sense to you. For example, if \u201cVacation Malaysia Jennifer and Steve\u201d is the oldest set of images, name it \u201c001 Vacation Malaysia Jennifer and Steve.\u201d If you\u2019re sorting images chronologically, use  \u201c001 January,\u201d \u201c002 February,\u201d and so on. Whether you use 2- or 3-digit numerical labels depends on how many folders you have. Even if you use keywords to sort your subfolders, you should still try to keep the images relatively chronological. It will be much easier to find what you\u2019re looking for when you go to find an image."
