The game calculates the chance for an egg every 256 steps you take in the world. You can increase the speed by riding your bike instead of walking. Receive your egg. Once you get an egg, you'll need to hatch it. This can take a little while, and you won't know what's inside until it hatches. By breeding Pok\u00e9mon from two different regions, your chances for a Shiny go from 1/8192 to 1/1024 (8x more likely). Fishing Understand how fishing streaks work. Pok\u00e9mon X and Y introduced the concept of \"fishing streaks\". This requires you to continuously hook wild Pok\u00e9mon without pulling up nothing or messing up the reel timing. Increasing your streak will increase the chances of catching a Shiny. Gather your equipment. Make sure you have plenty of Pok\u00e9Balls, as well as a fishing rod. You don't need special rods to perform streaks, but the rod you use will determine the level and type of Pok\u00e9mon that you can catch. Prepare your party. You will need Pok\u00e9mon that can beat any Pok\u00e9mon that you catch on the rod. You will also want a Pok\u00e9mon with \"Suction Cups\" or \"Sticky Hold\" to be the first Pok\u00e9mon in your party. This will increase the odds of hooking a wild Pok\u00e9mon, which is essential for fishing streaks. Find a good location. You can increase your chances for hooking a Pok\u00e9mon by fishing in an enclosed water tile. For example, if you're fishing from the back of a Pok\u00e9mon, try to find a tile that is surrounded by the land, a rock, you, and an unfishable deep water tile. Start fishing. Once you've found a good spot, cast your line to start fishing. Press \"A\" as soon as you see the notice that you have a Pok\u00e9mon on the line. Any of the following messages or actions will cause the streak to end:\n\"Nothing seems to be biting...\" - This is a random occurrence, but can be mitigated by fishing in an enclosed spot. \"No! You reeled in too fast!\" - You pressed the A button too soon. \"No! You reeled in too slow!\" - You pressed the A button too late. Leaving the area. Starting a battle outside of fishing. Quitting the game. Keep trying. As long as you are successfully hooking Pok\u00e9mon, your streak will increase. This will increase the odds of finding a Shiny, up to a certain point. Because it is random, there is still the chance that you will not find a Shiny, even after successfully catching numerous Pok\u00e9mon with your rod. Getting Shiny Starters and Legendaries Save right before picking your starting Pok\u00e9mon or starting a Legendary battle. There is a very small chance that the Pok\u00e9mon you pick will be Shiny. Save right before picking or starting the battle. Pick the Pok\u00e9mon or start the fight with the Legendary. If the Pok\u00e9mon is not Shiny, restart your game. This will not work on Legendaries in Pok\u00e9mon X, Y, and some Legendary Pok\u00e9mon in Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire, Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. Load your save and try again. This is a long and very time consuming process. Some people have reported it taking over 1000 tries. If you keep trying, however, you may be able to get a Shiny starter or Legendary. If the Legendary fight is one where the Pok\u00e9mon will automatically run, it will still be Shiny when you meet it later. SOS Chaining Load up your copy of Pok\u00e9mon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun or Ultra Moon. This will only work on these games. Make sure you know the Pok\u00e9mon you're hunting well. If it knows moves such as Explosion or Double Edge, then make sure to prepare for it. Check if the Pok\u00e9mon can call for help--if not, then this method won't work on it. To counter self-destructing moves, use a Pok\u00e9mon with the ability Damp. To counter recoil moves, use Skill Swap with a Pok\u00e9mon with the ability Rock Head or use a Ghost type, as these moves are usually Normal-type. Get some Adrenaline Orbs to allow easier chaining. They increase the odds of Pok\u00e9mon calling for help. Having Pok\u00e9mon call for help more will increase the speed of finding your shiny. Have a Pokemon with the move False Swipe or Hold Back on your team. False Swipe is TM54, and a wide array of Pok\u00e9mon can learn it. Encounter the target Pok\u00e9mon you want the shiny of. It has to be a Pok\u00e9mon you can encounter naturally in the wild, so Ultra Beasts, the Tapus, and Legendary Pok\u00e9mon will not work with this method. Once you find your target, lower its HP to 50% or less. Make sure not to knock it out. At low HP, the Pok\u00e9mon will start to call for help. This is the start of your hunt. Knock out every Pok\u00e9mon that is called that is NOT shiny whenever a new Pok\u00e9mon is called into battle. You can tell if it's not shiny if it stays the same color as usual. Switch Pokemon every 30 to 100 SOS calls. Do so by using False Swipe on the next Pok\u00e9mon called and knock out the original caller. Knock out the original caller when it's running out of moves--this is why you need to prepare. However, do not swap callers if the other Pok\u00e9mon isn't the same species as the one you are hunting for. Rinse and repeat until you find the shiny, then catch it. The shiny will sparkle as it enters the battlefield. Ultra Wormholes Start up your Pokemon Ultra Sun or Ultra Moon game. This method only works for these games. (Optional tip) Go to the Game Freak Headquarters on Akala Island. After you have completed the main story mode and defeated the Elite-Four, you can choose either to change how you control Solgaleo/ Lunala through the Ultra Wormhole through two options. 1. Motion Controls or 2. Circle-Pad Controls. This is for better accuracy if you are not comfortable using motion controls. Go to the Altar of the Sun/or Moon. You need to have successfully defeated the Elite-Four to and completed the story mode. Enter through the wormhole. This is located in the front of the Sun/Moon symbol on the ground. Choose Enter the Ultra Wormhole. Catching the shiny Pokemon. There are 20 Pokemon you can catch shiny. You have a higher chance of encountering a shiny Pokemon if you travel farther into the Ultra Wormhole. The more rings a hole has, the rarer the Pokemon. But be careful! If you see a Wormhole with three rings and more smaller rings, that indicates a legendary Pokemon. Unless you are shiny hunting a legendary, do not enter through this Wormhole. See Getting Shiny Starters and Legendaries for catching legendary Pokemon in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.",
