If the edge falls on a longer centimeter line marked with a whole number, the object is that many centimeters long. For example, if the edge of an eraser ends at the line marked 7, the eraser is 7 cm long. If you are measuring to the nearest centimeter, look for the nearest line to the edge of the object that is marked with a number. This mark will tell you the nearest centimeter. For example, an eraser might fall less than halfway between the 7 and 8 cm marks. Since the eraser ends closer to the 7 cm mark, you would say that, to the nearest centimeter, the eraser is 7 centimeters long."

Estimating Centimeters Using Objects Note a few objects that are roughly 1 cm wide.

The easiest objects to use are a standard pencil, pen, or highlighter. The width of a pencil is close to 1 cm. Other options include the length of a staple, the width of five CDs or DVDs stacked together, the thickness of a standard notepad, and the radius of a U.S. penny. Place the object you are measuring on a sheet of paper. Make sure that the entire item fits on the paper. Mark its starting edge with a pencil or pen. The paper needs to be light in color so that you can clearly see the marks being made. Place the measuring object at the starting edge.

One side of the pencil should be flush against the starting edge of the measured item. Mark the opposite edge of the measuring object. Being careful not to move it, make a small mark against the inside edge of the measuring object with a pencil or pen. Shift the position of the measuring object.

So, 2.78 kilometers is the same distance as 278,000 centimeters. Converting U.S. Standard Units to Centimeters Convert inches to centimeters. In 1 inch there are 2.54 centimeters. To convert inches to centimeters, multiply the number of inches by 2.54. For example, to convert 9.41 inches to centimeters, you would calculate 9.41\u00d72.54=23.9{\\displaystyle 9.41\\times 2.54=23.9}. Thus, 9.41 inches is the same length as 23.9 centimeters.
