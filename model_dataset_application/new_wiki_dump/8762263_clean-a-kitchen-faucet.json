Do not use a sponge to apply the solution, because sponges collect bacteria and germs rapidly. For vinegar mix equal parts white vinegar and water and use a clean rag to apply the solution. Vinegar is a safe, natural disinfectant that is kills most problematic bacteria. For a bleach solution, mix one tablespoon of bleach with a quart of water.
