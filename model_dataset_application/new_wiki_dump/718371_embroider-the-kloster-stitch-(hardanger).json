      "description":"For clarity and accuracy, you may make square shapes on the fabric with a colored chalk to guide you through the stitches with directions. The couching thread which sits first on the fabric is sewn on with another thread. Thus forming a pattern gradually as you progress. You must make sure that all the laid threads be parallel to each other for Kloster stitching. If the laid thread is vertical, keep all the read of the laid threads placed vertically. If you start off with the laid thread horizontally, continue with all the laid thread horizontally. To hold the fabric well in your hands, you may also use an embroidery hoop. This hoop will fix and hold the fabric open and free from creases."

The lace stitch is made by working in a single buttonhole stitch in the center mesh of each of the 4 sides of the kloster block. To make sure the stitch is going well, maintain the thread work firm. It should not be too tight with no space nor should it be too loose with extra thread puffing up. Maintain just about the perfect pull while making Kloster stitches."
