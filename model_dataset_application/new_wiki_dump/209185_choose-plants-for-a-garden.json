          "description":"Gardeners in cool, temperate regions will have the best luck with resilient flowers and shrubs like sorrels, daylilies and ostrich fern. These plants are better equipped to survive low or drastically fluctuating temperatures than their warm-weather counterparts. Plants that favor frigid conditions tend to be woody and have little colorful foliage. You can find more information on the different climate zones and where you fall within them online."

          "headline":"Grow heat-tolerant plants in tropical and subtropical climates.",
          "description":"If you live someplace where it's warm and humid year round, stick to species that do well in steamier environments. Some good examples are amaranths, various species of ferns, and the ever-popular orchid, which can't seem to get enough heat and moisture. The thick, waxy leaves of spider plants and aloe make them well-adapted to warmer zones. When chosen for container gardening, you can easily shuffle them around to where the air is muggiest. Bamboo also has no problem finding footing in hot spots and can be strategically planted to serve as an attractive and exotic privacy hedge. Just be careful to make sure it doesn't spread out of control."

          "headline":"Take the precipitation levels in your area into account.",
          "description":"The amount of rainfall your plants take in can play a big part in how well they ultimately do. Gardens that see regular showers usually won't be in need of much extra watering. On the other hand, your plants may benefit from 2-3 good drinks a day if they spend a lot of time drying out under the hot sun. All it takes is one good storm to drown out species like cotyledon and verbena, which don't like to get wet. Run a quick search for the annual rainfall averages in your neck of the woods to get an idea of how frequently you'll need to water your plants."

          "description":"Plug your postal code into an online frost date calculator to find out when the first and last frosts of the season are due where you live. With few exceptions, young plants respond poorly to plunging temperatures. Knowing when they're coming will allow you to plant new additions accordingly and take measures to protect the selections that are already below ground. The National Centers for Environmental Information makes many excellent resources available to curious regional gardeners."

          "description":"The overall size of your garden will be one of the biggest limiting factors in what you're able to grow there. For instance, you may only need a few square feet to put in a small annual flower bed. Raising a large garden filled with fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, will require much more ground space. Consider converting one corner of your backyard into a growing site. That way, everything will be together in one place, which will make watering and pruning less of a chore. Don't let a lack of square footage discourage you. It's possible to keep a thriving garden almost anywhere, as long as you're willing to get creative."

In roomier landscapes, however, they'll fill in empty areas quite nicely and be free to spread out to their full size. Mid-sized trees, such as redbuds, magnolias, and Japanese maples, can be just the right size for establishing boundaries or providing natural privacy."

Picking up a few containers of the appropriate size can spare you the headache of reorganizing your beds in an effort to make everything fit. You can even move your containers indoors if the weather gets inhospitable. Make sure your containers are large enough to house the root structure of the species you're planting and have holes in the bottom for efficient drainage. Have fun coming up with clever container ideas. You might use an old washtub to plant a patch of petunias, or you could start a miniature herb garden in a wheelbarrow full of potting soil."

Keep in mind that it is possible to modify the soil conditions in your garden to a degree through the use of amendments and drainage materials. Golden aster, sweet fern, and most succulents are examples of plants that thrive in dry soil. Siberian iris, forget-me-nots, and hydrangea are thirstier than most plants, and as a result are better equipped to handle marshy soil types."

Since plants can have such radically different light requirements, they might not all be equally suitable for your space. The light requirements for a given plant can typically be found on the pot or package."

The same goes for tomatoes, lemons, and other fruits and veggies that naturally spring up where there's ample light and heat. Save the center of your garden for species that require higher doses of sunlight. Move your container plants around as needed throughout the day to increase the amount of time they spend in the sun."

There, they'll be able to take in enough light to grow, but not enough to rob them of precious moisture. If your garden is partially shaded by trees or other structures, it could be the perfect place to plant impatiens or columbines, which are most comfortable with light that's somewhere in-between. Keep the soil around exposed shade plants damp to cool them off and prevent them from drying out."

Most annuals have the same basic needs and are relatively low-maintenance, which can make it easier to grow an assortment of different species together in the same space. Begonias, snapdragon, and marigold can all get by with minimal tending, making them a great choice for first-time growers and those who have limited time to spend in the garden. Mix-and-match your annuals to lay down stretches of eye-catching color. Many of the more festive varieties come in multiple shades, including reds, pinks, yellows, purples, and blues, so your options are nearly endless."

They owe their longevity to more flexible water and nutrient requirements. Once plants like heuchera, grandiflorum, and Peruvian lily are in the ground, they're not very demanding. For many people, the fun of gardening lies in combining annual and perennial plants to create dazzling displays of shape, color, and texture."

They're most often characterized by features like colorful blooms, unusual textures, and lush, cascading foliage, and may also bear fruit or have a pleasant aroma. One or two out-of-the-ordinary offerings could spice up an otherwise plain garden in a big way. Bring in a weeping willow or cluster of chrysanthemums to add a touch of natural elegance to your garden. Grasses and groundcover plants are useful for filling in negative space and offsetting more common flowers and shrubs."

Be sure to follow the instructions provided on the package closely to ensure that your plants are successful.

Temperamental species like roses, boronia, and most small trees fall under this category. Hardening off potted plants can help them gradually acclimate to their new growing conditions. You can accomplish this by leaving them outside for an additional hour every day for 1-2 weeks, making your waterings more frequent in the meantime."

Once they take root, dig them up and replant them alongside their parent plants. With careful attention, they'll begin to flourish on their own. Keep newly-planted cuttings covered with clear plastic bags to increase the humidity around them and help them grow faster.
