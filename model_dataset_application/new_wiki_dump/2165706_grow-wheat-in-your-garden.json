Watch your garden off and on throughout the day to find the best area for full sun. If you don't have a full-sun location, just pick the sunniest spot you can."

          "headline":"Carve out a large area of your garden for growing wheat.",
          "description":"Wheat has a relatively low yield in relation to the space it takes up in your garden. You need about 90 square yards (75 m) to produce about 50 pounds (23 kg) of wheat, the amount of wheat an average person consumes in a year. Put in other terms, you need an area that's at least 16.5 feet (5.0 m) by 16.5 feet (5.0 m) to produce enough wheat for 1 person for a year. However, you could always plant less than that and just replace some of the wheat you buy each year. Keep in mind that in colder areas, you'll likely have a lower yield, as little as 60 pounds (27 kg) per 1,100 square feet (100 m). You shouldn't expect high yields with your first crop. Growing wheat, like growing any vegetable, involves a learning curve."

          "description":"Purchase a pH testing kit from a local gardening store or online. Follow the instructions on the back of your kit to determine the pH level of your soil. You can also send samples to a lab to test your soil, either from your local agriculture extension office at a university or from another soil-testing lab. Wheat doesn't like low pH levels, so if yours are below 7, amend the soil. Add about 2.5 pounds (1.1 kg) of limestone per 100 square feet (9.3 m) of soil for each half a level you need to increase the pH."

          "description":"Turning or digging the soil helps loosen it up, improving airflow and helping the plant grow. The simplest method to turn the soil is to take a spadeful from the ground, and flip it over in the same spot. Go across the whole bed this way. Only dig 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) down into the soil. You can also dig trenches, and flip the soil from one trench into the previous trench. If your plot is large, you can use a rototiller to turn your soil more easily."

Some winter wheat varieties will survive down to \u221210 \u00b0F (\u221223 \u00b0C). Plant winter wheat seeds about 6 weeks before the first expected frost. While winter wheat does well in cooler climates, you do need to sow it when it's a bit warmer. Doing so will help the wheat germinate more readily."

          "description":"Because winter wheat won't survive where it's very cold, opt for spring wheat in those areas. In the United States, only the very northern states in the Midwest and East Coast fall into zone 3, such as most of Montana, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Minnesota and parts of Michigan, New York, Vermont, and Maine, so those are the areas you should plant spring wheat instead. Plant spring wheat after the last frost in your area. Check weather sites for when the first and last frosts typically happen in your area."

Aim for about 1 seed per 1 square inch (6.5 cm). You won't be able to get this exactly precise, and that's fine. If you're not confident you can spread the seed uniformly, try a broadcast seed spreader, which you can find in the lawn section at your local home improvement or gardening store. Adjust the hole size at the bottom for wheat, and then roll it over the garden area. It will disburse the seed evenly for you."
