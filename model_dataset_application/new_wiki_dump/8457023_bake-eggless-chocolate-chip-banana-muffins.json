Doing this helps the muffins to rise. Measure and combine your dry ingredients (the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt) in a large bowl.  Peel and mash your banana in a bowl (large enough to hold 2 cups).  Add to the mashed banana your milk and oil/butter. Stir it together. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients.  Stir in your wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Make sure to stir well and get all the dry ingredients mixed in. Add in the chocolate chips. Stir in the chocolate chips so they are throughout the whole mixture.
