(Described in Item number 4.) A small First Aid kit\nA small tool kit, a jack that works and a spare tire in usable condition, and jumper cables. If you become stranded in your car, FIRST test your cell phone. If it has reception, call an emergency number first, then call the persons that are aware of your route and your travel time schedule. Test the cell phone periodically. Do not try to walk over for help. Exit the car ONLY to recover items from the trunk. Put the car cover on the vehicle with the bright, reflective X side out. Position the X on the roof the best you can. The car cover will help retain heat inside the car and repel the cold, wind, and drafts. If you are in a severe situation, the reflective X can by seen by aircraft that may be conducting a search for you. Your license plate numbers will be visible to a search and rescue team working on the ground.",
