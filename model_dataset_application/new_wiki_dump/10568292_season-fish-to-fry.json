If you're cooking for kids and they find the strips too large to eat, cut the catfish filets into 2 in (5.1 cm) bite-sized chunks."

Stir the seasoning ingredients together with a fork until they're fully blended together. Avoid mixing the seasonings together with your hands. Cayenne pepper is spicy and will irritate your eyes should you rub them after mixing the seasonings."

Pour the suggested amount of buttermilk into the bowl. If you don't have a wide, flat bowl, a 9 in \u00d7 9 in (23 cm \u00d7 23 cm) cooking tray would work as a substitute."

It's fine if catfish strips stack on top of one another, as long as each strip is fully dunked in buttermilk at some point. The buttermilk coating will help the cornmeal mixture stick to the surfaces of the catfish strips."

Turn the strips over 2-3 times to coat both sides in the mix. If you like heavily-seasoned fish to fry, drag the fish strips back and forth through the cornmeal mixture. This will ensure that each strip is coated in savory spices."
