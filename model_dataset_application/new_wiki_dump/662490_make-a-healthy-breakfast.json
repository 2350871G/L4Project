          "description":"Believe it or not, you can actually make really good scrambled eggs in the microwave. Beat together 2 eggs in a microwave-safe container. Add 1 handful of your favorite chopped veggies. Cherry tomatoes and sauteed spinach leaves work well, or you can use whatever veggies you have leftover from dinner the night before. Sprinkle in a bit of cheese. One ounce of reduced-fat cheese is packed with protein and is a great addition to any healthy breakfast. Don't overdo it, though, as cheese can still be a caloric food. Keep your serving size to once ounce and stick to reduced-fat or skim cheeses. Zap the mixture in the microwave for about 30 seconds, stir, and then cook for another 30 seconds or until the eggs are solid."

          "headline":"Make a health egg sandwich.",
          "description":"Sandwiches are often thought to be off limit because they can be a bit heavy on the carbs. However, there are healthy ways to put together a satisfying breakfast sandwich. Watch your fillings. To keep you sandwich healthy, plan on filling it with low-cal items like egg whites ( to cut out some fat and cholesterol from the yolk), light cheeses, and veggies. Avoid caloric spreads like full-fat mayonnaise. Cut the carbs in half by making an opened-faced sandwich with just one slice of bread instead of two. Top a lightly toasted slice of whole wheat bread with some smashed avocado and then top it all with a sunny-side up egg (or cooked however you prefer). Avocados are rich in \"good\" fats, oils, and tons of vitamins."
        },

          "headline":"Wrap it up to go as a breakfast burrito.",
          "description":"Burritos are great on-the-go breakfasts; simply warm up your fillings, roll in a tortilla, and hit the road with breakfast in hand. Eggs work great in a breakfast burrito, which can be made using whole wheat and/or low-carb tortillas. You can basically throw whatever you have on hand in there -- cooked beans, veggies, low-fat cheese, even leftover whole grain rice -- it\u2019s a great refrigerator clean-out vehicle. Some things to avoid, though, that will take your burrito into unhealthy territory are refried beans, full-fat sour cream, full-fat cheeses, and other processed foods. Boost your protein count by adding some lean meat to your breakfast burrito. Soy-based vegetarian meats have tons of protein, as do traditional meat items like Canadian bacon, lean ham, turkey bacon, and smoked salmon."

          "description":"Fruits contain lots of fiber, which when combined with protein rich low-fat Greek yogurt is a recipe for breakfast success. Basic smoothie recipes combine about 1 cup of plain low-fat Greek yogurt, 1 cup frozen fruit (banana and berries work best), and 1/2 cup liquid (low-fat or soy milk is great for even more protein, but juice or coconut water also work well). Get creative by throwing in some chia, hemp, or flax seeds. These power-foods are packed with tons of protein, fiber, and nutrients. You can make your smoothie the night before, freeze it overnight, and thaw/re-blend it in the morning."

          "description":"If you like a bit more crunch for breakfast than typically found in a smoothie, try putting together a fruit and yogurt parfait. Layer together low-fat yogurt with some healthful toppings: crushed nuts, rolled oats, and fresh cut fruits for sweetness. Packaged granola can be laden with added sugars and oils, so it's best to avoid them. Instead, opt for making your own healthy granola. Be on trend by combining some chai seeds to your yogurt parfait, or topping it with oatmeal, fruit, and/or peanut butter to make your own version of an \"acai bowl.\" Peanut or another type of sun butter can also be a nice addition to yogurt parfaits. Swirl in some natural or low-sugar peanut butter for a nice textural and protein-rich addition."

Actually, multigrain carbs can be a rich source of fiber and are important energy sources for the start of your day. Instead of going for frozen, pre-packaged waffles which can be loaded with unnecessary sugars and oils, make an extra batch of part whole-grain waffles and freeze them in individual plastic bags. You can pop your homemade frozen waffles into the microwave or toaster/toaster oven just like the store-bought ones.

Use plain rolled oats, steel-cut oats, or a mix of barely, rye, and other grains. Cook your oats until tender in a little water or milk. Water has less calories, but milk has more body and flavor. You can cook your oats on the stovetop or microwave. Ditch the sugary instant oatmeal packs; it\u2019s super easy to just make your own. Portion out your oats and toppings of choice, and seal them up in plastic bags. Keep them in the refrigerator until your ready to heat and eat in the morning. Oats are naturally gluten free, but can sometimes become tainted when processed in facilities with gluten. If you have an allergy,be sure to check the labels and make sure your oats are certified gluten-free."
