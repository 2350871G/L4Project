  "text":" Gather Your Supplies Purchase high quality cotton string to act as your bracelet base. Your craft store will offer a wide variety of colors so choose your favorite. Select metal or porcelain beads to populate your bracelet. Purchase several dozen beads for your bracelet; this amount lets you have extra beads on hand. Pick up a few buttons to be used on the end of your bracelet. You will be looping one end of the bracelet and then hooking the button into the loop to secure it in place. Find a button that matches not only the beads but also the string. Cut and Braid the String Cut two pieces of string that are at least four inches (10cm) long. Keep each piece of string the same length, as you will be joining them together. Fold the string in half, holding the string toward the end. You will be creating a loop with the string, so make sure you have enough room on the end. Hold the end of the string and create a loop on one end by double knotting the string around itself. Cut off any excess string after you've created the loop. This removes excess string hanging outside of the bracelet. Braid the bracelet, beginning by the knot that was tied underneath the loop. Braid the bracelet approximately \u00bd inch (1.5cm). Add Beads to the Bracelet Thread the first bead onto the first string. Loop over for the first step of the braid. Add the next bead and loop the string over itself. Continue adding beads and then make the next step for braiding. Finish adding beads until approximately half of the bracelet is left. You will be braiding the remaining portion of the bracelet. Tie a small knot after the last bead to hold it in place. Make sure the knot is larger than the bead so it doesn't slide forward. Finish the Bracelet Braid the remaining portion of the bracelet and tie a knot toward the end. You will still need remaining string to add the button at the end. Thread the button onto the end of the bracelet and tie in place. You may want to thread the string through a needle in order to secure the button in place. Tie a strong knot in the end of the button to ensure it stays in place. Consider threading the string through the button and then tying it in place underneath the button. Finished. ",
