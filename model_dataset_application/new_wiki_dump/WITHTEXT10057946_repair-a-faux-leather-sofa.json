          "headline":"Peel and sand away any loose sections of faux leather.",
          "description":"Faux leather tends to peel, sort of like paint. If that happens, peel away most of the loose \u201cleather\u201d on top of the fabric backing. Next, use a fine-grit sanding sponge to smooth down any rough edges and bubbles. Don't get too carried away here! You only need to peel away the coating that's within the damaged area."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Apply a coat of interior latex house paint, then let the paint dry.",
          "description":"For the smoothest finish, pour the paint into a tray, then apply it with a mini foam paint roller. Wait for the paint to dry completely before moving on. This could take a few hours, depending on the type of paint that you are using. Bring 1 of the sofa cushions to the store so that they can color-match the paint for you. You can use \"fabric and vinyl\" spray paint as well. Apply 1 coat of gesso first, let it dry for 1 day, then apply the spray paint."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Lightly sand the paint, then wipe away any dust.",
          "description":"Get a piece of fine-grit sandpaper or a fine-grit sanding sponge. Use it to lightly sand the paint until the surface feels smooth, then wipe the dust away with a soft cloth. This step will reveal some of the backing material under the paint. This is fine, and all part of achieving a smooth finish."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Repeat the painting and sanding process up to 4 more times.",
          "description":"Each time you apply a coat of latex paint, you fill in the grain on the exposed backing. When you sand the paint, you smooth down any raised bumps. How many times you end up doing this really depends on how bad the damage is. Keep painting, drying, and sanding the surface until it looks smooth."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Buff the painted surface with a paste wax until it feels smooth.",
          "description":"This is important as it acts as a sealant for the paint and prevents it from getting sticky. Simply rub the paste wax on, then wipe it off with a soft cloth. Keep buffing the surface until it feels smooth and the wax is absorbed into it. Paste wax can take up to 20 minutes to dry. Fortunately, you can do a few things to help it dry faster, as described in the next step."

        {
          "headline":"Dust baby powder or talcum powder over the wax.",
          "description":"This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help the wax set and dry faster. Use a powder brush to apply the powder, wait a few minutes for the powder to absorb into the wax, then dust the rest off."

These kits usually come with basic colors, such as black, white, red, yellow, and blue. The kit described in this method requires heat setting."

          "description":"Some kits include a color mixing chart, which you can use as a reference. You may still have to lighten or darken the color to get the exact shade you need. Most kits usually include a few empty pots for mixing and storing new colors. You can use these pots, or you can use a little dish instead."

        {
          "headline":"Brush the paint onto the affected area, overlapping the edges.",
          "description":"Use the brush included with the kit to apply the paint over the exposed surface. Be sure to extend the paint by a few millimeters onto the edge of the faux leather as well; this will help seal it in better. If your kit did not come with a brush, use a stiff bristled brush; don\u2019t use a soft, camelhair brush. This paint is heat-set, so it won\u2019t dry until you apply heat to it."

          "description":"Most kits will include some sort of textured paper that mimic the texture of leather and pleather. If you want to make the repair more seamless, you can use this paper. Skip this step if your kit did not include this paper."

If you don't have an iron, you can heat the tool up against a lit burner on your stove, or even a candle flame. If you lost the heat tool, you can try using a regular clothing iron on instead. Use a cotton, no-steam setting."

        {
          "headline":"Press the heat tool against the paper for 2 minutes.",
          "description":"Move the tool around so that you distribute the heat evenly, then peel the paper away. If the texture is not up to your liking, apply the paper and heat tool again. Keep the tool hot. Re-heat it a few times against the iron, especially if you can feel it cooling town. If you are using a regular iron, press the paper with just the tip; avoid touching the rest of the sofa. If this softens the faux leather too much, lower the heat."

Be sure to round the corners of the rectangle or square to help prevent buckling. This will go behind the tear and \u201cleather,\u201d so the color of the fabric does not matter. You can use an actual denim repair patch, or you can cut a patch from an old pair of jeans. If you don\u2019t have any denim on hand, another sturdy fabric, like canvas, may work."

          "description":"Avoid using your fingers for this, as they can cause the faux leather to warp. Simply use the tweezers to push and slide the denim unto the tear. Run your fingers across the faux leather to either side of the tear. If you feel any bumps, smooth them out with the tweezers from the inside. Don't remove the sofa cover. Insert the patch through the slit into the sofa, then smooth it out."

Move the toothpick around so that it coats the back of the faux leather, then repeat the process for the other side of the tear. A flexible super glue made for fabric and vinyl will work fine for this; do not use regular super glue, however, as it dries too hard. You can also use fabric glue."

Next, using your fingers, press the edges of the tear together so that they are flush. Work quickly so that the glue does not dry. You want to get everything into position before the glue sets. Depending on the brand of glue that you are using, you\u2019ll have about 10 to 15 minutes to work with."

Center the board over the tear, then lean against it. Check the directions on the bottle to find out how long the glue needs to dry.

Apply the paint over the tear with a sponge brush, then dry it with a hair dryer. Again, this step is for aesthetic purposes. If you just want to patch up the tear, then you don\u2019t need to do this. If you texturized the tear with super glue, then you should apply the paint to help blend it in.

If you see some bumps and ridges, sand the surface down with 220- to 325-grit sandpaper, then apply more super glue. Pat the glue with a paper towel, apply more paint, then heat-set the paint with a hairdryer. Be careful with bonded leather, which is just a thin layer of paint on a fabric-like backing.
