Some seasonal themed decoration ideas you could try are:\nFor a summer theme hang yellow and blue streamers around the room. Add a sun shaped pinata to the ceiling filled with candy. Blow up inflatable palm trees and beach balls and leave them in the corners of the room. Serve the drinks in coconuts and offer a tropical lei on arrival. For a winter wonderland theme hang snowflakes and tinsel from the ceiling. Sprinkle fake snow fluff or silver confetti around the room and drape blue or white LED string lights to make the room glow. For a spring theme gather flowers and fill the room with colour. Add some green leaves, branches, toy birds and bees on top of the tables. For an autumn theme use red and orange crepe paper streamers and sprinkle autumn leaves around the room. Serve harvest style food including apple pie, pumpkin pie and carrot cake."
