Creating a Diagram Take a picture of your door and print it out. When you go in to select a replacement door, you should bring along a diagram with all relevant characteristics and measurements. One easy way to do this is to photograph your door and print out the image. You can also simply draw a diagram with paper and pen. Label the swing direction of your door. Open your door.

Your door will also either be in-swing or out-swing. Determine both of these characteristics and record them on the diagram you made. An in-swing door opens into your house (or into a room), and an out-swing door opens outward. Record all of the measurements on your diagram. Write the height, width, and thickness of your door down on your diagram. Write down the the height, width, and thickness of the door frame, as well. Bring this diagram with you when you shop for doors. This diagram should make the process of replacing your door a lot simpler.
