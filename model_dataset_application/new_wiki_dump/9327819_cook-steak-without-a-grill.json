      "description":"To begin prepping your steak, you first want to wash your hands. Lay the steaks on a cutting board or any type of surface that can be easily disinfected. Measure out the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. As you measure out each seasoning, place it into a dish. Stir them with a fork to make sure that they are evenly mixed. Use your fingers to grasp a dash of the mixture and sprinkle enough of the seasoning on the top of the steak so that it is adequately covered. Turn the steak over and repeat this with the other side."
