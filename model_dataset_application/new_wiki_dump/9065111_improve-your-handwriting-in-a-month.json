          "description":"In order to improve your handwriting, you need to evaluate your starting point. Take out your pen and notebook and write a paragraph (at least 4-6 lines of text) about anything you want. Then spend some time carefully evaluating each aspect of your lettering. What are your strengths and weaknesses? Try to notice:\nThe shapes of your letters\nThe slant of your words (and whether or not it is consistent)\nThe spaces between letters and words\nThe size of your letters\nThe alignment of your writing (moving upward or downward; overlapping with other words)"

Choose one or two elements of your handwriting that you\u2019d really like to change, and focus on these as you practice.

Schedule your handwriting practice each day, and do not allow other obligations to get in the way. It can be helpful to do this at the same time each day, so that you form a habit.

Carefully complete three worksheets every day, following the instructions provided. Remember to focus on the one or two areas you specifically want to improve. This should take 15\u201320 minutes.

As you do this, slowly refine each letter, creating the look you desire. Keep in mind the slant of your letters (aiming to be consistent), and the spacing between them.

Practice writing your letters until writing them clearly and consistently becomes habit. Then, begin to write smaller and smaller, until you are writing in a normal sized font. It can help to start writing with a marker or crayon to refine your big, bold letters."
