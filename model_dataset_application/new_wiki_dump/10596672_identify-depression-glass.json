Other common colors of depression glassware are cobalt, custard, amethyst, jadeite, and delphite. Amethyst pieces of depression glass are violet, jadeite pieces are a light green, and delphite pieces are a light blue."

Due to the glassware being very thin, it is also susceptible to chipping. Check the piece for chips at the edges, as this is also indicative that it is not a reproduction piece."

Use either a reference book or website to guide you through the defining characteristics of each type, so that you can determine the pattern and the maker of your depression glassware. The Collector's Encyclopedia of Depression Glass by Gene and Cathy Florence is a great reference book to guide you through depression glass identification. A reference website such as https://www.kovels.com/price-guide/glass-price-guide/depression-glass.html is a good place to start to help you identify the pattern and price of the piece."

Look at the piece under a bright light and from all angles to see all of the small details. This will also help you to determine if the glassware is authentic. American Sweetheart is a very popular depression glass pattern. The glassware is soft pink or white-blue, and it is one of the most delicate patterns available. The American Sweetheart pattern is commonly found in depression glassware bowls, and the center is often decorated with intricate paisleys and curlicue designs. The Cameo pattern is another popular depression glass pattern. Most Cameo glassware is green, however, there are a very limited number of pink and yellow pieces available. Many cocktail and luncheon sets of depression glassware have the Cameo pattern, which looks like strings of beads stretching around each piece."

Depression glass was designed to be used every day during its time, so finding many scratches on the glassware is a good indication that it\u2019s a real piece. Real depression glass is very thin and delicate, which means that it is prone to being scratched."
