Bacteria grows on counters when they are not kept clean, which can make you sick if you prepare meals on them. Put things back where they belong. If you have bags of chips by the microwave, put the bag of chips in the pantry. If you have spices laying around your counters, put them up in the shelf along with the sugars and starches. Wipe off the counters and sweep the floors to clean up any crumbs. You don't want bugs crawling around. Wash the dishes. Dishes piled in the sink instantly makes the room look messy and it's also unsanitary. Take out the trash and recycling.

You'll thank yourself later when you're searching for your items, since you won't need to open every single box to see what it contains. Place items that you'll rarely use in storage spaces such as the attic or basement. Put more frequently used items under the bed or in the closet. Label the boxes that are going to be stored away in closets or under the bed so that you don't have to open the boxes when you're searching for your items. Maintaining a Clean and Tidy Home Set a cleaning routine. Left to your own devices your home might be messy again in no time. So, set a cleaning schedule to help keep you on track. The schedule will also help you create a new habit of cleaning and tidying more frequently. Choose days for vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom and taking out the trash. Make a mental note of how many dishes you should allow to pile up in the sink before you wash them. Or, don't let them pile up at all. Wash them after every meal. Put everything back where it belongs. Since you've taken the time to find everything a home, establish a routine of putting items back where they belong. Making a habit of putting items back when you're done with them means you'll be less likely to allow items to pile up. Your home will stay cleaner longer. If you live with people and you have moved some items around, make sure you tell them where everything belongs, so they can put them back too. Assign chores. If you live with other people, give everyone weekly or nightly chores. When maintaining the house is everyone's responsibility, the house is easier to keep clean and tidy. More people cleaning consistently equates to a cleaner home. There's power in numbers. Task someone with doing the dishes every night or take turns. Decide who is going to vacuum each week and clean the bathrooms. If you live alone, then you get the lucky task of doing everything alone. Tidy up every night. Before you go to bed, do a quick clean-up. Put dirty dishes in the sink. Pick up anything laying on the floor. Make it look nice enough so that when you wake up in the morning, the look of your home is a benefit, not a stressor. Hire a cleaning service. If you're really busy, hire a maid to come weekly or monthly to help you out. With busy schedules, everyone doesn't have the time to clean all the time, and there's nothing wrong with employing help. Simply do your research to ensure you find the right person to clean your home.",
