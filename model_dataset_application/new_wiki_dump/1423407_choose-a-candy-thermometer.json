An ideal thermometer will:\nHave a metal body\nHave a mercury bulb that sits low enough to read the temperature but doesn't touch the cooking container base\nHave clear markings and be easy to read\nAn adjustable clip or hook that allows it to be attached to the side of cooking pan or container."

      "description":"Accurate readings are an important part of making candy. The most accurate type of candy thermometer is the kind which holds the bulb away from the base of the cooking container. The thermometer should read in the range of 100\u00baF to 400\u00baF / 38\u00baC to  204\u00baC. If the thermometer is out by even just a few degrees, it can ruin a sugar syrup or candy mixture."

      "description":"You can test the thermometer as follows:\nPlace it into a saucepan of cold water. Bring the water to the boil. Check the reading. It should be displaying 212\u00baF/100\u00baC. If the reading is not showing this, you will need to make adjustments accordingly when using the thermometer (add or subtract the number of degrees by which the thermometer is out). If the thermometer comes home from the store already misreading, return it for another one, explaining that you tested it in this manner."
