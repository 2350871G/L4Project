  "text":" Creating Light Sources Burn crayons as candles. Most crayons make fairly good candles, if you leave the paper wrapping on as a wick. A typical crayon burns for about half an hour. It may help to break the tip off the candle before lighting it. Make a candle from petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly (Vaseline) burns easily and for a long time. The most efficient way to use it is to rub it onto cotton balls or other flammable materials, placing them on aluminum foil or another fireproof material. For a long-term light source, light a candle or homemade wick stuck in a small container of petroleum jelly. Create an oil lamp. Pour vegetable oil into a container.

This won't burn for long, so it's mainly useful to light other items if you're out of matches. The wool and bowl reach very high temperatures. Take care not to burn your fingers, and do not touch the bowl for at least ten minutes. Starting a Fire Work in a fireproof, ventilated area. If you don't have a fireplace or wood stove, build your fire in a metal campfire bowl, or clear an outdoor area of all flammable materials. Always build a fire in a well-ventilated area, to avoid the risk of lethal carbon monoxide buildup. Lay down tinder. Begin with an easy-catching, quick-burning material such as balls of paper, cotton wool, or dried leaves. Add longer-burning material. Use longer-burning materials for the next layer of tinder, such as strips of cardboard or bark. These will catch easily but provide more heat than your first layer. Build up the fire. Add increasingly large sticks or other flammable items, spacing them out to get oxygen to the fire. Finish with a log or two if available. Light the tinder. If you do not have a source of flame, learn about other ways to start your fire. You may need to light the tinder several times in order to get the larger materials to light. Preparing for a Power Cut Get a hand-cranked flashlight. Any flashlight will come in handy, but a hand-cranked one will never run out of power. Many of them also include a radio for emergency situations. Buy a camping lantern. If you plan to light the lantern indoors, check the safety information to make sure you have adequate ventilation. Propane and white gas lanterns are particularly dangerous indoors, due to high levels of carbon monoxide. Lanterns powered by kerosene, vegetable oil, and especially alcohol are generally safer, but still require ventilation. Light outdoor areas with solar lights. Illuminate outdoor walkways with solar-powered lights from a garden store. Consider purchasing a generator. If power cuts happen frequently in your location, be prepared with a generator powered by diesel or petrol. Although not the cheapest option, this can save you effort, and allow you to power appliances as well as lights.",
