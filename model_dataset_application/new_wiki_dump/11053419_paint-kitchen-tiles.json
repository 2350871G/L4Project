If you see any mould, you can remove it by applying a fungicidal spray. Scraping out and replacing any grout that is in poor condition before you start will give the best finish."

This will remove any glaze and help the new paint to adhere better. Once the surface is sanded, you'll need to wipe away any remaining dust or grit with a damp cloth. Leave the tiles to dry completely for 24 hours; after all the preparation work, you really want to make sure the paint will stick. Using an electric sander will make the job quick and easy if you have a large area."
