          "description":"The most basic and common way to eat muesli is just as you would eat a bowl of cereal, adding about a half cup of your favorite milk to an equal helping of muesli in a bowl. Instead of milk, try your favorite brand of plain yoghurt (or flavoured if your prefer extra sweetness) for probiotic benefits and a different flavor and texture. Try heating the milk, then letting the muesli soak for a few minutes in the hot milk to soften it slightly, making it a bit more like oatmeal. You can also pour cold milk over the cereal in a microwave safe bowl, then heat the whole mixture in the microwave. Like cereal, it's also great to snack on all by itself. Just snack on it like granola."

Any of the following work great with muesli:\nSliced banana\nBlueberries, blackberries, or raspberries\nKiwi\nStrawberries (the seeds work especially well as they add an extra sour crunch)\nPork Scratchings (ideal if you want a more savoury muesli)\nDiced apple\nChopped pear\nSliced mango\nLychees work especially well as they add a crisp sour flavour, which can't be topped\nPomegranate seeds"

Add equal parts of muesli and milk to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, or a lid, and refrigerate overnight. This can turn the muesli into a cold porridge type mixture that many people really enjoy. Coconut milk makes for a great soaking mixture, adding gentle sweetness and subtle flavor to the muesli. If you're not crazy about the taste, you could also mix it in with a little milk to make it more palatable."

It mixes in quite nicely and helps to add texture and nutrition to any smoothie recipe.

The raw oats offer a different texture and nutritional benefits not offered by cooked oatmeal or granola, but also offer the possibility of cooking into a simple porridge, just like basic raw oats. Boil as much milk and water as you want to yield in cooked muesli, then add half as much muesli to the pot. If you want a cup of cooked muesli, in other words, boil a half cup of water and a half cup of milk, then add a half cup of raw muesli to it. Lower the temperature and cook the muesli covered for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it reaches the desired consistency. Eat it any time it looks good."
