The level that triggers an evolution varies from Pok\u00e9mon to Pok\u00e9mon. If you're unsure when or how a Pok\u00e9mon will evolve, this information is easy to find online. You can check the Pok\u00e9mon's page on a Pok\u00e9mon resource site like Bulbapedia, for instance. Note that select Pok\u00e9mon will only evolve by using special items or by meeting special conditions. For example, Most Eevee evolutions require an evolutionary stone to evolve (Flareon, Vaporeon, Leafeon, Jolteon) while Espeon requires a certain level of friendship to be reached between 6 am-6 pm, and Umbreon requires friendship to be reached from 6 pm-6 am. Sylveon requires a soothe bell to be held while it reaches the correct level of friendship, and you must be in the appropriate location for Eevee to evolve into Glaceon."

The screen may flash and the Pok\u00e9mon may \"blink\" between its current form and its next evolution.
