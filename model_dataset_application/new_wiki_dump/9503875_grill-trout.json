          "description":"Using a filet knife, make a straight cut on the bottom of the fish from the anal fin to the pectoral fins, stopping right before the gills. On the underside of the mouth, cut down on each side of the chin to create a V shape. Using scissors, cut from each of the pectoral fins to the trout\u2019s adjacent gills. Grab the mouth cuts and pull back to remove the guts and gills. Though not required, you can remove the trout\u2019s head and skin if desired. To do so, use your scissors to cut off each of the fins. After, pull the head back slowly to remove the skin. Clip the tail, then quickly rinse the fish to wash off any blood."

Use a wide, flat spatula to flip the fish over. Cook until the other side is well-browned. The trout should pull off the grill easily, so if it doesn\u2019t, let it cook a bit longer. Grilling Foil Trout Gut and gill your trout. If you\u2019re cooking fresh-caught trout, use a filet knife to slice the bottom of the fish from the anal fin to the pectoral fins, making an incision that ends immediately before the gills. Underneath the mouth, create a V shape by making small slices along the chin. With scissors, make cuts between the fish\u2019s gills and nearby pectoral fins.

Trout can be cooked with the head and skin on, but you can remove them if desired by cutting off each of the fins and pulling the head back slowly. Make sure to  clean the skinned fish before cooking. Place your trout in a sheet of aluminum foil, skin-side down. Lay out a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place your fish filet in the center of the foil, leaving enough room on the sides to wrap it up later. Heat your grill to a high temperature. Electric and gas grills should be set to around 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C). If you\u2019re using a charcoal grill, build the flame on one side so you can place your fish on the opposite end. Lightly sprinkle your fish with salt, pepper, and olive oil. Sprinkle pinches of salt and pepper over your fish to taste. After, drizzle olive oil over your fish to keep in moisture and flavor while on the grill. Cover your fish with fresh herbs and citrus slices. Lay fresh dill, oregano, thyme, and parsley evenly over the trout. For added tang and taste, spread out thin slices of lemon, lime, or other citrus fruits on the filet. Wrap the foil over your fish to make a small, sealed tent. When you\u2019re ready to grill, wrap the aluminum foil around your filet. Make sure it is completely sealed to pack in steam. To give the package room to breathe, pull up on the foil to create a small pocket of air above the fish, making a small tent. Put your foil package on the grill and close the lid. Place your fish away from the direct flames. To help steam your fish, close the grill\u2019s lid while cooking. Make sure the package is skin-side down with the tent pointed up. Cook your fish for about five minutes per .5 inches (1.3 cm) of thickness. In general, average-size trout filets take about ten minutes to cook. To see if your fish is done, use heat-resistant gloves to open the foil slightly. If the fish flakes easily when scraped with a fork and is opaque, it is ready to be served. Grilling Cedar Trout Take out your trout\u2019s gills and guts. To prepare fresh trout for grilling, take a filet knife and make an incision on the fish\u2019s undercarriage between the pectoral fins and anal fin, stopping before the gills. Flip the fish on its back and make two cuts on the bottom of the mouth, creating a V shape. Using a pair of scissors, cut from each of the fish\u2019s pectoral fins to the closest set of gills. Pull back on the trout\u2019s mouth to remove the guts and gills. Though it is optional, you may want to remove the head and skin before cooking. To do so, chop off the trout\u2019s fins and peel the head back slowly. Rinse the fish to wash off any blood. Soak your cedar plank in water for 2 hours. This will help your fish steam while grilling, letting it gain a naturally woody flavor from the plank. For extra taste dimensions, soak your wood in a cooking alcohol like wine or cider instead. Set your grill to a high heat. For electric and gas grills, set the temperature to about 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C). For charcoal grills, set your embers near the center so you can place the trout next to them. Oil your fish to keep in moisture. Spread a small amount of oil over your filet to pack in moisture while cooking. Combined with the cedar plank, this should keep your trout tender and juicy. Season your trout with salt, pepper, herbs, and citrus. Sprinkle a light amount of salt, pepper, dill, oregano, thyme, and parsley over the top of your trout. Depending on preference, either squeeze out a lemon or lime over your fish or place fresh citrus slices on top. Put your cedar plank on the grill and top it with the trout, skin-side down. Place your cedar plank to one side of the grill, off the direct flames. Place your trout on top to cook, making sure the skin-side is facing down and touching the plank. Grill until the fish is opaque and flakes easily. Cook your trout until it is opaque and flakes easily with a fork. For average-sized trout, this should take about 10 minutes.
