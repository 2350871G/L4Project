If your opponent is throwing balloons designed for water fights, known as water bombs, they will have a harder exterior and will be much easier to catch. If you're fighting with cheaper party balloons, you may want to avoid trying to catch them because they will break more easily. If you fail to catch it, hitting an incoming balloon with your hand can either deflect it away or pop it away from your body so your clothes won't get as wet."
