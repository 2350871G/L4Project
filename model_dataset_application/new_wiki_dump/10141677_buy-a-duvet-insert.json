Check the label to see if the fill is \u201c100%\u201d or \u201cpure\u201d down, or a blend that also contains feathers or synthetics. Down may be composed of whole down clusters, fibers, or plumules (small feathers). \u201cLoft\u201d may refer to the percentage of whole down clusters in the mix, and a higher loft makes the down more resilient and better at containing warmth. Goose down is more voluminous than duck down, and it is generally more expensive and considered to be finer and more luxurious."

          "description":"Natural down may be processed to reduce or remove allergens, but some allergy sufferers may need to choose a synthetic fill instead. Duvet inserts with down alternatives may be filled with natural fibers such as cotton or wool, or synthetics such as polyester. Synthetics are generally less expensive, and better for allergy sufferers, but they may not have quite the feel of natural down. If you\u2019re looking for a synthetic, squeeze the fiberfill between your thumb and forefinger: if it rubs together smoothly and feels slightly slick, it will be less likely to clump in the long run. In addition to being hypoallergenic, duvets with synthetic alternatives may be the right choice if you\u2019re maintaining a vegan household."

An insert with a higher fill power is lighter, fluffier, and less dense because of the larger clusters used, which provide better insulation than smaller clusters because they trap more air. Goose down generally has greater fill power than duck down."
