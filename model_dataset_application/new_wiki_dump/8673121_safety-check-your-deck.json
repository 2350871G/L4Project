          "description":"Look all across the deck for damaged boards, particularly in areas where water gathers. Take an ice pick or screwdriver and push the tip into the wood. If the wood feels soft, splinters, or is easily penetrated, it is rotting and needs to be replaced. Pay special attention to the gaps between decking boards as well as the deck joists underneath the deck boards. Often, debris buildup stuck between the gap in the boards will hold water, which causes the wood to rot below the top layer of the deck. The wood may look sound but in reality it's rotting in between the boards. Also, be aware of insect holes that reduce the integrity of the boards."

Check to see that the flashing goes at least four inches (10.16 cm) up the wall and the caulking attaching it is holding. Look for any signs of mud, debris, water, or rot breaching the flashing. If the flashing is breached, it needs to be replaced or else the deck will begin to rot."

The joists are the crossbeams on the weight-bearing posts and need to be examined the same way. You can use a mirror and flashlight to look under the deck. Be sure no dirt or debris are piled up against any wood material. Pay special attention to how water drains under the deck to be sure there is no pooling after it rains or after you wash the deck. Not only will damp ground under the deck promote rot, it is a heavy breeding ground for unwanted insects."
