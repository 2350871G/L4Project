          "description":"Make an appointment with a photographer well in advance. Visit the websites of several photographers or call them directly to ask about pricing, time frame, and availability. Don\u2019t plan anything immediately following your shoot, in case you and your photographer spend more time than expected. Be aware that different photography studios will have different rules about booking, including cancellation policies. Make sure to choose a appointment on a day and time you\u2019ll be able to keep! If you need your portrait to be ready by a certain date, schedule you shoot a few weeks before, to make sure there is time for your photos to be edited and finalized."

          "headline":"Get plenty of rest.",
          "description":"Get eight hours of sleep during each of the two nights preceding your shoot. It\u2019s most important to get plenty of sleep two nights before the shoot, though you should get to bed early the night before too. Otherwise, do whatever makes you feel happy and healthy. In particular, try to squeeze in a jog or another form of exercise on the days leading up to your shoot. Avoid drinking the night before your shoot. Alcohol can have a detrimental effect on your in skin tone, give you baggy eyes, and diminish the quality of your rest."

          "headline":"Get a haircut or tan a few days before the shoot.",
          "description":"Plan to get your hair trimmed about a week before the shoot. Don\u2019t plan to get a haircut the day before, as this may lead to evident tan lines along the edges of your hairline. Further, ensure your skin is in good shape for the shoot by taking care to prevent a sunburn in the days preceding your shoot. If you do want to tan before the shoot, do so at least a few days before. Avoid spray-tanning before a photo shoot. A hair cut might be worth the time even if you don\u2019t think you need one. Getting rid of split ends or touching up any grey areas can greatly improve the quality of your photos."

          "description":"You can get away with a bit of pattern on a tie or scarf, but you should wear mostly solid colors. Avoid large stripes or any especially loud patterns. Even if they look good in person, patterns will dominate your photo and distract attention away from your face. Avoid wearing anything with a visible brand or other decals. Avoid any especially bright or neon colors."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Compliment your skin tones.",
          "description":"Choose clothing colors based on your skin. Light brown skin and hair pairs best with shades of brown, orange, or soft yellow. Dark hair and skin match wonderfully with bright colors like strong blues, greens, or red. Especially light skin and light hair is often complimented by pastels, including blues, purples, and greens. Light-skinned people should minimize the red they\u2019re wearing. If you can\u2019t decide, think of the shirts you wear that get the most compliments. Frequent compliments may indicate a good color match between the shirt and your skin tone."

          "headline":"Wear a suit.",
          "description":"For men in particular, a suit is an integral component of a professional business portrait. Blue suits are usually better, especially when paired with a light blue shirt. White shirts and black suits, though they great in person, often appear less attractive in digital photos. You have a bit more freedom regarding the color and design of a tie. Red is said to convey power, while yellows are another popular set of colors for ties."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Wear a well-fitting blouse.",
          "description":"Ladies, pay particular attention to the fit of your shirt. You want to avoid anything too baggy or too loose. Opt for a fitted blouse or dress that compliments your figure. If you're going with a button-down shirt, make sure none of the buttons gape when the shirt is fully buttoned. A collared button down that fits well is the ideal choice for most women. Wear a tailored suit coat as well if you usually do so at your job."

        {
          "headline":"Accessorize minimally.",
          "description":"A few subtle accessories can liven up your portrait. However, it\u2019s best to keep accessories low-key. Definitely leave large hoop earrings at home the day of your shoot. Similarly, don\u2019t wear an oversized watch or ring if your hands may be in some of the shots. Opt for simple, elegant jewelry, if any."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Wear long sleeves.",
          "description":"Exposed arms may look great, but they will distract attention away from your face. This applies to both men and women, though it can make clothing selections a bit more challenging for women in particular. Regardless of gender, it\u2019s best to dress conservatively for business professional portraits. Button your shirt most of the way up, perhaps leaving only the top button open if you\u2019re not wearing a tie."

          "headline":"Bring your makeup.",

In fact, it\u2019s likely worth putting on a tiny bit more makeup than usual, as photography lighting often diminishes the effect of makeup. Either way, bring your makeup kit, just in case. Powder to help reduce shine on your face may prove especially helpful. If you have the time and money to get your makeup done professionally earlier in the day, consider this option. This is by no means necessary, of course. Rest assured that your photographer will edit out any blemishes or acne, so don\u2019t worry too much if you breakout just before your shoot. The best makeup for a shoot is slightly different than your everyday makeup. There are tutorials available on YouTube to help guide your makeup application."

They may also have specific recommendations about when to show up and how they may be able to help you prepare for the shoot. Be prepared to do some last minute touches.

The photos will turn out better if you\u2019re able to relax and flash some genuine smiles. Your photographer will likely help you relax by trying to chat with you. Listen to what they\u2019re saying and allow yourself to laugh \u2013 not matter how bad the jokes. If something in particular is making your nervous, let the photographer know about it. They will either address the issue to assure you that the photos will turn out great anyway! Remind your photographer has chosen a profession helping to make other people look good.
