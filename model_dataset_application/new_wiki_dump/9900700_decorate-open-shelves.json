          "description":"Having an overall theme brings an appealing consistency to your shelving. The theme doesn't have to be anything wildly imaginative. Items that have similar colors, shapes, textures, or functions will do. Items that look similar look like they belong together, so your shelves look organized as a result. For example, you can keep a collection of ceramic plates or similarly-colored books on your shelves. If you have a collection of items, like vases of various sizes, shapes, or colors, disperse them throughout the shelves to create a cohesive look."

          "headline":"Include some contrasting items to add variety.",
          "description":"You may not want an entire shelf to hold nothing but white porcelain. An unexpected object breaks up the repetition. If you place these items in clever locations, they will draw the viewer's eye along the shelf. For example, include a woven basket, metal kettle, or bright red cookbook among your white plates to add some much-needed variety. If you display a lot of books, put books with interesting covers or differently-colored spines on your shelves. If you have a lot of colorful items, you can add some neutrality by placing your books with the spines facing the back of the shelves so the pages are visible."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Store everyday items on your shelves.",
          "description":"A benefit of open shelving is accessibility. This makes it a useful place to keep that favorite mug you use for coffee every morning. Think of items you use frequently, then include them in your display so you can always reach them without having to dig through cupboards to find them. These items generally belong on lower shelves that you can reach without much effort. For example, put frequently-used CDs and DVDs on your shelves. You can also put items in decorative baskets or bowls to make the shelf look nicer and more organized."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use items that reflect your personality and interests.",
          "description":"Because the items themselves serve as decorations, open shelving gives you a unique opportunity to put yourself on display. Choose items that feel meaningful to you. Only put them on the shelves if you don't mind letting other people see them. For example, if you're a photographer, you may wish to leave your camera on a shelf. This way, it's both accessible and a meaningful decoration. Place your favorite books or video games on the shelves. Framed pictures also look great on open shelves and can be leaned up against the wall."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Hide clutter in baskets.",
          "description":"You may end up with a collection of items overcrowding your shelves. Consider replacing these items with a basket. Baskets are available in a variety of styles, so they are easy to incorporated into your decor. Then, use them to keep your shelves neat and organized. Baskets are also a good way to store items you don't want on display, such as cables from electronic devices. Use baskets to store extraneous objects like extra blankets or mail. Typically, baskets look best on lower shelves. If you use the items in the baskets frequently or if they're heavy, be sure to put them on the lowest shelf."

          "description":"Mentally break up each shelf into a couple of pieces. Each section is a small display that you should decorate individually. Doing this not only makes decorating feel less intimidating, but it can help your shelving look more cohesive when you're done. If you have a 5 ft (1.5 m) shelf, you can divide it up into 1 ft (30 cm) sections. Decorate each section individually. You don't have to measure out the sections. Make mental estimations about how to divide up the shelves. For example, you might decorate the first part of the shelf with a big pot, then contrast it in the next section with a potted plant. Just make sure the shelves are balanced and cohesive."

        {
          "headline":"Arrange frequently-used items on lower shelves.",
          "description":"Items you know you will need often, such as a specific bowl or personal object, belong on the lower shelves. This way, you don't have to dig through the decorations to get to them. Keep in mind which items need to be accessible as you organize them. The items you use less frequently can be stored on higher shelves that aren't as easy to access. Take shelf balance into account. Large items may look too noticeable up on the top shelf. Also, these items can be tough to remove safely from high shelves."

          "description":"Big items, like large vases, bowls, and baskets, are eye-catching. Start with these items, placing 1 on each shelf to avoid overcrowding. Keep them aligned in the center, as this will make the shelves look more balanced later. When someone views your shelves, these items are the first ones they will see. For example, a large TV works best when it is placed in the center of a shelf."
        },

          "headline":"Balance the shelf ends with similar objects.",
          "description":"The ends of the shelves are great places for other large objects or stacked objects, such as baskets or books. Keeping them away from the center items prevents the shelves from looking crowded. However, these items should be interspersed on different shelves to make the decor consistent. For example, you put one metal pot on the left end of a shelf. Put a second metal pot on the right end of the shelf underneath it to create consistency. You can also put bookends on either side of a shelf to create symmetry."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Layer your items to fit more on the shelves.",
          "description":"Most shelves are big enough to fit a few items close together. If yours are, set some decorative items against the wall between items you have already placed. This can fill some empty space on the shelves, adding more color and variety. Be careful with layering, because too much put on a shelf ends up being a lot of visual clutter. Be sure to put taller things in back, smaller in front. Otherwise, items will not be seen. You could also lay a few books down horizontally and stack another item, such as a picture frame or figurine, on top of the books for a sophisticated look.."

        {
          "headline":"Fill the remaining space with smaller items.",
          "description":"Once all of the larger decorations are in position, move on to the smaller items. These can be items like individual books, pictures, and figurines. Generally, they belong in the middle sections of the shelves, between the biggest items. You don't need to fill up all the space, though! Up to 50% of it can be bare for a nice visual effect. Stack small items to make them appear bigger. A pile of similarly-sized or colored books can occupy the end of a shelf."

          "headline":"Check your decorating after taking a break.",
          "description":"Decorating open shelves is trial and error. After you place all of the decorations, step away for a few minutes. Do a different activity or wait until the next day to critique your design work. You will quickly uncover ways to reorganize your shelves to make them look even better. You may need to do this a few times before the shelves look perfect to you. You could also ask a friend or family member for their advice."

Chances are a few colors appear in your room more often than others. Alter the rest of the room along with your shelf decorations to include these colors. A room theme works best when the colors you choose are interspersed throughout the room.

Select each item carefully so it matches with the overall aesthetic of the room. Modern shelving or decorations may look out of place in a room designed to appear rustic. If you have a modern room with sleek, dark furniture, you might want to use metal shelves. Then, decorate the shelves with metal picture frames, electronics, and colorful displays."

You can also use light colors such as a pale blue or wood paneling. Avoid dark, drab colors, since these contrast against most decorations."

Also, after the work you probably went through in arranging the shelves, you won't want to obscure the decor behind a large couch. Move furniture away so the shelves are visible. Placing a large chair near a shelf can be distracting. The size of the chair draws eyes to it, so your shelves will likely be underappreciated. If you want furniture near the shelves, restrict it to a single small chair if possible. Or, make sure the furniture is a solid or neutral color so the area doesn't look too busy."

Also, avoid placing large cabinets or additional shelving units nearby, since this can cause your space to look overcrowded. Distracting wall decorations can include bright wall paint, wallpaper, posters, and framed art. Intersperse other storage and shelving units throughout your home to create consistency."

Choose mostly items with neutral colors, such as white. Keep your room balanced by not drawing attention from nearby decorations. For example, a fancy framed painting may be on the wall. If you don't move it, it will be the first item anyone sees when they step into the room."

Refill your shelves with new items to keep your decor fresh. Adjust any wall decorations or nearby furniture as needed to keep the room fresh. Even rearranging the items on your shelving can make your decor look new again. You may want to change up your decor based on the season as well.
