James is a current Trustee Scholar at the University of Southern California. James Sears\t\t\tCleaning Guru\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Instead of simply having a cleaning closet, try keeping supplies in their respective areas. For instance, you might keep bathroom cleaning supplies in the bathroom or a nearby closet, instead of in a general closet mixed with other cleaning items. That way, your cleaning supplies will stay more organized, they'll be easier to find when you need them, and it's easier to track when you're running low on something."
