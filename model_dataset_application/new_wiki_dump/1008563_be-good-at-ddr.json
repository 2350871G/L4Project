Practice Mode can really help, adding things to songs in Dance Mode such as a Metronome (going \"tick, tick, tick\" to the 1/4-note beat), an Assist Tick (going \"tick\" every time a note passes by the judgment screen), and it can slow down songs, as well as you being able to choose any little part of the song to practice over and over and over and over again.
