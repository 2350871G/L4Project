      "headline":"Consider the burners and heat distribution.",
      "description":"Gas barbecues rely on a process of gas burners that are covered by warmth distributing materials which also act to burn off drippings to smoke the food. Cheaper designs use lava rocks or ceramic coals for this purpose, and do an ok job, although grease can accumulate and cause flash fires which we all know and hate from charcoal. When you really want the most effective look out for long bars or \u201cflavourisers\u201d that are designed to vaporize drippings quite rapidly to keep away from flares and create a smoky flavour (although you still won\u2019t match charcoal in many an opinion)! As for the number of gas burners, you get what you fork out for. Less costly one burner versions only enable the flame to be controlled over the entire cooking surface, and can have \u201ccold spots\u201d which may perhaps lead to uneven temperatures. Two/three burner types are genuinely worth it, offering you differing regions of temperature to cook different foods. Even so, if you're seriously feeling flush you may go for even much more burners (\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3! ), infrared heat sources (a bit over the top) and rotisserie back burners for that Michelin-starred experience. Try to keep away from side burners as these are high priced added touches and you\u2019ll most likely find you don\u2019t use them. You have variable warmth control on the primary grill anyway, and the side space is much better off reserved for your raw meat or a huge glass of beer!"

    {
      "headline":"Consider energy use.",
      "description":"As burner numbers and size increases, you may expect the quantity of gas you need to power the barbecue to increase. That being said, efficiency is also a consideration, so if you are in doubt search for the BTU (British Thermal Unit) score of the barbecue to see how much gas you will will need. Really don't get too worried about it though the only real time to worry is if a big design has a strangely low BTU rating when compared to comparable sized versions. Far from becoming extra efficient, a substantially lower rating can indicate poor energy output and you\u2019ll have a colder barbecue - this is rare though. The gas applied in most designs, called Propane, is really much less costly than charcoal, and a single canister can last for a number of cookouts."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Should you just want a straightforward gas barbecue that can do a very good job go for a one or two burner design.",
      "description":"Costs and features will vary, but search for a medium size with lava rocks or ceramic coals, and try your best to get a model with as even cooking as feasible. Side burners or storage parts will only push up the price so a quality primary burner is much much more crucial in this range. Also, really do not expect swanky looks, concentrate instead on durability."
    },
    {
      "headline":"If you want a mid range barbecue go for  three burners.",
      "description":"You\u2019ll need to look for stainless steel construction and a large grilling area, but still not be tempted by too many additional touches. In addition, at this selling price go for flavouriser bars instead or lava rocks or ceramic coals \u2013 you\u2019ll end up with a significantly better flavour."
    },
    {
      "headline":"When you move into the luxury barbecue market things start getting incredibly serious, and far more expensive.",
      "description":"Having said that, have a look around at the 4 burner types from Landmann, Electrolux and Beefeater when you really want some impressive kit. At this size anticipate sleek and solid metal with warranty, infrared rotisseries, enough space to cook for a mob and plenty of envy from your friends."
