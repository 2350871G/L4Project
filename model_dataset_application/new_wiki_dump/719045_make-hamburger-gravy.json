          "description":"Heat the pan on the stove over a burner set to medium-high. When a drop of water flicked into the pan starts sizzling immediately, it's hot enough. Crumble the beef into the pan and cook until pleasantly brown. Use your spoon or spatula to break up larger pieces. If you're using leaner ground beef (e.g., 95/5), you can add a small amount of oil to the pan to keep it from sticking. Fattier grades of ground beef (e.g., 80/20) will make enough grease on their own. See \"Tips\" below for help choosing fat or lean beef."

The gravy should gradually start to thicken as the heat evaporates the liquid. At this point, you can add as much of the remaining milk as you want. The more milk you add, the thinner the gravy will be. When it's at the consistency you want, heat it to boiling, stirring occasionally, then remove from the heat."

If you think the recipe could use a little extra flavor, feel free to add more of any of the seasonings. Go slowly, stopping to taste-test often. Remember: you can always add more, but you can't take any out."

For example, if you want to give your gravy a slightly more complex taste, try adding these dried herbs with the salt, pepper, etc. at the end of the recipe.

About one 14-ounce can of chicken or beef broth should be plenty."

However, since cornstarch can form unappetizing clumps if you add it directly to hot liquids, you need to prepare the recipe a little differently:\nWhile the beef cooks, combine the corn starch with the milk in a small bowl. You can also combine it with the broth if you're using it. Stir until well-combined. Add the liquid-cornstarch mixture gradually to the pan, stirring as you go."

The sour-savory taste of most steak sauces makes the perfect companion to the smooth taste of the basic gravy. Add your favorite steak sauce at the end of the recipe with the salt, pepper, etc. Barbecue sauce and hot sauce also work well here."

The latter will give it a nice pinkish color in addition to plenty of heat. Don't forget to add gradually and taste the gravy often to avoid adding too much!"

Since nonfat milk is slightly more watery, you may need to heat the gravy for slightly longer to get the same thickness (or add a little extra flour/cornstarch). You can also use leaner grades of ground beef to reduce the fat in the dish even more."
