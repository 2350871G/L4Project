The purpose of the design will determine the design. If you are advertising a company, band, sporting team, or brand, you will likely need to focus on logo. The Nike swoosh logo, for example, is a very simple but effective design. A design for a sporting team might feature the team colors or the team\u2019s mascot. A design for your band might focus on an image of the band or a graphic that represents the band\u2019s style or sound. If you are making a t-shirt to showcase a personal illustration or drawing, you will need to focus on how it will look on a t-shirt. Think about how original the illustration is and how the colors are working in the illustration. Consider using a photo in your design. Use your own photo. You may use a picture made by someone else, but only if you have acquired the legal rights to use that image. You can also buy a stock image."

This means how certain ink colors in the design will appear against a lighter colored shirt or a darker colored shirt. Certain ink colors look more vibrant on a lighter or darker shirt on the computer screen than they actually do when printed. When using lighter shirts, avoid pastel colors like yellow, light blue, or light pink. These colors will be visible on the shirts but may not be legible at a distance. And if you are designing a shirt with a logo, you want to make sure that logo is legible from far away! If you decide to use pastel colors, add an outline of a darker color to the lighter color to highlight the text and make it easier to read. Darker colored shirts look good with lighter ink colors, such as pastels. But be careful when using darker ink colors on darker colored shirts like cardinal (dark blue), maroon, or forest green. These colors may look great on the computer or in a drawing, but when they print, the shirt color sometimes distorts the ink color. As a result, they can appear more brown or dull. If you decide to use Adobe Illustrator to create your design, the Global Colours settings can help immensely with color schemes."

You can also access free brush designs from brusheezy.com. Look at how to add fonts to your PC, Illustrator, or Photoshop if necessary. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous with design, you can make your own. Create a prototype. The easiest way to do this is to print the design and iron it onto a plain shirt. However, if you want to test the quality of your design, you can hire a printing company to create a professional prototype. Produce the shirt(s). For a small-scale operation, you can continue ironing on the design. If you\u2019d like to make shirts at a larger scale, however, you can pay a printing company to make them for you. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f5\\/Design-Your-Own-T-Shirt-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Design-Your-Own-T-Shirt-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f5\\/Design-Your-Own-T-Shirt-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Design-Your-Own-T-Shirt-Step-11-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Screen-Printing Your Design Gather your supplies. To screen-print your design at home, you will need:\nA plain t-shirt\n50 ml bottle of degreaser (available at your local art store)\n1 liter cold water\nA large brush\n500 ml of emulsion\nA small bottle of sensitizer\nA bottle of screen printing ink\nA squeegee or a coating tray\nA small wooden stick\nA hair dryer\nA transparency\nA printing screen\nYou can purchase a printing screen at your local art store. Or make your own by buying a mesh screen and a canvas stretcher frame. Stretch the mesh across the frame and staple the edges down so that the mesh is taut. For standard designs on a light shirt, a 110-195 mesh works best. For fine designs with multiple colors, use a 156-230 mesh. Prepare the printing screen. Mix the degreaser and the cold water together. Place the brush in the mixture and then brush the mixture on to the screen. Make sure you brush both sides of the screen. You just want to give the screen a light brush so don\u2019t worry about putting too much of the mixture on the screen. Let the screen dry. Mix the emulsion and the sensitizer together. Take 20 ml of water and pour it into the bottle of sensitizer. Mix the sensitizer well by shaking for an about a minute. Add the sensitizer into the emulsion. Use the small wooden stick to mix the sensitizer and the emulsion together. The color of the emulsion should change from blue to green. There should also be small bubbles forming in the emulsion. Place the lid loosely back on the emulsion and place it in a dark area or room for an hour. After an hour, check that all the small bubbles in the emulsion have disappeared. If they do not disappear after an hour, leave the emulsion to sit for another hour until the bubbles are gone. Apply the emulsion on the screen. In a very dim room or with a low red light, drip a line of photo emulsion across the screen and use a squeegee to spread it around. The emulsion will leak through the screen, so be sure to squeegee both sides of the screen. You can also use a coating tray to apply the emulsion to the screen. Do this by placing the screen on a clean towel and tilting it away from you slightly. Place the coating tray at the bottom of the screen and carefully pour the emulsion on the screen as you move the tray up the screen. Leave the emulsion to dry in a completely black room for about twenty minutes. Use a fan to help the screen dry. Place the transparency down backward on the screen. Now you\u2019re ready to burn your image into the emulsion. Do this by placing the screen flat, placing the transparency down backward, and placing a piece of glass over the transparency to ensure that it doesn\u2019t move. Burn the design into the emulsion. A 500-watt lightbulb will burn the transparency image into the emulsion in roughly fifteen minutes. The exact times for this process depend on the light and emulsion you use. Specific directions for the light needed should be on the packaging of the purchased emulsion. Rinse the screen. Let the screen soak in a thin layer of water for about two minutes. Then rinse any excess emulsion off with a hose or in the shower. Place waterproof tape around the edges of the underside of the screen. The flat side of the screen will go facedown on the shirt, and the side with the frame is where you will use the ink. To make sure no ink ends up leaking around the frame, use waterproof tape to secure around the edges where the screen stretches over the frame. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3b\\/Design-Your-Own-T-Shirt-Step-19.jpg\\/v4-460px-Design-Your-Own-T-Shirt-Step-19.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/3\\/3b\\/Design-Your-Own-T-Shirt-Step-19.jpg\\/v4-760px-Design-Your-Own-T-Shirt-Step-19.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Lay your t-shirt on a flat surface. Make sure there are no wrinkles. Place the screen on top of the t-shirt, where you would like your design to be. Place the screen on top, making sure that the screen and design are aligned. Clip your shirt down to a firm piece of cardboard. Doing this will ensure your t-shirt remains flat and unwrinkled. It will also make it easier to move your t-shirt to a safe spot later to dry. If possible, have a friend hold the screen down tight while you spread the ink. Spread a tablespoon of screen printing ink on the top of the screen. Using your squeegee, coat the screen by spreading the line of ink from top to bottom. The mesh is actually quite thick, so this step is more of a primer. Use very light pressure so you don\u2019t push any ink through the screen. Squeegee the screen. With the screen flooded, you\u2019re ready to transfer the design to the shirt. Use the squeegee at a 45\u00b0 angle in both hands to evenly distribute the pressure. If possible, ask a friend to hold the screen in place. Drag the ink back up across the flooded screen over the design. Cure the ink. Using a hairdryer, apply even heat to the design for several minutes. Cure the ink before using the next screen to add additional layers of the graphic in different colors. If you use the proper screen-printing technique and cure it, your t-shirt will be washing machine safe. Wash your screen once you are done making your shirts. Use cold water and scrub it with a sponge to get the ink out. Let the screen air dry. Stenciling Your Design Gather your materials. To stencil your design onto a t-shirt, you will need:\nA black and white print out of your design. Its important to use a black and white printout of your design so it will be easy to trace. A piece of contact paper, or a transparency\nA craft knife, or exacto knife\nA plain t-shirt\nA piece of cardboard big enough to cover the front area of the shirt Tape the design to a piece of contact paper. Contact paper is clear paper used for covering books. It has a normal side and a sticky side that peels off. You want to tape your paper to the peeling side so that the design is visible through the front of the contact paper\u2014the non-sticky side. You can also use a piece of transparency or clear paper. Attach it to the printout of your design with tape. Use a sharp craft knife to cut out the black parts of the design. Lay the attached papers on a flat surface, like a table. Trace the lines with the craft knife or an exacto knife. Keep in mind the black parts you cut out are the parts of the design that will be filled with paint. Peel the sticky side off the contact paper. Remove the normal paper with the design from the contact paper as well. Place the sticky stencil onto the t-shirt, making sure it is straight and not wrinkled. If you are using a transparency or clear paper instead of contact paper, attach the transparency to the shirt with tape. Place a piece of cardboard inside the t-shirt. Doing this separates the front and back so the ink doesn\u2019t bleed through to the other side. Use a sponge brush to paint on the fabric paint. Only put paint on the spots that have been cut out of the contact paper\u2014the spots that will be painted in dark on the t-shirt. Let the paint dry. Test the paint by gently touching the painted spots. If paint comes away on your finger, it is not fully dry. Peel the contact paper off of the t-shirt when the paint is dry. You will now have a stenciled on t-shirt. You can use the stencil to make another shirt if you want more than one stenciled t-shirt. Bleach Painting Your Design Use bleach safely. Bleach painting is a fun, easy, and inexpensive way to create a design on a t-shirt, especially text based designs. But, remember bleach is toxic, so keep it out of reach of children. Always protect your eyes, clothing, and any open cuts from coming into contact with bleach. If you have sensitive skin, you should wear thin kitchen gloves while bleach painting. Gather your supplies. You will need:\nFabric safe household bleach\nA synthetic bristle paint brush (go for an inexpensive one, as you\u2019ll just be bleaching it anyway!) A glass or ceramic bowl\nA white towel or rag\nWhite chalk\nA piece of cardboard\nA dark colored cotton blend shirt\nYou can try this method on a lighter colored shirt, but the bleach painting will show up better on darker colors. Place your shirt on a flat surface. Then, slide the piece of cardboard inside your shirt. It will act as an even surface as you write your design. It will also stop the bleach from bleeding through the back of your shirt. Use the white chalk to sketch out your design on the shirt. This could be your favorite saying (\u201cBazinga!\u201d \u201cReach for the Stars\u201d), the name of your band, or the logo of your brand. Don\u2019t worry if you need the smudge out the chalk lines and re-sketch the design. The chalk lines will wash out once you\u2019ve completed the bleach painting. Fold the sides of the shirt under the cardboard. Secure the shirt to the cardboard with elastics or small clips. This will keep the cardboard from slipping while you bleach paint. Prepare the bleach. Pour a few cups of the bleach into the glass or ceramic bowl. Use a towel to wipe up any drips. You don\u2019t want any drops of bleach to end up on your clothing. Dip your brush into the bleach. Drag it on the edge of the bowl to eliminate any dripping. Use steady strokes to trace the chalk lines of your design. For an even bleach line, reload your brush every two inches. The fabric will quickly soak up the liquid so work quickly, but with a steady hand. Finish tracing your design. Then, take a break to allow the bleach to react with the fabric of the shirt. Look over the shirt. Are there any uneven spots or light areas? If so, go back in with your bleach filled brush and even out the design. Let the shirt sit in the sun for at least an hour. This will allow the bleach to process and lighten. Depending on the cotton content of your shirt, the color of your design will range from dark red, to orange, to pink, or even white. Rinse and hand wash your shirt. Hang it to dry. Admire your new permanent bleach design. Wash the shirt with like colors. The chalk lines should wash out, leaving only the bleach design.",
