Alternatively, if your cup is made with origami paper, fill it with small trinkets or snacks. Origami cups are great for storing coins, paperclips, and candy. If you are putting liquid into your cup, you will need to drink it relatively fast as the cup is only water-resistant rather than watertight. Try to drink your beverage within 30 minutes. Your paper cup may hold liquid for a longer or shorter period of time depending on how tightly and accurately it has been folded. Never put hot beverages into your paper cup. Origami paper cups are also commonly used for storing small stuffed animals, pens, flowers, and small children\u2019s toys."
