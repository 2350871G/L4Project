Making your bedroom feel like a hotel room can help you escape your everyday life and move into a more satisfying love life. Put noise-cancelling curtains on your windows and soft, luxurious blankets on your bed. If you have any pets, be sure that they are out of the room during your intimate encounters. It can really kill the mood if your dog jumps up on the bed and decides that it wants kisses, too."

Be sure to keep your sheets clean and smelling nice by washing them regularly. You might also want to spray your sheets with a linen spray to keep them smelling good. If you do this, make sure you don\u2019t go overboard \u2014 an overpowering scent will be off-putting."

Avoid choosing candles that are too heavily scented, as these can be off-putting. To be safe, stick to unscented candles. If you really want to use scented candles, try one of these scents: pumpkin pie, licorice, lavender, cinnamon buns, or cucumber. Avoid cherry, cranberry, chocolate, and smokey scents."

Doing this will make intimate encounters more likely. Resist the urge to check your phone while being intimate with someone. A study showed that 1 in 10 people do this. If you\u2019re one of those people, remove the temptation by leaving your phone on silent in the other room."

It will make them feel like you just had to have them. Just don\u2019t be offended if they have to pull away momentarily to pee or remove any heavy bags, jackets etc.! Standing upright will also make intimate oral acts feel more intense as the blood rushes downward. Be sure that your partner trusts you before trying this one. If your partner has previously been attacked or assaulted, you should speak to your partner before trying this, as it could trigger painful memories."

The winner of the game gets his/her fantasy acted out. Be realistic with your fantasy. Make sure that it won\u2019t hurt the other person\u2019s feelings or be too expensive to achieve. Choose your game wisely. A game like Monopoly may take hours to finish, which is fine as long as you\u2019re not planning to act out the fantasy directly afterwards, as you might both be tired by then!"

If you feel insecure about yourself, watching a dirty movie may not be a good decision, as you may wind up feeling inferior to the people you see onscreen.

As your partner makes coffee/prepares breakfast, walk up behind him/her, wrap your arms around his/her waist or hips, and gently kiss his/her neck. While you're out for dinner or drinks, casually caress your partner\u2019s leg, moving your hand up as high as possible without it being creepy. This should give him/her a hint that you\u2019re thinking about getting intimate. Exchanging massages is another great way to build arousal from touch."

Find a song that gets you in the mood, create a strip routine that goes with it, set the mood (candles, curtains etc. ), and perform for your partner. The striptease can be as simple or complicated as you want. The key is to be yourself and do something that makes you feel good. If you\u2019re funny and like to make your partner laugh, incorporate that into the routine; if you\u2019re more of a slow and sultry type, do a slow and sultry routine. If you can\u2019t dance, practise  taking off your clothes in a sexy way without having to do much dancing."

If you think that your dull love life might be reflecting problems in the relationship, you need to talk to your partner about your concerns. You might find it useful to sit down and write your thoughts into a journal. This will help you clarify what you want to say when you talk to your partner.

Touching your partner in intimate but not overtly sexual ways can help build a physical intimacy between the two of you. As your partner makes coffee/prepares breakfast, walk up behind him/her, wrap your arms around his/her waist or hips, and gently kiss his/her neck. While you're out for dinner or drinks, casually caress your partner\u2019s leg, moving your hand up as high as possible without it being creepy. This should give him/her a hint that you\u2019re thinking about getting intimate. Exchanging massages is another great way to build arousal from touch. Do a striptease. This is more commonly done by women for their partners, but men can do it too. Find a song that gets you in the mood, create a strip routine that goes with it, set the mood (candles, curtains etc. ), and perform for your partner. The striptease can be as simple or complicated as you want. The key is to be yourself and do something that makes you feel good. If you\u2019re funny and like to make your partner laugh, incorporate that into the routine; if you\u2019re more of a slow and sultry type, do a slow and sultry routine. If you can\u2019t dance, practise  taking off your clothes in a sexy way without having to do much dancing. Bonding with Your Partner Work on resolving any issues you may have. A dull love life doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you and your partner are having problems, but relationship problems can cause bedroom problems. If you think that your dull love life might be reflecting problems in the relationship, you need to talk to your partner about your concerns. You might find it useful to sit down and write your thoughts into a journal. This will help you clarify what you want to say when you talk to your partner. If either of you struggle with sexual shame, emotional distance or insecurity, it may be difficult to become aroused. Talking about these things can boost your intimacy. Spend quality time together. Have a regular date night at least once a month and/or a short cuddle session a couple of times a week. Schedule these in and stick to them. Doing things like this will show your partner that you value the relationship, and will help you two feel closer to one another. The stronger emotional connection that results from this will lead to a stronger physical connection, too. Do new things together. Doing new things together is a great way to get out of that slump and bond with your partner. Experiencing something new together builds memories and helps the two of you feel like a team. The excitement of trying something new can translate to excitement in the bedroom. Cook together. Cooking together is a nice way to bond with your partner. You might even try different recipes that contain aphrodisiacs. Popular aphrodisiacs include oysters, salmon, pine nuts, and foods containing capsaicin. Exercise together. Most people have heard of the post-exercise high. It happens because exercise stimulates the production of dopamine, the hormone that makes you feel good and boosts your sex drive. Even if you don\u2019t have a post-workout makeout session, working out together will boost intimacy and build confidence. If exercise isn\u2019t your thing, explore other things that you can regularly do together \u2014 for example, cooking, fishing, playing music, or any other hobby that you may both enjoy. Laugh together. Watch a standup comedy special or a funny sitcom or movie. Studies have shown that laughing gets your cardiovascular system working, resulting in better performance in bed. Laughing together can also help you have fun despite any life stress you may be dealing with at the moment. It\u2019s important to make time to have fun in each other\u2019s company, no matter how stressful life may be. Make your partner feel desired. For both men and women, feeling desired is hugely important to arousal and comfort in the bedroom. There are many ways to make your partner feel desired. Some of these include compliments, physical touch, and flirtatious texts. Doing nice things for your partner beyond the bedroom can help make them feel desired. Even just telling them to relax while you do the dishes, or bringing them home a special treat should have a positive effect. Go to a sex shop together. Agree that the two of you will buy one thing from the shop, whether it\u2019s a pair of sexy dice, an erotic novel, lubricant, or something more adventurous. Have fun while you\u2019re there \u2014 some of things you see will be outright hilarious, and it\u2019s okay to laugh. Just try not to laugh too hard, lest you scare or offend some of the other customers. Commit to a month of daily intimacy. Tell your partner that you\u2019d like to spice things up a bit by being intimate every day this month. It may feel too rigid to make plans like that, but it will also build anticipation. If he/she agrees, you might even sit down and make a calendar of the things you will do each day. It doesn\u2019t have to be overly specific \u2014 for example, one day you could \u201chave a quickie\u201d or \u201cuse a toy\u201d.",
