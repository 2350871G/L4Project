Luckily, there's a faster and easier approach. Use your hand to toss the metal lightly up and let it come back down (or you can just lift it and lower it quickly without it leaving your hand). Since gold is more dense than brass, it will feel heavier than you might expect. Since brass has a lower density, it will feel lighter."
