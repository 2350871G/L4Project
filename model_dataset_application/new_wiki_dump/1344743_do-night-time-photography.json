          "headline":"Choose a digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera with manual mode.",
          "description":"You\u2019ll want a camera that lets you adjust how much light and movement you can capture. Doing nighttime photography requires you to be in control of these changes, rather than relying on a camera\u2019s automatic mode. You may also use a film SLR camera. While these cameras will take nice pictures at night, they are more difficult to use. Digital SLRs now provide the same capabilities as film cameras, so make a choice depending on your preferences."

        {
          "headline":"Use a wide-angle lens.",
          "description":"Lens size, or focal length, is measured in millimeters. Wide-angle lenses have smaller focal lengths than typical lenses, ranging from about 35 to 10 mm. Wide-angle lens allow you to  let in more light in order to capture broader scenes than the naked eye. This makes them perfect for nighttime photography. Wide-angle lens are especially recommended when shooting the night sky."

        {
          "headline":"Invest in a tripod.",
          "description":"It\u2019s important to keep your camera as stable as possible when taking pictures at night. Because you\u2019ll be experimenting with the amount of time your shutter remains open to let in light, you\u2019ll need an extremely still camera. This will minimize any blurriness to give you sharp and clear images. If you\u2019re going to be doing a lot of walking to reach your spot, try a lightweight aluminum tripod. If you\u2019re concerned about your camera\u2019s stability, purchase a large and sturdy carbon-fiber tripod. Be aware that these tripods are both heavier and more expensive than alternatives."

          "headline":"Consider using a shutter release cable or remote.",
          "description":"When you push the button on your camera to take a shot, you create a small amount of vibration. To avoid this movement, use a cable or wireless remote that allows you to push the button from a distance. If you don\u2019t have a cable or remote shutter release, use your camera\u2019s self-timer feature. This will allow you to engage the shot and then step away from the camera."

If you\u2019re in total darkness, a flashlight is essential for safety. Your flashlight may also work as an external flash bulb. You can shine it on your subject to help your camera focus on that subject."

          "headline":"Shoot your images in RAW mode.",
          "description":"RAW is a type of file format for images. Unlike JPEG files, RAW files store all the data recorded by your camera\u2019s sensor when you snap a photograph. JPEG files compress some of this data. You\u2019ll generally want to make some post-photography edits with nighttime photographs, and taking RAW files gives you more control over those adjustments. RAW files also record higher levels of brightness, or steps from black to white, than JPEGs. This gives you a smoother transition in color tone, a crucial feature for nighttime pictures."

          "description":"The aperture is the size of the opening in your camera\u2019s lens,  measured in f-stops. Moving from one f-stop to the next doubles or halves the size of the opening and, as a result, the amount of light you let in. Start with a small f-stop, such as f/2.8, to let in a higher amount of light. Wide-open apertures are optimal for shots of the starry night sky. Experiment with higher f-stops, such as f/16, f/18, or f/22, for low-light exposure. Low lighting can also produce great nighttime shots, especially if you\u2019re photographing landscapes that have streetlights."

This affects the level of light let in and the amount of movement that\u2019s captured. For night shooting, start with slow shutter speeds, such as 10-30 seconds. This long exposure time should provide you with excellent shots of the stars, nighttime traffic, or cityscapes."

        {
          "headline":"Increase your camera\u2019s sensitivity to light with a high ISO.",
          "description":"The ISO refers to the sensitivity of your camera\u2019s image sensor to light. The lower the ISO, the less sensitive the camera is to light, which results in less grain in your image. Higher ISOs of above 500 will give you more light sensitivity and more grain, which is important for nighttime photography. If you\u2019re worried about \u201cnoisy,\u201d or overly grainy shots, you can experiment with lower ISOs of between 100 and 500."

This readout gives you the exposure value of your image, which indicates whether your image will be properly exposed based the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. You want your light meter to hover just over zero, rather than a negative or positive number. Adjust your aperture, shutter speed, and ISO based on your needs for the photograph while also aiming for zero."

Try using a flashlight or headlamp for a small amount of extra light to help your camera focus. These small sources won\u2019t add too much artificial light to the shot. Use your car\u2019s headlights or portable studio lights to illuminate a large object like a building or rock structure. Bring shields just in case you need to dampen the amount of light you receive from these larger sources. Remember to turn off your camera\u2019s built-in flash, as this will wash out the entire landscape."
