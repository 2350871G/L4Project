In some states, the height of the driveway above even ground and the width of the driveway you plan to make it may each determine whether or not you need to pull a permit. If your neighborhood has a homeowner\u2019s association, they may also have rules about how and where you install your driveway.

You will want to consider the overall length and width, as well as where you\u2019ll park your vehicles and whether or not you\u2019ll need space to turn around. In general, it\u2019s recommended that you allow at least 18 feet (5.5 m) to 20 feet (6.1 m) for a car and 22 feet (6.7 m) to 24 feet (7.3 m) for vans or trucks. A single vehicle needs a width of 10 feet (3.0 m) to 12 feet (3.7 m). Remember, every foot you add to the length of width of the driveway increases the expense significantly.

To determine how many cubic yards of concrete you\u2019ll need, multiply the length of your driveway by the width, then multiply that number by .35 (which is 4 inches (10 cm) in terms of feet). Take that final figure and divide it by 27, which is the number of cubic feet in one cubic yard. Multiply the length by the width and depth, then divide that figure by 27. Your answer will be how much concrete to order (in cubic yards). You may want to increase your order by about 10% to allow for spillages and mistakes."

Pine board that measures 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 4 inches (10 cm) is usually sufficient for laying a driveway, as well as a number of 4 inches (10 cm) stakes. Your pine board will need to be long enough to enclose the entire driveway as you pour the concrete."

If the soil is too loamy, add sand or gravel to make it level. Whether you add material or not, you should compact the soil to make it firm and even. You can create a base using gravel or crushed rock, filling soft spots with extra material. Vibratory plate compactors and rammers can be used to compact and flatten the soil and gravel you lay down."

Grading is done by placing a straightedge or tying a string across the top of your forms and measuring down to the soil, to the correct depth. When you spot areas that aren\u2019t even with the rest, add material or remove it to make the grade even. Add gravel or crushed rock to places that aren\u2019t as high as the rest."

The important thing is that the compaction of the soil is what will support the weight of the concrete, as well as the subsequent load of vehicles using the drive, so it\u2019s important to have compacted, stable fill material. Adding a little water as you compact the material can make the process more effective. You may need to use more fill material on looser soil to keep it even."

Another option is to have polypropylene fiber reinforcing added to the concrete mixture at the concrete plant. Adding a steel reinforcement will significantly increase the strength of your driveway and is highly recommended.
