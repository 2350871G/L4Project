The legless girl will continue to crawl after you, leaving a trail of blood. An event will occur, and instead of running away, Viola will finally speak to the legless girl, remarking on her stubbornness before stabbing her in the eye with the knife you retrieved earlier. Spoilers: Viola, the character you've been using, reveals that she's the true witch, and the real Viola, whom she had befriended and convinced to switch bodies with her, is trapped in Ellen's mutilated body. Ellen admits that she used Viola's compassion and pity to her advantage until they switched bodies, with a promise of returning it back after a day. However, Ellen refused to return it afterward. Ellen also explains how the house guided her out the whole way and also senses that the real Viola is worried for her father. Ellen promised her that she will give him Viola's share of love. Viola's father will show up and rush toward Ellen, mistaking her as his daughter because of her appearance. The legless girl, the real Viola, tries to call out to him, but in the state of panic, he shoots her twice in the head. The father and Ellen leave the forest after that, but Ellen can be seen giggling before exiting the frame."

Notice that in the regular endings, Viola will only encounter a black cat's corpse in this hallway, but since you avoided the black cat, this event will be triggered. In a brief speech, the cat will say that it knew Viola would not need its help and that the house acknowledges its true master. The cat will then say \u201cEllen, my faithful witch\u201d before lying dead on the floor. Take note that halfway through the dialogue, the name Black Cat will change to Demon, and right after its speech, if you choose to investigate the body, it will say \u201cThe corpse of a black cat possessed by a demon.\u201d\nSpoilers: At the regular ending, when you read the witch's diary, it barely explains the truth behind Ellen's body, but in this secret ending, it will unlock more content. It goes into greater detail of the reason why Ellen's body is in its mutilated state after switching with Viola. Ellen in Viola's body gouged her eyes and cut off her legs so that Viola in Ellen's body could not try to find help. She was also given a throat burning medicine that made her unable to speak, ensuring that she could never talk to anyone. The rest of the ending will be identical to either the good ending and the bad truth ending, depending on the player's actions."
