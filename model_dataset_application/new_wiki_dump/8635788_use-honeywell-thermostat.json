However, if you choose personal installation, you\u2019ll want to follow the directions very carefully as some thermostats require direct wiring into high voltage connections. Other Honeywell thermostats have certain technological requirements, another aspect that a HVAC expert can manage.

Lyric thermostats, for example, suggest that you use Apple\u2019s HomeKit for installation and control of the unit. There is also a generic Lyric app available.
