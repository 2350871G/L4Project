Outside of determining where figures and objects are in the composition, you\u2019ll need to look for a few other important elements. With your drawing laid out in front of you, look for:\nThe light source and the direction of the light. The light will determine what areas need more stippling and what areas need less. The value of the drawing. This is where on the grayscale each of the colors (or shades) lie - how dark or light the colors are. Value is closely related to light. The shapes in the drawing. You\u2019ll be creating all the figures and objects without using any lines, so pay attention to the shapes that compose the figures, and recreate them with your stippling."

          "description":"Because stippling is just the process of creating hundreds of tiny dots that make up an image, you can use many different media for creating the dots. Higher quality pointillism pieces are done with more dots per square inch, meaning that they were made with a drawing utensil that allowed for very small dots to be made. Keep this in mind, because although you can use about any medium you want to create your image, the smaller the mark that is made, the more realistic your image will look. Possible media for stippling include:\nA fine point pen. Most artists who do high-quality stippling use a pen with a .03 or .005 inch (0.0 cm) nib. This allows for tiny dots and plenty of shading. Pencils - colored or otherwise. Although by using pencil you run the risk of smearing the graphite and blending the color, you can use it to create small dots. Colored pencil is less likely to smear than graphite, and will add a bit more interest (and difficulty) to your image. Paint. Paint is typically considered the most difficult medium to stipple with, because it is much easier to accidentally create a stroke/line than it is with pen or pencil."

          "description":"Before you start making any dots, you need to decide how dense you will draw them. A more detailed image can be made with a higher density of dots. Keep in mind that an image with lots of dark values will need more stippling than an image with plenty of light. Try doing a set of dots on a piece of test paper, creating different shades of gray (or colors, if you\u2019re using colored pencil) by spacing out the dots different amounts. You can then reference this test paper as you create your final project. The higher the density of dots, the more time it will take to recreate an image. If you don\u2019t want to put a lot of time into the project but still need dark values, try using a pen with a larger nib (such as .1) or a different medium that creates larger spots."

Start with the darkest point, and then work around the image, filling in all the dark areas. Eventually, begin adding in the lighter areas by adding dots that are spaced further apart from each other. As you\u2019re stippling, remember to:\nKeep all the dots evenly spaced. Although you can put some dots close together and others far apart, the finished work will look more attractive if the dots are evenly spaced. Avoid making dashes. Nothing will ruin your stippling project faster than adding dashes instead of dots. Be careful to always lift your pen (or other utensil) completely off the paper before setting it back down. Move slowly. Speed is not your friend when stippling. You\u2019ll be much more likely to create a significant mistake if you\u2019re working quickly, than if you are patient and take your time. Stippling is a very time-intensive practice, so be prepared to put many hours (or weeks!) into a single project."

For example, stipple all your dots in rows/columns or diagonal lines. These patterns will only be noticeable close-up and in the light (emptier) spaces."

If your stippling is dense, from far away the dots should look like shapes that were drawn, rather than just dots."
