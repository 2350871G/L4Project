          "headline":"Get a pair of carbon steel kitchen or poultry shears.",
          "description":"Turkey bones are pretty tough to cut through, so spatchcocking requires a sharp and effective tool. Look for high-quality shears made of carbon steel, which is a stronger material than simple stainless steel. The shears should also have tiny serrations that provide better grip as you cut through food. You can also use a sharp knife, but shears give you more control over your cutting. This makes the process safer."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cut just to the left and right of the backbone.",
          "description":"Place the turkey on a stable surface with the drumsticks facing up and the breasts facing down. Locate the backbone in the middle of the bird. There should be a hole directly above the drumsticks, which might contain a bag full of giblets. Remove the bag and position your shears at the bottom of the backbone (right at the top of the hole) to cut it out. It might take some patience and elbow grease to make these two cuts. Keep at it and take a break if you need one. Once you\u2019ve removed the backbone, put it aside with the giblets to make turkey stock for your gravy."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Open up the bird to expose the keel bone.",
          "description":"Spread the turkey apart slightly and look down into the center of the opened-up bird. At the bottom of the bird, you\u2019ll see the keel bone, which extends downward from the breastbone. The keel bone is essentially a mirror image of the backbone, running vertically from the top to the bottom of the bird."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Slide the tip of a sharp knife along the length of the keel bone.",
          "description":"This will make it easier to crack the bone and flatten the turkey. You don\u2019t need to cut the bird in half or make a deep cut. Just score the bone by applying a healthy amount of even, steady pressure as you move the knife."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Turn the turkey over and press on it until you hear a crack.",
          "description":"Pick up the bird with both hands and flip the bird so the the opened-up side is face down on your kitchen surface. Place your hands on the breasts and push. You should hear a cracking sound as the bird flattens out. Once the bottom of the bird is flush with your kitchen surface, stop pressing."

          "headline":"Tuck the wingtips under the breasts to prepare for roasting.",
          "description":"The wingtips should be resting on the two breasts. Gently bend them out and over the tops of the breasts. Then, bend them inwards again, positioning the tips under the front of the bird. This will allow the the wings to cook through completely."

          "description":"Wash the inside and outside of your turkey in cold water before you brine it. Then make a brining solution and soak your spatchcocked bird in the liquid overnight. Brining may add a bit of extra flavor and moisture to your turkey, but it\u2019s also messy and time-consuming. Check that the pot you plan to use to soak your turkey fits in your fridge before you start the brining process. A good recipe for brining solution should include vegetable broth or water, salt, and an assortment of herbs. If you choose a roasting recipe that calls for lots of herbs and basting, you probably don\u2019t need to brine."

          "description":"Spatchcocking allows you to cook your turkey at a higher temperature than you normally would. The total cook time should be about an hour and a half. Give the oven about 5 to 10 minutes to heat up completely. You can also grill your turkey if you\u2019d like."

Next, rub either melted butter or olive oil over the entire surface of the skin. Season the bird with sea salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, and sage. Follow your recipe for precise measurements, but expect to use about \u20442 cup (120 ml) of oil or butter and a tablespoon (14.8 mL) of each of the herbs for the rub. You should also rinse and pat dry your brined turkey. This will prevent it from being overly salty."

They should create a layer for the bird to rest on. After you\u2019ve placed the bird on top of the veggies and herbs, add \u20442 cup (120 ml) water to the sheet pan. Alternatively, you can use a wire rack to lift the bird off the bottom of the pan. The vegetables and herbs will give your turkey and gravy more flavor, however. Follow your recipe for specific instructions on which vegetables (and how many) to place in your pan."

After the half hour is up, use a brush to cover the skin in the liquid. You can also use a bulb baster to suck up some of the juices in the pan and drip those over the turkey\u2019s skin. After the first baste, continue to baste every 20 minutes until your bird is done."

Use a meat thermometer to keep track of the temperature of the bird. Insert it into the thickest part of the thigh (which is on the side of the bird, attached to the drumsticks). Once the thermometer reads 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C), it\u2019s time to take the bird out of the oven! This cook time is for a 12 to 14 pound (5.4-6.3 kg) turkey. Make adjustments if you\u2019re cooking a smaller or larger bird by continuously checking the thermometer and removing the turkey from the oven as soon as it hits 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C)."

Allowing the turkey to rest locks the flavor and juiciness into the meat. Let smaller birds rest for at least 20 minutes and larger birds for up to 40 minutes."
