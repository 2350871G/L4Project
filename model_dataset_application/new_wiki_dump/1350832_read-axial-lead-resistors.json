A silver band indicates that the actual resistance of the resistor will be within 10 percent of the number indicated by the coding. These values are important to calculate the variations that will occur from circuit to circuit randomly as more parts of the circuit are built."

(Your resistor might have four bands in addition to the tolerance band, in this case just write down all four numbers.) Change the last digit of the coded number to a number of zeros that are to be added to a base value indicated by the preceding numbers. For example, a coded number of 623 would require the addition of 3 zeros to the base value of 62, making the number 62000. If the third band had indicated that 0 zeros are to be added (a coded number of 620), then the number would become 62. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/4d\\/Read-Resistors-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Read-Resistors-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/4d\\/Read-Resistors-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Read-Resistors-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"
