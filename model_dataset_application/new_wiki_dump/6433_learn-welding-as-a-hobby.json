If you\u2019ve practiced using a variety of methods, choose the method you like best. The 2 most common methods for beginners are gas metal arc welding (MIG) and arc welding, also referred to as stick welding. Stick and MIG welding equipment is cheaper and easier to learn than other methods. TIG welding, otherwise known as gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), and flux-cored welding, are more complex forms of welding that should be avoided if you\u2019re a beginner."

Performing Welding Basics Attach the welder's ground clamp to your workstation. It's important to ground the welder or you may electrocute yourself as you weld. The ground clamp should be attached to a flexible hose coming from your welder. Attach the clamp to the table or workstation that you plan on welding on. Position the tip of the gun at a 20-degree angle as you weld. Always hold your welding gun with 2 hands. Position the tip of the gun towards the metal, at a 20-degree angle so that you can push the weld away from you. Remember to wear your welding gloves.

Check the tubes and wires attached to the welder and make sure that they are in good condition. Check the MIG welding gun's trigger and make sure that there is a wire properly feeding out of the tip of the gun.

As you weld, make sure that you move slowly in small circular motions over the metal. If you notice that the welding machine isn't working properly, adjust the settings. Learning Stick Welding Basics Set the welding machine to DC positive polarity. Direct current, or DC positive, allows for a greater level of penetration than alternating current, or AC, polarity. This makes it easier for first-time welders to create a uniform bead as they begin to weld. Set the amperage to the same level as the stick you're using. The stick that attaches to your welding gun is an electrode and is often referred to as the \"rod.\" Different rods will have specifications found on their packaging or in their instruction manuals that explain the proper corresponding amperage that your machine needs. Tap your rod against metal to start it up. The electrode should be tightened in the welding gun before you start. Lightly strike the rod against the metal like a match to start the weld. When it successfully starts welding, you'll see an electric arc coming from the electrode on your gun. Remember to wear a non-flammable apron, welding mask, and gloves before you weld. Getting Your Welding Equipment Purchase an auto-darkening welding helmet. The light that welding gives off is incredibly bright and can cause permanent damage to your eyesight. In addition to protecting your eyes, a full-face welding helmet will prevent sparks and metal debris from being shot into your face as you weld. You should never weld a piece of metal without having full face and eye protection first. An auto-darkening welding helmet will prevent you from having to lift up your helmet when you stop welding.
