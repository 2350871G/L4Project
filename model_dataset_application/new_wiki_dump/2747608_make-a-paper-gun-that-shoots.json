It should look something like a small cardboard paper towel roll. This is your mold, and you'll use it to help roll the rest of the paper tubes needed to make a paper pistol.

These new ones need to be able to slide in and out of the older tubes. To get them thinner, roll them without the guide.

You then hot glue it to the back of the handle, curving it around the front and under your trigger guard, if you have one. The goal is to close off all of the unnecessary openings in the tubes on the handle of the gun, but the essential one to close is the one right behind the trigger. DO NOT close up the trigger chamber. This needs to be open to load and fire the gun. In the end, you'll create an \"outline\" of sorts of the bottom of the gun.

To start, gathering the following:\nSeveral pieces of durable paper (8.5x11\", any color)\nScotch tape\nScissors\nRuler\nMarker\nHot Glue\nA rubber band Roll your first piece of paper into a cylinder, starting in the corner and working up.

The excess tube should be on the side the handle slants towards. In other words, if you were holding the gun up to shoot, the extra 3cm would point back at you. This is going to be the \"trigger tube\" of the gun. Glue the two long, 15cm tubes together, then attach them to the top of the gun. This is the barrel of your pistol, so it needs to point away from you, of course. Line up the back of the barrel with roughly the center of your handle, then hot glue it in place. Roll two thinner paper tubes. This time, don't worry about there being a space. Roll up some paper (it is nice if you can use a different color) into round tubes just a bit thinner than your first set. These new ones need to be able to slide in and out of the older tubes. To get them thinner, roll them without the guide. You should also cut off the last 4-5\" triangular inches of paper as you're rolling the tubes to decrease the thickening paper in the center of the tube. Bend a thin tube into a U so that it slides into the trigger tube and the top tube of the handle. Trim away the excess so that there is only 1/4\" of tube poking out of the back of the trigger chamber and nothing poking out of the back of the handle. The bend in the U is on the barrel side. This will be your trigger -- when you pull the trigger back, this little extra bit should pop out the back of the trigger chamber. Make sure that the tube can slide freely back and forth.

Hot glue the leftover tube to the bottom of the barrel and cut off any excess. Flatten a thin paper tube with your fingers, then use it to \"close off\" the back of the handle. This tube should be flattened into a long, thin rectangular strip. You then hot glue it to the back of the handle, curving it around the front and under your trigger guard, if you have one. The goal is to close off all of the unnecessary openings in the tubes on the handle of the gun, but the essential one to close is the one right behind the trigger. DO NOT close up the trigger chamber. This needs to be open to load and fire the gun. In the end, you'll create an \"outline\" of sorts of the bottom of the gun. This is why using another color looks so good. Take the spring out of an old pen and place it in the top tube of the barrel. Remove the trigger, and put in the spring so that it presses against the outline tube. This will allow your trigger to spring back automatically after you shoot the gun. Make the rubber band trigger and firing mechanism. Fold a piece of origami paper in half twice, forming a long, thin line of paper. Roll this line into a squat tube. Secure the tube with a single piece of scotch tape and trim down the sides to smooth them out. This should look like a tiny toilet paper roll. Then...\nTake your scissors and cut the tube open. Then, take your rubber band and place it inside the tube. Tape the tube back together. You should now have a small, squat paper roll with a rubber band running through it. This is the trigger of your gun. Slide your rubber-band trigger into the bottom tube of the barrel. Cut the ends so that, with the rubber banded end as close to the back of the barrel as you can get it, not part of the tube pokes out of the front of barrel. Hook the rubber band up to the front of the barrel, so it is notched between the two tubes. Make sure the back of the trigger rests right at the opening of trigger chamber. When you pull the trigger back, the bit of tube that pokes out unhooks the trigger, which releases the rubber band and shoots your bullets. Load and shoot your paper bullets. Now, your gun should shoot. Roll bits of origami paper into small balls. Place a ball into the end of the gun opposite the handle and trigger, and hook the rubber band up. Pull the trigger to release the rubber band, shooting the trigger tube forward and firing your bullets. The ball should shoot out of the gun. Making an Origami Pistol Prepare two strips of paper, folding them into long, thin strips. To start making an origami gun, you'll need to prepare two sheets of paper. Take a large rectangular sheet of origami paper. Fold it in half and tear it into two smaller, wider rectangles. You will fold each smaller sheet using the following process:\nFold the rectangle in half from top to bottom, creating a smaller, narrower rectangle. Then, unfold the paper.

Then, fold the other half inward, so the end of the paper lines up with crease. The two ends of the paper should meet at the crease of the paper. Now, fold the paper inward along the crease. You should have a long, thin strip of folded paper. Fold one strip into a horseshoe Take one strip of paper and fold it in half from end to end. Then, unfold the paper. The crease at the center of the strip should divide it into two halves. Fold the end of the right half at a 90-degree angle. Then, fold the other half into a 90-degree angle. The paper should look something like a small paper horseshoe. The width of the center, horizontal section should be twice the width of your long pieces. Place the strip to the right of your center line. Then fold the \"arm\" of the horseshoe right where it meets the thin strip in the center. Refold the arms of the horseshoe so that they angle diagonally inward. Keeping the fold starting in the same place, re-angle the horseshoe so it looks a bit like a squared teardrop. There should be a nice triangle in the middle. Fold the triangle shape in half, then press it together to get a flat \"handle\" shape for your pistol. It will be a bit like a lower-case \"L,\" with a long strip and slight curvy bit at the end. You should also fold your long, thin strip of paper in half too. Entwine the other strip with the first by pushing the ends of the strip into the openings in the handle. Things can get a bit tricky here, so go slowly. Take your second strip of paper and fold it in half from end to end. You will be inserting this strip into the handle:\nPull the handle apart slightly. The bent down portion should have two small openings. Feed either end of the second strip through these openings. Pull both ends of the second folded strip through the openings of the horseshoe. Keep pulling until the two strips are forming a wide angle of roughly 110 degrees. The two ends of the strip will form the \"barrel\" of the pistol. Adjust until your gun has a trigger, then staple the handle and barrel to keep the paper from moving. You should now be able to see the outline of a gun. There should be a small folded strip of paper hanging out just underneath the gun's barrel. Pull down on this strip of paper gently, until it hangs down below the gun. You should now be able to bend this handle in and out like a trigger. Using a precision art knife, cut a small 1/2\" notch right above the handle. This is where you \"load\" the gun.\" The incision should be roughly 1/4\" deep and 1/2 wide. Place it roughly in the center of the diagonal \"trigger\" of the gun. You may need to cut twice -- once through the barrel and once through the opening underneath.

This little extra notch will help hold the rubber band in place. Make sure there is a deep enough notch to hook a rubber band (bullet) onto. Cut a small notch in the barrel of the gun. This just needs to be big enough to hold a rubber band on the other side. You can then attach the band between this notch and the first one you made. When you pull the \"trigger\" you move the notch enough to release the rubber band, causing it to fire! Finished. ",
