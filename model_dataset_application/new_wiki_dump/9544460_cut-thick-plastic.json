Saw using the full length of the blade, and move the saw in smooth, quick back-and-forth motions through the material you\u2019re cutting. Using a saw with fine, small teeth will allow you to cut through thick plastic precisely and without destroying the plastic itself. While all saws will be able to cut through plastic, saws with large teeth will leave the plastic torn or shredded. Some of these fine-toothed saws look like a knife or straight-razor and can easily be used with one hand. A selection of fine-toothed saws may be available for purchase at hobby stores, since they\u2019re commonly used to cut plastic models and die-cast figurines."

          "description":"When cutting with a jigsaw, hold the object you\u2019re sawing firmly, or use a C-clamp to hold it on a table. Squeeze the trigger, so the blade is moving before you touch it to the plastic. Hold the saw\u2019s handle steady, and use firm pressure to press the blade through your plastic. A jigsaw will work best if you\u2019re cutting heavy-duty plastic, including PVC pipe. The blade of a jigsaw is about 8 inches (20 cm) long, so won\u2019t lend itself to detailed cutting (for example, if you want to cut out a small circle of plastic). You can purchase jigsaws and other fine-toothed saws at your local hardware store."

          "description":"Start the table saw running, and set the plastic you want to cut on the flat surface of the saw table. Hold the plastic by its sides, and slowly push it forward until it engages the blade. Continue to push the plastic forward in a slow, steady motion, until the blade has cut through the entire plastic object. If you\u2019re cutting through thick plastic with a table saw, the heated saw blade may melt the plastic. Avoid this by cutting through heavy-duty plastic with a non-melt blade, which will not heat up enough to melt the plastic material. These blades will have evenly-spaced teeth which are set close together. Non-melt table saw blades should be available for purchase at a nearby hardware store."

If you\u2019d like to cut through very large sections of plastic, you can do so by drilling small holes throughout its surface. This method could even work when cutting heavy PVC pipe. The process will be painstaking and time consuming, but it will allow you to cut precisely."
