      "description":"Remember to count each couple or family as one invitation so that you don't over order. It's up to you whether to make wedding invitations or wedding announcements, or a combination of the two. If you're just announcing the wedding, expect to send 300-600 announcements. Brides who make invitations average under 100 invitations. Remember not to cut the number to save money--realize that (and your mom is too polite to say this aloud) every $1.00 invitation you send will bring back $50 in gifts. But remember to keep in mind the cost per-head at the reception if you expect them to come."

If you have your heart set on a particular \u201cfrilly\" font, consider using a combination of fonts, with your names in a larger, more elaborate font and the rest of the text in a simpler, smaller font. When choosing a font, be sure to look at the first initials of your names in the font you are considering. If you like your first initial in a font, you're likely to like the invitation when it's finished. Unless you have a degree in art, don't try to pick a font or layout an announcement yourself."

Web sites are better than multiple enclosures, and appease those who hate registry cards. You can print on a pew card and it will look a lot better than \u201cAimee and John are registered at Classy Joint We Really Hate.
