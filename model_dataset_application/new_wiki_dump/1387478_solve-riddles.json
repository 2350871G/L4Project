          "description":"There are two basic types of riddles: enigmas and conundrums. Both are often framed as a dialogue between the riddle asker (often the riddle\u2019s solution) and the riddle answerer. Enigmas are posed as problems using metaphorical, allegorical, or associational language that require creativity and experience to answer. For example: \u201cIf the sun sets, a flower-garden; but if you look at it after dawn, an empty garden. What is it?\u201d (Answer: the sky.) Conundrums are posed as questions that incorporate puns in the question, the answer, or both. For example: \u201cWhat flowers can be found between the nose and chin?\u201d (Answer: Tulips/\u201dTwo lips\u201d)"

          "description":"Most riddles deal with very familiar topics. Their difficulty comes in how those topics are described. Riddles often create a pattern of associations in order to direct you to the answer. For example, a popular riddle from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s The Hobbit goes: \u201cThirty white horses on a red hill, / First they champ, / Then they stamp, / Then they stand still.\u201d This riddle uses familiar ideas (horses, hills) to figuratively express the answer (in this case, \u201cteeth.\u201d)"

          "headline":"Know that riddles may try to trick you.",
          "description":"Seemingly logical associations may really be misdirection. The correct answer may be so obvious that you initially dismiss it. Red herrings are a common form of misdirection through association, as seen in this riddle: \u201cA green man lives in the green house. A blue man lives in the blue house. A red man lives in the red house. Who lives in the white house?\u201d The immediate answer, given the pattern set up, would be \u201ca white man,\u201d but the \u201cWhite House\u201d is a red herring: the President of the United States lives in the White House! A traditional African riddle asks: \u201cHow do you eat an elephant?\u201d (Answer: one bite at a time.) This riddle is a good example of an answer being hidden in plain sight. Other \u201criddles\u201d are not true riddles at all. For example, this traditional Yiddish riddle asks: \u201cWhat hangs on a wall, is green, wet, and whistles?\u201d The answer is \u201ca herring\u201d because you can hang a herring on a wall and paint a herring green. If the herring has been freshly painted, it is wet. The joke is that it really doesn\u2019t whistle -- there\u2019s intentionally no solution to this riddle."

          "description":"Solving puzzles requires you to combine what you already know with new information from the puzzle. Just like riddles, puzzles ask you to use existing knowledge and context clues to come up with an original, often tricky answer. Puzzles can help you learn to recognize patterns and order. Puzzle games such as Tetris, as well as traditional jigsaw puzzles, require you to look at a situation in multiple ways to figure out the best solution. This process transfers well into solving riddles, too. Specific types of puzzles and games are best at developing specific types of skills. Thus, if you do a lot of crossword puzzles, you\u2019ll probably get very good at crossword puzzles, but you may not see equivalent gains in other areas. It\u2019s helpful to play a variety of games instead of focusing on only one type."

Research suggests that this will help you look at the \u201cbig picture\u201d as well as the details, a skill that also comes in handy when solving riddles. Rephrasing ideas into your own words may also help you develop linguistic flexibility and improve memory. It\u2019s easier to remember ideas when you\u2019ve taken the time to paraphrase them, because your brain has had to work to structure the ideas so that it understands them."

Although the wording itself may be tricky, the solution is usually something familiar. For example, a famous enigma in Sophocles\u2019 play Oedipus the King asks, \u201cWhat goes on four feet in the morning, two feet at noon, and three feet in the evening?\u201d The answer is \u201ca person\u201d: a baby crawls when it is young (morning), walks upright when it is an adult (noon), and has to use a cane when it is old (evening)."

What has three feet? What has four feet? Many animals have four feet, so that\u2019s a possible answer. Tables and chairs also have four feet, and they\u2019re common things too, so keep those in mind. What has two feet? People seem an obvious choice here, since humans are familiar and they have two feet. Chairs and tables don\u2019t have two feet, so they\u2019re probably not the answer. What has three feet? This is the tricky part. Animals don\u2019t usually have three feet unless one has been taken away. However, if the animal started with four feet and then went to two feet, it wouldn\u2019t re-grow a third foot. That means that we\u2019re probably looking at the third foot as a kind of tool: something that has been added. What uses tools? A person is the most familiar answer, so this might be the target."

The riddle gives you \u201cmorning,\u201d \u201cnoon,\u201d and \u201cevening\u201d as the times when the actions happen. Because the riddle begins in the morning and ends in the evening, it seems likely that the riddle is asking about something that happens across the progress of time from beginning to end. Be careful to avoid over-literal thinking when considering riddles. They are almost always figurative; \u201cnoon\u201d might not mean \u201c12:00 PM\u201d so much as the \u201cmiddle\u201d of something."

That makes them unlikely solutions. A person has multiple feet, they can \u201cadd\u201d more feet by using tools like canes and crutches, and they can \u201cgo\u201d somewhere on their feet. Even if you don\u2019t quite know how the feet work together with time yet, \u201cperson\u201d seems like a solid solution."
