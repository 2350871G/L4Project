Continue to shake the bag until all of the onions have a nice coating of the cornstarch-flour mixture. Once they are covered, remove them from the bag and place them aside. You can also purchase pre-made crispy onions at the store. The rest of your cornstarch will be used to thicken your casserole."

          "description":"Fill a deep skillet or pan with 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) of vegetable oil. Heat your oil over medium-high heat until the oil is hot. Use a slotted spoon to lower your coated onions into the oil. The onions should sizzle when the oil is hot enough. Do this in a couple of batches until you've fried all of the onions. Once a batch of onions is brown and crispy, remove the onions from the oil and place them on a paper towel lined plate. If your oil is smoking, it is burning."
