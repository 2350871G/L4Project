          "description":"The easiest way to see where to distress your jeans is to try them on. Jeans fit everyone differently, so there is no precise rule of thumb regarding where, say, your knees will fall in the jeans. Try your jeans on and mark the areas where you want holes using a pen, marker, or piece of chalk. Jeans are commonly distressed at the knees, back pockets, upper thighs, or at the sides. Mark which area you want to distress. For example, if you're distressing your upper thigh, think about where you would want the rips to show when wearing your jeans. If you've never distressed jeans before, it is not advised that you distress the sides. Side seams are necessary to hold the jeans together so these areas can rip easily. If you do distress along the sides, only make a few tears. If you plan on distressing your back pocket, it is probably not necessary to try the jeans on first."

You will not be able to remove all the colored portions of the thread. There may be some fuzz leftover around the edges of holes when you're done as well.
