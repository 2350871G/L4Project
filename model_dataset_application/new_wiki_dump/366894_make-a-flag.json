Fold the edge of the material loosely over the handle and pin the material in place. Remove the handle, then you can use a sewing machine or some fabric glue to secure the material in place. Sew or glue the top of the pocket together, so the handle cannot slip through. This will allow the flag to sit on top of the handle."

If you are making an American flag, for example, you would need to cut a small rectangle from a piece of blue fabric, seven long stripes of equal width from some red fabric, and a collection of five-pointed stars from a piece of white fabric.
