You can remove a few weeds by hand if necessary, but don\u2019t choose a location that\u2019s overrun with them. Strawberries can also be grown in raised garden beds if you prefer. When preparing a raised bed for strawberries (instead of the garden), the difference is that you only have to till the soil to the depth of the bed."

With a hoe or tiller, go over the entire garden bed and dig the soil to a depth of 12 inches (30 cm) to loosen it up. Don\u2019t worry if the soil still seems a little hard-packed, as you're going to till it again when you amend it with compost."

You can add nutrients and some acidity to the soil by working in organic matter. Spread about 4 inches (10 cm) of organic matter on top of the bed, and use the hoe or tiller to work it thoroughly into the soil. Good organic matter for strawberries includes mature compost, aged manure, and peat moss. To test the pH of your soil, use a soil test kit, which you can purchase at hardware and garden stores."

To achieve this, spread 2 inches (5.1 cm) of pearlite or vermiculite on top of the bed and work it into the soil with the hoe or tiller. Pearlite and vermiculite both retain water, so they allow water to drain through the soil while also keeping it moist."

Use a rake to spread out the fertilizer, work it into the top layer of soil, and even out the garden bed. The best fertilizer for strawberries is a balanced one that contains equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, such as a 5-5-5. You can also buy fertilizers that are specifically formulated for strawberries and other fruiting plants."
