While some plants need to be fertilized before and after the growing season, you should consider only fertilizing your daffodils at the beginning of the growing season and then laying down mulch at the end of the season.

However you can fertilize them after if you hope to have blooms the following year. Keep in mind that container-planted daffodils generally do not grow as well the second year that they remain in the container. However, if you want to keep them for a second season, fertilize after the growing season to improve their performance the next season. After flowering ends, top dress your container with a slow-release fertilizer such as bone meal (this is pretty stinky so you may not want to keep it in the house!) or a granular fertilizer. About two months after the flowers fade, turn the container on its side for about three months and avoid watering it until the fall."
