Use a soft sponge with warm water - don't use any industrial detergents as these can also introduce film coatings that may also affect the welding results. Clean all the  painted surfaces right back to the parent material. Paints and other remaining soils should be removed easily using a standard abrasive wheel (sanding disc) with any high speed air drill or electric drill will do the trick. A grinding disc will make quick work of this process, but be warned - plastics yield easily to abrasives, so take care you don't end up damaging other sections of the part where the wheel can 'catch' and 'drag' across the component."
