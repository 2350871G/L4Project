Swap 1 villager for an additional werewolf for games of 16 or more players.Tip: If you don\u2019t have the Werewolf deck, you can use scraps of paper to play the game.

The Drunk behaves like a regular villager throughout the game, but they can only communicate with gestures or noises. If they talk at all, they automatically die. Other characters, like the werewolves, can pretend to be the Drunk as a strategy. The Witch also behaves like a villager throughout the game, except they have the ability to use 1 healing potion and 1 poison at any point during the game. When the Witch is added, the moderator will wake them up separately during the night round and allow them to poison or bring 1 player back to life. The Alpha Werewolf behaves like a normal werewolf, but they must say the word \u201cWerewolf\u201d at least 1 time during the day round. This will become difficult because other players may actively avoid saying the word in order to identify the Alpha Werewolf.
