      "description":"Take measurements of all the windows that you will cover with vinyl blinds. Use a tape measure to get the length of the window. Start at the top of the window, and pull the tape measure down to the bottom of the window. Use a tape measure to get the width of the window. Start at the left of the window and pull the tape measure to the right until you get to the end of the window."

      "headline":"Decide if vertical or horizontal blinds will work best.",
      "description":"Choose vertical blinds if you are covering a long window or a sliding door. Vertical blinds also work well in offices. Select horizontal blinds for a softer, more modern look. Vinyl blinds that hang horizontally are used most often on windows in homes."

      "headline":"Consider your slat width.",
      "description":"Most horizontal vinyl blinds come with slats that are half an inch (1.27 cm) or 2 inches (5 cm). Buy blinds with a larger slat width for extra privacy and to keep the sun out. Look for a smaller slat size for more texture and style."
