When drilling a hole into any material, make sure that the bit is exactly perpendicular to the surface that you want to drill into. Slowly squeeze the trigger, and press the drill lightly so the bit sinks down into the material you\u2019re drilling."

If you\u2019d like to limit the depth of the hole, use the \u201creverse\u201d button to help you draw the drill back out of the material you\u2019re drilling into. Once you\u2019ve drilled deep enough, reverse the drill and spin the bit backwards to help you withdraw the bit from the hole. If you only need to drill a specific depth, place a strip of electrical tape around the bit at that depth. The tape will prevent you from accidentally drilling too deep."

Drill the pilot hole with a drill bit sized slightly smaller than the screw, so that the screw won\u2019t be loose in the hole. To find the correct drill bit size, hold the drill bit in front of the screw. The bit should cover the body of the screw, but the threading should be visible above and below the drill bit."
