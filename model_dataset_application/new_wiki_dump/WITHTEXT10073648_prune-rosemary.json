          "description":"The best time to prune rosemary is between March and June, when the warm weather and plentiful sunshine will help produce healthy new foliage. However, you can also begin as early as the last weeks of winter, or hold off until things start cooling off in the fall. A good rule of thumb is to schedule your last trim of the season no later than 4-6 weeks before the earliest expected frost. This will give the new growth a chance to harden off before the temperature outside plummets. Get in the habit of pruning your rosemary around the same time every year. Regular attention will allow it to flourish."

The sharper the blades, the cleaner the cut, and the stronger the branches will grow back as a result. Bypass pruners, which feature overlapping blades that move past one another as they close, tend to make cleaner cuts than traditional scissor-style shears. The ragged cuts created by dull blades could leave your rosemary vulnerable to pests or infectious diseases."

Focus on flowers that show signs of damage or are beginning to lose their color. Leave healthy blooms intact. Mature rosemary shrubs put out delicate blue, pink, purple, or white blossoms which give them aesthetic as well as culinary value. Rosemary flowers are actually edible, so consider saving a few of the blooms that appear to be in better shape."

Do the same for low-lying branches that show signs of fungal infection, such as drooping or discolored foliage. If the entire branch or stem appears to be affected, it's usually best to get rid of the whole thing to keep the condition from spreading. Spreading 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of sand or pea gravel over the base of your rosemary plant can go a long way in preventing fungal diseases by helping the growing soil dry out faster."
