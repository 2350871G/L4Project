          "description":"Your face is the first giveaway that could cost you a game of poker. Keeping your emotions and reactions in check regarding hands dealt to you is a key part of poker. Any type of expression sacrifices your power in situations with your opponents. Clear your mind, wiggle your face to loosen the muscles, take a deep breath, and relax. You want to be in control of the situation and if you\u2019re too stressed, you can lose that control. Hiding your reactions is power because no one knows what you\u2019re thinking or what you\u2019re about to do."

Meeting people\u2019s eyes also shows that you have nothing to hide so they don\u2019t know what to expect from you. Look at the bridge of their nose to stare them down and keep your focus."

          "headline":"Blink occasionally to avoid staring.",
          "description":"Staring into space or focusing too hard on your cards is also how your poker face can be compromised. It either shows that you aren\u2019t paying attention, or that you\u2019re concerned for your hand and chances. Remind yourself to blink so that your eyes don\u2019t dry out while you concentrate. Excessive blinking can also show nervousness, so don\u2019t go overboard. There\u2019s a balance between blinking enough to keep from staring and keeping your eyes focused so they don\u2019t flit around. Staring too hard can also cause your shoulders to bunch up and posture to suffer. Focusing too hard on one thing visually can also distract you and you may miss an important play."

Relax your jaw first by letting it go slack, creating space between your back teeth. Open and close your mouth a few times to help relax as well. Avoid showing your teeth. Whether it\u2019s for a small grin or grimace, visible teeth means your mouth is moving and movement can give you away. Don\u2019t grind your teeth. Your jaw will show the pressure your teeth are under."

These are all tells which are little clues to your opponents that you have something to hide, whether it\u2019s a good hand of cards or bad. It\u2019s hard to do, but minimize your eye movements.

For example, hold your fist under the table or press your knees together to redirect any tension to where no one can notice it.

Short, sweet, and to the point is how you should talk when in high-stress situations. One-word answers are acceptable, especially in high-stakes games like poker. You need to concentrate more on the game anyways rather than shooting the breeze with your opponents.
