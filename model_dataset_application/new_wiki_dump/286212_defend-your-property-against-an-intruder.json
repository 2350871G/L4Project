Pepper spray is usually available at sporting goods stores, online, and through pharmacies. Each state will have different laws regarding the purchase and use of this tool so make sure you know how to use it legally. For example, in California, canisters can only be a certain size and can only contain a certain level of the active ingredient \"OC.\" In New York, you can only purchase pepper spray from a licensed pharmacist. To use pepper spray, grasp the canister in your hand and use your thumb to press down the trigger. Point the canister in the direction of the intruder and squeeze the trigger when the intruder gets within two arm lengths of you. Aim the stream at the eyes of the intruder. Once the intruder has been hit with the spray, step aside but do not turn your back on the intruder. Continue spraying until there is a safe opportunity to run away. Make sure you practice using the pepper spray so you feel comfortable with it. This will make using it easier when you are faced with an intrusion. Don't touch your face with the hand used to deploy the pepper spray, as some may get on your hands. Try to hold your breath when you spray so you don't inhale any of the pepper spray."

Tasers are not allowed to be used in a number of states including Hawaii, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Check with your state laws before you purchase and/or use a taser to protect your property. Other states limit the use of tasers to homes and to people with valid permits.

Make sure you have the time and dedication necessary to train a dog properly. Simply making your dog aggressive is not safe for you or good for the dog. Keep in mind this is a guard dog, not an attack dog. An attack dog, like dogs used by police, requires a great deal of training and is likely not appropriate to keep in a home. If you do not have the funds to hire a professional trainer, you can certainly work to train the dog yourself. Start by teaching the dog basic obedience (i.e., sit, stay, leave it, and bark). Next, teach your dog impulse control, which means obeying your commands when others are in the house. You also need to teach the dog about their territory, which involves walking the dog around the house and your property daily. Finally, teach the dog to protect your property by going through the process with them. Have someone come up to your house as if they were going to break in. Teach your dog how to react to these situations and repeat the process."
