          "description":"Before you start to look at paint chips, envision how you want your house to look. Do you want to freshen up a dingy paint job? Add a bright color to liven up your space? Or restore a house\u2019s historical significance? Considering how you want to upgrade your house can help choose your paint colors. For instance, if you are revitalizing an old colonial home, go with a classic color palette, like beige, brick-red, and cream. If you want to modernize your home, consider going with a bold color like red or navy. For a modern style, consider slate-gray, white, or charcoal shades. If you want a quaint, inviting style, go with warm colors and earth tones, such as rust, terracotta, or forest green."

          "description":"Rather than picking multiple colors for your siding, pick 1 hue in an attractive shade you enjoy. This way, your house looks polished and neat rather than over-the-top. For example, you can choose a light cream shade if you want a classic house color. Consider picking a light yellow or blue if you want a bit of color."

          "headline":"Choose 1-2 accenting colors for your shutters, door, and trim.",
          "description":"In addition to your siding color, you can also choose a couple colors to use to accent the outside of your house. Use 1 color for your shutters, door, and trim for a uniform look, or pick a different color for both your shutters and the door to liven up your space. This adds subtle pops of color, which makes your house look streamlined and unique. For example, if you want a classic, timeless look, paint your house light cream and go with a navy blue shutter and door color. If you want a personalized look, consider painting the house light yellow, selecting forest green shutters, and coloring the door a bright burgundy hue."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Go with colors that complement the environment around your home.",
          "description":"Your landscape and environment can make a difference when choosing your paint shades. Your paint shades will depend on your particular environment. Choose similar shades if you want your home to blend in or choose contrasting colors for a dramatic effect. For example, if your home is situated in a forest, go with earth tones in a similar color palette to the leaves and trees if you want your home to blend in. If you want some contrast, you can choose earth tones in a lighter shade, or try blues or yellows instead. If you live in the desert, you can choose warm earth tones such as reds and oranges. If your house is along the water, choose varying shades of blue, such as sky blue, royal blue, and navy. For a contrasting shade, go with a light yellow or green instead. Keep in mind that neutral colors are always a good choice. If you aren't sure of what color looks best for your environment, choose a neutral shade in a similar tone as your environment. Go with a beige, grey, or brown."

        {
          "headline":"Factor in how much natural light your house gets when choosing colors.",
          "description":"The color of paint you choose will look slightly different depending on your location. Think about how much light reaches the exterior of your home and consider any artificial lamps or light posts nearby. This can be helpful when selecting particular shades of paint. If you live in a house near a lot of trees, the color may look darker once painted on your house. You may want to choose a lighter shade to offset and shadows. If you live in a well-lit development, artificial light may make the color look brighter, for example. It may be helpful to select a darker shade to balance the overall look."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Avoid picking a similar house color as your neighbors.",
          "description":"If your next-door neighbor has a brown home with light blue shutters, avoid choosing these colors to decorate the outside of your home. Your neighbors may think you are copying them, and your house will not look unique. Instead, choose colors that your current neighbors are not using. This mainly applies if you live in a large neighborhood or community. If you live in a secluded area, this does not matter as much."

These colors are, for the most part, universally attractive, so you won\u2019t have any issues selling your home when the time comes. Some buyers may not gravitate towards a bright blue or purple home. For instance, go with a beige house and white accents for a classic look."

For instance, paint the outside of your home slate-blue, and color your shutters with a light yellow paint. Then, go with a burnt-red door for a subtle color option. The bright, true hues can look a bit too elementary if used for your entire exterior."

You can paint all of the exterior the same color, or go with subtle variations of the same hue. This creates a uniform, neat appearance. For example, paint all of your house a white color if you want a very clean-looking exterior. You can also choose an off-white base color, vanilla shutters, and a light beige door to slightly vary the hues."

Go with a cypress green, lighthouse red, or brilliant yellow for more traditional colors. Choose turquoise, fuschia, or plum for unique house color options. Using bright colors to paint your home can add a cheery, joyful touch to your environment."

This is a great way to freshen up an old house, for instance. For example, choose a neutral color like beige, and go with a light green and turquoise accents for a tropical style. You can also go with a gray house color and paint your shutters bright red for an attractive option. Use the same color to paint your door, or go with a burnt-sienna instead."
