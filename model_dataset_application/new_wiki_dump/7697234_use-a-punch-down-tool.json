The angled (cut) part of the blade should come into contact with the shoulder (the long sturdy side of the jack). This will also make sure the wires that are cut are flush with the jack. Be sure to punch straight down and not at an angle. This will prevent the jack from bending. You should hear a loud click when you punch down.

You should also make sure that the edge of the cable jacket is near the base of the jack and the wires you just terminated. The wires should be securely in place. If you notice wires sticking out the side, take a wire cutter and carefully trim the wire so that it's flush with the jack."

You can easily remove the dust cap if you need to make changes to wiring later. Simply pop off the dust cap using a flat-head screwdriver inserted into the indentation on the side. If you can't set the dust caps back on the jack, your wires may not be seated correctly. Check the wires again to make sure they are secure and trimmed."
