Coat the pork loin with flour, dip (don't drown) it into the bowl of the beaten egg, and then lay each side of the loin onto a tray of panko flakes. Move the loin into another skillet with vegetable oil at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Make sure the oil fizzles as the loin drops in. Fry each side until they're both golden brown."
