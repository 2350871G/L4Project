          "description":"Use a pen or pencil to trace a circle around the button that's roughly 1 centimetre (0.39 in) past the edge of the button. This extra space ensures the sides of the button will be covered too. This circle will be where you cut.Don't just trace the edges of the button, as this won't leave you enough space to wrap the fabric around the edges of the button. If you're not sure how much space to leave between the button and your drawn circle, measure the diameter of the button. This is the correct amount of space to leave between the button's edge and your pen or pencil markings."

Covering a Button Shell Place the silicone button mold from the kit onto a flat surface. If your button kit comes with a silicone mold to help you cover the button, place this on a flat surface with the hollow end facing upwards.

Folding Fabric over Button Teeth Place the button with the teeth side up on your fabric circle. Set the fabric on a flat surface with the patterned side facing down. If you\u2019re using a button that has teeth that hold the fabric in place, place the button in the center of your fabric circle with the teeth facing upwards towards you.The teeth are there to hold the fabric in place when you fold it over the button\u2019s edges.

It\u2019s best to place the fabric down on a surface that you\u2019re able to sew on top of easily. Set down the circle with the patterned side facing the surface so you\u2019re looking at the back side of the fabric. Use a needle and thread to create stitches along the edge of the fabric.
