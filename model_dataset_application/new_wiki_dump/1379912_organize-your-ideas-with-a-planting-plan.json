If you are able to buy large trees and shrubs you will be able to have an instant garden; if you can\u2019t afford them then you will need patience to grow young plants. For instance, Perennials can bloom and reach their maximum height in the first couple of years, so don\u2019t spend money on big plants. Besides, it will be very interesting to see them grow as time goes by. Organize your plants. Many people get excited and try to cram too much into a small space, but overcrowded plants tend to be unhealthy, so always think about what their final spreads will be when drawing up your plan. The best way to make your plants look fuller is to put them all in a group together. Decide which shape to use to group the plants. If you group plants in the shape of a sausage (which works well for cottage and prairie styles), or in triangle shapes they will look better and you will be able to create harmony among disparate groups. Visualize your Ideas You should try to visualize a planting plan. If you are doing a small garden you can sketch the view from an upstairs\u2019 window. Feel free to let your imagination run wild and don\u2019t worry too much about being accurate at this stage. Look at all the views from the house at ground level and think if you want your plants to frame, enhance, or block them.  Scope out the field, decide where the plants are going to be. You can place these on your drawing as simple shapes. You should also take photographs as well, that way you can refer to them when you draw your plan. If you already have a pretty good idea of what you want, you can sketch your ideas directly onto the photographs; if not; work on a sheet of tracing paper laid on top. These rough sketches will help to prepare a more organized planting plan. The Last Draft Of Your Planting Plan If you are preparing a plan for your own use you will not need fancy graphics:  On the last draft of your plan, map out the sections that you would like to plant, and then add the plants you want.  Sketch circles to scale. This will help you decide where trees, plants or shrubs will be. Mark out a square meter on the ground and calculate plant spacing for different species using their final spreads. Make a note of them for future reference. This will let you see how dense your planting will be. Design your plan on graph paper. When choosing the scale, take into account how big the beds or borders are going to be. A scale of 1:50 or 1:20 is appropriate for an intricate plan. Make sure you trace your drawing to develop a nice, complete design. Make two versions: a drawing to keep for yourself and the other version that you can use when you are going to plant. It would be nice if you laminate your last draft to protect it from the weather.",
