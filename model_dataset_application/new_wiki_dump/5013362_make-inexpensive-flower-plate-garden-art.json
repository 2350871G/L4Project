Aim to get 3 plates, one of each that is small, medium and large. These will need to fit together so that all 3 are visible, so each needs to be slightly larger than the next. A mix of solid-color and patterned plates works well. Don't limit yourself to just plates \u2013 pretty pot lids, teacups, small vases, votive candle holders, or glass lampshades can also work nicely. Transparent glass plates work well, and ones with textured edges. You don\u2019t have to use china or glass. Consider using metal or plastic plates, lids, or colanders. You can always try customizing your plates by painting them with glass paints or gluing on marbles and glass beads to add extra color and texture."

Remember that this stem will be driven into the ground, so make sure it\u2019s at least 1/3 of it can sink into the ground while still maintaining your desired flower head height. The deeper you can drive it into the ground, the more secure and stable it will be."

The following methods require different materials, so pay close attention to the materials used. Depending on how you plan to assemble your plate art, you\u2019ll also need glue, or a drill and drill bits and a way to stabilize the plates while drilling them."
