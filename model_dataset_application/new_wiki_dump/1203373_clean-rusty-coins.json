Avoid cleaning corrosion (such as rust), buildup (such as dirt), and other filth from old coins if you are hoping to sell them for prices anywhere near coin-collecting book values. If the coins you want to clean are part of a numismatic (serious study of coins) collection, do not clean them. Doing so can greatly diminish their coin-collecting values.

In terms of American currency: clean pennies separately from nickles, dimes, quarters, etc. Do not leave copper pennies to soak with steel pennies. The copper could react with the cleaning chemicals and somewhat dissolve in the solution. The dissolved copper will bind to the steel pennies, ruining their finishes."

It is also well suited to silver coins, and it is used by German silversmiths to clean silver jewelry.
