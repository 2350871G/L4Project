A side of citrus wouldn't go amiss, either, as the vitamin C may help your body rid itself of caffeine. For instance, try a couple of hard-boiled eggs with whole wheat toast and a small orange.

Go for a run, take a walk, or even jump in the pool. Just take a few minutes to burn off some of the extra boost your caffeine is giving you. While this method isn't tried-and-true, some people have good luck with it."

Mediation, yoga, and deep breathing techniques are a good way calm yourself down. For a simple deep breathing technique, start by closing your eyes. Breathe in through your nose to the count of 4, then hold it for 4 counts. Breathe out to the count of 4 and hold it for 4 beats before inhaling again.

Take a single pill or stir in the powder with your coffee or tea, as it dissolves well in liquid. You can find this supplement online or in health food stores.

That natural boost should hold you for at least an hour or so, when you may start flagging. At that point, have your caffeine to increase alertness.

If you can get out of the habit or are already out of the habit of drinking it every day, try a boost before big events and avoiding it at other times. Taking it only when you need it helps you moderate your intake. If you only use a little every so often, you're less likely to become dependent, making you want more and more each time you have it.

Many coffee mugs hold more than that amount, so try not to underestimate how much you're drinking. Even if you're just drinking it in the morning, having 6 to 8 cups (1,400 to 1,900 mL) of coffee could still affect your sleep, since your body takes longer to get rid of higher doses of caffeine. Caffeine has a half-life of 6 hours, meaning that at 6 hours, your body has half the caffeine in it you started with, and every 6 hours, you cut it in half again. If you start with you 800 milligrams at 9 a.m., you still have 400 milligrams in your body at 3 p.m. and 200 milligrams in your body at 9 p.m."

Check how much calcium you're consuming in your diet and through supplements if you're drinking 3 cups of coffee a day or more. Up your intake to at least 800 milligrams to decrease bone loss. Dairy foods and greens are both good sources of calcium. Even non-dairy milk is often fortified with calcium. It doesn't take much to increase your calcium. For instance, 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of milk has 300 milligrams of calcium. Other foods have calcium, too: 8 ounces (230 g) of frozen collard greens has 360 milligrams of calcium, while a 3 oz (85 g) serving of salmon has 160 milligrams. Even an orange has 60 milligrams.

Caffeine doesn't affect every person's blood pressure, but if you are worried about yours, taking this step may help. Exercising increases your blood pressure, so if you combine that with drinking caffeine right before, you can increase it too much. If you're not sure how caffeine affects your blood pressure, do a test. Take your blood pressure, then drink a cup of coffee. After about 30 minutes (and before 2 hours is up), take your blood pressure again. If it's increased by 5-10 points, caffeine could be affecting your blood pressure."
