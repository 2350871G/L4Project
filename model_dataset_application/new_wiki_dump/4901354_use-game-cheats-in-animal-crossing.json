This takes you to a text screen where you input codes to your fancy! Repeat this process for every code that you have/want. Again, many codes can be found online. A sample code for the Golden Axe is as follows: 4B2&p%eGcglO7NHZCS3hjkKJtlgH - the Golden Axe never breaks, making it a great advantage to have if you\u2019re interested in changing up the landscape of your town. As you can see, the code is a bit difficult, so it will require careful entry. If you make a mistake, an error will come back saying that no item was obtained."

So if, for example, you use the codes for the golden shovel, golden axe, and golden bug net, that is all you will be able to get that day.

For example, if you don\u2019t want to invest a lot of time in farming bells, then go ahead and use the code for 30,000 bells until you have as much money as you want (but remember that you can only redeem 3 codes per 24 hours). If you want those golden tools early on in the game to make things easier, go ahead and grab those.
