  "text":" Making Stuffed Toast with Jam and Cream Cheese Select and slice bread. Use homemade bread, if possible, such as white bread, braided challah bread, or French bread. Slice the bread into six slices, about 1.5 in (3.8 cm) thick. Use a paring knife to cut a horizontal pocket into each slice of bread, taking care not to cut completely through the slice. Combine the filling ingredients in a sealable bag or piping bag. Use homemade jam, if possible. Mix the jam and softened cream cheese together. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag or a sealable plastic bag. Use any jam or marmalade you like, such as blueberry, orange, or mixed berry. Stuff the bread with filling. Snip off a bottom corner of your sealable bag, if applicable. Squeeze the piping bag to fill the pocket of one slice of bread. Press down around the edges of the bread to secure the sandwich. Use about 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of filling for each sandwich. Repeat this process for each sandwich. Dip the bread in the egg mixture. In a bowl, whisk together a batter of eggs, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla, if desired. Coat the bread on both sides. Cook each pocket for about four minutes on each side. Place the butter in a large skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Cook one side of the pocket until it is golden brown, then flip the bread with a spatula and cook the other side equally. Dress and serve the bread. You can top the pockets with sprinkled powder sugar, warmed-up jam, or syrup. Try adding a side, like breakfast meat or fresh fruit. Making Stuffed Toast with Banana and Nut Butter Slice the bread thickly. Use bread such as oat nut or whole grain \u2013 homemade, if possible. Cut one 3 in (7.6 cm) slice for each sandwich, using a bread knife. Then cut halfway down the center of each 3 in (7.6 cm) piece. Create \u201cpockets\u201d in the bread. Place the tip of a paring knife into the slice you just made. Angle the knife downward and carve out a pocket, without cutting completely through the bread. Repeat this process for each sandwich. Stuff the bread. Spoon one tablespoon (12 g) of peanut butter, almond butter or other nut butter into each sandwich. Arrange a few banana slices inside each pocket. Create the batter. Use a container, such as a large bowl, that is big enough to soak one sandwich. In the container, whisk together almond milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon and salt. Dunk the pieces in the batter. Place each sandwich, one at a time, into the container of batter. Allow each sandwich to soak for ten seconds. Cook the bread. Pre-heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add a thin coating of coconut oil to the skillet. Cook the bread until it\u2019s golden brown on one side, about four to five minutes. Flip the bread with a spatula and cook the other side equally. Cooking French Toast Rollups Slice and flatten bread. Use home-style white bread \u2013 homemade, if possible. Remove any crusts from the bread. Flatten each slice of bread with a rolling pin. Mix the filling ingredients together. In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, chocolate chips, powdered sugar, and orange zest. Fill and roll each bread slice. Spread a tablespoon of filling over each slice of bread. Stop 1/2 in (1.3 cm) from the edge and 1 in (2.5 cm) from the top. Roll the slice from the bottom to the top. Preheat a skillet while you prepare the batter. Place a skillet over medium heat. Melt a tablespoon of butter until it\u2019s sizzling. In a shallow bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, and cinnamon. Dip and cook each bread roll. Cook each coated bread roll, turning it occasionally, until all sides are lightly browned \u2013 about three minutes. Wipe the skillet carefully with a damp cloth or paper towel in between each batch. Use a tablespoon (15 g) of butter for each batch. Serve the rollups. Sprinkle the tops of the rollups with powdered sugar, if desired. Add fresh fruit, such as strawberries or cherries, to each plate.",
