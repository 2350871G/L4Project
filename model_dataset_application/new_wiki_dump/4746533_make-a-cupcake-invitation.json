Draw a large semi circle for the frosting top. This should be slightly wider each side than the trapezoid base. A suggested measurement is: 11cm/4.3 inches at its widest and up to5cm/2.5\" height. At the base of the circle, draw a wavy line with two inward waves, to form the \"drips\" that frosting develops. Draw a small circle. This will the cherry for the top of the cake."
