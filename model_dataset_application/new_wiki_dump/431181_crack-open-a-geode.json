Then continue forward from this line and repeat the process until you\u2019ve tapped a line all around the geode\u2019s circumference. Begin by tapping very lightly. It will take several passes around the geode to crack it open, so gradually make your taps stronger. Only use a flat-blade chisel for this method. A sharp tool like a screwdriver or ice pick will just punch a hole in the geode without cracking it in half."

With enough repetition, the geode will crack along this line. This method takes some time, but it\u2019s the best way to cleanly crack a geode into two halves. Be patient and avoid the temptation to just hit the geode with a hammer after a while. This will just break the geode into pieces and you won't have two clean halves like you wanted."

Quality models are often several hundred dollars. To avoid that price, check if your hardware store rents pipe cutters. You can't tell from the outside if a geode is valuable, because value depends on what type of crystals are on the inside. Even if the crystals are valuable, however, collectors won't offer a good price for a geode that's smashed open. They want a smooth cut.
