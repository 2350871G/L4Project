Look for stalks that reach 1 to 3 feet (0.3 to 0.9 m) high with fern-like blossoms. During the summer, the heads of yarrow will flower into white or yellow blooms. Each yarrow head will have a few clusters of flowers. Yarrow looks similar to Queen Anne's lace, but yarrow flowers don't spread as widely as the flowers of Queen Anne's lace. Yarrow also lacks the center spot that Queen Anne's lace has."
