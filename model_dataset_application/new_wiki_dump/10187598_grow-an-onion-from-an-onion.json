Your onion piece should be about 1 in (2.5 cm) long to grow a healthy onion. If you're growing the onions outside, start your cuttings in early spring. For onions grown indoors, any time of the year is fine. You can use most onion varieties, including grocery store-bought onions, for growing more onions.
