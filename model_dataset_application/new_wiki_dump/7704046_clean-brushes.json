          "description":"Brushes and sponges hold onto a lot of germs. After all, they have a buildup of skin and oil from your face. Your best bet is to clean them weekly, which will help keep the germs off your face, as well as increase the life of your brushes. If you can't manage cleaning them that often, make sure you do the brushes you use near your eyes at least every other week. You definitely do not want germs near your eyes."

          "description":"You can use any gentle soap or a cleaner made specifically for makeup brushes. Another option is dishwashing soap, which works because it helps to degrease the brush. You only need a little bit in the palm of your hand. Mix olive oil into the soap to help hydrate the bristles and keep them from drying out."

Rub it around in the soap to make sure you get the soap all in the bristles, but don't be too rough, as you can cause the brush to lose its shape. Do each brush one at a time and set it aside. You may need to add more soap if you have a lot of brushes. Don't rub the soap and water into the base of the brush head's base or else it will weaken the glue holding it in place."

You can also use a clean towel to help squeegee out the water. Don't rub the brush on the towel, though, just use your fingers to gently wrap the towel around the brush head and squeeze the water out. Lay the clean brush on a towel as you move on to the next one."

Don't let the brush heads dry on a towel, as that can allow too much water to stay in the bristles, causing mildew. Don't hang the brushes vertically since it can cause water to drain into the base that holds the bristles and break the glue."

You'll need to use different solvents for oil-based paints and latex-based paints, for instance. Pick the right solvent, or you'll end up with a mess. Typically, you can use soap and water for latex paints. However, for oil paints, you'll usually need mineral spirits or turpentine, which you can find at a home improvement store. One homemade paint solvent you can try on a variety of paints is water and fabric softener. Mix 0.5 cups (120 mL) of water into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. If you have brushes that have hardened paint on the bristles, you can purchase a solvent that revives the brush after soaking it for 24 hours."

If you need to, don a glove and use your fingers to rub the bristles. For dried paint, let the paintbrush soak in the solvent for 10 minutes. Shake the solvent off over the container. Use a hair comb to help break apart paint stuck in the bristles. Make sure to clean your comb before using it on your head again."

Work the brush for about a minute, then rinse it with cool water. If you need to clean off the bristles with your fingers, be sure to wear a glove. If you're using a natural-bristle brush, make sure not to leave it in the water for more than a minute, as it can absorb water and destroy the bristles.
