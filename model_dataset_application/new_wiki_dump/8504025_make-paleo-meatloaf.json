You can simply leave the spinach sitting on the counter in room-temperature air; it should take about 4\u20136 hours to thaw. If you\u2019re short on time, you can submerge the packet in a bowl of warm water and let the heat from the water thaw the spinach. Alternately, if you plan ahead the night before, you can take the frozen spinach from the freezer and put it in the fridge, where it will thaw overnight."

Stir all of the ingredients well, giving them time to continue to saut\u00e9e in the oil. Once all of the vegetables are well saut\u00e9ed and have become tender, remove the pan from the heat.

When you\u2019re finished mixing the eggs, flour, and ground meat together, there should not be a puddle of liquid egg in the bottom of the bowl, and the flour should be mixed evenly throughout.
