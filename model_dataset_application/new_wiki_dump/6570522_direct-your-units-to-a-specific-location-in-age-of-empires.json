          "description":"Under normal circumstances in Age of Empires, you want your villagers to go where there are resources (i.e., Food, Wood, and Gold) so they can gather them and provide the empire with the means to grow. To do this, left-click the villager to select it. Right-click the resource you want it to gather. For instance, if you want your villager to gather Wood, right-click a tree that is in a considerably well-forested area in order to make sure they gather as much of the resource as possible. If you try to gather from an area that does not have many trees, you will be forced to waste time reallocating the villager to a different forest when it has gathered all it can from that particular area. If you want your villager to gather Food from hunted animals, direct it to an area with many animals by left-clicking the villager and then right-clicking one of the animals. That way they won\u2019t go idle after they have gathered all they can from the first animal. No matter where you are directing the villager, make sure you see red marks flash on the area you clicked, indicating that you have issued the command successfully and that the villager is on their way."
