If your new division does not allow for easy access to each part of the room, you may need to remove one or more items of furniture, or replace them with smaller pieces. Selecting a Divider Use a tall bookcase for functional division. A bookcase reaching above head height effectively divides the room while providing storage or decoration space. Many people use an open-backed bookcase for this purpose, in order to allow light through. Consider curtains or hanging panels if you plan on changing d\u00e9cor regularly.
