A lumberyard may have an area of used pieces of wood or you could use a plank of wood from an old piece of furniture (that you were going to discard) or from a home remodel. Sand the reclaimed wood to remove splinters, old paint or loose wood. Make several passes with the sander until the plank is clean and ready for staining. Apply stain or paint. Allow ample dry time before proceeding to the next coat or step."
