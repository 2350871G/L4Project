Glue the skinny part of another tape near the edge of the wide part of the vertical tape. Glue 1 more tape in the remaining space to create a perfect square.Tip: You could even use several of these shelves as legs for a table to make some extra storage space. When you are finished, each tape will have 1 skinny end stuck to another and 1 wide part stuck to another. Hang up these individual squares on your wall as shelves, or glue several together to create a bigger grid-shaped shelf. If you create a large grid-like shelf, you can set it on the floor instead of hanging it up on a wall."

Stand up tapes on their sides to make the walls and glue the skinny parts of those tapes to the flat surface of the base you made. For example, to create a small planter, lay 2 tapes flat, side-by-side, and glue them where they touch. Then, glue 4 tapes in a square on top of the base to create the sides. Fill it with dirt and plants and voila!"

For example, to make an \"E,\" glue 2 tapes end-to-end.
