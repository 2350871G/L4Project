You could use cashew, almond, sunflower, or hazelnut butter. Many of these are available in creamy or crunchy varieties. You could use a chocolate-hazelnut or chocolate-cashew spread for an even richer filling."

You can also scatter blueberries, raspberries, or pomegranate seeds for a slightly tangy flavor. For a chewy, sweet taste, you can use dried fruit. Consider using dried apple rings, sliced apricots, dried cranberries, or raisins."

          "headline":"Add something savory.",
          "description":"Most people expect peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to be overly sweet, but they don't have to be. Add a little savory flavor to cut some of the sweetness. Try crumbling bacon over the peanut butter or lay a slice of ham on it. You could also stir a little hot sauce in the peanut butter for a kick of heat. Some stores carry bacon jam which is usually made with bacon and maple syrup. Spread a little of the bacon jam over your fillings."

          "headline":"Use jam instead of the jelly.",
          "description":"If you're not feeling very adventurous about changing the traditional sandwich, just use jam instead of jelly. Unlike jelly, which has the fruit strained out, jam has chunks of the fruit in it. This can also make the fruit flavor stronger. Don't forget to try fruit butters which are creamy and less sweet than jam. For example, you could make a peanut butter and apple butter sandwich."

          "headline":"Try marshmallow fluff instead of jelly.",
          "description":"You can purchase or make marshmallow fluff. Make a fluffernutter sandwich by using peanut butter and marshmallow fluff instead of the jelly. This is a great choice if you don't like the jelly seeping through the bread in traditional peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. For an extra decadent sandwich, you could toast the marshmallow fluff under a broiler before you press the bread together."

        {
          "headline":"Drizzle extra flavor.",
          "description":"You can use peanut butter and jelly as the basic fillings (or just use the peanut butter for a less sweet sandwich) and drizzle a syrup over them. For a robust flavor, drizzle a little molasses over the peanut butter. For a milder flavor, drizzle some honey, golden syrup, or agave syrup over the fillings. If you want to cut some of the sweetness of your fillings, whip up a little cream cheese and spread it over the peanut butter or jelly."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add texture to the filling.",
          "description":"You can add flavor and texture by sprinkling toasted nuts, pretzels, granola, potato chips, or chocolate sprinkles over the fillings. Try just adding one or two of these so you don't overwhelm the flavors of the sandwich. Try to add the crunchy ingredients right before you eat the sandwich. Some of these (like the potato chips) may become soggy if they sit on the sandwich for a long time."

Try using a rustic artisan bread, like sourdough or ciabatta. Use a bread that you normally enjoy eating. For a really rich flavor, use banana bread to make the peanut butter and jelly sandwich."

Keep in mind that some of these may make smaller sandwiches, so you'll want to make several of them. Consider using:\nCrumpets or English muffins\nBiscuits\nPancakes\nWaffles\nPita bread"

You'll need to butter both sides of the sandwich and grill it in a heated skillet until it's golden brown on both sides. For a really unique take on a grilled peanut butter and jelly sandwich, grill the sandwich on a waffle iron until it's crisp on the sides."

          "headline":"Cut the sandwich into shapes.",
          "description":"You can serve small peanut butter and jelly sandwiches by cutting them into small shapes. Just take a cookie cutter and cut near the center and sides of the sandwich, avoiding the crusts. You can use stars, hearts, ovals, or other fun shapes. You can serve the small sandwich bites on lollipop sticks. Push a lollipop stick into each sandwich bite so that guests can pick one up for a cute appetizer."

          "headline":"Roll the sandwich into pinwheels.",
          "description":"You can make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches more fun by simply rolling them up into pinwheels. Trim off the crusts and discard them. Use a rolling pin to lightly flatten the sandwiches, so they're easier to roll. Tightly roll the sandwiches and then cut them into slices. Try sliding several of the pinwheels onto skewers so you have peanut butter and jelly kebabs. These make great snack food."
