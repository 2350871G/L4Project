If you're sensitive, you may have difficulty sleeping, anxiety, irritability and stomach upset. Green tea can interact with some prescription medications like beta blockers (propranolol, metpranol), benzodiazepines (to treat anxiety), lithium (to treat bipolar disorder), clozapine (an anti-psychotic medication) and oral contraceptives. If you have been prescribed any of these medications, talk to your doctor about how much green tea you can safely drink."
