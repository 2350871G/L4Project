Aside from the general shimmery quality, metamorphic rocks often have a great deal of small reflective flecks. These are flecks of glittery crystal, not the quality shine of a precious metal or mineral. If you can\u2019t discern the smaller flecks, you can use a magnifier to see them in more detail. Metamorphic rocks like granite don\u2019t have bands, but they do have remarkably concentrated amounts of crystals."

Quartz crystals are almost clear, and they tend to stay that way after metamorphosis. Quartzite is non-foliated, so you won\u2019t see any bands or stripes in the rock. The paleness of quartzite often appears almost yellow in color, due to chemical discoloration and impurities in the rock."

Gneiss is composed of clear quartz and darker crystals, leading to remarkably differentiated striations. Less distinguishable bands suggest that the rock may be another kind. A gneiss rock will have a grey hue to it overall, with the dark and light strikes cutting through the gray coloration."

If you can\u2019t leave a scratch mark on glass with the rock, you are probably working with slate, marble, or phyllite. Each of these metamorphic rocks is soft enough that it can\u2019t scratch glass when applied at a mild pressure. Gneiss and quartzite, however, can both scratch glass with very little force. You only need to streak the rock against roughly 2 millimetres (0.079 in) of glass."

Marble found in nature often looks less \u201cpure\u201d than the kind of marble seen in buildings and statues, which can be confusing at first. The key to identifying marble is noticing the large crystals that seem randomly distributed, since it is a non-foliated form of metamorphic rock. Marble can vary widely in color, but the most common colors are white and grey."

You should be able to see the clearly divided sheets within the rock itself, which are considered foliations, though they do not look like the bands in gneiss.
