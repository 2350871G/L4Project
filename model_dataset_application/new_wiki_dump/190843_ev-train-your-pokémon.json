If you want to EV train your Pok\u00e9mon quickly, try to have them battle the Pok\u00e9mon who give the most points in the stat you are trying to improve. For example, fighting a Nidoqueen gives 3 EV points to HP, while fighting a Machamp gives 3 EV points to Attack. Keep in mind, however, that while some Pok\u00e9mon may give a high number of EV points in a particular stat, those Pok\u00e9mon may be hard to find.
