Do some research and utilize your best judgment in determining which sites offer the best means to scoring legitimate McDonald\u2019s coupons. Without passing judgment on the quality of the sites or their coupon offers, some popular third-party McDonald\u2019s coupon sites include: https://www.dealsplus.com/mcdonalds-coupons, http://www.retailmenot.com/view/mcdonalds.com, and https://www.coupons.com/coupon-codes/mcdonalds.com/.
