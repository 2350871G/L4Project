If you can\u2019t turn off the brush, you can still do a quick vacuum of the dust and dirt of the affected area. The vacuum removes and dislodges dirt and dust in between cracks of the limestone. If you have a limestone table or other surface that isn\u2019t flooring, use a handheld vacuum if available. Some vacuums come equipped with an attachment hose. This will also work for an elevated surface like a kitchen counter."

Fill a bucket of warm water and add a couple tablespoons (14 mL) of mild soap. You can use common hand soap or use a smaller proportion of dish soap. Dampen a rag by submerging it into the mixture and remove as much water as you can. Gently wipe down the area with the rag. Take your time and don\u2019t hesitate to spend extra time going over the stain with the rag. Soak the rag as many times as you need to."

Follow the instructions provided with the product but as a general guide:\nWet the poultice with distilled water. Apply the poultice to the stain or stained area. Leave it in place for 48 hours. During this time it will dry. The drying process enables it to absorb into the limestone. Rinse it off. The stain should have disappeared."
