Keep your rain garden away from driveways and sidewalks as well to avoid pathway erosion. Watch your yard's rainfall draining pattern during a storm. Try positioning your garden near where runoff naturally flows."

          "description":"Using a long, straight wooden board and a carpenter's level, measure the slope of your projected area. To get enough rain water into your garden, you'll need a slope of at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in 4-1/2 feet (1.32 meters), or 2%. Without this natural slope, you'll have to create it naturally by digging. Because rain gardens protect your yard from water overflow, you will want a slope of two percent or more."

          "headline":"Test the soil in your location.",
          "description":"Before you begin digging, check the soil to make sure it's suitable for your garden. While rain gardens can thrive with less permeable soils like clay, they will do best with well-draining or sandy soils. Dig a shallow hole in your projected area and fill it with water. If the water remains in the hole for two days, the soil is not permeable enough for a rain garden. If all the soil in your area is non-permeable, you can create suitable soil on your own. The ideal rain garden soil will be 30% sand, 30-40% loamy topsoil, and 30-40% organic matter. Till this mixture into existing soil for proper drainage."

          "description":"Typically, rain gardens range between 100 to 300 square feet (30.5-91.4 square meters). Any smaller, and your garden won't have room for plant variety. Build larger, and your garden will be hard to dig and ensure an ideal slope. How large your rain garden will be depends on your area's weather patterns. If you experience a lot of rainfall, you'll want a larger garden. Even small gardens, however, will help with runoff."

          "description":"Rain gardens are usually between 4-8 inches (10.2-20.3 centimeters) deep. If your location's slope is less than 4%, you'll want a rain garden between 3-5 inches (7.6-12.7 centimeters) deep. For slopes between 5-7%, create a rain garden 6-7 inches (15.3-17.8 centimeters) deep. Slopes between 8-12% will be best at about 8 inches (20.3 centimeters) deep. Rain gardens deeper than 8 inches (20.3 centimeters), or with a slope over 12%, will not be ideal. They present a tripping hazard and generally hold water for too long, becoming more of a pond than a rain garden."

Perennial plants last for several years, so plants at least one or two years old will have established root systems. Ask your local nursery for specifically mature plants to avoid receiving seedlings."
