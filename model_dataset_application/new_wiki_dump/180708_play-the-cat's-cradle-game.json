However, you\u2019ll have the easiest time using a piece that\u2019s around 40 inches (about 120cm) in length. This will ensure that the string is long enough to give your hands plenty of room to maneuver without getting in the way or becoming unwieldy. Tie the string together at the ends so that it creates a circular loop. Try cutting a piece of string, yarn or twine to just the right length to fit you and your partner\u2019s hands. If you can\u2019t find anything else to play with, use a tied shoestring."
