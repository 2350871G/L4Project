Wool, for example, is a delicate material and is very susceptible to shrinking in the dryer. Cotton, on the other hand, is tougher, and will need to be in the dryer at a higher setting. Silk will generally shrink about 8-10% in the wash. Determine whether or not the garment is pre-washed. New clothes will usually shrink on the first wash.
