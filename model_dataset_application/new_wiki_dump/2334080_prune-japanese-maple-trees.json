          "description":"Although you can prune your tree almost any time of the year, the best time to prune is in summer or winter. Summer is the easiest time to judge how much you need to thin the maple, and winter is best for seeing the branch structure. Avoid pruning the tree in weather hotter than 80 \u00b0F (27 \u00b0C), especially if the tree is located in full sun. Removing too much foliage can make the tree vulnerable to sun scald. Light pruning can be done at any point in the year except spring. The spring is when the maple has the most sap. Try pruning your maple about twice a year\u2014once in winter and once in summer, preferably."

Try not to prune the tree during these times, as this is when it's most prone to damage. Both low-energy times last about 2 weeks. Spring as a whole is the least-preferred time to prune your tree, but you can prune it safely so long as the leaves are finished growing in."

          "description":"If your tree has a disease or damage, wait for it to heal before pruning it extensively. Limit yourself to small cuts or deadwood removal, as even light pruning exerts some of your tree's energy. Use your best judgment about your tree's health. If it seems severely ill or weak, nurture the plant to better health before pruning. If you\u2019re pruning a diseased tree, sanitize your cutting tools so you don\u2019t spread the contamination."

You can always remove more after the tree's had time to heal. Start by pruning less than you think you'll need to cut to prevent over pruning. Cut back more if you see the need."

Prune your tree with gardening shears for small branches and loppers for larger branches to make precise, clean cuts. You can purchase pruning tools at most garden centers or plant nurseries. For especially thick or hard-to-reach branches, you can also use pruning saws or long-reach pruners."

Wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants can also protect your skin from scratches. Pruning can take up to several hours. Put on sunscreen to protect your skin against the sun's UV rays."
