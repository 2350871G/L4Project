It's also a good idea to make sure the trunk is closed and ensure that all of your car's windows are fully closed as thieves can use open windows to break into cars.

Saul Jaeger, MS\t\t\tPolice Captain, Mountain View Police Department\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: To help prevent theft, don't leave your valuables in your car where they're visible. However, if you're going to store things in your trunk, place them there before you reach your destination. Otherwise, a criminal may see you putting your valuables away, and they'll know that's the only place they need to focus on when they break into your car."

Thieves can amplify your key's signal from your front door and unlock your car. A good place to put your keys is on the kitchen table. The kitchen is usually located at the back of the home and is, therefore, one of the furthest points from your car. A tin/aluminum container will also block signals and can be used as an alternative. Hide your spare keys in a different but equally secure location."

If your car is parked in your garage, criminals are less likely to see it and identify it as an item to steal. Make sure your garage is secure if you do store your car in there."

Even if the criminals unlock the car, they'll have to take the cover off the car to get in. This increases your chances of catching them. If you want to buy a car cover, try your local garage or car dealership to see if they sell them."
