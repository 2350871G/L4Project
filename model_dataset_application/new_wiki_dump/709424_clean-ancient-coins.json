Split your coins into three categories: showing good detail, showing some detail, and showing no detail. Start working on the coins that need the least amount of work. Dirt can probably be removed by simply soaking them in distilled water. You may want to have the coins that need a lot of work cleaned by a professional."

Also, some coins will have harder or more difficult deposits that will require more work. You may have to try multiple methods to get the coins clean. Start with the safest and least abrasive methods before you move on to something else."

Do not use tap water because it may contain ions and mineral that will inhibit the cleaning process. Try scrubbing the coin with a toothbrush after it has been soaking for a few days. Change the water every few days as well. This is a slow process and may take many months until your coin is clean."

If you do not have a toothbrush, you can use another stiff brush. However, never use a metal brush because the bristles will scratch your coin."

          "description":"Washing your coins with olive oil is the safest way to clean your coins as you cannot leave the coins in olive oil for too long. It has been used for years and is very reliable. Put olive oil in a closed container, and then place your coins in the container. Change the oil once or twice a month. If you want to speed up the process, gently scrub the coin with a toothbrush. Wait at least a week before you scrub the brush with a toothbrush. Scrub the coin with dish soap under running water. Place it back in the olive oil if it is still dirty. This is the slowest way to clean a coin. It may take months before you begin to see results."

Hold the coin in your hand and then use the curved part of the blade to scrape the coin. Be very careful and go slowly when you do this. Use circular motions and keep the blade as flat as possible."

All of these are made from materials that are softer than your coin so the risk of damage is minimal. Try different tools to see which works best on your coins. Also, wear safety glasses so you do not get any debris in your eyes. Work on a small area of the coin. You can apply a little bit of lubricant (i.e. olive oil) to help loosen the dirt as well."

Pour malt vinegar into a shallow container and submerge the coin for 30 to 60 seconds. An electrical flow is created from the metal and the chemicals. Unwrap the coin and rub with your fingers to remove the debris. If the coin is very dirty, you may have to submerge it multiple times. You can also build an electrolysis machine using a battery/transformer, a wire, a tank, and a chemical solution. However, this is dangerous and is not recommended. There is a high probability of damaging your coin if you use this method."

          "description":"Chemicals can be used if your coin is heavily encrusted or has lime deposits. Be cautious when using chemicals to clean your coins. There is a higher chance of damaging your coin. Coca-cola, lemon juice, Noxon brass polish,, vinegar, and commercial bathroom cleaners (e.g. Lime-A-Way) are options. Let the coin sit in the chemicals for only a few minutes and then remove the coin and brush with a toothbrush. Test the chemicals with cheaper coins to see how long it take before the coin begins to erode. This can help you gauge how to treat your ancient coins. Vinegar and lemon juice are less harsh than other acids. Dilute the lemon juice with 50% distilled water and let the coins soak for 10 minutes. Chemicals should be used as a last resort."

Coins can be left in the solution anywhere from 1 day to 2 weeks. You must scrub the coin with a toothbrush every day when using Calgon. Check the coins to make sure that it is not being stripped by the solution."
