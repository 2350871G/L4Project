Talk to your friends, and see who is interested in helping. This will make things a lot easier on you. Consider the following:\nWho has what responsibilities. Try to spread the responsibilities out based on who is good at doing what. Who gets the cash. If it\u2019s your home, you should probably get the largest cut of the cash. Consider this and talk to your friends ahead of time so everyone knows what they\u2019re going to get out of the whole affair. Who has money and other supplies to bring to the table. You might want to include a friend who has a band or a good sound system in the party planning. Also consider people who have party planning experience and might have kegs or other important supplies. If you've got roommates, consider asking them to share the responsibilities of holding a \"rent party.\" Then, you'll all work toward the common goal of making enough money for rent that month."

A boring party that lacks proper accessories could undermine your ability to have other parties later. A good stereo system. You\u2019ll need a system that can fill your home or backyard with sound. Don\u2019t go overboard, though. You don\u2019t want your neighbors calling the cops and you don\u2019t want to completely drown out conversation. A beer pong table and cups. Beer pong is one of the best ways to entertain your guests. Make sure you have all of the appropriate supplies. A poke table, cards, and chips, for more sophisticated crowds. A pool table or some trivia games. The money to buy or rent a beer keg and other alcohol. You won\u2019t make any money if people have to bring their own alcohol.

A small portion of people will be sitting at any given time. So don\u2019t plan for more than 20% of your guests to be sitting at a given moment. Parking. Parking is extremely important, as most of your guests will probably arrive by car. Make sure you\u2019ve got enough parking for the number of people you plan on hosting. Space. Take stock of the sorts of rooms and outside space you have to entertain. Can you fit 20 people comfortably into a living room? How many people can be standing around your pool in your backyard?"

Some people won\u2019t like it, and won\u2019t come back next time. Instead, find a \u201cmiddle\u201d beer/liquor that appeals to the most people possible. Charge for admission. Charging for admission, at the door, is one of the easiest ways to make your party pay. However, there are a few pitfalls in this approach. The likelihood is that people will be coming and going in and out of your house and backyard all night. You can\u2019t really expect to stop them each time they go in and out. Consider:\nGiving out wristbands to people who have paid. This way, you\u2019ll be able to identify people who have paid and people who have not. Making sure alcohol is supervised. If you\u2019ve given out wristbands, and you\u2019ve got someone pouring drinks, you\u2019ll easily be able to stop people from freeloading off of your liquor who have not paid. This approach also has the added bonus of weeding out underage drinkers. Providing food in addition to alcohol and other drinks. If you charge for admission, make sure that admission is worth it (otherwise people won\u2019t pay). Relatively inexpensive hotdogs and hamburgers could go a long way in enticing people to pay up to get in. Know the laws in your area. Charging for admission to a house party might create liability for yourself. Frame your party as a \"Rent Party.\" Let your friends and other guests know that the goal of the party is to raise money for your rent that month. This is a good way to getting people to volunteer donations, as they'll not just be funding their own fun for the night, but they'll be helping you out in general. Pass around a jug or bowl at the party for donations. Ask friends to chip in whatever they can for the cost of the party. Make sure that the party is worth it, as some of your friends might be in hard times of their own, and won't take kindly to be asked for money if you have not supplied alcohol, food, and entertainment. Ask for donations for alcohol. Charging for alcohol is at house parties is illegal in many places in the United States unless you have a license that allows you to do so. One way around this (in many areas) is to ask for donations for alcohol. This has advantages and disadvantages. It will help you with some people might not want to pay for a party they might not stay at. However, you\u2019ll also run into people who won\u2019t want to donate, and you could lose money. Know the laws in your area. People might circumvent you and bring their own alcohol \u2013 then you won\u2019t make any money. You\u2019ll need someone always standing by the alcohol to collect donation money. Hold a tournament of some sort. One way to try to turn a profit from your house party is to hold a tournament and charge for playing. Entice your guests with a substantial prize, like a bottle of liquor or tickets to a concert if they win. Whatever money is left after you pay for the prize will be profit. Consider:\nBeer pong. Poker. Pool. Trivia. Enjoy your party. Perhaps most importantly, your party should be a good time for you and your guests. While profit might be your priority, why have a party if you\u2019re not going to have fun? Enjoy the part, enjoy the moment, and enjoy the fact that you are making all of this fun possible for other people. And in the end, your party might help pay your rent next month!",
