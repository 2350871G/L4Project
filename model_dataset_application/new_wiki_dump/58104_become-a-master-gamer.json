Get an ergonomic controller with a good weight distribution to stay comfortable during your games. Controller preferences are largely personal, so read reviews and visit a gaming store to try a controller out if you can. If you really want to compete in games, stick with wired controllers. Wireless controllers are convenient, but they are prone to lagging, which is delay between an input on a controller and the corresponding action in the game. If you\u2019re a PC gamer, you can plug in a standard Xbox or PS4 controller into your USB port and use it as a gamepad for most games getting published today. This is a major disadvantage in first-person shooters though, since the mouse and keyboard will be more accurate."

Get a headset with a high-quality microphone so that they can hear you as well, which will make it easier to coordinate plays and communicate the enemy\u2019s movements during competitive games.

Get a mouse with additional buttons on the side to bind important keys to them, and look for a mouse with a wide range of DPI setting for accurate movement. Get a keyboard that feels good to use and has a reputation for staying responsive over long gaming sessions. There is a lot of love in the gaming community for mechanical keyboards, which use physical switches under each key to trigger a command (as opposed to a digital output). They tend to be more responsive according to some gaming enthusiasts. DPI is short for dots per inch. It is a measurement used to indicate how responsive and accurate your mouse is. Look for a mouse capable of 400-1600 DPI to give yourself a ton of options when it comes to your personal settings."

If your computer generally runs fine but struggles with newer games, look into getting a new graphics card. If it can render great graphics but moves kind of slowly, consider buying a newer CPU. Adding more RAM can seriously upgrade the overall performance of your computer.Tip: If you only have the money to upgrade one part of your PC, opt for a better graphics card. If your graphics card can render images more efficiently, your CPU won\u2019t have to work as hard to process information. Unlike gaming consoles, like the Xbox and PS4, you can upgrade individual components in your computer. Even if you aren\u2019t comfortable doing it yourself, you can take your PC to a computer repair company and pay someone a small fee to do it for you. Apple computers are rarely used for serious gaming. They don\u2019t have as many customizable components as a PC and most game publishers don\u2019t make games that are compatible with Apple computers."

Take a 5-10 minute break once an hour to prevent eye strain, give your wrists a break, and reset your body.Tip: If you find yourself raging and getting frustrated, put the game down for the day. It will still be there tomorrow and there\u2019s no reason to ruin your day over a game. While it depends a little on what kind of game you\u2019re playing, you should play no more than 3-4 hours a day to preserve your eyes, wrist, and ensure that you aren\u2019t sedentary for too long. Calmer games, like turn-based RPGs and puzzle games, can probably be played a little longer. Physically-intensive games, like first-person shooters and horror games, will require slightly longer breaks and shorter gaming sessions. Video game addiction is a serious problem. If you find yourself struggling to put the game down, talk to your parents or a close friend and look into seeing a therapist to help you cope with your issues."

Xbox One and PS4 both have notification systems. These can be shut off from the home screen under the \u201csettings\u201d or \u201caccount\u201d tab.

Playing other titles in your game\u2019s genre will give you insight into what mechanics and strategies make your game unique. You\u2019ll also get a different type of practice with the same hand-eye coordination that your game requires. If you\u2019re trying to master fighter games, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, and Soulcalibur are important titles to have experience with. If your goal is to master real-time strategy games, Age of Empires 2, Warhammer, Starcraft, and Company of Heroes are key games to play. If you\u2019re trying to master MMOs, Guild Wars, World of Warcraft, and Eve Online are helpful games to understand the genre.

For example, if you want to master Counter-Strike, visit https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/. If you want to master Mortal Kombat, visit https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/.

You can use the built-in recording equipment on the Xbox, PS4, or PC, or buy a capture card and install it in your console or PC and use the accompanying software to record longer sessions. Review the footage after the match to study your mistakes and figure out what you need to improve upon when you practice in the future. On an Xbox One, simply double-tap the Xbox button in the middle of the controller to automatically record video and save it to your console. If you have a PS4, press the \u201cShare\u201d button on the PS4 controller. Set the recording length and play your game. You can also prompt a recording in the middle of a game by pressing the share button twice like you\u2019re double-clicking on a mouse.

Turn shadows totally off to really give your console or PC a performance boost. Ping refers to how long it takes your computer to interpret information from an online game\u2019s servers. High ping means a longer delay between you pressing a button and something happening in game. V-sync (short for vertical synchronization) is mandatory for making sense of a lot of first-person shooters, but it\u2019s usually not necessary for side-scrolling or isometric games.

This is a major obstacle to improvement, since blaming the game removes any critical analysis of your own behavior, making it harder to identify what\u2019s going wrong. When you get frustrated, take a deep breath, take your hands off of the controller or keyboard for 4-5 seconds, and relax. Then ask yourself, \u201cWhat am I doing wrong and how can I improve?\u201d\nA positive attitude can go a long way towards getting better at the game. If you focus on things that you can control, as opposed to things that you have no control over, you\u2019re more likely to find a way to improve. If you aren\u2019t having fun, stop playing. It\u2019s not worth wasting your time on something that you don\u2019t actually enjoy when there are plenty of other games out there."
