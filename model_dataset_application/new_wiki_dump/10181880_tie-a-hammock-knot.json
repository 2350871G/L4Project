Buy a paracord or something similar that can hold at least 700 to 1,000 pounds (320 to 450 kg). You can buy these at sporting goods stores. Most hammocks come with loops on the ends that can be connected to a carabiner and rope, but you will most likely need to buy the paracord separate from the hammock."

If you\u2019re using a tree as your anchor, the bark will help the rope stay in place and you won\u2019t need to wrap it around as many times.

You need to have about 2 feet (0.61 m) of rope to work with, especially if you are new to tying knots. Make the 2 ropes parallel to each other when you finish.

You can either tie another bowline hitch at the other anchor, or you can use the taut line hitch to make an adjustable knot to finish hanging your hammock. An adjustable knot is advantageous, especially if you aren\u2019t sure of how low the hammock will swing once you actually get in it. The taut line hitch allows you to tighten or loosen the slack of the hammock."

Press in the hinged section of the carabiner and loop it through the end of the hammock, then release the hinged section to secure the carabiner. Carabiners can be purchased at sporting goods stores or even at your local home goods store."

If you\u2019re using a tree as an anchor, wrap the rope around the tree 1-2 times. If you\u2019re using a pole or other hammock stand, wrap the rope 3-4 times.

Taut line hitches are often used for hanging up clotheslines or food bags, so this knot can come in handy for many other things! Cross the end of the rope over the long strand and make 3 loops. Thread the loops around the long strand so they are enclosed in a big loop (end with the shorter rope pointing toward the anchor rather than pointing toward your body). Pull the loops tight. These 3 loops are what form the \u201ctube\u201d that allows the rest of the rope to slide back and forth, adjusting the slack of the hammock. Pull the short end of the rope down parallel to the long strand. Pull the working end back down after you make the loops so it is on the left hand side, while the longer strand remains on the right hand side (if you are looking down at the rope). Pass the end under the long strand and then up through the lower loop. Make a \u201cQ\u201d shape with the rope. Make sure this part of the knot is closer to your body than the 3 loops you made earlier. If you find that you are running out of rope, start over and give yourself a little more slack.
