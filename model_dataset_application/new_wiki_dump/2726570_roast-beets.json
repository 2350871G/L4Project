          "description":"Rinse the beets under running water, scrubbing them with a vegetable brush to remove any caked-on dirt. Beets are a root vegetable, so they naturally have a lot of dirt and debris on them. You can scrub the surface with your fingers if you do not have a vegetable brush, but you must get as much dirt off as possible before continuing further in the cooking process. Dry well before roasting the beets. Use paper towels to pat the beets dry. You can use red or gold beets. Both can be roasted using the same procedure."

          "description":"Use a sharp kitchen knife to slice off the majority of the leafy stem as well as the very tip of the lower root end. Leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of the leafy stems attached in order to make it easier to handle the beets. The beet greens or leaves can be saved for salads and other recipes. Only trim away the very bottom of the tip or tail. You can roast beets with the tips still attached, but removing them will make it easier to wrap the beets later when you roast them."

          "description":"Most beets do not need to be cut, but if you want to speed up the cooking time for extra large beets, consider cutting them in half from top to bottom using your sharp kitchen knife. Note that smaller beets tend to be sweeter and more tender. If using smaller beets, use 6 small beets instead of 3 medium beets. You can also use larger beets, but the larger the beet is, the tougher the center will be. Beets tend to range in diameter from 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5 cm)."

If you're using the oven for another dish, preheat according to that recipe and plan to roast the beets at the same time. The cooking time will change, but the beets will still roast fine, especially if the oven is between 350\u00ba and 450\u00baF (177 to 232\u00baC).

The beets will roast evenly enough even if they are not spaced apart, but leaving a little room in between the beets will allow you to wrap them more snugly with aluminum foil in a later step."

You can technically roast beets even without the use of olive oil, but the oil prevents the beets from sticking to the foil and may also prevent them from scorching. Moreover, olive oil adds more dimension to the flavor of the beets."

More recipes call for the use of salt than pepper, even though both can be used. Salt is thought to draw out more of the natural flavors in food, so even if you decide to skip the pepper, you should still consider adding the salt. If you are uncertain about how much salt and pepper to add, start with \u00bc tsp (1.25 ml) salt and \u215b tsp (0.6 ml) ground black pepper."

Use your hands to gently press the aluminum foil around the top of each beet, creating a snugger, more secure cover. Using nonstick aluminum foil will prevent the foil from sticking to the beets as they roast."

When the fork glides in easily, the beets are tender enough to remove from the oven. Check the beets every 20 minutes or so to make sure that they have not begun to scorch. If they show signs of scorching, drizzle 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of water over each beet before returning them to the oven. Large beets may need to cook for more than 1 hour. If a beet is not tender, return it to the oven and check again in 15 to 20 minutes. Some beets may need up to 2 hours to cook fully."

You can rub the skin away with your bare fingers just as easily as you can with a paper towel, but using a paper towel prevents the beets from staining your hands, especially if you cannot wear food-grade plastic gloves while peeling. If desired, you could also peel the skin away using a small paring knife. Note, however, that skin which refuses to peel away easily could be a sign that the beets have not yet finished cooking. If the skin is notably difficult to peel, you should consider returning the beets to the oven for another 15 to 20 minutes."

If slicing the beets, consider cutting them into slices that are 1/4 inch (mm) thick. This is an easy-to-manage size that works well with most dishes or when enjoyed alone. Goat cheese is a common accompaniment to roasted beets. Other common accompaniments include sweet strawberries, orange segments, pine nuts, walnuts, and chopped mint leaves. These additions are especially popular if you end up adding your beets to a leafy green salad. If you plan on using your beets in a salad, consider cutting them into wedges. For sandwiches, use slices. Beets enjoyed on their own can be cut either way."
