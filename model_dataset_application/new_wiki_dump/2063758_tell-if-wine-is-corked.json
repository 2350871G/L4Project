The taste of the wine will be dull and will not exhibit any fruit characteristics. Some people also describe corked wine as tasting astringent. A wine that is only slightly corked may lack aroma and have very little taste. If you did taste it, and it is corked, the taste was probably quite unenjoyable. It may have even tasted reminiscent of paint thinner. Rinse your mouth out with water, and open up a new bottle."

          "description":"If the wine seems a bit off to you, don\u2019t just assume that it must be corked. There may be other culprits that have ruined the taste of your wine. Oxidized wine is wine that has been exposed to oxygen, which has caused the wine to taste flat and lifeless, and even a bit vinegary. If your wine tastes this way (think of the way a flat soda tastes in comparison to a fresh one, as the concept is similar), then there is a good chance that it has simply oxidized. The color of the wine (if it is white) will also have changed to a dull yellow or brownish color. Maderized wine is wine that has been overheated, perhaps as a result of storage or during transport. This wine will taste reminiscent of almonds or candied fruits, and the cork may be pushed a bit out of the bottle. This occurs because of the expansion that occurs when the wine becomes too warm. It is also possible that the wine has refermented. Although wine is a product of fermentation, sometimes excess yeast can interact with the wine once it is bottled, creating a fizzy taste."
