Do this by marking the outside of the square first, then infilling with the remaining blueberries. Try to keep this neat and uniform for the best appearance, with even white spaces showing through. Add the \"stripes\". You can draw a toothpick across the frosting at even intervals to create the rows before adding the berries; the indentation will give the berries something to sit in. If you are using raspberries, simply make 7 rows across the cake, leaving 6 white stripes in between. If you are using strawberries, either cut them in halves, or slice them, depending on what look you are trying to achieve. If you're short of time and patience, use whipped cream in place of frosting. Fresh cream should only be an at-home option, however, as it needs to stay refrigerated prior to serving, and won't be the best option for picnicking."
