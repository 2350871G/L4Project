You could also go the sweet route, enjoying them with cottage cheese and strawberries. Offset their slight bitterness with a bright, acidic vinaigrette. Grate beets over the top of a mixed green salad if you\u2019d rather include them more sparingly. Beets are a staple at most salad bars, which is convenient if you\u2019re dining out."

Cut the beets into thin slices and pile them on among red onion, tomato, cucumber and other nutritious veggies. Vegans and vegetarians can even use beets as a hearty, satisfying substitute for meat. Grill sandwiches to perfection with a panini press to make the crunchy textures stand out even more."

To keep the beets from being overpowering, include a couple sugary fruits or a squeeze of honey or agave nectar. This will help smooth out the taste a bit. Juicing is a great way to reap the nutritional benefits of beets quickly without having to choke them down as part of a meal. Peel beets prior to juicing to cut down on their bitter, earthy notes."

In a few short weeks, you\u2019ll have a delicious, tangy treat to toss in your favorite fresh recipes. Pickled beet strips can be used to add extra zest to juliennes and coleslaws."

After chopping the veggies to a consistent size, you can toss them with oil and stir fry them or steam them until they\u2019re soft. Cut the beets into inch long cubes or slivers to make them more manageable. Prepare a special root vegetable medley using seasonal beets, carrots, sweet potatoes, parsnips and taro."

If you\u2019re unsure how best to use them, look to soups that use similar ingredients like carrots and squash.

Bake the batter in a large cake pan or portion it into individual cupcake tins for fun single servings. To stick with the nutritional motif, you can even smother the cake in a healthy yet indulgent frosting made with avocado, cacao and natural sweeteners.
