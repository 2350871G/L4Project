Plant the akebia seeds 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) below the surface. Cover the seeds with soil. Water the soil again until soaked through, about 10 seconds.

Once the akebias have sprouted 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) tall, transfer them to the ground Watering the Akebia Water until you have soaked at least 8 inches (20 cm) of soil. Do this during the first growing season. This will help your akebia establish a deep root system, which is vital for survival. Make sure to water your akebia every day in the early morning or late afternoon. Soak 5 inches (13 cm) of soil with water when the soil starts to dry out.
