          "description":"Alleviate the visual heaviness of a black or brown couch with some added color. Don\u2019t be afraid to add lots of color since the leather is generally made in neutral colors. Pick some brightly-colored pillows to go on the couch, which will help break up the dark color. For instance, add some bright blue pillows in a solid color for a pop of brightness. Alternatively, try bright green pillows on a brown couch. For a light couch, try going a little darker with your pillows. You could use dark purple pillows on a light-colored couch, for instance."

        {
          "headline":"Pick different textures and patterns.",
          "description":"Add other textures to the leather couch to create visual interest. Since leather is smooth, woven or fuzzy pillows will break up the monotony and add a soft touch. Pick fun fabrics, such as faux fur, suede, or even just plain cotton. You could even use sequin pillowcases for visual interest. Similarly, instead of just using solid colors, throw in some fun patterns in bright colors. For instance, you could use floral prints on a brown couch or a Victorian-style print on a black couch. On light-colored leather couch, try adding a leaf pattern in various shades of green. For a bright-colored couch, you can afford some darker patterns, such as a dark blue pattern on a bright orange couch."

          "description":"Throws add a splash of color, but they also add textural interest, as they are a much different texture than the sleekness of a leather couch. Toss a big, fluffy crocheted throw over the back of the couch in blue, or even a neutral to add a pop of color and texture. Alternatively, try a quilted throw with colorful patterns. The throw can be purely decorational, if you want. Keep a basket of blankets near the couch to use for added warmth to when desired."

          "headline":"Find a complementary color for the couch.",
          "description":"Brown shades often pair well with greens or blue, so use that to your advantage. Pick accent colors that provide the perfect contrast to the couch so they blend together well. For black, try adding a bright color, such as bright red or green, or use a light gray for a complementary look. Another option for brown is fall colors. You can use red, burnt orange, and even yellow as accents for brown. Deep purple can add color without standing out too much. For a light tan couch, try adding pillows in shades of blue for a complementary color. You can even use patterned items. Choose plaid or checkered fabric for a traditional touch, or chevron or a geometric pattern for a modern look."

Choose colors that complement the couch, such as a cool tone if you have a gray couch or a warm tone if you have a brown couch. For instance, paint the room a neutral color, then add a teal wall behind the couch to brighten up the space. Alternatively, use a bright creamy yellow to give an airiness to the space."

For instance, try a bright red rug with a light pattern to match your red pillows. Center the couch on 1 edge of the rug, and then place furniture around the other edges."

Choose pieces that are proportionate to the size of the couch. Try to pick things that have some variation, both in the finishes and in color. For instance, a large entertainment center or a couple of bookcases can help draw attention away from the leather couch.

However, a light-colored couch will not create as much darkness in the room as a brown or black leather couch, so separating the couch will likely not be necessary.
