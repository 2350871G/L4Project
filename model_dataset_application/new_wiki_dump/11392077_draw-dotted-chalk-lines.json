      "headline":"Grip properly.",
      "description":"In order for the \"jumping\" action that creates the dotting, you'll need to allow the chalk to pivot in your fingers. Hold the chalk closer to the back end (about 75% down its length). Grip with the pads of your first two fingers and thumb. Make sure not to allow the chalk to slide back in your hand, but remember to allow your thumb to act as a fulcrum."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Begin your line.",
      "description":"Place the tip against the chalkboard and begin to push your hand forward. The chalk may begin to slide, but that's okay! You'll want to adjust the angle of the chalk with respect to the board so that it is near perpendicular. A good angle to try for is about 70 degrees, and adjust for the hardness of your chalk and the humidity in the room."

    {
      "headline":"Follow through.",
      "description":"Once your chalk begins the \"click\" and forms a dotted line, try to keep a steady pace, and adjust your arm so that you don't end up locking your wrist. Maintain the proper angle until you are finished with the line."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Experiment.",
      "description":"Try playing around with the relationship between your angle, speed, grip, and force - many different shapes and sizes of dotted lines can be achieved. After a couple of practice sessions you're sure to be a master."
