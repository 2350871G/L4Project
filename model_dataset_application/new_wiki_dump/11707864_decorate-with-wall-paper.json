          "description":"If you\u2019re looking to add just a touch of texture and interest to your space, choosing a subtle wallpaper pattern is a great option. While bright, bold patterns are a great way to add a bit of pizazz, a simple damask or barely-there floral or dot pattern in neutral shades can give your space a touch of elegance without feeling overpowering.Look for patterns with cream and beige tones to help elevate your space without detracting from the rest of your d\u00e9cor. Subtle patterns in neutral shades are a great option if you want to hang pictures or artwork on top of the wallpaper, since neutral colors won\u2019t overpower the space. For example, give your space a softer touch with a muted floral pattern."

          "description":"To give your space a glam makeover, try installing a high-shine or metallic patterned wallpaper to one or all of the walls. In addition to giving your space a chic and glamourous lift, shiny and metallic wallpaper will also reflect light and give your space a larger, brighter feel.For a classically glamourous look, try adding a high-shine silvery option around the entire space. To add just a hint of glam, apply a metallic gold and cream damask pattern to one of the walls in the room."

          "headline":"Select a textured wallpaper to warm up your space.",
          "description":"To give your space a cozy, more intimate vibe, try applying textured wallpaper in a simple, classic color. The texture on the wallpaper works like an area rug to warm up the space, while a classic color will keep it from feeling dated or overpowering.Unlike flat wallpaper, textured wallpaper is raised in sections of its pattern, giving it more dimension and adding some visual interest. For example, textured damask wallpaper often has a flat paper background with a soft metallic material that is raised slightly out from the flat background. For example, a textured grass pattern in a classic dark navy is a great option for a library or cozy reading nook, while a pastel textured damask pattern can add both warmth and a hint of glam to a bedroom or walk-in closet."

While big patterns can be overwhelming in smaller spaces, they can actually make larger rooms with high ceilings feel a bit more intimate.When decorating with large, bold patterned wallpaper, try balancing out the space by using furniture and d\u00e9cor in complementary colors and simple shapes."

Simple geometric patterns with thin lines tend to work in almost any space, while bright, bolder prints can give a larger room a fresh, modern feel.For example, try using a bright color, such as a grassy green or yellow, in a thin trellis pattern to give your entryway a splash of color. Try a more subdued light grey Greek key pattern in your bedroom for a preppy yet understated look."

While overusing these delicate patterns could risk overwhelming your space and making it feel outdated, using a timeless lace or lattice option can add a touch of elegance when used sparingly for d\u00e9cor, on one wall, or on the ceiling. For example, try applying a dove grey and white lace pattern to the wall behind your bed to give your room an instantly sophisticated look."

This will allow you to section off the space and give it its own purpose without having to physically separate it from the rest of the room.For example, try applying wallpaper over a fireplace mantel or on a recessed wall in your entryway to define the space while keeping it open. If there isn\u2019t an easy or clearly defined stopping and starting point for the wallpaper, you can frame it off with molding to make it look clean and purposeful."
