Take into account temperature fluctuations, soil quality and density, rainfall, wind protection, and altitude. If you purchase a pod, remove a seed from the pod to plant - do not plant the entire pod. Leave as much of the pulp on the seed as you can as that is food for the seed."

          "description":"Farmers of Theobroma Bicolor vary slightly in how they start their trees. Some make slight indentations into the soil and cover the seed in soil, while some bury their seeds up to 10 centimetres (4 inches) into the ground. The seed should be placed in an area that satisfies all of its needs (see Step 4, Part 2). Remember that Theobroma Bicolor is very easily diseased and most farmers lose between 30-100% of their yearly crop due to disease. In other words, having multiple trees isolated from each other is best to minimize risk."

This barrier is often 2-3 metres (79-118 inches) taller than the tallest tree and is made of a plastic tarp. If, at any time, tree-zero (first infected tree) dies, most farmers burn all of the trees in the primary isolation.

The height ranges from 6 - 12 metres (20 - 40 feet) but is normally at the lower end of the spectrum. Its leaves are long, ovular, and leathery and can be up to 30 centimetres (1 foot) long. The leaves are a vivid red when they first grow. The flowers are either odourless or lightly foul-smelling. They grow in clusters directly from the trunk and are about 1 centimetre (0.4 inches) tall and wide. Theobroma Bicolor flowers are white, rosy, pink, yellow, or bright red."

A ripe pod has numerous ridges running up and down the pod. Depending on the variety, the pod is can be pale orange, dirty orange, green, or a dark purple-green. On the inside, each pod holds between 20 to 60 seeds (also called beans). Each seed is about 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) long and is covered in a sticky, sweet, white pulp."

          "description":"Theobroma Bicolor lives between 30 and 300 metres (100 to 1 000 feet) above sea-level. The temperature must rarely fall below 20 degrees Centigrade (68 degrees Fahrenheit) or go above 28 degrees Centigrade (82 degrees Fahrenheit). The tree must be protected from wind as the root system is very shallow. Rainfall needs varies greatly depending on the variety, altitude, soil-water retention, but the minimum is 100 centimetres (39 inches) with 150-200 centimetres (59-79 inches) of rain spread throughout the year being optimal. The soil must have good drainage as the surface bark can easily rot and be rich in humus. As Theobroma Bicolor grows in the understory, the plant should be kept in good shade."
