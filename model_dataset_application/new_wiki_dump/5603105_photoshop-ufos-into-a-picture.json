While you can use whichever method you prefer, the following steps explain how to use the \"quick mask\" tool. Click the \"quick mask\" button on the bottom of the tool bar on the left to enter quick mask mode. Double-click your \"background\" layer and rename it to unlock the layer. This will let you delete the background to make it transparent. Using the paintbrush tool, paint black for the area you want to select. (It will paint a red mask over your image.) Use white to erase. In this image, you can see the background has been selected. You can turn \"Quick mask\" on and off to make sure your selection is satisfactory. Press ctrl (cmd) + x to cut the background. You should be left with just the UFO floating on a transparent background. Save your newly extracted UFO file as .psd."
