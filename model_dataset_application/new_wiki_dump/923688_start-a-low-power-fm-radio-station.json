          "headline":"Understand unlicensed broadcasting.",
          "description":"Unlicensed broadcasting is legal using a low powered transmitter which was discussed in Part 15 of the FCC\u2019s rules. These devices are limited to 200 feet (61 meter) range. The transmitters are manufactured under the regulation of the FCC and have visible indicators for you to tell. One of the disadvantages of this system is that you have to accept any disturbance from a higher powered radio station."

          "headline":"Find an available frequency on the radio.",
          "description":"Before you take into account the necessary expenses of a low power FM radio station, you should seek out availability. The FCC allows commercial radio stations to bleed into or overpower your radio station. Search through your local FM stations and find a station without any radio programming. The key is to find the purest static channel. Make sure there aren\u2019t other voices or sounds lingering in the background. If there are a couple \u201cclean\u201d stations in a row, then you\u2019re in good shape. If you live in a metropolitan city like Chicago or L.A., you will have trouble finding a station like this. You can do a quick check by visiting radiospark.org/rfree for a search of available stations in your area."

          "headline":"Find out what type of station your community needs.",
          "description":"You are a member of a community and feel the need to power a radio station that your community is lacking. Consider if other members of your community want the same type of programming on the airways. A good way to receive feedback is by creating flyers with information about your radio station. Hang the flyers around town and in community active spots like a coffee shop, library, or a venue space. If the station becomes popular, it is legal to profit from advertisements. Say on the flyer, \u201cWhat do you want to hear on the radio?\u201d in big bold letters, and then explain what your station does."

          "description":"It'll help you keep track of what you need by making a quick list of all the equipment you\u2019ll need to power the station. This includes a transmitter, antenna, and basic sound equipment (microphones, mixer, CD player, etc.). Take a quick inventory of media devices you own like a turntable, CD player, cassette player, etc.). Do a basic search online to determine a rough price of the gear you\u2019ll need."

Other items to include are your goals and your performance standards. These are goals to strive for with a mission statement: to make it memorable, credible, inspirational, and simple. Take a look at some mission statements for nonprofit organizations online. Here's an example from the station AshevilleFM: \"At AshevilleFM, we're reflecting and adding to the rich stew of arts, culture and community involvement that is Asheville. We're bringing music, news, and the unusual to the airwaves at 103.3FM here in Asheville while having a global reach through our online stream with over 1.7 million hits a month.\""

Look into some organizations that could be interested in your radio station. Once you find a local organization, draft a letter explaining your fundraising goals and include your mission statement. There are many websites that allow you to make a fundraising pitch online."

You can generate the bulk of your station's broadcast with only a computer playing music, miscellaneous sounds, and even your own voice. Many radio stations record shows on computers and play them at a selected time over the airways. If you are first starting out, a computer will cut down on a lot of your audio costs. You can upload your radio show as a podcast or as an internet radio station with a computer."

          "description":"Unless you plan to play music alone, you should invest in at least one microphone, if not two. You will also need an audio mixer to switch between multiple audio outputs like a turntable, microphone, and computer. For a good quality microphones invest in a Sennheiser MD 421 or a Shure SH 55. There are options if you don\u2019t want to deal with audio equipment. You can invest in a USB microphone that goes directly into your computer. These mics have been continuing to grow and offer a range in quality. Consider getting help from a tech-savvy friend if you\u2019re beginning to feel overwhelmed."

          "headline":"Obtain other audio equipment.",
          "description":"Asides from the microphones and mixing boards, you\u2019ll need cables to attach everything together. Most transmitters take an \u215b\u201d jack (headphone jack), so you\u2019ll need to use the right converters for your mixer. Other cables that might help you are XLR cables (for microphones) and RCA cables (for external audio players). If you went with the USB microphone, you don\u2019t need to worry about this step. You\u2019ll also need one or two sets of headphones depending on how many people plan to talk. For future endeavors, you should have two headphones or more. If you use multiple headphones, you will also need a headphone splitter."

You can spend a small amount of money ($80), or spend a larger sum of around $300. For a cleaner signal, shop for a mono transmitter opposed to a stereo transmitter. Some transmitters come with an antenna, but these models aren\u2019t as powerful or reliable."

          "headline":"Use a good antenna.",
          "description":"Remember a good antenna is a must for clear and long transmission. An antenna that works well on one frequency may not work as well on another. Some audio stores will have antennas for FM transmitters, but you will probably have more luck shopping online. You can also purchase a custom antenna, tuned to your radio frequency.
