Whilst this looks effective it is really easy and it will take you longer to read it than to do it! To marble colors take a ball of two colors, the white and the dark chocolate and roll out each piece of color into a rough cigar shape about a foot long and the width of your finger, there is no need to be precise at all here. Pinch them together lightly and then twist the colors together, take each end in one hand, roll one colors in one hand away from you and at the same time roll the dough in the other hand towards you. The effect is like a bread stick a rope of colors. The more that you twist the icing the more marbled the final effect will be. Then pull the two ends to the centre, which, means the dough is intertwined, and in a rough U shape. Lightly dust your work surface with cornstarch to stop the icing from sticking and place the rope on it. Roll-out. When you are happy that you have achieved the colors and the size you are aiming at, you are ready to ice the cake.  Icing and Decorating the Cake  Place the largest 12-inch cake on the cake stand and cover with the already marbleized colored brown icing to cover the layer.  Trim the icing at the base, and then gently place the shells around the base for decoration, if you wish they can be stuck into the icing.  Top the 10 inched sized cake topped with the marbled icing, and cut roughly at the base, place this cake over the bottom layer of the cake on the cake stand.  Roll out a little of the icing to two cigar shapes and top with two inverted ice cream cones covered with the fondant. Cut the icing with a fondant embosser to cut out the windows, and cut out a little of the icing for the door. Place a roll of icing on the workbench and cut out the little rectangles for the top of the keep Cover the eight inch cake with the marbled icing over it, trim the base roughly and place over the other two layers on the cake stand. Add a darker piece of the fondant to the base and cut out the windows and doors. Place the smallest cakes which were cooked in the circular mugs on the top of the cake and cover with the fondant. Cut out the white fondant to decorate the windows. Cut out strips of icing and emboss as decorations on top of the castle. Invert the last ice cream cone and cover with the fondant. Use the antique gold to highlight areas you want highlighting as in the gold base of the ice cream cone. Cut out a selection of anchors and sea horses with the remaining white icing and place at strategic points around the cake. Decorate with the remaining shells. Decorate parts of the cake with luster dust to highlight the color contrasts.",
