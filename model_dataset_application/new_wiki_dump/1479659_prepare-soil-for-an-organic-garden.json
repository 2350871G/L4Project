Properly aerated soil ensures that roots obtain the oxygen needed to thrive. Ensure the soil is not too dry. If it is too dry, it will not only appear dry but also be brittle or hard to the touch. Water the ground well and return the next day to check it again. Ensure the soil is not too wet. Obvious signs include instances in which the ground is flooded is muddy. Remove weeds and debris. Tilling under green matter will require waiting about a month until planting. Pay a local farmer to cultivate a large garden, or use a rotary tiller to turn the soil.

Pat Browne and Steve Masley of Grow it Organically say: \"You need to understand the structure of your soil. If you have sandy soil, you need to put organic matter in there to help retain moisture. If you have a clay soil, you need to open it up and make it more porous so the water can penetrate it.\""

      "description":"While plants need sunshine and water to survive, they also need the vitamins and minerals provided by decomposing organisms to thrive. Place a layer of organic compost over the entire area. Approximately 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) of compost, worked into the first 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) of soil is one of the most commonly used methods to prepare organic soil. Request leaf mold from the town leaf dump, if available. The leaves should be decomposed, as fresh leaves will harm your organic garden. Ask a local farmer for manure. Most family farmers will gladly offer it for free, particularly if you do the work to obtain it. Use only aged manure or it may burn your plants. If only fresh manure is available, compost it for at least 6 months before applying. Raise your own organic matter by planting buckwheat, hairy vetch, or rye. Either compost these or turn them under, waiting a month before planting."
