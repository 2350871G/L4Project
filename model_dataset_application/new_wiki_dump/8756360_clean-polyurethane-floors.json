If you don't have a vacuum cleaner like that, you can turn off the interior rotation brushes (if possible) to make the vacuum for your floor. If you can't turn off the interior rotation brushes of your vacuum, check that it doesn't scratch the floor before you use it to vacuum the entire room. You could also use the vacuum's brush attachment as an alternative to the vacuum itself."

Add a small cap- or spoonful of a mild cleaner, such as dishwashing soap or a wood floor cleaner, to clean water. Use one cap per bucket of water. Dip the mop in the solution. The mop should only be damp, so squeeze out as much water as you can. When you mop the floor, go in the direction of the grain. Change out the water as needed. Make sure you don't use more cleanser than is recommended. This can mess up your floor."

However, mild dish soap in a bucket of water or a mild floor cleaner should be just fine. Wait a few minutes for the cleanser to treat grime and buildup before you mop it up. However, don't let it dry on the floor, as this can damage it. You can also use a cleaner like Simple Green (one part Simple Green to eight parts water) if you are trying to clean up grease spills, such as if you're cleaning a garage. Alternatively, you can use half a cup of ammonia in a gallon of water. Skip acidic cleaners, such as ones with vinegar or citrus, as they can damage the coating."
