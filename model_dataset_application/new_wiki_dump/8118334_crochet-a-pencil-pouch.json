At the last loop, chain 1 (snag working yarn and pull it through loop on the hook) and repeat the same process. (You chain 1 after every row or else you won't get a square pencil pouch.) Double:\nWrap yarn two times around hook and then insert the hook through the first loop hanging from it. Snag working yarn with hook and pull it through that loop. There should be three loops on the crochet hook. Yarn over again and pull it through two loops on the hook. Yarn over again and pull it through the last two loops. Yarn over 2x and repeat this for the whole row. At the end, chain 2. Begin all other rows with wrapping the yarn twice around the hook and ending rows by chaining 2. Triple:\nWrap yarn three times at beginning of row. Snag working yarn and pull it through the first loop hanging from the hook. There should be four loops on the crochet hook. Yarn over and pull hook through first two loops. Yarn over and pull hook through second two loops. Yarn over and pull hook through last two loops. Yup. There it is!
