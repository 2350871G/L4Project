  "text":" All Hearts Jam Sandwich Cut out the large hearts first. For each sandwich, you'll need 2 slices of bread cut into large heart shapes. Repeat for as many sandwiches as you need. Cut out the inner heart. Use the smaller heart cutter to cut out a heart shape dead center of the large heart. Only do one piece per sandwich though, as only the top piece needs the heart hole. Spread a generous serving of jam or preserves across the bottom heart. Repeat for each sandwich you're making. Spread a thin layer of cream cheese across the top heart. Repeat for each sandwich you're making. Carefully place the top heart onto the jam heart layer, cream cheese side facing downward. Press together gently but avoid squeezing the cream cheese out. Arrange the jam heart sandwiches on a plate. Serve immediately or keep covered and chilled in the refrigerator until needed. Fairy Heart Jam Sandwiches Prepare the bread slices in exactly the same way as for the \"All hearts jam sandwich\" above.  Spread a generous layer of jam or preserves across the base layer.  Place the heart hole layer on top.  Fill the hole with sprinkles. Be generous! This is the fairy's heart. Arrange on a serving plate. Serve immediately or keep covered and chilled in the refrigerator until needed. Toasted Heart Jam Sandwich Toast the bread slices.  Spread one layer of toast thickly with delicious jam or preserves.
