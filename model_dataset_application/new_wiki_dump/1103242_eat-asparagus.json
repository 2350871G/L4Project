          "description":"Fresh asparagus is a luxury vegetable, and its prices tend to reflect this. You can buy fresh, frozen, or canned asparagus. If you're buying fresh, look for bright green or violet-tinged spears. Spears should be straight, firm, and uniformly-sized, with closed (not flowering) tips. Ideally, buy fresh asparagus on the day that you plan to use it. Asparagus spears range from thick to thin. Some people prefer one kind over another, but size does not generally signal quality or flavor. Thicker spears are more mature, and thinner spears less so. Thicker spears often have tougher, woodier ends, and most people chop these off before cooking. Asparagus goes bad quickly, so it\u2019s important to pick bundles that are refrigerated or on ice. Do not buy asparagus that isn't being kept cool, as it may go bad even more quickly."

          "description":"Cut the ends of the asparagus if the spears are thick. Wash the asparagus. Fill a large pot with a couple inches of water and place a vegetable steamer into the pot. The water should not seep through the holes in the steamer; if it does, pour some water out of the pot. Put the asparagus in the pot and bring to a boil. Steam until soft or until you reach the texture you want. Consider serving steamed, grilled, or roasted asparagus as the first course at dinner. It is traditionally served with fresh-melted butter or freshly-made Hollandaise sauce. Eat with forks or fingers. Asparagus gets soft and moist when you steam it, and the result can taste bland. Add salt and other seasonings to spice up the flavor. Bear in mind that even though asparagus is very healthy, adding tons of salt and other seasonings may offset the health factor."

          "headline":"Grill your asparagus on an outdoor grill.",
          "description":"Cut the the ends of asparagus if the spears are thick. Wash the asparagus. Make a \"boat\" with aluminum foil for the asparagus to go in; the sides should be high enough to prevent the oil and asparagus from spilling over. Pour 1-2 tbsp. of olive oil into the aluminum foil \"boat\", and lay the asparagus in on top. Place the \"boat\" on an outdoor grill on medium heat until the spears reach the texture you want. Asparagus gets tougher when you grill it, but it still retains all of its moisture. The best part is that when it's cooked, you don't lose any nutrients! This is one of the simplest, tastiest ways to eat asparagus if you don't want to work it into a more complicated recipe."

Then place the asparagus onto a hot griddle pan; ridged is ideal, but a flat iron skillet will do. Leave on a medium heat until blackened on one side (1-2 minutes).

Sprinkle with salt and fresh-ground pepper, and bake at 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for 10 to 15 minutes. You can stir your roasted asparagus into a risotto or a creamy pasta dish. You can also serve the roasted asparagus as a side-dish to meat, fish, and pasta. Consider adding a couple of fresh garlic cloves and a dash of freshly-grated lemon zest. Consider roasting with butter, salt, and parmesan or mozzarella. Consider chopping the baked asparagus and sprinkling it on top of oven-baked macaroni.

Serve blanched asparagus spears in salads, or eat them on their own with dressing and seasoning. For a simple and tasty dish, add a bit of coarse salt and a drizzle of olive oil to your asparagus before serving it.
