It is also well-suited for small plants, such as strawberries. Other hydroponic methods include a deep water culture system, a nutrient film technique system, an ebb and flow system, an aeroponics system, and a drip system."

Hydroponic strawberries need a temperature range of 57\u00b0 F to 70\u00b0 F (13.8\u00b0 C to 21.1\u00b0 C). If you don't have an area with lots of natural light, you'll need to install artificial growing lights."

Growing strawberries from seed can take two to three years to produce fruit, while rootstock will produce fruit within a month or two, depending on the variety. Ever-bearing or day-neutral varieties are recommended for indoor growers. Carefully remove a strawberry plant from its container. Clean the soil from the roots by gently shaking.

Carefully rinse the roots under cool, running water.

Fill a bucket with cold water and soak the root system of your strawberry plant for at least 10 minutes. This will ensure all dirt has been removed as well as prevent the strawberries' runner roots from dehydrating when they are transplanted. Place your strawberry plant in the container. Carefully hold the crown of the plant and arrange the roots so that they are splayed over the growing medium. Cover the roots with growing medium. Add enough of your growing medium to fully cover the roots of your strawberry plant. Be sure you don't cover the crown of the strawberry plant; it must have light and air. Check the reservoir level daily. You'll want to keep a close eye on the reservoir level to ensure your strawberries are getting enough of the nutrient solution.
