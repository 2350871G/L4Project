          "description":"Eating at restaurants instead of cooking at home can cost a lot of money. Instead of purchasing a quick meal at a restaurant, consider buying ingredients at a grocery store and cooking at home. For lunch you can make sandwiches at home the night before. The average American spends $232 a month eating at restaurants. Divide that by the typical 30-day month, and you save $7.73 per day."

          "description":"Impulsive buying can ruin your $10-a-day savings plan. Instead of buying a product on the spot just because it catches your eye, give yourself a day to think before purchasing it. When you think about buying something, determine how necessary it is and how much it would actually benefit you. If you see a magazine or some candy placed temptingly near the check-out register, remind yourself what your long-term goals are, and simply pass such items by. The average candy bar costs $1.14."

You can create a spreadsheet and update it when you get home, or you can download an app that helps you track your purchases throughout the month. Diligence and accuracy are important so that you can look over your expenses in a realistic and objective way. The most useful spending-tracker apps include BillGuard, Dollarbird, and Fudget. Purchases you should track include food, gas, clothing, entertainment, cleaning supplies, coffee, and snacks."

Give yourself a baseline for how much you should be spending on these things. Try to maintain a cushion for emergencies. Inevitable repairs or medical problems will come along to disrupt your budget. Gradually build up some savings to set aside for those events. That makes it harder, of course, to save for retirement, but ultimately you'll come out ahead if you have money set aside for emergencies instead of having to borrow to meet them."

The average smoker spends more than $2,000 a year on the habit. In some locations the cost is considerably higher than that. Vices like drinking and smoking take a toll on your health, too, which could cost you dearly in future medical bills."

There are things you can do to prevent yourself from being tempted to deplete your savings, such as opting out of a bank or debit card. Deposit your money into a money-market account, so it can earn interest over time. Regular savings accounts pay very little interest. Online banks that pay more than 1% annually include, Synchrony Bank, Ally Bank, and Barclays. Bank interest rates are variable and change with the market."

Register for discount cards at stores that you frequently shop at, and follow your favorite store's social media accounts so you'll see  announcements for promotions and sales. Learn supermarket sale cycles, as sales change month to month. Purchase items when they are at their lowest possible price. For example, in January, foods like celery, avocado, and broccoli are typically on sale. Take advantage of clothes sales cycles as well.

Find stores that allow you to combine different coupons for more savings. Some stores will allow you to \"stack\" store and brand coupons together. Some stores will honor competitors' coupons; others will simply match prices. Stores that allow you to use competitors' coupons include Bed Bath & Beyond, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, and Office Depot. Price matching means that a store will meet a competitor's price on a product. Stores that do this include Walmart, Amazon, and Staples. Combining coupons with sales can allow you to pay even less. Doing all of these things together could result in hundreds of dollars in savings when you go grocery shopping."
