          "description":"White cotton needs to be washed separately from dyed cotton to prevent colors from bleeding. For example, washing a piece of red clothing with a piece of white clothing could lead to some of the red dye getting onto the white fabric. Separate the two piles into different machines, or two baskets to wash one after the other. The \"white\" pile doesn't need to be pure white. Anything you don't want stained by bright colors should go in the white pile. This could include patterned white fabric, muted pastel colors, or light grays."

To test if the machine is too full, try sinking your hand into the drum. If it doesn't fit or feels tight, the machine is too full. If the machine only had a few items in it, use a \"quick\" or \"small\" setting so that you don't waste water."

You can also add fabric softener at this point, if you like, and you can add bleach if you are washing white fabric. Bleach is harsh on fabric, so use it sparingly to remove difficult stains on white fabric."

          "description":"\"Normal\" settings on a washing machine are usually created with cotton in mind. This setting has a fast spin cycle and uses warm water. Depending on the manufacturer, this cycle could be called regular, normal, or cotton. Override the warm water of a normal cycle by choosing 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) as the temperature. This a gentler and more energy-efficient option for cleaning."

It is also more energy- and cost-efficient than using hot water. 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) isn't the coldest water setting, but it is the most effective with most detergents. Some washing machines let you set separate temperatures for the wash and the rinse cycles. Select 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) for both. Make sure to use a detergent that is compatible with cold water. Some powdered detergents won't fully dissolve in cold water."

If you chose a normal setting and it automatically set the temperature to \"hot,\" leave the temperature setting as is. Keep in mind that heat can shrink cotton. Check if your cotton is pre-shrunk before washing it in hot water."

Air drying cotton also saves energy and extends the life of your fabric."
