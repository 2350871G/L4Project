          "description":"Latex, or acrylic, primers are frequently chosen for interior surfaces like drywall. They dry out more quickly and emit less fumes than oil-based products. They also last a long time and make walls easier to clean. Latex primers have improved over time so that they work on a wider variety of surfaces. You can find latex products that hold up very well on exterior surfaces as well. Latex paints come in a wide variety of colors and finishes. Since they can only be applied over a matching primer, latex primers offer more versatility than oil-based primers. Latex primers adhere well to soft woods, brick, concrete, and some types of metal. They can be used to paint outdoors."

          "description":"Oil-based, or alkyd, primers are used with oil-based paint. They are more effective at covering over old stains and resisting new ones than latex primers are. This can make them the ideal choice for surfaces that have been painted previously or ones that are prone to staining. However, they are slow to dry and release harmful fumes that have to be ventilated while you\u2019re working. Although oil-based products are often used outdoors, they can be used on many types of interior surfaces as long as you\u2019re careful. They are better than latex at covering bare or unfinished surfaces. Oil-based primers should be used if you\u2019re working on a surface already coated in oil paint. Oil-based primers work well on most surfaces, including wood and steel. Use them to seal these surfaces against stains from color bleeding or rust, for instance."

These products can only be used in certain situations, mostly for renewing interior surfaces that are undamaged or have been painted in the past. Get seperate paint and primer if you\u2019re looking for something more versatile. You can color-match a combo product to an interior wall and repaint it. Combo products also work well on fresh drywall. Avoid using a combo product on wood, stains, or peeling paint. Also, don\u2019t use them to switch from dark to light colors or from an oil to a latex paint finish."

Make sure the exterior ones have UV and moisture-resistant additives. These additives help the primer resist weather, sunlight, and mold damage. Interior primers don\u2019t have additives and won\u2019t hold up well when used outdoors. If you\u2019re planning on painting both indoors and outdoors, get a combined interior/exterior primer. These products are are versatile and have additives that make them damage-resistant no matter where you use them."

By matching products this way, you can better ensure that the paint will stick to the primer. If you\u2019re working on a surface that has already been painted, try matching the primer to the existing paint. If you\u2019re unsure what paint you\u2019re going to be working over, use an oil-based primer. Note that high-quality latex paints can often be applied over oil-based primers. This can be a good option for transitioning a pre-painted surface to a latex paint finish."

Drywall primers fill in the gaps so you have a consistent surface to paint over. A drywall primer is also good to use on spots repaired with drywall. If you don\u2019t prime patched areas, they end up looking spotty. If you have plaster, switch to an oil-based stain-blocking primer instead.

Latex-based primers are best for oily stains from things like grease or crayons. Oil-based primers do better with water-based stains, such as from smoke or wood. If you have knotty or colored wood, always use an oil-based primer. The tannins in the wood rise to the surface and show throw regular primer. Shellac is a great primer for wood.

Oil-based primers tend to hold up well on metal and are effective at sealing out moisture than can cause rust. Paint tends to flake off of metal, so you should always use a good primer first to make it more resistant to damage."

Gray primer covers over dark paint with fewer, thinner coats than white paint. It\u2019s not as useful if you plan on following it up with a lighter color of paint.
