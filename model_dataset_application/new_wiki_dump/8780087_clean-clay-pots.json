  "text":" Removing Loose Dirt Empty your pots of all dirt and plants. Before you can clean the pot, it obviously needs to be empty. Dump out old plants and dirt. If you want to keep the plants in the pots, remove them gently and set them in an empty pot until the original pot is clean and dry. Brush away dirt. Once the pots are empty, brush away as much of the dirt as possible with your hands. Most of it should come away easily, but some of it may not. Scrub the pot with a brush. For stubborn dirt, use a stiff bristled brush. Brush gently back and forth across the surface of the pot. Don't use metal bristles on your clay pots - they can scratch the pot and leave white marks in the clay. Soaking the Pot Mix a water and vinegar solution.
