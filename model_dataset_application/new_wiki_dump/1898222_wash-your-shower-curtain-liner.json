  "text":" Using Your Washing Machine Separate the shower curtain and the shower curtain liner. You can wash them both the same way, but, depending on what the actual shower curtain is, that could change. You might want to add something to the soap, or wash at a different temperature, for a cloth curtain as opposed to the plastic-y liners. It is ok, however, to wash them together if they are the same material. Set your washing machine for a small to medium sized load with warm water. Place the liner in the wash, then set the machine to warm water. Liners made from plastic can become brittle when washed in cold water, while the warm water in your washing machine is no more damaging than the warm water coming out of your shower head. Fabric liners will also get cleaner if you use warm water. Let the washer start filling up and pour in about a cup of vinegar. You can pour this right where the soap is supposed to go. Add as much soap as you deem appropriate. A half-portion of your normal soap amount should be fine, as this is about half the size (or less) of a normal load of laundry. Do not use fabric softener on your liner. The liner is not fabric -- it is plastic. The softener will do nothing but give a strange, chemically smell to your liner. Choose a gentle, regular cycle.

While you could stick it in the drier for a few minutes on cool to shake off excess water, be careful. Hot air can melt the liner and ruin both it and your dryer. Using an Alternate Method Remove the shower curtain liner and throw it in the wash to remove surface stains. Simply take it off, remove the big plastic cuffs, and put it in the washing machine. This method is more for surface stains, not removing mold. Add a towel to the load. This will be used to \"scrub\" your liner. Again, this method is more to wipe up surface stains than do a deep cleaning. Run the wash, adding a little vinegar or soap to kill bacteria. You won't need nearly as much as needed for a full load.
