By writing about what you focus on each day, you'll gain an appreciation of what is wasting your time and energy. The first step to changing your habits is to take note of them."

          "description":"It's easy to discount the value of money and to spend it without any planning. Setting aside a portion of your income each month to put into a savings account can help give you more financial freedom. Create budgets for each of your needs, such as housing, groceries, bills, and your social life. Save money by setting a realistic spending budget and by making goals to save for bigger expenses. Save spare change in a jar, and then bring it to the bank when you have filled the jar with coins. Mark bills and other payment deadlines on a calendar so that you are never caught off-guard by a big expense. Preparation is key to financing your future."

Think of ways to cut back on any waste of planetary resources. Try walking or riding a bike to work instead of driving, for instance. Much of what we use can be reused or recycled. Used objects can also be repaired or passed onto a friend or sibling."

Be sure to fix any leaks in faucets or toilets right away. Take short showers and limit water usage while rinsing dishes, using only what is necessary to clean. Your utility bill will surely thank you, and your carbon footprint will be reduced as well."

In the US, about 40% of food waste is generated at one's home. Be sure that you are only purchasing what you need and will eat. Ask for food to be packaged if there is any leftover when you go out to eat. Any uneaten home-cooked meals can also be stored as leftovers. Stock up on plastic wrap and tupperware containers for easy storage in your fridge. Eat leftovers in a timely fashion to avoid the spoiling of food."

Multi-tasking can actually make you less productive and can waste your time. Make a list of everything you need to accomplish, and tackle them one task at a time. Spending time with organized people can motivate you to become more organized. An organized friend can not only inspire you, but can also hold you accountable for your messy habits."

Refrain from constantly being connected to the Internet and instead check your email only periodically. Creating a list of manageable goals can help you to determine how to spend your time more effectively. Take short breaks between each task and reward yourself for completed goals in order to motivate yourself. Set yourself up to be accountable for your actions by letting others know your goals. Checking in periodically with a supportive friend can help you stay focused and on track. Give yourself rewards for accomplished goals. You deserve to celebrate even your small successes, since each step you take is a move closer to your larger goal.

Realize that your time and attention is valuable, and that you deserve only the best. If someone is treating you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, you should communicate this to them. Reward yourself for making moves toward distancing yourself from this toxic relationship. You need to put yourself first, since you are your strongest ally in life.
