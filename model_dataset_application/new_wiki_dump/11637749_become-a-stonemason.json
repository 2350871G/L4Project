You also want to make sure that masonry is something you'll continue to enjoy throughout your working life. Important skills for a mason to have include:\nPhysical strength and stamina: Stonemasons typically work 8-10 hour days, much of it on their feet. You'll need to be able to lift more than 50 pounds (23 kg) repeatedly, as well as carry your own tools and other gear. Dexterity: Placing bricks and stones correctly requires precision and there is little room for error when you're carving a stone. To be a stonemason, you have to be good with your hands. Hand-eye coordination: You have to work quickly to apply smooth, even layers of mortar and quickly wipe off any excess before it dries. You'll also need to be able to line up bricks or stones according to a plan. Balance and stability: You may need to balance on scaffolding to set bricks and stones on taller buildings and structures. You also may need to scale buildings if you're repairing existing stonework."

Banker Masons typically cut, carve, and shape stones in workshops using hand and power tools. Builders or architects give them plans and they cut or shape the stones to the specifications in those plans. Fixer Masons travel to various job sites to fit and lay pre-cut stone for buildings following the blueprint for the structure. They may also make repairs to the stonework of existing buildings. Memorial Masons carve headstones, statues, plaques, and other monuments. They typically work independently and are commissioned for specific projects.

Let them know that you're thinking about becoming a stonemason and would like to ask them some questions about their career. Most will be willing to talk to you and share their advice. Come prepared with specific questions you want to ask related to anything you're curious about. You'll also want to ask them open-ended questions that give them a chance to talk about their career. For example, you might ask them \"What is the most challenging part about being a stonemason?\" You might also ask them if they've ever regretted becoming a stonemason or if there's any other career they wish they'd gone into instead.Tip: If you haven't decided what type of masonry you want to go into, you might talk to experienced masons from all types to help you choose."
