      "description":"Many of us get into a habit of always using the card when cash may indeed be the better option. Cash once spent is gone. Credit once charged continues to hang over our heads. If you do not need the traceability benefits of a credit card receipt and if you are only spending small amounts, it is often better to use cash. Keep your receipts or ask for a receipt if you need certainty about the transaction. And make some purchases credit-free zones, such as:\nSnacks\nGroceries (you will have long eaten the items before paying for them)\nMinor clothing purchases, such as socks, pantyhose, hair accessories\nEntry fees to gardens, entertainment places, cinema etc. Use debit cards instead and have the cash drawn immediately. If you cannot afford this, then maybe you cannot afford to be entertaining yourself. Toys - the reason for this is that if the toy is not affordable with spare cash, it is a good lesson for the children about saving. Seriously. Dining out. If you can't afford it in cash, you can't afford it at all."
