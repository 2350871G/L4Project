A standard utility knife is preferable, though something like an X-Acto knife or razor can also do the trick. Whatever you use, make sure the edge is nice and sharp. If you\u2019re using a utility knife with a removable blade, take a minute to insert a new one before you get started. You might also use a handheld electric carpet cutting tool. These tools feature durable edges and automated cutting action, which can help you sidestep the difficulty of doing it manually."

Point the blade downward and touch the tip to your starting point on the carpet. Then, press down just enough to pierce the carpet\u2019s tough backing. Cutting carpet is mostly a matter of getting through the backing, which is the hard, flat side that lays flush against the floor. Don\u2019t jam the blade into the carpet too deeply. You might blunt or break your knife, or even mark up the underlying flooring."

Use a straightedge to guide your movements, and pause every two or three feet to reposition before you continue cutting. Keep your wrist fixed to avoid making sloppy or uneven cuts. If you don\u2019t have the benefit of a straightedge, try feeling for one of the seams in the underside of the backing. Following a seam will help you make straight, steady cuts."

To keep the project moving along, be sure to have a new blade on standby. Working with a dull blade will only slow you down. It may seem like a hassle to have to keep stopping to change blades, but it will save you considerable time and labor in the long run."
