          "description":"Start by heating a little olive oil or butter in a frying pan. Add in sliced yellow squash, sliced bell pepper, diced broccoli, shredded cabbage, sliced onion, and/or diced tomatoes. You only need 1-2 handfuls, along with a dash of salt and pepper. Heat the vegetables until they're mostly cooked through, then pour in scrambled eggs. Cook until the eggs are set. You can also heat up leftover veggies to scramble with eggs using the same technique. If you don\u2019t have fresh vegetables or leftovers on hand, you can add canned vegetables to your eggs. If you want to add spinach, put it in when the eggs are almost done, and stir it up to wilt the spinach. You can add a sprinkling of cheese at the end, too. Serve it up with salsa, and you've got even more vegetables. Add a side of whole grain toast for a more filling breakfast."

          "description":"Fry up some diced potatoes, but mix in some veggies, such as bell peppers, onions, or even sliced cabbage. You can also use sweet potatoes, radishes, squash, or cauliflower in place of the potato. If your veggies aren't cooked, add them in the same time as the potatoes. Use up your leftovers by adding them to your breakfast hash. Wait until near the end to add precooked veggies. For a little more protein, crack an egg into the mixture at the end or serve it with a side of beans."

          "headline":"Mix shredded veggies into your pancakes.",
          "description":"Try adding shredded carrots (nuke them in the microwave for a minute or 2), raisins, and cinnamon to your pancake batter for carrot cake pancakes. For more interesting options, try shredded beets or zucchini, also with a little cinnamon. If you're not afraid to forgo sweet pancakes, try adding cooked spinach, onions, or mushrooms to your pancakes, then sprinkle a little cheese on them at the end or add a pat of butter instead of syrup. Canned sweet potatoes and pumpkin also make delicious, nutritious additions to pancake batter."

Pile on some spinach and tomatoes and wrap it up to take with you. You can also add your spinach at the end of cooking your eggs so you have wilted spinach instead of raw. You can also use kale, onion, thinly sliced cabbage, or even quickly cooked strips of bell pepper. You can make this up the night before and heat it in the microwave in the morning, if you don't mind your veggies warm. Another option is to freeze a bunch of these ahead of time and pop them in your microwave before you head out."
