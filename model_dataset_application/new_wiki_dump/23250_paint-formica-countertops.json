To clean and prepare the counter, you'll need:\nBucket\nGrease-cutting cleanser\nSponge or scrub pad\n150-grit sandpaper\nVacuum\nDamp rag or cloth\nDry rag or cloth"

          "description":"In order to paint your counter properly, you need to completely clear the surface. Remove any appliances, dinnerware, food, storage containers, plants, and decorations that are on the counter and store them elsewhere. You can store items in cupboards, pantries, on the kitchen table, or in the basement or garage. Do not store items on the floor around where you'll be working."

          "headline":"Remove the sink.",
          "description":"To protect the sink from paint and cleaning products, it's best to remove the sink from the counter. Start by shutting off the water supply to the sink. Before you remove the sink, you'll also have to remove the faucet. Use a wrench to unscrew the nuts attaching the faucet to the water supply. Remove the pipe, unscrew the nuts holding the faucet in place, and remove the faucet. Use a screwdriver to remove the long screws attaching the sink to the counter. Disconnect the sink from the water supply and drain pipes. Loosen the sink from the counter with a screwdriver if necessary, and remove the sink. If removing the sink isn't an option, cover the basin and sides of the sink with plastic, and tape the plastic in place."

When you're done, wipe the counter down with a clean, damp rag to remove leftover dirt, grease, and cleanser. Then wipe the counter with a dry rag and let it air dry for 30 minutes. Good grease-fighting cleansers for this job include:\nTrisodium phosphate: In a bucket, mix \u00bd cup (4 ounces) of TSP with \u00bd gallon (1.9 L) of water\nDenatured alcohol\nAmmonia-based cleaners, such as oven, all-purpose, and glass and window cleaners"

          "description":"One problem with painting Formica is that it's smooth and slippery, so the best way to get paint to adhere is to make the surface rougher. You can do this easily with sandpaper. Use a piece of 150-grit sandpaper or a sanding sponge. Rub the entire surface with the sandpaper or sponge. Apply even pressure with the sandpaper. Don't forget corners, edges, and crevices."

Then, wipe the whole surface down with a damp cloth. Dry the surface with a dry cloth, and then allow the counter to sit for at least 30 minutes to air dry completely."

Because of this, you need an incredibly durable paint. You can choose any color or style that you like, but look for a durable paint that's suitable for Formica, such as:\nTwo-part epoxy paints that are water-based\nLaminate paint kits\nInterior acrylic paint\nInterior oil-based alkyd paints"

The best kind of primer for your counter is an oil-paint. Try to match the color of the primer with the color you've chosen for the countertop. Pour your primer into the paint tray. Fit a roller with a clean roller brush and roll it in the primer. Wipe off excess primer on the tray. Cover the entire surface of the counter with a thin layer of primer. Use the brush to get into cracks and to manoeuvre  around edges. Wait about three hours for the paint to dry, then repeat.
