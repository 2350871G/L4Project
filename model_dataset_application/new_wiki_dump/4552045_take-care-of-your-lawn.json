          "description":"Your watering schedule should be based on grass species, lawn health, heat, and soil conditions. Cool season grasses (bluegrass, ryegrass, fescues) generally need 1\u20131.5 inches (2.5\u20133.8cm) per week, rising to 2.25 inches (5.7 cm) in hot, dry weather. Drought-resistant warm season grasses (buffalo grass, blue grama) can last for weeks without watering, even in the summer. Once you have a good guess for how much water your lawn needs each week, read the next step to find out how to divide it among watering sessions. A local university extension website can teach you how much watering your grass species needs in local weather conditions. To track the amount of water you're using, leave cans or other open containers on your lawn. Shaded grass usually needs less water, but this may not be true if it's competing with tree and shrub roots."

If your lawn is seriously compacted or has a thick layer of thatch, aerate the yard as described above. Shake water droplets from grass surface. Dew will not harm your grass, but \"guttation\" will. This is the formation of sugary water droplets along the blade edge, which attract disease and pests. To get rid of these, drag a hose or whipping pole over the surface, or hose them off with a brief spray. Improve poor grass in shady areas. If your grass does poorly in shade make these adjustments to shaded areas:\nWater less frequently but very deeply. Fertilize \u2153 or \u00bd as much as the sunny areas. Mow to 3 inches (7.5 cm) or higher. Reduce foot traffic. Care for lawns in winter. Minimize lawn use during frosts, when the lawn is vulnerable. If you need to break up ice, use as little salt as possible. Calcium chloride products are safer than sodium chloride or salt-laden snow. Never use fertilizers to break up ice, as they will run off along with snowmelt and pollute water sources. Stick to light use in early spring until the grass dries out and revives. If there are bare spots, seed them early before weeds take hold.",
