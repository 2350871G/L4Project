You can buy bottles online, or if there is a large ethnic community in your area, a specialty grocery store may carry it."

          "description":"Raki has an alcohol-by-volume (ABV) of 45% to 50%, so it\u2019s one of the stronger liquors, and some homemade varieties are even stronger. It\u2019s not traditional to take raki as a shot, so be prepared to sip your drink. Luckily, raki is nearly always served with snacks or a light meal or some sort, so you won\u2019t have to drink on an empty stomach."

Anethole can\u2019t dissolve in water, so when you add water to your drink, it separates the anethole from the liquor and creates an opaque milky color."

At a more extensive gathering, you\u2019ll probably encounter a mezze platter, which is a spread of things like hummus, baba ganoush, tzatziki, fresh cut vegetables, stuffed grape leaves, olives, tabouli, and other tasty dishes. A mezze platter is very similar to tapas, or small dishes meant to be shared with others. This supports the communal aspect of drinking raki with others."
