Balloons, for example, could be part of \"happy birthday\" or \"congratulations\" or \"thank you\", or you could draw a clown to go with them. Things like balloons and flowers can also be part of a larger bunch. Stamp yourself a whole garden, if you like."

    {
      "headline":"Create your own stamps.",
      "description":"You can carve your own stamp out of a potato, a sponge, an eraser, a piece of wood, or another block of soft material. Remember to start with a flat surface and carefully carve out any part you don't want in the stamp. You can trace the design with a pen, first. A potato is a good, inexpensive material if you want to try your own stamp or you're using a messy color, such as paint, but it won't last long. A cellulose sponge will produce a stamp with a built-in texture. Even if you don't cut it up, it can be great for creating a textured background. You can attach your homemade stamp to a backing, such as wood or cardboard, or use it directly if  the material is stiff enough. Remember that any design you do, and especially any letters you cut must be the mirror image of what you want to appear on paper."
