          "description":"Unlike most plants, gardenias are delicate and picky about their environment. Gardenias thrive in partial shade, high humidity, and an even supply of moisture and nutrients. Though they can be grown indoors, the hot, dry air and gloomy winter days can send the gardenia into a downward spiral. Ideal seasons to plant gardenias are during Spring or Fall, when there is the perfect amount of sun without too high a heat. Flower buds will fail to form if day temperatures are higher than 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C), if night temperatures exceed 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C), or if they fall below 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C) at night. Keep in mind that gardenias cannot stand to winter outdoors. You must bring them inside for the winter."

          "headline":"Test the pH levels of the soil to determine if the Gardenia will actually thrive when planted.",
          "description":"pH is a measurement of how acidic the soil is, and too high an acidity will not sustain a gardenia root. Acidity is measured on a scale from 0-14, with 0 being the most acidic and 14 being the most basic. Gardenias prefer acidic soil, so a pH level of 4.5 to 5.5 would be optimal since it is only moderately acidic. If necessary, add sulfur \u2014 a white powder that can be bought at most garden or home improvement stores \u2014 to help lower pH levels that are higher than 6. The soil itself should also be rich and well-drained. Gardenias require plenty of nutrients but their roots may die if over-watered."

        {
          "headline":"Dig a hole in the soil the size of the gardenia's root ball.",
          "description":"Make sure the hole is 2-3 times wider, as you will pack it with dirt once the root ball is planted. A root ball is the mass formed by the roots of a plant and the soil surrounding them. If your soil is in poor condition, add a small amount of compost to the hole before laying the root ball down. Compost is organic fertilizer and will add nutrients that your soil may be deficient in. Carefully choose where to plant the shrubs. By planting close to your house, you can enjoy the scent of the blooms from a deck or through an open window. But too close may mean that the soil pH may become too high for the plants to thrive. Also keep in mind that gardenias need a lot of light, but can't tolerate heat. Perhaps opt to plant near a bedroom window rather than a kitchen window."

        {
          "headline":"Set the gardenia's root ball in the hole.",
          "description":"Make sure the top of your gardenia\u2019s root ball is above the surface. Fill the hole half full with soil and water it. Doing this will help to settle the soil and eliminate air pockets. You want your gardenia's roots to fit snugly into the soil so that it can absorb plenty of water and nutrients. If you intend on planting multiple gardenias, be sure that you leave 3\u20136 feet (0.9\u20131.8 m) between each root ball. The gardenia plant can grow anywhere from 2\u20138 feet (0.6\u20132.4 m) both tall and wide. Planting too closely can result in overcrowding or competition between roots for water and nutrients."

Avoid over-watering the soil especially, because if it is kept too wet, the roots will be starved for air."

Mulch not only enriches soil, it will keep your soil moist, reduce the growth of weeds, and maintain a constant soil temperature. For the best outcome, select a mulch made of wood chips, sawdust, or ground bark. Applying mulch is extremely important since gardenia roots are shallow, making them especially vulnerable to weeds."

Spraying with water raises the humidity around the plant, but only temporarily. Therefore, it must be done daily in order to ensure that the gardenia survives. Other than spraying, you could plant gardenias in clusters without overcrowding them. This will create a pocket of humidity. To increase the humidity even further, you could place a dish of water in the middle of the cluster. As the water evaporates, it will cover the surrounding gardenias."

Gardenias are woody shrubs, so remove older, woody stems to encourage the growth of new branches. Prune the lowest branches which are in danger of touching the ground. This can lead to infections.

They feed on the sap of the gardenia and leave behind a waxy coating on the plant. This can result in twig death, impair plant growth, and cause leaves to drop prematurely. White flies are tiny white insects which resemble small gnats. They produce honeydew and the black sooty mold which grows on it.

If you are facing a large mealybug infestation, smother the gardenia with a good dose of insecticidal soap or horticulture oil. Two days after the first pass of insecticidal soap, cover the soil judiciously with a helpful fungus called Beauveria bassiana to kill any mealybugs that feed on roots.

Secure a cardboard box large enough to cover the shrub without bending the branches. Use old blankets, straw, or bubble wrap to insulate the plant while it is under the cardboard box. Despite your best efforts, the tips of the branches may die and turn black from frost or cold damage. When this happens, prune the branches a couple of inches below the damage with sharp pruning shears. Alternatively, you could transplant your gardenia to a pot and bring it inside for the winter. Though your plant will face higher chances of bug infestation, there are steps you can take to better care for your gardenia indoors."

The gardenia will also need to be in a room with a temperature of 64 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C) during the day and 55 \u00b0F (13 \u00b0C) at night. Adjust your house's thermostat accordingly and monitor your Gardenias' growth. Keep your plant free of drafts and never place a gardenia where it will receive direct force of hot hair from a furnace.

These bugs can be treated with a solution of one-part liquid soap and one-part water. Spray both the top and bottom of the leaves. This treatment is also effective on mealybugs. Spider mites are small and often hard to see with the unaided eye. To check for spider mites, shake the gardenia gently over a white piece of paper. If you notice red, yellow, brown, or green specs, you may have spider mites. Treat these pests with neem oil, which is vegetable oil from the neem plant. It is available in most grocery or department stores. Neem oil will also treat infestation of all the aforementioned bugs.
