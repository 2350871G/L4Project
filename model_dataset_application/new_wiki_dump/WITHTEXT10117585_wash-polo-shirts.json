          "description":"Before attempting to treat a stain, make sure it is completely dry. Be careful, though, since you don\u2019t want to make the stain worse. Scrape any solid matter off gently with a dull knife. Then, use a paper towel to soak up as much of the stain as possible. Treat stains immediately, if possible. The sooner you treat a stain, the easier it is to remove."

          "description":"Stain removal products include sprays, sticks, pens, and gels. All you have to do is apply the product until the stain is completely saturated. You can also work the spray into the stain using your finger or a laundry brush. You can buy stain removal products at most general stores."

          "headline":"Let the stain removal product soak in for 5 minutes.",
          "description":"Check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on the bottle for the recommended drying time, since this may vary slightly from product to product. The wait time will typically be short. If you\u2019re unsure, wait 5 minutes no matter what. You can then launder the shirt normally to remove the stain and the stain removal product. If you don't plan on washing the entire shirt, rinse the stain removal product off under cold running water."

          "headline":"Soak the stubborn stains in non-chlorine bleach before washing.",
          "description":"If your polo shirt still won\u2019t come clean, using bleach is worth the risk. Try using a bleach gel pen, but check the label first. Make sure the product doesn\u2019t include hypochlorite, which may wear out or discolor your polo shirt. Rub the product into the stain and launder the shirt immediately. You can also try adding some all-fabric bleach to your laundry cycle. This may take out stubborn stains if you don\u2019t have a gel pen. Non-chlorine or all-fabric bleach may still damage some polo shirts, so you may want to test the product on an inconspicuous spot first. Oxygenated bleach is useful for brightening shirts that look dull. It\u2019s used the same way as non-chlorine bleach."

          "description":"Sometimes light-colored polo shirts pick up dye in the wash when cleaned with other clothing. You may be able to fix this by mixing a color run remover product into water, then soaking the polo in it for several hours. Finish by washing the polo normally with liquid detergent. Your best chances of removing unwanted dye is right when you notice the stain. Once the dye dries, removing it is unlikely. You may also be able to remove dye stains on your own with rubbing alcohol or bleach."

Now turn the entire polo inside out, then flip the collar up. This should protect it during the washing and drying process. You may also be able to fix a floppy collar by spraying it with starch and ironing it."

Dark colors from other clothing can bleed and discolor light polos. In addition, avoid washing white polos with colored fabric. Polos with white stripes are typically safe to wash with both white and colored clothing. Be careful with red clothing or red-striped polos. Red dyes are the most likely to bleed.

Then, check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on the soap container to find out how much detergent to add. This depends on how big the laundry load is.

If you\u2019re in a rush, you can continue the cycle until your polo shirts are completely dry. However, briefly drying the polo this way gets rid of some of the water without causing heat damage to the fabric. Most wear and tear from machine drying won\u2019t show up right away. The polo may shrink at first, but the heat also can wear out the fabric over time.

The towel will absorb moisture from any parts of the shirt it contacts. If you have the towel in a good location, the shirt should dry out relatively quickly so you can store it. A polo that has been partially dried in a drying machine may finish drying in about 15 to 25 minutes, although this varies depending on your environment. If the shirt seems to be drying slowly, try flipping it after 15 minutes. This encourages both sides of the shirt to dry at an even rate."
