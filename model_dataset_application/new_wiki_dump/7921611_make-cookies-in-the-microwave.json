Cream the sugar and butter until they're light and fluffy. It will be easier to cream the butter if it's at room temperature. If you need to, soften the butter in the microwave in 5 second increments."

Add the last 2 tablespoons of your flour and stir until the dry ingredients are just combined. Stir in 2 tablespoons of chocolate chips. Avoid over mixing the batter or the cookie might be tough."

Scoop your chocolate chip cookie dough onto the center of the parchment so it roughly looks like a ball. Lightly press down on the dough ball to flatten it a little. Slightly flattening the cookie will help it spread out and bake evenly in the microwave. You can place a few extra chocolate chips on top of the cookie if you want it to look and taste even more chocolaty."

If the cookie still looks doughy, microwave it for 5 second intervals until it looks baked. Let it cool a minute before removing the cookie from the parchment. This cookie is best if served or eaten immediately. If you let it sit too long, it may harden."
