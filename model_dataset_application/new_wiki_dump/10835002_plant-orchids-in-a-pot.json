Pick a sunny spot for your orchid such as a south or east-facing windowsill. North-facing windows tend to be too dark for orchids and west-facing windows tend to be too warm. Check the specific sunlight requirements for your type of orchid to find the ideal number of sunlight hours. If your home doesn\u2019t have suitable natural light, use artificial lights instead. Place the orchid 5\u20138 in (13\u201320 cm) away from a fluorescent bulb and keep the light on for the specified number of hours. Orchids with leathery or few leaves like cattleyas and the dancing lady type tend to do best in high-light environments such as a south-facing windowsill. Orchids with limp or soft leaves like the moth and lady slipper types tend to grow best under more sensitive light conditions. Try an east-facing windowsill."

Orchid roots can easily rot if there is too much water in the growing medium, as the roots need good air flow to function properly. Simply hold the pot under running water for a few seconds and let the water drench the growing medium. Make sure that the growing medium has dried out fully before you water it again. Orchids cope much better with drought than overwatering."

          "description":"Most homes have humidity levels that are too low to sustain orchids, especially in winter. Keep the orchid in a place away from cold drafts and heating vents, as the plant needs warm, moist air to survive. Orchids tend to grow well in bathrooms where the humidity is high or near humidifier devices. If you don\u2019t want to place the orchid in the bathroom or use a humidifier, you can use a dry well instead. To make a dry well, get a plastic tray and either fill it with pebbles or place a plastic lattice on top. Fill the tray with water to the top of the pebbles or the lattice, and keep the orchid pot on top. This helps to boost the humidity."

Visit your local gardening center and purchase a liquid fertilizer that is suitable for orchids. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and dilute the specified amount of liquid fertilizer in the water. Then pour the water over the orchid as you normally would. Try to get a liquid fertilizer that is specifically for orchids. If you get a general fertilizer, use only half the amount that is recommended. Water the orchid regularly each week whenever you don't use the liquid fertilizer."

If you spot the roots creeping out of the pot or if the growing medium has broken down too much and is preventing aeration, then it\u2019s time to repot the orchid. Some orchids need to be repotted each year and others can stay in the same pot for several years. Don\u2019t repot the plant until it has stopped blooming for the year."
