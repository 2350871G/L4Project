When you have the need or just spare time, and have collected enough in your freezer bags, make your stock using the largest pot you have (a stock pot is best). Add all of your vegetables to 1/2 or 2/3 pot of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours. Strain the stock through a sieve.
