  "text":" Reheating Slow Roasted Hams Slice the ham into pieces. The size of the slices are up to you, but they should be sliced thin enough that they're ready to serve. You can slice up the entire ham, or you can do a bit at a time if you're not serving many people at once. Place the ham slices in a shallow baking dish and cover with foil. The foil will help to keep any moisture released from the ham slices inside the dish, which helps prevent the ham from drying out. The foil should be wrapped around the sides of the dish to prevent any heat from escaping. Reheat the ham in the oven. The oven should be set to 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius). How long you have to reheat it will depend on how much the ham weighs. You should leave the ham in the oven for 10 minutes for every pound (0.5 kg) it weighs. Check your ham to make sure it doesn't dry out. About halfway through your cooking time, remove the foil from a corner of the baking dish. The slices should still look mostly pink. If you notice them turning white, they're drying out. Add a few tablespoons of water to the dish and put the ham back in the oven. Warming Spiral Sliced Ham Place the ham cut-side down in a baking dish. Placing the cut side down helps trap moisture in the ham. It also prevents the glaze that normally comes on spiral sliced hams from drying out or getting stuck to the bottom of the pan. Cover the ham with heavy aluminum foil. The ham itself should be covered, and the foil should wrap around the edges of the baking dish. Heavy aluminum foil (as opposed to regular aluminum foil) will help protect the ham from drying out. Heat the ham for 10 minutes per pound (0.5 kg). With your oven set at 325 Fahrenheit (163 Celsius), heat the ham for about 10 minutes for every pound (0.5 kg) of ham.
