Do this outside or over a trash bag so you don\u2019t get hair all over your floors. For hair that's tough to get off, you can use a damp sponge.

Check the care instructions on the label of the item if you aren\u2019t sure. It\u2019s easier to steam items when they\u2019re hanging up. If you\u2019re on a budget, you can buy a handheld steamer, which typically costs around $30 to $40, instead of a standing steamer, which can cost over $100."
