It needs to be low enough to the ground that the animal can get through it, so shorter than the pet's legs. For the most part, pet doors will be low and to the side opposite the door handle, though it depends largely on what's on the other side of the door and how you want the pet door to look. Use masking tape to attach the template to the door in the desired location, using your level to make sure the door is oriented straight and flush with the rest of the door. Use your pencil or marker to trace around the template to create the shape that you'll cut out to make room for the door. Remove the template and discard it."

You want the hole to be big enough to maneuver your jigsaw through and cut out the space you outlined with the template. In some cases, you may have to remove the door entirely from the hinge to cut through it properly, depending on the space and the maneuverability you need. If so, you'll have to remove the hinges from the door and lay it out on some sawhorses, probably, to make the cut. Most of the time, you should be able to leave the door on the hinges."

Insert the jigsaw in the bottom left hole and turn it on. Start making your cut across the bottom, going slowly and as smoothly as possible, from the left to the right. Don't slow down so much you start to scorch the wood. Keep it moving at a comfortable pace, but don't go so fast you bog down the motor. Let the saw do the work."

The front side of the door frame should have a plastic flap hanging down, which will cover the hole and keep the door \"closed.\" On the back side, the covering should have four holes around the perimeter, through which you'll attach the two sides using the screws provided."

It'll take a lot more power to cut through a steel security door, or some other kind of metal door. Because you'll need to get the right angle on it and be safe, it's better to remove the door and lay it out in a flat position. Remove the pins from each of the hinges in the door by removing the cap and gently tapping the pin out.

          "description":"To get your cuts started, use a heavy-duty drill to start the holes at each corner of the template as before. With a metal door, it's a better idea to start with a small drill bit, about a quarter-inch or so, and make a pilot hole to open up a space for the larger half-inch hole. After you've gone around and drilled a pilot hole at each corner, put a larger drill bit in the drill and go back around to open up a half-inch diameter space."

Make sure you've got a heavy blade in the saw and that you go slowly, so you don't snap the blade while you're making your outline cuts. Go just as you would through a wooden door, starting in the bottom left corner and working your way around from corner-hole to corner-hole. You'll probably need to hammer out the cut after you've run the saw around it. A few taps should do it, and the loose metal should fall out easily."

          "headline":"Clean up the edges with a file.",
          "description":"After cutting through the metal, it's likely that the edges will be somewhat rough with burrs and little shards of metal. It's a good idea to use a file and clean up those edges to make sure the pet door fits in securely and safely, and to make sure you or the pet won't catch on any sharp metal pieces while you're working. File off especially large burrs to create a smooth edge. You don't need to be militant, just gently work off any large burrs you notice from your cuts with the saw. Don't go around so much that you make the hole bigger."

You may need to put several sheets of wood behind the screen door to get the pet door sandwiched between the screen and the wood so it does not move around easily. Carefully adjust the pet door or dog door frame so it is exactly where you want it. Check the manufacturers instructions to see that it is not upside down or that you have the wrong half in place.
