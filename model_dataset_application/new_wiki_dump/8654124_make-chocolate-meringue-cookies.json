          "description":"Add 3 egg whites that are at room temperature to the bowl of a stand mixer that's fitted with a whisk attachment. Mix the whites on medium until they become foamy, which should take 1 to 2 minutes. To separate the egg whites from the yolks, break the eggs against a flat surface. Over a bowl, separate them into two pieces, with the yolks falling into the lower half. Move the yolks back and forth between the halves, so the whites drip into the bowl below. Continue moving the yolks back and forth until all of the whites are removed. You can beat the egg whites with an electric hand mixer or by hand, though working by hand will take longer. Make sure to use a non-plastic bowl, though, because plastic can retain residue even after cleaning that makes it difficult for the whites to form peaks."

Mix in the sugar 1 tablespoon (14 g) at a time, though, and wait until all of it has been incorporated before adding more. Continue beating the egg white mixture until you can no longer feel the sugar granules and firm peaks form. Superfine sugar is also known as caster sugar. Be careful not to get any of the sugar on the sides of the bowl as you add it the mixture. If it does, stop the stand mixer and use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
