      "description":"As you trace the outline, make sure to go right along the outline. It also helps to lean your pencil along the forward path of the pencil. If you must pause, it is best to lift your pencil and resume the trace leaving a small gap. Whenever you start the trace, apply just a tad more pressure to compensate for the tendency to start light and transition quickly to a dark trace. The normal eye does not see small gaps in an outline and fills those in naturally. However, if you do not tilt your pencil at the same angle when you resume the trace, there will be a small jag and your eye will pick up on that."

      "headline":"Do not exert undue pressure on the template.",
      "description":"This will cause it to deform and you will lose the crispness of your design. Also, make sure to keep downward pressure on the template near your trace so that the pencil tip cannot slip beneath the template. Throughout the trace, the template should be firmly seated and not moved."

It takes a while to get used to this technique, but you can practice by lettering free hand and doing line drawings to refine the technique. Once you have established the habit, it will become second nature and will kick in automatically as you start to trace for maximum line crispness."
