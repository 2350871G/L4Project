Or, you can put all of your stuffed animals into a regular human sleeping bag. Because they're little, they will all fit it. Make things even cozier with a tent! To make a quick little tent, you will need a blanket, something heavy such as a large book (but not too heavy), and a table or something to put the heavy thing on. Grab one end of the blanket, and put it on top of the table. To keep it there, put the heavy thing on top of it. Repeat this with the other ends of the blanket, and a tent will form. Put a flashlight under your tent. Tell your stuffed animals ghost stories."
