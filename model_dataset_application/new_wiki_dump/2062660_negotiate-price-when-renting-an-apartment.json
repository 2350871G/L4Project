Waiting until your current lease is about to expire and you have to move immediately does not provide you with adequate time to research, plan, and negotiate. Leaving things until the last minute will also make the process more stressful. Prepare early so that you are negotiating from a position of strength."

          "description":"Avoid trying to rent an apartment during the busy rental season for your area. Landlords and property managers are less willing to negotiate if they believe there is a great demand for apartments and plenty of potential tenants. Landlords are often more willing to make deals at the end of the month, because they don\u2019t want a unit to stay empty for an additional month. If you live in an area with a college or university, try not to begin this process right before the start of a new semester since these are often the busiest rental periods. Most people move between May and September, so winter is good time to look for new apartments and negotiate more favorable deals with landlords."

          "description":"Educating yourself about the current rental market in your area will help you determine what might constitute a fair rental price, which is essential information to have during the negotiation process. Your research will also give you a better indication of whether the landlord or property manager might be willing to negotiate. Find out what the average apartment rents for in the neighborhood and city where you are looking to rent. Talk to others in the apartment building to find out what they pay per month. Ask your friends and coworkers about their rental rates. Review classified ads and note the rental rates for similar apartments in the area. Find out how long the apartment you want has been on the market. If it has not rented after 1 to 2 months of availability, the landlord will be worried about losing money and might be more willing to negotiate your rent. If you browse apartment listings online, pay attention to how long the units are listed. This will help you evaluate how much demand there is in the rental market for the type of property you are interested in."

A cosigner, or guarantor, is a third party who agrees to pay rent if you are unable to do so. From a landlord's perspective, this will help you seem like a more reliable tenant and a secure investment. Although a prospective landlord might tell you that you need a co-signer, you can also mention this option during the negotiation process. Landlords and property managers often look for tenants whose monthly income is at least three times the cost of the monthly rent.If you don\u2019t qualify based on this criterion, inquire about the possibility of a co-signer or guarantor."
