Against a computer, you might be playing 15 times faster than normal so be patient when switching back to human opponents. If you cannot win against the computer, stay with it, and furthermore, if you cannot win against the computer you will not win against real players. Take the next step and play against real people in play money games. If you have to keep adding money to your account you are losing, improve your game by studying heads-up from books and articles. When you reach the stage where you do not have to add play money to your account you are winning. Keep increasing your play money balance and remember that in a real game there is a fee for the house that is between 5 -10%."
