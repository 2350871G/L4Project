Add about one teaspoon of flour at a time until you get the right thickness. You can also add your seasonings to the flour and toss the meat in it before cooking it."

Continue whisking about 2-3 minutes after all the flour has been added. Combine this paste with the base liquid of your casserole before adding it to the casserole dish. 1 ounce (28 g) of butter and 1 ounce (28 g) of flour should be enough to thicken 1 US pint (2.0  c) of liquid. For a vegan version, substitute oil instead of butter."

Then, roll the thick paste into little teaspoon-sized balls. Add one ball to your casserole at a time, waiting about a minute before adding another one, until you get the right thickness. If you make too much beurre mani\u00e9, you can also freeze the remaining balls and use them later."

A few minutes before your casserole is done, add it a little at a time until you are happy with the thickness. Then, let the casserole finish baking.
