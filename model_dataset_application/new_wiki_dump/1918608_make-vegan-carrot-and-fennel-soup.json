  "text":" Roast the Vegetables Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) and spray a shallow baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.  Spread the fennel, carrots and onions on your baking sheet.  Drizzle the vegetables with the olive oil and sprinkle them with the salt and sugar.  Using clean hands, mix the vegetables, oil and seasonings until the vegetables are well coated. You can also mix the ingredients in a large bowl before you put them on the baking sheet. Spread the vegetables so that they are well spaced on the baking sheet. This will allow all sides of the vegetables to caramelize. When they are crowded on the sheet or pressed too closely together, they will steam, but they will not get the slightly crunchy coating that you want. Remove the pan from the oven after you have roasted the vegetables for about 30 minutes. They should be caramelized on the exterior and tender when pierced with a fork. Place the roasted vegetables in a Dutch oven if you plan to use an immersion blender or into a large bowl if you plan to use a traditional blender.  Puree the Vegetables with an Immersion Blender Assemble an immersion blender and submerge the end in the vegetables.  Turn the setting on the blender to \u201clow\u201d and puree the vegetables by moving the blender through the mixture until the vegetables are smooth.  Turn the blender off and set it aside for cleaning.  Pour the finished puree into the Dutch oven.  Puree the Vegetables with a Traditional Blender Fill a blender pitcher half full of roasted vegetables.  Attach the lid and puree the vegetables until they are smooth.  Add additional vegetables in batches and continue to puree the vegetables to a smooth texture.  Pour the finished puree into the Dutch oven.
