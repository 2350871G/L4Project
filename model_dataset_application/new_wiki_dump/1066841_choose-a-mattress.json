          "description":"Mattresses range from classic firm or plush options to higher-tech mechanically-operated beds with remote controls. Do some research on these commonly available options:\nBasic firm or plush mattresses. Basic mattresses are made from a variety of materials and are sold at every price range. Mattresses made with organic or natural fibers tend to be more expensive. You'll be able to choose from extra firm, firm, plush, and extra plush mattresses, depending on how soft or hard you like your bed to be. Memory foam mattresses. These mattresses are made from a material that molds to the shape of your body when you lie down, and holds that shape while you are sleeping. These are a good option for people who don't tend to move around a lot during the night. They retain body heat, so you may not want to go with memory foam if you tend to get hot while you sleep. Sleep number mattresses. These mattresses can be made harder or softer with the touch of a button. They are usually divided into different zones, so that your partner's side can have a different level of firmness than yours. Look into brand names, but don't be too biased. Sometimes brand names are better, but that doesn't mean you should overlook cheaper non-brand makes. A well-known name does not imply quality, though often times there is good reason for such a reputation. The important thing is to test mattresses in person and figure out what feels best for your own body. Understand that a high coil count doesn't necessarily translate into a higher-quality mattress. Mattresses with interlocking coils have coils that lock together. Mattresses with independent coils have a larger number of coils and are better for light sleepers, because they won't fluctuate as much with movement--especially when your partner shifts or gets out of bed.
