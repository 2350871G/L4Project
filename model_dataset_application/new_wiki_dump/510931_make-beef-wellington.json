You can set this aside until you prepare the rest of the beef Wellington, or you can put it in the fridge to let it cool faster. Wrapping the Beef Place overlapping strips of prosciutto on spread-out plastic wrap. Spread a couple pieces of plastic wrap flat on your countertop so that it\u2019s twice the length and width of the beef tenderloin. Place each strip of prosciutto on the plastic wrap, overlapping them slightly so that they\u2019re all touching and will easily stick together. Your layer of prosciutto should create a square\u2014using 4 or 5 strips works nicely. Spread the duxelle onto the prosciutto. Use a spoon to scoop the duxelle (the mushroom mixture) onto the strips of prosciutto. Spread it out evenly across all of the prosciutto, making sure there\u2019s a flat layer on the entire square.

By lifting up the ends of the plastic wrap, you\u2019ll be able to cover the beef tenderloin with the prosciutto easily and tightly. Tie the ends of the plastic wrap together so they don\u2019t come undone. Letting the beef sit in the fridge helps the prosciutto stick to the tenderloin, so you shouldn\u2019t have any trouble removing the plastic wrap from the prosciutto-wrapped beef. Preheat the oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) and spread out the puff pastry. While the oven is preheating, spread out plastic wrap on the counter just as you did for the prosciutto. Place the puff pastry on the plastic wrap, spreading it out so that it\u2019s in a flat, even layer. Roll the prosciutto-wrapped tenderloin in the puff pastry. Unwrap the beef tenderloin from the plastic wrap and place it in the center of the puff pastry. Lift the plastic wrap to cover the tenderloin in puff pastry, making sure it\u2019s nice and tight. Cut off any extra puff pastry so that none of it is overlapping. The beef Wellington should resemble a log once it\u2019s all wrapped. Use the plastic wrap to tie up the puff pastry and set it in the fridge for 15 minutes. Once the tenderloin is wrapped in puff pastry, roll it up using the plastic wrap and tie the ends so that it stays together. Place the beef Wellington in the fridge for 15 minutes to let it set. Baking the Beef Wellington Brush the beef Wellington with the beaten eggs. Take the beef Wellington out of the fridge, remove the plastic wrap, and place it on a tray. Beat 2 eggs together until they\u2019re a smooth consistency, and then use a basting brush to spread the egg onto the puff pastry evenly. The egg coat will give the puff pastry a golden shine once it\u2019s cooked. You can also sprinkle salt on the puff pastry, if desired. Set the beef on a lined baking sheet and put it in the oven.

If you don\u2019t have parchment paper or foil, you can apply an even layer of cooking spray to the baking sheet so the beef Wellington doesn\u2019t stick.
