  "text":" Preparing the Dough Mix the butter and shortening together with a wooden spoon. Stir until they are well combined. Add the sugar. Mix again until the ingredients are light and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla. Stir until the ingredients are well combined. Whisk together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl.  Add 1/3 of the dry ingredients to the bowl of wet ingredients. Stir until they are just combined. Continue adding the dry ingredients gradually, stirring between each addition.  Baking the Cookies Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl using a fork or a whisk.  Scoop the dough out by the tablespoon. Shape it into balls using clean hands. Roll each ball in the cinnamon and sugar mixture using your hands.  Place each ball of dough onto the baking sheet, leaving about 2\u201d/5 centimeter (2.0 in) of space around each ball. This will allow the dough to spread as it cooks. Bake the cookies for 6 to 10 minutes. A shorter cooking time produces a softer cookie, while a slightly longer cooking time produces a crunchier cookie. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the stovetop for 2 minutes.  Loosen the cookies from the baking sheet using a spatula. Place them on wire racks to cool completely. Carefully arrange them on a serving plate. Treat your guests to some sweets.",
