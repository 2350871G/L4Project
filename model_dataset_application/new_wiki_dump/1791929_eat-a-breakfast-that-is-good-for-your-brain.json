          "headline":"Make eggs for breakfast.",
          "description":"By making eggs for breakfast, you can provide your brain with all kinds of benefits. Eggs are a great source of protein, as well as choline, a B vitamin found in eggs. Choline improves brain function and memory, while protein stabilizes your blood sugar, which will help you concentrate. Scramble, boil, or cook your eggs sunny side up. Omelets, made with vegetables like spinach, broccoli, and tomatoes, are a great way to provide nutrients to your brain in the morning. For example, spinach and broccoli are great sources of vitamin B. Try adding a side of avocado or guacamole to your eggs. Avocados are a healthy, monounsaturated fat. Monounsaturated fat contributes to healthy blood flow, and a healthy blood flow means a healthier brain."

          "headline":"Drink tea or coffee.",
          "description":"Tea and coffee contain caffeine. By drinking tea or coffee you can get the benefits of caffeine for your brain, which are enhanced memory, focus, and mood, as well as the benefit of healthy antioxidants. Antioxidants promote healthy blood flow. Drink black tea, green tea, or any other tea that suits you. You can drink your tea either hot or cold; no matter the method, you will still get the same benefits. Drink a cup of tea or coffee per day. If you want, you can also drink two cups of tea per day. Avoid drinking too much tea or coffee, however. Drinking too much tea or coffee can cause you to urinate often."

          "headline":"Eat whole grains.",
          "description":"Whole grains, such as oatmeal and whole grain breads, promote cardiovascular health. By having good cardiovascular health, you are promoting blood flow to your organs, including your brain. Whole grains also provide your brain with energy in the form of glucose in your blood. By adding whole grains to your diet, you are ensuring that you get a constant flow of energy to your brain. This ensures focus and concentration. Opt for whole grain toast, muffins, and oatmeal when planning what to eat for breakfast."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Include blueberries, grapes, and apples in your fruit medley.",
          "description":"Blueberries, grapes, and apples are shown to promote brain health. Because blueberries are rich in antioxidants, tannins, and phytochemicals, they are especially good for promoting brain health. Studies show that blueberries improve learning, thinking, and memory. Grapes are a great source of antioxidants and are shown to counteract oxidative stress and prevent age-related brain diseases. Apples are a great source of quercetin, an antioxidant that helps protect brain cells from free radical attacks. Eat an apple with the skin on after you finish eating your eggs or oatmeal. Add blueberries and grapes to your yogurt, oatmeal, smoothies, and muffins. For added benefits, add almonds to your blueberry oatmeal as well. Almonds are a great source of vitamin E, protein, fiber, and healthy fats; nutrients that prevent cognitive decline. These nutrients also help your body maintain your blood sugar levels, which helps with focus and energy."

          "headline":"Eliminate sugary breakfast foods.",
          "description":"High amounts of sugar have been shown to spike your blood sugar levels, which ultimately slows down the function of your brain and decreases focus. Avoid sugary breakfast foods like bright, sugary breakfast cereals, i.e., fruit loops, cocoa puffs, and cinnamon toast crunch. Also avoid toaster pastries, like pop tarts and toaster strudels. Other sugary breakfast foods to avoid are doughnuts, pastries, Nutella, sweetened yogurt, waffles, and pancakes. Eat healthier versions of these foods by making your own healthy substitutes. For example, you can make healthier pancakes by substituting the flour with oats and cinnamon, and by reducing the amount of sugar you put in the mixture or how much syrup you pour on top. You can also make your own muffins and pastries with whole grain flour instead of white flour, and sweeten them naturally with fruit, like blueberries."

          "headline":"Avoid processed fruit juices.",
          "description":"Processed fruit juices such as, apple, orange, grape, cranberry, and other juices, are shown to have high levels of sugar, and sometimes even higher than soda. Instead, make your own natural fruit juices. For example, squeezing fresh oranges in the morning is a healthy alternative. Make sure to limit juice to 4-6 oz per day, even when it is fresh squeezed. You won't benefit from the fiber in fruit if you are only drinking the juice."

          "headline":"Watch out for processed gluten-free breakfast foods.",
          "description":"Gluten-free diets have become very trendy in the last couple of years, but there is no reason to eat gluten-free unless you have celiac disease. However, consuming many of the gluten-free processed breakfast foods can cause potential problems. For example, rice, potato, and tapioca flour replace the wheat flour in these products. These flours are shown to have a high glycemic index. This means they raise blood sugar rapidly. A rapid rise in blood sugar can cause an insulin spike and a resulting sugar crash. The side effects of a rapid rise in insulin are hindered focus, memory, and brain function. Watch out for gluten-free pancakes, muffins, and other baked goods."

A balanced diet consists of a diet that is 45 percent carbs, 30 percent protein, and 35 percent healthy fats like avocados and nuts. Make sure you eat a balanced diet by eating a combination of oatmeal or whole grain bread with eggs, fruits, nuts, or avocados for breakfast."

          "description":"Buying fresh ingredients will ensure that you cook more often. By cooking more often, you will spend less money on pre-packaged, processed foods. To cook more often, set a cooking goal for yourself. Tell yourself that you will cook a fresh breakfast at least 3 times a week, for example. This can include cooking eggs, making oatmeal or an omelet, or even quiche for breakfast. You can also prep your breakfasts the night or weekend before to save time. For example, you can bake your own whole grain muffins on Sunday night so you can have them available for the week ahead. Try making overnight oats. Soak your oats in any kind of liquid, i.e., milk or yogurt, overnight. The oats will absorb the liquid. The most common method is equal parts rolled oats and milk or yogurt (or a combination of milk and yogurt)."
