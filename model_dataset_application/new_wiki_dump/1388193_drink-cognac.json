If you don\u2019t have a tulip glass, balloon glass, or wobble snifter, use a regular wine glass instead. Tulip glasses are long, bell-like wine glasses. This shape allows the aromas to concentrate on the surface of the cognac. Balloon glasses have a large body and a short stem. These glasses allow you to evenly warm the cognac. Wobble glasses look like stemless balloon glasses. These glasses are hard to set down, forcing you to hold the cognac in your hand and bring it to temperature."

The more cognac you examine and drink, the more easily you will be able to identify quality cognac by sight. Light, one-dimensional straw colors indicate a younger cognac. Dark, layered colors with notes of gold and amber indicate an older cognac. The richer color comes from a longer maturation time in a cask."

With practice, you will be able to easily identify a high-quality cognac by smell. Younger cognacs have strong floral or fruity notes with a hint of spice. Older cognacs have many layers of smells. For example, an expensive cognac might have a deep spicy smell with subtle notes of vanilla and nuttiness."

Once you have thoroughly tasted the cognac, you can swallow it. Continue drinking the cognac one sip at a time, examining the flavors of each mouthful. Less expensive cognacs often have strong fruity flavors such as raisin, apricot, orange or lemon. Mid-range cognacs can have floral rose or clover notes. Expensive cognacs have a variety of flavors, but usually include spiced notes such as nutmeg, cinnamon, or coffee."
