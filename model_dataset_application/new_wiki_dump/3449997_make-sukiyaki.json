The shirataki shouldn\u2019t need much cooking. Rather, the par-boiling is designed to remove some of the odor from the noodles. Then the shirataki can absorb the full flavor of the sukiyaki sauce. If using other kinds of noodles, look at instructions and par boil until they are only a couple minutes away from being al dente."

Place the beef in the freezer for a couple of hours if you want to slice the beef yourself. When hard but not completely frozen through, beef is much easier to slice very thin."

If you were able to get the shiitake, here's how to traditionally prepare them:\nRemove the stem from the shiitake with a knife. Score a small star or cross into the cap of the mushroom with a knife. Imagine a straight line going through the middle of the cap. Take a knife and make a 30\u00b0 angled cut along this straight line, digging only a small amount of flesh from the mushroom, enough to show the whites. Angle the knife in the opposite direction and make another 30\u00b0 cut along the other side of the line. Repeat this process at the perpendicular to make a cross, and once more to make a star. For enoki mushrooms, simply wash and cut off the root bulb to prepare."

  "text":" Preparing the Ingredients Prepare the shirataki by bringing the shirataki noodles to a boil after placing in a pot of cold water.

If substituting spinach or watercress, rinse thoroughly and separate the leaves from the stalks. Discard the stalks. Make the sukiyaki sauce. In a pot, bring 1/2 cup sake, 1/2 cup mirin, 1/3 cup soy sauce, and 1/4 cup sugar to a boil over medium heat. As soon as boil is reached, remove the sukiyaki sauce from the heat. The goal is to burn off the alcohol from the sake, not reduce the sauce. Making Sukiyaki Heat a large hot pot over medium heat. The traditional way of cooking sukiyaki involves an earthenware or cast iron hot pot with a kerosene burner underneath. This way the chef can cook at the table where he intends to serve. Alternately, an electric pan can be put to great use to cook at the table as well. If you have neither a hot pot or an electric pan to cook with, you can of course cook the sukiyaki on the burner away from the table. Just make sure to choose a large pot with an accompanying lid. Place a healthy dollop of beef suet, lard, or other fat in the pot. Beef suet is traditional, but lard or even vegetable oil can be used if the aim is a healthier meal. Introduce the thinly sliced beef into the pot and cook until it just loses its pinkness. You will keep the beef in the pot while the other ingredients cook, so be careful not to overcook it.

Other cooks prefer sweetening the beef a little with plain sugar while it\u2019s frying in the pan with the fat. There's no reason you can't do both. Introduce the cabbage stalks, yaki tofu, and mushrooms into the pan. Keep all ingredients separate; each separate ingredient should be bunched together on the pan. Place the strained shirataki in the pot well away from the beef. Since shirataki contains a compound that makes beef tough, segregate it from the beef while all the ingredients are cooking. Finish placing the remaining ingredients in the pot. Introduce the cabbage leaves, chrysanthemum, and onions into the remaining spots of the pot. Add the remaining sukiyaki sauce and cover the pot to simmer.  Simmer with the lid on for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the meat has fully cooked and the cabbage stalks just lose their crunch.  Serving Sukiyaki Prepare a dipping sauce by beating one egg for each person being served. Traditionally, a dipping sauce of raw eggs is served alongside sukiyaki. The combination may not sound especially appetizing to westerners, but it is a surprisingly good combination, even if you aren\u2019t predisposed to liking it. If you are worried about uncooked eggs carrying salmonella or don\u2019t like the flavor, omit them. For what it\u2019s worth, salmonella is very rare in raw eggs. Dip meat and vegetables into raw eggs before eating. Simply grab whatever looks appetizing out of the hot pot and dip it into the egg. If you are not eating with family or close friends, use the thicker ends of your chopsticks to grab food out of communal pots. This is considered polite. Continue adding any extra meat and vegetables into the hot pot as you eat. If there are leftovers that didn\u2019t find into the first generation of the meal, cook them now in the remaining broth. Meat and leafy greens will take less time to cook than vegetables will. If any broth is leftover, reserve it and serve udon noodles with it the next day. In Japan, it is traditional to use the leftover broth as the broth for udon noodles. If you don't have enough broth but wish to make more, use the recipe for sukiyaki sauce above and combine it with the remaining sauce. Heat the broth back up to boiling, then reduce the heat to a simmer. If the broth tastes too overpowering, cut the broth with 1/3 cup of water and taste again.",
