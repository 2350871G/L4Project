Then, carefully place the orchid into the new pot. If possible, pick a pot designed for orchids. If you can\u2019t find one, opt for a pot with lots of drainage holes to allow air to flow in and water to drain out. Put a saucer underneath the pot to catch excess water. If the roots of your orchid begin growing out through the holes in the bottom of the pot, that\u2019s an indication that the pot is too small and you should move it to a larger one.Tip: Choose a pot that\u2019s just large enough for the roots of the orchid to fit in. You want them to be snug in the pot so they are held together, but don\u2019t pick a pot that\u2019s so small that you have to stuff the roots into it."

Fill the space around the roots with the medium and add a light layer on top, but be sure you don\u2019t cover the leaves. Orchids need well-draining media with lots of air pockets in order to flourish. Avoid using regular potting soil in orchid pots."
