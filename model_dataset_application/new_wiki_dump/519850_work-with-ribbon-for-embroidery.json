Pure silk ribbon is often a suggested preferred ribbon but there are other good quality ribbon types available, including rayon, satin etc. Cheaper ribbon from bargain stores may not be worth the savings in the long run; their fabric content can be questionable and the color might bleed if it becomes moist."

      "headline":"Use the correct needle.",

      "headline":"Work with short ribbon lengths.",
      "description":"Ribbon tends to fray easily, hence it is better to work with it in shorter lengths so that it does not have to pass through the fabric too often. A good length to adopt is 30 centimeter (11.8 in) / 12\" long. This will provide adequate length to work with, without tempting fraying."

      "headline":"Start each ribbon length by leaving a small tail of about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) / 3/8\" long at the back of your work.",
      "description":"Again, finish off with the same amount at the back each time. Stitch these tail ends at the end by sewing a thin embroidery thread through them from one end to the other or by letting embroidery stitches on the rest of the work sew through them. This will keep them in place without leaving bumps under your work."

    {
      "headline":"Don't hold the thread or ribbon too tightly.",
      "description":"Work with a loose tension when embroidering using ribbon. This will help to keep the shape of your stitches and won't pull the ribbon out of shape, threatening fraying."

      "headline":"Prevent the ribbon from twisting as you work.",
      "description":"Do this by making each stitch on the fabric and holding that in place with your thumb, and pulling the ribbon through at the same time."
