          "description":"Perhaps the best step you can take to help get in the habit of eating breakfast is making it the night before. One easy, healthy option is making oatmeal in the evening. In the morning, you can eat it cold or reheat it. Mix in nuts, fruit, or a handful of raisins and a bit of cinnamon. Oats are a great breakfast food, as they are high in fiber and will keep you feeling full well into your day. Whole grain muffins are another good quick grab-and-go option. Make a big batch to last you through the week - and even longer if you freeze some. You can even do the prep work for a quick omelet ahead of time by whisking the eggs and chopping the veggies ahead of time and storing them in the fridge overnight."

          "description":"Whether you prefer to change up your breakfast day to to day or eat the same thing everyday, planning ahead will help you establish a routine. If you like to vary your meals, make a weekly plan so you can get everything you need and have it at the house. If you know you like to eat the same thing every day, stock up on what you need. For instance, have a backup tub of Greek yogurt and an extra bag of granola on hand in case your current supply runs out."

          "description":"For those days when you do wind up running a bit behind, store food at work so you don\u2019t have to go without breakfast. Definitely store a few items with stable shelf life in your desk or locker. Good options include a jar of peanut butter, protein bars, and dried fruit. If you have access to a refrigerator, consider storing protein shakes and cheese sticks in it."

While this is entirely understandable, it\u2019s important to recognize that you\u2019ll be more productive during the day if you kick start your metabolism with at least a small breakfast in the morning. Good quick options include a handful of almonds, a whole grain English muffin, a hard boiled egg, or fresh fruit with reduced-fat cottage cheese or Greek yogurt. You could keep a box of Cliff bars or a similar prepackaged bar in the car if you find yourself rushing out the door every morning."

          "description":"If the reason you tend not to eat breakfast everyday is because you\u2019re in a rush to get out of the door, you need to adjust your schedule. Get up ten to fifteen minutes earlier to give yourself a chance to start your day more calmly - and with the opportunity to eat something as well."

If you like to exercise in the morning, it's important to eat something - even if only a piece of fruit, before your workout. Exercising will also increase your appetite\nOne great option for those who don\u2019t wake up hungry is a smoothie. Not only will a smoothie give you the health benefits of eating breakfast, they can also be made to be especially nutritious. The specific ingredients in a breakfast smoothie are up to you. Use plenty of fruits and veggies, and consider using a liquid dairy alternative as the base, such as almond milk. Include powdered protein or seeds for additional vitamins and nutrients. If you start the day with something small and then exercise, be sure to eat a more substantial meal within two hours after you work out."

This, in turn, can help you feel hungrier in the morning. For maximum effectiveness, open your blinds all the way as soon as you wake up and enjoy the sunlight while you\u2019re getting dressed and preparing for the day.

Perhaps the easiest option is cereal - but read the nutrition facts. Beware of misleading portion sizes and high amounts of sugar in many cereals. Check the nutritional label of any cereals and only go with options that have whole grains listed as the first ingredient.

Unfortunately, if you ride the caffeine train all day and don\u2019t eat much, you\u2019re metabolism will slow down, and you\u2019ll risk storing a bunch of fat following an evening meal - which is likely to be larger than necessary if you hadn\u2019t eaten all day. Further, you may be setting yourself up for failure by trying to get by on coffee alone.
