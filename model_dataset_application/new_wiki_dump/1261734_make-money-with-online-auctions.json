      "description":"If you have your own crafts or items to sell, that's great. But if you want to sell consumer goods, you'll want to buy them from elsewhere and re-sell them through an auction. The key is to balance your outgoing and incoming money so you make a profit; buy low and sell high. Let's assume that you want to sell Nokia mobiles and you have found them for $42 including shipping, on Amazon, now you need the research: search on the internet to see what is the price range for that item, and let's assume that the prices are from $40 to $60. Read carefully the quantity available, and all the details for the product you found (location, dispatch time, description); you will need to reproduce that exactly in your listing and to make sure that you won't remain out of stock when you still have your opened auction for that product. Let's say that you will sell the product for $55, using PayPal, and you have received the payment from your customer. Now go and buy the phone from Amazon and you will earn a $13 profit (from which you will have to pay your auction fees and your PayPal fees) so this means that  you will remain with a profit of around $7-8, depending  on the auction website you are using. If you sell at least 3 pieces a day you will have $24 in your pocket, but you can sell more"

Use everything you can to share your auction links: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit and so on\nChoose your words carefully when you list your item and when you post about it.
