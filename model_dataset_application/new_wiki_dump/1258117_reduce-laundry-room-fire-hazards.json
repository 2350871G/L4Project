Before you start a load of laundry, make it a habit to pull out the lint filter and wipe it clean. You also need to check around the vent pipes and ducts to make sure that they stay clear of lint. Don\u2019t throw the lint on the floor because it will continue to be a hazard; instead, take it to the trash can or keep a small can for lint in the laundry room. Pop off the vent where it hooks into the dryer to check for built-up lint. Lint is so flammable that it\u2019s a common ingredient in fire-starting recipes. Keeping your lint filter clean will also allow your clothes to dry faster. If you live in an apartment building with a shared laundry facility, ask your landlord if they can post signs reminding people to clean the lint filter."
