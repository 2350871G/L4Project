  "text":" Dress Up Your Porch with Flowers Place pots or hanging baskets of flowers on your porch. You can decide on a color scheme that complements your home's exterior, or you can choose an assortment of your favorite flowers and plants. Put potted plants on a set of shelves or a festive outdoor table if your porch cannot accommodate hanging baskets.  Use flowers and potted plants to fill in empty or hard to reach spaces, such as the corner of the porch where nothing else will fit. Or, try placing a tall potted plant between two chairs if there isn't enough space to accommodate a small table.

Choose a large area rug if your porch can accommodate one. Make sure it is slip-resistant and made for outdoor use. Put a rug or straw mat underneath a coffee table or end table.
