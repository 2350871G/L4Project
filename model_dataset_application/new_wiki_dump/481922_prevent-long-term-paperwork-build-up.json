There are several possible approaches to this, depending on what suits you best:\nClean out a file a day. Every working day, clean one file. Even if all you toss is one irrelevant thing, that is better than ignoring it. Ring a regular monthly calendar date and clean out all the files on this date. Any longer than monthly and it will seem an impossible and undesirable chore, so this is probably the longest to leave it. Set aside some time and toss what is no longer actionable, and pin together things that have to be kept for records management purposes to be placed in \"deeper storage\". Avoid using this deeper storage as an excuse not to face things; only tax receipts etc. should be kept this way."
