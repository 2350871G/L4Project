Do a test and run some water from the sink into a clear glass. Set the glass down and check it after a few minutes. If the cloudiness disappears in a few minutes, air bubbles were to blame. You can safely drink this water. If the cloudiness doesn\u2019t disappear, there may be something else causing the problem."

If your water is cloudy from air bubbles, try flushing the tap and letting the warm water flow out. When cold water begins flowing, it should have no air bubbles. If you use this method, save this water by putting a pot under the faucet while you flush the tap. You can then use this water for cleaning or watering your plants."
