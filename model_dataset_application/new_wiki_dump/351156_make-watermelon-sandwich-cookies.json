  "text":" Make the Frosting Combine all of the ingredients for the frosting in a mixing bowl.  Beat the ingredients at medium speed with a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment.  Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator until you are ready to assemble the cookies.  Make the Pancakes Preheat a griddle or nonstick skillet and spray it with nonstick cooking spray.  Whisk the flours, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt in a mixing bowl.  Whisk the eggs, buttermilk, vanilla extract and oil together in a separate bowl.  Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients by pushing the dry ingredients against the side of the bowl using a plastic spatula or the back of a large spoon.  Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk them together until they are just combined. Do not over mix them; a few lumps are permissible. Scoop 1/2 cup of pancake batter and drop it onto the hot griddle.  Drop 6 to 7 blueberries onto each pancake.  Cook the pancakes for 2 to 3 minute, or until the surface begins to bubble. You can always lift the pancake with your spatula to sneak a peek and see if the pancake is brown and ready to flip. Turn the pancake using your spatula and cook the second side for about 30 seconds or until it has browned.  Remove your pancakes and stack them on a plate.  Cut out the Sandwich Components Place a pancake on a cutting board. Position a 1-1/2\u201d (4 centimeter) cookie cutter over the upper portion of the pancake. Press the cookie cutter into the pancake to cut out a shape. Leave about 1/4\u201d (6 millimeters) between the cutter and the edge of the pancake so that the cookies have a uniform look. Continue making as many cutouts as you can out of each pancake, moving the cutter along the outer circumference of the pancake and then moving into the interior.  Repeat the cutting process with all of your pancakes until you have about 4 dozen cutouts. Place the cutouts onto a separate plate. You can either keep the pancake remnants to eat later or discard them. Clean the cutting board to remove pancake crumbs from its surface. Dry the cutting board thoroughly. Place a watermelon slice that is about 1/2\u201d to 2/3\u201d thick onto the cutting board and use the same cookie cutter to cut round shapes out of your watermelon. You don\u2019t have to worry about leaving the space between the cookie cutter and the edge of the watermelon because the edge of the watermelon slice will have a smooth look. Continue cutting until you have cut 24 rounds out of your watermelon slices. Place the watermelon rounds on a separate plate. Assemble the Sandwich Cookies Cover the blueberry pancakes with frosting using an offset spatula, cheese spreader or butter knife.  Place a watermelon slice on half of the frosted blueberry pancakes.  Place the rest of the blueberry pancakes, frosting side down, on top of the watermelon slices.  Place the sandwich cookies on a serving plate.  Dust them with confectioner\u2019s sugar before you serve them. ",
