          "headline":"Pour your flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer.",
          "description":"Place 3 and 3/8 cups (420 g) of all-purpose flour and 1/2 teaspoon (2 g) of salt in the bowl of your mixer. Use your dough hook attachment to mix the flour and salt on low speed for 10 seconds."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add your water.",
          "description":"With the mixer running on low, pour 7/8 cups (210 ml) of lukewarm tap water into the mixing bowl. When the mixer fully incorporates the water into the dough and there is no more flour showing, increase the mixer speed to medium. Using hot water will yield dumplings with a thinner skin. This might be desirable if you are frying your dumplings, but it may make the dumplings fall apart if you plan to boil them. Adjust your water temperature for your desired dumpling cooking method and skill level. (Thinner skins may tear more easily when wrapping, too.)"

          "headline":"Knead your dough for 6-8 minutes.",
          "description":"With the mixer on medium, knead the dough until it is a smooth, single mass. The dough will begin to coalesce on the dough hook in the middle of the bowl. This will take approximately 6-8 minutes."

          "headline":"Scrape the dough out of the mixer.",

        },
        {
          "headline":"Form the dough into a ball.",
          "description":"Using your hands, shape the dough into a round ball. If the dough sticks to your hands, dust them with a little extra flour so you can work with the dough easily. If the dough is crumbly and not holding together, add a spoonful of water at a time, incorporating with your hands, until it is one mass. Always try to be conservative when adjusting with water. Less is more!"

        },
        {
          "headline":"Knead your dough for 2-3 minutes, and let it rest again.",
          "description":"When your timer goes off, flour your hands and knead the dough for 2-3 minutes. When the dough begins to stiffen again and provide some resistance as you knead, set it aside to rest for at least 1 hour. Resting your dough for much longer than 1 hour yields a softer dough that is easier to work with, but the wrappers may be less elastic. This may make them more prone to tearing when you try to fill them. Depending upon your skill level, you can decide how long your wrappers should rest. If you\u2019re just starting out, try resting your dough for 1 hour. You can adjust as you see fit next time. After the rest time is complete, your dough is ready to be shaped into wrappers."
