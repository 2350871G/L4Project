Consider using craft paint designed for use on porcelain if you want the original color of the knob to show and you want to paint a design on the knob. Craft paint is available in liquid form that requires you to use a brush and in marker form which may make detail work easier to execute. Look at fabric and wallpaper designs for inspiration. If you want to paint a pattern on your porcelain knob, small scale designs will work best. Plan to use a combination of primer and paint if you want a uniform finish and color on your porcelain knobs. You can use latex, acrylic or oil paint over the primed knob, and this provides you with a greater option of colors and finishes to choose from than if you use porcelain craft paints. You can also use spray paint over primer in addition to brushing on the paint of your choice."

  "text":" Preparing the Knobs Before Painting Wash the porcelain knob or knobs that you want to paint. A clean surface free of dirt and grime will allow the paint or primer to adhere better to the porcelain knob. Remove the screw from the knob and set aside. Wipe the knob thoroughly with soapy water using a lint-free rag. Rinse the knob. Wipe with denatured alcohol. Allow the cleaned knob or knobs to dry. Paint and primer will not adhere to a wet knob. Prepare an area for painting the knob. Make sure there is adequate ventilation and ample room for all your painting supplies. Consider using a piece of craft foam to keep the knob in place during painting. Screw the screw back into the knob or knobs, and push the screw portion into the piece of craft foam until the foam is flush with the bottom of the knob. Choosing a Color Scheme and Design Decide on a color and design for painting the knob. The effect you wish to achieve will influence which painting method you choose for painting your porcelain knobs. Consider using craft paint designed for use on porcelain if you want the original color of the knob to show and you want to paint a design on the knob.

You can use a compass and pencil if you are not comfortable sketching the circle freehand. Divide the circle into quadrants by drawing 1 vertical line and 1 horizontal through the center or the circle. Sketch out the design you plan to paint on the knob. Using Porcelain Craft Paints Gather together any paints you plan to use on the knob. Make sure you have a paintbrush available for each color if you don't want the paint to dry while you are cleaning your brush when you switch colors. Choose soft, natural fiber paintbrushes when using porcelain craft paints. Examples include red sable or squirrel hair quill brushes. Paint the knob. Use your paintbrushes or porcelain craft paint in the marker form to apply the paint to the knob. Allow your work to dry after you finish with 1 color if you are worried about having different colors bleeding together and mixing while you paint. Resume painting with the next color once the first color has dried. Heat your oven to 300 degrees F (148.9 degrees C). Double check your particular brand of porcelain craft paint to make sure this is the correct firing temperature for your paint. Place knobs on an oven safe baking sheet or pan with sides. The sides will keep the knobs from falling off the pan and onto the floor of your oven. Insert the pan into the oven and allow to fire for 30 minutes.  Remove the pan from the oven. Allow the knobs to cool completely before touching them. After firing, the design should be durable and dishwasher safe and will not require a varnish. Using Primer and Paint Apply an oil based primer to the knob or knobs you wish to paint. Oil based primer will adhere better to the glossy surface of a porcelain knob and will be more resistant to scratches. Look for a primer designed for use on glossy surfaces. Avoid using latex primer, as it may scratch off the surface of the knob. Apply primer using a paintbrush or small foam roller. Apply a light coat to ensure a more even coat and smoother results. Allow the primer to dry. Follow the directions on the primer container to determine the number of hours required for the primer to dry completely. Apply an additional coat of primer if needed.

Sand lightly with fine grit sandpaper after the first coat of paint if you are painting the knob a solid color and want to achieve a smooth texture. Apply a second coat of paint.
