Set the oven to 375 degrees (190 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat. Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it\u2019s fully preheated. Most ovens will usually beep or flash a light to alert you."

Set them aside until you\u2019re ready to bake the cookies. You can get away with using only one cookie sheet, but you will likely need to bake multiple batches of cookies. If you don\u2019t have parchment paper or silicone baking mats, you can grease your cookie sheets with nonstick cooking spray or butter."

Blend the ingredients on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy. If you don\u2019t have a handheld or stand mixer, you can mix the butter and sugars together by hand. It will take a little more time and effort, though, so you may want to allow the butter to soften longer to make the process easier."

Continue mixing the ingredients on medium until they\u2019re fully combined, and then set the mixture aside for a moment.

When the ingredients are fully blended, add 3 cups (249 g) of uncooked, quick-cooking oats and stir until they\u2019re fully incorporated. You can also mix in \u00bc teaspoon (.5 g) of ground cloves with the cinnamon if you want to add some extra spice to the cookies.

Baking the Cookies Place the dough on the cookie sheet with a scoop. When the cookie batter is completely mixed, use a large cookie scoop to drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Each ball of dough should measure approximately 2 tablespoons (30 g). The cookies spread while baking, so make sure to place them at least 2-inches (5-cm) apart on the cookie sheet. Bake the cookies until they are lightly golden. Place the cookie sheet(s) in the preheated oven, and allow the cookies to bake until the edges become lightly golden. In most cases, that will take approximately 10 minutes. Cool the cookies on a wire rack. Once the cookies have golden brown edges, remove them from the oven.

Making the Filling Beat the butter for several minutes. Add \u00be cup (170 g) softened unsalted butter to a large bowl, and use a handheld or stand mixer to beat the butter on medium-high for approximately 5 minutes. You want the butter to lighten in color and become fluffy so the cream will be light and smooth. Add the powdered sugar to the butter. Once the butter is light and fluffy, turn your mixer speed to low and gradually add 2 \u00bd cups (313 g) of confectioners\u2019 sugar. Mix the ingredients until the sugar is fully incorporated. Confectioners\u2019 sugar is also known as powdered sugar or icing sugar. Mix in the vanilla extract and cream. When the confectioners\u2019 sugar is completely blended with the butter, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pure vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of heavy cream with the mixer still set at a low speed. Blend the mixture until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated. You can substitute half-and-half or whole milk for the heavy cream, but the cream filling will probably not be as creamy.

Mix it in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) at a time until you reach the proper consistency. Assembling the Cookies Spread some of the filling over half of the cookies. When the filling is ready, arrange half of the cookies so they\u2019re upside down. Use a knife or spoon to spread 1 to 1 \u00bd tablespoons of the cream filling across the cookies. The amount of filling that you should add depends on the size of the cookie. You want to spread the filling nearly all the way to the edges, so a larger cookie requires more cream.
