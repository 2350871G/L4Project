          "description":"Place the spaghetti squash on a cutting board and lay it on its side. Use a sharp paring knife or something similar to cut lengthways down the squash, slicing it into 2 even halves. It is also possible to cook your spaghetti squash without cutting it in half, but this will make it much more difficult to season with herbs and spices. If your spaghetti squash hasn\u2019t been washed beforehand, rinse it under cold water before cutting it in half."

          "headline":"Scoop out the seeds in the center of the squash.",
          "description":"Use a teaspoon or dessert spoon to begin scooping out the hard seeds in the middle of each half of the squash. Lift the seeds out onto the chopping board, being careful not to scoop out any of the flesh of the squash as you do. Spaghetti squash seeds that have been washed and roasted with a little oil and salt make for a great snack. Toast the seeds the same way you would toast sunflower seeds, in a skillet with a little oil until crunchy and brown."

          "headline":"Sprinkle the squash halves with salt and pepper for a light seasoning.",
          "description":"There are very few savory dishes that aren\u2019t improved with the addition of a little salt and pepper. Sprinkle a pinch of sea salt and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper over the flesh of the spaghetti squash to bring out the natural flavors a little more. Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper will bring the best flavor, but ground pepper and any table salt will also work. You don\u2019t need to use a lot of either salt or pepper when seasoning. Roughly 1/2 teaspoon (6 g) of salt and 1/2 teaspoon (2 g) should be plenty for a single squash."

          "headline":"Use oregano, garlic powder, basil, and thyme for an Italian flavor.",
          "description":"If you\u2019re a fan of herby Italian flavors, you could season your spaghetti squash with an Italian herb mix. Either use a pre-made seasoning or combine 1 teaspoon (1 g) each of dried oregano, dried thyme, and dried basil with a pinch of garlic powder. Sprinkle the spices liberally over your spaghetti squash to season it. Once cooked, this goes great with a little grated Parmesan cheese or spaghetti sauce. You could also add 1 teaspoon (5g) of dried rosemary or parsley, and a pinch of red chili flakes for a more complex Italian seasoning. If you're using a pre-made seasoning mix, sprinkle roughly 1 teaspoon (5 g) over each half of the cut spaghetti squash."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Try chili, paprika, cayenne, and onion powder to add a spicy kick.",
          "description":"If you prefer slightly stronger and spicier flavors, try making a hotter spice rub. Combine 1 teaspoon (1 g) each of chili powder, paprika, and onion powder with a pinch of cayenne pepper to sprinkle over your spaghetti squash. If you want your spaghetti squash to be even spicier, add some red pepper flakes or an extra pinch of cayenne pepper. Mix in 1/2 cup (100 g) of brown sugar to the rub to give your squash a barbecue flavor."

          "headline":"Drizzle your seasoned squash with olive oil.",
          "description":"Once you have topped your spaghetti squash with the seasoning of your choice, drizzle the flesh with around 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of olive oil on each side. Use your hands to rub the oil, herbs, and spices into the squash, seasoning it all over. If you don\u2019t have olive oil or don\u2019t like the taste, you could also use a neutral oil such as vegetable or canola oil. For a slightly different flavor, try using melted coconut oil instead. Wear disposable gloves or wash your hands thoroughly after rubbing the oil into your squash. Any leftover cayenne pepper or red chili flakes will be left on your hands otherwise, and it can be very painful if it gets somewhere it shouldn\u2019t!"

          "headline":"Bake the squash at 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) for 40 minutes.",
          "description":"Place the spaghetti squash with the cut side facing down on a baking tray. Put them in a preheated oven at 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) for 35 to 45 minutes to soften the flesh and cook it through. To check if your squash is cooked, push a knife through the skin and into the flesh. If it goes in and out without any resistance, it\u2019s a sign that your squash is cooked perfectly."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Shred the flesh and serve the squash.",
          "description":"Once the squash is cooked through, use 2 forks to begin shredding the flesh until it separates into spaghetti-like strands. Toss the strands together to distribute the seasoning and serve it immediately. You can either serve your spaghetti squash in a bowl, or you can use the squash skin as a simple bowl for a slightly more rustic look that also saves on dishes. For extra flavor, drizzle over an extra 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) olive oil or grate Parmesan over the squash. You could also add more seasoning by tossing the spaghetti squash with a sauce of your choice."

Put the squash in an oven preheated to 425 \u00b0F (218 \u00b0C) and leave it to cook for 35 to 45 minutes.

Take care not to scoop out any of the flesh while removing the seeds. The squash will be hot once you take it out of the oven, so it may be easier to wait for 5 to 10 minutes for the squash to cool before you cut into it. Roasted or toasted spaghetti squash seeds make for an excellent snack.
