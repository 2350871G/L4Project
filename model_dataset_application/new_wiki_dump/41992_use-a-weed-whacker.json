          "description":"A weed whacker is a power tool and can cause serious injury if the wire comes into contact with you. Sturdy, close-toed shoes will protect your feet from injury, while work gloves and glasses will protect your hands and eyes from flying debris that the machine will kick up. Gloves will also keep your fingers and palms from becoming sore from holding the weight of the weed whacker. You can typically buy this type of protective gear at any store that sells weed whackers. For even more protection, wear a sturdy pair of jeans or work pants to guard the bottoms of your legs.Warning: Weed-eating may take more time than you might expect. If you\u2019re working out in the heat, wear a sun hat as well and be sure to stay hydrated as you work."

          "description":"Large rocks or hard objects will wear down your nylon cutting wire very quickly. Remove small- to medium-sized objects from your work area before you begin trimming. If a rock or object is too large to be removed, use the weed whacker very slowly and conservatively around it in order to avoid damaging your nylon wire. Small rocks can also be kicked up or tossed around by the weed whacker, so it\u2019s important for your own safety to avoid them as well."

Keep the power cable behind you at all times when using the weed whacker to minimize the chances of accidentally cutting it. If you\u2019re using a gas-powered device, this isn't applicable. Before you begin trimming, check to make sure that your power cable stretches as far as needed to do a complete job. If it doesn\u2019t, connect the cable to an extension cord."

When you release this trigger, the weed whacker automatically shuts off. Check the owner\u2019s manual for your particular device to locate this kill switch or to confirm that your device doesn\u2019t have one. If your weed whacker doesn\u2019t have this type of throttle, make sure you know how to safely turn off the device before you begin using it."

Be sure to use a gas-powered weed whacker in an open area with plenty of ventilation to avoid breathing in too much of these fumes. You don\u2019t have to worry about fumes if you\u2019re working with an electric weed whacker."

Never place a hot engine in a storage room or near flammable materials. For best results, leave the weed whacker to cool off in the shade rather than in direct sunlight. Store the weed whacker by placing it on a shelf, hanging it vertically on the wall, or simply laying it flat on the floor of your garage. Be sure to keep the weed whacker away from moisture, open flames, or sparks.Tip: Drain the engine of a gas-powered weed whacker if you plan on storing it for longer than 1 month."

Watch out for any strains in your wrists or back while you\u2019re using the weed whacker. If you notice any strain, stop and rest for a few minutes before continuing. If your weed whacker comes with a shoulder strap, put the straps over both arms and clip the weed whacker to the bottom of the strap to take some of the weight off your arms."

If the grass needs to be leveled out after you finish trimming, break out a lawn mower to finish the job. Try to keep the weed whacker as level as possible when you lower it to the ground. Otherwise, your trimming job will come out uneven."

For instance, if the wire spins in a clockwise direction, move the weed whacker forward from left to right. Use a steady side-to-side motion to cut with the weed whacker as you slowly walk forward. Gently move the weed whacker from side to side without swinging it. This will not only give you better cutting results, but is also much safer.Tip: When you find that the weeds aren't being cut the instant you walk over them, turn off the weed whacker and pull more wire out for use.

Don\u2019t try to cut large swaths of weeds with the whole wire; this may cause the engine to overload. This is especially important if you\u2019re cutting tall, thick, or densely clumped together weeds, since these will be very difficult to cut."
