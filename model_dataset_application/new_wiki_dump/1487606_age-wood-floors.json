      "description":"Hand scraping takes time, but it will age hardwood flooring. Test a small area. Different woods react differently to distressed flooring techniques. Walnut, pine, hickory, pecan and oak work well when you hand scrape them, but hardwoods, such as maple and teak, don't turn out as well with this method. Scrape in the direction of the grain and avoid the knots in the wood. Scraping against the grain will make scratches that go the wrong direction. Adjust the angle and the pressure of the scraping tool to produce the texture you desire. Distressing wood floors is an art form, so use your creativity to achieve the results you want."
