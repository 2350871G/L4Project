You\u2019ll see a heat element in the bottom and a place where the bread pan sits inside the machine. Insert the pan into place, and then place the paddles (sometimes called the  blades) on top of the peg inside the pan. To remove the pan from the machine again, use the handle and give it a gentle pull. The paddle will knead the bread, and the metal pan is what the bread will bake in."

          "description":"Bread machines have different capacities, and some can make small, medium, or large loaves of bread. It\u2019s important to determine the capacity of yours, because you can\u2019t overfill your bread maker. Add one cup of water at a time to the bread pan, keeping track of how many cups you added. Add water until the pan is full. For a machine that holds fewer than 10 cups, you can make one-pound loaves. For a machine that holds 10 cups, you can make 1.5-pound loaves. For 12 cups, your bread can be two pounds. More than 12 cups indicates a 2.5-pound loaf. A small to medium loaf of bread (one to 1.5 pounds) will have around two cups of flour, while a medium to large loaf (two to 2.5 pounds) will be around three cups."

Some flours have a longer kneading and rising time, while others can be put on a rapid cycle. There are some bread maker models that don\u2019t have flour types written right on the machine.

You also likely won\u2019t be able to choose custom settings like crust darkness when you select this option.

For instance, you can put all your ingredients into the machine in the morning, set the delay for five hours, and then your bread will be ready when you get home after work. To use the time delay, use the up and down arrows to add or subtract time from your programmed setting. Once you select your flour type, bread size, and crust setting, your bread machine will give you a cycle time, such as three hours, for example. You can add five hours (so the time display will read eight hours), which means your bread maker won\u2019t start the process until five hours have elapsed. Never use the delay cycle for recipes that contain dairy or other ingredients that should always be refrigerated."
