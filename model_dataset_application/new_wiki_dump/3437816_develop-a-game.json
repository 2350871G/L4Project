          "description":"Before you begin work developing a game, it's important to understand what all needs to go into making a game. Video games have a lot of parts, from the game engine, programming, graphics, animation, to sound and music. All of these take many hours to create. If you've never developed a game before, start simple. Treat your first game as a learning experience rather than a polished project."

          "description":"When coming up with an idea for a game, come up with an idea based around your skills. If you are a great artist but have never coded before, pick a game engine that allows you to focus on your art skills while doing minimal coding. On the other hand, if you are a great programmer, but don't have a lot of art skills, you can create a game with great fundamentals that embraces a simplistic art style. Many popular indie games use simple 8-bit graphics or even just basic shapes for graphics."

          "description":"Video games come in a variety of different styles and genres. One thing they all have in common is they all have a goal. Some games have multiple goals and optional side missions. However, plenty of games have a goal that is as simple as \"Get to the end of the level\". Your first game may just be one screen with a dot that you try to navigate to the top of the screen."

Some games have a complex narrative with lots of non-player characters (NPCs) that make the player feel like they are part of a living world. Other games have animations or cut-scenes before the start of a level. Some include a tutorial. Some games simply display text that tells the player what to do."

This can be a puzzle the player has to solve or platforms the player has to jump on or get around. Does your game have enemies? If so, how do they interact with the player? Does your game have levels, or is it an open-world game?"

If you are designing a platformer game, what happens if the player misses the platform? If your game has enemies, what happens when the player touches or is attacked by an enemy? Does the player have a health bar? Is there a scoring system? Perhaps you want to add a time limit to your game? These are rules you need to decide for your game.

This is what makes a game a satisfying experience. Some games have a final cutscene that shows the hero get a reward for their trouble. Some games give the player power-ups or new items. Other games have a complex leveling system that improves the player's stats over time."

Concept art allows you to put your ideas down on paper before you start building them as assets in a game. You'll want to create concept art for all your characters, NPCs and enemies. You'll want to keep the overall art style consistent, so figure out what art style you want before you start building. If your game has multiple levels, you'll want to create a sketch for how each level looks. You'll also want to map out the level design for each level on paper."

It can also contain plot points, character biographies, concept art, as well as level maps and objectives. This helps get your entire team on the same page."

It controls the game physics, collision detection, scripting, artificial intelligence and more. Picking the right game engine depends on your skill level and the needs of your game. Many game engines allow you to download a free version for personal use to test out. Here are a few game engines you can try:\n\nGame Maker Studio 2:  Game Maker Studio 2 is a good place to start if you are a beginner. It focuses on games with 2D graphics. It's one of the easier game engines to learn. Game Maker Studio 2 has a free 30 day trial, and then starts at $39 a year. Unity: Unity is a popular game engine that has been used to create many popular games on PC, mobile, and game consoles including, Angry Birds 2, Cuphead, and Sonic Forces. It is used to create both 2D and 3D games. It has an intuitive user interface that makes it fairly easy for beginners to learn. You can download the Personal Edition which comes with the core features completely free. The Plus Edition starts at $25 a month. Unreal:. Unreal is one of the most popular game engines. It has been used to create many popular games, including the Batman Arkham games, Mortal Kombat, and Deus X. It is a full-featured game engine that supports high-end graphics. It is also one of the more difficult game engines to learn. This makes it more ideal for advanced game developers. A full version of Unreal is free to download, however, you will need to pay a 5% royalty after the first $3000 dollars per quarter for any games you publish using Unreal."

If your not sure how to build something, many game engines have an assets store where you can purchase game assets built by other people. You can also check for tutorials online to learn how to solve problems that may arise during the game development process. Be careful not to add too much content right away.
