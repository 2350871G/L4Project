          "description":"A DSLR camera allows you to change the type of lens you\u2019re using. A super telephoto lens will increase the distance you can shoot with your camera, resulting in a large, detailed picture of the eclipse. To swap out your lens, grasp it at its base, near the body of the camera, and turn it counterclockwise until it releases. Then place the new lens at the base of the camera and turn it clockwise until it clicks into place."

Without it, even the most minute amount of direct sunlight hitting your eye through your camera lens can be damaging. The American Astronomical Society has a list of reputable solar lenses in a range of prices and for a range of camera types. If you can\u2019t afford a solar lens or find one for your camera, make your own! Trace a circle the size of your lens on Baader Astrosolar sheets and cut it out to place over your lens.
