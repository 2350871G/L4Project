  "text":" Steps Choose black cod that is fresh and has transparent, firm flesh that is white. Fresh fish should smell like the sea, without being overly powerful. Do not purchase fish that has a strong aroma or is flaky in texture. Purchase fresh black cod if it is available in your location, otherwise you can buy frozen black cod. Many websites specialize in the sale and shipment of frozen black cod. Store fresh black cod in your refrigerator until you are ready to cook it. Fish should remain in a refrigerated space before cooking to prevent it from developing bacteria. Measure 3 tbsp. (42 ml) of mirin and 3 tbsp. (42 ml) of sake into a saucepan and place it over medium heat. Allow the mixture to boil, and then whisk in 1/2 cup (113 g) of white miso paste until it has also dissolved.  Put 1/3 cup (75.6 g) of sugar into the saucepan and continue whisking over the heat until it is almost dissolved.  Place the marinade into a baking dish to let it cool.  Add 6 skinless black cod fillets to the marinade once it has cooled, and then turn them to coat on all sides.  Put the fish in the refrigerator to marinade overnight.  Turn on the oven to preheat at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and turn the broiler on as well. Rub a grill pan with vegetable oil and then place it in the oven to get hot. Place the fish onto the grill pan when it is hot and cook until it browns, approximately 2 minutes.  Turn the fish over onto a baking sheet and roast for 10 more minutes.  Serve the fish with pickled ginger.  Golden Garlic Black Cod Place a wok over low heat and add 3 tbsp. (42 ml) of cooking oil. Add 2 tbsp. (28 g) of chopped garlic to wok and fry until it becomes golden, then remove the garlic from the wok and place it in a bowl. Coat the black cod in 1 tsp. (5 g) of potato flour. Add 1 cup (225 ml) of cooking oil to the wok and fry the black cod until it retains a golden color.  Remove the black cod from the wok when it is golden and place it on a serving dish.  Pour out all the oil except for 1 to 2 tbsp. (14 to 28 ml), and then add 1 tbsp. (14 g) of light soy sauce, 1 tsp. (5 g) of fine sugar, 1/2 cup (113 ml) of chicken stock and some white pepper to taste to the wok. Heat the ingredients together until the sauce comes to a boil, and then pour the sauce over the fish and top with the fried garlic.  Black Cod with Chinese Mustard Sauce Mix 1 tbsp. (14 ml) of sesame oil with 1 tbsp. (14 ml) of Japanese soy sauce, and then brush the mixture over the black cod steak. Put the black cod steak on a preheated grill for 7 to 8 minutes per side.  Combine 1 tbsp. (14 ml) of Japanese soy sauce, 1 tbsp. (14 ml) of honey, 1 tsp. (5 g) of dry mustard and 1 tsp. (5 ml) of mirin in a bowl. Stir the sauce then allow it to sit until the black cod is finished cooking.  Place 3 to 4 tbsp. (42 to 56 g) of sesame seeds in another bowl. Eat the black cod by first dipping it into the sauce, then into the sesame seeds. ",
