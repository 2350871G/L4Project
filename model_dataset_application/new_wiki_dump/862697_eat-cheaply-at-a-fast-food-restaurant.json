Whether it's toppings, condiments or a \"free\" side (like peanuts at Five Guy's), loading up on these while spending a minimum on ordered items can fill you up for less.

If you want extra cheese and have slices at home, add them yourself. You'll be saving yourself a lot of money over a long run in exchange for a slight amount of effort."
