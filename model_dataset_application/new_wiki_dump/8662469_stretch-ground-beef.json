          "description":"There are a variety of foods that you can mix in with ground beef to help stretch it. However, dry extenders, such as breadcrumbs and oats, require some type of binder to help hold the mixture together for burgers, loafs, or balls. Eggs are an ideal option because their proteins can easily hold the meat mixture together when heated. As a general guideline, use 1 egg for every \u00bd pound (227 g) of ground beef that you\u2019re mixing an additive into in order to stretch it. You can use egg substitute in place of the egg if you prefer. You can also replace every whole egg with two egg whites if you prefer."

        {
          "headline":"Mix in breadcrumbs.",
          "description":"One of the most common extender for stretching ground beef is breadcrumbs. They work especially well in meatballs and meatloaf, but you may enjoy them in burgers as well. Some recipes call for mixing equal amounts of breadcrumbs and ground beef when trying to stretch the meat. However, that may alter the texture more than you\u2019d like. Start with a smaller amount and only add more if you need to stretch the beef further. White breadcrumbs work fine for stretching ground beef, but wholewheat breadcrumbs are usually a better option."
        },

          "headline":"Work some oats into the beef.",
          "description":"Just like breadcrumbs, whole or rolled oats can help stretch ground beef a little further in your favorite recipe. They mix easily in with the beef and won\u2019t be noticed once you cook the meat. Best of all, the oats are high in fiber so they can help make your meal more filling. In general, use \u00bc to \u00bd cup (23 to 46 g) whole or rolled oats for every pound (454 g) of ground beef. To stretch ground beef in dishes such as tacos, chili, casseroles, and pasta sauces, you can also substitute bulgur wheat, which is a type of whole wheat. A cup (250 g) of cooked bulgar wheat can replace a pound (454 g) of ground beef, so if a recipe calls for two pounds (908 g) of browned ground beef, you can use 1 pound (454 g) of the beef and 1 cup (250 g) of the cooked bulgar wheat."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Include some beans.",
          "description":"For tacos, chili, and casseroles, adding precooked beans to your ground beef can help stretch it. In particular, black and pinto beans mix well with the beef. Brown the beef first, though, and blot the excess grease before adding the beans. In most recipes, you can mix an equal amount of beans and ground beef. If you aren\u2019t a fan of beans, you can mix precooked lentils in with raw ground beef. When they are mixed, you can cook the mixture just as if it was regular ground beef. In general, use 1 cup (75 g) of cooked lentils for every pound (454 g) of meat."

          "headline":"Stir in grated vegetables.",
          "description":"Whether you\u2019re making burgers, meatloaf, or meatballs, mixing some grated vegetables in with the ground beef can make it go further. Grate carrots, zucchini, and onions and mix them in with the raw beef before shaping it. As a general rule, add \u00be to 1 cup (40 to 50 g) of grated vegetables for every pound (454 g) of ground beef. Mushrooms also make a good mix in with ground beef, but you should saute them first so they release their liquid and don\u2019t add too much moisture to the meat. Caramelizing onions before you add them to the ground beef can help add rich flavor to burgers, meatloaf, or meatballs. Other firm root vegetables, such as beets and parsnips, also work well as an extender for ground beef. It may seem strange, but fruit can be a tasty contender  for ground beef. Mix crushed pineapple into meatballs, finely chopped blueberries into burgers, or peeled and shredded Granny Smith apples into meatloaf."

          "headline":"Combine the beef with rice.",
          "description":"If you\u2019re making tacos, chili, or sloppy Joes, you can mix some cooked rice into the beef to help extend it. Brown the meat as you normally would and drain the excess grease before mixing in the rice. As a rule of thumb, add 1 cup (250 g) of cooked rice for every pound (454g ) of ground beef. Both white and brown rice work well as an extender for ground beef."

Add finely chopped fresh herbs such as basil or parsley to the ground beef before you cook it or form it into burgers, meatloaf, or meatballs. Basil, parsley, and cilantro can work well for burgers. Basil, parsley, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and sage can work well for meatloaf. Basil, parsley, rosemary, thyme, and oregano can work well for meatballs."

Season the raw ground beef with spices and dried herbs, such as crushed red pepper or marjoram, before forming it into burgers, meatloaf, or meatballs. Crushed red pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and steak seasoning can work well for burgers.

Parmigiano-Reggiano and pecorino Romano are both ideal options. Parmigiano-Reggiano and pecorino Romano are obviously ideal for mixing into ground beef that you plan to make into meatballs, but you can also use them for burger or meatloaf mixes."

For example, add some ketchup, thick pasta sauce, whole-grain mustard, barbecue sauce, or thai curry paste to your ground beef mixture. Be careful not to add too much of the sauce or condiment. Excess moisture can lead to mushy burgers, meatloaf, and meatballs. Using 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) for every pound (454 g) of meat is a good rule of thumb."

While fatty cuts tend to be juicier, leaner cuts are lower in saturated fat and calories so you don\u2019t have to feel as bad about using them in your recipes. Ground sirloin and ground round are usually the leanest cuts of ground beef that you can get. Ground sirloin has 10 to 14% fat, while ground round has about 12% fat.
