Having your desk in a corner can help you shut out distractions, and you\u2019ll have extra wall space if you want to add shelves to hold your books. A corner desk is a great place to put the family computer if you have kids so you can easily see what they\u2019re doing when they\u2019re online."

Just make sure you measure the space before you purchase your couch to make sure it will fit! You can even find unique sofas and chaises that will fit oddly-shaped corners. If you don't want to use a sectional, you could also place a couch against each wall, with an end table tucked into the corner between them."

A corner television stand will help you make use of an out-of-the-way corner while finding a solution to where to put your TV. You can find corner TV stands that function as an entire entertainment centers, or you can find standalone units if you want the space to look more open. This is a great option for open floor plans, since the furniture arrangement in these spaces is often angled to make the most of the room."

Putting a round table in a corner will allow more people to sit comfortably around the table than you would be able to fit with a square or rectangular table. This is perfect if you want to add a breakfast nook but you don\u2019t have much room."

Pick a plush chair, hang a warm light or place a floor lamp nearby, and add an ottoman. For an extra touch of comfort, keep a plush throw draped over the back of the chair. You may want to add a small side table to the space in case you want a cup of tea while you\u2019re reading! Make it a combination reading nook and conversation space by using 2 chairs and a small side table."

Eventually, someone came up with the idea to build triangle-shaped furniture that would fit in a corner. If you want extra storage, opt for a corner cabinet, but if you want the space to still feel open, a small table will work instead. If you want to take advantage of the height of a room, choose a tall cabinet with a combination of shelves and hidden storage. This would also be a good space to put a corner China hutch.
