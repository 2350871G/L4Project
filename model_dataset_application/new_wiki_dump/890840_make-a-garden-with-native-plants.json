      "description":"You don't want to unintentionally hurt your local ecosystem, so you will need to do some research. Know your Endangered and Threatened Plants. Unfortunately, some plants are threatened, and should not be transplanted for any reason (unless maybe under threat of destruction by development or agriculture ). Even plants that may look ordinary--like ferns--may in fact be off-limits. Check with your areas endangered and threatened species list. Some plants may live and thrive in your area, they may actually be pests. For example, in Vermont, USA, purple loose strife is a beautiful plant, but is an invasive species that hurts the native habitat. Know what local plants are dangerous to have around. For instance, you do not want to start a garden of poison ivy, or encourage highly poisonous plants like nightshade with your baby brother playing in the yard. If you've got pets, make sure you don't grow anything that might be poisonous to them. Most high-quality nurseries can guide you into choosing appropriate native species. Some nurseries have whole sections for \"natives\". It may be possible to buy cultivated versions of \"wild plants\" that should not be re-located. (For instance, trillium or cacti)\nIn the USA, some colleges and universities may have agricultural extension services that can help you. If you are a student, check with your botany or biology teacher...or a teacher who is fond of gardening (there is almost always one in every school)."
