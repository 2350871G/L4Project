If you don\u2019t have your mind set on a specific city, then it helps to understand that there are five distinct regions of the state, one of which might be more attractive to you than the others. The Florida Panhandle: This is home to the state capital of Tallahassee and is known for its beautiful Gulf Coast beaches. Since Tallahassee is only 30 miles (48 km) from the Georgia border, it is known for its Southern charm and friendly people. Northern Florida: This is home to the major cities of Gainesville and Jacksonville. It is known for its culturally Southern atmosphere and historic landmarks. Central Florida: This is home to Disney World, SeaWorld, and the Kennedy Space Center. Aside from the major tourist attractions, there are dozens of quaint small towns dotted with lakes in the region worth considering. Southern Florida: This is the largest metropolitan area of the state and is home to the Everglades, Miami, West Palm Beach, and Key West. Southwest Florida: This is home to Tampa, St. Petersburg, Naples, Sarasota and Ft. Myers. It is known for its museums, arts and theater, as well as its beautiful beaches."
