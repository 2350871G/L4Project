You\u2019ll know the product is working when the foliage begins to grow discolored and deteriorate. It's best to plan your attack for a day with clear, calm weather. A heavy rain may dilute or wash away freshly-spray herbicide. Similarly, strong winds could accidentally carry the chemicals to other healthy plants nearby. Avoid handling or watering neighboring plants for a few days after spraying a chemical herbicide around them."

Trace amounts of herbicide left behind in the soil won\u2019t affect any new growth you go on to plant. Ivy can be sneaky. Look for any spots you may have missed before you declare your mission accomplished.
