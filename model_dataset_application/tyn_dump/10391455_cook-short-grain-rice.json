The water will become cloudy and milky during rinsing. Repeat this process until the water stays clear. You may need to rinse the rice 2-4 times to get all the starch off of it. After you've drained the rice, you may wish to gently rub the grains together between your hands. This can help give the grains a more polished texture. Short grain rice is very starchy, so rinsing can help prevent it from becoming too sticky or mushy during cooking."

          "description":"Once the rice is rinsed, place it in a pot with some cool water. Let the rice sit in the pot with the water for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Soaking the rice can reduce cooking time, help the rice cook more evenly, and improve its texture. Don't let the rice sit in the water for more than 8 hours, or it will become mushy and flavorless. You may find it easiest to soak the rice in the same water that you will use for cooking."

If you wish, you can experiment with slightly increasing or reducing the amount of water if you want rice that is more or less moist. Keep in mind that the rice may increase in volume by up to 3 or 4 times as you cook it. Before you start cooking, decide how much cooked rice you want to end up with, and choose a pan that's big enough to contain it."
