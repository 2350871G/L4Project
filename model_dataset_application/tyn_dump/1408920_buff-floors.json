    "Your motion should swing back and forth like a pendulum.",
    "Move backward as you work so you don\u2019t step on the buffed sections.",
    "This helps you avoid stepping on the parts of the floor you\u2019ve already buffed.",
    "You don\u2019t want to step on the buffed areas because they will be very slippery.",
    "Also, you don\u2019t want to mess up the finish.",
    "Walk slowly so you don\u2019t accidentally trip over your own feet.",
    "Hold the buffer over scratches and scuffs for a few extra seconds.",
    "As you work, look for visible scratches and buffs.",
    "It\u2019s okay to give these areas special attention by holding the buffer over them for a few extra seconds.",
    "Additionally, you can make several passes over them.",
    "If you still notice a scratch or scuff after you finish, you can try hand rubbing it with a soft cloth soaked in buffing solution.",
    "Flip or change the buffing pad if it gets clogged or dirty.",
    "Stop and check the buffing pad every few minutes to see if it looks dirty or clogged.",
    "Additionally, you\u2019ll know the pad needs to be changed if the floor isn\u2019t getting as shiny as it was previously.",
    "Most buffing pads can be flipped once during cleaning.",
    "If your pad looks soaked through, just switch to a new one.",
    "Follow spray buffing with a pass of dry buffing, for best results.",
    "Switch out your red buffing pad for a gray or beige one.",
    "Then, start buffing your floor in the far corner.",
    "Slowly work your way toward the other side of the room.",
    "Your buffing pad likely won\u2019t need changing on this pass.",
    "However, continue to check on it regularly to make sure it\u2019s not clogged or dirty.",
    "It\u2019s best to wait until your floor is dry before you start your dry buffing.",
    "You may want to apply a finish to the floor to reduce slipperiness and increase the shine.",
    "Use a clean dust mop to remove any dust created by the buffing process.",
    "Once your floor is dry, return to the corner of the room and begin making short, even passes with your dust mop.",
    "Continue working your way over the entire surface of the floor until you reach the other side of the room.",
    "This helps get your floor as clean and shiny as possible.",
    "Using a floor buffer can stir dust up into the air, which will then fall back down onto your freshly buffed floor.",
    "A clean dust mop can remove this debris."
