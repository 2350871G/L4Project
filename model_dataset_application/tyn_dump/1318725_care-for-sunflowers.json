However, many sunflowers are daylight-sensitive, and may grow leggy and delay flowering if planted at the wrong time. There are three types of varieties:\nShort-day: These need long nights to trigger flowering. Plant them toward the end of summer (or start them indoors in mid-spring). Long-day: These bloom during the middle of summer. Day-neutral varieties can be planted any time during the growing season. Plan ahead based on the expected flowering time.
