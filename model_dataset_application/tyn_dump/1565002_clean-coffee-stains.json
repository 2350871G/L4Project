          "description":"If the stain is still damp, blot with paper towels or tissue. Use a blotting, up-and-down lifting motion to soak up the coffee. Do not rub the paper towel from side to side because this may spread the stain. Use white paper towels because towels with patterns could leak dye onto the fabric and create even worse stains. Blotting immediately helps remove any excess liquid and some of the chemicals that cause coffee to stain. Blotting will also make your clothes receptive to the other steps."

You may need to do this 2 or 3 times. Rinse the back of the cloth where the stain is located. Do not rinse the top surface of the stain directly yet because rinsing the stained surface may cause the stain to spread."

Make sure the area is still moist before you rub it in. Let the detergent sit for 5 minutes, and then rub it gently again. Now rinse with cold water. Spread the detergent on both surfaces of the coffee-stained material, front and back."

The paste should be the same consistency as toothpaste. Make enough to cover both sides of the stain, front and back. Test a small part of the fabric that cannot be seen with the paste to make sure the paste won't discolor the fabric. Let the paste sit for 5 minutes and then use a nail brush or toothbrush to rub both sides of the stain in a circular motion. Rinse the stain with cold water when you are finished."
