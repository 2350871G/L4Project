The spray-gun is a virtually self-contained sprayer, electrical with a screw- on container for the paint.

Test run the spray on a piece of wood to determine the most suitable tip for the sprayer and the most effective stoke motion.  Spray paint surface with lightly sweeping motions.  Clean spray-gun by spraying a container full of lightly soaped water.  Use an airless spray gun. Use an airless spray gun for larger surfaces, such as indoor and outdoor walls.  Prime the gun, hose, and siphon tube according to sprayer instructions.  Fill a bucket with approximately 2 gallons (7.57 L) of paint.  Adjust the pressure, after dry-run test spray on piece of cardboard or wood, according manufacturer's directions. Pressure is too high if the coverage is thin or there is a lot of scatter. Hold sprayer tip 14 inches (35.56 cm) from the surface and sweep sprayer in easy movements that overlap each sweep by 50%.  Flush spray system with lightly soaped water.  Use an HVLP (High Volume Low Pressure) paint sprayer. Use an HVLP sprayer for surfaces where it is important to avoid streaks. The HVLP, like the Airless Spray Gun, consists of a paint reservoir, a hose, compressor, and gun with a variety of tips..
