Measure these so that they fit each side of the wood, two longer for the longer sides and two for the shorter ones. Also, make sure these are not too thick so they do not invade the space. If desired, a 4 inch (10cm) piece of wood can be cut out of the smaller side to make a gateway. Leave the 10 cm piece of wood to one side."

      "description":"With your 10cm piece of wood, use hinges and screw them onto the smaller side BEFORE gluing down. Once this has been done, screw it onto the gate, making sure they are secure. If hinges are not available, use a toy fence or makeshift one instead, perhaps out of pipe cleaners or lollipop sticks."
