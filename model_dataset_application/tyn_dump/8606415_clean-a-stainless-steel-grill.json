You can use the oven cleaner if the baking soda paste doesn't work. It's not necessary to do both unless your grate is extremely dirty and the baking soda leaves residue behind.

To limit residue on the grate, always preheat your grill before placing food on it. That will help keep items from sticking to the grate.
