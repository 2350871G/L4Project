Joy Cho\t\t\tDesigner & Style Expert, Oh Joy! It\u2019s essential to pay attention to the edges of your frame. You usually don\u2019t want to use paper that\u2019s too thick. Try thinner tissue paper or wrapping paper instead. Start by painting the frame with glue and then apply the paper so that it folds over the edge cleanly and crisply. Trim the edges on the backside and always follow the edges of the frame."

          "description":"This is a good idea if you cover the entire picture frame with a pattern. Sanding the edges of the paper away shows off the wooden frame, and gets rid of any sharp edges or cut lines that make the frame look less professional. Use a low-grit sandpaper. You won\u2019t need to sand too much; you\u2019re only sanding through paper and glue."

This may give your frame a more finished, professional look. Some people like to upcycle pretty party napkins. Decoupage will work best with 2-ply napkins. Trace around designs that you like with a wet artist\u2019s brush, and use the wet lines as perforations to tear out your pieces. Keep in mind that you will have to glue these pieces later. Don\u2019t make your cutouts so intricate that they will tear when they are being glued."

If you are using very delicate paper, apply glue to the frame, and then apply the paper to the glue. If you are applying the paper to a frame with molding, you can go over the top of the pieces with a wet artists\u2019 brush and use a stippling motion to better accentuate the molding."
