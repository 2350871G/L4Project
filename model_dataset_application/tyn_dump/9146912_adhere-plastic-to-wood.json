One of these products will give you more lasting results than ordinary types of glue. If you\u2019re working on something that requires a lot of assembling, stock up on multiple tubes. It never hurts to have a little extra super glue on hand. Some types of porous wood may absorb regular super glue before it bonds with the plastic. If you're working with a porous wood, look for a gel-based super glue."

          "description":"Go over the broadest area of the plastic piece with a square of high-grit sandpaper before you get gluing. Sanding the plastic will make it more porous and increase its overall surface area, allowing it to bond to the wood more easily. Use only a few smooth, delicate strokes to avoid roughing up the plastic too much. If there's a chance you might damage the piece you're sanding, it may be better to skip this step."

This removes excess dust and oils, and helps pull out any remaining moisture. To avoid oversaturating the wood, wring the excess water out of the cloth after wetting it. Applying the glue while the wood is still damp may weaken its ability to hold."

To check to see if you\u2019re ready to begin gluing, squeeze the trigger lightly and look for melted glue strings to emerge.

    "Find an out of the way place to let the adhesive set up.",
    "It should dry to the touch within about 5 minutes, but it may take as long as 20 hours for it to cure completely.",
    "Try not to touch either piece too much in the meantime, if you can help it.",
    "Epoxies solidify as they dry, which makes for a longer-lasting connection, even in wet conditions.",
    "The drying time of a particular brand of epoxy will usually be listed on the packaging.",
    "Using Contact Cement Use the proper safety gear.",
    "Always wear gloves and eye protection when working with contact cement.",
    "It might even be a good idea to don a respirator if you have sensitive airways.",
    "Since it contains potent chemicals, you'll want to limit direct exposure to the adhesive as much as possible.",
    "Short-sleeved or snug-fitting clothing is a must.",
    "You don't want to accidentally drag a sleeve through industry-grade adhesive!",
    "Contact cement is most often used in construction and industrial projects.",
    "Due to its involved application process, it isn\u2019t the best choice for arts and crafts or minor repair jobs.",
    "Instead, it's useful for activities like applying Formica to countertops.",
    "Work in a well-ventilated space.",
    "Contact cement emits flammable fumes which may be unsafe to breathe.",
    "Set up your materials outside, if possible.",
    "If you\u2019re confined to an indoor workshop, open a door or crack a couple of windows and keep a fan running to allow the fumes to escape.",
    "If your project is taking a while, take frequent breaks to limit your exposure to fumes.",
    "Roll or brush the contact cement onto both pieces.",
    "Spread a thin coat across the entire surface, being cautious evenly cover the edges, but not to let the cement overlap them.",
    "Contact cement only sticks to itself, so it will be necessary to apply it to both pieces.",
    "When the adhesive is sticky to the touch but doesn't rub off on your fingers, it will be ready for joining.",
    "Use the smallest amount of adhesive possible.",
    "Before you start brushing on the contact cement, clean both surfaces thoroughly.",
    "Contaminants on your project surface can affect your bond and create an uneven surface.",
    "Use spacers to help align your materials.",
    "Arrange a series of dowels or scrap wood across the bottom piece and set the other piece on top.",
    "This will allow you to make minute adjustments.",
    "Once you\u2019ve got the pieces where you want them, slide the spacers out one by one.",
    "Spacers will come in handy when joining pieces with precise edges, such as countertops or laminate and substrate.",
    "The cement won\u2019t bond to the spacers because they don\u2019t have any adhesive on them.",
    "Apply direct pressure to the joined pieces.",
    "Go over the top piece with a roller, or tap it lightly all over with a rubber mallet or similar object.",
    "This will complete the bonding process and help form a stronger connection\u2014no extended drying time required.",
    "If you don\u2019t have any other tools on hand, you can use a piece of lumber wrapped in a towel to flatten the top piece and work out bubbles and other inconsistencies.",
    "Correct mistakes with a clothes iron.",
    "The heat of the iron will reactivate the cement, making it pliable again.",
    "Run the iron over the area that needs fixing for a few seconds until the pieces begin to lose their hold.",
    "Then, adjust them carefully by hand and leave them to dry.",
    "Keep the iron on a low-medium setting to avoid damaging either surface.",
    "Clean up accidental drips, streaks, and smudges using lacquer thinner."
