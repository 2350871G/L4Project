Use stapling in addition to the adhesive, or consider not using the adhesive at all if you're concerned about its potential damage to the coin.\u2022Use a pair of pliers to gently squeeze and flatten the two prongs of the staple that get folded at the back of the coin holder. This will ease sliding the coin holders in and out of the pockets of 8.5 by 11 inch clear plastic coin holder sheets."
