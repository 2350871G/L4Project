          "description":"Fold a piece of Kydex over the knife blade so you can make the sheath out of a single piece. Trace the outline of the blade on the Kydex with a pencil, adding 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the perimeter. This does not need to be an exact measurement, but it is always better to err on the side of caution and make the sheath bigger than it needs to be. Making the sheath bigger than it needs to be allows you to trim it down when the time comes. If you make the sheath too small, you won\u2019t be able to add Kydex to make it bigger. You don\u2019t want your Kydex sheath to cover the hilt because that will prevent you from taking the knife out of the sheath easily."

Stay safe and wear oven mitts when removing the sheath, as it will be incredibly hot once it comes out of the oven. While you do not need to put the Kydex on a baking sheet, overheating the material can cause it to melt, so constantly monitor the Kydex when it is inside the oven. If you are using a toaster oven, set it to 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C) and let the sheath sit in there for around 5 minutes. The Kydex is ready when the consistency is like leather."

          "description":"Do this within 15 seconds of taking the sheath out of the oven, because Kydex hardens quickly as it cools. Put your knife on top of the Kydex and fold the Kydex over the knife. If you are using 2 pieces of Kydex, put the knife on top of 1 piece and cover the knife using the other piece. If you make a mistake in positioning the knife, that\u2019s okay! You can simply reheat the Kydex again to give it its flexibility and start the process over."

Take a cotton sheet and put it in the foam press first, then put the Kydex sheath with the knife in it into the press. Once you\u2019ve closed the press, keep it on the sheath for about 10 minutes before taking it out. This gives the Kydex enough time to cool. The cotton sheet keeps the Kydex from sticking to the foam and prevents the knife from shifting when you close the press. Make sure that the Kydex has firmed up before moving on the next step. If it has not, keep it in the foam press for another 5 minutes and check again after that time. You can buy a foam press online or at a home improvement store."

If you\u2019re using a machine punch, stick the rivet through the hole and place the Kydex sheath under the punch. Press the rivets in slowly and smoothly to prevent the Kydex from splitting. If you are left-handed, have the outside of the knife handle facing left and punch rivets to the left of the outside of the handle.
