  "text":" Cleaning Silk with More Silk Find a piece of white silk. Be sure the piece of silk you use is white. Never use colored silk to remove a stain. Rubbing your silk with colored silk could cause the colors to transfer during the process of stain removal. Try using a white pillow case. If you cannot find any white silk, you can try a piece of muslin or white cotton. Rub the water mark with the white piece of silk. Lie your stained garment on a flat surface. Gently rub the piece of white silk over the stain to lift the water stain off your garment. Just like colors can transfer, so can the stain.

Always rub with or across the grain. Rubbing at a diagonal will wear out your garment and could cause it to lose its shape. Steaming Your Silk Garment Boil water in a pot on your stovetop. Fill a pot with water and place it on your stovetop. Turn the heat on high until the water comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Hold your garment in the steam for one minute.
