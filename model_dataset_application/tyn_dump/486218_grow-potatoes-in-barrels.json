    "When your potatoes are fully grown, their shoots will sprout flowers.",
    "When their growth cycle is complete, the flowers will turn yellow and brown as they wilt.",
    "Once your flowers are wilted on top of your soil, your potatoes are ready for harvest!",
    "Simply push or kick your barrel over, dig out the potatoes with your hands, and cut off the roots.",
    "This will likely be at the end of August or in September if you started your potatoes in early spring.",
    "Be sure to wash your potatoes thoroughly!"
