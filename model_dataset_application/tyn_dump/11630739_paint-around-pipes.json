          "description":"If the pipes go into the wall at a perpendicular angle, rip off a piece of painter's tape long enough to go around the circumference of the pipe. Stick one end onto the pipe and run it around the pipe, placing the edge of the tape as close to the wall as you can. Repeat this process for each pipe that is attached to the area you're painting. If your tape is thinner than 2 inches (5.1 cm), add another ring of tape to protect more of the pipe. Remove the painter\u2019s tape when the paint is damp so you can wipe away any fresh paint that may have seeped under the tape. Make sure the tape is completely stuck to the pipe to prevent any air pockets where paint can seep under."

Dip the sponge into the paint, blot away the excess, and align the side of the edger with the rounded edge of the pipe. Sweep around the pipe in one direction, slightly turning the edger so the side is right next to the pipe. Depending on how your pipe fits into the wall, you may need to switch hands as you move the edger around the pipe. It may help to think of the pipe as a clockface at the point where it enters the wall. For instance, start the edger at the 1 o\u2019clock position and sweep it to the 6 o\u2019clock position. Then, if you need to, switch hands to start at the 12 o\u2019clock position and sweep down to the 6 o\u2019clock position. As an alternative, use a small, clean kitchen sponge."
