  "text":" Cooking the Ham Thaw the ham well before cooking if purchased frozen. A frozen ham can be thawed in a fridge overnight or soaked in cold water for a few hours. If you bought a cured ham, soaking for a few hours is suggested to remove some of the saltiness. Take the ham out of the fridge two hours before cooking to ensure that it will boil evenly.

Trim the fat to about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) thick. Then make cuts into the remaining fat in a cross-hatch pattern. This will help the glaze seep deeper into the meat. If you\u2019re not glazing your ham, skip ahead to Step 4. Try not to pierce the meat itself when scoring. Make the glaze and spread it over the ham. Cover as much of the top side of the ham as you can. Place the glazed ham in a pan and put it in a pre-heated, 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) oven. Bake for 15 minutes or until the glaze has turned a nice, golden brown. Let the ham rest 20 minutes before carving.

Place the ham in a sealed container and enjoy it again for up to a week afterwards. If you wish to freeze the ham, you can preserve it in a freezer-safe container for up to a month.",
