      "headline":"Prepare the egg.",
      "description":"This recipe requires only one egg, which will make approximately one serving of egg toast. Start by cracking your egg into a large, flat bowl that is wide enough for your bread. Beat the egg continuously until there are no more traces of egg white, and you are left with a cohesive liquid. Make sure you beat carefully and thoroughly so that your dish will be evenly cooked, and taste the same throughout. You can use anything instead of an egg beater that is a decent beating tool, such as a whisk, or even a fork. You can add a pinch of salt for extra flavor, but this is not required to make the dish."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Slice the bread.",
      "description":"Since this delicious dish uses eggs as the main source of nutrition, the bread should not be anything complicated. We recommend you use plain white bread found in your local market, but whole grain should work just as good. The shape of your bread doesn't really matter, but we recommend you cut it diagonally into 2 equal triangles, so you can save some bread. You can cut the crust off, depending on your preference. But note that if you don't like the toughness of the crust, the bread crust softens after cooking with the egg, leaving a soft, crunchy texture throughout."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Prepare the pan.",
      "description":"The pan of this dish should be somewhat larger than the bread, leaving enough room for excess egg mixture, as some of it will separate from your bread. Start the fire or heat the stove top to medium power and let your pan sit there, preheating, for a couple of minutes before you start. Put about 1/2 tablespoon of oil, or butter, onto the pan and spread it around. Be careful so that you don't put too much, or it will get too oily. (You can skip this step if you have a nonstick pan.) If you put too little, your toast may stick onto the pan. The right amount is just a little less than you would use to fry an egg."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Dip your bread.",
      "description":"Before just putting your bread directly into the pan, you will need to dip it in the egg mixture you had prepared earlier. Dip your bread into the bowl you mixed the egg in, it should fit perfectly. Make sure you let the bread soak up the egg, but make sure you don't leave it in so long that it falls apart. Don't dip too much or else you will run out of the egg mixture, and your bread could fall apart. However, make sure you don\u2019t add too little or else it could ruin the taste, and texture of this dish. If you feel like you have prepared too little of the egg mixture, you can crack more as needed."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Put your bread into the pan.",
      "description":"Now that your bread is dipped and wet, you need to put your bread into the pan. Do so by carefully placing it in the middle of the pan. It is perfectly normal if some of the egg mixture drips off your bread and onto the pan, just remember to scrape this up before cooking the next piece to avoid burning. Place carefully."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Cook your bread.",
      "description":"Fry your bread at medium heat until one side is golden brown. The upper side should be light yellow. Check the bottom side every once in a while to make sure it is not burning, but a perfect golden color. Then, flip the bread and do the same for the other side. Be careful not to rip your bread in the process, as the bread will become very soft. (The bread in the picture above has already been flipped)."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Take it out.",
      "description":"When both sides are cooked golden brown, turn off the heat. Carefully take out the bread with a fork or a spatula. Since your bread has just finished cooking, it will still be hot, so make sure you do not touch it. Your savory egg toast is almost done!"
    },
    {
      "headline":"Repeat.",
      "description":"Repeat the previous steps until you run out of egg mixture, or you're satisfied with the amount you have made. Your bread will cook faster after the first slice, since your pan has already been heated."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Flavor it.",
      "description":"Now that all the cooking is complete, you have the option to add some more flavor to it, or just eat it plain. You can add anything you would like. Here are some of the things you can add on top of your bread:\nSyrup (Maple, chocolate, etc.) Condensed Milk\nHoney\nSugar\nJam"
