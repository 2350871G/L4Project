To ensure that the chicken is cooked through, have an instant-read thermometer on hand.

Fill a 6 quart (5.7 L) saucepan with 2-inches (5 cm) of vegetable oil, and heat it over medium high heat. Use a deep fry thermometer so you know when the oil has reached 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius).
