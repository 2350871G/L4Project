Either scrape the label from the plastic jug or use hot soapy water and a scrubbing pad to gently remove it."

      "description":"Depending on how large you want your planter mouth to be, cut either a tighter or larger opening at the neck of the jug or just below it. To cut, use the end of the scissors to stab into the side of the jug before cutting. Once the scissors have a hold, cut around the jug. Cut to remove the top completely. Although you could cut straight around you could also create a wave pattern or even an up and down pattern around the top of the jug. Make sure you are closer to the top of the jug opening so you leave enough room to hold the soil. It might help to mark the are you wish to cut around the jug, to have an easy-to-follow line."

      "description":"While this is optional, it's a chance to be creative or to hand it over to the kids for some garden decorating fun. Get as creative as you wish when decorating your milk jug. You could even \u201cbling\u201d out your jug using faux jewels or cover the jug with fake money for fun. Use tempera paint for the best application if you plan to paint it or you could add on with papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Perhaps create an animal face and then paint it. Use care if applying charms or other items using a hot glue gun. Hot glue and plastic may slightly warp or bend, so use the minimal amount of glue if you plan to use a hot glue gun for application. Consider using Super Glue as an alternative way for application."
