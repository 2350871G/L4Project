Try to get a product that\u2019s made with a citrus base, as this is most effective when wiping off oil-based marks like sticky tack. Try a Magic Eraser if you don\u2019t have stain remover on hand. Test the cleaning product on your walls before you apply it to the stain. If you have a painted wall, it might wear off some of the paint.
