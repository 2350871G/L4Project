Select a pattern that matches up with your skill level and that will allow you to create the desired type of scarf.

For example, you could use a special stitch and a cable needle to create cabling throughout the scarf.Tip: If you want to create a textured appearance throughout your scarf, then you might use an advanced stitch, such as the brioche stitch or the rice stitch."
