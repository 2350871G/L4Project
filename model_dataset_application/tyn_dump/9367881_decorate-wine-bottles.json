After they've dried overnight, touch them with your finger to see if they're fully dry. If they're still wet, let them continue to dry before you cure them. Cure your wine bottles in the oven for 30 minutes. Place your wine bottles in the oven and set the temperature to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Set a timer for 30 minutes, then remove the bottles from the oven. Add decorations to your painted wine bottles. Glue on rhinestones or decorative gems. Add glitter to your painted bottles using an acrylic sealer as an adhesive. You can also hot glue decorative flowers onto the bottles. Make sure you wait to add decorations after you've cured your wine bottles in the oven. Making Wine Bottle Lights Drill a hole at the base of your wine bottle. Use a diamond drill bit designed specifically for glass. Make sure the drill bit is larger than the cord on the string lights you\u2019ll be using. Lay your wine bottle on a flat surface over a towel so it\u2019s steady. Slowly drill down into the base of the wine bottle (on the side, not the bottom of the bottle).

Make sure you use string lights that have a plug on only one side or they won\u2019t fit through the hole.

This will prevent them from sliding back down into the base. Decorating Wine Bottles with Glitter Scratch up the surface of your wine bottle with fine-grit sandpaper. Look for sandpaper with a grade between 120 and 220. Rub the sandpaper over the wine bottle in a circular motion until it\u2019s completely covered with scratches. The scratches will make it easier for the adhesive you\u2019re going to use to stick to the bottle. Set up your work space in a well-ventilated area. Work outside if possible. If you have to work inside, open any windows in the room you\u2019ll be working in and plug in a box fan. Lay down tarp or newspaper on a flat surface so glitter and adhesive don't get everywhere. Lay your wine bottle down on the flat surface. Spray a section of the bottle with a spray-on acrylic sealer. The acrylic sealer will work as an adhesive for the glitter to stick to. Hold the sealer 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from the bottle and spray from the base of the bottle to the mouthpiece. You can find spray-on acrylic sealer at your local crafts store. Sprinkle craft glitter over the sealer. Add the glitter directly from the canister. Completely cover the adhesive with glitter so there aren\u2019t any empty spots. Look for craft glitter at your local crafts store. Turn the bottle and apply sealer and glitter to a new section. Continue to turn the bottle and add more sealer and glitter until the entire bottle is covered. If you notice bare spots, spray sealer over them and cover them with glitter. Spray the whole bottle with sealer to seal the glitter in place. The extra coat of acrylic sealer will help the glitter stay on the bottle. Keep in mind that some glitter will come off the bottle when you touch it. Be careful when you're handling the bottle so glitter doesn't get on your clothes. Wrapping Wine Bottles with Twine Glue the end of a roll of coarse twine to the bottom rim of your wine bottle. Use a hot glue gun so the twine is secure on the bottle. Apply a drop of hot glue to the bottom rim of the bottle (on the side of the bottle) and press the end of the twine into the glue. Let the glue dry for at least 1 minute. Wrap the twine around the bottom rim of the bottle. Add a drop of hot glue every 2 inches (5.1 cm). Stop wrapping the twine once you get back to where you started. Let the hot glue dry for 1 minute. Tightly wrap the twine around and up the bottle until you reach the neck. Don't leave any gaps between the rings of twine as you wrap it around.
