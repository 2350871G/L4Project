Then, use a molding adhesive to hold the crown molding in place as you fasten it with 18 gauge finish nails.\" Hold the bottom of the crown to the saw fence and the top of the crown to the saw bed. Place the bottom of the crown, or the part that will touch the cabinet, to the fence of the miter saw. Place the top of the crown, or the part that will either touch the ceiling or stand freely, to the bed of the saw. Hold these firmly to make sure they don't move. Make a clean cut through the crown. Slide your molding so the pencil mark is lined up with the saw blade. Pull the blade down and cut completely through the wood. Repeat for each straight piece.
