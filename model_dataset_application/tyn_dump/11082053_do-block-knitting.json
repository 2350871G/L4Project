          "description":"If you're in the middle of knitting a lacy piece that's curling up a lot, you may want to block it with steam so you can see the detail better. Shaping knit fabric with steam is also useful if you'll be sewing the pieces together, like a sleeve into a sweater, for instance. Steam blocking is the fastest method since you're not saturating the fabric and the fabric will dry quickly."

          "description":"Natural fibers, such as cotton and linen, won't hold their shape very well with spray or steam blocking. Instead, you'll need to soak these in water and squeeze them before you spread them flat to dry. Then, they'll hold their shape. Since these fibers tend to shrink when they get wet, it's important to submerge them in warm, not hot, water."

To prevent this from happening, put your colorful fabric into a sink full of cold water. Pour in 1 cup (240 ml) of white vinegar and soak the fabric for 30 minutes. Then, you can block your fabric.Did You Know? This is called setting the fabric and you probably don't need to do it if you're working with acrylic or synthetic yarn."

Then, you'll be able to tell if your chosen blocking method works well with your yarn.Tip: If you're working with a yarn blend, especially one that has wool, it's a good idea to test your blocking method so you don't shrink your fabric. If you tried spray blocking and can't really tell a difference with the swatch, you might want to try steam blocking. If you still can't see a noticeable change, wet block the swatch."

Because these have a tendency to melt or disintegrate, you shouldn't block knitted fabric that has novelty yarn. Knitted fabrics that contain novelty yarn are usually loose and flowy because of this. If you're only trimming the fabric with novelty yarns, block the knit fabric piece before you sew on the novelty yarn edge."

It's fine to use lots of pins, especially if you're trying to create straight edges. If you leave big gaps between the pins, it could make the fabric appear scalloped. If you're blocking a piece that you'll be seaming, measure the size the piece should be and pin it according to those dimensions. For example, if a panel for a vest should be 6 by 12 inches (15 cm \u00d7 30 cm), stretch the material to that size and pin it in place."

Just check to see if you can use it horizontally so water doesn't leak onto the fabric. Try to heat your iron at least 5 minutes before you're ready to block.

    "Wetting the Fabric to Block It Fill a sink or bowl with warm water and wool wash. Run warm water into a clean sink or large bowl until it's half full.",
    "Then, pour in wool wash according to the manufacturer's directions.",
    "Keep in mind that you can use wool wash on any type of fabric.",
    "Read the wool wash directions carefully since some washes need to you rinse them.",
    "You can buy wool wash at craft stores, fabric supply stores, or online.",
    "If you can't find wool wash, use gentle fabric detergent that's designed for delicate fabrics.",
    "Soak the fabric in the sink for 30 minutes.",
    "Put your knitted fabric into the solution in the sink and submerge it.",
    "Squeeze the fabric a few times so the wool wash solution gets deep into the fibers.",
    "Then, leave the fabric in the sink for 30 minutes.",
    "You can soak several pieces at the same time.",
    "If you're going to block something large, such as a blanket, you could fill the bathtub or a utility sink with water and the wool wash.",
    "Drain the water and squeeze the fabric.",
    "Use both hands to lift the wet fabric out of the water and ensure that you don't let the wet fabric hang, which could stretch the fibers.",
    "Squeeze the wet fabric between both of your palms so excess water drips into the sink.",
    "You shouldn't wring or twist the fabric since this could stretch or warp the knit.",
    "Arrange the wet fabric on a towel and roll it up.",
    "Lay a clean towel on your work surface or the floor, if you're blocking a large item, and place the wet fabric on it.",
    "Roll the towel over the wet fabric so it's completely wrapped together.",
    "Consider using towels that are designated for blocking since the colors of your fabric might still bleed a little.",
    "Press or squeeze the towel with the rolled up fabric.",
    "Use your hands to squeeze all over the towel so it absorbs the water from the knitted fabric.",
    "If you placed the towel on the floor, you can step on it so it absorbs the water.",
    "Remember to take your socks off and work on a hard floor if you're stepping on the towel.",
    "Spread the wet fabric on a blocking board.",
    "You can spread blankets, scarfs, hats, or swatches so they lay flat on the board.",
    "If you're blocking a garment, you might want to measure the fabric pieces so they fit according to your pattern.",
    "There's no need to pin the fabric in place unless it starts curling up.Did You Know?",
    "You should never pin a gauge swatch since you're blocking it in order to see if the fabric shrinks or expands.",
    "If you're blocking something small like a hat, there's no need to pin it in place.",
    "Dry the fabric for at least 24 hours before you take out the pins.",
    "Although your fabric might feel dry sooner, it's a good idea to leave it for 1 full day so the fibers hold their shape better.",
    "Once the fabric is totally dry, pull out each of the blocking pins.",
    "Consider running a ceiling or room fan to get the air circulating.",
    "To encourage drying, you can flip the fabric over halfway through the drying time."
