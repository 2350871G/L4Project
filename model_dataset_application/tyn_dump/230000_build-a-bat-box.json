They need an airtight enclosure as they will regulate the interior heat by moving up or down in the chamber. The box should be installed in the right location (somewhere where they will get 4-5 hours of morning sun, 15-20 feet above the ground). Review several plans. Some are better than others. Think about the concepts which are common to all. Gather materials and tools and clear a suitable workspace.  Think about the work plan; you will measure, cut and fit materials, and then assemble.  Example Cut a 12 feet (3.7 m) section of 1x8 rough sawn board into the following:Three pieces 22 inches (55.9 cm) long (creating the sides and back of your \"house\") One 17.25 inches (43.8 cm) long (front of the house) Two 13 inch (33.0 cm) pieces (two partitions) One 11 inch (27.9 cm) piece (the third partition) NOTE: Set the saw blade to be very shallow and cut grooves (kerf cuts) in both sides of the partitions, the inside of the front board, and the inside of the back board.
