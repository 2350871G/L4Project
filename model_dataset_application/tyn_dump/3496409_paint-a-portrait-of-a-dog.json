Look for major lines of action (red lines) such as the center line of the head or the tilt of the eyes. When sketching in other features, compare their placement and orientation to these lines. Note the angles (blue lines) that parts of the head make with each other - these angles remain the same regardless of the size of your painting. Pick out spots that are easy to keep track of, such as the points of the ears, the nostrils, and hard corners where the jaw and collar overlap with the neck.
