You should find a large glass bowl or a sealed plastic container. Either will work to store the celery. If the container doesn\u2019t have a lid, you will need plastic wrap to seal it. It\u2019s also possible but not as easy to use a plastic bag that you fill with water. You\u2019ll need a supply of fresh water. The water should be clean, and it\u2019s best to use filtered water if you have it available. Even celery that\u2019s started to wilt can be brought back to life by immersing it in water.
