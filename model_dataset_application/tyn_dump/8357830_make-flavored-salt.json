Some of the more common types of flavored salts include garlic, onion, celery and ginger, but you could also use cayenne pepper, citrus zest, radish, coriander, rose petals or even brown sugar or coffee beans. Almost any natural ingredient imaginable can be dried and infused into salt. You have the option of using fresh-picked herbs, if you prefer. Just throw them in the oven for a couple hours, then grind them to a fine consistency before mixing them into the salt. Dust fresh-baked brownies with cinnamon-espresso salt, or throw a pinch of rosemary-mint onto a rack of lamb."

Use about 1 teaspoon of your chosen flavor per \u00bc cup of salt. Mix the ingredients until the particles of the dry flavorings are evenly distributed throughout the salt. To ensure proper distribution, your salt and other dry ingredients should be approximately the same size. Crush or grind larger herbs and spices if necessary to help them blend better.

A shaker of garlic, chili powder and red pepper salt makes a great all-purpose seasoning to keep on the table 24/7.
