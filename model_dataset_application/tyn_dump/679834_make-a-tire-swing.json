          "description":"The tree branch itself should be thick and sturdy, around 10 inches (25cm) diameter minimum. Be sure the tree is large and healthy, with no signs of weaknesses that might indicate the tree is unstable. An isolated Maple or Oak tree usually works best. The branch you choose will impact the length of rope you'll need. Good dimensions for a tire swing branch are about 9 feet (2.7 meters) from the solid tree branch to the ground. The branch should stick out away from the tree far enough that when you hang your tire swing off of it, the swing will not immediately hit the trunk of the tree. While you don't want to place your tire swing out at the very end of a branch, you can't attach it within a few feet of the trunk. The higher the tree branch, the higher the tire swing will swing. So, if you are making a tire swing for a small child, you may want to chose a branch that is lower to the ground."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Purchase the rope.",
          "description":"Obtain about 50 feet (15.2 meters) of rope. It should be quality rope that won't fray or break when weight is applied to it. There are a variety of ropes you can use for your tire swing, such as heavy duty climbing ropes or utility rope, but you can also use chain if you like. On a simple tire swing galvanized chain will last longer but rope is easier to handle, will potentially do less damage to the tree branch, and is easier to hold onto for kids. As well as quality rope, fraying can be prevented by the application of tubing down the length of the rope where fraying is most likely (wherever it comes into contact with the tree, the tire, and hands)."

To avoid any accumulated water, drill three holes in the tire at what will become its base. Be careful when drilling through your tire. There may be metal strands on the inside of the tire, which you may hit with your drill bit. Just be prepared that you may hit a different layer while drilling through."

If you don't have a ladder, you will need to find another way of getting the rope over the branch. Find a roll of duct tape or something of equivalent weight and tie it too the end of the rope. Then throw the duct tape over the branch, so that the rope is now looped over the branch. Once the rope is looped over the branch, untie the duct tape or whatever you used as weight for the end of the rope."

The tire should clear any obstacles on the ground and should be high enough so that your child's legs don't drag on the ground, so it should be at least a foot off the ground. On the other hand, it shouldn't be so high that your child can't get into it on their own. Be sure that the tire is at this height when you secure the knot.

    "Remember to keep the drainage holes at the bottom, with the top of the tire opposite the side with the holes.",
    "Trim off any excess rope.",
    "Tie the tail of the rope up, so that it will not accidentally get in the way or come undone.",
    "Fix the ground beneath the swing if you like.",
    "Add mulch or dig over the ground to make it a softer surface for landing when jumping (or falling) off the tire swing.",
    "Test the swing.",
    "Check that the swing is sitting well for swinging.",
    "Before allowing others on the swing, test your handiwork with a spotter nearby in case anything goes wrong.",
    "If it works well, you, and your kids, are ready to start swinging.",
    "Creating a Horizontal Tire Swing Find a tire to use.",
    "It will need to be relatively clean and in good enough condition so that the side walls will not split under weight.",
    "You can choose whatever size tire you like but remember that huge tires can weigh a lot.",
    "You do want plenty of room for several kids to sit in the tire, a very large tire may weight too much for a standard tree branch.",
    "Clean the entire tire.",
    "Give it a good wash down with heavy duty detergent, scrubbing it inside and out.",
    "You can also use a tire cleaning product to clean your tire.",
    "Identify a suitable branch that you can hang your tire swing from.",
    "It should be thick and sturdy, about 10 inches diameter and 9 feet from the ground.",
    "Be sure the tree is large and healthy, with no signs to indicate that the tree is unstable or dead inside.",
    "Make sure that the point of attachment for your swing is far enough away from the trunk that the swing will not easily hit the trunk.",
    "This means that you need to attach your swing at least a few feet out from the trunk.",
    "The distance between the branch and the tire also dictates how high it will swing.",
    "The longer the rope, the higher your swing will go, so you may want to chose a branch that is lower to the ground if you are making a swing for a small child.",
    "Purchase your materials.",
    "You will need to purchase three \"u-bolts,\" with two matching washers and nuts for each side of the bolt.",
    "In other words, you will need to have four washers and four nuts for each u-bolt.",
    "In addition you will need to obtain about 10 feet of rope, 20 feet of good galvanized chain, and an \"s\" hook large enough to have the end of three pieces of your chain hooked into one end of it.",
    "It should be quality rope that won't fray or break when weight is applied to it.",
    "There are a variety of ropes you can use for your tire swing, such as heavy duty climbing ropes or utility rope.",
    "Instead of a s-hook you can use a carabiner, connector link, or a locking swivel hook.",
    "These alternative give you the option of easily taking the swing down but will cost you a little bit more money.",
    "The chain does not need to be a huge gauge.",
    "When you purchase it, check the weight rating for the chain you intend to get.",
    "Make sure the rating is for enough weight that it will hold up a third of the weight of a few kids.",
    "It only needs to hold a third of the weight because you will have three chains to dissipate the weight.",
    "Fraying of rope can be prevented by putting tubing around it wherever it comes into contact with the tree.",
    "Drill some drainage holes into one of the sidewalls of the tire.",
    "This side will be the bottom of the swing.",
    "The holes will make sure that any water collecting on the inside of the tire due to rain will easily drain out.",
    "Be careful when drilling the holes through your tire.",
    "There may be metal strands on the inside of the tire that you will need to drill through.",
    "Place your ladder under the branch.",
    "Be sure to place it safely, so that it is on solid ground.",
    "Have a friend hold the ladder steady if you have one helping you out.",
    "Loop the rope around the tree branch and then secure the ends together.",
    "Encircle the branch several times before tying it off with a square knot.",
    "You will need to hook the s-hook onto the rope, at the bottom of the branch.",
    "Close it around the rope, so that the rope will not be able to slip out of the hook.",
    "Make sure that the knot is solid.",
    "If you can't figure out how to make one, find someone who can.",
    "Cut the chain into three pieces, each the same length.",
    "You will need to determine the length by deciding at what height you want to tire to hang.",
    "Measure down from the s-hook to the position you would like the top of the tire.",
    "This will be the length of each of your chain pieces.",
    "The tire should be high enough so that your child's legs don't drag, so it should be at least a foot off the ground.",
    "However, it shouldn't be too high, so that kids can't get in and out of it on their own.",
    "Hook one end of each chain piece into the bottom of the s-hook.",
    "Close the s-hook, by clamping it closed with some pliers, so that none of the pieces of chain can come out.",
    "Position and drill holes for the u-bolts.",
    "Be sure you have them spaced equally around the top sidewall of the tire before drilling holes for each end of the u-bolt to go through the sidewall.",
    "You will want to position the u-bolts so that they are near the outside edge of the tire, running along the circle of the tire, not across it.",
    "The outside edge of the sidewall is the stronger part of it and will assure that the tire is not misshapen when it's hanging.",
    "Remember to keep the drainage holes at the bottom, with the top of the tire where you are attaching the u-bolts opposite the side with the holes.",
    "Put one u-bolt through the end of each piece of chain.",
    "Make sure the chain is not twisted up at the top.",
    "Attach the u-bolts to the tire.",
    "Have someone help hold it up, so that you can attach the u-bolts.",
    "Place one nut and washer on each side of the bolt before sticking them through the holes toward the inside of the tire.",
    "Then attach a washer and nut onto the threads on the inside of the tire, so that the sidewall of the tire is sandwiched between the two washers and nuts.",
    "If you don't have a helper, simply place the tire on something that raises it up high enough to get the u-bolts attached.",
    "If the tire you used is excessively heavy, this may be a good idea whether you have a helper or not.",
    "Check that the swing is sitting well for swinging.",
    "Test your handiwork with a spotter nearby in case anything goes wrong before allowing others to use it.",
    "If all goes well, let the kids start playing on it right away!"
