While the tension is off the door, inspect the other components. If you notice any worn or rusted pieces, replace them before installing the new springs. For instance, if you spot a frayed cable, replace it now to avoid taking the door apart again later. Installing the New Springs Slide the left spring onto the tube and add the cable drum. When your new springs arrive, put the new left spring (the 1 with the end facing up and to the left) on the torsion tube, making sure that the stationary cone on the end of the spring faces the center bracket. After sliding the new spring into place, replace the cable drum and insert the torsion bar into the left bearing bracket. Install the center bearing and the right spring, then secure the cones. Slide the torsion bar to the left then add the center bearing. Slide the right spring onto the bar and press the bearing into the stationary cone. Connect both of the stationary cones to the center bracket with the nuts and bolts you removed previously. Remove the locking pliers or clamp from the center bracket. Thread the cables and tighten the drums. Run the lift cable between the roller and the doorjamb. Slip the lift cable stop through the cable slot on the drum. Then, attach locking pliers to the torsion tube to secure it in place. Spin the drum to wind the cable into the grooves, then tighten the set screws. Repeat on the other side, leaving the locking pliers in place. For the door to operate properly, you need the same amount of tension on both sides, so take care to tighten each side evenly. Wind the springs. Insert 2 winding bars into the winding cone so they are perpendicular to each other. Use the bars to turn the spring \u00bc turn at a time, moving the bars to new holes in the cone as necessary. Follow the supplier\u2019s recommendation for the number of turns to complete. Repeat on the other spring. Generally, you\u2019ll need 30 quarter-turns for a 7 ft (2.1 m) tall door and 36 quarter-turns for an 8 ft (2.4 m) tall door. Winding the spring too tight could cause it to break and injure you, so be sure to follow the supplier\u2019s recommendation and don\u2019t over-wind the spring. Stretch the springs out \u20444 inch (0.64 cm). When the spring is fully wound, leave 1 winding bar in a slot of the cone that is perpendicular to the floor. Tap the winding bar with a hammer to stretch the spring \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) out from the center. Repeat on the other side. Tighten the set screws. Use your fingers to tighten each set screw until it contacts the torsion tube. Then, tighten each screw \u00bd to \u00be turn more. Tightening the screws more than this could distort or puncture the torsion tube, so be sure to make less than 1 full rotation once the screws touch the torsion tube. Lubricate the springs. Slide a grocery bag or piece of cardboard behind the spring to protect the garage door. Spray each spring with garage door lubricant. Wipe off any excess, then repeat the process on the other side. Remove the clamps or pliers. It is now safe to remove the clamps or pliers you used to hold both the torsion bar and the garage door itself in place. Test the door and reconnect the opener. Lift the door up about 3 feet (0.91 m) high and let it go. If it stays in place, you did the job correctly. If it doesn\u2019t, add a \u00bc turn to each spring. Test the door again and add another \u00bc turn if necessary. Once you\u2019re satisfied, plug the garage door opener back in.",
