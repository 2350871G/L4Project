    "If you are cooking a lot of scallops, you may need to cook them in several batches.",
    "The scallops won\u2019t cook properly if the pan is overcrowded.",
    "The first scallop should sizzle when you place it on the pan.",
    "If it doesn't, wait a few more seconds before adding the rest.",
    "Cook the scallops for 2 minutes.",
    "Don't move them around or jiggle the pan.",
    "If you do this, they won't sear or heat evenly.",
    "The scallops need to sit undisturbed in the pan long enough to develop a slightly hardened, golden-brown layer on the side facing the pan.",
    "Flip the scallops and cook them for another 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "If the scallops don't peel off the pan easily, let them cook for a few more seconds.",
    "You can use a pair of tongs or a flat spatula to flip them.",
    "Again, don't jiggle the pan or move the scallops around while they\u2019re cooking.",
    "Transfer the scallops to a plate once they are done.",
    "Both side of the scallop should be opaque and golden-brown, and they should look opaque all the way through.",
    "They should be firm, but somewhat squishy, when you press down on them.",
    "Don't overcook the scallops, of they'll end up tough and chewy.",
    "Serve up the scallops while they\u2019re still warm.",
    "Serve the scallops immediately with your favorite sauce, pasta, or vegetable.",
    "The longer they sit, the less fresh they will taste.",
    "You can serve these scallops over pasta or couscous with a little lemon or olive oil, or add them to a salad!",
    "If you don\u2019t eat all of your scallops, you can store them in the refrigerator in a well-sealed container for 3-4 days.",
    "You can also freeze them in an airtight container for 2-3 months.",
    "Cooking Gourmet Pan Seared Scallops Heat a skillet over high heat with some olive oil.",
    "Add about 1.5 tablespoons (22 mL) of olive oil to the pan and turn on the heat to high.",
    "The pan is ready when the oil begins to smoke.",
    "Add the scallops as soon as you see the oil start to smoke.",
    "If you wait too long, your scallops will end up with an unpleasant smell and taste.",
    "Add the scallops into the skillet and cook them for 30 seconds.",
    "Try to spread them around so that they lay across the pan in a single layer.",
    "Don't stir the scallops during these 30 seconds.",
    "Letting the scallops sit undisturbed will give them a chance to sear a little bit.",
    "Stir in the garlic and cook the scallops for 30 more seconds.",
    "Once the scallops have cooked undisturbed for 30 seconds, give the pan a gentle toss to move the scallops around.",
    "Then, add the minced garlic to the pan and stir it in with a spoon or spatula.",
    "Keep stirring for the next 30 seconds.",
    "After about 30 seconds of cooking, the garlic should become fragrant.",
    "If not, give it a few more seconds.",
    "Boil the scallops in wine and lemon juice for 30 seconds.",
    "Give the scallops a stir to mix in the wine and lemon juice, then let them come to a boil.",
    "Let the scallops cook like this for 30 more seconds.",
    "Tip: To convert this recipe into a creamy pasta sauce, just add 1.5 cups (350 mL) of heavy cream at the same time that you add the wine.",
    "Stir in the parsley and butter, then remove the pan from the heat.",
    "Make sure the butter is cold and hard, and cut it into cubes.",
    "Stir it in along with the chopped parsley, then take the pan off the hot burner.",
    "Don\u2019t wait for the butter to melt while the pan is still on the stove.",
    "The pan will be hot enough to melt the butter even after you take it off the heat.",
    "Add the rest of the spices after the butter melts.",
    "Once you take the pan off the heat, the butter should finish melting in a few seconds.",
    "When the butter is completely melted, add the salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.",
    "Give the scallops a stir to distribute the spices evenly.",
    "Serve the scallops hot over toast or pasta.",
    "As soon as you\u2019ve stirred in the spices, serve up the scallops immediately.",
    "You can spoon them over buttered toast or serve them over the pasta of your choice.",
    "The sooner you serve the scallops, the better they\u2019ll taste!",
    "You can save any leftover scallops in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days, or keep them in the freezer for 2-3 months.",
    "Deep-Frying Bay Scallops Heat the cooking oil in a deep pot.",
    "Pour the canola oil into a large, deep pot and cook it on the stove over medium-high heat.",
    "Use a deep-fry thermometer to test the heat of the oil.",
    "It\u2019s ready when the thermometer reads 330 \u00b0F (166 \u00b0C).",

    "She has catered events and hosted pop-up dinners in the San Francisco Bay Area for over 5 years.",
    "VT\t\t\t\t\tVanna Tran\t\t\tExperienced Cook\t\t\t\tDon't have a thermometer?",
    "Vanna Tran, experienced cook, advises frying a single scallop to test the temperature of the oil.",
    "\"The scallop should bubble gently in the oil when thrown in.",
    "If the scallop is sizzling such that it splatters significantly, your oil is probably too hot.\"",
    "You should have time to prepare the other ingredients while the oil is heating.",
    "Season the scallops with salt and pepper.",
    "Put the scallops in a baking dish and generously sprinkle them on both sides with salt and black pepper.",
    "Set the seasoned scallops aside.",
    "Whisk the eggs and place the flour and breadcrumbs in bowls.",
    "Crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk them with a fork until they\u2019re well-blended.",
    "Set the bowl aside on the counter near the stove.",
    "Pour the flour and breadcrumbs into 2 separate shallow bowls or dishes and put them next to the eggs.",
    "You can use plain breadcrumbs or \"flavored\" ones (such as garlic) for something fancier.",
    "However, if you choose flavored breadcrumbs, you may need to adjust the amount of other seasonings you use.",
    "Lightly toss the scallops in the flour.",
    "You want them to be lightly coated with the flour.",
    "Because of how many scallops you have, consider working with only a few at a time.",
    "Shake the excess flour off of the scallops after you remove them from the bowl.",
    "Dip the scallops in the eggs next.",
    "After taking the scallops out of the flour, drop them into the bowl with the whisked eggs.",
    "Use your clean hand (the one not coated with flour) to gently shake the bowl around and toss the scallops in the egg.",
    "After the scallops are coated with egg, you can either remove them with your hand that\u2019s already messy or take them out with a slotted spoon.",
    "Using a slotted spoon will help keep you from wasting any of the egg.",
    "Toss the scallops into the breadcrumbs.",
    "Once you\u2019ve taken the scallops out of the egg, drop them into the bowl with the breadcrumbs.",
    "Use your clean hand to cover the scallops with crumbs or roll them around with a spoon.",
    "Make sure that they are evenly coated with the breadcrumbs.",
    "As you coat the scallops, place them in a single layer on a large baking sheet.",
    "Continue until you\u2019ve coated all the scallops.",
    "Put about half the scallops in the oil and cook them for 30 seconds.",
    "Take the coated scallops 1 at a time and gently drop them into the oil.",
    "To prevent splashing, hold the scallops low over the oil before dropping them in.",
    "Make sure to test the temperature of the oil before you start cooking the scallops.",
    "Stir the scallops and cook them for another 2 minutes.",
    "After about 30 seconds of cooking, stir the scallops with a slotted spoon to prevent them from sticking together.",
    "Let them continue to cook for another 1 and \u00bd to 2 minutes.",
    "Test the temperature of the oil occasionally and adjust the heat as needed.",
    "The scallops should be done when the breading is golden brown.",
    "You can also test them by inserting a cake tester into the middle of the scallop and holding it below your lip\u2014it should feel warm, but not hot.",
    "Since bay scallops are small, they may cook relatively quickly.",
    "Start checking them at around 1 and \u00bd minutes of cooking time.",
    "Remove the scallops from the oil and add the next batch.",
    "Once the first batch of scallops is done cooking, place them on a plate lined with paper towels and allow them to sit while you cook the next batch.",
    "This will help soak up the excess oil.",
    "You may wish to cover the cooked scallops lightly with foil or keep them warm in an oven heated to 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C) while the other scallops are frying.",
    "Serve the fried scallops with cocktail or tartar sauce.",
    "Once the scallops are cooked, serve them up while they\u2019re still hot.",
    "They\u2019ll taste great dipped in tartar or cocktail sauce!",
    "You can also squeeze lemon juice over them for extra zest.",
    "These scallops will taste best and be at their crispiest if you eat them while they\u2019re fresh from the fryer.",
    "If you have to store them, keep them in a well-ventilated container in the fridge for no more than 1-2 days."
