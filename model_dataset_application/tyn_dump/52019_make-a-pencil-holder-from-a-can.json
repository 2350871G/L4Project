Make sure the can doesn\u2019t have any damage or rust to avoid hurting yourself when handling the can. Soda cans are made of a lightweight metal, making them easier to modify.

If you are using a soda can for your pencil holder, you will need to either open the can to clean it or fill the can with soap, water and rice, and give it a good shake. Leaving food in or on the can will hinder customization efforts that you make later!"

Safely dispose of the soda can lid. If your can opening has sharp edges, use sandpaper to dull the edges. Modeling clay or other putty substances can also be used to cover the sharp edges to prevent injury. This clay can be purchased or made at home with a few simple ingredients."

Use standard scissors, tin snips, or a box cutter to cut through the aluminum. The top edges of the can will be sharp after cutting. Use modeling clay or putty to cover these edges to avoid injury. The brim of the can may also be folded inward to cover the sharp edges. Use heavy work gloves to avoid injury when handling the sharp edges."

Place some loose change or other small heavy objects in the can to help prevent the can from tipping over. Gluing a small piece of wood or cardboard to the bottom of the can will also help stabilize the can and prevent toppling. Use a polyurethane glue for a strong hold."

If using a can with harder aluminum, you may need to drill holes large enough for the pencils, as the metal will be too hard to push the utensils through. Use a small hand drill to create cleaner holes in the can. Be careful to drill slowly, as you don't want to tear a large hole in the can. Soda cans in particular are easily damaged by excessive force."

This allows a large number of pencils to be stored without offsetting the balance of the can. Frequently inserting and removing pencils from the can may eventually wear down the can, the pencils, or both. Keep pencils or pens you are particularly attached to in a location that subjects them to less wear and tear."

Acrylic paint is a great all-purpose medium for painting on various surfaces, and dries quickly, allowing you to continue to decorate your pencil holder. Use a primer before applying paint to the can in order to ensure the paint adheres to the metal. Use acrylic spray paint to give your can a full, uniform coat for adding further designs.
