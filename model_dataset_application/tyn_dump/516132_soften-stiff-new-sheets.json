If they are queen size or larger, you may want to wash the top and bottom sheets separately to give them enough room in the machine. Add one cup of baking soda. Instead of your normal laundry detergent, add one cup of baking soda to the machine. It's important to omit the detergent, as it tends to lock chemicals into the sheets. These chemicals contribute to the stiffness of the sheets, so it's better to remove them. Wash on a regular cycle. Set the machine to a regular cycle using warm water, and turn the washer on. Add a cup of vinegar during the rinse cycle. When it's time for the rinse cycle, turn the temperature of the machine to cold and add a cup of white vinegar.
