  "text":" Set Up Your Indoor Compost Bin Choose a container for your compost. You will need an opaque container that has a lid; the capacity should be around 1 to 3 gallons (4 - 11 L). Small metal garbage cans are ideal for this, as are plastic storage bins with lids. Select a location for your indoor composting. You will want to keep your compost bin close to the kitchen, as this will prevent you from having to trek across your home with your vegetable scraps. Placing the bin under your kitchen sink is an option, but a more attractive compost container could be prominently displayed as part of your d\u00e9cor. Drill holes into your container. Use an electric drill to create small holes throughout the sides and bottom of your container. These holes will allow fresh oxygen to circulate into the container, which is essential for the aerobic bacteria that drive decomposition. Place your compost bin onto a shallow tray. Finally, you'll need to position the bin on top of a shallow pan or tray that will collect any excess water that drips out of the holes in the container's bottom. Add Organic Matter to Your Compost Bin Scoop a layer of potting soil into the bin. Begin by adding a few scoops of potting soil to your compost bin - enough to create a layer a few inches (a few cm) deep. Potting soil is helpful for composting indoors because it helps regulate the moisture level of the mixture, which can prevent insect infestation or unpleasant odors. Do not use soil collected from outdoors instead of potting soil. If you intend to use the finished compost for houseplants, the consistency and drainage ability of the soil will be compromised if you introduce outdoor soil. Add your organic scraps to the compost bin. Whenever you can, collect organic scraps for composting. This can include vegetable peels or cores, coffee grounds, dead flowers, grass clippings, and leftover cooked foods like rice. Cut these scraps into small pieces to increase the available surface area for decomposition, and then place them in the bin. Add torn newspaper to your compost bin. Each time you add kitchen scraps to the compost pail, you'll need to add a handful of shredded newspaper or cardboard as well.

You can leave the bin in any location during this process, and you should continue to turn the compost once a week. The compost should be finished in a few months, when it will appear as a uniform, rich, black mixture called humus. Add the finished compost to your houseplant pots.
