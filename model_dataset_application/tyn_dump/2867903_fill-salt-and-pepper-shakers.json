  "text":" Preventing Spillage When Refilling Tape over the base holes of shakers designed for pre-ground salt and pepper. The fine grains will easily slip through when you tip the shaker upside down to fill and the tape will prevent this from happening. Turn the shaker upside down.  Fill the shaker with ground salt or pepper. To make this easier, use a small funnel to transfer from the original container to the shaker. A funnel can be purchased from the store or one can be made simply from paper (see How to make a cone or funnel from paper). Fill the shaker just to the top. Leave enough space for movement of the grains through the holes. Pull the tape off the holes. Tip the shakers back up the right way. Done! Opening Stubborn Stoppers or Plugs Ease the side of a strong, blunt knife against one side of the stopper or plug. Gently lift the knife up and ease open the stopper. This method is best for hard plastic stoppers; the knife may mark or cut into softer stoppers. Ask a stronger person to open it. In some cases, there is nothing for it but brute force. Get someone who has a strong grip to place their fingers and thumb around the edges of the stopper and to pull really hard a few times. Eventually the stopper will begin to loosen and can be pulled out. Try softening the stopper by washing the shaker in warm water.
