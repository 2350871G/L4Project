They\u2019ll grow at their peak performance if they don\u2019t get oversaturated with rainfall, though, so opt for a well-draining soil if you have that choice. These are great crops to plant if you live in a dry, arid climate. To test how well your soil drains, dig a hole that is 1 foot (12 in) deep and 1 foot (12 in) wide.

The extra space between rows will allow you to harvest the peas more easily, too. If you have to plant the rows closer together, try to stagger the placement of each seed so that there is as much room as possible between each one.
