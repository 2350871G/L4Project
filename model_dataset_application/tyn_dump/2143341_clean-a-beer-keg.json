The lid can usually be lifted off easily by squeezing and lifting the retaining bail, and the rubber gasket underneath can be pried off with your fingers.

You will need to use a standard hex wrench to unscrew the valve assemblies. The size of the fittings can vary, so try different wrench sizes until you find one that fits. The valves will likely be connected to the body of the keg either by ball-lock or pin-lock connectors. Although the two types of connectors are slightly different, they both serve the same function and can be removed with the same type of wrench."

Mix the cleaner with hot water in a separate bucket according to the proportions specified by the manufacturer. Powdered Brewery Wash (PBW) is a popular example of a commercially available alkali-wash cleaner. Other commercial keg cleaners are available for purchase at a homebrew supply store or your local hardware or home supply shop. The abrasive alkali mixture will harm unprotected skin, so wear protective plastic gloves to keep your hands safe."
