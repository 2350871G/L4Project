The espresso grounds should be much finer than the grounds for drip coffee. Measure out 18 to 21 grams (0.63 to 0.74 oz) (3 to 4 tablespoons) for a double shot of espresso. You can also purchase already ground espresso or buy whole beans and ask the baristas to grind it for espresso."

If the espresso grounds are too loose, the espresso will run out of the machine too quickly and the flavors won't develop. Try to press down with about 30 to 40 pounds (13 to 18 kg) of pressure.
