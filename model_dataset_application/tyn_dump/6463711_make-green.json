Adding more yellow will create a warmer green, and adding more blue will produce a cooler green. When attempting to change the hue, make small changes until you find the hue you want.

Pure yellow and pure blue will create pure green, but if these starting colors have been altered prior to being mixed, the resulting color will also change. For instance, combining golden yellow with a standard blue may result in a more muted, brownish green. On the other hand, mixing standard yellow with a light blue could produce a light green. The best way learn which blues and yellows produce which greens is through experimentation. Pick a few different hues of yellow and blue. Combine equal parts of one yellow and one blue hue, working through each possible combination. Mark down your results for future reference."

Experimenting with several options at once will allow you to learn more about the process. You need at least four sample dishes, but the experiment will be more effective if you set up six to twelve dishes. Place 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) of white icing in each dish. Keep track of how much icing you use since it has an impact on the amount of food coloring you'll need. Obtain at least four food dye colors: one green, one yellow, one blue, and one black. You can also get other hues of green, yellow, or blue to experiment with. Paste, powder, and gel food dyes are designed for coloring frosting, so work with these types of dyes when possible since they should not alter the consistency of the frosting. Liquid dyes only work when you need very light tints; otherwise, the amount of liquid food coloring you'll need to create a vibrant hue will change the consistency of the frosting."

To get an accurate idea of the color you've created, you'll need to continue mixing until you can no longer see any remaining green streaks in the frosting. The type of green dye you use will affect the color of the icing. For instance, using \"moss green\" dye will create a warmer color than \"kelly green\" dye or \"leaf green\" dye. The amount of food coloring will affect the shade. Since the icing is white, using small amounts of green dye will produce very light, pastel greens. More dye will create more vibrant values."

Add a very small amount of black to this third sample. After thoroughly mixing in the black food coloring, you should see a darker shade of the original green.
