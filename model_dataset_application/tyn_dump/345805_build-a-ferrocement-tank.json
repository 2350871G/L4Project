  "text":" Wall Construction Directions Cut the chicken wire/hexagonal wire mesh using the wire cutters. The tank size will dictate the necessary sizes of the mesh. Cut the electro-welded mesh using the bolt cutters. The tank size will dictate the necessary sizes of the mesh. Lay the chicken wire and electro-welded mesh flat to create layers. The layering should be as follows:  2 layers of chicken wire, 1 layer of electro-welded mesh, 2 layers of chicken wire. Using wire ties and the pliers, fasten the flat layers of mesh together.  Know that once the mesh layers are securely fastened, roll one end of the mesh to the other and attach the two ends together using the wire ties. This will create the circular body structure of the tank walls. Stand the mesh frame upright on the tank foundation and attach, using the wire ties, the frame to rebar protruding from the tank foundation.  Tie the reinforcement wire near the top of the mesh frame and connect the wire to the ground. Be sure that the wire is in tension. This will prevent the walls from buckling during the construction and concrete curing stages. Four reinforcement wires around the perimeter of the frame are sufficient. Place scrap pipes as form placeholders for the inflow, outflow, overflow, and drainage pipe locations.  Slap the concrete mortar onto the outside of the mesh frame. The mortar should be applied so that the holes of the mesh are completely filled. Allow the mortar to cure.  Repeat step 9 with the inside of the mesh frame. Use a ladder when climbing in and out of the tank structure. Allow the mortar to cure. Keep the walls wet during the curing process. Once all the mortar has been applied, the walls will be about 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick. Roof Construction Directions Cut the wood boards so that one edge is curved outward.
