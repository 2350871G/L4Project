          "description":"Wire plate hangers come in different sizes, so you need to know the size of the plate before you can purchase the hangers. Use a ruler or tape measure to determine the vertical length of your plate. If you have a simple circular plate, you only need to know the diameter. Similarly, if you have a perfectly square plate, you only need to know the length of one side. If you have a plate with uneven sides, like an oval or a rectangle, first determine which side will be the vertical side when you hang it. Measure the length of that side and choose your hangers based on that."

Note that the spring connecting both ends should be hidden behind the plate. Due to the placement of the spring, the plate will stick out from the wall a bit. Take that into consideration when using these hangers. These hangers work best with plates that are fairly normal in shape and size.
