If your soil pH is too low or too high, you may need to amend it. If the pH is too low, you can raise it by adding some lime. If it\u2019s too high, you can add some sulfur. Amending your soil\u2019s pH can take several months, so plan ahead and test your soil well before you plant your beans. Since it's so difficult to change the pH of your soil, you might consider growing your beans in a raised bed if your soil isn't right. Alternatively, you could grown a different bean."
