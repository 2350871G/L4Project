Soil blends that are 20-50% organic matter work best for potted plants, as they stop the soil from drying out quickly. To make a soil mixture that is 20% organic matter, mix 4 containers of soil with 1 container of organic matter, like compost."

Try to keep the soil slightly moist at all times, which can mean watering deeply 1-2 times a week during periods without regular rainfall. Keeping your lettuce well-watered can often help to keep aphids at bay. Avoid soaking the lettuce and over-watering it. This can result in root rot, stunted growth, and disease. Try to water your lettuce in the early morning or late afternoon. This prevents the mid-day sun from evaporating the water before it really soaks into the soil."

    "Space the lettuce plants 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) apart.",
    "Leaving 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) between each plant gives the lettuce enough room to develop into beautiful heads.",
    "However, spacing doesn\u2019t have to be exact with lettuce, because you will be harvesting the plants fairly often.",
    "Caring for Your Lettuce Give your lettuce at least 4 hours of direct sun exposure.",
    "Avoid leaving your lettuce in the sun for longer than 7 hours.",
    "Strong, hot sun exposure \u2014 particularly in the warmer afternoons \u2014 can be damaging to lettuce, so move your lettuce to shade in the afternoon.",
    "The ability to simply move your lettuce pot to control sun exposure is one of the great benefits of container gardening.",
    "Water your lettuce so the soil stays moist.",
    "Lettuce is made up of about 95% water, so it needs a lot of water to stay crisp and firm.",
    "Try to keep the soil slightly moist at all times, which can mean watering deeply 1-2 times a week during periods without regular rainfall.",
    "Keeping your lettuce well-watered can often help to keep aphids at bay.",
    "Avoid soaking the lettuce and over-watering it.",
    "This can result in root rot, stunted growth, and disease.",
    "Try to water your lettuce in the early morning or late afternoon.",
    "This prevents the mid-day sun from evaporating the water before it really soaks into the soil.",
    "Fertilize every 2 weeks once your lettuce is 8 weeks old.",
    "If you want to give your lettuce a growth boost once it is at least 8 weeks old, apply liquid or granular balanced fertilizer to the plants.",
    "This can be helpful if you have planted a lot of lettuce very close together, because those plants are going to require a lot of nutrients.",
    "When choosing a fertilizer, look for one that is well-balanced with equal parts nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium.",
    "These are sometimes marked as 10-10-10 or 5-5-5 mixtures.",
    "Harvesting Your Lettuce Harvest your lettuce in the morning.",
    "Lettuce is at its most crisp in the early morning.",
    "This is because exposure to sunlight can wilt and damage the tender leaves.",
    "Cut away the outer leaves, leaving the plant\u2019s base to re-grow.",
    "When the lettuce leaves are 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) tall, use scissors or a knife to slice away the outermost, most mature leaves from the base of the plant, which is typically called the crown.",
    "Leave the small, immature leaves at the heart of the plant to continue growing, and return to re-harvest later in the week.",
    "This method is often called the cut-and-come-again method.",
    "You can harvest lettuce by pulling the whole head out, but using this method will shorten the life and decrease the production of your plant.",
    "Avoid damaging the crown of the plant while you harvest.",
    "This can kill the plant.",
    "For romaine lettuce, see How to Harvest Romaine Lettuce.",
    "Store lettuce in your fridge for up to a week.",
    "To maximize freshness, soak your lettuce leaves in an ice bath for 5 minutes immediately after harvesting.",
    "Then, keep your lettuce wrapped in a damp paper towel or in a plastic bag in the fridge to keep it fresh for as long as possible."
