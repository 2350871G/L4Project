A good rule of thumb for a useful, compact generator is to choose an engine in the range of 5 to 10 horsepower. Note that most engines rate their horsepower at a speed of 3,600 rotations per minute (RPM). These motors are about the size of lawn mower engines, and are typically available at lawn equipment stores, industrial supply shops or power equipment outlets."

For most applications, output levels of 2,500 to 5,000 watts is suitable. In sizing the head, use the specification of the manufacturer to determine the engine size needed to drive that head. As a rough estimate, a generator can produce about 900 (749 watts per horsepower is the actual conversion) watts per input horsepower.

This pulley size must be chosen so that when the engine is rotating at the nominal running speed given by the manufacturer, the belts will scale this up or down to the pulleys of the generator head and the alternator. Choose the scaling so that the generator head and the alternator are running at the rated speed indicated on the manufacturer data sheet. In most typical generators, this will result in an engine pulley of 5 to 10 inches (125 to 250 mm). Pulleys are available at industrial supply stores and through equipment supplier catalogs."

Run the belt over the pulleys and make sure that they are taught. Slotting the mounting holes of the engine will provide good adjustment to achieve this. A V belt is preferable to a standard belt as it will have less tendency to slip. Belts may be acquired from the outlet that supplied the pulleys."
