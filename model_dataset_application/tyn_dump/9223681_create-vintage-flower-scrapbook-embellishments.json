  "text":" Making Paper Flowers Choose you double-sided scrapbooking paper. This is the trick to creating these types of flowers. Regular scrapbooking paper is too thin, and it won't have the deign on both sides. Choose paper with a vintage-looking pattern, such as:\nCursive script\nOld book pages\nFades and streaks\nScrolls and flowers Cut the paper using a scalloped circle paper punch. You will need 7 to 8 scalloped circles per flower. You can use whatever size of punch you want, but it needs to look like a scalloped circle. You can typically find it in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store, near the paper punches. Soak the cut paper with water. You can do this with a misting or spray bottle, or you can dip them in a tray of water. Make sure that they are completely soaked through. Once they dry, they will take on a worn, crumpled look. Crumple them up, then unfold them. Crumple each scalloped circle into a tight ball, one at a time. Next, while the paper is still wet, un-crumple each ball so that you can see the scalloped circle shape again. Don't smooth those wrinkles away, however! Stack the paper together, 7 to 8 at a time, alternating sides. Double-sided scrapbooking paper has a different design on each side. Alternate which design is facing up when stacking the paper. Also, off-side the scallops with each layer. This will make the flowers appear fuller.. Insert a large, decorative, scrapbooking brad through the center of the stack. Use an awl or a thick needle to poke a small hole through the center of the stack first. Next, insert a pretty, decorative brad through the hole. Flip the flower over, then spread open the prongs on the brad so that they lay flat against the flower. You can find decorative brads in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. Decorative brads are usually larger than regular brads, even the shaped ones. Choose something that looks like a brooch, cameo, or vintage coat button. Do not use the plain, brass brads. They won't look vintage enough. Allow the flower to dry. Set the flower on a tray, then leave it some place warm (preferably in the hot sun) to dry. As the flower dries, the paper will take on that thick, worn look wet paper gets after it dries. Fluff up the petals. At this point, your flower is essentially done. If you want to, however, you can add some more embellishments to it to make it look more unique. For example:\nRun a black or brown marker over the edges of the petals to give them a burnt look. Run a gold or silver glitter glue pen over the edge of the petals for extra sparkle. Remove the brad, stitch the flower together at the center, then hot glue a brooch, cameo, or fancy button over it. Use the flower. You can close the brad at the back of the flower, punch it through a scrapbook page, then open it back up again. You can also put glue dots or foam mounting tape on the back of the flower, and stick it onto your page instead. Making Lace Flowers Choose three different widths of lace.
