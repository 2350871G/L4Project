          "headline":"Prepare a metal melting furnace.",
          "description":"Melting brass requires a great deal of preparation, and a special furnace that can heat the brass rapidly before too much of the component metals oxidize. Purchase a metal melting furnace that can reach 2,000\u00baF (1,100\u00baC), constructed from a refractory material that can withstand this heat. Most brass will melt at temperatures as low as 1,650\u00baF (900\u00baC), but a higher maximum temperature will give you a margin of error, and make the brass easier to pour. Select a furnace large enough to hold the crucible and brass you intend to melt. Consider the fuel you will be using. Waste oil is a free fuel source, but the furnace may be more expensive. Propane furnaces are cleaner, but require you to keep purchasing more fuel. Solid fuel furnaces may be cheapest to purchase, or make yourself, but require significant fuel expense and cleanup if used frequently."

For brass alloys, a graphite crucible may be the best option owing to its durability and ability to be heated quickly. Crucibles made from other materials are available, but make sure they can withstand the high temperature required. Before using a new graphite crucible, heat it to 200\u00baF (95\u00baC) for 20 minutes and let cool. This removes excess moisture that can cause spattering. Each crucible should only be used for one alloy. If you also plan to melt aluminum, iron, or other metals, they will each need their own crucible."

A steel skimming spoon is used to remove dross from the surface of the metal before pouring. Finally, a pouring shank is needed to hold the crucible in place and allow you to tilt it for pouring. If you are able to weld, you may fabricate these tools yourself from scrap.

This causes the zinc to burn, producing a white smoke that can cause temporary flu-like symptoms when inhaled. Other materials such as lead may also be present, which can cause long-term damage after repeated exposure. A respirator rated for metal fume (P100 particulates) should protect you from these dangers. Children are at higher risk of lead poisoning than adults, and should be kept well away from the furnace while it is in use."

If you do not have a pyrometer, move on to the next step once the metal is glowing orange to orange yellow, or when the color becomes almost invisible in daylight. Remember to avoid any smoke that emerges from the furnace, and to wear safety equipment while nearby.

    "Use your steel skimming spoon to remove the top layer of discolored or oxidized dross from the brass, and deposit this waste onto dry sand.",
    "This will also give you a sense of whether the brass is fully melted, but try not to stir the brass or extend the spoon deep into the metal.",
    "Stirring too much can mix air and gas into the metal, which can cause defects.",
    "Note that some other metals, such as aluminum, create gases on their own, and require stirring to release these.",
    "Pour the molten brass into molds.",
    "Lift the crucible out of the furnace with steel tongs, and deposit it into the ring of the pouring shank.",
    "Use the shank and tongs to lift the crucible and pour it carefully into the molds.",
    "Some spill is likely to occur, which is why the molds are kept over dry sand to minimize spatter.",
    "You may now fill the crucible with more brass, or turn off your furnace and wait for everything to cool down.",
    "The furnace may take many hours to cool, but the ingots should be ready to handle well before that."
