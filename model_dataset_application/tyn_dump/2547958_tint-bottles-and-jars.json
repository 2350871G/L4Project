  "text":" Preparation Choose the bottles or jars you'd like to tint. It helps to have an idea for how you\u2019d like to use the bottles or jars when choosing them. For example, are you looking to create a fancy vase or do you just want a decorative jar on display? Remove the jar or bottle label and wash it thoroughly. Soak the glass jar or bottle in warm soapy water to remove the label and then wash the bottle or jar inside and out. Rinse with clean water and dry. You may want to allow the jar/bottle to air dry especially if you are working with a narrow bottle. Don\u2019t start your project until the bottle/jar is completely dry. Choose the food coloring. You'll need several bottles of food coloring as you will need to immerse the glass in plenty of coloring in order to obtain a more vibrant tint. Check \"Things You'll Need\" below for the remaining items needed to complete this project. Set up your workspace near a sink, on a flat surface. You will need quick access to water and a place to pour out the solution. Cover the area with newspaper in order to avoid staining the work surface or countertops with food coloring. Tinting the Glass Bottles and Jars Pour 3 parts Mod Podge to 1 part water into the pourable measuring cup. The exact amount will vary depending on the size of the jar or bottle you're tinting. Add food coloring gradually until you obtain a deep color. This may require more than one bottle of food coloring. Mix Mod Podge, water and food coloring well using a spoon or a knife. Make sure the food coloring is well absorbed into the entire solution. Pour a small amount of solution into the jar or bottle and swirl around the sides of the jar or bottle. Cover the entire bottle or jar sides and base before returning the color back to the measuring cup. Cover the paper plate with aluminum foil. Stand the jar or bottle upside down on top of the plate. Wait several minutes for the bottle or jar to drain before standing it upright. Allow the jar or bottle to set for approximately one hour. You want the color to return to the bottom of the bottle or jar before you solidify the color. Place the set jar or bottle in the oven on the bottom rack at 170\u00baF/77\u00baC (or the lowest possible temperature) and bake for approximately 20 minutes or until the bottle or jar is dry and transparent.  Remove the bottle or jar from the oven. Use hot pads to remove the gummy substance that congregates along the top of the glass. Finished. Place on display. The jars are particularly striking when a candle is lit inside them (a bottle is usually a bit too narrow).",
