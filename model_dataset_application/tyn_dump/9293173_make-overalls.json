    "Make sure that the rectangle is smaller than your front bib piece, but large enough to use as a pocket.",
    "A good pocket width might be 4\u201d (10 cm) by 6\u201d (15 cm).",
    "Make sure to add 1\u201d (2.5 cm) to both sides of the rectangle for the seam allowance as well.",
    "You will only need 1 piece to create the pocket, so you only need to cut out 1 rectangle.",
    "Sewing Your Pieces Together Sew your leg pieces together.",
    "If you are using a pattern, then your pattern will most likely indicate that you need to start by sewing together your leg pieces.",
    "Follow your pattern\u2019s indications to sew the leg pieces together.",
    "If you are not using a pattern, then line up your jean cutout pieces so that the right sides of the fabric are facing each other and the edges are lined up.",
    "Then, sew along the outer edges of the legs and along the inseam.",
    "Sew about \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) from the edges of the fabric.",
    "Make sure that the right sides of the fabric are facing each other when you sew the leg pieces together.",
    "This will ensure that the seam will be hidden when you wear the overalls.",
    "Do not sew along the hip areas of the overall bottoms.",
    "You will need to add a couple of buttons here to secure your overalls.",
    "Only sew up to about 3\u201d (7.5 cm) to 4\u201d (10 cm) from the tops of the outer leg pieces.",

    "Lois Wade\t\t\twikiHow Crafts Expert\t\t\t\tMake sure you have a proper sewing machine.",
    "According to Lois Wade, crafting expert: \"A good, heavy duty, sewing machine is useful when working with denim, as the layers of fabric can get too thick to sew through if you\u2019re not careful.\"",
    "Hem the legs and waistband.",
    "After you have connected the leg pieces, you will need to hem the bottom of the legs and the waistband.",
    "Turn the overall bottoms right-side out.",
    "Then, fold over about \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) of the fabric around the legs and waistband (including the side hip panels of your overall bottoms).",
    "The wrong sides of the fabric should be facing and the raw edges of the fabric should be hidden.",
    "Pin the fabric in place and then sew along the edges to secure the hem.",
    "Remove the pins as you sew.",
    "Hem the bib pieces and straps.",
    "Hem the edges of the bib pieces and straps by folding over \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) of fabric.",
    "The wrong sides should match up and the raw edges of your bib pieces should be hidden on the back side of the piece.",
    "Pin the fabric to hold it and then sew the hem in place.",
    "Remove the pins as you sew.",
    "Attach the bib pieces to the overall bottoms.",
    "Next, you will need to attach the bib to the waistband of your overall bottoms.",
    "Place the short edge of the bib so that it is centered on the front of the overall bottoms.",
    "Line up the edges of the bib and overall bottoms waistband so that the right sides of the fabric are facing each other.",
    "Then, sew along the edges to secure them together.",
    "Repeat to attach the other bib piece on the back side of your overalls.",
    "Sew the straps onto the back piece of your overalls.",
    "To attach the straps, line up the edges of the straps with the outer edges of the top of the back bib piece.",
    "Place the straps so that about \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) of the material is under the bib material.",
    "The right sides of the straps should be aligned with the wrong sides of the bib.",
    "When the pieces are lined up, sew across each of the straps twice using a zigzag stitch.",
    "This will secure the straps to the bib.",
    "Install the hardware.",
    "To complete your overalls, you will need to install your hardware.",
    "You will attach a buckle to the free ends of your straps and top front edges of your bib, and you will need to attach 2 to three buttons on each side of your overall bottoms openings.",
    "Follow the instructions included with your hardware to attach the buttons and buckles.",
    "Hammer the button pieces together to secure them.",
    "Make sure that you line up the buttons with the button holes you have created.",
    "Slide the ends of your straps through the buckle openings and sew across the straps to secure the straps in place.",
    "Sew on any buttons you want to use.",
    "If you are using any buttons that need to be sewn into place, then use a needle and thread to sew them in place.",
    "Thread a needle with about 18\u201d (46 cm) of thread that matches your fabric and/or buttons.",
    "Then, tie a knot in the end of the thread.",
    "Sew in and out of the button holes and fabric to attach the button, pulling the thread taut each time you pull it through the button hole and fabric.",
    "After the button is secured, tie a knot in the end of the thread to secure it and cut the excess.",
    "Create the button holes.",
    "You will need to cut small slits in your fabric for the button holes.",
    "Space these out by about 1\u201d (1.3 cm) to 2\u201d (5 cm).",
    "Seal each of the button hole strips with some fabric glue to prevent them from fraying, or use the button holer attachment on your sewing machine (if you have one) to sew along the edges of the button holes.",
    "This will prevent the button holes from fraying and tearing."
