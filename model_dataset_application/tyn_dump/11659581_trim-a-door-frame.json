Extend the tape measure horizontally \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) and draw a small line with a pencil. Then extend the tape measure vertically from the corner by the same distance and make another line. Repeat the process on the right side of the door frame so you know where to place the interior edges of the trim. Making reveal lines on the door frame ensures that you can open the hinges without them getting caught or damaging the trim pieces. You do not need to mark the bottom corners of the door frame."

    "For example, if there is a slight gap at the top corner between the trim pieces, sand or trim the bottom corner to widen the angle until it\u2019s flush.",
    "Be careful not to trim too much off of the side pieces, or else you may cause the pieces to look uneven.",
    "Apply wood glue to the ends of the side pieces and position them.",
    "Apply a zig-zag pattern of wood glue onto the angled end of the side piece and spread it around with your finger.",
    "Place the side pieces against the door frame so it\u2019s flush with the edges of the header piece.",
    "Repeat the process on the other side piece.",
    "If wood glue oozes out between the pieces, wipe it off with a piece of paper towel.",
    "Nail the side pieces in with finishing nails.",
    "Drive 1 in (2.5 cm) finishing nails along the inside edge of the side pieces, starting 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the top edge.",
    "Place the nails every 1 foot (30 cm) down the length of trim until you reach the bottom.",
    "Then secure the thicker exterior side of the trim with 2 in (5.1 cm) nails in the same way.",
    "You may also drive nails through the top of the header so they go into the angled ends of the side pieces if you want them held together more securely."
