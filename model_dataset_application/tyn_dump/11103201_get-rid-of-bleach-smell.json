          "description":"If your typical hand soap isn\u2019t doing the trick, try using your dish soap instead, as it\u2019s made to get rid of a wide variety of substance and smells. Lather up your hands, including between your fingers and under your fingernails, and then rinse them off with warm water. It\u2019s best if your dish soap is scented. The scent will help mask any bleach smell that remains even after washing. You may need to wash your hands several times to get rid of the bleach smell completely."

          "description":"If you have washed your hands with soap and warm water but the smell of bleach still remains, try squeezing some lemon juice on them. You can either squeeze fresh lemon juice on both of your hands or a few squirts of bottled lemon juice from your fridge. After you have rubbed your hands together for a minute or so, rinse them with warm water. This should neutralize the smell of the bleach. If you don\u2019t have lemon juice on hand, you can use another type of citrus, such as limes or grapefruit. However, lemons work best.Tip: Lemon juice is a great general cleaner because it is high in natural acids, which eliminate odors and sterilize surfaces."

          "description":"If you still can smell the bleach after soap and lemon juice, it\u2019s time to mask it with a scent you love. Squeeze a pea-sized amount of lotion on each hand and rub them together until the lotion is distributed all over the both. Pick a strong scented lotion that will keep smelling for a while. However, you can always reapply the lotion if you start smelling the bleach once again. Using lotion will also help your hands feel softer if they have been exposed to bleach, which can dry out the skin."
