          "description":"Place a square piece of paper or Formica over the curve you want to cover. Line up the sides of the square with the sides at the end of the curve. If they are lined up correctly, the point of the square will be sticking straight out from the center of the curve. Mark where each side where the curve ends on the square. Measure between each of those points and the point of the square. This measurement is the radius of your curve. In order to bend a piece of Formica without heat, the curve needs to be a certain size or the Formica will crack. It is generally agreed upon that a curve that is less 3 inches (7.6 cm) is very likely to crack."

          "headline":"Smooth out and clean the surface of the curve.",
          "description":"Countersink any nails or screws, and fill the holes with wood putty. Allow to dry and sand the entire surface, removing any paint or varnish on it. Clean the surface thoroughly so all dust is removed. This ensures that all imperfections, dents, or high spots are gone and don't show through the Formica after installation. Removing all of the dust from the surface is important because it will help the adhesive stick to the surface better."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Cut out the piece you will bend.",
          "description":"Measure the curved area to be covered using a bendable tape measure that can conform to the curve. Then transfer the measurements to the Formica, making sure that the lines are straight. Put on eye protection and cut the piece out, allowing an extra \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) all around for trimming. For small jobs, you can cut the Formica with a utility knife and a metal straightedge. Work from the back and score the line deeply. Cut again, and then hit the shorter end of the Formica against a solid surface to break it off. For big jobs with lots of cuts, use an electric saw, again working from the back. Use a fine-toothed blade to prevent chipping."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Sand the back of the Formica to make it more flexible.",
          "description":"Grab a piece of medium grit sandpaper and run it back and forth along the back side of the Formica. The goal is to just take off enough of the backing so that the Formica will bend easier. This will be a very thin layer of material. In order to take off the right amount, check the flexibility of the Formica after every few strokes with the sandpaper. Once the Formica starts bending more easily, stop standing. Use a sandpaper that is between 60 and 100 grit to ensure that you can easily get some of the backing removed. Do your sanding outside and wear a dust mask while you do it. The dust can irritate your mouth, nose, and lungs if you inhale it.Tip: Once the Formica begins to bend a little easier, stop sanding. You don't want to take off so much material that you weaken the Formica dramatically."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Apply adhesive to the Formica and the application surface.",
          "description":"To apply Formica you will use a contact cement that is specifically labeled for use with laminate. This type of product makes a strong bond between surfaces immediately. To use it, lay the Formica out on a clean surface with the backing facing up. Brush or roll a layer of adhesive on the Formica back and on the curved surface where you will be applying it. Follow manufacturer's instructions for the proper adhesive and drying times. In some cases you will need to let the adhesive air cure for a specific amount of time before applying the Formica to the substrate."

          "description":"Begin at one end of the curve and line up the end of the Formica piece exactly where you want it to go. You will not be able to reposition the Formica once it's applied, so it's important to get it in the right position the first time."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Use a J-roller to smooth out the surface.",
          "description":"Gradually bend the Formica around the curve. Run the roller along the entire piece of Formica while applying it. It's important to get all air bubbles out from in between the Formica and the curved surface, as areas with air bubbles are more likely to crack. Continue attaching the Formica, pulling it taut, and pressing it firmly to the substrate with the roller until you have covered the entire curve."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Clamp the Formica as you go.",
          "description":"Place a clamp that will hold the Formica firmly at the beginning of the curve. You can use whatever type of clamps you have on hand, whether it be c-clamps, bar clamps, or spring clamps. Then continue to attach them all along the curve so the Formica will be tight against the surface as the glue dries. If your clamps have metal pads on them that will come into contact with the Formica, put a piece of cardboard or thin wood between the clamp pads and the Formica."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Allow the glue to dry completely before trimming off any extra material.",
          "description":"Look at the directions that came on the adhesive for drying times. If you have a small amount of excess Formica on any side of the curve, leave it in place and don't cut it off yet. Wait for the adhesive to dry thoroughly before using a utility knife, saw, or router to remove it later. With most adhesives you will want to let the Formica sit for at least 24 hours before trimming it. This will ensure that the glue is at maximum strength."

This is the temperature window when the Formica will become pliable. If you use an iron, use one that you don't need to use on clothes in the future.

Once you can feel that the area is flexible, push it firmly onto the curved surface. Keep working down the curve this way, heating small sections and then attaching them. Use your gloved hand or a J-roller to press the Formica firmly onto the curved surface. Run your hand over the surface to ensure that there are no air bubbles underneath, that it is in the right position, and that the piece is securely attached. Attach clamps as you go to ensure that the Formica stays securely attached while the adhesive cures.Tip: Try cutting a scrap piece of Formica and practice using the heat gun or iron on it to see how long it takes to become pliable before starting on the big project."
