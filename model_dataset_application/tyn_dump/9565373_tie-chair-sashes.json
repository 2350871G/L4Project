Wrap the tails 1 to 2 more times around the knot if you want to make them shorter."

Twist the tails together clockwise to form a loose rope, then coil the rope clockwise into a bun. Tuck the ends behind the sash to secure the bun. You may have to re-twist the rope as you coil it. Keep the twist and coil tight so that it stays together. Secure the rosette from the back with a hatpin or a safety pin if you are worried about it coming apart."

Find the corners that are in the front of the backrest, then wrap them towards the back. Cross them in front of the rest of the fabric, and tie them into a simple single or double knot. How far you drape the sash over the chair depends on how much of the backrest you want to cover. The closer you drape it to the seat, the more you will cover."

Playing with the Position Move the knot or bow off to the side for a different look. Create your desired knot or bow first, and make sure that it is secure. Slide the sash around the backrest of the chair until the knot or bow is positioned on the side edge. You can position the knot or bow on the left or right side edge of the backrest. Adjust the height of the sash. Instead of positioning the sash in the middle of the backrest, slide it all the way down to the seat. This works great with chairs that have high backrests and side bows or knots. Wrap the sash around the backrest twice to upgrade your look. Place the sash in the back of the backrest and wrap it towards the front. Cross the left and right ends to make an X, then wrap them towards the back again. Tie your desired knot or bow. Position the knot so that the second row of crossed sashes is above the first row of straight sashes. Instead of making an X, you can simply cross the tails, wrap them around to the back of the backrest, then tie them into a bow right over the straight sash. Weave the sash through a railed backrest to keep it from sliding down. Make sure that you weave the sash through the rails in such as way so that you can still wrap it around the side edges of the backrest. This might require skipping a rail or 2. Take advantage of chairs with horizontal bars. Many chairs with railings have a horizontal bar at the top of the backrest, and another horizontal bar at the bottom, a few inches/centimeters above the seat. Instead of wrapping the sash around the sides of the backrest, wrap it around the horizontal bars instead. Adjust your bows and knots so that they are oriented horizontally. Upgrading Your Look Choose colors that coordinate with your color scheme. Use your main color for the fabric, and your accent color for any ornaments.
