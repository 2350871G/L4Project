  "text":" Traditional Opener Hold the banana in your hand, stem pointing up. It'll be easier to snap the stem back if it's positioned this way. Snap off the stem and peel the skin downward. Once you've done that, you can continue peeling the rest of the banana downward, in one or two more strips. This is the most common way to peel a banana, so chances are that you're already familiar with it. Enjoy. Now eat your tasty banana, biting into it and peeling it back further and further until you've eaten the whole thing. Monkey Magic or Upside-Down Hold the banana with the stem pointing downwards. This method has both been known as the upside-down method and the monkey method. And if it's good enough for monkeys, it should be good enough for you! Pinch or push just at the tip to tear the skin. Make sure to do this gently. If you're not having any luck, you can use your nail. Remember that one of the reasons you're doing this is to avoid smushing the banana, which happens easily when you use the traditional method. To avoid smushing the banana at its other tip, you have to still peel it gently. Peel downwards towards the stem. Just do what you would do if you were holding the banana right side up. Except this time, you should peel the pointed top downwards, toward the step. Now you can enjoy your banana! The best part is, you now have a handle to hold onto as you enjoy your favorite fruit. Snapping the Peel Take a banana that isn't overly ripe. If it's too ripe, you may find yourself in the middle of a mushy disaster if you try to snap it. Hold either side of the banana, placing it in a smiling shape. Make sure the banana is \"smiling\" or making a \"U\" shape, instead of frowning, or making the upside-down \"U\" shape. If it's pointed in the wrong direction, it'll be hard to snap it open. Think of it this way -- if the banana is \"frowning,\" then you'll be frowning too, when you're unable to peel it. Snap it in half, downwards. Use both hands to crisply snap the banana in half, like you're breaking a Kit-Kat bar. You'll need to apply some force, but not too much here. Remember, if the banana is too ripe, the skin will be softer, making it tougher to snap. Peel each banana half and enjoy. Now, just peel the skin off each banana half and enjoy your tasty fruit. Do what you would do traditionally, by peeling the skin from the top down. The skin will most likely still be connected -- it's tough to truly snap it in half -- so peeling both halves may take some finesse. You can try to break the connecting skin first and then peel one half, eat it, and then repeat with the other half. Four Splits Find a sharp knife. The sharper the knife, the easier it'll be able to cut through the skin of the banana. You should also get a cutting board so you can cut the banana on a thick, safe surface. Cut the banana from the tip to the handle. Place the banana on the cutting board and slice it from the very tip all the way to the handle. If the handle/stem is a little tough, you can use your hands to split them apart at the end. Cut each half down the middle horizontally. Now, place the two halves on the cutting board and cut them horizontally, to create four parts that are about the same size. Peel the skin off the four pieces. Now, just hold up each piece and gently peel the skin away from the fruit. This is an ideal method if you want to treat others to the banana, or if you want to enjoy the banana more slowly, in sections. It also just looks kind of cool! You're all done. Throwing the Banana Hold the stem of the banana so that it curves toward you. Take the stem in your dominant (throwing) hand and make sure that the banana is curving toward, and not away from you. Stand over a cutting board, a table, or something else that can stop the banana from flying out too far away from you. Snap the banana forward, like you're cracking a whip.

If done successfully, you should be left holding onto the stem and a sliver of peeled banana skin. If it doesn't work the first time, then try, try again -- this method does take some practice. Peel the rest of the banana the normal way. Now that you've already peeled off a sliver of banana, you can peel the banana the traditional way, from the bottom up, before you enjoy your treat. This method definitely gets creativity and flashiness points. Indenting a Thumbnail Make a tiny cut in the surface of the top of the stem. Make the cut on the inner side of the curve of the banana (inside the \"U\" shape). This works best if you have a banana that is medium ripe, so that you don't mush the banana too much. And the sharper your nails, the better. Peel the banana stem back so the skin breaks where the cut was made and peel it down all the way. If you do this correctly, it won't mush the banana. Once you've made the cut, just use the opening to peel back the rest of the banana skin. This is a fun variation on peeling a banana the regular way. Twisting the Peel Hold the banana in both hands. Leave about 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) between your hands so you have some space when you twist the banana. Twist the banana carefully without squeezing it. You should give it a quarter to a half twist, or just enough for the skin of the banana to break. Peel the banana the rest of the way. Now that you've broken the banana open, you can peel back the sides and enjoy your banana. Slice and Peel Hold the banana horizontally in one hand. When you're holding it correctly, you should place it down on a cutting board as it is. Cut off each side of the banana. Use one quick swift cut of the knife to slice off the ends of each side of the banana. Slice the banana skin lengthwise and then peel off the entire skin. Be careful when you're doing this. Cut the banana peel gently so you don't slice through it or hurt the hand that is holding on to it. Once you cut it, just peel back the skin. Enjoy. This method works great if you're planning on slicing the banana to use it in a salad, or if you just like eating a banana without a peel.",
