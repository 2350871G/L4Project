If the color does not fade or come off onto the cotton ball, the garment is safe to hand wash. Whenever using any cleaning product, such as vinegar or alcohol, first test it out on a hidden portion of whatever item you\u2019re washing. If any discoloration occurs, bring the item to a local dry cleaner to have it professionally cleaned. For spot-treating stains, the faster you get to the stain, the better. Immediately flush the affected area with cold water, rubbing the silk against itself to work the stain out without wearing the fabric. If water doesn\u2019t work, proceed to use a natural cleaning product. Never use chlorine bleach on silk."

If there\u2019s no discoloration, dip the stained area of fabric into your solution, use a clean spray bottle to apply it, or gently pour the solution over the stain. Mild solutions made with lemon juice or vinegar are good for getting out stains from perspiration or deodorant. Never apply undiluted vinegar or any other cleaner to silk. Always make sure vinegar, lemon juice, ammonia, or alcohol are diluted with lukewarm water."

You can try increasing your ratio of vinegar to water, using equal parts of each. If a stronger vinegar solution doesn\u2019t work, mix equal parts ammonia or alcohol with lukewarm water. Diluted alcohol is great for getting out ink stains. Use ammonia to remove stains from chocolate, wine, or cosmetic products."

Turn the garment over and around to ensure it is completely rinsed and free of soap. If you haven\u2019t already spot cleaned with vinegar, consider rinsing the garment in a vinegar solution. White vinegar removes soap, restores shine and softens silk. Add 1/4 cup (50 ml) white vinegar to the basin of cold water. Gently move the garment around in the water to thoroughly rinse it. Empty the basin, then fill it one more time with cold water, and give the silk one last rinse. Alternatively, or if white vinegar is not available, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) hair conditioner into the rinse water to soften your silk garment."

Make sure any wood hangers you use won\u2019t leave any dye or stain residue on your garment. Avoid drying in direct sunlight, or you\u2019ll risk discoloration or fading.

If absolutely necessary, you can consider using an iron on its silk or lowest possible setting to remove persistent wrinkles. Before using an iron, try hanging the silk item in the bathroom while you take a hot shower to release lingering wrinkles. Close the door and keep any vents off so the shower produces as much steam as possible. If you do use an iron, don\u2019t wet a wrinkled spot, as this could cause rings or increase the risk of puckering or burning the fabric. Turn the garment inside out before you use the iron."
