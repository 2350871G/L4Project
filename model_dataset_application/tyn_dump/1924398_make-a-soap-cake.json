You'll also need to melt soap base in green for leaves; do that after you've made the flowers. Spread out the melted soap thinly across a sheet of kitchen foil. Roll the flower into a flower shape. Continue to make as many flowers in desired sizes as needed. Do the same for the melting the green soap, only when it is on the foil, cut out little leaf shapes rather than rolling. Use a butter knife to gently push in one long leaf vein and some side veins too. To attach both flowers and leaves to the soap cake, dip the base of each item in hot soap base and stick in place on the top of the cake."

When it comes to time for your guests to go home, cut the soap cake into even slices and place in little cellophane bags. Tie with a ribbon and let each guest take home a piece to use in their bath or shower."
