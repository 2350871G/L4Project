Press down gently on the egg to squeeze out the runny yolk. The yolk may cook against the sides of the warm bowl, creating a delicious fried rice effect. Some people crack a raw egg on top of the dish instead. Only do this if your bowl is hot enough to cook the egg thoroughly when you mix it up."

Use less Gochujang sauce or skip it all together if you can't tolerate a lot of heat. Other optional condiments include soy sauce, salt, or Sriracha. How to Choose Your Condiments\nIf you like spicy food, drizzle extra Gochujang sauce, Sriracha, or another type of hot sauce. Red pepper flakes also add heat. If you want some crunch, sprinkle toasted sesame seeds or sea salt or mix in kimchi cabbage. To add freshness, top your bowl with sliced green onions or even a little ginger."

It shouldn't be cold but you want it to be warm, not scalding. Speed up the cooling process by pushing all of the bibimbap to one side of the bowl. The top will cool off faster so you can start eating. By the time you get to the bottom, that will also be cool enough to enjoy. Lightly blow on a spoonful before placing it in your mouth if it's still too hot."

Chopsticks can help you pile more ingredients onto your spoon. If you don't want your rice to get crispy, use your spoon to scrape the bottom of the bowl every so often while you eat to mix it up."

Short-grain, sticky rice is ideal because it clumps together, giving you that nice crust on the bottom of your bowl. Make rice on the stove or in a rice maker. You can also use leftover rice."

Some common vegetables you might find in the dish include carrots, bean sprouts, spinach, and shiitake mushrooms. For protein, choose anything from flank steak to chicken to tofu. Sautee the veggies in a garlic or soy sauce to bring more layers of flavor to the dish. Consider including kimchi, which is fermented cabbage that's very popular in Asian cooking.

For a sunny-side up egg, you don't need to flip it at all. Just make sure the egg whites are completely set. Use sesame oil to fry your egg for a toasty flavor."
