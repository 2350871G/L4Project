      "description":"Different housing materials can withstand various water pressures. The size, or spray power, ranges from 1,200 to 3,000 pounds per square inch (psi). Softer housing materials, such as painted soft-grain wood and aluminum, require a 1,200 to 1,500 psi model to prevent pressure damage. You may need a wide spray nozzle to disperse water pressure for even more vulnerable materials, like stucco. Stronger non-painted surfaces, such as vinyl, clean better with a more powerful 2,500 to 3,000 psi model. These models work the fastest. Select a pressure washer that has a detergent dispenser if you plan to use a cleaning solution."
