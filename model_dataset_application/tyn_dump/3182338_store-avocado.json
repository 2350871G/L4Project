          "description":"You can tell if your avocado is ripe or not by touching and looking at it. Ripe avocados have a dark green skin and bumpy texture. Unripe avocados are a brighter shade of green and have a smoother skin. Inspect the look and feel of the avocado. Then, try gently squeezing it. If the fruit has a little give and isn\u2019t firm, it\u2019s ripe. Unripe avocados will be hard and difficult to squeeze.Tip: Squeezing an avocado can bruise it. If you want to minimize the impact of bruising while you\u2019re testing it, press your avocado near the stem. Once an avocado is ripe, it should be consumed within 1-2 days. A ripe avocado will feel similar to a ripe orange when you squeeze it. An unripe avocado may resemble a baseball or apple in terms of firmness."

Fold the top of the bag over itself to partially seal the bag. As the fruit ripens, a chemical called ethylene is released. The bag will trap it inside, which will encourage the fruit to ripen more quickly. The temperature of your home should be 65\u201375 \u00b0F (18\u201324 \u00b0C) if you want your avocado to ripen evenly. If you aren\u2019t in a rush and don\u2019t mind waiting for a while, you can simply leave it out on the counter. It will take 2-3 days for an avocado to ripen in a paper bag. Without the paper bag, it will take 3-5 days for the avocado to ripen. Some people claim that adding an apple or banana to the bag will speed up the ripening process. There isn\u2019t much evidence that this works, though."

Use your avocado within 1-2 days of ripening. If you want to improve the flavor of you avocado, fill the brown bag with flour before burying your avocado.

    "If you really want to ensure that your avocado remains delicious, find a way to use it before freezing becomes necessary.",
    "You can freeze a ripe avocado for 3-4 months before it starts to go bad.",
    "If it isn\u2019t ripe yet, you can store it for 5-6 months.",
    "Cut the avocado in half and remove the pit and skin.",
    "If you freeze a whole avocado, the pit and skin will alter the flavor and freshness of your avocado when you thaw it.",
    "To avoid this, cut the avocado in half with a chef\u2019s knife.",
    "Then, pry the pit out with a spoon or the tip of your knife.",
    "Pull the skin off by prying it off with your finger or a kitchen knife.Tip: The skin on a ripe avocado is usually pretty easy to remove.",
    "It should slide off without much pressure.",
    "On an unripe avocado, you may need to cut the skin out by carving under it.",
    "Brush every exposed surface of the avocado with lemon juice.",
    "Fill a small bowl with 2\u20133  tsp (9.9\u201314.8 mL) of lemon juice.",
    "Grab a pastry brush and dip it in the juice.",
    "Then, brush the exterior surfaces of your avocado halves.",
    "Cover each section liberally with lemon juice to preserve it while it freezes.",
    "Wrap the avocado tightly with plastic wrap.",
    "Pull out 2 sheets of plastic wrap, roughly 12\u201318 in (30\u201346 cm) in length.",
    "Place each half near the edge of its own sheet of plastic wrap.",
    "Fold the edges on top of the avocado halves.",
    "Then, roll each half towards the opposite ends of the sheet before folding the plastic sheets over one another until you\u2019ve sealed the avocado halves.",
    "You can use a vacuum-sealed food storage bag if you prefer.",
    "These types of bags are extremely helpful when it comes to freezing fruit.",
    "Store the avocado in the freezer for 3-6 months.",
    "Place the wrapped avocados in sealable plastic bags and push the air out before sealing them.",
    "Then, set the plastic bags in the freezer.",
    "You can store a ripe avocado for 3-4 months and an unripe avocado for 5-6 months.",
    "When you go to use your avocado, let the avocado thaw on your counter for 1-2 hours before using it."
