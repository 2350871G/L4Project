When playing outside, you don't have to play when it is completely dark. If you need to be home by a certain time or if you get scared at night, you can play at dusk or in a better lit area (such as a park).

If you are an only child, ask your parents or grandparents. If your parents hesitate to let you play outside when it's dark, ask if one of them would play or at least come with you. Your friends' parents might also feel better knowing an adult is there. Bring some extra batteries with you, in case the batteries in your flashlight quit working in the middle of the game."
