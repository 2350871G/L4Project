      "description":"Insert the knife or spade into the center of the plant, and cut down through the dirt and roots. Cut it in half so you have 2 plants. Repeat the cut again with the 2 plants if you want to continue dividing. You can make the sections as small as you want, just make sure each new plant has roots and leaves (also called shoots). Try pulling the plant apart if you do not want to use a knife. Some herbs, such as chives and lemongrass, will divide easily, without the use of any tools."

You do not want any roots to be sticking up out of the dirt. Cover the roots and bottom of the plants with soil. Use a potting mix with whatever you have in your garden. Pat it into place."

Fill it about halfway, or enough so that the roots of the herb plant will be covered. Place the herb plant inside the pot. Add soil to the pot, filling it and covering the roots. Water the potted plant and place it outdoors or inside, where it will get sunlight."
