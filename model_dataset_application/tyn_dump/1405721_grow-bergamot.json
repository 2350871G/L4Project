Seeds will need to be raised in trays before transferring to the garden space. Alternatively, the plant can be grown from root divisions taken in spring or autumn/fall, or from stem cuttings taken in the summer. Growing from seeds is slow, so you may prefer this method. Once planted, bergamot will seed readily but it should be subject to regular division, to remove the dead center. Aim for dividing every three years."
