If your stripping is worn, cracked, or loose to the point that it doesn\u2019t properly seal the gap under your door, it may be time to replace it. Pull the stripping off if it is attached with adhesive. If your stripping seems to be stuck on to the bottom of the door, or if you can\u2019t see any screws or nails holding it on, gently pull it off. If it doesn\u2019t come off easily, you may need to use a knife or flat-head screwdriver to help force it off. Remove any nails or screws with a claw hammer or drill. If your stripping is attached with nails or screws, remove them using the claw end of a hammer or a drill set to reverse. If the nails or screws are still in good shape, save them to use later. The stripping may also be attached with staples, which can be removed either with a staple remover or a flat-head screwdriver. Clean the bottom of your door thoroughly. Use soap and water and, if necessary, adhesive cleaner to thoroughly clean the bottom of your door. If it is extremely dirty or difficult to get to, you may want to  take the door off its hinges for this step. Taking Measurements for New Stripping Measure the width of every door you will install stripping on. If multiple doors need new stripping, take the measurements for all of them. You can do this by using a tape measure across the width of the bottom of the door. Write down your measurements. Remember, you are measuring the door itself, not the width of the doorway. Add up the width of all the doors you measured. Once you have measured every door you plan to buy new stripping for, add up all the measurements you took. Check your math a few times to make sure it\u2019s correct. Add another 5-10% to factor in waste. It\u2019s always better to have too much than to have to go back to the store and buy more. Multiply the total width of all your doors by 1.05 or 1.1. This is how much you will buy from the store.

Check your math a few times to make sure it\u2019s correct. Then make a note of the number you came up with, so you will remember when you get to the store. Choosing a Replacement Product Use the same type of stripping you had if it\u2019s been working well. The best way to know if the stripping you buy will fit is to use the kind you already have. You can take the old stripping to the store to match it, or write down the brand and style if you know it. If your old stripping was not effective or to your liking, however, you should try something new. Choose felt or foam stripping if the door doesn\u2019t get used frequently.

It can even be painted to blend in with your door. Installing New Stripping Measure the amount of stripping you will need twice before cutting it. Even if you already took measurements before buying the stripping, measure your door again before cutting a piece to fit it. If you bought the type of stripping that slides onto the bottom of the door, you can slide on a long piece and mark where to cut it. Cut the stripping with shears or tin snips. Foam and felt should cut easily with heavy scissors or shears. For metal or metal-reinforced stripping, you will need a metal saw or tin snips. Wood should be cut with a hand saw. Read the directions on your stripping product. The stripping you bought will most likely have instructions on the packaging that explain how it should be installed.
