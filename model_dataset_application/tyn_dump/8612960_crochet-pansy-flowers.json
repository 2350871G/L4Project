Begin to single crochet into the center of the ring and around the edges. Crochet five stitches and then pull the loose thread to bring the stitches together and close the circle. Slipstitch to connect the last stitch to the first stitch. Another option for creating a ring is to make a chain of four stitches and then connect the ends into a ring. Then, single crochet around the ring by inserting the hook in through the center of the ring. However, this method will result in a gap in the center of your pansy."

Repeat the sequence again to make the second larger petal. Creating the Smaller Petals Slipstitch to next single crochet stitch and chain two. After you complete your second of the two large petals, slipstitch over to the next single crochet stitch. Then, chain two stitches. Double crochet twice into same stitch. Next, double crochet into the first stitch twice to begin building up the petal. This one will be smaller than your first two, so you will only need to double crochet twice into the stitch. Do three double crochet stitches in next stitch. For the next stitch, double crochet three times into the same stitch. This will be the central part of the smaller peal. Double crochet twice into next stitch and then slipstitch. Finish the smaller petal with two double crochet stitches into the same stitch. Then, slipstitch to finish the petal.
