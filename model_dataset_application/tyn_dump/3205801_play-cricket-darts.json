      "description":"The winner is the first player to 'close out' all of the required numbers (15\u201320, plus the bullseye) while scoring equal or more points than their opponent. A number is considered 'closed out' once it has been hit three times during the game. If the dart lands in the outer double ring of a number, it counts as two hits; the inner triple ring counts as three. For the bullseye, the outer bullseye is worth one hit and the inner bullseye is worth two. Sadly there is no triple bullseye. If a player closes out a number before their opponent, they gain points every time they hit that same number until their opponent also closes it out. Once both players close out a number, neither can gain any more points from it. Points are equal to the value of the closed out number, including any doubling or tripling. For example, if you close out the 20 and then hit a triple 20, you get 60 points. The outer bullseye is worth 25 points, and the inner bullseye is worth 50 points."

      "description":"Each player throws three darts per turn. A common strategy is to start the game by aiming at the 20\u2014specifically the triple 20\u2014since it is worth the most points, while saving the bullseye for last since it is hardest to hit. However, there is no required sequence, especially for beginners."
