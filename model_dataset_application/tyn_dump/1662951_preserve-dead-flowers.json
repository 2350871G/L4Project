If desired, clip the stem to a shorter length if it is longer than six inches, but leave at least a half-foot of length. Place the flower(s) well away from direct sunlight once you do so that they do not lose their color. This method works well for any flower that is partially dry and not prone to wilting. It also works particularly well for bouquets."

Be careful not to bunch too many flowers into one bouquet, since this may crush some or all of them. Tie your knot at the base of the stems so the flowers aren\u2019t crowded together at the top. The bigger the flower\u2019s head, the better it is to dry them individually."

With your flowers hanging upside-down, place the hangers in a room with little or no sunlight or moisture. Make sure that their placement receives plenty of air circulation to reduce the chance of mold or mildew growing on your flowers. Individual flowers be hung or laid on top of a drying rack or window-screen. In lieu of a hanger, you can also knot the string to form a loop to hang your flowers from a door or cabinet knob."

Check the petals and the base of the stem for signs of moisture. Once they are dry, cut the string or twine from the hanger and mist them with unscented hairspray to preserve their shape."

The type of microwave and the type of flower will affect how long this will take. For each new type of flower you attempt to dry in the microwave, set aside one as a crash-test dummy to experiment with time and heat levels before nuking the rest.
