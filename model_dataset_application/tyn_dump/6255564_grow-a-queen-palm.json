  "text":" Planting a Queen Palm Purchase queen palm seeds. Keep in mind that it takes these seeds two to three months to sprout. You can bypass this process by getting a seedling or small plant from a nursery. Soak your queen palm seeds in water for one day to one week. Change the water each day. Plant the seed in a pot with holes in the bottom. Plastic containers used for starts will allow for easy transplanting later on. Fill the container with soil and place the seed approximately 3/4 of an inch (2cm) or less below the surface. Place the container in a sunny spot with 85 to 90-degree (29 to 32 Celsius) temperatures.
