Very sharp blades minimize damage to the plant's cells, which reduces the amount of energy it must expend healing the wound. Any sharp, sturdy pair of scissors will do, but the shape and strength of kitchen shears make them a great choice for this job. To minimize the risk of transferring any plant diseases, especially if you\u2019re trimming more than one plant, wipe down the scissors with rubbing alcohol both before and after using them."

          "description":"Leaves with small brown areas along their edges or tips still produce energy for the plant through photosynthesis. However, if a leaf is almost entirely brown and dry, then it\u2019s not producing energy and can be removed entirely by cutting it away. If more than half of the leaf\u2019s surface area is brown\u2014and especially if it\u2019s at least two-thirds brown\u2014then it\u2019s a good candidate for full removal. The preferred way to remove a whole leaf is to cut the base of its stem with sharp scissors. Alternatively, you can pluck it by pinching the base of the stem between the nails of your thumb and index fingers."

For instance, if you\u2019re dealing with long, straight leaves with pointed tips, make two angled cuts at the tip in order to re-create a triangular shape at the end. Shaping the cuts is only necessary for aesthetic purposes. Cutting straight across the tip of the leaf to remove the dead area isn\u2019t any more damaging to the plant. With some practice, your shaped leaves will be indistinguishable from the fully healthy ones!"

In doing this, you avoid opening a fresh wound in the healthy part of the leaf, which might stress the plant and cause further browning. If you\u2019re only trimming one or two leaves, leaving some brown behind doesn\u2019t need to be a concern. However, if you\u2019re trimming many leaves at once, you may want to limit the wounds you create in healthy leaf sections."
