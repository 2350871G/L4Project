Pesto Sauce Prepare an ice bath using a large mixing bowl or sink. Fill the bowl or sink with fresh ice and water so that it's nice and cold. The ice bath will be used for soaking the basil leaves temporarily, so make sure the bowl is big enough to contain the leaves. If you're using the kitchen sink, clean it out first with soap and water. Boil 1 qt (0.95 L) of water in a pot. Turn the stove on high so the water boils quickly, and add 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of salt.
