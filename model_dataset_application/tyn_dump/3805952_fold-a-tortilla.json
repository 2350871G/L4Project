          "description":"Before you add your fillings or work on any folds, you should heat the tortilla slightly in the oven, on the stove, or in the microwave. A warm tortilla is less likely to crack than a cold or room temperature tortilla. To warm tortillas in an oven, first preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). Wrap a stack of eight tortillas in aluminum foil and heat them in your preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes. If warming a tortilla on the stove, turn one burner on high. Grab one tortilla with a pair of tongs and hold it over the burner for a few seconds, occasionally swapping sides. Remove once it softens and starts to turn brown. To warm tortillas in the microwave, wrap a stack of eight in a clean, semi-damp paper towel or dish towel. Microwave the stack on full power for 30 to 45 seconds."

    "You may want to secure the wrapped tortilla with toothpicks if it seems too loose, however.",
    "Cornucopia Roll Spread the filling near the edge.",
    "Spoon the filling over your tortilla so that it stops just short of the edge, roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) all the way around.",
    "Note that this will work better with fairly solid fillings, like diced or sliced vegetables, spreads, sliced deli meat, fruit, or large chunks of meat or fish.",
    "Do not use this method for fillings that have watery sauces or small pieces that could slip out easily.",
    "Cut the tortilla into wedges.",
    "Divide the tortilla into four quarters.",
    "Cut it down the vertical center once and the horizontal center once.",
    "Do not fold the tortilla before doing this.",
    "Make sure that you completely cut through the fillings, as well.",
    "Each wedge should be equal in size and shape, and the fillings should all be clearly separate.",
    "Fold each wedge into a cone.",
    "Wrap the tortilla around the filling from one rounded corner to the other.",
    "The two rounded corners are the corners connected to one flat edge one on side and the rounded edge of the tortilla on the other side.",
    "Imagine a diagonal line connecting the rounded corners.",
    "Fold one corner into the tortilla, gradually rolling it toward that other corner along the imaginary diagonal line.",
    "When done, you should have a cone-shaped tortilla with one closed point and one open end.",
    "Alternatively, you could simply fold one of these rounded corners over so that it meets the other rounded corner.",
    "Press the edges together to seal them.",
    "Serve.",
    "The tortilla and its fillings should be ready to enjoy at this point, but you may wish to keep it secured with a toothpick if the tortilla shell seems loose.",
    "Half-Moon Fold Spread the filling over one side of the tortilla.",
    "Mentally divide the tortilla in half.",
    "Spread the filling over one of these halves, stopping at the imaginary center line and leaving one half untouched.",
    "Spoon the filling out over this half so that it stops short of the rounded edge by about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).",
    "If working with a square tortilla shell, divide the shell in half diagonally rather than doing so crosswise or lengthwise.",
    "Note that this is the method usually used for half-moon quesadillas.",
    "Fold the uncovered half over.",
    "Bring the untouched half of the tortilla shell up and over so that it completely covers the filling.",
    "The two edges should overlap evenly.",
    "If you press the edges together firmly, you might be able to help pinch them in place, especially if you gently moisten them with water before doing so or if you plan to bake, saut\u00e9, or fry the tortilla afterward.",
    "Serve.",
    "The filled tortilla should be ready to enjoy.",
    "For quesadillas and other similar dishes, cut the folded tortilla into four wedges, with each cut starting at the center point along the folded edge and going outward toward the open edges.",
    "The tortilla should not be bulky, but if it is, secure it with a toothpick before enjoying."
