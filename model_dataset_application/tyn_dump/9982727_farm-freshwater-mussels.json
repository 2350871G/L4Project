In order to farm freshwater mussels yourself, it will be necessary to get your hands on a fresh glochidia sample. You\u2019ll then be able to raise the larvae to fully-grown mussels in a highly controlled environment. Contact your local fish hatchery or Fish and Wildlife Services office to see if they can help you find fresh mussel glochidia. The aquatic studies department at your area university might also be able to furnish you with a sample. The farming of freshwater mussels is often closely linked to regional conservation efforts. For this reason, you may have to get special permission from your local government before you can raise mussels in captivity."

Healthy glochidia will close around the salt particles and begin absorbing them slowly. The larvae that aren\u2019t viable will close very slowly, or may not close at all. Dispose of any glochidia that don\u2019t respond when exposed to the salt. Salt is used to simulate the chloride found in the blood of host fish that share rivers and stream with freshwater mussels. Glochidia feed on this chloride until they reach maturity."

The tank itself should be big enough to house a small number of fish, which will play host to the developing glochidia. If possible, incorporate other natural features as well, such as rocks, moss, and algae. The more closely your specimen tank resembles a riverbed, the more hospitable it will be to growing mussels."

The larvae will attach themselves to the gills of the fish, where they\u2019ll live as parasites until they\u2019re large enough to survive on their own. It\u2019s not necessary to place the glochidia on the gills of the host fish yourself\u2014they\u2019ll find their way there when the fish attempt to eat the larvae and scatter them throughout the water.
