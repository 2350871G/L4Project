Keep in mind that no vineyard can promise you a due date\u2014grapes are ripe when they are ripe, which means you need to be ready to make your wine at any moment. Determine how many wine bottles you want to make before you purchase any grapes. Remember that each carboy holds 6 gallons (23 L) of must, which is the mass of pulp and juice turned into wine. This amount makes about 30 bottles of wine. Try merlot grapes if you like red wines and pinot grigio for white wines. Do not substitute grocery store or table grapes for wine grapes. Order concentrated grape juice online explicitly made for winemaking to skip this step."

    "Pour it onto the surface of your grape juice and make sure it's evenly coated.",
    "Don't mix it in\u2014the yeast will metabolize the natural sugar found in the grapes into ethanol (alcohol).",
    "The amount of yeast needed is typically 1 package per 6 gallon (23 L) carboy or 70 pounds (32 kg) of grapes.",
    "Do not attempt to substitute wine yeast with common bread yeast.",
    "Store your must in an airlocked 6 US gal (23 L) plastic fermenter for 5 to 7 days.",
    "The ambient temperature of the room should be 72 to 75 \u00b0F (22 to 24 \u00b0C).",
    "Stir the wine 1 to 2 times daily and look for bubbles or foam on the surface of the liquid, which are signs of fermentation.",
    "Keep in mind that the fermentation process releases heat, so be sure to keep the wine in a cool place.",
    "Otherwise, your yeast may prematurely die.",
    "The longer you let your wine ferment, the darker it will be and the more tannins it will have.",
    "Do not ferment for longer than a week.",
    "Siphon the juice from the fermenter into a clean 6 gallon (23 L) carboy.",
    "Place the fermentation container onto a counter and the carboy onto the floor.",
    "Place the siphon into the fermenter and the inner tube into the opening of the carboy.",
    "Raise the pressure by quickly moving the inner tube in and out of the siphon 3 to 4 times.",
    "Afterward, wait for the juice to fill the carboy.",
    "Fill the carboy to 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) from the top.",
    "Remove the inner tube from the siphon to stop the siphoning process.",
    "Leave the thickest sediment behind at the bottom of the fermentation container.",
    "Cap the carboy with a bung and airlock and wait about 10 days.",
    "After securing the carboy with a bung and airlock, the second fermentation process begins.",
    "After about 10 days, the little cap in the airlock should stop popping up and down.",
    "This is the end of the fermentation process.",
    "The airlock is filled with water to allow the wine gases to escape but prevent airborne contaminants from entering the fermenter.",
    "Red wines should be fermented at temperatures between 70 to 80 \u00b0F (21 to 27 \u00b0C), while white wines should be fermented between 45 to 60 \u00b0F (7 to 16 \u00b0C).",
    "If the cap in the airlock doesn't stop moving up and down after 10 days, wait as long as 14 days.",
    "Measure the specific gravity of a sample using your hydrometer.",
    "Pour another sample of 5.07 fluid ounces (150 mL) of juice into the measuring cup.",
    "Transfer it into a 3.30 fluid ounces (98 mL) graduated cylinder and take another specific gravity reading.",
    "If the specific gravity has reached 0.996 or lower (indicating increased alcohol levels), proceed to the next step.",
    "If your specific gravity is above 0.996, allow your wine to ferment a few more days and check again.",
    "Add a mixture of potassium metabisulphite and potassium sorbate.",
    "Dissolve 0.14 ounces (4.0 g) of potassium metabisulphite and 0.194 ounces (5.5 g) of potassium sorbate into a \u20442 cup (120 mL) of cool water.",
    "Pour the mixture into the carboy and then stir it vigorously for 2 minutes.",
    "Place a funnel into the top of the carboy if your measuring cup doesn't have a spout.",
    "Purchase a wine whip from online suppliers and attach it to a \u20448 inch (0.95 cm) drill for easier stirring.",
    "Add bentonite to the wine and wait 24 hours.",
    "Add 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of bentonite to 2 cups (470 ml) of boiling water.",
    "Afterward, add 5 to 7 tablespoons (74 to 104 ml) of this mixture to each carboy of wine.",
    "The addition of bentonite prevents further fermentation and settles dead yeast to the bottom of the carboy to reduce the amount you transfer to the secondary fermenter.",
    "Wine making kits typically have a prepackaged bentonite solution.",
    "Be sure to shake it prior to pouring it into the carboy.",
    "Top up the carboy with cool water, reattach the airlock, and let it sit for 14 days.",
    "Pour the cool water to within 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the bottom of the bung.",
    "Afterward, reattach the airlock and let it sit for another 14 days.",
    "After this time, check the wine for clarity.",
    "If it isn't completely clear, let it sit for another 7 days.",
    "Always let wine sit for 14 to 21 days prior to tasting it.",
    "At this stage, you can start drinking it if it tastes to your liking or let the wine age until you're happy with the flavor.",
    "Bottling Your Wine Create a metabisulphite solution to clean your bottles.",
    "Find a clean 1 gallon (3.8 L) bucket and fill it with water.",
    "Dissolve 13.1 ounces (370 g) of metabisulphite crystals into the bucket.",
    "Sterilize your wine bottles in the metabisulphite solution.",
    "Place all your wine bottles into the solution until they are full.",
    "Take them out and scrub the insides over a sink using a bottle brush.",
    "Afterward, fill them with warm water and dump them out.",
    "Repeat this 2 to 3 more times to rinse out the cleaning solution.",
    "Always use green bottles for red wine, as red wine is light sensitive.",
    "Use sterilized tongs or gloves to handle all equipment after sterilization.",
    "Bottle the wine using a siphon.",
    "Place the fermented wine onto a clean, flat surface.",
    "Lay the wine bottles onto the floor in front of the wine.",
    "Place the siphon into the wine and the plastic tube into the wine bottles.",
    "Move the inner tube in and out of the siphon 3 to 4 times and wait for the wine to fill the bottles.",
    "Remove the inner tube from the siphon to stop the wine flow.",
    "Insert a cork into the openings of your wine bottles to seal them.",
    "Slide the corker open by pressing the outside handles upward.",
    "Place a new cork into the slot in the middle of the tool.",
    "Bring down the handles halfway and place the head of the corker over the tip of the wine bottle so it's flush with the rim.",
    "Continue pressing the handles down slowly and the cork should fit snugly into the bottle's opening.",
    "Purchase corkers from online suppliers or rent one from a local wine shop.",
    "Store your wine within 45 to 65 \u00b0F (7 to 18 \u00b0C).",
    "Although this range is fine, the ideal temperature is 55 \u00b0F (13 \u00b0C).",
    "A cool storage is ideal.",
    "Refrigerators will do for up to 2 months, but they are not ideal long-term solutions since temperatures will likely fall below 45 \u00b0F (7 \u00b0C).",
    "Purchase a wine cooler from a local wine store or online supplier for an ideal storage.",
    "Don't keep your wine in places where it could freeze, such as in the freezer or an unheated garage during the winter.",
    "Avoid regions of extreme temperature fluctuations.",
    "Age your wine based on the type.",
    "Red wines like merlot, zinfandel, and pinot noir, age best after 3 to 5 years.",
    "White wines like riesling can also be aged for 3 to 5 years, while chardonnay is best after 2 to 3 years.",
    "Ros\u00e9's are best after 1 to 2 years.",
    "If you enjoy the taste of your wine prior to aging, don't feel obligated to wait.",
    "Aging simply makes it taste different\u2014usually from the breakdown of organic tannins\u2014which is not necessarily better.",
    "Enjoy your hard work!",
    "Sniff the wine after opening a bottle.",
    "Pour it into a glass and look at the colors on the edges.",
    "Taste it and take note of the flavors.",
    "If you added tannins, take note of the dry flavor.",
    "If you want it drier, add more stems next time.",
    "Save your unopened bottles in a cool, dry place for your next dinner party."
