          "description":"Before doing any repairs to your toilet you should turn off the water outside of the toilet. You should have a water valve directly below the toilet tank. It should be located between where the water pipe comes out of the wall and where it attaches to the bottom of the toilet tank. In most cases, you will turn the water shutoff valve clockwise to turn it off. Be sure to continue turning it until it stops moving.

James Schuelke\t\t\tProfessional Plumber\t\t\t\tIt's a good idea to turn off your main water valve, as well. Find the main water shut-off valve on the outside of your home and turn it off. Then, go around your property and turn on various fixtures to confirm that they're off, but it will also drain off residual water that's inside the system. Doing this will help you avoid water damage due to a flood."

To begin draining the tank, flush the toilet and hold the flush lever down to remove as much water as possible. Once most of the water is gone, you will need to use a turkey baster or a wet-dry vacuum to get rid of the small amount of water sitting at the bottom of the tank. If you don't have a turkey baster or wet-dry vacuum, use an old towel or sponge to soak up the remaining water and any sediment left in the tank."

The float's location can be adjusted with a clip on its side, a set screw at the top of the float shaft, or by adjusting a screw at the top of fill valve where the float attaches. Look at the directions of your new toilet fill valve for exact directions for float adjustment. When positioned correctly, the top of the float should be set at about 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the top of the overflow pipe. The goal is that the float comes up and shuts off the water before the water gets high enough to flow over the top of the overflow pipe."
