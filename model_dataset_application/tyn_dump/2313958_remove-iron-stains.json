    "For a commercial option, look for a cleaner with oxalic acid as an ingredient.",
    "Oxalic acid reacts with rust, making it easy to wash away with water.",
    "Use a microfiber cloth to rub the paste into the iron stain.",
    "Scoop up the paste with a clean cloth and apply it over the stain.",
    "Always scrub along any noticeable grain in the piece of wood or metal you are treating.",
    "Look closely at the item to see which directions the grain lines run in.",
    "The grain lines run either horizontally or vertically.",
    "Following these lines reduces the likelihood of damage to the wood or metal.",
    "Wipe away the paste with a wet paper towel.",
    "Dampen a paper towel in lukewarm water and squeeze it to prevent it from dripping.",
    "Then, move the paper towel along the surface\u2019s grain to pick up the paste.",
    "After removing all of the paste, check for any leftover rust.",
    "If the iron stain is very large, expect to need to repeat the treatment a few times.",
    "The better option is to sprinkle baking soda directly onto the stain and scrub it first.",
    "Cover the stain with baking soda for 30 minutes if it is still there.",
    "Distribute the baking soda across the iron stain.",
    "Cover it completely.",
    "The baking soda will not damage the wood or metal surface, so you can\u2019t use too much of it.",
    "For large, deep iron stains, you will need to sprinkle lots of a baking soda.",
    "Follow up the treatment with a baking soda and water paste as needed.",
    "Scrub the stain with a soft-bristled brush.",
    "Choose your brush carefully, since harsher brushes leave permanent scratches in wood and metal.",
    "A nylon kitchen brush works well, or try using an old toothbrush or a specialty brush designed for soft metals like brass.",
    "Go back and forth along the grain a few times to bring any remaining brown spots to the surface.",
    "Never use metal brushes like steel wool or wire brushes.",
    "These will leave nasty scratches on most surfaces, leaving damage far more permanent than iron stains.",
    "Wipe up the remaining rust and dry the surface with paper towels.",
    "Dampen another paper towel in lukewarm water.",
    "After wringing out the excess moisture, use it to clean off the iron you loosened with the brush.",
    "Then, go back over the surface with a clean paper towel to make your wood or metal item look as good as new.",
    "Scrubbing Concrete with a Rust Remover Wear rubber gloves and protective glasses when handling rust remover.",
    "Rust removal products are generally pretty abrasive.",
    "They have to be to get tough stains out of hard surfaces like concrete.",
    "Always cover your hands and eyes before attempting to work with a rust remover or degreaser.",
    "Also, consider wearing long-sleeved clothing when working with large amounts of chemical products to prevent them from getting on your skin.",
    "Mix trisodium phosphate or another rust removal product in water.",
    "Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on your chosen product.",
    "For trisodium phosphate, combine it in a ratio of approximately \u20442 cup (120 mL) of trisodium phosphate per 8 cups (1,900 mL) of hot water.",
    "Stir the cleaner into the water to dissolve it.",
    "Purchase rust removal or degreasing products from home improvement stores.",
    "Most of these products are effective on metal and porcelain as well as concrete.",
    "Cover the stain with the solution for 20 minutes.",
    "Pour the diluted trisodium phosphate out carefully.",
    "Make sure the stain is completely covered.",
    "If you need to adjust the liquid, use a broom to guide it back onto the stain.",
    "Rinse the broom off under clean water when you\u2019re done using it.",
    "Scrub the stain with a stiff-bristled push broom.",
    "A push broom has its handle attached at an angle, allowing you to push the trisodium phosphate forward with ease.",
    "It has to have stiff bristles in order to lift the iron particles out of the concrete.",
    "Move the brush back and forth a few times until the stain is gone.",
    "Push brooms are available at most home improvement stores.",
    "Most regular brooms are not strong enough to dig the rust out of a solid surface like concrete, so a push broom is worth the cost.",
    "As an alternative, scrub the stain with a wire brush such as a grill scraper.",
    "Rinse the cleaning solution off with water from a pressure washer.",
    "Connect the pressure washer to a garden hose and water spigot, then point and shoot.",
    "Spray water to dilute the cleaner and move it off the stained area.",
    "Keep spraying until the area is clean and cleaner-free.",
    "Some home improvement stores rent out power washers.",
    "Check with them if you don\u2019t own one."
