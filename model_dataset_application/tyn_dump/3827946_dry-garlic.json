          "description":"After your garlic has grown for 5-6 months, begin inspecting the plants every week. Look to see if the leaves near the base of the plant have started to brown and wilt. Once these leaves are wilted, brush the dirt away around the garlic cloves. If the bulb is large and the cloves are fully formed, use a trowel to dig around the base of the plant. Once the soil is loose, physically pull the plant out of the ground to harvest your garlic. If the garlic won\u2019t come up easily, use your trowel to dig 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2 cm) underneath the bulb. This will tear up the root system and make the garlic easier to pull up. It\u2019s typically pretty easy to pull garlic out, though. This method applies to every variety of garlic, although some species will dry out a little faster than others. Typically, the larger the bulb, the more time it will take to dry out."

Repeat this process for every garlic bulb that you\u2019ve harvested. If you have any garlic bulbs with missing or exposed cloves, set them aside for immediate use. These cloves have likely already dried out in the ground. If they aren\u2019t already dry, they\u2019ll naturally dry out in your kitchen soon. Do not wash your garlic. You\u2019re going to peel it before using it, and you need to remove moisture, not add it."

Leave as many of the leaves on the stem as possible. Continue this process until you\u2019ve cut the roots off of every garlic bulb. Don\u2019t worry about removing every single root. So long as you remove most of them, your garlic will turn out fine. If your stems are no longer green, feel free to trim them before doing this if you\u2019d like.
