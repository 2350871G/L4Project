  "text":" Making a Basic Penguin Make the body of the penguin. Knead some black clay until it turns soft. Roll it into an oval, about twice the height of your thumbnail. Flatten one of the oval's pointy ends against your work surface until it can stand on its own. Make the head of the penguin. Roll some black clay into a small ball, about the same size as your thumbnail, or half the height of the body. Attach the head to the body. Gently press the head on top of the penguin's body. Don't worry if the head squishes a little. If you'd like, you can use a clay sculpting tool to smooth the seam between the head and the body. Roll some white clay out into a thin sheet.

Press the triangle into the middle of the white part on the body. Make sure that the pointed tip of the triangle is pointing downward. Add some eyes. Roll two small balls out of black clay. Press each ball onto the penguin to either side of the beak. They should just barely be touching the upper corners of the bead. If you don't have any black clay, you can skip this step, and paint the eyes on instead after you are done baking. Insert an eyehook into the top of the penguin. Measure the eyehook against the penguin first. If it is too long, trim it down with a pair of wire cutters. Push the eyehook down through the top of the penguin. Bake the penguin.
