To peel the asparagus, lay each spear flat and run the peeler blade down the length of the spear starting 1-1/2 inches (3.75 cm) from the top."

The salt and butter add flavor to the white asparagus spears as they cook, which is especially important since the white variety has a somewhat bland flavor on its own. The lemon juice can help prevent white asparagus from discoloring."

Spears thinner than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter may only take 8 to 12 minutes, but spears thicker than 1 inch (2.5 cm) may take up to 20 or 30 minutes.
