Remove from heat once it begins to simmer, before it reaches a full boil. White granulated sugar is fine, but if you\u2019d prefer a hint of molasses, use raw cane sugar or natural brown sugar instead. If your syrup reaches a boil, it\u2019s not the end of the world. You\u2019ll just have to wait a few extra minutes before moving on to the next step. If, however, it's boiled so long that it has begun to reduce in volume, measure how much liquid is left and add the difference."

Add a spoonful of sugar, then about a small portion of your berries. Toss them with a couple spoons or by covering the bowl with its lid and shaking it to coat the berries with sugar, which will stick to the glaze. Once they are more or less evenly coated, transfer to them to a baking sheet. Then repeat until you have coated all your berries. Working in small portions will help coat each berry more evenly. It will also prevent the sugar from clumping up due to too much moisture."

If there are any bare spots, or if you just prefer a sweeter treat, toss them again with more sugar. By now the glaze should be well on its way to dry, so it should only take another hour for the added sugar to dry to your berries."
