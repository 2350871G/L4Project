Fill a tray with a layer of pebbles.2. Add a shallow layer of water to the tray.3. Place the pot on top of the pebbles, without touching the water. Gravel1.

          "description":"Bamboo needs a soil with light to moderate density: fast-draining, but able to hold moisture. You can use a standard potting mix, or make your own from \u2153 loam, \u2153 perlite (or washed sand), and \u2153 peat moss (or well-rotted compost). Most bamboo can tolerate a wide range of well-draining soils, so the exact composition won't make or break your plants. You can use decent quality soil from your garden instead of potting soil. Avoid heavy clay soil, which drains poorly and is difficult to improve. Bamboo tends to do best in slightly acidic soil, with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5, but most species tolerate a pH up to 7.5. Most soil falls into this range."

If your bamboo came rootbound, cut it out at the edge of the pot with a clean knife. It's probably had trouble getting water, so soak the root ball (but not the stem) for 20 minutes before planting."
