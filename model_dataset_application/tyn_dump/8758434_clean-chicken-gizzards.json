Others argue that the grit within the gizzard can damage sharp knives and that only dull ones should be used. It is your choice as to what you select, but be aware that it may be more difficult to remove the thin membrane with a dull knife. If you choose to use a chopping board, make sure that it is one that is heavy and won\u2019t move while you are cutting into the gizzard. Plastic cutting boards are usually more sanitary than wood ones, but they have a tendency to be lighter and move more."

Rinse your hands under the water until they are completely clean. Dry them with a fresh towel. If you choose to wear gloves, make sure that they are well-fitting. Gloves that are too loose can make it more difficult to hold on to the gizzard."

It is also possible to thaw the gizzards by placing them in a sealed plastic bag and then submerging them in a sink filled with cold water. Drain and refill the sink with cold water every 30 minutes until the gizzards are thawed. Estimate 30-60 minutes of thawing time per pound using the cold water method. If you thaw your gizzards in the sink, make sure that the plastic bag stays sealed to prevent the spread of potentially dangerous bacteria or germs. Wipe down the sink with an antibacterial cleaner after use."

  "text":" Setting Up Your Workspace Start with a quality chicken and/or gizzards. You can either raise your own chickens for slaughter or purchase your chicken products at a grocery store or local butcher shop. They are also sometimes available at farmer\u2019s markets. It\u2019s even possible to order gizzards online via various grocery delivery programs, including some on Amazon. Prepare your workspace. Wipe down your countertop, butcher block, or cutting board with a clean, wet towel.

If you bought a chicken whole, after it is defrosted, you\u2019ll want to reach inside the cavity and remove the plastic giblet package. This package will contain the neck, kidneys, heart, and gizzards. Pull out the gizzards to use. Locate the gizzards inside the bird. If you are butchering a fresh chicken, then you will want to look for the gizzard at the end of the intestines. It will almost look like a second stomach. Reach your hand into the interior cavity and gently lift the gizzards out, taking some of the intestine with you if necessary. Just make sure to keep the intestines intact or you could risk polluting the meat and gizzard. Preparing the Gizzards Place the gizzards on the cutting board. Go slowly and be very careful as they can be a bit slippery. If the gizzards are covered in blood or debris, then rinse them with water before setting them down. Cut the gizzard in half lengthwise. Hold the gizzard down firmly, but not enough to change the overall shape. Take your knife and cut the gizzard in half, slicing all the way through until you have two separate pieces.
