  "text":" Choosing a Drainage Point Locate a large drainage system if you\u2019re pumping a lot of water. Larger areas, such as pools or deeply flooded basements, will need to be pumped carefully into larger drainage systems to avoid overflow. Choose a system with a high drainage capacity, such as a local sewer. Though laws may vary from state to state, sewers are generally the best option for draining pools. Select a gutter or storm sewer for moderate amounts of water. When pumping a tub of collected water or few inches of water out of a basement, you can often use a gutter or storm sewer. As you pump, make sure to position the end of the hose away from your house or on a grade where it naturally dumps into the drainage point. Dump small amounts of water into gutters or the ground nearby. If the water has been chemically treated, such as hot tub water, then you should use the gutter option. With clean water, such as water collected on a flat rooftop, you can use either the gutter or the ground. Choose a gutter closeby or a grassy slope that will be able to easily and safely absorb the water. Confirm with your local municipality before you start pumping water. This is especially important if you\u2019re draining a large amount of water, such as a pool or hot tub. Your local government can confirm or suggest a good time and place for you to drain the water. Place the hose nozzle at the drainage site and unroll the hose. Make sure your hose is long enough to reach the drainage point, and lay it out before you begin pumping. Position the hose so it\u2019s facing directly into the drainage site. Unroll the rest of the hose back to the area that needs draining, then connect it to the submersible pump. Setting up the Pump Turn off the electricity to any areas that need to be drained. To keep the pump and systems from running dry, make sure to shut off any electricity in the area you\u2019re draining. This includes any pumps, filtration systems, lights, or electricity sources for a pool, hot tub, well, or flooded basement. Connect your hose to the pump before you start draining.
