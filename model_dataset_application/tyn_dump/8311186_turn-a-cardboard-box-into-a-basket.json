  "text":" Making a Wrapped Basket Cut the top flaps off of a cardboard box. You can do this with a pair of sharp scissors or with a box cutter. If your box is not very stable, now is the time to reinforce it with duct tape or packaging tape. Your box can be any size, but be aware that the bigger it is, the more glue and rope you will need. Draw a short line of hot glue along the bottom edge of the box. Plug in your hot glue gun, insert a hot glue stick, and let the gun heat up. Once it's hot, draw a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) line of hot glue along the bottom edge of the box, close to one of the corners. Quickly press the end of some jute cord into the glue. You can use any thickness of cord you'd like. Thinner cord would work better for smaller boxes, while thicker cord will work for larger ones. Continue gluing and wrapping the cord around the box until you reach the top of the box. Squeeze out another 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of hot glue, and press the cord against it.

Topstitch close to the raw edge, then remove the pins. Insert the lining, and secure it with more hot glue. Set the lining into the basket.

Hot glue the hem, inch by inch (2.54 centimeters) to the top edge of the box, removing the clothespins/binder clips as you do so. Making a Woven Basket Trace the base of a box onto a sheet of fabric or felt, then cut the fabric out. This will make the inner lining of your basket. For a neater finish, cut two pieces of fabric or felt. Set these aside when you are done. You can use any size of box you want.

Coat the base of the box using tacky glue and a stiff paintbrush, then place the material on top. Smooth out any wrinkles.
