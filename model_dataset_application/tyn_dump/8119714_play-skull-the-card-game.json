If a player passes, their turn is skipped until the challenge has been resolved. Once all but one player passes or a player chooses to call out the maximum number of cards, that player must resolve the challenge. If you cannot place down another card, you must issue a challenge. Example: In a game with three players, each player puts down one card at the start of the game. Player one decides to put down another card. Player two decides to do the same, as does player three. Player one decides to put down one more card, but now player two decides to issue a challenge. Player two bets he can flip over two cards without revealing a skull. Player three bets she can flip over three cards. Player one does not feel confident enough to flip over more than three cards so he skips his turn. Player two raises the bet to four cards. Player three also decides to skip her turn, so player two must now resolve the challenge. See next step to see how to resolve a challenge."
