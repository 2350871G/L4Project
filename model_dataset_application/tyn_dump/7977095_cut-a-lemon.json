With a sharp knife in your other hand, cut off the top and bottom ends (the \u201ctop\u201d and \u201ctail\u201d) of the lemon. The fruit should now be in the shape of a barrel placed on its side. You only need to remove about 0.5\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm) from both the top and tail ends. This process will end up creating 8 wedges. If you need 16 smaller wedges, cut the lemon in half while it\u2019s on its side, after you remove the \u201ctop\u201d and \u201ctail.\u201d Then proceed with each lemon half as described below, as if they are whole lemons."

Cut straight down through the lemon with your knife to cut it in half lengthwise, then rotate the lemon 90 degrees and make another downward cut to create 4 equal sections. Steady the upright lemon with your free hand while cutting it, but be sure to keep it clear of the knife."

Slice down through the pith (the stringy, more sponge-like section at the center of a whole lemon), which also contains the seeds. Discard the pith and seeds. The pith will likely be around 0.25\u20130.5 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) thick at the tip of each quarter."
