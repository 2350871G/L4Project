For example, if you are using one 0.020\u201d (0.51 mm) piece of wire, you will need a bead with a diameter of 0.04\u201d (1.02 mm).

When you are ready to attach a clasp, first thread the end of your beading wire (jewelry cable) through a crimp bead and then through the eye of the clasp.

To use these pliers, simply grasp the crimp bead with the flat section of the pliers and squeeze gently but tightly to smash the crimp bead flat onto the wire.

You need to make sure the beads and wire make the small circumference around a wrist if you are making a bracelet.
