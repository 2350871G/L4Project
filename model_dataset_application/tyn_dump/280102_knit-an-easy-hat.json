Check the yardage on the ball so you know you have enough for your finished product. If you're using a bulky weight yarn, you'll need between 125 and 200 yards (115 and 183 meters); if a worsted weight yarn, between 150 and 300 (137 and 275 meters)."

The last thing you want is a doll-sized hat or a hat for a bucket. Measure your head. If you're giving this as a gift, the average adult head is around 22 inches in circumference (56 cm). Knit a swatch. Take note of how many stitches there are per inch. Multiply the measurement of your head by the number of stitches needed per inch. (example: 21 inches x 4 stitches per inch = 84 stitches.) This is the number of stitches you will need at the base. You may want to round down to a number divisible by eight; this will make it easier to reduce later, for the top of your hat. Rounding down is safer than rounding up; yarn stretches easier than it shrinks."
