Choose a baking sheet with a lip that\u2019s at least half an inch tall (1.27 cm) to keep bacon grease from dripping off the pan. Bacon is a greasy food, so there\u2019s no need to spray the foil with cooking spray. If you like crispier bacon, place a foil-wrapped cooling rack on the baking sheet. In this case, glass and ceramic pans can also be used. You can use parchment paper instead of foil. Use a large sheet that covers the bottom and sides of the pan."
