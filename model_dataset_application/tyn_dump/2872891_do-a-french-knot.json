Then, place the fabric you're embellishing or the hoop you're embroidering on in your lap since you'll need both hands to make the French knot."

Pull the needle to extend the floss so only about 2 inches (5.1 cm) is left underneath the fabric.

Point the tip of the needle away from the center of your hoop or fabric. Use the hand that's not holding the needle to pinch the floss that's coming away from the fabric so it's taut. This will prevent the floss from getting tangled."

Go slowly so the floss doesn't slide off of it.Tip: Keep the needle from moving or twisting as you wrap the floss. This can tangle the floss or prevent your knot from forming. If you'd like a smaller knot, try wrapping the floss around the needle only 1 time. The more you wind the floss, the bigger the knot will be. To prevent the wrapped floss from sliding off, you can use your non-dominant hand to hold the working floss taut."
