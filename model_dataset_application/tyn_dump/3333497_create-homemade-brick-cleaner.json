To make larger quantities, add more cream of tartar and water and mix it into a paste. Cream of tartar, otherwise known as potassium bitartrate, is an acidic by-product of winemaking that can be used to clean and scrub metal, ceramic, stone, and other surfaces. This paste is good for scrubbing soot and fireplace buildup from brick."

Add just enough water to make the mixture creamy and spreadable. The cleaner should have the consistency of paint or pancake batter. To make larger quantities, mix equal parts soap and salt, by weight, in a larger container. Add enough water to make the mixture spreadable. In this cleaner, the salt will act as an abrasive, and the soap will wash dirt and grease from the bricks."

Add hot water in small increments, until you can stir the mixture into a loose paste. Pumice powder is a mild abrasive that can be purchased in art stores, craft shops, and beauty supply stores.

Before you can start cleaning your brick surface, it\u2019s important to remove any items that might be in the way. For brick walls, remove pictures and nearby furniture. For mantles and fireplaces, clear away decorations and fire tools. For brick walkways, remove carpets, planters, or anything on the ground. Protect the surrounding areas.

Place the brush directly on the brick and vacuum the entire surface you brushed. This will suck up dirt, dust, and other particles that came loose when you scrubbed. Scrubbing the Bricks with Cleaner Start at the top and work in small sections. For walls, start at the top left corner and work in small sections that are about 2 by 2 feet (61 by 61 cm). Once you\u2019ve scrubbed and rinsed that section, move to the right and clean the next section over. When you reach the right corner, move down and work your way back to the left.
