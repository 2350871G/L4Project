For these reasons, wear work clothes that you won\u2019t mind getting stained and durable rubber gloves. Even in hot weather, wear a long sleeve shirt while cleaning.

          "description":"Position the ladder where you plan to begin cleaning. Lean the ladder against the wall of your house, if possible. Otherwise, lean the ladder on the gutter where it is attached to the house with a fastener, like a nail. Be sure the ladder is at the correct angle, especially if you\u2019re using an extension ladder. Put your toes against the feet of the ladder and extend your arms out straight. The ladder is in the proper position when your palms can comfortably reach the rungs. Before climbing your ladder, test it for stability by carefully climbing a step or two. If the ladder leans or wobbles, reposition it until it is sturdy. If the ground is soft, the ladder may dangerously sink. Place same-sized pieces of scrap wood under the feet of your ladder to prevent sinking, then test the ladder again for stability. Reposition the ladder as needed. Uneven or sloping ground may cause your ladder to lean. Level out the ladder by putting pieces of scrap wood underneath the leg on the leaning side of the ladder. Test the ladder for stability and make any necessary adjustments."

Bend the hook-opposite end around the handle of your bucket. Hang the bucket from the second rung from the top. Most of the debris in your gutters will be biodegradable. Should you desire to do so, debris can be thrown on the ground and left to decompose or composted. If more convenient, place a large garbage can, tarp, or wheelbarrow beside your ladder. Throw cleared debris in/on these receptacles. A plastic bag will work in a pinch as a substitute, but these can be awkward and dangerous to manage, especially if there is wind."

Putting these pieces together will result in a long, straight, rigid extension that ends in a hook. The hook formed by the elbows should curve so it is facing roughly downwards. So the tool fits inside the gutter, use a nozzle or flatten the end piece. Be sure to tape the connections of your homemade gutter vacuum thoroughly.
