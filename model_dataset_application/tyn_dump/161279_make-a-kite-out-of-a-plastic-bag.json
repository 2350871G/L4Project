          "description":"A measuring tool will help you figure out how long your frame pieces need to be compared to what size plastic bag you have. If it's a grocery bag they tend to be around 11x6 inches. That means creating a cross or 't' frame where one stick is 11 inches long and the other is 6 inches. Lay your plastic bag out on a flat surface and cut the sides and handles so it is one sheet of plastic. Measure out your kite into the plastic by drawing a diamond shape. Do not cut out your kite yet! The diamond shape can be made by measuring a lowercase 't' or cross on your plastic and using a straight edge to connect all of the points around the cross. The size is up to your plastic bag and your own preference."

The frame is key in holding the plastic open to keep your kite in the air. Measure the length and width of your diamond to find out the sizes of the frame pieces you'll need. To make sure the cross is even: mark the shorter of the two frame pieces at its center (\u00bd of its length) and the other, longer frame piece at 1/4th of its length. Make a cross or 't' with the sticks so that the two marks are on top of each other. Don't forget to double check that your frame and plastic match up."

The kite tail is essential for stability in the air and keeps your kite from nose-diving. Some kites have two tails of the same size which are then tied at their ends to create what looks like one large loop. This can look nice and gives the kite even more stability. Try out which kite tail you like best. For additional flare you can tape or tie accordion-folded tissue paper onto the plastic tail."

Lightweight nylon cord works best and is more durable than string or fishing line. A stick from outside or even a popsicle stick will work just as well for your handle.

You can do this by making another loop with your string or by tying a secure knot with the string. And your kite is ready to fly! Fly your kite. It helps to have a friend throw the kite up in the air in addition to having a breeze. Only let out about 3-4 feet of string until your kite is up in the air.
