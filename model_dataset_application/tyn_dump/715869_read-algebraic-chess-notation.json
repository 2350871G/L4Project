Write white's move after the move number and follow it with black's move, one pair of moves per line according to the following conventions:\n\nDenoting a move to an open square: Write the capital letter which designates the piece, followed by the coordinate of the destination square. For example, a knight going to the square f3 would be denoted as Nf3; a pawn going to the square e4 would be denoted simply as e4. (Remember that pawns do not get a letter). Denoting a capture:. Each capture move is denoted by the letter of the piece, followed by a lowercase x, then the coordinate of the destination square. For example, a bishop capturing a piece at c4 would be denoted as Bxc4. Sometimes, the x will be omitted. When a pawn makes a capture, the file (column) from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial. Thus, a pawn on e4 captures a piece on d5 would be denoted as exd5, or simply ed5 as the x is sometimes omitted. En passant moves are denoted by the file (column) of departure of the capturing pawn, followed by the square to which it moves, followed, optionally, by the abbreviation \"e.p.\".

For example, if two knights on d2 and f2 can both reach e4, the move is denoted as Nde4 or Nfd4, as appropriate. If two knights on d2 and d6 can both reach e4, the move would be denoted as N2d4 or N6d4, as appropriate. If three knights on d2, d6, and f2 can all reach e4, with capture, the move would be denoted as Nd2xe4, N6xe4, or Nfxe4, as appropriate. For pawn promotion, the piece to which it is promoted is written after the destination coordinate. For example, a pawn on e7 moving to e8 and promoting to a knight would be denoted as e8N. Sometimes an equal sign (=) is used, as in e8=N, or parentheses are used, as in e8(N), or a slash (/) is used, as in e8/N. Only the first type is used in FIDE standard. For castling, O-O denotes king side castle, while O-O-O denotes queen side castle. A check is denoted by + after the move notation; double check may be denoted by ++. Checkmate is denoted by # after the move notation. Some older chess literature may denote ++ as checkmate. A 1-0 is used at the end of the game to denote a white win, 0-1 to denote a black win, and \u00bd-\u00bd (or 0.5-0.5) to denote a draw.
