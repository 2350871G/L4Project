  "text":" Choose the space you want to analyze: the entire home, a room, or a smaller space such as a desk.  Stand in the main entryway facing into the room. In the Black Hat Sect method, the main entryway of a space is always the mouth of chi. Hold the bagua with the Wisdom/Career/Helpful people sections facing you and parallel to the main entryway wall. The main entryway always falls in the wisdom, career or helpful people areas. Determine which section you are standing in. For example, if you are analyzing a room, is the entryway in which you're standing in the left, center, or right? The left corner/area is the Wisdom area, as shown on the bagua map. The middle area is the Career area. The right corner/area is the Helpful People area. Use the bagua map in the same way to determine where the other sections of the bagua map are located. Once you've identified each area of the bagua, go on to the next step. Place elements of an area's corresponding element to enhance that area's aspiration. Each area of the bagua has a corresponding color and element which are usually (but not always) listed on the bagua map. Example 1: Place a yellow clay (earth) pot in the Health area of a room to enhance your or your family's health. Example 2: Paint the far wall (in the Fame area) a shade of red to attract a more positive reputation or gain recognition.",
