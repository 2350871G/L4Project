  "text":" Measure the fabric. Cut an 8 inch wide by 44 inch long (20.32 cm by 111.76 cm) strip. Fold the fabric strip in half lengthwise. Put the right sides together so the strip measures 8 inches by 22 inches (20.32 cm by 55.88 cm). Sew the 2 long edges together. Use a 1/4-inch (.635 cm) seam. Turn the bag inside out. The right side of the fabric should be facing the outside. Fold the open edge under 1/2 inch (1.27 cm). Press together. Sew a straight line down the middle of the fabric. Begin and end 2 inches (5.08 cm) from the top and bottom of the bag. Fill both sides of the bag with clean dried corn. Fill no more than 2/3 full. Pin the top of the bag closed. Place the pins sideways. Drape the bag around your neck, elbow, knee, or anywhere else you might use it to make sure it lays properly. If not, it may be too full. Adjust the amount of dried corn as needed. Sew the opening shut about 1/4-inch (.635 cm) from the folded edge.  Sterilize the corn bag.
