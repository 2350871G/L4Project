          "description":"Notice if the stem is long or short. Then, look at how far up the stem the branches begin, as well as how the branches are arranged. Notice if the plant branches only once or if it branches multiple times. Finally, record the answers to the following questions in your notebook:\nIs the stem visible? What is the shape and color of the stem? How do the branches attach to the trunk or stem? Are the branches arranged opposite each other or alternately on the stem?"

          "description":"Look at the size and shape of the flower, as well as how many petals it has. Then, observe the color of the petals and any gradation you see. Notice if the flower has a disc in the center or not. Finally, note any special characteristics of the flower that you think will help you identify it. Answer the following questions in your notebook:\nWhat color and shape is the flower? How many petals does the flower have? Does the flower have male and female sex organs in each flower? Does the flower have sepals, which are a green leaf-like part that is visible beneath the flower?Tip: When identifying the sex parts of a flower, find the stamen (male part) by looking for a wand-like growth that holds pollen. There may be several stamens. Then, check for the pistil (female part) by looking in the center of the flower for a long tube with a bulb at the bottom."

If you can, draw or trace the shape of the leaf in your notes. Record the answers to the following questions:\nHow many leaves are on each stem? Are the leaves opposite each other, alternating, or in a circular pattern? What shape and size is the leaf? Does the leaf have hairs? What color is the leaf on the front and back? What is the shape of the leaf\u2019s edge? Is it smooth, or does it have small \u201cteeth\u201d or big jagged \u201cteeth\u201d? How do the leaves attach to the stem?Tip: If you have a magnifying glass, use it to closely view the structure of the leaves. For instance, you can look at the veins on the leaves and the color gradation. Additionally, check to see if the surface of the leaf is smooth, textured, or fuzzy."

Use a digital camera or your phone to take a series of photos. Photograph the entire plant, then take close-up photos of the flowers, leaves, and stem. Make sure the photos are well-lit and show the plant\u2019s features clearly. Blurry photos will be hard to use for identification. If you\u2019re going to show the photos to an expert, take at least 4-5 photos. This will help them differentiate between similar plants."

  "text":" Examining the Plant Look at the plant\u2019s stem and branching pattern. Notice if the stem is long or short.

Finally, record the answers to the following questions in your notebook:\nIs the stem visible? What is the shape and color of the stem? How do the branches attach to the trunk or stem? Are the branches arranged opposite each other or alternately on the stem? Check if the plant is flowering or has buds. Look at the size and shape of the flower, as well as how many petals it has.
