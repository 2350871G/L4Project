Here are the most common beads you will find in bead shop or an arts and crafts store:\nPlastic beads are the least expensive and come in many different shapes and colors. They are ideal for kids' arts and crafts. For a fun, kid-friendly bracelet, try using elastic cord in a bright color, and using plastic pony beads. You can also use alphabet beads so the kids can spell their names on the bracelet. Glass beads are beautiful, and come in many different colors. They capture the light well and had a mid-price range. Most glass beads will be translucent, and some will have designs. Semi-precious stones tend to be more expensive than glass beads. They also tend to be heavier.

Stretchy bracelets are the easiest to make, and require the fewest tools. You can make a simple, child-friendly one using elastic cord and plastic pony beads. You can also make a dainty one using clear elastic and glass beads. Here is a list of what you will need:\nBeading elastic or cord. Beads\nScissors\nTape or binder clip\nSuper glue Measure your wrist and cut the elastic a little bit longer. Take the beading elastic and wrap it one and a half times around your wrist. Cut it with a pair of sharp scissors. You are making it slightly larger so that you can knot it later. Stretch the elastic. Hold the elastic between your fingers and stretch it gently. This will prevent the elastic from stretching out later on and creating gaps. Fold some tape over one of the ends of the elastic. This will prevent the beads from sliding off while you work. If you do not have any tape, or if the tape won't stick, use a binder clip instead. Put the beads onto the elastic.

Try to put the bead with the largest hole on first. Once you finish the bracelet, you can hide the knot by sliding it under that bead. Keep adding beads until you have the length you want. Be sure to wrap the bracelet round your wrist from time to time. The first and last bead should be touching, and the bracelet should be somewhat loose. You do not want it to stretch around your wrist. If you see any gaps or cord, you will need more beads. Take the tape or clip off, and tie a square/surgeon knot. Start by folding the two ends of the elastic over and under each other, like tying a pair of shoes. Tie another knot like it but don't tighten it yet; you will have something that looks like a ring. Wrap one of the tail ends around one side of the circle. Do the same thing for the other side. Now you can tighten the knot. Try to slide the knot under one of the adjacent beads. This will determine how you finish off the bracelet. Be sure to have a bottle of super glue ready.

If you try to put the bracelet on too soon, the knot may loosen and the glue may crack. Most glues will dry in about 15 minutes, and cure after 24 hours; refer to the label for more exact drying times. Making a Clasped Bracelet Gather your supplies. Clasped bracelets are more advanced than stretchy bracelets. You will need additional tools and supplies in order to finish one. Here is a list of what you will need:\nBeading wire\nClasp and hook\n2 crimp beads\n2 seed beads\nBeads\nWire cutters\nNeedle nose pliers\nTape or binder clip Measure your wrist with a measuring tape and add 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 centimeters). You are making the bracelet longer so that you can finish it. You also want the bracelet to be somewhat loose, or it won't be very comfortable. Lastly, you are adding extra length because some beads add more bulk than others. Use wire cutters and cut some beading wire according to that length. You want to use a soft, flexible wire. Do not the stiff kind meant for wire wrapping. You can find beading wire in a bead shop or in the beading section of an arts and crafts store. It usually comes on a flat, disk-shaped spool. Wrap some tape around one of the ends of the wire. You are doing this so that you can string the beads on without losing any. If you don't have any tape, you can use a binder clip instead. Consider laying out your design on a beading tray. If you do not have a beading tray, lay your pattern down on a table, right next to the measuring tape. This will allow you to determine how many beads you will need for your design. If you are doing a simple design (such as two altering colors) or a random design, you do not need to do this. Put the beads onto the wire. Once you have decided on your pattern, start putting the beads onto the wire. You do not need a needle for this. Simply hold the wire close to the end, and start popping the beads on. Be sure to measure against your wrist from time to time; large beads will add bulk, so you may need to make the bracelet longer to make it fit. Finish off by putting on a crimp bead, a lard seed bead, and one part of the clasp. Once you have all of the beads on the wire, put on a crimp bead, then a seed bead, and finally a clasp. It does not matter which part of the clasp you put on first. You can use any type of clasp. A spring or lobster-claw clasp is the most traditional, but a magnetic one may make the bracelet easier to take on and off. Thread wire back through seed bead and crimp, making a loop. The clasp should be hanging off of the top of the loop. Gently slide the crimp and seed bead towards the clasp. You want them to be snug, but still loose enough so that the clasp can still wiggle. Leave about an inch (2.54 centimeters) long tail on the wire. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to pinch the crimp bead. Be sure to pinch the bead tightly. The crimp is your \"knot,\" so it needs to be secure. Gently tug on the wire. If it moves, pinch the crimp bead tighter. Do not trim the tail off. Turn the bracelet upside down and tuck the tail into the beads. The beads will slide down towards the crimp and clasp. Tuck the tail into those first few beads, hiding it. Take off the tape or binder clip from before. Repeat the process for the other end of the wire, but don't pinch the crimp yet. Put on a crimp bead, a seed bead, and the other part of the clasp. Thread the wire back through the seed bead and crimp. Gently tug on the tail until the beads are flush with the clasp. Try the bracelet on and make any adjustments, if necessary. If the bracelet is too big, you will need to take off a few beads. If the bracelet is too small, you will need to add some more beads. To do this, simply pull the clasp, seed bead, and crimp off, and then make the adjustments. Be sure to replace the crimp, seed bead, and clasp once everything fits. Pinch the crimp bead with a pair of needle nose pliers and tug gently to test the tension. If you see things shifting a little, simply pinch the crimp harder. Thread the tail through two to three beads and snip off any excess wire. Press the flat side of the wire cutters against the bead and carefully snip off the read of the tail. Making a Multi-Strand Bracelet Gather your supplies. Multi-strand bracelets are fun to make. You make all strands using the same type of bead, but in different colors. You can also make each strand using a different type of bead. Seed beads are great for this type of bracelet.

This will allow the bracelet to hang loosely around your wrist. This will give you the length of your finished bead strands. Cut two pieces of thread that are twice the length of your measurement. You will be folding them in half in a later step. This will make one beaded strand. Hold the two threads together, fold them in half, and tie a large knot near the top of the loop. You will want about two to four knots. Don't worry if they look messy; you will be hiding them. You should end up with a large knot and four strands of thread coming out of it. This will make the bracelet more durable. Place a drop of super glue onto the knot and fold a bead tip over it. You can use your fingertips or a pair of needle nose pliers to close the bead tip. The loop on the bead tip should be on the same side as the short, extra ends of your thread. You will trim them off later. Put all four strands of the thread through a beading needle and start stringing your beads. Keep stringing until the bracelet is a little bit shorter than you want it to be. Take the needle off the thread and tie a few knots close to the last bead. Don't tie the knot too close, however, or you will put too much pressure on the thread. Try to leave a small gap between the knot and bead. Place a drop of glue onto the knots and fold a bead tip over them. You can use your fingertips or a pair of needle nose pliers to close the bead tip. The loop of the bead tip should be facing away from the beads. Repeat this process to create as many strands as you want. When you finish all of your strands, lay them out side by side in an order that you find visually pleasing. If you'd prefer a \"tangled\" look to your finished bracelet, interweave your strands rather than keeping them separate. Open two jump rings using a pair of needle nose pliers. Hold a jump ring with your fingers and a pair of needle nose pliers. The cut part of the jump ring should be between your fingers and the pliers. Hold the ring tightly with the pliers, then move your fingers away from you. The jump ring will twist open. Repeat this step for the other jump ring. Put one part of the clasp and the beaded strands onto one jump ring. Hold the jump ring with the needle nose pliers, and slip the clasp and beaded strands onto the ring. Only one end of the beaded strands should be on the jump ring. The other ends of the strands should be hanging freely. Close the jump ring. Still holding the jump ring with the pliers, take hold of the ring with your fingers. Move your hand towards you, twisting the ring close. Repeat the process for the other clasp and the other end of the beaded strands. Slip the clasp onto the other jump ring, along with the strands. Close the jump ring.",

    "To learn how to make a stretchy beaded bracelet, click here.",
    "You can buy beading elastic in a bead shop, or in the beading section of an arts and crafts store.",
    "Clear elastic thread comes in many different thicknesses.",
    "Thicker elastic is sturdy, which makes it suitable for large beads.",
    "Thinner elastic is more delicate, and looks best paired with smaller beads.",
    "Elastic cords have a thread or fabric covering.",
    "They are thick by beading standards, and usually come in black and white.",
    "Try using wire if you are more advanced.",
    "Beading wire cannot be tied like elastic, and must be used with crimps and clasps.",
    "The crimps help hold the bracelet together.",
    "Be sure to use beading wire, which is flexible.",
    "Wire used for wire wrapping is too stiff and thick; it is not suitable for beading.",
    "To learn how to make a beaded bracelet with a clasp, click here.",
    "Consider using memory wire for a fun, spiral bracelet.",
    "Know that some beads work better with certain types of string.",
    "Smaller beads will work well on thin, delicate elastic.",
    "Large beads, however, will need something heavier, such as a thicker elastic or wire.",
    "You will also need to add extra length to your bracelet if you are using bulky beads.",
    "These beads fill up the space between the bracelet and your wrist, making the bracelet fit tighter.",
    "Choose your beads.",
    "There are many different types of beads.",
    "Each material has a specific look, and some types of beads are more suitable to certain projects than others.",
    "Here are the most common beads you will find in bead shop or an arts and crafts store:\nPlastic beads are the least expensive and come in many different shapes and colors.",
    "They are ideal for kids' arts and crafts.",
    "For a fun, kid-friendly bracelet, try using elastic cord in a bright color, and using plastic pony beads.",
    "You can also use alphabet beads so the kids can spell their names on the bracelet.",
    "Glass beads are beautiful, and come in many different colors.",
    "They capture the light well and had a mid-price range.",
    "Most glass beads will be translucent, and some will have designs.",
    "Semi-precious stones tend to be more expensive than glass beads.",
    "They also tend to be heavier.",
    "Because they are made from natural materials, no two beads are alike.",
    "You can also find beads made from natural material, such as shell, wood, ivory, and coral.",
    "These tend to be expensive and unique; no two beads are the same.",
    "Decide on a design before putting the beads on the elastic or wire.",
    "When buying beads, you may find that the beads are already strung for you.",
    "This is simply another way of packaging them, and is not suggestive of a final design.",
    "Simply snip the beads off their string and arrange them in a new pattern on your desk or bead tray.",
    "Here are some ideas for a design:\nPut the largest beads towards the center, and the smallest beads towards the clasps.",
    "Alternate large beads with smaller/spacer beads.",
    "Use a warm (red, orange, yellow) or a cool (green, blue, and purple) color scheme.",
    "Choose a bunch of beads that are all the same color, but in different sizes and shades.",
    "For example, you could use light blue, medium blue, and dark blue beads.",
    "Consider getting a bead tray.",
    "You can find them in bead shops or in the beading section of an arts and crafts store.",
    "They usually come in gray, and have a velvety texture.",
    "They have necklace-shaped groves with measurements.",
    "This allows beaders to lay out their pattern and see what their necklace or bracelet may look like before they put the beads on the string.",
    "Making a Stretchy Bracelet Gather your supplies.",
    "Stretchy bracelets are the easiest to make, and require the fewest tools.",
    "You can make a simple, child-friendly one using elastic cord and plastic pony beads.",
    "You can also make a dainty one using clear elastic and glass beads.",
    "Here is a list of what you will need:\nBeading elastic or cord.",
    "Beads\nScissors\nTape or binder clip\nSuper glue Measure your wrist and cut the elastic a little bit longer.",
    "Take the beading elastic and wrap it one and a half times around your wrist.",
    "Cut it with a pair of sharp scissors.",
    "You are making it slightly larger so that you can knot it later.",
    "Stretch the elastic.",
    "Hold the elastic between your fingers and stretch it gently.",
    "This will prevent the elastic from stretching out later on and creating gaps.",
    "Fold some tape over one of the ends of the elastic.",
    "This will prevent the beads from sliding off while you work.",
    "If you do not have any tape, or if the tape won't stick, use a binder clip instead.",
    "Put the beads onto the elastic.",
    "You do not need a needle for this; most elastic is stiff enough that you can put the bead directly onto the string.",
    "Hold the elastic close to the end, and slip the beads on.",
    "Try to put the bead with the largest hole on first.",
    "Once you finish the bracelet, you can hide the knot by sliding it under that bead.",
    "Keep adding beads until you have the length you want.",
    "Be sure to wrap the bracelet round your wrist from time to time.",
    "The first and last bead should be touching, and the bracelet should be somewhat loose.",
    "You do not want it to stretch around your wrist.",
    "If you see any gaps or cord, you will need more beads.",
    "Take the tape or clip off, and tie a square/surgeon knot.",
    "Start by folding the two ends of the elastic over and under each other, like tying a pair of shoes.",
    "Tie another knot like it but don't tighten it yet; you will have something that looks like a ring.",
    "Wrap one of the tail ends around one side of the circle.",
    "Do the same thing for the other side.",
    "Now you can tighten the knot.",
    "Try to slide the knot under one of the adjacent beads.",
    "This will determine how you finish off the bracelet.",
    "Be sure to have a bottle of super glue ready.",
    "If you can slide the knot under one of the beads, trim off the extra string and put a drop of glue over the knot.",
    "Slide the knot under the bead.",
    "If you can't fit the knot under one of the beads, tuck the tail ends inside the beads instead.",
    "Put a drop of glue on top of the knot to seal it.",
    "Wait for the glue to dry before wearing your bracelet.",
    "If you try to put the bracelet on too soon, the knot may loosen and the glue may crack.",
    "Most glues will dry in about 15 minutes, and cure after 24 hours; refer to the label for more exact drying times.",
    "Making a Clasped Bracelet Gather your supplies.",
    "Clasped bracelets are more advanced than stretchy bracelets.",
    "You will need additional tools and supplies in order to finish one.",
    "Here is a list of what you will need:\nBeading wire\nClasp and hook\n2 crimp beads\n2 seed beads\nBeads\nWire cutters\nNeedle nose pliers\nTape or binder clip Measure your wrist with a measuring tape and add 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 centimeters).",
    "You are making the bracelet longer so that you can finish it.",
    "You also want the bracelet to be somewhat loose, or it won't be very comfortable.",
    "Lastly, you are adding extra length because some beads add more bulk than others.",
    "Use wire cutters and cut some beading wire according to that length.",
    "You want to use a soft, flexible wire.",
    "Do not the stiff kind meant for wire wrapping.",
    "You can find beading wire in a bead shop or in the beading section of an arts and crafts store.",
    "It usually comes on a flat, disk-shaped spool.",
    "Wrap some tape around one of the ends of the wire.",
    "You are doing this so that you can string the beads on without losing any.",
    "If you don't have any tape, you can use a binder clip instead.",
    "Consider laying out your design on a beading tray.",
    "If you do not have a beading tray, lay your pattern down on a table, right next to the measuring tape.",
    "This will allow you to determine how many beads you will need for your design.",
    "If you are doing a simple design (such as two altering colors) or a random design, you do not need to do this.",
    "Put the beads onto the wire.",
    "Once you have decided on your pattern, start putting the beads onto the wire.",
    "You do not need a needle for this.",
    "Simply hold the wire close to the end, and start popping the beads on.",
    "Be sure to measure against your wrist from time to time; large beads will add bulk, so you may need to make the bracelet longer to make it fit.",
    "Finish off by putting on a crimp bead, a lard seed bead, and one part of the clasp.",
    "Once you have all of the beads on the wire, put on a crimp bead, then a seed bead, and finally a clasp.",
    "It does not matter which part of the clasp you put on first.",
    "You can use any type of clasp.",
    "A spring or lobster-claw clasp is the most traditional, but a magnetic one may make the bracelet easier to take on and off.",
    "Thread wire back through seed bead and crimp, making a loop.",
    "The clasp should be hanging off of the top of the loop.",
    "Gently slide the crimp and seed bead towards the clasp.",
    "You want them to be snug, but still loose enough so that the clasp can still wiggle.",
    "Leave about an inch (2.54 centimeters) long tail on the wire.",
    "Use a pair of needle nose pliers to pinch the crimp bead.",
    "Be sure to pinch the bead tightly.",
    "The crimp is your \"knot,\" so it needs to be secure.",
    "Gently tug on the wire.",
    "If it moves, pinch the crimp bead tighter.",
    "Do not trim the tail off.",
    "Turn the bracelet upside down and tuck the tail into the beads.",
    "The beads will slide down towards the crimp and clasp.",
    "Tuck the tail into those first few beads, hiding it.",
    "Take off the tape or binder clip from before.",
    "Repeat the process for the other end of the wire, but don't pinch the crimp yet.",
    "Put on a crimp bead, a seed bead, and the other part of the clasp.",
    "Thread the wire back through the seed bead and crimp.",
    "Gently tug on the tail until the beads are flush with the clasp.",
    "Try the bracelet on and make any adjustments, if necessary.",
    "If the bracelet is too big, you will need to take off a few beads.",
    "If the bracelet is too small, you will need to add some more beads.",
    "To do this, simply pull the clasp, seed bead, and crimp off, and then make the adjustments.",
    "Be sure to replace the crimp, seed bead, and clasp once everything fits.",
    "Pinch the crimp bead with a pair of needle nose pliers and tug gently to test the tension.",
    "If you see things shifting a little, simply pinch the crimp harder.",
    "Thread the tail through two to three beads and snip off any excess wire.",
    "Press the flat side of the wire cutters against the bead and carefully snip off the read of the tail.",
    "Making a Multi-Strand Bracelet Gather your supplies.",
    "Multi-strand bracelets are fun to make.",
    "You make all strands using the same type of bead, but in different colors.",
    "You can also make each strand using a different type of bead.",
    "Seed beads are great for this type of bracelet.",
    "Here is a list of what you will need:\nBeading thread\nBeading needle\nBeads\nBead tips (also called bead clamps, clam shells, bead ends, or string tips)\n2 jump rings\nClasp and hook\nNeedle nose pliers\nScissors\nSuper glue Measure your wrist and add \u00bc to 1 inch (0.64 to 2.54 centimeters).",
