Add several lemon wedges to the platter so you can squeeze them over the boats when serving. You can omit the chives if you prefer. Whipping Up Crustless Mini Quiches Preheat the oven and grease the pan. Set the oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) and allow it to preheat. Next, spray 2 nonstick mini-muffin tins that have 24 cups with nonstick cooking spray. You can grease the muffin tins with butter if you prefer. Sprinkle parsley and scallions in bottom of muffin cups. After you've greased the muffin tins, take 6 thinly sliced scallions and 2 tablespoons (5 g) of chopped fresh parsley and sprinkle them in the bottom of each muffin cup. Be sure to spread them as evenly as possible among the cups. Mix the eggs, yolks, parmesan cheese, milk, salt, and pepper. Add 6 large eggs plus 3 large egg yolks, \u00bd cup (50 g) of grated parmesan cheese, 1 \u00bd cups (365 ml) of milk, and salt and pepper to taste to a large bowl. Use a whisk to blend the ingredients together until the mixture is smooth. For the best results, use whole milk in the mini quiches. Fill each muffin cup with the egg mixture. Once you've mixed the ingredients, transfer the mixture to a measuring cup or another container with a pour spout. Pour enough of the egg mixture to fill all of the cups into the muffin tin. The quiches will puff up as they bake so don't fill the the cups to the brim. Aim for 1 to 2 inches (2.5- to 5-cm) from the top. Top each mini quiche with Swiss cheese. After you've filled the muffin tins, use \u00bd cup (53 g) of shredded Swiss Cheese to top all of the quiches. Add a small pinch of the cheese to each cup. You can substitute your favorite cheese for the Swiss if you prefer. Cheddar and mozzarella are good options. Bake the quiches until the tops are brown. Place the muffin tins in the heated oven. Allow them to bake for approximately 15 minutes, and then rotate the pans. Let the quiches cook for another 15 minutes or until the tops become golden brown. The quiches will also puff up when they're finished baking. Transfer the quiches to a cooling rack to cool. As soon as you take the muffin tins out of the oven, run a sharp knife around each quiche. Turn the tray over to remove the quiches, and place them on a wire rack to cool. Let the quiche cool for at least 5 minutes. You can serve them warm, but you don't want them so hot that they'll burn you. Arrange the quiches on a platter to serve. When the quiches are cool enough to handle, set them out on a platter. You can serve them warm or at room temperature. You can make the quiches the day before. Store them in the refrigerator, and reheat them in the microwave briefly before you plan to serve them. Preparing Stuffed Cherry Peppers Cut the cheese into pieces. Take \u00bc pound (113 g) of extra sharp auricchio provolone cheese and use a sharp knife to cut it into small pieces. You want the pieces to be small enough to fit inside the peppers so aim for 1-inch cubes. If you prefer, you can substitute mozzarella for the auricchio provolone. Wrap the cheese with the prosciutto. After you've cut the cheese into pieces, cut 5 slices of thin prosciutto in half. Next, place several cubes of the cheese in the center of each piece of prosciutto and wrap the ham around the cheese in a bundle. Stuff the wrapped cheese in the peppers. Use a knife to cut the stems off 10 spicy cherry peppers and scrape out the seeds to create a well. Place one of the prosciutto and provolone bundles in each pepper to fill it. If you aren't a fan of spicy foods, you can substitute cherry tomatoes for the peppers. Marinate the peppers in olive oil overnight. Place the stuffed peppers in a bowl, and pour \u00bd cup (118 ml) of extra virgin olive oil over them. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the peppers. Allow them to marinate in the oil overnight. Bring the peppers to room temperature and transfer them to a platter. An hour or two before you plan to serve the peppers, remove the bowl from the refrigerator and set them out to come to room temperature. Place them on a platter to serve. You may want to serve the stuffed peppers with toothpicks. The oil makes them greasy so they can be slightly messy to pick up with fingers.",
