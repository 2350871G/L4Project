Keep whisking until all of the dry ingredients are combined and set the bowl aside. The pinch of salt will deepen the flavor of the sponge cake."

          "description":"Crack 4 eggs into a large mixing bowl. Use a stand or hand mixer to beat the eggs on medium speed until they turn pale yellow.Tip: Use room-temperature eggs to get the most volume when you beat the eggs. Set the eggs out for 30 minutes before using them in the recipe."

Continue to mix until you don't see any lumps or pockets of sugar. If you can find it, use caster sugar for an even finer-textured sponge cake."

Continue to do this until all of the dry ingredients are combined and you don't see any lumps.ref>https://www.familycircle.com/recipe/chocolate/ice-cream-cake-roll/</ref>\nEnsure that you don't stir the mixtures since this will knock the air out of the batter.

Then put the pan in the preheated oven and bake the sponge cake until it's just cooked throughout. To test if the cake is done, carefully tap the center of the cake with your fingertip.

Rolling from the shorter end will give your log the best spiral when you cut into it. Rolling the cake while it's warm will help it remember the shape.

Leave a 1 inch (2.5 cm) border around the edges.Tip: Try to work quickly with assembly since your ice cream will continue to soften and begin to melt.
