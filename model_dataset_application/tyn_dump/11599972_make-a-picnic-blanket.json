          "description":"You can make your blanket however big you\u2019d like. Typically, picnic blankets are roughly 82 inches (210 cm) in length and 55 inches (140 cm) in width. Sketch the dimensions of your blanket out and write the size down so you can reference the size when you go to purchase your fabric. If you want to visualize how big a blanket will end up being, lay down 2 measuring tapes on the ground based on your planned length and width. You can make a square-shaped blanket if you prefer, but most people prefer blankets with a short side to make the blanket easier to roll up and store."

          "headline":"Select a durable fabric with a beautiful pattern for your blanket.",
          "description":"You can use any kind of fabric to make a picnic blanket, but comfortable water-resistant textiles like polyester fleece, microfiber, and wool will work best. Choose a pattern that looks interesting you. You can choose any color that you\u2019d like, but bright summer colors like red, green, purple, or orange will work well.Tip: The popular checkered picnic blanket pattern is known as gingham. While many picnic blankets today use the checkerboard pattern, most blankets aren\u2019t made of gingham since it tends to be a little rougher than other fabrics. Soft denim is another popular fabric for DIY blankets. If you want a reversible blanket with a different pattern on both sides, get 2 different patterns or colors. You can get a quilted picnic blanket pattern if you\u2019d like to give your blanket a traditional look. If you\u2019re feeling ambitious, you can get a variety of fabrics and sew the quilt together yourself. This is much more difficult and time-consuming, though."

          "description":"If you want your picnic blanket to be  82 by 55 in (210 by 140 cm), get at least enough fabric for a blanket that is 175 by 120 inches (440 by 300 cm). This way, you\u2019ll be able to fold the fabric in half to increase the thickness of your blanket. It will also give you some extra fabric to work with in the event that you accidentally tear some of it. Buy your fabric online or at a local craft shop. If you want to fill the blanket with padding or if you\u2019re using a thick material, like denim, you can purchase less fabric. It\u2019s still good to have some extra fabric though. If you\u2019re going to use padding, purchase cotton batting or upholstery foam."

Purchase a sheet of soft vinyl big enough to cover your blanket on one side. Vinyl isn\u2019t a particularly comfortable material to sit or lay on, so don\u2019t use a vinyl back if you want your blanket to be reversible."

          "description":"Set your fabric out face-down on a large, flat surface. Use heavy objects or clamps to keep the fabric taut. Use a measuring tape to measure the length of each side of your blanket. To mark each cut, set a yardstick or some other straight edge out on your fabric. Use the edge to draw your length and width out using fabric chalk. You can use a fabric marker instead of the chalk if you prefer, but the chalk is much easier to erase. Repeat this process for the second layer of fabric that you\u2019re using. You will sew the 2 pieces of fabric together after cutting them out. If your fabric is thinner and you\u2019re going to fold it over, double the dimensions of your blanket. This is a good idea if you\u2019re using a thin fabric, like polyester. If you\u2019re installing a vinyl cover on one side of the blanket to keep water out, spread the vinyl sheet out first. After you cut your fabric, trace the shape of the blanket on the vinyl and cut it separately."

          "headline":"Cut the fabric using sewing scissors or a rotary cutter.",
          "description":"If you have a steady hand, feel free to cut your fabric out with sewing scissors. Alternatively, set a cutting mat out underneath the fabric and use a rotary cutter to carve clean lines. Cut carefully along each of the lines that you\u2019ve marked to cut your fabric out. Work slowly to ensure that you don\u2019t accidentally deviate from the marks that you\u2019ve made. If you cut into the fabric of your blanket, you\u2019ll need to repeat this process. Cut the vinyl separately if you\u2019re using a waterproof cover on one of the blanket\u2019s sides. Depending on the thickness of the vinyl, you may be able to cut it with standard scissors. Otherwise, use a rotary cutter."

          "description":"If you\u2019re filling your blanket with some kind of padding, set your material out in the middle of your fabric. Spread it out by hand or unroll the padding until you\u2019re happy with the thickness of the material. You can add as many layers of padding as you\u2019d like. Distribute the padding evenly so that it is flush with the edges of your first layer of fabric.Tip: Avoid using fluffy padding materials if possible. The softer the padding, the more likely it bundle up inside of your blanket and make it lumpy. Filling the blanket with padding is entirely optional. You can fill it if you want the blanket to be fluffy and soft, but many people prefer thinner picnic blankets. If you cut out fabric that is twice as big as the dimensions of the blanket, grip a corner of the fabric. Fold it over to the corner of the opposite side to make it thicker before adding any padding."

          "description":"Once your corners are lined up, use sewing pins to secure the fabric in place so that it doesn\u2019t spread around while you sew it. Go around the edges of your fabric and insert 1 pin every 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm). Place your pins 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) from the exterior edge of each side. Push the pin through one side of the fabric and run it through the opposite side. Repeat this process until you\u2019ve lined every side of your blanket. You can fold each edge over itself before pinning the layers in place if you\u2019d like a cleaner edge. If you do this, iron the edges in place before pinning it."

          "headline":"Stitch the edges of your blanket with a strong thread to secure it.",
          "description":"Run a strong thread through your sewing machine and set a corner of your blanket under the machine. Plug the machine in and set the speed on your machine to its lowest setting. Press the foot pedal or use the automatic setting to stitch the blanket. Move the fabric as you sew by pulling it towards you slowly. Repeat this process on each side to finish sewing the edges. A running stitch is the easiest pattern to use here, but you can use a zigzag stitch if you prefer. Do this 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) away from your pins to avoid stitching them into your blanket or damaging your machine. You can do this by hand if you\u2019d like. If you do, run your thread through each side of the blanket to stitch a zigzag into each of the edges. Sew additional seams through the middle of your blanket if you filled the blanket with padding. Place 1 seam every 1\u20132 feet (30\u201361 cm) running lengthwise and widthwise through your blanket. This will keep the padding from shifting around. Remove the pins when you\u2019re done sewing the blanket."

          "headline":"Sew bias tape around the edges of your blanket to secure the stitching.",
          "description":"Purchase a spool of bias tape from your local fabric or craft store. Spread the tape out and open the fold in the middle. Place the end of your tape along a corner of your blanket so that the crease meets the seam of the fabric. Fold it around the seam and pin it place. Sew along the edge of each length of tape to secure it to the blanket. Run your pins 0.5\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm) away from the edge of your bias tape where it meets the main fabric of the blanket. Place 1 pin every 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) to keep the tape from sliding around. Bias tape is a sewing material that is used for securing stitches and keep edges safe. It looks like a thin roll of fabric that is folded in half lengthwise. You can skip the bias tape and simply trim any frayed edges with sewing scissors if you prefer."

Nylon is the best choice for your straps but you can use another strong fabric if you prefer. Purchase strips in a pattern and color that will work well with your blanket. Make sure that the Velcro strips are designed to stick on fabric by reading the label carefully before purchasing them. If you can\u2019t find Velcro strips that will work with fabric, you can sew standard Velcro strips into the blanket instead. Get straps that are 29\u201336 inches (74\u201391 cm) long so that they can wrap all the way around your blanket when you roll it up. You do not have to add straps if you don\u2019t want to.

Place the 2 strips out 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2 cm) from the top of the roll on the shorter side of the blanket and 10\u201320 inches (25\u201351 cm) in from the exterior edges. Peel the adhesive backing off and carefully press the back into your fabric or iron them into place. You do not need to fold the blanket up before rolling it up.

Place a hash mark with fabric chalk where you want to put your straps. If you want to make things simple, you can cut the straps at the point where they wrap around the blanket and meet your Velcro after 1 rotation.

    "After you cut your fabric, trace the shape of the blanket on the vinyl and cut it separately.",
    "Cut the fabric using sewing scissors or a rotary cutter.",
    "If you have a steady hand, feel free to cut your fabric out with sewing scissors.",
    "Alternatively, set a cutting mat out underneath the fabric and use a rotary cutter to carve clean lines.",
    "Cut carefully along each of the lines that you\u2019ve marked to cut your fabric out.",
    "Work slowly to ensure that you don\u2019t accidentally deviate from the marks that you\u2019ve made.",
    "If you cut into the fabric of your blanket, you\u2019ll need to repeat this process.",
    "Cut the vinyl separately if you\u2019re using a waterproof cover on one of the blanket\u2019s sides.",
    "Depending on the thickness of the vinyl, you may be able to cut it with standard scissors.",
    "Otherwise, use a rotary cutter.",
    "Spread a layer of padding or cotton batting out if you\u2019re filling the blanket.",
    "If you\u2019re filling your blanket with some kind of padding, set your material out in the middle of your fabric.",
    "Spread it out by hand or unroll the padding until you\u2019re happy with the thickness of the material.",
    "You can add as many layers of padding as you\u2019d like.",
    "Distribute the padding evenly so that it is flush with the edges of your first layer of fabric.Tip: Avoid using fluffy padding materials if possible.",
    "The softer the padding, the more likely it bundle up inside of your blanket and make it lumpy.",
    "Filling the blanket with padding is entirely optional.",
    "You can fill it if you want the blanket to be fluffy and soft, but many people prefer thinner picnic blankets.",
    "If you cut out fabric that is twice as big as the dimensions of the blanket, grip a corner of the fabric.",
    "Fold it over to the corner of the opposite side to make it thicker before adding any padding.",
    "Set your 2 layers of fabric on top of one another.",
    "Take your second piece of fabric and set it on top of the first sheet with the pattern facing up.",
    "Line the corners up and pull the fabric taut before clamping it in place.",
    "Alternatively, you can set heavy objects near the corners after matching them up and setting them down.",
    "Pin the fabric in place to keep the layers from sliding around.",
    "Once your corners are lined up, use sewing pins to secure the fabric in place so that it doesn\u2019t spread around while you sew it.",
    "Go around the edges of your fabric and insert 1 pin every 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm).",
    "Place your pins 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) from the exterior edge of each side.",
    "Push the pin through one side of the fabric and run it through the opposite side.",
    "Repeat this process until you\u2019ve lined every side of your blanket.",
    "You can fold each edge over itself before pinning the layers in place if you\u2019d like a cleaner edge.",
    "If you do this, iron the edges in place before pinning it.",
    "Stitch the edges of your blanket with a strong thread to secure it.",
    "Run a strong thread through your sewing machine and set a corner of your blanket under the machine.",
    "Plug the machine in and set the speed on your machine to its lowest setting.",
    "Press the foot pedal or use the automatic setting to stitch the blanket.",
    "Move the fabric as you sew by pulling it towards you slowly.",
    "Repeat this process on each side to finish sewing the edges.",
    "A running stitch is the easiest pattern to use here, but you can use a zigzag stitch if you prefer.",
    "Do this 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) away from your pins to avoid stitching them into your blanket or damaging your machine.",
    "You can do this by hand if you\u2019d like.",
    "If you do, run your thread through each side of the blanket to stitch a zigzag into each of the edges.",
    "Sew additional seams through the middle of your blanket if you filled the blanket with padding.",
    "Place 1 seam every 1\u20132 feet (30\u201361 cm) running lengthwise and widthwise through your blanket.",
    "This will keep the padding from shifting around.",
    "Remove the pins when you\u2019re done sewing the blanket.",
    "Sew bias tape around the edges of your blanket to secure the stitching.",
    "Purchase a spool of bias tape from your local fabric or craft store.",
    "Spread the tape out and open the fold in the middle.",
    "Place the end of your tape along a corner of your blanket so that the crease meets the seam of the fabric.",
    "Fold it around the seam and pin it place.",
    "Sew along the edge of each length of tape to secure it to the blanket.",
    "Run your pins 0.5\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm) away from the edge of your bias tape where it meets the main fabric of the blanket.",
    "Place 1 pin every 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) to keep the tape from sliding around.",
    "Bias tape is a sewing material that is used for securing stitches and keep edges safe.",
    "It looks like a thin roll of fabric that is folded in half lengthwise.",
    "You can skip the bias tape and simply trim any frayed edges with sewing scissors if you prefer.",
    "Adding Storage Straps Get Velcro strips and some strong nylon straps.",
    "If you want to make a roll-up picnic blanket, purchase 2 heavy-duty Velcro strips with adhesive backing.",
    "Nylon is the best choice for your straps but you can use another strong fabric if you prefer.",
    "Purchase strips in a pattern and color that will work well with your blanket.",
    "Make sure that the Velcro strips are designed to stick on fabric by reading the label carefully before purchasing them.",
    "If you can\u2019t find Velcro strips that will work with fabric, you can sew standard Velcro strips into the blanket instead.",
    "Get straps that are 29\u201336 inches (74\u201391 cm) long so that they can wrap all the way around your blanket when you roll it up.",
    "You do not have to add straps if you don\u2019t want to.",
    "They\u2019ll make it easy to store and carry your blanket, though.",
    "Roll your blanket up and stick the Velcro backs onto it.",
    "To determine where you want to place your strips, roll your blanket up so that the backside of the blanket is facing out.",
    "Then, select 2 locations for your strips.",
    "Place the 2 strips out 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2 cm) from the top of the roll on the shorter side of the blanket and 10\u201320 inches (25\u201351 cm) in from the exterior edges.",
    "Peel the adhesive backing off and carefully press the back into your fabric or iron them into place.",
    "You do not need to fold the blanket up before rolling it up.",
    "However, if you plan on folding and storing your blanket a particular way, feel free to adjust this process by folding the blanket before rolling it.",
    "Adhere the Velcro to the end of each nylon strap.",
    "Take your first nylon strap and stick the other end of the Velcro strip at the end of the strap.",
    "Repeat this process on the other nylon strap.",
    "If you sewed the straps to your blanket, sew them to the straps instead to ensure that the tension on each piece of fabric is roughly the same.",
    "Roll the blanket up and determine where to place your straps.",
    "Roll the blanket up tight and hold it in place.",
    "Then, use the Velcro strips to attach each strap to your blanket.",
    "Next, wrap the straps around your blanket to find out where you need to attach them to keep the blanket tight when you roll it up.",
    "Place a hash mark with fabric chalk where you want to put your straps.",
    "If you want to make things simple, you can cut the straps at the point where they wrap around the blanket and meet your Velcro after 1 rotation.",
    "This way, you can sew the strap directly under the Velcro strip on your blanket.",
    "Pin and sew the straps into the blanket.",
    "Place your strap against the blanket where you made the hash mark and pin the strap in place.",
    "Then, use your sewing machine to stitch the nylon strap into your blanket.",
    "This way, when you roll the blanket up you can simply push the Velcro strips together to keep it from coming unraveled.",
    "Repeat this process with the other strap.Variation: Alternatively, you can add another set of Velcro strips where you want to place your straps and attach a second set of corresponding strips on the straps.",
    "Then you can take the straps on and off as you please."
