Pour in a little beef stock or red wine, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan, and stir with a wooden spoon. This will deglaze the pan, scraping up any delicious browned bits on the bottom to add to the flavor. Red wine, beef stock or even water will work when deglazing a pan. Choose something that you like the taste of. Red wine will add some extra richness, beef stock will complement the flavor of the meat, and water will let you add your own flavors. Try combining different liquids for a more complex flavor. If you want to add any vegetables to the meal, you should do so before deglazing the pan. Cut your vegetables into bite-sized pieces and cook them until soft and aromatic. Peppers, mushrooms, onion, and carrot would all make great additions,"

You can also leave your steak to simmer in the oven rather than on the stovetop.

Perfectly braised meat should be easily pulled apart with two forks, referred to as being \u201cfork-tender\u201d. Check your steak after around 1 hour to see if it is cooked. The time it takes to cook your round steak will vary based on the cut and how thick it is. After the first hour, check your steak every 30 minutes or so until it is done."

Cook it over a high temperature until the sauce reduces, or add cornstarch to thicken it to your desired consistency."

    "Cover the steak with a layer of salt that is just thick enough so you cannot see the meat.",
    "Use a coarse salt, such as kosher or a coarse sea salt to salt your steak.",
    "Table salt or something similar will be more difficult to remove from the steak and will make your steak too salty.",
    "Press the salt into the surface of the steak.",
    "Using one hand or the back of a spoon, start lightly rubbing the salt into the steak.",
    "You shouldn\u2019t be using the coarseness of the salt to tenderize the meat, only making sure that all parts of the steak are touching some salt.",
    "The salt will draw out some of the moisture in the steak, concentrating the flavor of the meat and curing it slightly before you cook it.",
    "Flip the steak over and repeat on the other side.",
    "In order to get the most flavor and tenderness from the meat, you should salt both sides of your steak.",
    "Lift the steak up and turn it over to salt the other side, being careful not to rub off too much of the salt that is already there.",
    "Store the steak in the fridge for around 1 hour per inch (2.5cm) of thickness.",
    "Place the salted steak in the refrigerator to let the salt begin tenderizing the meat.",
    "As a rough guide, you should let the steak sit for roughly 1 hour per inch of thickness of the steak.",
    "If it\u2019s 1 \u20444 inches (3.2 cm) thick, for example, leave the steak for around 1 hour and 15 minutes.",
    "Don\u2019t let the steak sit for too much longer than it needs to.",
    "If you leave it for too long, you may cure your steak rather than tenderizing it, which will change the texture.",
    "Scrape away the salt and cook your steak.",
    "After the salted steak has been left to sit, use a butter knife or something similar to scrape away as much salt as you can.",
    "Rinse the steak under some cold water to wash away any remaining salt and pat it completely dry with a few paper towels.",
    "Cook your steak in a skillet, frying pan, or griddle over a medium-high heat for 4-5 minutes on each side.",
    "When seasoning your steak, you shouldn\u2019t add any more salt.",
    "There will be enough salt residue on the steak to flavor it and any extra may leave you with a very salty steak.",
    "Using a Marinade Pour \u20444 cup (59 ml) of oil into a blender.",
    "This will make the base of the marinade, so use whichever type of oil you like the taste of.",
    "Olive oil is a great choice, but vegetable, peanut, or canola oil will all work as well.",
    "Add \u20444 cup (59 ml) of the oil to the jug of a blender.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a blender, you can make your marinade in a small bowl.",
    "Make sure you cut all of your ingredients very finely and mix them together well.",
    "Add 3 to 4 tablespoons (45-60ml) of vinegar.",
    "The acidity of the vinegar will help break down the steak to make it more tender.",
    "Red wine vinegar will complement the meat well, but you could also use apple cider or white vinegar if you prefer.",
    "Add 3 tablespoons (45ml) of vinegar to the oil, or 4 tablespoons (60ml) if you want a stronger marinade.",
    "The most important part of the vinegar in this context is its acidity, so you can use anything acidic in its place.",
    "The juice of a lemon or lime could also work fantastically and provide a slightly fresher flavor.",
    "Mix in any herbs and spices you like.",
    "With the base of the marinade made, you can add in whichever other flavors you want.",
    "Try adding in 1/2 teaspoon (2g) of salt, 1 tablespoon (4g) of dried thyme, 3 cloves of peeled garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon (0.5g) of ground red pepper for a simple yet delicious marinade.",
    "If you are using a blender, you don\u2019t need to cut up the herbs or garlic as they will be finely chopped as the marinade is blended.",
    "If you are working by hand, mince the garlic and chop any herbs you want to add very finely.",
    "The flavors you add to your marinade are entirely up to you.",
    "Garlic, rosemary, thyme, paprika, and red pepper will all go great with a classic steak.",
    "See what other flavor combinations you can come up with!",
    "Blend your marinade until it is fully combined.",
    "Put the lid on the blender and turn it on to a high speed for around a minute.",
    "Keep processing it until any herbs are finely chopped and the vinegar and oil emulsify slightly to combine.",
    "Pulse the blender once or twice more once it's done to catch any herbs that haven\u2019t been cut fully.",
    "Place your steak and marinade in a zip-lock bag.",
    "Transfer your meat into a fitting zip-lock bag and carefully pour over your prepared marinade.",
    "Seal the bag firmly and use your hands to massage the steak slightly, so as to make sure the marinade is covering all of the meat.",
    "If you do not have or don\u2019t want to use a zip-lock bag, you can put your steak in a small bowl and cover it with the marinade.",
    "You may need to turn the steak over as you let it marinate to make sure all sides are evenly coated.",
    "Let the round steak marinate for at least 2 hours in the fridge.",
    "Put the zip-lock bag with your marinade and steak into the refrigerator for at least two hours to begin marinating.",
    "The acid in the vinegar will start eating into the meat, breaking it down and tenderizing it while adding more flavor.",
    "You can leave your steak in the marinade for longer to give it more flavor.",
    "However, if left too long, the acid will break down the steak too much and ruin the structure of it.",
    "Don\u2019t leave the steak marinating for more than 6 hours.",
    "Take your steak out of the marinade and cook it.",
    "Remove the zip-lock bag from the fridge and let the steak come up to room temperature.",
    "Lift the steak out of the marinade and cook it on a skillet, frying pan, or griddle over a medium-high heat for around 5 minutes on either side.",
    "Once you are done with the marinade, you should immediately dispose of it.",
    "Seal the ziplock bag and throw it away."
