  "text":" Cut a piece of the muslin large enough for your selected design.  Lay the muslin on top of the pattern.  Lightly trace the pattern onto your muslin. A light box can make this faster and easier. Pin the fabric to the pattern to keep it from sliding as you trace.  Use a washable marker to make small dots to indicate the placement of the colonial knots and any other embroidery stitches used in the design.  Check to be certain that you have transferred the entire Candlewicking pattern to the muslin and haven't missed anything.  Remove the pins and set the pattern aside.  Place the fabric in an embroidery hoop.  Thread the embroidery needle with 4 strands of Candlewicking thread or 6-12 strands of embroidery floss. The amount of floss you use will determine how large your colonial knots will be. Tie a knot in the thread or floss and stitch your first colonial knot. If this is your first Candlewicking design, practice making colonial knots on a small piece of muslin before you begin.
