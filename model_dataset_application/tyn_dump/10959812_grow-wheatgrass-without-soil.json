For best results, you\u2019ll need to cover your growing medium with a thick carpet of seeds, so buy enough seeds for the number of trays you\u2019ll plant.Choosing the right amount of seed: As a rule of thumb, use about 1 cup, or \u00bd lb (225 g), of wheatgrass seeds per 8 in (20 cm) of tray diameter. You can store seeds in a cool, dark, dry spot for up to 2 years, so spoilage isn\u2019t a major concern if you buy, for instance, a 5 lb (2.3 kg) bag."

Cover the top with cheesecloth, secure the cloth with a rubber band or the jar\u2019s collar ring, and cap the jar with its lid. Gently shake the jar for a few seconds to rinse the seeds, then remove the lid and drain the water through the cheesecloth. Preferably, use filtered water instead of tap to avoid introducing chemicals or microscopic organisms. If you don\u2019t have cheesecloth handy, pour the water through a fine mesh strainer or colander. Catch the seeds in the strainer, then return them to the jar.

If you don\u2019t see sprouts after 3 cycles, drain the water and replace the jar\u2019s lid. The jar should be drained, but you should keep the seeds moist; if necessary, mist them periodically.

Mix cool or lukewarm filtered water and liquid kelp fertilizer according to your product\u2019s instructions, then spray the growing medium just enough to moisten it. Find liquid kelp fertilizer online or at a garden center. Mixing ratios vary, so check your product\u2019s label for instructions and use it as directed. A general guideline is to use 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of fertilizer per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. The growing medium should be damp, but not soggy.
