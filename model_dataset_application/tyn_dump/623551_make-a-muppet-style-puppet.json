Your puppet can be green, purple, or any other color you want! You can buy fleece of all different colors and patterns at your local fabric store, or online. Avoid getting \u201cminky\u201d fleece.

The pattern will look like a long rectangle for the neck, and a circle for the head with a triangle cut out for the open mouth. Make sure to trace the 2 little triangles going into the top of the head. The little triangles in the top of the head are called darts. They should be about 1 inch (2.5cm) in height.

Then cut your thread, move over to the new place you want to sew, and start again. Your hand will go in the bottom of the neck to control the puppet, so you definitely don\u2019t want to sew it closed!
