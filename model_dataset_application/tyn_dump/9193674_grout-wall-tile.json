  "text":" Preparing Your Work Area Put on safety protection. Use rubber gloves, eye protection, older clothes that cover your arms, and a smock. If you don\u2019t put on safety protection, you could potentially hurt yourself. This is especially true for eye protection, as you may get grout in your eyes without it. Make sure the room you\u2019re working in is properly ventilated. To do this, open nearby windows and doors. If you have a bathroom vent, turn it on. Tape plastic covers to surrounding walls and floors. Use painters tape to secure plastic to the area directly underneath where you\u2019ll be working with grout. In addition, place plastic next to the portion of the wall you\u2019ll be working on. This will protect these areas from grout spills or stains. Remove tile spacers from in-between the tiles.

Do this by moving your float in a circular fashion through the grout. If you don\u2019t mix the grout regularly, it will wind up setting and you won\u2019t be able to work with it. Spreading the Grout Pick a 3 ft \u00d7 3 ft (0.91 m \u00d7 0.91 m) section. After you\u2019ve set up, don\u2019t just start grouting the entire wall. First, divide the wall up into manageable sections that are about 3 ft \u00d7 3 ft (0.91 m \u00d7 0.91 m). This way, you\u2019ll be able to finish one section before the grout completely dries.

Use a plastic drywall knife if you\u2019re working in a small area, such as when adding a backsplash in a kitchen. Float more grout in a diagonal fashion. Position your float at a 45-degree angle to the tiles and spread your grout liberally into the joints. The joints are the spaces between your tiles. Push as much grout into the joints as possible.

For example, you can use a toothbrush handle. Don\u2019t use a metal tool. This could damage the tile. Cleaning the Tiled Surface Fill a bucket with clean water. Get a 2-gallon (7.6 l) bucket and fill it up with water. While you can use warm water, cool water will work well in most circumstances. This water will be used to help clean excess grout off the tile. If you\u2019ll be grouting a large wall area, you may want to fill two buckets up. Use a sponge to wipe off excess grout.
