Find the best stalk of what\u2019s available for the best taste. Choose stalks that are light green fading to yellow, with reddish-brown patches. Avoid ones that are white, cracked, or blackened in some areas. Pick up stalks in your hand to feel the weight. Favor thinner, heavier stalks over thicker, lighter ones for more moisture. Also choose a stalk with longer jointed sections for easier cutting and eating. Ask a produce clerk to make a cut at either end of a stalk for you. Pick one that has off-white, moist, opaque flesh inside. Avoid dry flesh that is brown or red in color."

It will be easiest to cut through sections of the stalk in between the thicker joints. Keep in mind, however, that the sections between the joints will also be the easiest to chew or use for other purposes, so it\u2019s best to keep them intact. You can also cut the stalk lengthwise into two, four, or more thinner sticks for consumption. Do this before cutting off the outer layer, or afterwards if it\u2019s easier to do so."

Cut in about a millimeter from the edge, or wherever you see that the tougher green bark is distinguished from the inner white flesh. You may be able to peel the outer layer down and off the stalk with your fingers after making an initial cut, depending on how easily your cane\u2019s bark separates from the flesh."

Cut sugar cane pieces into thin sticks with a sharp point on one or both ends for optimal use as a skewer. You can leave the bark on for greater strength when skewering tougher foods.

Try dropping a stick into unsweetened tea. You can leave it in hot or iced tea for a few minutes to extract the sweetness, or just enjoy the gradual sweetening of the stick stirred in over time. Use a sugar cane swizzle stick in a rum-based cocktail like a mojito or planter\u2019s punch for a gentle sweetener."
