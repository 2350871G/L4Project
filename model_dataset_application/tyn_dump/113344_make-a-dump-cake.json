  "text":" Making a Blueberry Dump Cake Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).  Dump the blueberries, sugar, and cinnamon into the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters) baking pan. Give the ingredients a stir with a rubber spatula  to combine them evenly. You can also use a different type of berry instead, such as sliced strawberries, raspberries, or blackberries.

Let the dump cake cool for about 10 to 15 minutes before serving. You can also chill the cake afterwards, and serve it cold. If you'd like, serve it alongside some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

You can serve it as it is, or add a dollop of whipped cream (or even vanilla ice cream) for extra moisture. Making a Slow-Cooker Dump Cake Lightly grease the inside of your slow-cooker. You can use butter or cooking spray. Add the sliced apples, cranberries, vanilla extract, brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Stir the ingredients together until they are evenly combined.

Once the cake is ready, turn off the slow-cooker and pull of the lid. Let the cake cool for about 10 to 15 minutes before serving it.

    "Bake the dump cake for 40 to 45 minutes, then let it cool for about 10 to 15 minutes.",
    "You do not need to take it out of the baking pan.",
    "Instead, plan on serving it straight from the pan instead.",
    "Serve the dump cake.",
    "Thanks to the pudding base, the cake will be very rich and moist.",
    "If you'd like it to be even more moist, however, you could add a dollop of whipped cream, or even a scoop of vanilla ice cream instead.",
    "Making a Vanilla Dump Cake from Scratch Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).",
    "Grease a two 8-inch (20.32 centimeters) round cake pans.",
    "You can do this using butter or cooking spray.",
    "Set the pan aside when you are done.",
    "Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large mixing bowl.",
    "This will help break up any lumps or clumps, and give you a smoother cake batter.",
    "Add the butter, milk, and vanilla extract.",
    "Cut the butter into cubes first, before adding it into the bowl; this will make mixing easier.",
    "Also, make sure that the butter is soft, but not melted.",
    "Beat the ingredients together using a hand mixer on medium speed for 3 to 4 minutes.",
    "You can also use an electric, stand mixer or even a food processor fitted with whisks.",
    "In a pinch, you can also use a plain old whisk, but it will take longer.",
    "Keep mixing until everything is evenly combined.",
    "Add the eggs, and beat the batter for another 3 minutes.",
    "Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl from time to time to ensure that you mix all of the ingredients.",
    "If you are doing this completely by hand, keep mixing until the eggs are completely blended in, and no streaks or swirls of egg yolk remain.",
    "Pour the batter into the pans, then bake the cakes for 30 to 35 minutes.",
    "Use a rubber spatula to scrape every last bit of batter out of the bowl and into the pans.",
    "The cakes are ready when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.",
    "Cool the cakes.",
    "Let the cakes cool in their pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes first.",
    "Then, remove the cakes from the pans and let them finish cooling completely before frosting them.",
    "The cakes must be completely cool, or else the frosting will melt.",
    "Prepare the whipped cream frosting.",
    "In a mixing bowl, stir together the heavy cream, vanilla extract, and sugar; do not whisk the cream yet.",
    "Chill the cream in the fridge for 30 minutes, then beat it with an electric mixer on medium speed until you get stiff peaks.",
    "You can also use your own frosting instead.",
    "Buttercream frosting will taste delightful, but store-bought frosting will also do.",
    "Assemble and frost the cake.",
    "Place one of the cakes onto a serving plate, and use a butter knife or an off-set cake decorating spatula to spread a thick layer of frosting on top.",
    "Place the second layer of cake on top of that.",
    "Use the rest of the frosting to cover the top and sides of the cake.",
    "Add some sliced strawberries between the cake layers for extra flavor.",
    "If you have any frosting left over, you can make little \"stars\" on top using a piping bag and a star-shaped decorator's tip.",
    "Garnish the cake with some sliced strawberries for more color."
