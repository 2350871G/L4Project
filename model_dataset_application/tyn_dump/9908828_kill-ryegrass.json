If you're applying herbicides outside of the ideal application window, use 2.25 pounds (36.0 oz) ae per acre of glyphosate. Labels on herbicide containers often use \"a.i.\" or \"a.e\" as units of measurement for the herbicide's \"active ingredient\" or \"acid equivalent, respectively. A mixture of 1 ounce (0.063 lb) per acre of herbicide with 700 g/kg saflufenacil with 1.25 pounds (20.0 oz) per acre of glyphosate is the most consistently effective way of controlling ryegrass across any application window. Adding 2,4-D and dicamba to your mix does not improve efficacy of glyphosate alone. The addition of a PS-II inhibiting herbicide (atrazine and metribuzin) can interfere with glyphosate and stop your herbicide mix from working. Effective lyphosate-free herbicide mixes should use paraquat in addition to metribuzin and either 2,4-D or dicamba. However, this combination is only suggested for ryegrass less than 6 inches (15 cm) tall. Make sure the herbicide mix is compatible with your herbicide sprayer.
