Go over the floor beneath the blinds with the vacuum when you\u2019re done to suck up any loose dust that has drifted off the blinds.

The towel should be just slightly damp to help dust stick to it without wetting the blinds. Avoid using abrasive cleaners on blinds, even the synthetic types. Harsh chemicals can eat through the finish of the slats. Wooden blinds, especially, should not get too wet. Standing water can soak into the wood and cause it to warp and discolor."

Stop and rinse the towel after every few slats to wash away the dust and grime that has built up on it. You may be surprised how much dirt you\u2019ll pick up cleaning this way!
