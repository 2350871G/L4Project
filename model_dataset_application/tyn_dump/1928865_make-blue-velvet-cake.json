    "Prepare the crumb coat by diluting \u2153 to \u00bd cup (75 to 115 grams) of icing with some milk.",

    "Apply two layers of the diluted icing, letting each layer set before adding the next.",
    "Use an offset spatula to coat the entire cake with a thin layer of the diluted frosting.",
    "Let the cake chill in the fridge for 15 minutes before adding a second coat.",

    "If you added parchment/wax paper strips under your cake, carefully pull them out once you are done.",
    "EXPERT TIP\tIf you opt to leave the frosting plain, consider decorating with an assortment of blue sprinkles in different shades and styles.",
