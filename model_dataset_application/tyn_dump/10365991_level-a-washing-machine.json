          "description":"Washing machines have adjustable legs that can extend out several inches/centimeters as needed in order to level the machine. However, the machine will be more stable if the legs are extended as little as is necessary to level the washer. So, if you\u2019re installing a new washer or relocating an existing one, make sure all the adjustable legs are retracted fully before putting the machine in place. You want to extend short legs in order to level the machine, rather than shorten long legs. Extended legs are more wobbly and prone to breaking. New washing machines normally come with the legs fully retracted."

You can find more detailed directions for adjusting metal and plastic legs elsewhere in this wikiHow article. Some people prefer to reduce the pressure on the legs while adjusting them, out of concern that they might bend or snap.

  "text":" Levelling from Side-to-Side and Front-to-Back Start with the legs as short as possible when installing a washer. Washing machines have adjustable legs that can extend out several inches/centimeters as needed in order to level the machine.

You want to extend short legs in order to level the machine, rather than shorten long legs. Extended legs are more wobbly and prone to breaking. New washing machines normally come with the legs fully retracted. Lay a spirit level from side-to-side on top of the machine. The small bubble in a spirit level tells you if the surface is flat. There's a strong chance that the bubble will be off-center when you put it down, which confirms that your washing machine is uneven. Whichever side the bubble sways towards is higher off the ground. Your goal is to adjust the machine until the bubble stays in the center of the tube. If the top of your washing machine is curved, look for a flat area\u2014 like the top of the control panel or the seam between the top and the cabinet. Adjust one or both front legs until the spirit level bubble is centered. For metal legs, you\u2019ll loosen the locking nut with a wrench, then turn the leg clockwise (to shorten it) or counterclockwise (to extend it).

Then adjust the leg(s), remove the block, check for level, and repeat as needed. Level the machine from front-to-back (for self-levelling rear legs). Most modern washing machines have self-levelling legs in the back. So, if you turn your spirit level so it\u2019s facing front-to-back on top of the washer and the bubble is centered, you\u2019re all set. If it\u2019s not yet level front-to-back, try the following:\nLift the back of the washer about 1 in (2.5 cm) off the ground and let it drop back down.

Rock the levelled machine back and forth as a final check. Even once your machine is completely level, one of the legs may not be touching the floor. This can happen if the floor is uneven\u2014as might be the case for an old concrete slab in the basement.

Washing machines can move out of position and out of level over time. Adjusting a Metal Leg Loosen the locking nut with an adjustable wrench. Metal legs have a locking nut at the base of the leg, against the underside of the washing machine. Adjust the wrench until the jaws fit snugly against the locking nut, then turn the nut clockwise until it starts sliding down the leg. Stop once the nut is around 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) away from the washing machine\u2019s underside. To tighten an adjustable wrench, place the wrench\u2019s jaws over the locking nut, then adjust the winch on the side of the wrench until the jaws grip the nut. Turn the foot to lower or raise the leg. You should be able to adjust the foot by hand. Pinch it between two fingers and rotate it clockwise if you want to shorten the foot. Turn the foot counterclockwise if you want to extend the foot. It\u2019s best to make slight adjustments\u2014e.g., spinning the leg just 1 or 2 turns to lengthen or shorten it\u2014then check for level again, and repeat as needed. Tighten the locking nut with your adjustable wrench. Once you've reached your target leg length, you need to lock the nut in place to make the change permanent. Put the adjustable wrench's jaws over the nut, tighten the jaws if necessary, and rotate  the nut counterclockwise until it's tight against the base of the machine. Just hand-tighten the locking nut until it is snug. If you over-tighten it now, it will be difficult to loosen in the future. Making a Plastic Leg Longer or Shorter Adjust your pliers to fit the foot of the leg. Plastic legs are easier to adjust than metal ones, but it's difficult to do so by hand. Instead, grab some adjustable pliers and pull the handles of the pliers apart until the prongs are wide enough to grip the \u201cfeet\u201d (the wider base) of the washing machine leg.
