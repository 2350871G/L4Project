Besides improving their aroma, dry roasting tends to make spices more mellow and complex. The exact flavor change depends on the spice. Whether or not you toast the spices is a matter of taste, so feel free to experiment. Do not toast wet ingredients such as citrus or raw ginger."

Fruity flavors should be prominent, with no strong oak or tannic components that could turn the brew bitter. Try Cabernet Sauvignon, Bordeaux, or Pinot Noir. You can mull white wine, but it works better with lighter flavors, such as vanilla and elderflower cordial."
