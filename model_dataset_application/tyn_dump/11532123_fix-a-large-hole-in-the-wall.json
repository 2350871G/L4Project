The goal is to clean the hole up enough that the wall repair patch will sit flat on top of it with no loose debris or ragged paper edges pushing against it or interfering with the adhesive. This method works for holes that are up to about 6 in (15 cm) in diameter. Wall patches come in sizes up to 7\u20138 in (18\u201320 cm) in diameter, and the patch needs to be slightly bigger than the hole to adhere to the wall around it."

This will allow it to adhere firmly to the intact wall surrounding the hole. You can buy wall repair patches in different sizes, so you can also just buy one that is the right size. Wall repair patches are made of a mesh material that is able to support spackling on top of it."
