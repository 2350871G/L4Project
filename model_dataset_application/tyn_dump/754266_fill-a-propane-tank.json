If the valve has a triangular shape or has the letters OPD printed on it, then it\u2019s safe to fill. If it doesn\u2019t have have a triangular valve, then you cannot fill the tank safely. Some OPDs were made before they were required to have the letters printed on them. Check the label or wrapper on your tank if it has a triangular valve but doesn\u2019t have OPD printed on it."

If the tank has any damage on the outside, avoid filling it since it\u2019s less stable than a new tank. If the tank also has a coat of rust on the outside, don\u2019t use it or fill it since it could be unsafe.

Look around the collar of the tank, which is the raised round area surrounding the valve, for a listed in MM/YY format. If the tank is older than 12 years, then either replace or have it inspected by a professional propane service. Otherwise, the tank is safe to use. If your tank was recertified, there may be a second date printed on the collar with the letter E next to it. Use the most recent date rather than the first one printed. Get your propane tank recertified 12 years after the first printed date and every 5 years after."

Calculate 80% of the tank\u2019s capacity and add the tare weight to find how much your tank will weigh when it\u2019s full. When the tank reaches the weight you calculated, rotate the valves on both tanks clockwise to close them. For example, if your tank can hold 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of propane and the tare weight is 20 pounds (9.1 kg), stop filling the tank once the scale reads 35\u201336 pounds (16\u201316 kg)."
