Nice, clean cuts are essential to maintaining the health of the plant. If you don\u2019t have a pair of pruners handy, you could also use full-sized hedge clippers or trimmers. Whatever tool you use should be nice and sharp and able to make clean cuts. When you need to cut canes larger than about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) in diameter, switch to a set of larger loppers.

This helps promote new growths to grow outward rather than inward. This technique should be used regardless of the time of year or size of the growth you\u2019re pruning. Angled cuts help water run off the stem and reduces the chance of fungal rot.

A mature knockout rose should be about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall by 4 feet (1.2 m) wide before you begin hacking at it. A fully-grown knockout rose will require the most pruning around mid-February to early March. Young roses, by contrast, only need to be touched up throughout the growing period to remove dead or dying growth. Knockout roses can often go as long as 2-3 years between major prunings, depending on how rapidly they grow and how big or small you like to keep your plant."

The main pruning period for knockout roses is in late winter or early spring, just as the plant prepares for another season of growth. You can still prune your roses even if new growth has already begun. Buds might start forming early if the winter was especially mild. In this case, snip the growth back to the first dormant bud."

Creating some separation between the canes prevents them from rubbing against one other, making the plant look neater and promoting stronger, more lasting growth. By reducing the density of your rose bushes early in the season, you can make sure they continue putting out neat, attractive growth all year long. Thinning out overlapping canes and stems also promotes better air circulation through your rose bushes, making them less vulnerable to fungal diseases."

As a general rule, you\u2019ll want to cut them 1\u20132 feet (0.30\u20130.61 m) shorter than you would ultimately like them to end up. Be careful not to get too overzealous with your pruning.
