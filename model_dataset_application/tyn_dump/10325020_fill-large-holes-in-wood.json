  "text":" Preparing the Materials and Craft Sticks Gather your materials. Select water-based wood filler, primer, and paint if the item you are repairing is kept indoors, or solvent-based wood filler and oil-based primer and paint if the item will be placed outdoors. You'll also need craft sticks, disposable plates, PVA glue, wood glue, 120-grit sandpaper, and paintbrushes or rollers.
