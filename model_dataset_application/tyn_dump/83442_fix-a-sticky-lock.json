If your lock isn\u2019t in real bad shape, a little squirt of WD-40 will probably be all you need. WD-40 is generally a great product to have on hand whenever there\u2019s an immediate need for an all-purpose lubricant, although it will eventually dry out and need to be reapplied. Avoid using any lubricants that aren\u2019t appropriate for home improvement use, such as cooking, botanical or sewing machine oil.

If the lock still sticks a bit, you may need to try a more heavy-duty lubricant such as powdered graphite. Make sure you\u2019ve properly coated each part of the locking mechanism by running through the locking and unlocking action a few times. After you've applied WD-40 to the lock, the interior pins should disengage with no resistance and the cylinder should easily rotate when you turn your key.
