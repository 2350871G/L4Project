Put on an airtight pair of protective goggles, and find some thick gloves that will protect your hands before handling the fiberglass. Wear a dust mask to keep your mouth covered while you work. If you have a respirator, wear that instead of the dust mask. While it isn't essential, it will offer better protection than a standard dust mask."

Place your roll of insulation on a flat cutting surface.Tip: If you don't want to ruin the surface that you're going to be cutting on, put a sheet of plywood underneath your roll of insulation."

Place your straight edge so that it lines up with the section that you want to cut. If you're insulating uncovered walls and just finished framing them, you should have plenty of 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) joists left over. One of these will work just fine."

With the weight still placed on your straight edge, cut along the straight edge with your blade at a 45-degree angle. Drag the blade all the way through the bottom of the insulation and cut through your line. You can use a larger knife or machete if you don't have a retractable utility knife. Pull any loose fibers of chunks of insulation off with your gloved hand after you're done."

To do this, fold it along the corner where you want it to fit by pressing it down into the 90-degree corner where your joist and wall meet. Hold the excess section in your nondominant hand and cut directly along the corner where the insulation is folded. Insulation is easily compressed, so err on the conservative side when cutting like this. You can always force a slightly bigger piece into a small section."
