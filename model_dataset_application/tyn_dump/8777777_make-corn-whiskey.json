Turn the heat to high and heat the water until it reaches 165 degrees F (70 C). Turn off the heat.

Continue briefly stirring the corn every 5 minutes until the temperature reaches 152 degrees F (37 C). The corn will start to gel up when you stir it. This is because the starches are releasing and the mixture is thickening."

This corn mash will start to thin out after you've added the malted barley. It's important to use malted barley, since it has the enzymes you need to turn starch into sugar.

The water should be 110 degrees F (43 C). Stir in 1 teaspoon of sugar until the yeast and sugar are dissolved in the water. The yeast starter will ensure that the yeast is good and active before you add it to the mash. It will also get fermentation started right away."

Or you could scoop small amounts of the mash into a cheesecloth bag and squeeze the bag over the clean bucket. You can discard the grain solids. The liquid that you're left with after straining the solids is called wort. If you squeeze the corn mash in the cheesecloth bag, you can actually squeeze more liquid out of the mash which will get you more corn whiskey in the end."

Continue to pour the wort back and forth between the buckets, so you see bubbles and froth at the top of the liquid. You'll probably need to pour them between the buckets 10 to 15 times. Introducing air will give your yeast oxygen that it needs to grow."
