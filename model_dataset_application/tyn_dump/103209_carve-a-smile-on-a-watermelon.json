Use a pencil to draw a half-moon shape for an open-mouthed smile, or a thin curved line for a more subdued grin. Don't forget the eyes! Draw round eyes for a typical smiley face look or use long oval shapes to create a classic cartoon face look, similar to Mickey Mouse. If you want your watermelon face to have a nose, draw out a small circle or triangle between the eyes and mouth. You can even add eyelashes or dimples, if desired! You can look up pumpkin carving designs if you want to get a little more fancy with the face. Carving watermelons and carving pumpkins are remarkably similar processes, and you may find that most Halloween-style designs work perfectly on a watermelon rind."

Don't cut too much further than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), or your face may appear to be a little squished. If cutting this much from the top seems to be too much for the size of watermelon you have, just slice the top off at a point that exposes the insides of the watermelon. The important part isn't how much you cut away, rather it's making sure you can access it's flesh while giving plenty of room to carve a face in the front."

These can be used for decorations later on. Cutting the smile before the insides are removed can scramble and mush the watermelon's meat, reducing the number of watermelon balls you can harvest."
