Once you find the spot where you want to place the outlet, go inside your home and find the nearest outlet on the other side of the exterior wall. Be sure to choose an outlet that isn't switch-operated or else the exterior outlet won't work when you plug into it. If you don't have an inside outlet on the wall where you want the exterior outlet, then hire an electrician to run wires from your circuit box to the spot."

Put an outlet tester in the plug to see if it still has a current running through it. If none of the lights turn on when you plug the tester in, then it's disconnected from power and you can continue working. Try the outlet tester in a plug that you know works to make sure the tester functions properly. Never work on an outlet when it's still connected to power since you could electrocute yourself. If some of the lights still turn on when you plug the tester in, then the outlet is still live and you turned off the wrong breaker. Continue testing the breakers until the tester says the outlet has no power.Variation: You can also use a multimeter to test the voltage of your outlet. Push the black probe into one of the vertical slots on your outlet and the red probe in the other. If the voltage is 0, then the power is disconnected."

Turn the drill on and slowly push through the wall behind the outlet box. Continue pushing the drill bit through the wall until you feel it pop out through the exterior wall and through your siding. If you can't drill through the back of the outlet box, then drill the hole next to the top corner of the box so you can still easily access the wires. If the inside outlet is less than 1 foot (30 cm) from the ground, angle your drill bit up so it comes out higher on the exterior wall. Never place an exterior outlet less than 1 foot (30 cm) from the ground since it could easily be exposed to moisture.

    "GFCI outlets have a failsafe on them so they immediately stop working when they get wet.",
    "Look for a GFCI outlet that's rated for outdoor use or else it may not be safe to use.",
    "Make sure that the outlet fits inside the exterior box you attached to the wall so it's protected from the elements.",
    "You can buy GFCI outlets from your local hardware store.",
    "Strip 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) off the end of the 12/2 cable to expose the wires inside.",
    "Clamp your 12/2 stripper so it's 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) from the end of the cable.",
    "Pull the stripper toward the end of the cable to remove the outer insulation around the 3 wires inside it.",
    "Pull the wires apart to separate them so they're easier to work with.",
    "You can also slice down the middle of the 12/2 cable with a utility knife and peel back the insulation to expose the wires.",
    "Remove 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of insulation from the live and neutral wires.",
    "Grip the black wire 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the end with a pair of wire strippers.",
    "Pull the stripper toward the end of the wire to remove the insulation and expose the copper wire inside.",
    "Repeat the process with the white wire so you can attach it to the neutral screw.",
    "Remove the green insulation from the ground wire if it has it.",
    "Attach each of the wires to their corresponding screws.",
    "Wrap the end of the black wire around the black screw and the white wire on the silver screw.",
    "Attach the end of the copper ground wire to the green screw that's either on the top or bottom of the outlet.",
    "Make sure the loops go around the screws clockwise so the current can travel at full strength.",
    "Once all the wires are attached, tighten all of the screws so they have a secure connection.",
    "Your outlet may have ports on the back where you can plug the wires in rather than wrapping them around the screws.",
    "Screw the outlet into the exterior box to hold it in place.",
    "Hold the outlet inside of the exterior box so the screwholes line up with one another and so the wires are tucked in the back of the box.",
    "Use either wood screws or masonry anchors depending on whether you have wood or concrete exterior walls.",
    "Tighten the screws on the outlet to the sides of the box so it's secured in place.",
    "Some exterior boxes allow you to screw the outlets directly into them so you don't need to put more screws in your siding.",
    "Turn on the power to the outlet to test if it works.",
    "Flip the switch on your circuit box so your outlets have power again.",
    "Plug your outlet tester into the indoor and outdoor outlets to see if they're working.",
    "Check the key on top the tester to determine if the wiring for your outlets are correct.",
    "If the outlets still aren't working or the tester shows the wiring is wrong, turn off the circuit again and check the wires."
