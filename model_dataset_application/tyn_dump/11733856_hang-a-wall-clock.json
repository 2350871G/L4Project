Mark the area on your wall with a pencil.Tip: You can also find a stud without a tool by knocking on your wall. A hollow sound means that there is no stud, while a muffled sound means that there is. A stud will be much sturdier to drill into than just plain drywall. If you cannot find a stud in the area that you want to hang your clock, use piece of hardware called a screw anchor to hold your screw in place. This hardware looks like a large, hollowed-out screw, and you can find it at most hardware stores."

Take a look at the placement on the wall to see if you like where it is.
