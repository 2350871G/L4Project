          "description":"Lay the paper horizontally and put the ruler in the middle of it. Make sure to hold the ruler firmly in place with one hand. Where you place the ruler is where the score will end up. The bone folder will follow the ruler, so if it\u2019s crooked, the crease will end up that way. A 12 in (30 cm) ruler should do the trick, but if you are working with a bigger piece of paper, use an 18 in (46 cm) ruler or something larger."

          "description":"The score line creates 2 distinct sides of your paper: one with an indentation, and one with a bump. Folding into the side with the bump gives you a clean, even fold and reduces the paper\u2019s chances of cracking. Do this gently so you don't damage the paper. Here\u2019s an easy way to visualize which way to fold the paper: when you make the fold, the indented side should be facing down."

Drag the long edge of the bone folder slowly down the paper for a crisp, professional look. Like with the initial paper folding, be gentle with this part.If you need to make a large number of greeting cards to send out to people, you\u2019ll be amazed at how much time you\u2019ll save if you use a bone folder."

While you most likely won\u2019t be using the scissors to make the actual origami, it is important to have a pair on hand in case your piece of paper is too big. It\u2019s smarter to start with a bigger piece of origami paper anyway, as you can always pare it down to the size and shape you need for the final design."

If you are making a lot of origami, using a bone folder is the perfect way to ensure each fold is crisp and clean.Bone folders are especially great for big, awkward folds because they are more accurate than your hand when it comes to scoring the origami paper."

Making even folds and smoothing out surfaces is important when gluing book cloth or decorative papers to binder\u2019s board.
