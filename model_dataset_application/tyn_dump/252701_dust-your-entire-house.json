For instance, clear off anything that's gathered on your tables or countertops, and put away loose items that have collected on the floors, sofas, and chairs. To make the job more manageable, work on one room at a time. Also, once you've finished dusting a room, don't move any items back into that room until they've been dusted, as well."

          "description":"Before you start dusting, take any linens, pillows, rugs, or cushions outside and shake them thoroughly. This will knock loose a lot of the dust that's trapped on the soft surfaces, so you won't have as much to deal with inside. Try hitting your pillows and cushions against each other firmly to dislodge dust that might be embedded deep down. If it's been a long time since you dusted, it may still be a good idea to wash or vacuum these fabrics before you return them to the room."

          "description":"Before you get started dusting, put a new filter in your main air conditioning vent to trap any new dust that ends up in the air. Also, clean out or replace the filter in your vacuum cleaner, if you have one. That way, your vacuum will be able to trap more of the dust you're trying to clean. Even if you're careful to trap as much dust as possible, you'll still probably send a lot of tiny particles into the air while you're dusting, which is why changing your AC filter is important. Tip: When you combine it with regular dusting, installing an air purifier with a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter may help reduce dust in your home in the future."

Even if it doesn't look dusty, your ceiling can trap small particles that will float back down into the room, especially if the ceiling is textured. If you can't reach the ceiling with your vacuum attachment or your broom, you may need to stand on a sturdy stepstool or step ladder. Be very careful when you're climbing, and only stand on a sturdy ladder or stool. Do not climb on furniture that's not intended for standing. Warning: Do not attempt to clean your ceiling if it was manufactured before the 1980s, unless you have already had it tested to ensure it doesn't contain asbestos.Tip: Always dust a room from top to bottom. As you clean, dust will fall down onto the surfaces and floors in the room, so if you clean those areas first, they'll just get dirty again."

However, if these items are really dirty, it might be best to vacuum them before wiping them down with a cloth. Keep your cloth folded in quarters and switch to a new side whenever the side you're using gets dirty. When there are no more clean sides, grab a new cloth.

    "Wash linens and soft toys.",
    "If it's possible, wash any bedding, curtains, plush toys, slipcovers, or other fabric items that are machine washable.",
    "These soft surfaces can hold onto a lot of dust, and putting them through the wash will remove a lot of that.",
    "Vacuum your curtains with your brush attachment if you can't wash them.",
    "Tumble-dry the linens in your dryer or hang them to air dry.",
    "However, wait to replace them until you've finished dusting the rest of the room.",
    "Otherwise, they might collect more dust as you clean.",
    "Vacuum any upholstered furniture in the room.",
    "If you have any plush chairs, couches, mattresses, or other upholstered items in the room that you can't easily wash, go over the surfaces with the brush attachment on your vacuum.",
    "Be sure to especially get down into any crevices where dust can hide.",
    "Remember to remove any cushions from the furniture and vacuum underneath those, as well.",
    "Finishing the Room Move the furniture and appliances and clean underneath them.",
    "Now that you've done all this work to clean an entire room, don't leave dust bunnies lurking under your furniture.",
    "If you can, slide the furniture out of the way and vacuum or sweep underneath it.",
    "If not, use an extension arm on your vacuum and clean as far underneath each piece as you're able.",
    "It may help to have another person available if you have a lot of heavy furniture.",
    "Wipe down the baseboards.",
    "Chances are, dust will have settled along the trim at the bottom of your walls.",
    "To remove that dust, go over the baseboards with a damp microfiber cloth, working all the way around the room.",
    "If the baseboards are really dirty, spray a cloth with an all-purpose cleaner and wipe them down with that.",
    "Tip: Use a melamine foam magic eraser to easily remove any scuff marks on the baseboards.",
    "Clean carpets and rugs with a vacuum.",
    "Even if you've already shaken out the rugs, there may still be dust embedded deep in the fibers.",
    "Also, any carpets in the room will need to be vacuumed thoroughly to remove any dust that fell while you were cleaning.",
    "You can sweep your carpets and rugs if you don't have a vacuum, but this will not be as effective at removing dust.",
    "Sweep and mop hard floors.",
    "To avoid stirring dust back into the air, gently go over the floors with a broom.",
    "Then, mop the floors to pick up any dust that's been left behind.",
    "As the name suggests, a dust mop is best for this task, since there's more surface area to trap dust.",
    "However, you can use any mop that you have available.",
    "Return everything to its place.",
    "Now that you've cleaned your room from top to bottom, the only thing left to do is to put everything back in order.",
    "Move any furniture back into its place, replace your rugs, curtains, and other linens, and place small objects back onto their shelves.",
    "Continue this process for each room in your home.",
    "Then, sit back and enjoy your dust-free environment!"
