          "description":"To cut a mango, slice the flesh away from the seed in the center of the fruit. Score the 2 pieces with the most mango flesh into a grid and scoop the fruit out with a spoon. Then, carefully use a small knife to trim off the fruit surrounding the seed. You should get around 5 cups (525 g) of mango chunks. Ensure that there's no peel on any of the chunks. You may need a different number of mangoes depending on the size and variety of mangoes. For example, alphonso mangoes are smaller, so you might need a few more of them."

You can also add 3 tablespoons (36 g) of sugar if you want the mango juice to be even sweeter. Try substituting coconut milk for the water or milk if you'd like another non-dairy option. You can use your favorite sweetener, such as honey or agave, or leave out sweetener altogether if the mangoes are very sweet."

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a pitcher or measuring jug and pour the mango juice into it. The juice will drip into the pitcher, leaving the pulpy fibers in the strainer. Discard the pulp once you've finished straining the juice. If your mangoes were smooth or you don't mind thicker juice, you can skip straining it."

Consider sticking an extra sliver of mango on the side of the glass before serving the drinks and enjoy! You can cover the pitcher of mango juice and refrigerate it for up to 2 days. Unfortunately, there's nothing you can add to the juice to extend its storage time. For longer-term storage, consider freezing the juice for up to 4 months."
