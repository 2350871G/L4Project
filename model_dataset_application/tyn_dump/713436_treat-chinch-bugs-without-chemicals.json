This method also works best if you catch the infestation early and use it to target small areas of lawn. If you have hard water in your area, the soap may fail to mix in, leaving a scum on the surface after the water settles. If this happens, make a new mix using distilled or bottled water instead. Using a commercial insecticidal soap for chinch bugs is not legal in Canada, although this may just be an oversight. Homemade soap treatments are allowed. Any soap can cause damage to aquatic life.

Wear safety goggles and a dust mask to avoid irritation, and try not to create too much dust. Wash your hands after applying. Use garden-grade or food-grade DE only. Swimming pool grade DE is a more significant respiratory hazard. Non-heated DE containing less than one percent crystalline silica is the safest option. Try applying DE with a bulb applicator. This will reduce the risk of getting the dust in your eyes, nose, and mouth. Apply DE to wet grass, as well, either after it rains or you\u2019ve watered the lawn.

Too much water can backfire and make the problem worse, especially with hair chinch bug infestations (found mostly in the northern US and Canada).

    "The ideal soil pH for most turf is between 6.5 and 7.0.",
    "Test your soil with a pH kit from a garden store, and get it within this range by adding lime (to raise pH) or sulfur (to lower it).",
    "Keeping pH within this range will keep your lawn healthy and able to absorb nutrients, helping it survive pest damage.",
    "For best results, send a soil sample to a soil testing laboratory to find out the exact nutrients your soil is missing."
