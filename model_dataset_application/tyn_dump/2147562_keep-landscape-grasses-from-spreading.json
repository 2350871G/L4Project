The pot should be 12\u201d (30.5 cm) or more across and at least 8\u201d (20.3 cm) deep. Bury the pot where you want the grass. Center the grass in the pot. Use soil from the hole you dug to sink the pot to fill the pot. Use a cement drain tile, metal culvert section or plastic drain tile without perforations buried in the ground to confine the grass roots if you don\u2019t have a large plastic pot. Set pots or other items confining roots into the soil so that you leave about 1\u201d (2.5 cm) of the rim above ground. Every few years you will need to lift the container and divide the grass plant to keep it from becoming root bound or breaking the container."
