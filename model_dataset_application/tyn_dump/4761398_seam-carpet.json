For instance, placing it an area that will be underneath furniture is better than placing it in the center of your room. Hiding the seam also makes it less noticeable. Even a good seam may still be seen from time to time, so hiding it will make your room look more professional and neat."

          "description":"The two pieces of carpet should overlap by 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) when you lay them down. Each piece of carpet you seam should be at least 4 feet (1.2 m) wide. Make sure that you match the nap on the pieces of carpet being seamed together. Similarly, if the carpet has a pattern on it, that should also be matched."

          "description":"Use white chalk to mark a line along the back side of your top piece of carpet. This line should be about half the width of your overlap. In other words, the line should be 1 to 1-1/2 inches (2.5 to 3.75 cm) from the edge of the carpet, depending on how much overlap you have."

Using a straightedge, like a yardstick or meter stick, may help. Do not cut into the bottom piece while trimming the top. Ideally, you should use a special carpet knife to make this cut. In the absence of a carpet knife, a standard utility knife might work, but it will not be as easy or practical to use. Angle the cutter slightly, by about 5 degrees, to cut away a bit more backing than fiber."

Using these cuts as a guide, trim the edge of the bottom piece down completely. The guiding cuts should be 2 to 3 feet (61 to 91 cm) apart. Use a straightedge and carpet knife to trim the bottom piece. You may want to use scissors to cut from the edge of the carpet to the center of each guiding cut, however, to help you find the guiding cuts more easily when trimming the overall edge."
