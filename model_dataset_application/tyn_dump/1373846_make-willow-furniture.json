    "This will complete the bottom part of the frame and the structure should be able to stand on its own and be pretty solid.",
    "Nail 2 of the 28 in (71 cm) branches to the back of the chair.",
    "Take 1 of the branches and nail it into the two back legs, halfway up the backrest.",
    "Then take the other large branch at nail it across the top of the two uprights.",
    "There should be about 5\u20136 inches (13\u201315 cm) of overhang, so center the branches when you attach them.",
    "Lay the frame on its side and add a brace to the front and back of the frame.",
    "To solidify the frame of the chair, you\u2019ll need to add additional braces.",
    "After you lay the frame on one side, attach 1 small branch high on the inside of the front leg and 1 low on the inside of the rear leg.",
    "Be sure to nail them on the inside of the chair\u2019s frame.",
    "When you\u2019re finished, lay the frame on its opposite side and repeat the process.",
    "Form the seat by nailing 2 short branches across the top and 1 on the backrest.",
    "Stand your chair back up and attach 2 of the short branches across the top of the seat parallel to one another and evenly spaced apart.",
    "Then take 1 small branch and nail it 3\u20134 in (7.6\u201310.2 cm) up on the seat back, between the two long back supports.",
    "Make sure the nails aren\u2019t sticking too far out so they don\u2019t scratch or cut you when you sit in the chair.",
    "Strap a seat cushion to the seat of the chair to make it more comfortable.",
    "Use an outdoor seating cushion that has straps on the corners to attach it to the chair.",
    "Secure it firmly and check to see that the chair is stable by wobbling it back and forth.",
    "Sit in the chair to test its strength.",
    "If you need to add any additional supports, you can do so.",
    "Use linseed oil to create a finish and to seal the wood.",
    "Linseed oil is a great natural solution to use as a sealant to keep out moisture and prevent the wood from rotting.",
    "It also creates a nice, shiny finish on the wood.",
    "Use a cloth or brush to spread the oil evenly over the surface of the wood.",
    "You can use a spray bottle to apply to oil or apply it directly to the wood.",
    "Crafting a Small Table Cut the large diameter branches to size.",
    "For the table, you\u2019ll need 4 lengths of 18 in (46 cm), 4 of 14 in (36 cm), and 4 lengths of 12 in (30 cm) large diameter branches.",
    "Use branches that are about 1.5\u20131.75 in (3.8\u20134.4 cm) in diameter to form the frame of the table.",
    "Make sure you trim the edges of the branches to prevent them from splitting or fraying.",
    "Use a carpenter\u2019s saw to cut the thicker branches.",
    "Lay 2 of the 18 in (46 cm) branches parallel on the ground.",
    "To make your frame, start one side at a time.",
    "Lay 2 of the longer branches parallel to each other on the ground spaced out about 14 inches (36 cm) apart.",
    "Don\u2019t worry about taking actual measurements for the spacing because the branches you already cut will fit into place.",
    "Connect the branches with a 14 in (36 cm) and a 12 in (30 cm) branch.",
    "Nail a 14 in (36 cm) branch about 5 in (13 cm) from the end of the 2 larger branches by nailing through the outside of the longer branch.",
    "Then nail a 12 in (30 cm) branch about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the top of the two longer branches.",
    "Make sure you use nails long enough to penetrate through both of the branches.",
    "Then repeat the process again with the other 2 18 in (46 cm) branches.",
    "Attach the two sides together with the remaining branches.",
    "Use the 2 12 in (30 cm) branches to connect the sides at the top, nailing through the outside of the longer branches.",
    "Then connect them at the bottom using the 2 14 in (36 cm) branches to complete the frame and create a slightly wider base for the table.",
    "Wobble the frame to make sure it is stable.",
    "If it is shaky, you can add additional nails to help stabilize it.",
    "Lay small branches across the top and bottom rungs to form a table top.",
    "Depending on how you want your table to look, space the small branches out across the top of the frame using the upper rungs and do the same on the bottom rungs.",
    "Leave little to no space between the small branches for a more smooth surface, or leave gaps for a more rustic look.Tip: Use pruning shears to trim the branches to size.",
    "Glue or nail the branches across the top and bottom rungs.",
    "With your smaller willow twigs and branches laid side by side to form a table top, either glue or nail them into place.",
    "If you nail them, be sure to use small nails that won\u2019t poke through the bottom of the rung.",
    "Make sure the branches are firmly secured before you use your table.",
    "Apply linseed oil to finish and seal the wood.",
    "Use a rag or a brush to apply linseed oil all over the willow table to prevent the wood from rotting and to create a finish that will look nice.",
    "You can use a spray bottle or apply the oil directly to the wood.",
    "Just be sure to apply an even coating over the entire surface."
