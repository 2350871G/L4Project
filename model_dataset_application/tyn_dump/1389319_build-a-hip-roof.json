Once you've made these measurements, multiply the length of each of the 4 sides by its height to find the area. Add the areas of all the sides together to calculate the total area of the roof. To find how many plywood sheets you'll need, measure a sheet of sheathing and multiply its length by its height to find the area. Finally, divide the area of the whole roof by the area of one plywood sheet to figure out the number of sheets you\u2019ll need. For example, say that 2 of the sides of your hip roof measure 6 feet (1.8 m), 2 sides measure 10 feet (3.0 m), and the roof is 3 feet (0.91 m) high. The total length is then 32 feet (9.8 m), and the total area of the roof is 96 square feet (8.9 m). Then, if the plywood sheets are each 20 square feet (1.9 m), divide 96 by 20 to calculate that you\u2019ll need 4.8 sheets of plywood.

Assembling the King and Hip Rafters Attach 4-6 centering rafters and lift the ridge beam into place. The first step in the process of erecting the hip roof is to get the ridge beam into place at the top of the roof. Place the 4-6 common rafters in their designated positions along the 2 longest walls, and nail them firmly to the wall with a nail gun. Then, lift the ridge beam to the correct height.

Attach the 6 king common rafters at the end of the ridge board. King common rafters keep the ridge board steady in place. Nail one rafter on each side of the hip roof to brace the ridge board in place. Then, nail the king rafters in place against the ridge board. King common rafters are the common rafters closest to the hip rafters. There are 6 of these rafters on every hip roof. King common rafters are structurally identical to the other common rafters.

When you attach the hip rafters, nail them in place at the bottom first before nailing the top against the ridge beam. As you attach the hip rafters, attach a ceiling joist next to each one for extra support. Hip rafters are the 4 long, diagonal rafters that attach to the ends of the ridge beam and to the corners of the structure. Nail the rest of the common rafters to the ridge beam. Measure carefully so that each common rafter is spaced exactly 20 inches (51 cm) from the adjacent common rafters. The common rafters and ridge beam should now stand solidly on their own. Most hip roofs only have 1 common rafter on the side of the roof built off of the short walls. Finishing the Hip Roof Nail the jack rafters to the hip rafters and secure them to the walls. Depending on the size of the roof, most hip roofs will have 4-6 short jack rafters that are spaced out every 20 inches (51 cm) between the hip rafters and the king common rafters. Measure the distance between the angled hip rafter and the top of the wall at 20 in (51 cm) increments and cut jack rafters to fit. Then use your nail gun to attach the jack rafters to the hip rafter and wall. Jack rafters run from the top of the structure\u2019s wall to the angled hip rafter, parallel to the common rafters. Determine the number of plywood sheets you\u2019ll need. Begin by measuring the width and height of each of the 4 sides of the roof. Once you've made these measurements, multiply the length of each of the 4 sides by its height to find the area. Add the areas of all the sides together to calculate the total area of the roof.

For example, say that 2 of the sides of your hip roof measure 6 feet (1.8 m), 2 sides measure 10 feet (3.0 m), and the roof is 3 feet (0.91 m) high. The total length is then 32 feet (9.8 m), and the total area of the roof is 96 square feet (8.9 m). Then, if the plywood sheets are each 20 square feet (1.9 m), divide 96 by 20 to calculate that you\u2019ll need 4.8 sheets of plywood. If the final calculation doesn't result in a whole number, round up to the nearest whole number. In our example, you\u2019d need to purchase 5 sheets. Nail the plywood sheathing to the rafters.
