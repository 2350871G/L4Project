One thing that you can do to ensure that all players have a chance at winning is to make rule adjustments to suit the needs of younger players. Try teaming up younger players with an adult or older child player to help even the playing field.

That means cell phones, TVs, tablets, or anything else that might distract players from the game should be shut off and out of sight. If you have trouble getting your family members to observe this rule, try setting a consequence. For example, you might say that anyone caught using a device during family game night has to wear a silly hat for the rest of the evening. If that doesn\u2019t work, try a more serious consequence like losing a turn or getting a points deducted. Just make sure that you make the consequence clear before you start the game night."
