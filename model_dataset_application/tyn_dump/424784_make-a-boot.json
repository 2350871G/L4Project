      "headline":"Make the lace holes.",
      "description":"Given that lace holes are an inch apart, multiply the number of lace holes on ONE SIDE of your boot times 10 to determine how much lacing you will need. If you make 10 lace holes each an inch apart, you need 90 to 100 inches (228.6 to 254.0 cm) of lacing to tie your boots. And that's just for the front of one boot! The back should take a bit less, since there's no slope, so let's say 8 holes x 9 = 72\". For two boots, you'll need about 344\" (~29 ft.) of rawhide laces to make these work! Fortunately, rawhide is cheap and comes commonly in 10 meter (~33 ft) spools. You can cut down on the rawhide consumption by using a straight-up lace and knot (instead of the criss-cross) for the back of the boot, or making your lace holes farther apart. You may also need more or less depending on how much gap you leave between the side flaps, the height of the boot, etc. Beware of compromising here though -- laces set further apart mean less stability, looser seams, and gaps in material (through which bugs/dirt may enter) etc."
