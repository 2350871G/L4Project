The length of the lace should be eight times greater than the diameter of the hoop you are using. For example, if you are using a 5-inch (13 cm) hoop, then 2 yards (1.8 meters) of lace should be enough. If you do not want to use suede lace, then you can also use ribbon."

The length of the string should be ten times the diameter of the hoop. Traditionally, natural-colored string is used, but you can use any color you want.

You should place glue on at least four, evenly spaced spots on the hoop. Make sure to use the small binder clips to hold the lace in place where the glue is.

You can use feathers, strips of fabric, beads, gemstones, and shells to decorate your dreamcatcher. Choose materials that have personal meaning for you. Wrapping the Hoop Place a half-inch (1.3 cm) line of glue on the top of the hoop. Holding the end of the suede lace against the hoop, wrap it around the line of glue. When you are wrapping the suede lace, make sure there are no spaces between the pieces of lace.

Place the hoop aside for 15 to 20 minutes to let the glue finish drying. After 15 minutes, take off the clips. Cut off any extra pieces of lace or ribbon. Weaving the Web Tie the string securely to the top of the circle. Cut 2 yards (1.8 meters) of string. Start by tying a knot at the top of the hoop. Tie a double or triple knot to ensure that the string is secure. Loop the string around the hoop. Working clockwise, stretch the string to a spot about 2 inches (5 cm) over on the hoop.

Loop the string around the midpoint of the first line of thread. Using the same technique, loop it around the string and over itself to create a hitch. Continue weaving the thread this way until you reach the top of the hoop. Continue the weaving until a small circle forms in the middle. As you weave the web, the circle in the middle will get smaller and smaller. Weave the string until only a small circle is left in the middle of the dreamcatcher. Make sure to pull the string tight to secure the web. Secure the web with a knot. Once the circle is small, about the size of a penny or dime, tie a knot around the next string instead of hitching it. Tie a double or triple knot to make sure the string is secure and will not come undone. Then trim off any extra string with scissors. Make a hanging loop. Cut a 5-inch (13 cm) piece of suede lace. Tie the loose ends into a knot to make a circle. Secure the lace around the top of the hoop by pushing the knot through the loop. Then pull tight to create the hanging loop. Decorating Your Dreamcatcher Loop beads into the web. You will need to do this as you make the web. Place a bead on the string before you loop and hitch it to the next string. You can either space them out randomly, or create a pattern by placing a bead on every other string. Hang strips of fabric. Purchase different colors or patterns of fabric. Cut the fabric into strips. Fold the strips in half to create a loop. Place the loop underneath the bottom rim of the dreamcatcher. Thread the ends of the fabric through the loop and pull tight to secure it. You can also do this technique with suede lace, strips of leather, or any other type of string to create a dreamy hanging effect. Thread beads onto the strips. Thread a bead onto your strip of fabric or string. Position the bead to where you want it on the string. Tie a small knot underneath the bead. The knot will hold the bead in place. Hang feathers. Group four to five feathers together. Use a small binder clip to hold them together while you tie and knot a string around the tops of the feathers to secure them. Then tie and knot the string along the bottom of the dream catcher. You can also thread various beads onto the strings as well before you attach them to the dreamcatcher.",
