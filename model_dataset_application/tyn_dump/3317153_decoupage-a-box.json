You can also upcycle old boxes, such as shoe boxes or small cardboard shipping boxes. You can even use cereal boxes or other food boxes! You can also d\u00e9coupage old trunks.

If you bought a wooden box, you may need to unscrew the hinges and put them to the side to take the lid off completely. Make sure to put the metal parts in a safe place."

          "description":"If you have a wood box with rough edges, sandpaper can quickly take care of that problem. Run the sandpaper back and forth over the rough areas until the whole surface is smooth. Brush the dust off with a cloth when you're done. Aim for a sandpaper in the 160-220 grit range."

Paint the gesso on in a single, even layer, trying to go the same direction along each side. Once it's dry, add a layer of acrylic paint the same way if you'd like. A primer can make it easier for your paper to stick, particularly with wood or slick boxes (such as cereal boxes) but it's not strictly necessary. However, if you plan to leave some areas blank when you add your paper decorations, you may want to paint the box a color of your choosing. In that case, you should prime it first. You may need to sand the box again to smooth out the surface for the paper."

Because the paper is so thin, you won't see the edges as much as you would with other paper. You can also use colorful tissue paper meant for stuffing in packages. Because napkins are so thin, you can often leave a border around the edge, and it will disappear or look feathery when you apply the glue. It becomes translucent."

You can find images or just use the text to create a book-centered box. Always test out the paper first because it can be difficult to glue down some glossy paper.
