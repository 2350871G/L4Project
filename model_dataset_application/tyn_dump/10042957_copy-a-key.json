Once the key is charred on one side, set it down until it is cool to the touch. Use a pair of pliers to hold the key so you don\u2019t burn your fingers."

Press the tape firmly onto the blackened side of the key so the char transfers. The outline of the key will transfer to the sticky side of the tape. Leave a fingertip-sized bit of tape at the end of the key so it\u2019s easier to remove."

Make sure the tape lays flat so the shape of the teeth is not distorted. Be sure to place the tape away from any raised letters or numbers on the card otherwise it will be too thick to fit in the lock. Use a light-colored card so you can easily see the imprint of the key."

If the teeth are not close to the correct size, they will not be able to turn the lock. It doesn\u2019t matter how the large end of the key is shaped. As long as the teeth are cut correctly, the key should work. Hold the original key up to the one you\u2019re cutting out to compare the teeth."
