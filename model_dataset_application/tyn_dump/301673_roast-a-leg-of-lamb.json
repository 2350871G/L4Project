That's because the quality of the meat will have a big impact on the taste of the finished roast. Ask for a leg of lamb at market weight, meaning it was butchered at the proper age. Lamb that's below market weight was butchered too early. Butchering a baby lamb is unethical and isn't a common practice among reputable farmers and butchers. Lamb that's over market weight was butchered later in the animal's life. Older meat will taste more like mutton (the meat of an adult sheep) than lamb.

Boneless meat usually comes in an oven-safe net or wrapped in twine, to keep the meat in the shape of a leg. With the bone, a leg of lamb will weight about 6 1/2 to 8 pounds. If your boneless leg of lamb does not come in an oven-safe net, use kitchen twine to tie the meat together in several spots along its length."
