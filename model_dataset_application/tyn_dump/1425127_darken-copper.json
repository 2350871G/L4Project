If you have safety goggles, wear them. If liver of sulfur gets on your skin remove clothing to expose the affected area and rinse in running water for fifteen minutes. If this substance gets on your eyes, rinse in running water for fifteen minutes, occasionally moving your lower and upper eyelids apart to expose more of your eye to the water.

Mix this pea sized nugget with approximately 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Gel or liquid solution should be diluted according to the instructions, as different brands may contain different concentrations of liver of sulfur or already be pre-diluted to the correct strength. Cold water and more dilute solutions should work fine when treating copper, and allow more control over the exact color.

Depending on the concentration of the solution, and the temperature of your copper, you may see any color from pink to black. Dipping it into the solution additional times should produce darker colors, ending in a black or grey patina. If the color changes are minor, try heating the copper in a pan of hot, but not boiling, water. Higher temperature should produce a more dramatic color change. If the color is not dark enough, try mixing in 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) pure ammonia into the solution. Adding additional ammonia may result in a reddish color, rather than black."

If the color change has progressed too far, or if you would like to create a more uneven, antique look, gently scrub the patina with steel wool or a paste made from baking soda and a few drops of water.
