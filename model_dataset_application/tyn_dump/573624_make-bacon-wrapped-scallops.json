For crispier bacon, partially cook the bacon before wrapping the scallops. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Cover a baking sheet in parchment paper and lay the strips of bacon out on the paper. Cook the bacon for 12-15 minutes until it starts to become golden brown. Don't cook it so long that it begins to get crisp and lose its flexibility."

This will keep the bacon wrapped around the scallop and secured to it so it won\u2019t come apart or slip off. You can also cook up to 5 scallops on one skewer. In this case, use the skewer to secure the bacon to the scallops by pushing the point through the overlapped bacon, into the scallop and out through the other side of the wrapped scallop. Push the scallop down from the pointed end toward the handle of the skewer and repeat the process, stacking the scallops until the skewer is full."

Look for a uniform shape, as opposed to scallops that look shredded and destroyed  These are signs that they have been mishandled. Most are wet-packed, but dry-packed and diver-caught scallops are higher quality. Any of these will work. Avoid using frozen scallops for this recipe. Rinse the scallops.

The muscle is a rectangular tab attached to the body of the scallop. The muscle is tougher than the rest of the scallop, making it less desirable to eat.
