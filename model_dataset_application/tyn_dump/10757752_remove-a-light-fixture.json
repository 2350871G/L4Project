Never work on a light fixture if the power is on. If you cannot find the switch for the individual circuit that you will be working on, either turn off the power for the entire home or contact an electrician to remove the light fixture for you.

For Hollywood lights and chandeliers, use a screwdriver or a drill to remove the screws on the base of the fixture. For lights with bolts, unscrew each bolt while supporting the cover to lift it down from the ceiling. Always support the fixture cover during the process. Lift it away from the fixture plate once it is loose to stop it falling. Get another person to help you hold the fixture if it's heavy. Some light fixtures require you to twist the cover to remove it from the fixture plate. Try this method if simply unscrewing the knob or screws doesn't work. Sometimes light covers can stick to the ceiling due to paint. Use a flat screwdriver to carefully pry the light shade free from the ceiling, just as you would open the lid of a paint can. Move your head so that it\u2019s not directly underneath the light cover as you remove it, as sometimes dust or dead bugs may fall out."
