          "description":"Think about mixing fruits with sharp, juicy flavors along with mildly-flavored fruits. The tangy flavor of pineapple is a great match for more softly-flavored fruits like cantaloupes and grapes. Establish a color scheme for your bouquet before you start. For instance, if you want your bouquet to look like a sunset, consider using a combination of strawberries, cantaloupe, watermelon, and pineapple."

          "headline":"Cut your larger fruit into small, decorative pieces.",
          "description":"Use a sharp knife to slice the larger portions of fruit into bite-sized pieces. While small fruits like strawberries won\u2019t require too much prep, fruits like pineapple, cantaloupe, and watermelon will need to be sliced into smaller portions. To add some creative flair to your bouquet, use a cookie cutter to slice your fruit into fun shapes. Use a flower-shaped cookie cutter to make your pineapple slices look like flower blossoms. These slices may end up being a little larger than bite-sized."

The floral foam pieces should reach three-quarters of the height of the vase or container that you\u2019re using to hold the fruit. Consider cutting angular pieces of floral foam to tuck in with the larger cubes to provide a more secure base for the fruit.

Even though skewers will be holding the fruit in place, the foil will prevent any foam from touching the lower levels of fruit in the bouquet. Be sure to tuck in the foil around the edges of the floral foam with your fingers. This will keep the foil in place."

If you\u2019re having trouble finding a certain herb or flower in a grocery store or flower shop, consider checking online. If you\u2019ve picked the herbs and flowers yourself, trim off the ends of the stems for a nicer presentation. You only need to have about 6 inches (15 cm) to 8 inches (20 cm) of stalk total. Lay the herbs on a flat surface to organize them. Set all of your herbs and edible flowers on a table or other flat surface to make sure that you have everything you need.

This will help to keep the arrangement secure as you add more plants to it with your dominant hand. To make your bouquet more visually appealing, try pairing tall and short plants together, like lavender and mint. Use a variety of colors to make your bouquet as vibrant as possible. For example, pair a white echinacea flower with green and earth-toned herbs like rosemary and thyme. Combine sage, lavender, and mint for a great smelling bouquet. Carrot blossoms and fennel sprigs also work well together in a bouquet."
