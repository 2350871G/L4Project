Look for a closet in a clean, dark place that can be converted to a pantry. Make sure it does not share a wall with a laundry room or a room that holds a lot of computers or electronics. That might contribute to overheating your pantry and spoiling your food."

      "description":"Avoid an inward door because that will take up too much space in your pantry and make it hard for you to get to anything you store behind the door.

You will need to be able to see everything in your pantry, especially if it is deep. Install a light that can be turned on by a switch or a string that hangs from the overhead light."

      "description":"Shelving will be very important in transforming a closet into a pantry. Measure the height, width and depth of the pantry to estimate how many shelves you will need. Look for thick, solid shelves that will make organization easy and efficient. Remember that you will have cans and boxes of differing sizes. You might want to vary the amount of space between shelves. Some pantries also use wire shelving. Consider ease of access. While deep pantry shelves may allow you to store more canned goods, having to reach all the way back into the deepest part of the pantry might be difficult."
