This means that your left and right speakers should be the same distance from each other as they are from your couch.Left and right stereo speakers should be tilted inwards, facing the middle of your couch.

Therefore, it\u2019s important to know the approximate weight of your speakers before buying the mounts. Most mounts are rated in 5 lb (2.3 kg) increments, so you can estimate the weight if needed. If you\u2019re unsure, use your bathroom scale to help determine the weight.Purchase mounts that are rated to hold the weight of your speakers or heavier speakers.
