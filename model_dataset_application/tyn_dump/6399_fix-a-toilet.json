If you can see the clog come up, you can try to flush the water down without turning the water back on. There should be enough water in the bowl to flush it.

If you find build-up from the water or other gunk, scour it off with a kitchen pad or a pocketknife and see if you can get the flapper to create a good seal.

    "Look for a locknut assembly at the bottom of the tank on the inside and on the outside of the tank.",
    "This should be what's keeping the assembly in the tank.",
    "You'll need to unscrew it from both sides with an adjustable wrench and lift the assembly free.",
    "At this point, you should tighten the arms of the ballcock assembly, testing to make sure the arm functions and nothing seems to be broken, missing, or misaligned.",
    "If you don't see anything wrong but the toilet is still running and none of the other maintenance options have helped, you'll just need to replace the assembly with a new one.",
    "Typically, they'll cost anywhere between $10-$30.",
    "Screw the new ballcock assembly in place.",
    "Follow the reverse of the steps you followed in removing the assembly, screwing it in tightly and re-affixing the floating arm (though, it'll probably come with a new float arm and possibly a new flapper).",
    "Turn the water back on and let the toilet run for a few minutes before attempting to flush it.",
    "Fixing a Weak Flush Check the water level in the tank.",
    "If there isn't enough water coming into the bowl to thoroughly clean it out, it probably means that not enough water is getting into the tank in the first place.",
    "Find the floating arm and try bending it up slightly to allow more water to fill into the tank.",
    "Be careful not to raise it too far past the overflow tube, or the tank will run constantly.",
    "Check the flush valve at the bottom of the tank.",
    "After shutting off the water and flushing the tank, check to make sure the valve isn't closing too soon, shutting off more water from getting into the bowl.",
    "If it is, adjust the rod arm or the chain.",
    "There should be three or four different height settings to allow the assembly to customize to your toilet.",
    "Try different settings until enough water flows into the toilet.",
    "Check the water ports on the underside of the toilet bowl rim.",
    "These will often become clogged with mildew or rust because it's a difficult area of the toilet to clean.",
    "Take a toilet brush with toilet cleaner to the underside of the rim to make sure enough water can get through the ports.",
    "To see if they're clogged without sticking your head in the toilet, use a small mirror and check them out in the reflection.",
    "You can also use a wire hanger to clean the ports out if there's anything lodged in there you can't get out with a brush.",
    "Check to see if the joint that connects the tank to the toilet bowl is leaking.",
    "Generally, a pipe connects them.",
    "Look at the base of the tank and check the nuts to see if they need tightening, replacing, or new washers.",
    "If part of the tank or bowl is cracked or leaking, this may result in a weak flush or other problems and you may need to replace the toilet completely.",
    "Replacing the Seat Remove the old seat.",
    "One of the most common and easily fixable issues with a toilet is a broken or otherwise malfunctioning seat that needs replacing.",
    "First, you'll need to remove the old seat and dispose of it by removing the nut from the mounting bolts under the rim of the toilet and pulling the seat and lid off.",
    "Look under the lip of the toilet rim where the seat and lid connect to the bowl.",
    "You should see the nut and washer holding the seat on.",
    "Unscrew it with an adjustable crescent wrench and remove the washer and nut.",
    "The bolts should easily slide free from the top and you can remove the seat.",
    "If the nut is stuck or rusty, spray some WD-40 on it to help it come loose.",
    "Be careful not to struggle with the wrench too much and risk cracking the bowl of the toilet with your wrench or smacking your hand on something.",
    "Get a new seat.",
    "Typically, most toilets are manufactured in two sizes, so make sure you've got the right size to match your particular toilet.",
    "Measure the width and length of bowl from the mounting bolt to the lip and take your measurements to the hardware or housewares store to make sure you've got the right size for your toilet.",
    "While you're at the hardware store, you'll probably want to buy replacement washers, nuts, and bolts unless the seat comes with them.",
    "Make sure they fit your toilet.",
    "Take in the old ones to have on hand for comparison.",
    "Install the new seat.",
    "Fix the bolts through the holes in the toilet rim and screw the nut onto the bowl.",
    "Be careful not to use too much force when tightening, but make sure the seat is secure."
