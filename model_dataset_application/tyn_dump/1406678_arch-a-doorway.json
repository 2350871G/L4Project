Then, check the width of the opening at the top of the frame since that\u2019s where you\u2019ll install your arch. Aim to have the top of the arch extend about 4 inches (10 cm) down from the frame so people can comfortably walk through it. Avoid extending the arch down too far in your doorway since taller people may not be able to fit through it comfortably. Try to keep the top of your arch about 78\u201380 inches (200\u2013200 cm) from the floor. If you\u2019re adding an arch to an existing door, remove the trim with a pry bar and take off the drywall around it to expose the frame."

Use your measuring tape to mark 4 inches (10 cm) in from the short side of the plywood sheet. Then make another mark 10 inches (25 cm) down from the first one for the bottom corner of your arch. Snap a chalk line across the plywood so you have 2 parallel lines. You can buy chalk lines from hardware or home improvement stores. If you don\u2019t have a chalk line, you can also use a pencil and a straightedge to draw your lines. If you don\u2019t want to draw or cut your own arches, you can buy a prefabricated kit that provides the pieces you need for your archway. Search for a kit that\u2019s adjustable or matches the width of your doorway.Tip: Ask the employees to cut your plywood to the right size for you if you don\u2019t want to cut it at home."

Slide the end of the tape measure over the nail and make sure it doesn\u2019t slip off easily. Tape measures have holes in the end so you can easily attach them to a nail. If your tape measure doesn\u2019t have a hole in the end, then you can wrap a string around the nail instead."

Hold a pencil on the mark next to your tape measure, and move it toward the side of the plywood. Since the tape measure is locked in place, it will draw a curve that stops at the end of the bottom line. Move the tape measure to the other side to finish the other side of the arch. Be gentle with the tape measure since it may still extend slightly if you pull on it hard enough. If you\u2019re using a string instead of a tape measure, tie it to your pencil."

    "Line the curved edge of the archway with 2 \u20442 in (6.4 cm) thick wood pieces and nail them in from each side.",
    "Leave about 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) between each of your spacers so it\u2019s the same thickness as the doorway.",
    "Cut down scrap pieces of 2 in \u00d7 4 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 10.2 cm) boards for your spacers so you don\u2019t need to buy additional wood.",
    "Screw 2 \u20442 in (6.4 cm) boards onto the corners of your door frame.",
    "Hold a board that\u2019s the same width as your doorway at the top of the door frame so there\u2019s \u20442 in (1.3 cm) of space on either side of it.",
    "Drive screws into the middle of the board every 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) to secure it in place.",
    "Then screw 2 vertical boards that are each 10 inches (25 cm) long on the sides of the frame so the short edges are flush with the top board.",
    "These boards allow you to easily attach the plywood to the door frame so your archway is flush with the rest of your wall.",
    "Slide the archway you built over the board on the frame and nail it in place.",
    "Carefully guide the archway you built over the 2 \u20442 in (6.4 cm) boards so the plywood is flush with the door frame.",
    "Once your archway is at the correct height, have a helper hold it in place while you drive 3 in (7.6 cm) nails through the plywood into the boards every 4 inches (10 cm).",
    "If you don\u2019t have a helper, use a nail gun to secure the arch in place.",
    "Be sure to wear safety glasses when using a nail gun.",
    "Adding Drywall Nail drywall pieces onto the archway.",
    "Cut out 2 pieces of drywall that are 14 inches (36 cm) tall and the same width as your door frame using a utility knife.",
    "Make sure the new pieces match the thickness of your existing drywall.",
    "Hold one of the pieces against the archway so the top edges are flush with one another and nail it in place every 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm).",
    "Work on one side of the archway at a time so it\u2019s easier to handle and maneuver.",
    "You can buy sheets of drywall from a home improvement or hardware store.",
    "Wear safety glasses when you install drywall since the dust could get in your eyes.",
    "Remove any excess drywall off with a flush-cut saw.",
    "A flush-cut saw has a straight, flexible blade so you can cut your drywall so it\u2019s flush with the plywood.",
    "Start at the bottom corner of the arch and saw along the curve of the archway.",
    "Once you saw through the drywall on one side of the door frame, attach the other side and saw through it as well.",
    "You can buy a flush-cut saw from your local hardware store.",
    "You can also use a reciprocating saw to cut through the drywall faster if you want.",
    "Bend drywall strips to cover the bottom of the arch.",
    "Cut 2 strips of drywall so they\u2019re the same width as the door frame and half the length of the arch.",
    "Hold the strip against the bottom of the archway and lightly push on it so it bends along the curve.",
    "Screw the strip of drywall every 2 inches (5.1 cm) along the edges of the plywood using screws that are 2 inches (5.1 cm) long.",
    "Repeat the process with the second strip of drywall on the other side of the frame.",
    "If the drywall doesn\u2019t sit flush against the bottom of the arch, drive additional screws into the spacers in the middle of the archway.Tip: Wet the back of the drywall with a sponge to make it easier to bend along the curve.",
    "Apply drywall mud to your archway.",
    "Buy a container of premixed drywall mud and stir it together with a flat trowel.",
    "Scoop out some of the drywall mud and spread it evenly over any seams between drywall pieces to help hold them together.",
    "Push the drywall mud in between the seams with your trowel, and remove any excess so your wall is flat.",
    "You can buy drywall mud from your local home improvement store.",
    "Hold edges together with fiberglass netting and let the mud dry.",
    "While the first layer of mud is still wet, push a layer of fiberglass netting over the seams on the bottom of the arch.",
    "If the fiberglass netting bunches up rather than lying flat, then use a pair of scissors to cut halfway through the netting every 2 inches (5.1 cm).",
    "Press the netting into the wet mud and let it set for about 24 hours.",
    "You can buy fiberglass netting from a local hardware store.",
    "If you can\u2019t find any fiberglass netting, paper tape works as well.",
    "Put on a second layer of drywall mud and let it dry.",
    "Once the first layer of drywall mud is dry, use your flat trowel to apply a second layer to the archway.",
    "Cover the fiberglass netting completely to hide it and seal the seam between drywall pieces.",
    "Compact the drywall mud as much as you can before smoothing it out and removing the excess.",
    "Let the second layer of mud set completely for at least 24 hours.",
    "Once you\u2019ve finished applying drywall, you can paint the wall."
