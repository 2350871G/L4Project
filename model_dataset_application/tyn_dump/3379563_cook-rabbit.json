          "description":"Place the rabbit pieces into the marinade and toss well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour, if not longer. When roasting an entire rabbit, only use farmed rabbit. If using wild rabbit, only use the saddle or torso of the rabbit. Farmed rabbit has much more fat, so it fares better in dry heat methods like roasting than wild rabbit does. Since the saddle of wild rabbit is fatty enough, though, it can still be roasted. Use 2 large saddles or 4 smaller saddles from wild rabbits in place of 2 full farmed rabbits. Marinating the rabbit for 2 hours is actually ideal since the marinade will have more time to permeate and flavor the meat."

    "If you need to fry the rabbit pieces in batches, let them drain in the colander as they wait.",
    "Only flour the rabbit pieces immediately before you intend to fry them.",
    "Drain and serve.",
    "Transfer the rabbit pieces to layers of clean paper towels or brown paper bags.",
    "Let drain for a few minutes before serving, and serve the pieces hot or at room temperature.",
    "Slow-Cooked Rabbit Place the first nine ingredients in a slow cooker.",
    "Layer the rabbit pieces, celery, carrots, onion, water chestnuts, and mushroom inside the slow cooker.",
    "Pour the chicken broth over the contents of the slow cooker and sprinkle with salt and pepper as desired.",
    "If you are not sure about how much salt and pepper to go with, try 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of pepper.",
    "Cook on low for 6 hours.",
    "Cover the slow cooker and let the rabbit cook until it becomes tender enough to fall apart when cut into with a fork.",
    "The cover must stay on throughout the entire 6 hours.",
    "If you remove the cover, you will allow some of the heat that has built up inside to escape.",
    "This heat is an essential element involved in cooking the contents of the slow cooker, though, so letting any at all escape can affect the cooking time.",
    "Combine the sherry and cornstarch.",
    "Vigorously whisk the two ingredients together in a small dish until well combined into a slurry.",
    "Thicken the sauce.",
    "Remove the rabbit from the slow cooker and stir the corn starch slurry into the remaining sauce.",
    "Cover and cook on high for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.",
    "Alternatively, you could pour the sauce into a medium saucepan and add the cornstarch slurry to it that way.",
    "Heat the contents of the saucepan on medium-high until they reach a boil.",
    "Let boil for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.",
    "Keep the cooked rabbit pieces warm as you thicken the sauce.",
    "Mix the rabbit back into the slow cooker.",
    "Add the rabbit back to the sauce in the slow cooker and mix gently to coat.",
    "The purpose behind this step is to coat the rabbit in the final sauce while also reheating it through.",
    "Serve.",
    "Transfer the rabbit pieces to individual serving dishes.",
    "Ladle the sauce over the rabbit before serving.",
    "Coniglio Fettuccine Alfredo Prepare noodles according to package instructions.",
    "Season rabbit, if desired, with salt and pepper.",
    "Melt 3 Tbsp.",
    "butter in a 12 inch (30.5 cm) skillet over medium-high heat and cook rabbit, stirring occasionally, until rabbit is thoroughly cooked.",
    "Remove rabbit from pan and set aside.",
    "Add tomatoes and broccoli into the same skillet, reduce to medium heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender.",
    "Add cooked rabbit back to skillet and keep warm.",
    "Melt \u00bc cup of butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat.",
    "Add the cream, reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring constantly; then add the garlic and cheese and whisk quickly, heating through.",
    "Add sauce to meat in skillet and serve over hot fettuccine noodles.",
    "Finished."
