However, there is a good way to kill Raam if you forgot to get the bow and sniper rifle: Get behind a concrete block shoot at Raam until he gets to you, then throw a grenade behind him a knock off the kryll. Don't try to impale him with the lancer. It doesn't work. The troika is very effective, however it is unprotected and nigh impossible to reach."
