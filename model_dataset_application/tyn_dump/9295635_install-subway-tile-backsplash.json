In spaces where a whole tile won\u2019t fit, you\u2019ll have to cut smaller pieces of whole tile. Use a wet saw to cut your tiles. If you don\u2019t have a wet saw, you can purchase a ceramic tile cutter. Before cutting a tile, use a pencil to outline where you need to cut it. Grouting and Caulking Allow the tiles to set overnight. Before grouting, caulking, and finishing your job, wait at least 12 hours for the mastic to dry and the tiles to set. If you don\u2019t, you could wind up displacing your tiles. Remove spacers from between your subway tiles. Move over your tiles from the left to the right and remove all of the spacers you placed to separate the tiles from one another. If you don\u2019t remove the spacers before applying grout, you\u2019ll have problems with your grout in the future. If the spacer won't come out, use a flathead screwdriver to pry it out. Be careful not to damage the tile. Open your premixed grout 15 minutes before you use it. While you can mix your own grout, it is much easier to purchase premixed grout and apply it without preparation. However, make sure you don\u2019t open the grout until you\u2019re ready to use it. If you open it earlier, it may begin to dry before you use it. Spread grout with a float back and forth. Scoop up a generous amount of grout from your bucket with your float.
