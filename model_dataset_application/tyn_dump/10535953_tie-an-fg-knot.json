If your main line isn't already rigged to your fishing pole, tie one end of it to something sturdy so that you can keep tension as you tie the knot. Wrap the other end of the main line around your hand 5-6 times so that you can keep it taut as you tie the knot. If your pole is already rigged with the main line, lean the rod against a wall to create tension. If you want to have both hands available to tie the knot, you can place the end of the main line in your mouth or step on the other end with your foot."

Use one hand to hold the leader straight so that it\u2019s at a 90-degree angle with the main line. Wrap the lead line under and around the main line, on the side closest to where the pole would be. Pull the end of the leader to form the first coil in the FG knot. Leave at least 4\u20135 inches (10\u201313 cm) of excess line at the end of the leader so that you can wrap it multiple times. The leader is typically made of fluorocarbon and is more translucent than your main line."

Pull the end of the leader after every wrap to keep the knot tight. Securing the Knot and Trimming Excess Line Make 2 looped knots at the end of the FG knot. Pinch the lines at the end of the FG knot with your fingertips so that it doesn\u2019t unravel as you finish securing it. Loop the lead line around both the leader and main line, then pull the end of the leader through the loop you created to make a tight knot at the end of the FG knot.

The main line should be kept tight as you tie the hitch knots. Cut off the end of the leader. Use scissors or a knife to cut off the excess line after the knot on the lead line. Cut the line as close as you can to the hitch knot to reduce the likelihood of the knot coming undone. Do not cut the coils of the knot as you do this. Tie 2 more hitch knots at the end the main line. Loop the main line around itself and then pull the end of the line through the loop you created to tie another hitch knot at the end of the FG knot. Repeat the process so that there are 2 hitch knots at the end. This will prevent the loops on the rod from catching on the end of the knot. Cut the excess main line.
