Grab this panel by its side and gently slide it out to access the pod receptacle. If it\u2019s full of used pods, dump them in the trash or set them aside for recycling. If it isn\u2019t full, you don\u2019t need to empty it. Slide the panel back into the machine. The size of the receptacle is different depending on the model. The Nespresso pods are pretty small, so most machines can hold at least 10-15 pods. Empty the machine out every week to ensure that the receptacle doesn\u2019t fill up and jam. When your machine is done brewing a cup of coffee or espresso, the pod automatically drops into the receptacle the next time you open the machine. If you can\u2019t open the machine to put a pod in, it\u2019s probably because the receptacle is full. If it\u2019s jammed, you may need to use a bit of force to pull the receptacle out. This happens when the used pods overflow and block the front panel from opening."
