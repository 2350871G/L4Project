Make note of any such openings that need filling. Some wood types with an open grain structure, like mahogany or oak, are especially susceptible to these openings."

          "description":"After tapping the nails down and locating any holes or openings, you need to fill them. With a grain filler from a hardware store, you can fill these holes easily. Scoop some of the filler onto a putty knife and press the filler into the hole. Then use the edge of the knife to scrape away any excess filler. Grain fillers come in several colors. Try to match the color of the grain filler you purchase to your wood as closely as possible. You can also mix some sawdust from your wood with the grain filler to match the color more exactly."

          "description":"Wait several hours or overnight for the grain filler to dry. Then, take a piece of 200-grit sandpaper and sand down the excess filler until it's smooth and even with the wood's surface. Sandpaper ranges in grit levels from 40 to 600, which refers to the size of the pebbles on the paper. The lower the grit, the larger the stones. Lower grits are used for heavy-duty sanding jobs, while higher ones are for finer sanding."

Sand in a straight line, back and forth, until you reach the end of the wood's surface. Repeat this process for every part of the wood you'll be staining. You'll want a grittier sandpaper to start out with. This is because non-sanded wood still has rough edges and splinters that will need to be removed before staining. Start at this grit for your first sanding session. Avoid using a belt sander. Belt sanders are used for larger staining jobs like wood floors. For a smaller job like a piece of furniture, a belt sander could damage the wood. For this job, you'll want to sand by hand instead."
