Set the suede down on a flat, solid surface, then hold the paper towel firmly against the oil stain. You may be able to take care of most of the oil before it becomes a bigger problem. For the best results, tackle the stain when it is fresh. Even if a stain sets in, you will have a much easier time cleaning it later."

Cornstarch is absorbent and very effective at drawing oil out of fabrics. If you don\u2019t have cornstarch, baking soda is a similar absorptive product. Talcum powder may also work well. At a minimum, leave the cornstarch on the stain for 30 minutes. If you have time, let it sit overnight to draw out as much oil as possible."
