    "For instance you will not need perfect special attack IVs on a Pok\u00e9mon that doesn't know special attacks.",
    "The best way to get perfect IVs is to breed Pok\u00e9mon that you already know has some good IVs.",
    "You can find out what your IVs are by speaking to a stats judge NPC and/or using an IV calculator.",
    "Plan your effort values (EVs).",
    "EVs are invisible stats just like IVs.",
    "However EVs can be changed.",
    "EVs all start at 0.",
    "EVs are earned by knocking out Pok\u00e9mon, Super Training or Pok\u00e9 Pelago.",
    "Each Pok\u00e9mon may earn up to 510 total EVs and no more than 252 EVs in a single stat.",
    "Put more EVs into the stats that your Pok\u00e9mon will need most.",
    "An extreme example of an all-out sweeper spread would be 252 speed EVs, 252 attack EVs, and 4 special attack EVs.",
    "Choose a nature.",
    "Your nature will usually raise one stat and lower another.",
    "However, there are neutral stats that do nothing.",
    "To choose a nature, pick your Pok\u00e9mon's most important stat and least important stat then look up which nature will raise and lower the desired stats.",
    "Design your Pok\u00e9mon to the last detail.",
    "Perfection isn't just about beating your opponents.",
    "It's about defeating them with style!",
    "Just imagine that male shiny Mega Gengar in a Premier Ball named King Boo!",
    "Choose a cool Pok\u00e9ball to contain all your perfection-ness.",
    "(Master Balls and Cherish Balls can't be inherited)\nJot down a perfect nickname for your Pok\u00e9mon!",
    "Pick a gender to match your nickname.",
    "It might not be super practical to be picky about gender, especially if you're going for a shiny with perfect IVs.",
    "But would it truly be perfect if you don't get the gender you want?",
    "Decide if it should be shiny.",
    "Some shiny Pok\u00e9mon don't look as good as their mundane counterparts.",
    "Produce the Perfect Egg Prepare a secondary Pok\u00e9mon game cartridge to produce the egg.",
    "You should breed your perfect egg on a secondary game cartridge so that your Pok\u00e9mon will have a lifelong bonus of 50% more experience when traded to the cartridge you intend to use it on.",
    "For a perfect exp bonus of 70% more, you need to use a Pok\u00e9mon game from a foreign language as your secondary game.",
    "Prepare two parent Pok\u00e9mon to Breed for desired traits.",
    "Pok\u00e9mon can inherit traits from their parents.",
    "Therefore, it is important to choose suitable parents.",
    "The mother of a Pok\u00e9mon is called a dam and the father is called a sire.",
    "Note that there are slightly different inheritance rules when breeding with Ditto.",
    "The dam must have the correct species and Pok\u00e9ball.",
    "The ideal dam will have the desired nature and ability, .",
    "The sire must know all desired egg moves.",
    "IV breed.",
    "Produce eggs until you hatch the perfect Pok\u00e9mon you designed.",
    "You'll have to check each hatching's IVs If one of the hatchlings would be a better sire/dam than your current sire/dam, put the superior hatchling into the daycare in place of its parent.",
    "Inbreeding at its finest!",
    "Give the parents items to speed up the process.",
    "The following items can help you influence what traits are inherited:\nEverstone: When given to the dam, there is a 50% chance of passing on its nature.",
    "Destiny Knot: When held by a parent, it ensures that five stats will be passed from either parent to the egg instead of the usual three.",
    "EV enhancing items: a power weight, power bracer, power belt, etc.",
    "Will ensure that the IV of the stat associated with that item will be passed on to the egg.",
    "This does not increase the number of stats inherited.",
    "Use the Masuda Method.",
    "This is important if you want a shiny Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "To use the Masuda Method, make sure the parents have different languages of origin.",
    "Example: one parent is from an English Pok\u00e9mon game and the other is from a German game.",
    "This will greatly increase your chances of getting a shiny to about 1 in 682.",
    "Note that the everstone does not work while the Masuda Method is invoked.",
    "Acquire a Shiny Charm.",
    "The Shiny Charm is a highly coveted key item that doubles the chance of encountering a shiny Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Combined with the Masuda Method, you would have a 1 in 341 chance of a shiny per egg.",
    "The Shiny Charm is acquired by completing the National Pok\u00e9dex (or Alola Pok\u00e9dex excluding mythical Pok\u00e9mon).",
    "This is very difficult to accomplish.",
    "Train the Perfect Pok\u00e9mon Infect your Pok\u00e9mon with the D strain of Pok\u00e9rus.",
    "Pok\u00e9rus is an extremely rare beneficial virus found on about 1 in every 21,845 wild.",
    "The D strain in particular is only found on 1 in every 87,381 wild Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Pok\u00e9rus doubles all EV yields.",
    "Catch a Pok\u00e9mon with Pok\u00e9rus or trade for an infected Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "When that Pok\u00e9mon is in your party, it will spread to the others in your party.",
    "The virus can die if it's host is in the party when midnight passes, so store infected Pok\u00e9mon in the PC at night.",
    "After a Pok\u00e9mon has been cured, it can not be infected again or spread to other Pok\u00e9mon but retains the benefits.",
    "Once you have Pok\u00e9rus experiment on an unimportant Pok\u00e9mon in your party.",
    "Record how many mid-nights  pass before the virus dies off.",
    "If it lasts until the fourth midnight, it is the D strain.",
    "Infect your perfect Pok\u00e9mon with this perfect virus.",
    "Never let your perfect Pok\u00e9mon fight it off.",
    "Don't taint your perfect Pok\u00e9mon with an inferior A, B, or C strain of Pok\u00e9rus.",
    "EV train.",
    "Get all stats up with Vitamins such as Protein.",
    "Don't feed it what it doesn't need.",
    "Doing so will give a Pok\u00e9mon 10 EV points in that stat, until it reaches 100 EVs, which is the highest you can reach with medicine.",
    "This is where EV-TRAINING plays a part!",
    "EVs, or Effort Values, are stat modifiers that improves different stats depending on which Pok\u00e9mon you defeat in battle.",
    "For instance, a Pidgey gives a +1 EV point to Speed, whilst a Staraptor gives +3 EV points to Attack.",
    "Every 4 EVs in a particular stat is equal to 1 point in that stat.",
    "Also, every Pok\u00e9mon is capable of having a maximum of 510 EVs with a maximum of 255 EVs in any one stat.",
    "Since neither 510 nor 255 are divisible by four, having 252 EVs in one stat is the most beneficial to you.",
    "Use this for your benefit, and train the stats you'd like to increase against Pok\u00e9mon that gives the correct EVs.",
    "Search for Pok\u00e9mon that yield desired EVs.",
    "- Flying-types are usually fast (Speed), Rock-types are sturdy (Defense) etc.",
    "A Pok\u00e9mon that hasn't evolved, or a Pok\u00e9mon that doesn't evolve at all, gives 1 EV point.",
    "A 1rst stage evolution Pok\u00e9mon gives 2 EV points, and a 2nd stage evolution Pok\u00e9mon gives 3 EV points, along with legendary Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Items like a Macho Brace double the EVs earned in battle, and the elusive Pokerus, should you be so lucky to ever experience it, doubles EV gain too.",
    "Teach it the moves.",
    "Know its weaknesses and teach it moves that can be used to hit Super Effective on the other Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Try to teach super tough moves like Earthquake.",
    "Teach moves that suit the Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Note that if an attacking move is used by a Pok\u00e9mon of the same type, it will be significantly more powerful, thanks to Same Type Effect Bonus (STAB), which can be useful.",
    "Use one PP Max on each move.",
    "Level up to level 100.",
    "Simple and straight forward.",
    "Depending on which game you are playing, you may not want to use Rare Candies all the way to level 100; if you do, it might lose the possibility to gain EVs.",
    "That is 126 stat points lost at lvl 100.",
    "If you want to be safe, make sure you have finished EV training it until you finish leveling it to lvl 100 (normally, since a lot of battling is required to reach lvl 100 without Rare Candy-ing it, these will fill completely up by themselves).",
    "Give your Pok\u00e9mon the held item you chose.",
    "Perfect your Pok\u00e9mon Develop your friendship.",
    "In each game, there is an NPC that can tell you if your friendship is perfect or not.",
    "If you don't have a perfect friendship, walk around with it in your party, give it a massage, feed it special berries etc.",
    "You can earn a ribbon for developing a perfect relationship with your Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Develop Affection.",
    "In Generation VI onward, affection can be gained by playing with your Pok\u00e9mon, petting your Pok\u00e9mon and feeding your Pok\u00e9mon via Pok\u00e9mon Amie.",
    "When your Pok\u00e9mon is affectionate, it will behave differently in battle.",
    "Sometimes, it will even shrug off a status effect or avoid being knocked out for it's trainer.",
    "Earn all possible ribbons.",
    "Some are easier to get, some are hard, some are impossible.",
    "You're perfect Pok\u00e9mon deserves to be as decorated as possible.",
    "Crown your Pok\u00e9mon with the Leaf Crown.",
    "In Heart Gold and Soul Silver, your Pok\u00e9mon can find rare shiny leaves when it follows you through certain routes.",
    "Collect all five to award your perfect Pok\u00e9mon a glorious crown."
