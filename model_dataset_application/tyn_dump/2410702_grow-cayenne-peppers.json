People who have colder weather should aim to grow them in a container, where they can be moved indoors and outside according to the heat.

      "description":"Although your seeds may be able to fertilize outdoors or in a container, cayenne peppers germinate best at a constant heat of 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 29 degrees Celsius), which is often too hot for places that frost or even regular indoor temperatures. Soak your pepper seeds in a glass of water overnight. Fill your grow packs up to 1/2 inch (1.3cm) from the top of the back with commercial seed starting mix. Place 3 or 4 cayenne pepper seeds in each cell. Try to space them evenly. Cover with 1/4 inch (0.6cm) of seed potting mix. Moisten the soil. Cover the grow pack with plastic wrap. Place it on a sunny windowsill or on the top of the refrigerator to germinate. Dampen the soil when needed over the next 1 to 6 weeks. Thin your seedlings over the next few weeks. First snip off the weakest seedling when they get their first leaves. Cut off all but 1 seedling when they form 2 sets of leaves. This seedling should be ready to plant, once there is no risk of frost."

If you plan to plant your pepper plants outside, you should add compost. The soil should be slightly acidic. You can add some aluminum sulfate to increase the acidity of the soil. If you plan to plant in a container, you can buy potting mix from a gardening store. You can also make your own potting mix with even ratios of loam, peat moss and sand. You will need to sterilize the mix in the oven for 1 hour. Place it in a shallow pan and heat it to 220 degrees Fahrenheit (140 degrees Celsius)."
