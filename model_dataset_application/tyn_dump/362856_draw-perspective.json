Draw it across the upper 1/3, center, or lower 1/3 of your paper, for instance.

You can place it anywhere off to either side if you like. You've probably seen drawings of a street that have the vanishing point on the center of the horizon.

For example, you could draw a street that narrows in the distance and sketch houses or trees alongside it. Remember that your subject should also be angled along the perspective lines. You could also make a drawing of the ocean with the sun rising or setting. The sun would be the vanishing point that makes the ocean look as though it extends far away from you. Keep in mind that the subjects closer to you should be larger than the ones that are near the horizon.

To make a building or cube, locate the perspective lines from the vanishing points that are on your horizon. Make a square along these lines to make the base.
