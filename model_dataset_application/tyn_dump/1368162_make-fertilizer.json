Seed meal is the byproduct of vegetable oils and is often used as animal feed. For the best results, get a certified organic bag to protect you and your plants. While fertilizer is normally measured in nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus levels, seed meal is measured in protein since it is usually livestock food.

All three of them will boost plant health and productivity the best, but if you're on a budget you can cut the recipe to just one of the three options. If you do only buy one form of lime, use dolomite whenever possible, as it contains essential magnesium."

To make the process more palatable, fill a bucket with sawdust and pee into this, dumping a large cup of water over it after you're done. You can then use this nutrient-rich mulch when planting your next batch of plants.

    "The steps above list many different household fertilizers, as well as their essential nutrients, allowing you to make a garden-specific program.",
    "You can get home testing kits, or you can bring your sample into a local garden store or county extension office for analysis.",
    "When pulling up a soil sample, follow the directions on the kit.",
    "If nothing is provided:\nUse clean, plastic shovels and a well-cleaned bucket.",
    "Dirty or metal implements can introduce other minerals and nutrients.",
    "Dig a hole 4-6\" deep, placing the dirt in the bucket.",
    "Do not include mulch or trimmings.",
    "Repeat with 4-5 holes, mixing together in a bucket.",
    "Dry the soil on newspaper for 12-24 hours.",
