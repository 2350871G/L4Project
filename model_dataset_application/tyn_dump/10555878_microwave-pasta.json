  "text":" Microwaving Pasta Break up the spaghetti noodles and place them in a bowl. Measure out as much spaghetti as you'd like to cook in the microwave. Then break the noodles into halves or thirds and put them in a microwave-safe bowl. Pour enough water to cover the noodles by 2 inches (5.1 cm). You can use room temperature water or just run water from the tap into the bowl. It's important that the noodles are completely submerged. The noodles will double or triple in size as they cook which is why they need to be covered with the water. Microwave the pasta for 3 minutes longer than the package instructs. Put the bowl in the microwave and read the pasta cooking instructions. Set the timer for 3 minutes longer than the manufacturer's recommendations. For example, if the package says to boil the noodles for 9 minutes, you'll need to microwave them for 12 minutes. Drain and use the cooked pasta. Carefully remove the hot bowl from the microwave. Set a colander in the sink and slowly pour the hot pasta into it so the water drains into the sink. Then top the cooked pasta with your favorite sauce. Refrigerate leftover cooked pasta in an airtight container for up to 3 to 5 days. Cooking the Pasta Using Boiling Water Break the dry spaghetti noodles and put them in a bowl. Get out 10.5 ounces (300 g) of uncooked spaghetti noodles and break them into thirds. They should easily fit into a microwave-safe bowl without sticking out. Coat the pasta with oil and pour in boiling water. Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil to the dry noodles and stir until they're all coated. Then pour in enough boiling water to cover the noodles by at least 2 inches (5.1 cm). Mixing the noodles with oil will prevent them from clumping together as they cook in the microwave. Microwave the spaghetti for 8 minutes. Put a lid on the dish or cover it with plastic wrap. Set the dish in the microwave and heat the pasta on full power for 8 minutes. Stop and stir the noodles once they're halfway cooked. Use caution when you stir the spaghetti since the dish will be hot. Remove the spaghetti and let it sit for 2 minutes. Once the spaghetti has rested for a few minutes, test a few noodles to see if they're as soft as you like. If they're too firm for you, return the noodles to the microwave and cook them for 2 more minutes. Drain and serve the spaghetti with sauce. Set a colander in the sink and slowly pour the cooked spaghetti into it. The hot water should drain into the sink. Then serve the hot spaghetti with your choice of sauce. To store leftover spaghetti noodles, put them in an airtight container and refrigerate them for up to 3 to 5 days. Microwaving Premade Sauce Pour a jar of pasta sauce into a large bowl. Choose a microwave-safe bowl that's large enough to contain any splatters from the sauce. If you want to microwave a smaller portion, just pour as much as you need into the bowl.Tip: Choose any kind of sauce you like, from marinara to alfredo! Microwave the sauce in 30-second increments. Put the bowl of pasta sauce in the microwave and use LOW power to heat the sauce. Stop and stir the sauce every 30 seconds as it heats. Keep in mind that it will take 2 to 3 minutes to heat a full jar of pasta sauce while a single portion might only take 1 minute. Spread the hot sauce over your cooked noodles. Once the pasta sauce is as hot as you'd like, remove it from the microwave and spoon it over cooked spaghetti noodles. Serve the sauce and noodles while they're hot. Cooking Meat Sauce in the Microwave Chop 1 onion, 1 garlic clove, and 1 carrot. Peel the produce and set them on a cutting board. Then use a sharp knife to chop the onion into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) pieces and mince the garlic clove. Dice the carrot into pea-sized pieces and transfer everything to a large microwave-safe bowl. If you're short on time, buy a package of ready-cut onions and carrots to use. Mix \u20443 pound (300 g) of lean ground beef with the veggies in the bowl.
