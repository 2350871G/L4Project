          "description":"A standard oven takes about 20 to 30 minutes to heat up. Turn the oven on while you prepare the pork so it\u2019s hot enough when the pork is ready to be cooked. Roasting the pork at a higher temperature in an attempt to cook it faster could result in burnt edges or an undercooked inside."

          "description":"Use a spoon to stir \u20444 teaspoon (1.2 ml) of kosher salt, \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of black pepper, and \u20442 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of garlic powder together. This creates your spice rub for the pork. Get creative with your spices, if you want. Substitute or add garlic powder, celery seed, onion powder, or seasoned salt, for example. Kosher salt is larger and coarser than table salt. However, you can use the latter if necessary."

          "headline":"Trim the silverskin off of the pork loin, leaving the white fat cap.",
          "description":"The silverskin is the thin, shiny connective tissue covering one side of the pork. Use a small boning knife to carefully cut it off. Don\u2019t remove the fat cap, though. That\u2019s what keeps the meat moist while it roasts. If you leave the silverskin on, the meat will be tough and chewy in those spots. Ask your butcher to remove the silverskin for you if you don\u2019t want to do it yourself or aren\u2019t sure where the silverskin is. Do this on a cutting board or other protective surface. When and How to Tie Your Pork Loin\nIf one end of your meat is much thinner than the other, you'll need to tie your loin. Fold the thin part back onto itself so that the entire loin is the same thickness. Use butcher's twine to tie the pork into place, or stick wooden toothpicks through it. If the pork loin is of even thickness throughout, tying it is not necessary."

          "description":"Use your hands to sprinkle the spice blend all over the top of the pork. Press gently yet firmly to make sure the seasoning sticks to the meat. The more you rub, the more the flavors will seep into the pork. Flip the pork over and rub the spices into the bottom, too,  if you want the entire piece of meat to be coated. Always wash your hands with soap and warm water after handling raw meat so you don\u2019t spread bacteria."

          "description":"By elevating the pork off of the bottom of the pan, you\u2019re preventing it from burning, as well as allowing better air circulation. You can use either a V-shaped rack or a flat rack in a 13 by 9 in (33 by 23 cm) pan. For easier cleanup, line the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil before placing the rack inside. If you don\u2019t have a rack or roasting pan, lay stalks of celery on the bottom of a deep baking pan. Place the pork on top of the celery."

Place the thermometer in the thickest part of the pork loin, typically the center, which is the section that will take the longest to cook.

          "headline":"Remove the pork from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before eating.",
          "description":"Allowing meat to rest gives it time to re-absorb some of the moisture and juices that were lost during cooking. If you cut into it too soon, the juices will just pour out of the meat, leaving it dry and tough. You can let the pork rest for longer than 5 minutes, but keep it under 15 minutes. Store any leftover pork in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Creative Ways to Eat Leftover Roast Pork\nMix it into a baked casserole with veggies, cheese, and rice. Stir fry the pork with lo mein noodles for an Asian dish. Shred it and eat it on a bun with BBQ sauce. Add it to soups or stews. Slice it into strips for pork tacos.
