If you are unclear about the directions, look for a customer service number or helpline that you can call. The instruction booklet will also tell you what kind of safety gear you\u2019ll need. Pay close attention to any of the kit\u2019s warning labels or notices. For example, it might advise you that certain types of tile, such as laminate, are not good candidates for refinishing.

          "description":"A new finish will probably make any imperfections even more obvious. Remove all caulking with a scraper and then follow up with a caulk remover liquid. If the refinishing glaze that you are using is opaque, don\u2019t worry too much about matching the replacement tile\u2019s color exactly with the old ones. After all, they will all look the same after the paint coating. Repair small cracks or minor chips by applying a polyester putty to the area and then smoothing it out. This will make the tile waterproof once more and the repairs will be covered up by the refinishing process. Scrape out enough grout and adhesive so the new tiles sit slightly below the existing tile. This makes it less noticeable if you reglaze it."

          "headline":"Remove the grout, if desired.",
          "description":"If your grout is cracking, falling apart, or extremely moldy, then go ahead and chisel it out before moving forward. Use a flat head screwdriver, small hammer, and utility knife to apply pressure to the caulk beads. They may peel right up or you may need to gradually chip them away with the knife. Always keep your hands away from the knife\u2019s path and go slowly. This step can get pretty messy, so keep a vacuum close by to suck up the dust and debris. Use a mix of muriatic acid and water to loosen the grout. Only use the acid if you are working in a well-ventilated area and wear a mask and gloves while handling it. You\u2019ll want to replace the grout either before painting or after the epoxy paint has cured. It is really your choice. Grout covered with epoxy paint will be uniform and easier to clean. But, some people like the look of grout lines."

          "headline":"Clean the tiles thoroughly.",
          "description":"Your kit will likely come with specific cleaning instructions. It might ask you to mix together an enclosed powder with water and then scrub it on the tile. If instructions are not provided, clean the tiles with bleach, a powdered cleaner (such as Comet), and a rust and lime remover. After each cleaner application, do a full rinse with water. If you are working with kitchen tiles, use a degreaser cleaner or rubbing alcohol to remove any oily residue."

        {
          "headline":"Wipe them down with sandpaper.",
          "description":"Go over each tile with 400/600 grit sandpaper. Choose the wet/dry type of paper, so that you can move on to sanding directly after cleaning. Move your hand in small circles or back and forth motions and try to cover all tiles evenly. Rinse off the tiles with water when you are finished. Remember that your goal is to remove any surface bumps and imperfections, not to sand it down to its base. Porcelain tiles need to be prepared with an etching liquid or a pumice block so the glaze will adhere to it. Sanding increases the lifespan of your refinishing job by allowing the epoxy paint to more fully adhered to the surface of your tiles. Don\u2019t get too discouraged if you can\u2019t see clear results from your sanding. Just keep going and rub your hands over the tile\u2019s surface to feel the change in texture."

You could even brush out the edges and then use a roller for the middle. After your first coat is finished, give it at least two hour to dry. Then, apply the next one. It\u2019s generally best to use a foam roller, as it will leave less of a pattern on the tile. And, if you use a paint pan, make sure to change out the liner and refresh the paint before applying a second coat. Otherwise, you may end up with dried paint lumps on your tile."
