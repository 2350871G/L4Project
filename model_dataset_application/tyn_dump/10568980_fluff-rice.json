Remove the pot of cooked rice from the heat and let it rest for 10 minutes or until it reaches your desired consistency. If there are flies in the kitchen, place a cotton tea towel over the pot to avoid any contamination. This method works for all varieties of rice, including basmati, brown, jasmine, and short grain white rice."

          "description":"Use a carving fork to gently stir the rice and break up any obvious lumps. A carving fork is an effective stirring utensil as it easily breaks up the grains of rice without mashing them together. This process gives the rice a fluffy consistency. Avoid using a spoon to mix the rice as this can make it mushy. Try not to stir the rice for longer than 1 minute as this can squish the grains."

          "description":"Freshly cooked fluffy rice is delicious! Eat it with a curry, stir-fry, or your favourite sauce. If you have leftover rice, transfer it into an airtight container and place it into the fridge. If you don\u2019t have an airtight container, use a resealable bag instead. If you want to keep the rice for longer, place the airtight container in the freezer for up to 6 months."

Rice paddles are designed to stir the grains without making them mushy \u2014 this helps to create light and fluffy rice. Rice cookers have a non-stick coating that stops the rice from baking onto the bottom of the pot. Rice paddles are made from plastic, making them a good non-abrasive choice to use with the cooker. Most rice cookers come with a rice paddle. If you don\u2019t have a paddle, purchase one from a speciality kitchen store. Alternatively, use a plastic fork or a plastic salad server. Avoid mixing the rice for over a minute as this can make it mushy."
