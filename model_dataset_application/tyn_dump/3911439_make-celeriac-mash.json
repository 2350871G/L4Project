  "text":" Preparing the Celeriac Look for celeriac that feels firm and appears heavy for its size. Avoid celeriac that looks brown or discolored. Clean the celeriac. Run the celeriac under running water to remove any excess dirt. Peel and chop up the celeriac. Cut off the bottom and top of the celeriac with a sharp knife. Then, use a potato peeler to remove the tough outer skin. Dice up the celeriac into \u00bd inch pieces. Expect to discard about a quarter of the celeriac one you have peeled and chopped it up. Making the Mash Heat the olive oil in a 4-quart saucepan over low heat. Once the olive oil just starts to simmer, add the chopped up celeriac, garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook approximately 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the celeriac begins to soften. If you\u2019re using dried or fresh thyme, add it in with the celeriac, garlic, salt, and pepper. Increase the heat and add the water or stock. Bring to a boil and then cook for about 20 - 25 minutes, until the celeriac is tender. Once the celeriac is cooked, you should be able to easily pierce through a piece of celeriac with a fork. Drain the celeriac through a colander. Then, return the celeriac to the pot. Use a stick blender to puree the celeriac for about 1 minute. Ensure there are no lumps and the celeriac is smooth. You can also use a masher for this step, but the blender will give you less of an arm workout. Place the butter and heavy cream into a microwave proof bowl. Heat them until the butter is melted, about 45 seconds. Add the cream and butter to the celeriac. Puree the ingredients with the stick blender for another minute or use the masher until they are well combined. If you\u2019d like to make a sweeter celeriac mash, add in a pinch of ground nutmeg and a pinch of ground ginger. Season the mash to taste.
