For the curved armrests and back legs in particular, it\u2019s easiest to transfer a grid pattern onto your lumber and trace the curves for your cuts in place.

You can find the transferrable grid patterns to use for these cuts at: https://www.familyhandyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FH01JUN_ADRCHR_05.pdf Use a circular saw to cut 2 tapered chair back slats (H). One of the Adirondack chair\u2019s signature elements is the fan-shaped chair back slats. While it\u2019s easier to cut the curved top radius of the slats after they\u2019ve all been attached to their supports, you should cut the tapers for 2 of the 4 back slats (H) before you start assembly. Once tapered, the 2 back slats (H) should be 2 in (5.1 cm) wide at the top and 0.625 in (1.59 cm) wide at the bottom. While you can cut tapers with a jigsaw, a circular saw does the job more accurately and quickly. Sand down any rough or sharp cut edges in the wood. Go over all your cut pieces of wood with 100-grit sandpaper, focusing especially on the cuts you\u2019ve made. You can use this coarser sandpaper to slightly \u201cround-over\u201d any sharp edges made by your cuts. Follow this up by going over everything with 150-grit sandpaper. Its finer grit will smooth the wood out nicely. Assembling the Chair Back Lay your chair back slats backside-up with proper spacing and alignment. Lay out the wood on a large workbench or an open, flat spot on your workshop floor. Cut at least 12, 0.25 in (0.64 cm)-wide spacers out of scrap wood. Place 2 spacers between each slat, one near the top and another near the bottom. Also make sure that the bottoms of each slat are in alignment. Once aligned with the spacers between them, the slats should be in the following order from left to right: tapered (H); untapered (H); (F); (A); (F); untapered (H); tapered (H). Align and pre-drill countersink holes into the horizontal chair back supports. Use 3 horizontal chair back supports to hold the slats in place\u2014one each near the top (N), middle (L), and bottom (G) of the slats. Lay the supports in place over top of the slats, then pre-drill screw holes into the supports, one hole over each slat. Piece (G) is aligned flush with the bottoms of the back slats; the top of (L) should be aligned 18 in (46 cm) from the bottom of (G); and the top of (N) should be 29 in (74 cm) from the bottom of (G). Use a countersink bit on your drill. Countersink bits are thicker at their base, which means they create a depression in the wood so that the screw heads \u201csink\u201d below the surface of the wood when they\u2019re screwed in. Glue and screw the horizontal supports in place. Apply dabs of weather-proof wood glue to each slat where the 3 horizontal supports will cover it. Put the supports (G), (L), and (N) back in place and drive 1.25 in (3.2 cm) screws into each countersink hole. Use this weather-proof wood glue on every connection point in the chair, along with screws. Mark and cut the top radius on the back slats with a jigsaw. To mark the radius, tie a nail and a pencil together at either end of a 14 in (36 cm) length of string. Place the pencil right at the top of (A), and place the nail into (A) further down so that the string is taut. Then, hold the nail firmly in place and run the pencil back and forth over the tops of the slats\u2014the string will guide it along the proper curve. Then, clamp the chair back in place and follow along your pencil line with a jigsaw to cut the top radius. Smooth out the cut with 100-grit sandpaper, followed by 150-grit. Finishing Assembly of the Chair Frame Assemble the front legs. The chair\u2019s two front legs (E) need to have notches cut into them to accept a horizontal support piece (D) that spans between them. Mark and cut these notches correctly with a jigsaw. Then, pre-drill countersink holes in each end of the support piece (2 per side), and glue and screw the support (D) in place. The notches in both (E) pieces should begin 10.75 in (27.3 cm) from the bottom and be 3.5 in (8.9 cm) wide and 0.75 in (1.9 cm) deep. Lay the legs horizontally on the table while you connect them with the support piece, then stand them upright (vertically) for the next step. Attach the back legs (B). The back legs of an Adirondack chair are positioned diagonally, from right behind the support piece (D) at the front legs to ground level. Use clamps to position the legs properly, then pre-drill 4 countersink holes per side where the back legs (B) meet the front legs (E). Remove the clamps, apply wood glue, put the clamps back on, screw the back legs in place, and remove the clamps one last time. As with the front legs, use 1.25 in (3.2 cm) screws to attach the back legs. Put on the arm supports (K), then the chair\u2019s arms (C). Glue and screw the 2 arm supports (K) in place so that each is flush with both the top and outer-facing front sides of their corresponding front leg (E).

Glue and screw back leg support (M) across the back legs, 0.75 in (1.9 cm) behind where the curved section of each leg begins. Then, align the chair back so that lower back cleat (G) is snug against the underside of (M), and the center back support (L) is snug against the undersides of the backs of each arm (C). While a friend holds the chair back in place, use at least 5 bar clamps to temporarily secure it in this position. After that, pre-drill 2 countersink holes per connection point at the arms (C) and back legs (B), remove the clamps, glue the joints, put the clamps back on, and screw the chair back in place. Secure the 6 seat slats (J) in place. Pre-drill 2 countersink holes at each end of every seat slat. Attach them to the back legs one at a time, starting with the front slat. Apply glue to its underside where it will rest on the legs, position it, and secure it with 1.25 in (3.2 cm) screws. Add each subsequent slat in the same manner. The seat slats should be spaced about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) apart. You can use spacers if you wish, but it\u2019s also fine to estimate the gap in this instance. If you are using a softwood (e.g., cedar) instead of a hardwood (e.g., poplar), use 1.625 in (4.13 cm) screws to secure the seat slats in place. Painting the Chair Apply a coat of exterior-grade, oil-based primer. Flip the chair upside-down to make it easier to apply primer to the underside, then flip it back over to do the rest of the chair. The job is easier if you have numerous brushes available\u2014use wider brushes (e.g., 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm)), or even a paint roller, for larger areas, and small craft/hobby brushes to get into the tight spaces of the chair. Allow the primer to dry overnight before proceeding. Sand the primer coat lightly with 120-grit sandpaper. Use a light touch, as your goal is simply to rough up the surface a bit so it accepts the top coat of paint better. Once you\u2019ve sanded over the primer coat, use a tack cloth or a clean rag to wipe away any dust. Add 1-2 coats of exterior-grade, oil-based paint. Apply your topcoat(s) in the same fashion as you did the primer coat. If you get sufficient coverage with one coat, you can stop there. Otherwise, wait overnight, lightly sand and wipe down the chair again, and apply a second coat. Once you\u2019re finished painting the chair, allow it to dry for at least 3 days before sitting on it.",

    " Gathering Your Supplies Use a hardwood like poplar for your Adirondack chair.",
    "Adirondack chairs are typically outdoor furniture made of painted wood, so durable hardwoods that can hold up to the elements are the best choice.",
    "Poplar is a strong but relatively lightweight hardwood, so consider using it to make your chair.",
    "If you prefer softwoods because they\u2019re a little easier to cut and work with, cedar is a good choice since it holds up very well outdoors.",

    "Trace the patterns for curved pieces onto the wood itself.",
    "The graceful curves of an Adirondack chair make it both beautiful and comfortable, but they also make cutting the wood for the project a bit tricky.",
    "For the curved armrests and back legs in particular, it\u2019s easiest to transfer a grid pattern onto your lumber and trace the curves for your cuts in place.",
    "Both chair arms (C) and both back legs (B) require curved cuts according to a pattern.",
    "You can find the transferrable grid patterns to use for these cuts at: https://www.familyhandyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FH01JUN_ADRCHR_05.pdf Use a circular saw to cut 2 tapered chair back slats (H).",
    "One of the Adirondack chair\u2019s signature elements is the fan-shaped chair back slats.",
    "While it\u2019s easier to cut the curved top radius of the slats after they\u2019ve all been attached to their supports, you should cut the tapers for 2 of the 4 back slats (H) before you start assembly.",
    "Once tapered, the 2 back slats (H) should be 2 in (5.1 cm) wide at the top and 0.625 in (1.59 cm) wide at the bottom.",
    "While you can cut tapers with a jigsaw, a circular saw does the job more accurately and quickly.",
    "Sand down any rough or sharp cut edges in the wood.",
    "Go over all your cut pieces of wood with 100-grit sandpaper, focusing especially on the cuts you\u2019ve made.",
    "You can use this coarser sandpaper to slightly \u201cround-over\u201d any sharp edges made by your cuts.",
    "Follow this up by going over everything with 150-grit sandpaper.",
    "Its finer grit will smooth the wood out nicely.",
    "Assembling the Chair Back Lay your chair back slats backside-up with proper spacing and alignment.",
    "Lay out the wood on a large workbench or an open, flat spot on your workshop floor.",
    "Cut at least 12, 0.25 in (0.64 cm)-wide spacers out of scrap wood.",
    "Place 2 spacers between each slat, one near the top and another near the bottom.",
    "Also make sure that the bottoms of each slat are in alignment.",
    "Once aligned with the spacers between them, the slats should be in the following order from left to right: tapered (H); untapered (H); (F); (A); (F); untapered (H); tapered (H).",
    "Align and pre-drill countersink holes into the horizontal chair back supports.",
    "Use 3 horizontal chair back supports to hold the slats in place\u2014one each near the top (N), middle (L), and bottom (G) of the slats.",
    "Lay the supports in place over top of the slats, then pre-drill screw holes into the supports, one hole over each slat.",
    "Piece (G) is aligned flush with the bottoms of the back slats; the top of (L) should be aligned 18 in (46 cm) from the bottom of (G); and the top of (N) should be 29 in (74 cm) from the bottom of (G).",
    "Use a countersink bit on your drill.",
    "Countersink bits are thicker at their base, which means they create a depression in the wood so that the screw heads \u201csink\u201d below the surface of the wood when they\u2019re screwed in.",
    "Glue and screw the horizontal supports in place.",
    "Apply dabs of weather-proof wood glue to each slat where the 3 horizontal supports will cover it.",
    "Put the supports (G), (L), and (N) back in place and drive 1.25 in (3.2 cm) screws into each countersink hole.",
    "Use this weather-proof wood glue on every connection point in the chair, along with screws.",
    "Mark and cut the top radius on the back slats with a jigsaw.",
    "To mark the radius, tie a nail and a pencil together at either end of a 14 in (36 cm) length of string.",
    "Place the pencil right at the top of (A), and place the nail into (A) further down so that the string is taut.",
    "Then, hold the nail firmly in place and run the pencil back and forth over the tops of the slats\u2014the string will guide it along the proper curve.",
    "Then, clamp the chair back in place and follow along your pencil line with a jigsaw to cut the top radius.",
    "Smooth out the cut with 100-grit sandpaper, followed by 150-grit.",
    "Finishing Assembly of the Chair Frame Assemble the front legs.",
    "The chair\u2019s two front legs (E) need to have notches cut into them to accept a horizontal support piece (D) that spans between them.",
    "Mark and cut these notches correctly with a jigsaw.",
    "Then, pre-drill countersink holes in each end of the support piece (2 per side), and glue and screw the support (D) in place.",
    "The notches in both (E) pieces should begin 10.75 in (27.3 cm) from the bottom and be 3.5 in (8.9 cm) wide and 0.75 in (1.9 cm) deep.",
    "Lay the legs horizontally on the table while you connect them with the support piece, then stand them upright (vertically) for the next step.",
    "Attach the back legs (B).",
    "The back legs of an Adirondack chair are positioned diagonally, from right behind the support piece (D) at the front legs to ground level.",
    "Use clamps to position the legs properly, then pre-drill 4 countersink holes per side where the back legs (B) meet the front legs (E).",
    "Remove the clamps, apply wood glue, put the clamps back on, screw the back legs in place, and remove the clamps one last time.",
    "As with the front legs, use 1.25 in (3.2 cm) screws to attach the back legs.",
    "Put on the arm supports (K), then the chair\u2019s arms (C).",
    "Glue and screw the 2 arm supports (K) in place so that each is flush with both the top and outer-facing front sides of their corresponding front leg (E).",
    "Then, use bar clamps to position the chair\u2019s arms properly\u2014flush with the front legs (E) on the inside, and overhanging the front legs by 3 in (7.6 cm) at the front of the chair.",
    "Pre-drill 3 countersink holes per side over top of the front legs (E) and supports (K), then remove the clamps, add wood glue, and attach the arms with 1.25 in (3.2 cm) screws.",
    "The backs of the arms won\u2019t be supported by anything yet, so keep the bar clamps in place for now.",
    "Attach the chair back to the back legs and arms.",
    "Glue and screw back leg support (M) across the back legs, 0.75 in (1.9 cm) behind where the curved section of each leg begins.",
    "Then, align the chair back so that lower back cleat (G) is snug against the underside of (M), and the center back support (L) is snug against the undersides of the backs of each arm (C).",
    "While a friend holds the chair back in place, use at least 5 bar clamps to temporarily secure it in this position.",
    "After that, pre-drill 2 countersink holes per connection point at the arms (C) and back legs (B), remove the clamps, glue the joints, put the clamps back on, and screw the chair back in place.",
    "Secure the 6 seat slats (J) in place.",
    "Pre-drill 2 countersink holes at each end of every seat slat.",
    "Attach them to the back legs one at a time, starting with the front slat.",
