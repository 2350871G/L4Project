Turn the heat until medium-high and allow the pan to warm. It\u2019s very important to measure the drippings carefully. If you don\u2019t add enough, the gravy will wind up lumpy."

Allow the gravy to cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the mixture is smooth and bubbling slightly. Make sure to stir the gravy constantly while it\u2019s cooking to prevent lumps.
