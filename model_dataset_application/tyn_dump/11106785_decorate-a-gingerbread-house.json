          "description":"To decorate a gingerbread house, you're going to need a lot of icing. The best type of icing to use is royal icing because it dries hard and is long lasting \u2013 perfect for keeping your gingerbread house put together throughout the holiday season. You can make your own royal icing, or you can purchase it from a baking company or grocery store. Some stores sell royal icing in a variety of colors. You may want to use white icing for snow, green icing for Christmas trees, and red and blue icing for colorful lights. If you can't find any or want to make your own colors, purchase some soft gel paste food coloring. To make different colors, pour your icing into separate bowls. Add 1-2 drops of your preferred food coloring, and then mix it with a spoon until the colors are evenly distributed. If you want to make the color darker, add a couple more drops and mix it again."

          "description":"To neatly apply the icing, you'll also need piping bags. All you need to do is put the icing you're going to use inside the bag, and squeeze it from the top until the icing comes out of the tip. Piping bags can be purchased at most grocery stores, or you can make your own using plastic bags or parchment paper. If you're using multiple piping bags during your gingerbread decorating, lay a damp towel over the tips of the piping bags to prevent the icing from hardening. To create different effects with your piping bags, you can buy some with various tip shapes and sizes. For example, some piping bags have round tips that create a clean dot of icing, while other piping bags have star tips that create a more detailed icing dot."

Look for round peppermint candies, candy canes, red gumdrops, hot tamales, and any other red candies you enjoy. Also, consider red and white icing to stick with the peppermint theme. Round peppermint candies make great mini wreaths or windows. Attach them on the sides of the house to add d\u00e9cor to your candy cane house. Use two candy canes in front of your gingerbread house to act as lampposts. To keep them upright, lean them against the corners of the roof and secure them with royal icing."

Make sure to incorporate white candy, such as white M&Ms, yogurt raisins, and coconut flavor jellybeans. To keep with the all-white theme, you can use white icing to outline the door and windows, make a wreath, and even Christmas trees next to your house. If you want to add a little color while sticking with the winter wonderland theme, use green icing to make Christmas trees and then add white icing on top for snow. You can also add color to parts of the house, such as blue icing on the door or red icing on the windows."

Make sure the icing is spread evenly so your gingerbread house looks neat. If you plan on adding candies to the roof after applying the icing, do so quickly while the icing is still soft. They will stick to the roof and stay on even after the icing dries."

This will add fun, whimsical d\u00e9cor to your gingerbread house. To do this, put your choice of colored icing in a piping bag. Hold the bag close to the surface of the roof, and squeeze it slowly until the icing begins to come out. Make your roof shingles by using your icing to draw a series of half circles in a row along the length of the roof. Keep making rows of shingles until your entire roof is covered.

You can also make the icicles using just the piping bags. All you need to do is squeeze the bag, let the icing build, then start to pull the tip down slowly.

Using a piping bag with a very fine tip, draw horizontal lines along the walls of your house. Space them to make your bricks as wide or thin as you'd like. When the horizontal lines are finished, add vertical lines to make your brick shapes. Make sure to stagger the vertical lines instead of drawing them straight down from top to bottom to make the bricks more realistic.

Then, cover the wall by placing jellybeans on the icing. Make sure the entire wall is covered with jellybeans close together, so it looks like a cobblestone wall, instead of jellybeans just randomly placed. If you want the cobblestone to appear more realistic, use jellybeans that are stone colors, such as brown, grey, and tan. These color jellybeans may be found at a specialty online candy store."

When you're finished rolling out your gumdrops, use a pair of scissors to cut them into strips, then stick them together. Cut your flattened gummies to the window shape you prefer, then use your royal icing to stick them to the side of your house. If you want a quick and easy way to make stained glass windows, purchase fruit roll-ups with multiple flavors to apply to your walls as windows. Make sure to cut them first to get your desired window shape."

To make the wreath, you'll need to make several dots with your piping bag to form a circle. Position the bag straight out and hold the tip slightly off the surface. Squeeze gently, then stop and pull the tip away when you have your desired size. To make your wreath appear fuller, use different shades of green icing, and make your dots different sizes.

    "Using a piping bag with a very fine tip, draw horizontal lines along the walls of your house.",
    "Space them to make your bricks as wide or thin as you'd like.",
    "When the horizontal lines are finished, add vertical lines to make your brick shapes.",
    "Make sure to stagger the vertical lines instead of drawing them straight down from top to bottom to make the bricks more realistic.",
    "White icing looks best for bricks on a gingerbread house, but you can choose any color icing you prefer.",
    "Make a cobblestone wall with jellybeans and icing.",
    "A cobblestone wall will give your gingerbread house a professional look.",
    "To construct the wall, smear a thin layer of white icing along the length of the wall.",
    "Then, cover the wall by placing jellybeans on the icing.",
    "Make sure the entire wall is covered with jellybeans close together, so it looks like a cobblestone wall, instead of jellybeans just randomly placed.",
    "If you want the cobblestone to appear more realistic, use jellybeans that are stone colors, such as brown, grey, and tan.",
    "These color jellybeans may be found at a specialty online candy store.",
    "Use gumdrops to make stained glass windows.",
    "Add a beautiful and interesting element to your gingerbread house by creating stained glass windows.",
    "Place a gumdrop on a cutting board and use a rolling pin to roll the gummy until it is completely flat.",
    "Repeat this flattening process with at least 3 different color gummies.",
    "When you're finished rolling out your gumdrops, use a pair of scissors to cut them into strips, then stick them together.",
    "Cut your flattened gummies to the window shape you prefer, then use your royal icing to stick them to the side of your house.",
    "If you want a quick and easy way to make stained glass windows, purchase fruit roll-ups with multiple flavors to apply to your walls as windows.",
    "Make sure to cut them first to get your desired window shape.",
    "Make a wreath for your gingerbread house with green icing.",
    "Fill a piping bag that has a star tip with green icing to make a Christmas wreath on the front of your house.",
    "To make the wreath, you'll need to make several dots with your piping bag to form a circle.",
    "Position the bag straight out and hold the tip slightly off the surface.",
    "Squeeze gently, then stop and pull the tip away when you have your desired size.",
    "To make your wreath appear fuller, use different shades of green icing, and make your dots different sizes.",
    "If you want something more interesting and colorful, make a pom-pom wreath.",
    "Use the same technique as the method above, but use round tip piping bags and use various colors for your icing.",
    "Creating a Yard and Adding the Finishing Touches Spread royal icing on the base of your house for a snowy yard.",
    "Secure your gingerbread house to a flat board with royal icing.",
    "Then, to give it the appearance of snow on the ground around it, add icing to the board.",
    "Spread it around with a butter knife or an angled spatula to place the icing in an even layer.",
    "Create a walkway using gumdrops.",
    "An interesting way to add some d\u00e9cor around your gingerbread house is to make a path leading up to the door.",
    "To make the walkway, add two lines of icing leading up to each side of the door.",
    "Then, put a line of gumdrops on the icing so that it creates a path.",
    "You can also make a cobblestone path leading up to the door using jellybeans.",
    "To do this, add a layer of icing leading up to the door.",
    "Then, stick jellybeans on the icing packed closely together so they resemble cobblestone.",
    "Add pretzels to your gingerbread yard to create a fence.",
    "For this step, you need hard pretzels.",
    "You can use small pretzel sticks or the traditional knotted pretzel.",
    "Add a line of icing to the base to create a border around your gingerbread house.",
    "Then, place the pretzels side-by-side on top of the icing to create the fence.",
    "To ensure that the pretzels don't fall over, line the base of the pretzels with icing on each side.",
    "Line the top of the pretzels with icing to create the look of fallen snow on the fence.",
    "Use ice cream cones and green icing to make Christmas trees.",
    "Add more holiday elements surrounding the house with some Christmas trees.",
    "To do this, get an ice cream cone wafer and put it upside down in front of the house.",
    "Put some green icing in a piping bag with a star tip and add dots of icing around the cone.",
    "Then, pour some sprinkles on the tree to look like Christmas tree lights.",
    "To make the trees more realistic, use different shades of green icing as well as different size piping bag tips.",
    "Sprinkle the house with confectioners' sugar to imitate freshly fallen snow.",
    "Confectioners' sugar, or powdered sugar, is tasty and perfect to add to your finished gingerbread house.",
    "Just grab a handful in your fingers and lightly sprinkle it over your roof and yard.",
    "You can also use shredded coconut flakes for bigger snowflakes, or edible glitter to make it sparkle."
