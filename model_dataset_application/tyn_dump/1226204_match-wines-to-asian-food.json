The Rieslings and Traminers are a good choice. Avoid oaky and buttery whites, or neutral and dry whites for the most part. Restaurant styles for Asian food include: Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Merlot, and Italian varietals (such as Barbera and Sangiovese)."

Modern New World white wines are better able to cope with the bitter, sour, and astringent complexities found in curries and other Indian hot food than classic European wines. Pinot Gris is a good choice for richly flavored and textured Asian food, such as Vietnamese pork, or prawn rolls with a peanut sauce. Avoid heavy tannins and oak with hot Asian food and experiment with chilling the wine lightly before use."
