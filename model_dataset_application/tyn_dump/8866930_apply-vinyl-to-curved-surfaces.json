Wipe the surface completely dry after cleaning, then mark the placement of your design with painter\u2019s tape. You can substitute another weak adhesive tape, like masking tape, for painter\u2019s tape. Weak adhesive tape will be easier to remove later and isn\u2019t likely to leave behind an adhesive film. For a more precise outline, use a grease pencil to draw the placement of your design on the surface. Some surfaces may react negatively to grease pencils. Test pencils on an out of sight area first."

Then cut excess vinyl backing from the design with scissors. Leave a small border of adhesive backing around the design. If you\u2019re applying vinyl lettering to an item, don\u2019t forget to cut out the empty spaces, like the middle parts of the letters A and O. It may be difficult to remove small pieces of vinyl from designs. In these situations, try to lift unneeded pieces of vinyl from their backing with the edge or tip of your utility knife."

Starting from one side of the design, use your fingers to apply the tape or paper to the vinyl and its backing a little bit at a time. Your tape or paper doesn\u2019t have to be attached to the vinyl and its backing perfectly. Wrinkles and bubbles in the tape or paper shouldn\u2019t transfer to the vinyl design. To ensure the tape or paper is firmly attached to the vinyl, press the paper to the vinyl design with your nail using moderate force. You can similarly use a rigid edge to do this, like a credit card."

Start from the edge closest to the tape and work your way to the outside of the design. This will prevent bubbling and wrinkles.
