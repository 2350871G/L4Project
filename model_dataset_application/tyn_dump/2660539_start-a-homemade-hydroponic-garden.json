Then, the tray is drained. Usually, people with ebb and flood systems use a submersible pump to do this, working from a nutrient reservoir. If you're using a pump, set up your flood and drain system. Most people place the growing pan above the nutrient reservoir in a larger container, say, a bucket. You'll then need to connect the pan and reservoir with the submersible pump and tubing, so the pump can deliver nutrient solution into the tray. You'll also need to install an overflow pipe to drain the solution back into the reservoir. If you're flooding manually, use at least one cup of water (depending on how many pots there are) and pour it over the pan. Make sure the water gets into each pot. Allow some time for the water to soak into the pots\u2014at least five minutes should be enough. Drain the excess water into the pan by tipping it and allowing the water to drain into a bucket."

You'll want to test materials to see what works best. Be sure that your wick is absorbent but resists rotting. Washing the wick before you use it often helps to improve wicking ability, as well.

Then, thread in your wicks and put the containers in place. Try to spread out the wicks evenly on the bottom of the growing tray. Finally, add your growing medium to the bottom of the tray so that it covers the wicks. Wick systems need an absorbent medium like vermiculite, coco coir, or perlite. Also, be sure to flush out the medium with fresh water about every two weeks, as this will reduce the risk of nutrients and salts building up to toxic levels."
