A mason jar or plastic container with a lid works well for home bakers. Don't use an airtight container, since the starter needs some air to grow. You can also cover a container loosely with a towel or plastic wrap. A glass container or clear plastic is ideal because you can see inside to monitor the sourdough starter. Keep in mind that a sourdough starter can double in size. Choose a container that is big enough for your starter to grow."

Dry out your starter first, by rolling it out on a piece of parchment paper and leaving it alone for a day or so. Grind the starter into powder in a food processor and then keep it in the freezer. To revive a frozen, dehydrated sourdough starter, add 1 cup (240 mL) of warm, filtered water to the powder and mix it. After a half an hour, check to see if it is too solid or too liquid, and add water or flour to bring it to the right consistency."

For example, if you have around 2/3 cups of starter that weighs 130g, you will need to feed it 2/3 cups of water and 1 cup (130 g) of flour. Use a kitchen scale to measure equal weights of the three ingredients. If your starter is getting too big, simply discard half of it before feeding it. It will quickly grow again."

In a cooler kitchen, feed your sourdough starter once a day. Feed it twice a day in a warmer kitchen. An ideal room temperature is around 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C). Each sourdough starter is a little bit different, so feed it once a day and increase feedings to twice a day if you notice the mixture is starting to get flat and loose bubbles at the end of the day."

However, if you don't bake that often, you may need to throw away part of your starter when you feed it to keep it from getting too big. If there is gray water on top of your fridge-stored sourdough starter, that's normal. Just stir it in with the mixture when you feed it. You can go 2 weeks without feeding a starter you store in the fridge, as long as you don't do it too often and you feed it as soon as possible after 2 weeks. Try not to do this more than twice a year."

To revive dormant starter, add 1 cup (240 mL) of warm, filtered water to the mixture and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes."

A healthy sourdough starter will slowly rise and fall in between feedings, giving it a domed top. The starter should be full of bubbles throughout the day. If your sourdough starter doesn't look healthy, you may need to change the temperature of the room, amount of feedings, or water temperature you use to feed your starter."
