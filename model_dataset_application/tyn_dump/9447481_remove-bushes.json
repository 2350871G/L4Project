Never attempt this with any vehicle smaller than a truck. If you don\u2019t have a truck, you can rent one. You may not want to do this in case something goes wrong."

Using a Jack Cut away the branches of the tree with clippers. Start on the outside of the tree, removing the smaller branches. This can also be done with other tools, such as a saw. Shovel a trench around the bush. Use your pointed shovel or garden shovel to expose the bush\u2019s roots. Dig all the way around the bush so the roots to expose the roots on all sides. Cut the roots with an axe. Use an axe or mattock to sever the exposed roots. If you don\u2019t have one, you may be able to do this with a pointed shovel or saw. Place plywood boards on either side of the bush. Stack 2 or 3 flat boards on either side of the bush. The boards help give the jack more height to raise the bush. Set up a jack stand on one side of the bush. Jack stands can be found at auto parts stores. Set it on one of the plywood board stacks with the lifting arm facing upwards. If you don\u2019t have a jack stand, stack 2 or 3 concrete blocks on top of the plywood instead. Place the jack on the other side of the bush. Lay the jack on top of the other plywood stack.

Scissor jacks, which often come packaged with cars, aren\u2019t recommended. They\u2019re a little more flimsy and only designed to lift your specific type of car. Place a wood beam over the jack and jack stand. A 4 in \u00d7 6 in (10 cm \u00d7 15 cm) beam is the standard size, although you may need a longer one for bigger bushes. Rest one end on the jack and the other end on the jack stand. Tie the stump to the beam with a towing chain. Double-check the towing chain to make sure it isn\u2019t damaged.

Put on safety goggles and clear the area. You will be putting lots of pressure on the beam and chain. Either one can recoil, so wear eye protection in case this happens. Have any children, pets, or onlookers stand far away or go inside. Crank the jack to raise it. Crank the mechanical arm on the jack. The arm will raise the beam, lifting the stump. If the stump doesn\u2019t lift enough, lower the jack and place a few wood blocks on the jack\u2019s arm underneath the beam. Saw off the exposed roots.
