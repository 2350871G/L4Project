  "text":" Unclogging a Garbage Disposal Locate your garbage disposal's operating manual, if you can. It can instruct you on recommended garbage disposal repairs and give you a diagram of the disposal before you take anything apart. Find the hex wrench that came with the disposal. This tool is usually kept near the disposal for small repairs. A hex wrench is a small, thin metal tool. It has 6 sides and it tightens the mounting bolts on the disposal. It is often referred to as a hex key and is used for bike repairs and furniture construction. Turn off the garbage disposal using the circuit breaker. Occasionally, wall switches are not properly connected, so there should be no chance that power can get to the impellers. Hold a flashlight above the garbage disposal. Attempt to see down the disposal and find the cause of the clog. Remove the drain cover, or rubber catch, if possible.  Stick a hex wrench or wooden spoon handle into the disposal. Rock it from side to side between the impellers to try to loosen any caught food. If you find some hard object, such as a bone, try to grasp it with tongs and pull it up. It is preferable to forcing it down the hoses. Turn on the power once you believe the disposal is unclogged. If you believe it is still clogged, leave the power off. You will need to go underneath the sink and remove the hoses that attach to the disposal. You can clear the impellers with the hex wrench from below. Turn on the water. Turn on the disposal. See if the disposal appears to be running better. Servicing Leaking Hoses Look in the area underneath your sink. If it is wet, you have a problem with the hoses and/or seals. Try to catch the liquid. The color and contents will tell you where the leak is coming from. If the liquid is brown and discolored, then the leak is probably coming from a dishwasher intake or drain pipe. If the liquid is clear, it is most likely a leak from the sink. Run your hand across the garbage disposal seal on the sink, drain pipe and/or dishwasher intake. You may be able to feel where water is dripping. Try to tighten the mounting bolts around the seal. This may solve your problem without requiring further repair. Turn on the water to see if the leak continues. Purchase a new seal, when you have determined the area it is leaking from. You may need to shut off the water source, take apart the hose and remove the seal. Take the seal to a hardware store to make sure you get the right item. Replace the seal. Tighten the mounting bolts and try the disposal again. Fixing a Flywheel Determine if the impellers in your garbage disposal aren't turning. If this is the case, and you have checked for garbage disposal clogs, the cause may be the flywheel. Leaking from the bottom of the disposal may also be a problem with the flywheel. In this case the flywheel seal needs to be replaced. Follow the instructions in the method above to replace it. Do not test your garbage disposal for longer than 10 seconds, if the wheels aren't turning. A caught flywheel can burn out the motor in the disposal. Go underneath the sink to access the disposal. Make sure power is completely off. Find the hex holes. Use your hex wrench to loosen the flywheel at the bottom of the disposal. Remove any debris that is stuck in the disposal's flywheel.  Loosen the lock nut on the flywheel and remove it, if you believe the problem is caused by the impeller blades.  Remove all the hose fittings that are connected to the disposal flywheel and impellers.  Remove debris in the impellers, if that is the cause of the problem.  Sharpen impellers in place or by removing them. This can help to avoid future clogs, if food debris was the cause of your problem. Read the instruction manual. If it says that blades cannot be sharpened, or if you cannot find the cause of the problem, you may need to send for a new flywheel assembly.",
