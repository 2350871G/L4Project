Then, soak a cotton ball in the oil, and dab it over your forehead, behind your ears, and down your neck. The oil masks your scent from the gnats so they are less likely to notice you.

To make your own spray, fill a 4 oz (118 mL) glass spray bottle about halfway with distilled water, 1 oz (30 mL) of witch hazel, and 50-75 drops of any essential oil combination you'd like. Shake the mixture before spraying it over your arms and torso. If you do not dilute the essential oil, you can get burned if your skin is in the sun.
