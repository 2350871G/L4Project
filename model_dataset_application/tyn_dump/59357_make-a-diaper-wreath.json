Then, have someone hold the diaper in place and tie a bow to secure it to the form. Do this for each diaper until they\u2019re all attached to the wreath where you placed them before. If you don\u2019t have someone to hold the diaper for you, use a piece of masking tape to secure the diaper to the form so that it doesn\u2019t move while you tie the ribbon. Once you have the diaper tied on, you can remove the tape. You can leave the bows on the front of the diapers, or you can slide the ribbon so that the bow faces the back of the wreath. If you\u2019re using a cardboard or foam wreath form, you can tie the ribbon around the back of the form to hold the diaper in place.
