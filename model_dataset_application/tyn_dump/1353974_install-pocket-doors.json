Check if the wall is load-bearing or just a partition. If it is load bearing, you'll need a new header and a means of temporary support while the door is being worked on.

If the floor covering above the subfloor is minimal, the split-stud brackets can be secured directly to the floor. To determine the header height for most standard kits, figure the length of the new door, plus 3 1/4\" and the height of the soleplate, if any. Once the appropriate length is determined, install a new stud this length from the existing stud on the opposing side. Nail the new header in place (or screw) and then cut and fit the soleplate to the floor. To adjust the header, use a reciprocating saw to remove the partition header currently in place. Then, cut away the studs, just like in the above, to make space for the framing. Cut the nails that are between the studs and the soleplate and then determine the height of your desired header before cutting the stud tops to length. Otherwise, you may end up with a frame that is not to size."

If you are also installing pre-split studs, you can install them after you install the slider track. If you need to cut the track to length, use the mark on it that corresponds to your door size. Most, if not all, kits come with these markers. Use a hacksaw on the channel and a handsaw on the nailers. Make sure your track is level.
