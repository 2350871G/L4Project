You can usually get grass-fed beef suet from a butcher, but it\u2019s best to call ahead to make sure. You can also use sheep or lamb suet, but those are much harder to find. Cold beef fat is easiest to work with. If you bought yours frozen, pop it in the fridge to defrost it. It usually takes about 24 hours to defrost in the fridge."

The fat will slowly start to liquefy as it heats up, which is what you want. A large slow cooker or stew pot should be the right size for this. Consider using a pot that you will dedicate to tallow-making in the future, since the rendering process will leave behind a waxy residue that is hard to clean off.
