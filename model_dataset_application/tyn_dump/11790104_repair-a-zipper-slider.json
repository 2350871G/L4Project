If you find a spot that you think might be the culprit, pinch it firmly between your thumb and forefinger and tug it gently in the direction opposite the one that the zipper runs in. Some tweezers can be a big help if you need a way to get a better grip on a small section of bunched material. Keep a delicate touch here and only use as much force as you absolutely need to. If you\u2019re not careful, you could easily do damage to the zipper or the surrounding fabric."

Run it lightly over both halves of the teeth for a few seconds, then stop and try the zipper again. With any luck, it will go back to tracking smoothly with no further problems.It may take you several attempts to get the slider started again, so be patient. The tiny particles of graphite dust left behind by the pencil will reduce the friction between the slider and the teeth, allowing the slider to move freely again.Tip: Sharpen your pencil to a slender point to lengthen its reach and help work it deeper into the slider."

Just apply a small amount of your substance of choice directly to the locked-up teeth and work the zipper back and forth a few times. Other products that may be able to liberate an immobilized zipper include baby powder, coconut oil, dish soap, WD-40, crayons, candles, or wax paper. Use a cotton swab to apply liquid lubricants like Windex, olive oil, and dish soap without making a complete mess of the garment or accessory you\u2019re fixing. When you\u2019re done, you may want to launder your item or give it a thorough wipedown with a damp cloth or wet wipe to clear away any remaining traces of the slippery lubricant."
