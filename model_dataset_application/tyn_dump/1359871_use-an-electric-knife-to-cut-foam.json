Turn on the knife and insert the tip of its blade into one of your pattern lines at a perpendicular angle until the knife has reached the underside of the foam block; do not cut further yet. Switch off the knife. Check beneath the knife to make sure it emerged on the underside pattern lines you marked. Turn the knife back on and start cutting; continue to hold your electric knife at a perpendicular angle for the duration of the cut to keep your cuts' edges straight. Allow the knife to glide gently along the foam's insides instead of applying too much pressure. Apply a gentle up-and-down sawing motion when necessary."
