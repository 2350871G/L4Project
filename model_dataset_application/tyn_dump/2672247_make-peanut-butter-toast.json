  "text":" Basic Peanut Butter Toast Put the bread slices in the toaster. Toast to your preferred level of toasting. While you are waiting for the bread to toast, get ready a plate, butter knife, and the peanut butter. Remove the toast from the toaster. Place them on the plate. Dip the knife in the peanut butter. Spread it on the toast as thickly or as thinly as you like. Add a sweetener. This step is optional but if you like it sweet, spread on a little honey or maple syrup. If you do add either sweetener, spread it on all over the toast to improve the flavor. Put onto a plate ready for serving. Share with someone else if you like. You can cut the toast into halves or quarters, as preferred, or leave whole. Peanut Butter Toast with Bananas Place the bread slices into the toaster. Toast to the level of toasting you prefer. Slice the banana. Cut into evenly sized slices, thick or thin. Don't cut too thick or you'll have a tough time eating it. Remove the toast from the toaster. Spread the peanut butter across the toasted slices. Arrange the banana slices neatly across each slice of peanut-buttered toast.  Finish by drizzling honey or syrup over the top. You can also sprinkle with cinnamon or nutmeg for a sweet spicy taste but this is optional. Serve. Eat whole or cut into halves or quarters. Peanut Butter Toast with Strawberries Place the bread slices into the toaster. Toast to the level of toasting you prefer. Slice the strawberries in halves. Cut into evenly sized slices, thick or thin. Remove the toast from the toaster. Spread the peanut butter across the toasted slices. Arrange the strawberry halves over each slice of peanut-buttered toast. They can be piled on, there is no need for perfection. Serve. Eat whole or cut into halves or quarters. Peanut Butter Toast with Kiwifruit Place the bread slices into the toaster. Toast to the level of toasting you prefer. Peel and slice the kiwifruit. Cut into evenly sized slices, thick or thin. Remove the toast from the toaster. Spread the peanut butter across the toasted slices. Arrange the kiwifruit slices across each slice of peanut-buttered toast. Pile them on, be generous. Serve. This is best eaten whole as the kiwifruit tends to slice all over the place as it is, without being cut into bits as well. Peanut Butter Toast Banana Blueberry Bears Place the bread slices into the toaster. Toast to the level of toasting you prefer. Slice bananas into evenly sized slices. Wash the blueberries if you haven't already done so, and dry before using. Remove the toast from the toaster. Spread the peanut butter across the toasted slices. Try to spread roughly in the shape of a head (rounded at the base of the toast, with two ear-ish circles at the top sides of the toast). Perfection isn't expected, just a general idea of a bear's head. Arrange the fruit. This part makes the bear, so it's important to get it right:\nPlace two banana slices at the top corners of the toast. These make the ears. Place one banana slice right in the middle. This forms the bear's snout. Place two blueberries just above the middle banana slice, evenly set apart. These are the bear's eyes. Place the last blueberry in the middle of the middle banana slice.
