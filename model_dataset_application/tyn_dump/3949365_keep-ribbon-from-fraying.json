  "text":" Applying Nail Polish Find extremely sharp fabric scissors. The sharper the scissors, the better the edge of the ribbon will be. Measure the length of your ribbon. Snip the edge at a 45-degree angle, or cut it in an inverted \u201cv\u201d shape to discourage fraying. Purchase clear nail polish. Use a good quality, trusted brand that you know encourages long wear. Dip the nail polish brush into the nail polish. Wipe the brush on the top of the bottle to remove excess polish.
