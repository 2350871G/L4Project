When you're done, add it to a saucepan with the cup of coconut milk, 3 cups of water, and the tablespoon of sea salt. Bring the mixture to a boil.

Serve the rice on its own, or pair it with beef, chicken, or a vegetable mixture. Using a Rice Cooker Place the rice in a rice cooker. Place 2 cups of Thai jasmine-scented white rice in the cooker. Add the other ingredients. Add 2 cups of water, 1 cup of coconut milk, and 1 tbsp. of dry shredded coconut to the rice. Stir the ingredients together with a plastic spoon until they're thoroughly combined to distribute the coconut flavor and to keep the rice from sticking. Cover the cooker and set it to cook.
