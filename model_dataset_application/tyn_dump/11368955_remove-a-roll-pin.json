          "description":"If the roll pin has rusted or broken - or if the metal parts it\u2019s holding together are old - it may be tough to loosen. In this case, use an aerosol oil- and water-displacing spray to loosen up the pin. If the canister has a plastic tube that can be attached to the spray nozzle, use this to direct the spray directly onto the sides of the roll pin. Wait 10 minutes for the spray to seep into the metal around the pin. Aerosol oil- and water-displacing sprays are for sale at any hardware store. You can also find them at home-improvement store and large retail stores."

The tool has a curved base that\u2019s about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long. Coming out of one end is a knob attached to a threaded metal rod. Set the end of the threaded rod against the stuck pin and turn it clockwise to put pressure on the pin and loosen it. These tools are sold at hardware stores and are relatively inexpensive. They typically only cost between $10\u201320 USD."

Use a propane torch to heat up the stuck roll pin until it\u2019s red hot. The contrast of hot and cold temperatures should be enough to loosen the roll pin in its housing. This works well on handguns and other smaller metal objects. If you\u2019re working on a car, obviously it won\u2019t fit in your freezer. But, you can still use a propane torch to heat the roll pin and loosen it up."
