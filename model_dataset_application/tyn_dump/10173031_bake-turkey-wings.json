  "text":" Preparing the Turkey Wings Preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). Turn the oven on before you start your food preparation. Position your oven rack to the center of your oven. Cooking your turkey wings in the middle of the oven will allow the heat to flow around the dish and will help the wings to bake evenly. Dice the onion. Use a sharp knife to cut the onion into small-medium pieces. If you don\u2019t like onion you can skip this step and leave the onion out. Try cutting the onions under an overhead vent or microwave ventilation fan to stop your eyes stinging from the onions. Place the turkey wings and chopped onions into an ovenproof dish. Spread the turkey wings across the dish so that they aren\u2019t on top of each other. It is fine if they are touching as long they are all on a single layer. This will help the wings to cook evenly. Sprinkle the chopped onion across the dish and over the wings. Sprinkle half of the seasonings onto each side of the wings. Sprinkle half 1/2 teaspoon of seasoned salt, 1/2 teaspoon of poultry seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic onto the top side of the wings. Turn the wings over and then sprinkle the rest of the seasoning onto the underside. Mixing the seasonings together in a small bowl first will save you time when turning over the turkey wings. Pour 0.5 cups (120 mL) of water into the bottom of the oven dish. Measure 0.5 cups (120 mL) of water and pour it evenly over the dish. The water should cover the bottom of the dish. This creates a sauce for the turkey wings to marinate in while they are cooking. Cover the oven dish with aluminum foil or a lid. If the dish doesn't have a lid you can aluminum foil instead. Pull the foil over the dish and secure it by wrapping it over the sides of the dish. This keeps the turkey moist and helps the meat to cook evenly. Cooking the Turkey Wings Place the wings into the oven for 1 hour. After 1 hour the wings should be lightly browned. Check the wings at 50 minutes to make sure they aren't burning. Mix the cream of mushroom soup and water together. Mix the can of cream of mushroom soup 10.75 ounces (305 g) and 1 cup (240 mL) of water together in a small bowl. Keep stirring the mixture until the soup and water are well combined. Remove the dish from the oven and pour the mixture over the wings. Keep the oven dish level as you remove it from the oven as there will be hot juices in the bottom of the dish. Gently pour the soup and water mixture over the wings so that it evenly covers the dish.
