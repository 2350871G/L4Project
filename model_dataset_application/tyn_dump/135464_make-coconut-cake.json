Make sure your oven is set to the correct temperature, which should take around 15 minutes. This time can vary depending on your oven, so pay attention to the preheating indicator light on your oven. If you don\u2019t preheat your oven, your cake might not bake all the way, or you may have to bake it for a longer time. This can also lead to a cake that is unevenly baked. If your oven doesn\u2019t have an indicator light, use a thermometer to judge the temperature of the oven."

If you don\u2019t have extra butter or margarine, you can use a baking spray to grease your pans. Don\u2019t worry if the parchment paper won\u2019t stay in the greased pans.

Slowly increase the speed of the mixer until you reach medium-high, and then allow the butter and sugar to combine for at least 3 minutes. They should be light yellow and have a fluffy texture. You may need to use a spatula to push the ingredients down into the bowl as they mix. It\u2019s important to use soften butter since it will combine more easily with the sugar to form a creamy mixture. You can soften your butter by leaving it outside of the refrigerator for 30 minutes, or microwave it on the defrost setting for 15 seconds."
