  "text":" Making a French Ham and Cheese Sandwich Cut a baguette in half lengthwise using a serrated knife. Try to get one that is about 26 inches (66.04 centimeters) long. You can choose to include the heel, or cut it off. Spread butter on one side of the baguette and the mustard on the other. If you don't like mustard, then simply use more butter instead. Make sure that the butter is at room temperature, however; this will make it easier to spread. If you can't find any Dijon mustard, you can use regular mustard instead. For extra flavor, use salted butter. Layer the ham and cheese on the bottom half of the baguette. For extra flavor and crunch, you can add some slicked cornichons as well. Cover the sandwich with the top half of the baguette and press down on it lightly. This will \"seal\" the sandwich and help keep it together. Don't press down so hard that the crust cracks, however. Cut the sandwich into 4 to 8 equal-sized portions. If the sandwiches are not holding together, you can stick a sandwich/club frill toothpick down the center of each one. Serve the sandwiches immediately. If you won't be eating them right away, you can wrap them up tightly with plastic wrap, and store them in the fridge for the next day.

Serve the sandwich while it is still warm. You can serve it as it is, or add a side, such as chips or fries. Making a Monte Cristo Grilled Cheese Sandwich In a shallow dish, beat the egg with a fork until it is smooth, then set it aside. Season the egg with a pinch of salt and pepper, to taste.

The sandwich is ready when the cheese melts and the bread turns golden brown. Serve the sandwich while it is still hot. If you'd like, you can sprinkle some powdered sugar on top.
