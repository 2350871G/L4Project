Repeat with as many eggs as your recipe calls for (usually 2 or 3 for a typically pie topping). Reserve the yolks for later use in custard or ice cream. Use a different  egg separating technique if you prefer not to use the shell transfer method."

When your pie filling is prepared, simply spread the meringue across the top, then place it in the oven and bake it until the top of the meringue is light brown at the tips. You can make the pie look more decorative by creating mini peaks and curls. After you spread the meringue on the pie surface, use the back of a spoon to lightly touch the surface of the meringue and lift it into a small peak. Repeat in the pattern on the rest of the pie. Be sure that your oven temperature isn't too hot when you're baking meringue pie. In order for the peaks to hold, the moisture needs to evaporate gradually with relatively low heat."

Use the back of the spoon to lightly press the center of a cookie, then lift up to form a small peak. Repeat with the remaining cookies and bake them for about 10 minutes, or until they turn golden brown. You can flavor meringue cookies by stirring in cinnamon, pumpkin spice, small chocolate chips, or cocoa powder. For prettier cookies, fill an icing bag with meringue and pipe them onto the cookie sheet through a decorate tip. This way you can make ridged swirls and other patterns. To make peppermint meringues, mix a few drops of peppermint extract and red food coloring in a bowl. After piping the meringue onto the cookie sheet, use a small clean paintbrush to pain candy cane-like stripes around the ridges of the cookies before baking them."
