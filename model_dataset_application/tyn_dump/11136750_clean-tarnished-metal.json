If your item is too big to fit inside the bowl, dip a clean cloth in the solution and lay it over the tarnished area to allow it to soak in. Move the item through the solution periodically to help loosen the gunk and grime as it dissolves. Exposing metals to water for prolonged periods of time could lead to corrosion or deterioration in the long term.

If you\u2019re scrubbing your item with a sponge, make sure you use the non-abrasive side to avoid accidentally damaging it."

The combination of the soft, flexible bristles and the mildly acidic vinegar solution will be perfect for cleaning tarnish metal items without damaging them. Be sure to use a toothbrush that\u2019s either brand new or has recently been deep-cleaned. You don\u2019t want to accidentally introduce any other tarnish-causing substances to the metal.

You should be able to see the tarnish fading and the item\u2019s original luster returning within a few seconds. Re-wet your brush when it begins to dry out or clean less effectively.
