          "description":"Before you sew the pelts together, figure out how you want them to go together. Look at the pelts with the fur sides up facing up and position them next to each other on a flat surface as desired. You may arrange the pelts in a way that looks nice to you, or you may use the edges of the pelts to see which ones will fit together well. Keep in mind that pelts come in different shapes and sizes depending on the type of animal fur. For example, beaver pelts are typically cut into the shape of an oval while coyote pelts are cut with the leg and tail sections sticking out from the body section. If you are using small pelts, such as rabbit fur, then you may have lots of pelts to arrange. For example, it may take up to 50 rabbit pelts to make a small throw or lap blanket or up to 100 pelts to make a throw that is big enough for a double bed. Make sure you have a large, flat area to work in so that you can spread out your pelts. Use a large table or clear a space on the floor."

          "headline":"Turn the pelts so the skins are facing up and line up the edges.",
          "description":"You should only sew the pelts through the skins, and not through the fur. After you have finished arranging the pelts how you want them to fit together, turn the pelts so that the fur sides of the pelts are facing downward and the skins are facing up. Then, move the pelts together so that the edges of the skins are aligned."

          "description":"You may find it easier to sew the pelts together if you cut some or all of the pelt skins to create flat edges. This will make it easier to line up the edges of the skins. However, do not use scissors to cut through the pelt skins because you may end up cutting some of the fur by accident. Instead, use a rotary cutter or utility knife to cut through the skin sides of the pelts. Apply light to medium pressure to cut through the pelts and hold them steady as you cut them. You may want to measure and draw lines on the back side of the pelts first to ensure that you get accurate cuts."

          "description":"Use some small or large binder clips to connect the edges of the fur skins. Just clip them together so that about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of the skins are pressed together. This bit of skin should be on the skin side of the pelts, not on the fur side. Binder clips are great for keeping fur pelts together because they will not leave holes in the skins. Do not overlap the skins."
