Look for the end of a white or green pipe that\u2019s on the side of the tank closest to your home, and check if anything is blocking the end. If there is, then it may be the clog causing the problem. If the water level is below the inlet pipe, then the clog may be somewhere in the drain pipe between the septic tank and your home. If the water level is above the inlet but there isn\u2019t anything blocking the end of the pipe, then the clog may be in the leach field. You may need to dig up the access lid with a shovel or use a pry bar to lift it up.Tip: Consult with your home\u2019s as-built drawings, which are blueprints drawn after your home is built, or a septic service if you can\u2019t find the access lid for your septic system."

Use a long, solid piece of wood or metal and use it to move the scum down or to the side of the inlet pipe. Continue pushing as much of the scum from around the pipe as you can so it can keep filling your tank. Always wear gloves while working in your septic tank so you don\u2019t get any bacteria or waste on your hands.

    "Feed the cutting blade of a mechanical auger into the end of the clogged pipe.",
    "A mechanical auger has a long metal cable you put into your pipes that has a rotating bit to cut through the blockage.",
    "Start from the end of the clogged pipe or at an access point for the pipe, such as a cleanout port.",
    "Place the cutting blade of the auger inside the pipe that\u2019s clogged, and push the line in about 1\u20132 feet (30\u201361 cm).",
    "You can buy a mechanical auger online or from your local hardware store.",
    "Check if a local hardware store offers equipment rentals to see if you can get an auger for a day without having to pay the full price.",
    "Put on safety glasses and work gloves before you turn on the auger.",
    "Since mechanical augers have rotating and moving parts, protect your eyes so you don\u2019t injure yourself if you lose control of the machine.",
    "Put on thick work gloves to avoid spreading bacteria or getting hurt while you handle the line.",
    "Plug the auger into the nearest electrical outlet and turn the switch to the On or Forward position.",
    "You may need an extension cord to plug in the mechanical auger.",
    "Don\u2019t run the auger without gloves or safety glasses since you could severely injure yourself.",
    "Never start the auger if you have the cutting end outside of the pipe since it will spin violently.",
    "Continue feeding the auger deeper into the pipe so it breaks apart the clog.",
    "Hold the auger\u2019s line with both hands and guide it into the pipe until you hit resistance.",
    "If the resistance feels solid, try turning the line in your hands to see if it moves further inside since it may have hit a bend in the pipe.",
    "Otherwise, push and pull the auger in short, back and forth strokes to force the blockage apart.",
    "Keep forcing the auger into the clogged section of pipe until it moves through it easily.",
    "If you remove the clog, water will start flowing through the pipe again while you have the auger inside it.",
    "Mechanical augers come in different lengths, so if you aren\u2019t able to reach the clog with the one you\u2019re using, try renting the next longest size.Tip: Always hold the auger\u2019s line with at least 1 hand while it\u2019s running so it doesn\u2019t spin or rotate as you try to feed it.",
    "Turn the auger off before pulling it out of the pipe.",
    "Flip the power switch on the auger to the Off or Reverse setting so you can remove it without difficulty.",
    "Guide the auger\u2019s line back into the container with both hands, and pull it slowly back through the pipe.",
    "Carefully pull the end of the auger out of the pipe and clean off any debris or waste that\u2019s stuck on the end with a hose or paper towel.",
    "Don\u2019t take the auger out of the pipe while it\u2019s still running since it could hurt you.",
    "Avoid touching the auger\u2019s line with bare hands since it was just in a pipe that contains waste and harmful bacteria.",
    "Clean the tools with a solution of 5 parts water and 1 part bleach.",
    "Pour 1 part chlorine bleach and 5 parts clean water into a bucket and stir the solution together.",
    "Wipe the end of the auger with a cleaning rag to kill any bacteria left on the surface so you don't contaminate anything else.",
    "Pour the solution into your septic tank when you're finished.",
    "Don't dump the cleaning solution in another drain since it has harmful pathogens from your septic tank.",
    "Put the lid back on your septic tank.",
    "Grab the lid by the handles or sides and lift it off of the ground.",
    "Carefully lower the lid back on top of the hole leading into your septic tank so it's completely covered.",
    "Make sure the lid doesn't slide or shift, or else it could come off of the septic tank easily.",
    "Preventing Clogs Avoid putting anything in your drains besides water and natural waste.",
    "Septic tanks are only meant to handle water, human waste, and toilet paper, so other items can cause the entire system to clog.",
    "Throw away paper towels, wet wipes, food scraps, or other solid material in with the regular trash so it can\u2019t block the pipes.",
    "Let other people in your home know what they can and cannot rinse down the drains so they don\u2019t clog the pipes.",
    "Avoid using rinsing any harsh chemical cleaners down your drains since they could kill the natural bacteria in your septic tank that normally breaks down solid waste.",
    "Never rinse grease down your drains since it can solidify in your pipes and form clogs that are hard to remove.Tip: You do not need to add any additional natural enzymes or bacteria to your septic tank for breaking down solid waste.",
    "Any added enzymes won\u2019t be as effective as the ones that naturally occur in the tank.",
    "Use less water in your home so the septic system can drain properly.",
    "Don\u2019t run water in your home unless you have to, or else you could cause the tank to fill up too quickly.",
    "Try to limit how much water you use when you\u2019re bathing or cleaning so you only have as much as you need.",
    "If you have any old or leaking fixtures, repair them or opt for more efficient systems, such as toilets that flush less water or faucets with aerators attached to them.",
    "Limiting your water use will also help you save money on your utility bill.",
    "Don\u2019t drive or plant over the area with your septic tank.",
    "Heavy weight can cause pipes leading from your septic tank to collapse or break, so try to avoid using a vehicle over the area if you can.",
    "Plant roots can also grow into the pipes or septic tank and cause them to easily clog.",
    "If you want trees or plants, keep them at least 20\u201330 feet (6.1\u20139.1 m) away from your septic system so the roots aren\u2019t able to grow inside.",
    "You can always cut roots out of your pipes with a mechanical auger, but they will grow back if left untreated.",
    "Root barriers from gardening stores kill roots on contact and can protect your septic system from overgrowth.",
    "Dig a trench that\u2019s  2 feet (61 cm) deep around your septic system so it\u2019s 3 feet (91 cm) away from any pipes.",
    "Place the root barrier vertically in the trench before filling the dirt back in.",
    "Clean the effluent filter on the outlet pipe to improve drainage.",
    "The effluent filter is a plastic cylinder in your septic tank\u2019s outlet pipe that prevents solid waste from escaping.",
    "Open the access lid on the tank that\u2019s furthest from your home.",
    "Look inside for a vertical white or green pipe that\u2019s holding the filter and sticking out from the top layer of scum.",
    "Pull the filter straight out from the vertical pipe and rinse the waste back into the tank with a hose.",
    "Push the filter back into the pipe again so it continues blocking waste.",
    "Not every septic system will have an effluent filter.",
    "Check your filter any time you have your tank pumped or inspected so it\u2019s less likely to clog.",
    "Have your septic tank inspected by a professional every 3 years.",
    "Septic tanks usually take about 3\u20135 years to fill, but it may vary depending on the size or amount of water you use.",
    "Contact a professional service to check the water levels and pipes for your system to see if you need to make any changes.",
    "If the service has any concerns, address them as soon as possible so you don\u2019t have a faulty septic system."
