If you'd like to add any extra vegetables (such as leeks, fennel, tomatoes, mushrooms, or parsnips) wash and chop them too. You don't need to peel the vegetables first. If you'd like to make stock using vegetable peelings and scraps, substitute 4 to 6 cups (907 to 1.4 kg) of scraps for the chopped vegetables."

Pour in enough water to cover the vegetables by a few inches (5 cm). The less water you use, the stronger the stock will be. More water will give you a lighter stock."

Keep the lid off of the pot so some of the water evaporates and concentrates the flavor of the stock. The color of the water should darken a little depending on the vegetables you're using."

Hold the stockpot with both hands and slowly pour the stock through the strainer into the bowl in the sink. If you'd like to filter the stock, you can line the bowl with cheese cloth or coffee filters."

You can store the stock in freezer jars or bags or refrigerate stock in airtight containers. Freeze the stock for up to 3 months or refrigerate it for up to one week. If you want to freeze small portions, consider filling an ice cube tray with stock. Transfer the cubes of stock to a freezer bag and use the cubes whenever you need just a few tablespoons (ml) of stock."
