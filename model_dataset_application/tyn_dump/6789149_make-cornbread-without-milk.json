  "text":" Preparing Open your bag/box of Corn Muffin Mix and pour it into one of your bowls. When pouring, pour slowly and gently so the powder does not explode into your face or counter top. Add any and all other dry ingredients you would like to add to your cornbread such as sugar, cinnamon, flour, salt, pepper, and so on. The corn muffin mix most likely already contains salt and flour in the pre-made ingredients. When adding extra salt and/or flour, you may not want to add too much. Crack 1 egg into an empty mixing bowl. You can decide of course whether or not you will be using the egg whites, yolk, or the entire egg. Add 1/3 cup of mayonnaise to the egg bowl. As shocking as it may seem, mayonnaise is a perfect substitute for milk when making cornbread for the lactose intolerant. You won't really notice the difference in taste in the cornbread; it's mainly for holding your cornbread together so it doesn't crumble apart. It's a myth that all mayonnaise contains milk/aged milk, but some brands will have milk added to it. Pay close attention to the ingredients listed on the mayonnaise bottle. Stir! Pull out your whisk and/or electric mixer and stir the wet ingredients for about 10-20 seconds. If your mix ends up too thick, simply add a tablespoon of water and stir it in. Repeat this until your mix is at your desired thickness/thinness. Pour your wet ingredients into your mixing bowl full of dry ingredients and stir thoroughly until the ingredients are evenly mixed Be cautious not to over-whip your cornbread mix; stirring for too long will cause this. Baking Leave your cornbread mix out at room temperature for about 2 minutes or so to let the ingredients settle. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F while your cornbread mix sits out. Spray your cooking pan with cooking spray so your cornbread will not stick to the sides. Make sure that the pan you are using is \"Deep Dish\" as if you were about to bake a layer of cake. Using thin cookie sheets may result in your cornbread cooking entirely too fast thus breaking apart, and then you'll have burnt cornbread cookie-looking things. That doesn't sound tasty, right? Slowly stir your cornbread mix a final time and pour it slowly into your cooking pan. Spread out the cornbread mix evenly in your pan so all sides will cook evenly.
