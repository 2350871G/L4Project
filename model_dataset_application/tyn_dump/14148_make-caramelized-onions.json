Then lay the flat sides of the onions against the board and use a sharp knife to carefully cut the onion into \u20444 to \u20448 inch (0.64 to 0.32 cm) thick slices. Take care not to cut through the root end so the onion stays together as you cut. Once you've finished slicing across the onion, trim off the root end. Use your favorite type of onion.

Once you've added all of the sliced onions, stir in a pinch of kosher salt.Did You Know? Although you can roast the prepared onions on a baking sheet, you'll still need to stir them frequently. They're also more likely to dry out and burn around the edges. If you dump all of the sliced onions into the skillet at once, it will be difficult to stir and the onions on the bottom will cook faster than the ones on top. If you're only caramelizing 1 onion, you can probably put all of the slices into the skillet at once."
