          "description":"Run the pumice stone under tap water to get the outside a little bit soaked. A pumice stone is naturally abrasive and porous, so it should absorb water pretty quickly. Just use regular tap water and don't apply any special cleaning solutions to the stone. Make sure your toilet bowl is clean before you start removing marks so you don\u2019t spread any germs or bacteria. Keep the pumice stone wet at all times to maximize its abrasive cleaning properties. If the stone is too dry, it could scratch the porcelain. If you don't have a pumice stone, using a microfiber scouring and cleaning sponge, such as a Magic Eraser, is a viable alternative."

Metal marks do not break through the outer porcelain layer and are more like pencil marks on paper than they are deep cuts. You should be able to simply scrub it away within a few moments. Don't apply much pressure at all to the pumice stone or you could risk rubbing away the finish on the porcelain. The pumice stone will leave a brownish residue as you scrub, which is not permanent and can be removed by running water over it."

If there are marks left, simply go back over them and apply a little bit more pressure to lift them off. Big, black marks may require a little more elbow grease, but be careful not to press too hard or you could break the pumice stone or damage the finish on the porcelain."

You may need several sponges to get the remaining water out, so consider buying a multipack of large car washing sponges. You can also take this opportunity to clean out the bowl with soap if it is especially dirty, but you will need to simulate flushing again with a bucket of water before you continue with the cleaning process. Try sprinkling baking soda on the marks before spritzing them with vinegar. Use a soft cleaning rag to work the marks out."
