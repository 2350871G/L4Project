Making Clear Borscht Fill a large pot with up to 12 cups (2.8 liters) of water. If your pot cannot hold that much, fill it up as much as you can. Keep in mind that your soup will be more concentrated and that you may have to scale back on some of the seasonings. Prepare the vegetables. Even though you will be serving the soup clear, it still needs to have some flavor to it. Because you will be straining everything out of the soup later on, it is best to leave the vegetables whole or in large chunks.

Add the vegetables, meaty bones, herbs, and spices into the pot, then bring the water to a boil over medium heat.

Scoop out any foam, then simmer the soup over low heat for about 2 hours. You are ready for the next step when the meat falls off the bones and the vegetables turn soft. Strain the borscht into another pot. Place a colander or strainer over a new pot, then pour the borscht through it. Press the ingredients against the mesh with the back of a spoon or rubber spatula to strain out any excess liquid. At this point, you can discard the meat and vegetables or save them for another recipe. Don't worry if some of the dried marjoram gets into the strained soup. Give the borscht a taste. If it is too watery and flavorless, let it boil over medium heat for 30 minutes, or until the flavor intensifies. If it is too flavorful, add more water. Stir in the lemon juice, season it with salt and pepper, then taste it. The ideal taste should be sour and somewhat garlicky, with beet-y sweet undertones. At this point, you can add in more seasonings, such as salt, pepper, lemon juice, or dried marjoram. You can also add a few more garlic gloves, then simmer the soup for another 1 to 2 minutes.
