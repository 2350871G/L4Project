If you are making your own pillowcase, add about 1 in (2.5 cm) to each measurement to compensate for the space used when sewing the fabric together. You can easily make smaller or larger pillows.

          "description":"Buckwheat pillows are heavier than regular pillows, so you need to choose your fabric carefully. Avoid fabric that feels thin and weak. The last thing you want is to wake up with buckwheat hulls all over your bed. Also, choose a fabric made without pesticides or other chemicals to keep your pillows 100% organic. A medium-weight fabric is a good choice for standard-size pillows. Aim for fabric about 5 to 7 oz (140 to 200 g) per 1 yd (0.91 m). For smaller \u201cJapanese-style\u201d pillows, the fabric can be thinner because you won\u2019t need to add as much filling. Cotton can be organic and is a good choice for soft pillowcases. Silk and linen are often softer than cotton but more expensive. Hemp and bamboo are a few organic choices for sturdier pillowcases."

If the zipper breaks, you could end up with a buckwheat hull mess. While you can go without a zipper, including a zipper on your pillow is ideal. The zipper allows you wash the pillow cover without getting the buckwheat wet."

Make sure you get buckwheat hulls, which look like nut shells, instead of buckwheat flour or another product. Standard-size pillows hold up to 9 lb (4.1 kg) of buckwheat, so you can adjust the amount you use. Using more buckwheat leads to a fuller pillow. Use less for smaller pillows."
