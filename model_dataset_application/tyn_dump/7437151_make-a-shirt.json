Choose a pattern that will allow you to sew the type of shirt you want. You can make a T-shirt with any type of neckline you want. For example, you could opt for a scoop neck, v-neck, or round collar. The sleeves can be as long or as short as you want them to be, such as cap-sleeves, elbow-length sleeves, \u00be length sleeves, or wrist-length sleeves. Choose the level of fitting you want for your shirt, such as loose-fitting, slightly fitted, or tight-fitting. You can also find shirt patterns for unisex, men's, and women's styles."

          "description":"Fold an existing shirt in half lengthwise and trace the outline of the shirt about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) away (for seam allowance) from the edges all the way around it. Fold the sleeves under to get them out of the way. Then, trace around the entire body of the shirt including the area where the sleeve and shirt connect. Then, unfold the sleeve and trace around the edges of the sleeve separately to make a sleeve pattern. Keep in mind that the tracing the neckline might be a bit harder since it will need to be deeper in the front than in the back. Make sure to use a shirt in the style and size that you want your shirt to be."

Keep in mind that a fabric with some stretch will help to ensure that your shirt fits comfortably, especially around the arms. Some common types of T-shirt fabric include:\nModal. Soft, stretchy, and slinky manmade material that drapes well. Jersey. Stretchy and comfortable synthetic or cotton knit. Burnout. Cotton that has been chemically treated for a patchy, sheer look. Combed cotton. Soft, strong T-shirt material. Rayon. A breathable, silky blend of cotton, woody plants, and trees. Linen. Textured and cool flax fabric."

Then, fold it in half so that the edges are aligned on all sides. Smooth out the fabric so that there are no bumps. A table or desk works well as a work surface, but you can also lay your fabric on a clean area of the floor.

Place the pattern pieces on the folded fabric so that the edges of the pattern pieces are within the borders of the fabric. Then, place a pin along the edges of the pattern every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm). Make sure that each of the pins goes all the way through the pattern piece and fabric layers. You will likely need to pin the pattern along the fold of your fabric. Check the pattern for the word \u201cfold\u201d with arrows indicating which edge goes along the fold.

Make the cuts right along the edges to get the best results. Do your best to make clean cuts through the fabric without any jagged edges. Remember that the neckline on the front and back of the pattern will be slightly different. The neckline will be higher in back and lower in the front. You will need to cut out 2 pieces for the front and back of the shirt, and 2 pieces for each of the sleeves. Check to see if any additional pieces are required for your pattern, such as material for the neckline or other types of details."

For a simple hem, fold the edges of the fabric over by 0.5 in (1.3 cm) and sew a straight or zigzag stitch about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the folded edge to secure the hem. Some types of material will not require a hem, such as jersey. The fabric will curl up slightly at the edges if left unhemmed. You can also do a cut neckline, which is when you cut around the edges as desired and then leave the neckline unhemmed. To sew a basic neckline, you will need to cut out a 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide piece of fabric in the shape of your neckline. Then, pin the fabric to the neckline with the right sides of the fabric facing the right side of the shirt. Sew a straight stitch 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the raw edges of the neckline. Then, turn the fabric into the shirt and sew another seam 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the folded edge. This will secure your neckline. You may need to sew the front of the neckline separate from the back."

    "Choose the level of fitting you want for your shirt, such as loose-fitting, slightly fitted, or tight-fitting.",
    "You can also find shirt patterns for unisex, men's, and women's styles.",

    "Jersey is the most commonly used fabric for T-shirts and other types of casual shirts, but you can go with any type of fabric you like for your shirt.",
    "Keep in mind that a fabric with some stretch will help to ensure that your shirt fits comfortably, especially around the arms.",

    "Soft, stretchy, and slinky manmade material that drapes well.",
    "Jersey.",
    "Stretchy and comfortable synthetic or cotton knit.",
    "Burnout.",
    "Cotton that has been chemically treated for a patchy, sheer look.",
    "Combed cotton.",
    "Soft, strong T-shirt material.",
    "Rayon.",
    "A breathable, silky blend of cotton, woody plants, and trees.",
    "Linen.",
    "Textured and cool flax fabric.",
    "Lay out your fabric and fold it in half.",
    "Most patterns call for the fabric to be folded before you cut it and the pattern will go along the fold.",
    "Lay your fabric out on a flat, clean surface.",
    "Then, fold it in half so that the edges are aligned on all sides.",
    "Smooth out the fabric so that there are no bumps.",
    "A table or desk works well as a work surface, but you can also lay your fabric on a clean area of the floor.",
    "It will be better if you can lay the fabric out on a hard floor than a plush carpet since this will make it easier to flatten the fabric.",
    "Pin the pattern pieces to the folded fabric.",
    "Consult the pattern\u2019s instructions for how and where to pin the pattern onto the fabric.",
    "If you created your own pattern, place the edge of the pattern that was along the fold in your shirt along the fold in your fabric.",

    "Then, place a pin along the edges of the pattern every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm).",

    "Do your best to make clean cuts through the fabric without any jagged edges.",
    "Remember that the neckline on the front and back of the pattern will be slightly different.",
    "The neckline will be higher in back and lower in the front.",
    "You will need to cut out 2 pieces for the front and back of the shirt, and 2 pieces for each of the sleeves.",
    "Check to see if any additional pieces are required for your pattern, such as material for the neckline or other types of details.",
    "Pin the shirt pieces at the shoulders with the right sides together.",
    "Take the front (lower neckline) and back (higher neckline) pieces of your shirt and lay 1 piece out flat with the right side facing up.",
    "Then, lay the other piece over that piece with the right side facing down.",
    "Line up the edges of the 2 pieces and then insert a few pins along each of the shoulders to keep them aligned.",
    "Insert the pins so that they are perpendicular to the top of the shoulder.",
    "Use the straight or zigzag stitch setting to sew along the shoulders.",

    "Repeat for the other sleeve.",
    "Sew along the pinned edges to secure each of the sleeves.",
    "Sew a straight or zigzag stitch about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the pinned areas.",
    "Sew from 1 end of each sleeve piece to the other end of the area where the sleeve is pinned to the shirt.",
    "Repeat this for both sleeves.",
    "Do not sew over the pins.",
    "Remove them before you sew over each area.",
    "Align the sides of the shirt and pin along the armpits and sides.",
    "Fold the shirt material back over so that the right sides of the shirt are facing each other again.",
    "Then, insert a pin every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) along the sides of the shirt and the undersides of the sleeves.",
    "Place the pins about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the raw edges of the shirt.",

    "Hem the sleeves, neckline, and bottom of the shirt.",
    "If you are using a pattern, follow your pattern\u2019s instructions for hemming the sleeves, neckline, and bottom of the shirt.",
    "For a simple hem, fold the edges of the fabric over by 0.5 in (1.3 cm) and sew a straight or zigzag stitch about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the folded edge to secure the hem.",
    "Some types of material will not require a hem, such as jersey.",
    "The fabric will curl up slightly at the edges if left unhemmed.",
    "You can also do a cut neckline, which is when you cut around the edges as desired and then leave the neckline unhemmed.",
    "To sew a basic neckline, you will need to cut out a 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide piece of fabric in the shape of your neckline.",
    "Then, pin the fabric to the neckline with the right sides of the fabric facing the right side of the shirt.",
    "Sew a straight stitch 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the raw edges of the neckline.",
    "Then, turn the fabric into the shirt and sew another seam 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the folded edge.",
    "This will secure your neckline.",
    "You may need to sew the front of the neckline separate from the back.",
