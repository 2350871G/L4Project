      "description":"It\u2019s easy for your electronics to collect dust and debris over time, particularly with items that are stationary. Too much dust may even cause problems with your sound and picture quality. When cleaning, avoid using a paper towel as it may scratch your equipment. Instead, use a microfiber cloth for best results. Keep cotton swabs or a small art brush handy for reaching small spaces. Another alternative is to use a can of compressed air to dislodge dust and dirt from small areas like keyboards."

      "headline":"Spray cleaning solution on cloth instead of directly on to gadgets.",
      "description":"Never directly spray cleaning agents on your electronics. Gadgets have various entry points and ventilation holes that might get damaged if you spray directly on the equipment. Spray your cleaning cloth first and then wipe the item down."

      "headline":"Seal the surface.",
      "description":"One of the best things you can do for electronic products with a screen is seal the display surface. Products like Nanotol for electronics by CeNano protect your display surface and provide long-lasting protection. The invisible layer will protect your devices from scratches and help them remain clean longer. You will continue to get full picture quality on your screen and it will be protected from fingerprints and dust."
