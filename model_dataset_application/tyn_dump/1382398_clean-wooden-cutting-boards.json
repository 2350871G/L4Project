          "description":"Because wooden cutting boards can\u2019t be run through the dishwasher, many sources recommend not using them for high-risk foods. Whether you choose to use all-wooden, or a combination of wooden and plastic, cutting boards in your kitchen, it\u2019s important to use different cutting boards for different foods. A plastic or well-seasoned wooden cutting board should be used for high-risk foods, including raw meat, poultry, seafood, and tofu. A separate cutting board should be used for breads, cooked meats, cheese, fermented soy (like tempeh) and washed fruits and vegetables. Both boards should be cleaned after use, and it\u2019s important not to mix them up. Otherwise, you run the risk of cross-contamination."

This is especially helpful if you\u2019ve noticed your board getting a little smelly or stained. If you notice your cutting board is clinging on to the scents of strong foods, vinegar can help! Soak a paper towel in white vinegar, then wipe it across the surface of the cutting board. This will neutralize the odors without making the wood smell like vinegar in the long term. Another time-honored trick is sprinkling salt over the cutting board\u2019s surface while it\u2019s still wet. The salt draws out moisture trapped in the board\u2019s cracks, along with any bacteria that might be hiding. Stains can be dealt with using science-fair volcano ingredients, too. Try sprinkling baking soda over the discolored area, then scrub the baking soda into the wood using half a lemon. Afterwards, wash and dry the board."
