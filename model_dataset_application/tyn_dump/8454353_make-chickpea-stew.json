Sprinkle the chicken with kosher salt and cook the chicken for 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the chicken once, so both sides turn golden brown. Use tongs to transfer the chicken to a plate. You can use skin-on chicken thighs, but the stew may be a little greasy. You'll also need to be careful of the chicken sputtering as it browns."
