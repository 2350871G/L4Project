          "description":"If you are hanging a slab door in a new doorframe, or in an existing doorframe but you don\u2019t have the original door, use measuring tape to measure the size of the doorframe opening. Place the end of the measuring tape in the top corner of the doorframe opening and pull down. Stop the measuring tape \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) above the ground to leave a clearance under the door. Then, measure the inside width of the doorframe opening, leaving a \u204416 inch (0.16 cm) clearance on either side. Use these measurements to mark the size of the doorframe opening on the slab door with a pencil. If your floor is carpeted, leave a \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) clearance at the bottom of the door instead of a \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) clearance. This will allow more room for the door to swing open without getting caught on the carpet. When marking your measurements on the slab door with a pencil, use a ruler to make sure that you draw a straight line. This will allow you to make a clean, even cut when you plane or cut it down with a circular saw."

To do this, place both doors next to each other on the thin, long sides with the hinges on the old door facing up. Align the doors so that the tops are even, then use a clamp to hold the doors together. If the old and new slab doors are the same size, you can leave the new slab door as is.
