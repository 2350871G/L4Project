Place two sticks across the opening of your mold, one to either side of the wick. The wick should be sandwiched between the two sticks. This will hold the wick straight up while you pour the wax. Heating and Pouring the Wax Set up a double boiler. Fill a large saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water, and place it on a stove. Place a spouted melting pot inside the saucepan. You can buy spouted melting pots from the candle making section of an arts and crafts shop. If you can't find any, use a heat-safe, glass measuring cup instead.

Finishing the Candle Let the candle sit overnight. The wax may set up sooner than that, but you will need to wait for the sand to dry as well. If you pull the candle out too soon, the sand may not stick properly. Remove the candle from the sand carefully the next day. Use a spoon to loosen the sand around the candle, then carefully lift the candle out. Gently brush the excess sand off using a soft-bristled brush.
