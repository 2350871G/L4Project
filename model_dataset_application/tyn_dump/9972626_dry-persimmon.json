Make sure there\u2019s no white pith left behind, as this part can be tough to chew. The persimmons will shrink considerably during the drying process, so be careful not to trim too much usable fruit. There\u2019s no need to peel the persimmons prior to slicing them, but you can cut away any mushy or discolored flesh if you like."

          "description":"Slice the persimmon the way you would a tomato, holding the fruit steady with the fingertips of your non-cutting hand and making each cut with a smooth lever action. You should be able to get 8-10 slices out of an average-sized persimmon. Aim for an even thickness to ensure that each slice dries at the same rate. Underripe persimmons may require a little more effort to slice, but avoid sawing the fruit too much, or you could damage the delicate meat inside."

Once they\u2019re inside, set the dehydrator to a temperature around 115\u2013150 \u00b0F (46\u201366 \u00b0C). Low, constant heat will help solidify the sugary juices in the fruit without evaporating them or causing them to burn. Depending on the size of your dehydrator and the number of persimmons you\u2019re working with, it may be necessary to do your drying in batches. You also have the option of drying the slices in a conventional oven if you don\u2019t have a dehydrator. Keep in mind, however, that this method may not result in as pleasant a taste or texture due to the more intense heat."

A perfectly dried persimmon will be gummy but not too chewy, with a soft bite that melts in your mouth. If your persimmons don\u2019t look quite done, put them back in the dehydrator for 1-2 hours at a time until you\u2019re satisfied with their appearance. Do your best to avoid overdrying the slices.

Alternatively, stashing them in the refrigerator or freezer will help maximize their shelf life if you\u2019re holding onto them for a special occasion. A roomy mason jar with a sealing lid can also provide a more presentable storage solution for persimmons that you plan on keeping at room temperature.

Since they\u2019ll be well-preserved, your dried persimmon slices should last up to 6-8 months when properly stored. Hang-Drying Persimmons Naturally (\"Hoshigaki\") Start with underripe hachiya persimmons. While there are many different species of persimmons, hoshigaki is traditionally prepared using the hachiya variety. The fruits you select should be a little underripe\u2014firm to the touch, but not overly hard. They\u2019ll soften up as they sit in the sun, eventually turning spongy as the sugars break down and lend each bite a candied sweetness.

Mature persimmons naturally have a higher sugar content, which means they\u2019re more likely to over ripen when dried in the sun for long periods of time. Peel the persimmons, but leave the stem intact. Run the blade of a knife carefully around the outer edges of the fruit to remove the thin peel. Continue until you reach the woody stem, but don\u2019t cut it off. This little nub is what you\u2019ll be using to hang the persimmons and prepare them for drying. If you\u2019re prepping a lot of persimmons, it may be easier to use a veggie peeler or mandoline to do the bulk of your peeling. Insert a screw into the top of fruits that are missing their stems. Every now and then, you\u2019ll come across a persimmon with a stem that\u2019s broken or only partially formed. When this happens, reach for a small metal screw and twist it into the woody core. The screw will serve as a makeshift anchor point. You may have to use a little force to get the screw deep enough in the dense stem core to provide the stability you need. Wind a length of twine around the stem at the top of the fruit. The sturdy stem is useful for suspending whole persimmons, which can get a little heavy. After tying off the twine, test the knot to make sure it\u2019s secure. Fruits that slip out of their rigging may not dry as consistently as the others. Any kind of thread will do if you don\u2019t have any butcher\u2019s twine on hand, including shoestrings, yarn, or even flexible metal wire. Hang the persimmons in indirect sunlight. Pick out a well-lit (but not too bright) spot in front of an east- or west-facing window or somewhere on your screened-in porch.
