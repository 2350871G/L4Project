          "description":"Feed the wire that you plan on applying heat shrink wrap to into one of the holes on a wire gauge tool to see if it\u2019s a tight fit. If the wire can move around inside the hole on the tool, then try checking the next size down. Once you can feed the wire into a hole and it doesn\u2019t shift around while it\u2019s inserted, then write down the size of the gauge so you know what tubing to buy. You can buy a wire gauge tool from your local hardware store. You don\u2019t need to strip the insulation off of the wire if it already has it since the heat shrink tubing will go around it. If the wire doesn\u2019t fit in the wire gauge tool or has an irregular shape, then you can also use a ruler or tape measure to find the diameter."

          "description":"Look on the packaging to find the diameter of the tube before shrinking it as well as the shrink ratio it has, which is usually between 2:1 and 6:1. Divide the diameter of the shrink tubing by the first number in the ratio to find its shrunken diameter. Calculate which tubing will shrink to a size smaller than the diameter of your wire to ensure that it has a tight seal. For example, if the original diameter of the tubing is \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) and it has a 2:1 shrink ratio, then it will become \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) once you heat it. If it had a 3:1 ratio, then it would be \u20446 inch (0.42 cm) after you shrink it. You can buy heat shrink tubing from hardware stores or online. Get heat shrink tubing that matches the color of your wire if you want it to blend in more.Tip: Make sure the tubing has a large enough diameter so you can slide it over any wires or connections to guide it into place."

The extra length of tubing will cover the insulation on the wire around the area you\u2019re covering to ensure that it makes a tight seal and doesn\u2019t leave any wire exposed. Use a pair of scissors to cut the tubing to size. The heat shrink tubing may also shrink lengthwise by about 5-7% when you heat it, so you can add more to the length if you want to."

Move the nozzle of the heat gun back and forth along the length of tubing so it starts to shrink. Rotate the wire so you can heat all sides of the tubing evenly to make sure it shrinks to size and that there are no air bubbles inside. Continue heating the tubing until its tight against the wires underneath it. You can also rub the tubing with the side of a soldering iron to shrink it, but be careful not to heat it too much since you could damage the wires underneath or make the tubing brittle. You may hold the tubing over the open flame of a lighter, but it won\u2019t heat evenly and you may not have a perfect seal. Hair dryers may not be hot enough to make the tubing shrink, but you can try using one on the highest heat setting. The shrinking temperature for the tubing can usually be found on the packaging."
