You can practice on homemade scrap lumber blanks, then move on to pre-cut blanks with more attractive wood and \"stabilized\" treatment for a better fit. Line up the two brass tubes from your pen kit. Cut the blank a bit longer than this length. The other dimensions don't matter, as long as the blank is significantly larger than the desired pen size.

If it emerges fully, it will often \"blow out\" the whole blank, making you start again. Saw off the tip of the blank so the hole goes straight through. The most common sizes are 7mm (roughly J bit or 9/32\") and 8mm (roughly O or 5/16\"). If using imperial drill bits, you may want to test on scrap wood first to find the best fit.

Apply glue and stick each brass tube into the blank of the same length. Wear gloves to minimize cleanup. Cyanoacrylate (CA) glue and 5-minute epoxy are popular choices. If you use polyurethane glue, wait until the final stage, when you're ready to assemble. This glue foams up as it cures, which can ruin the fit.
