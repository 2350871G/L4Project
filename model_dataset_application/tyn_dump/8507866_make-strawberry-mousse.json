Chop the strawberries into pieces. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the sugar over the strawberries and let them sit for several minutes while you prepare the rest of the strawberries. Letting the strawberries sit with the sugar is known as macerating the fruit. This will help the strawberries release their liquid and make the strawberry flavor stronger."

Set these aside and get out the remaining pint of whole strawberries. Trim off the stems and slice the strawberries. Sprinkle the last 3 tablespoons of sugar over the sliced berries. If you don't have a blender or food processor, you can use a fork or potato masher to mash the strawberries."

Let them sit for a few minutes, so the liquid from the strawberries drips into the sink or bowl. Discard or save the liquid for another recipe. You want to remove the excess liquid, so the mousse sets up properly."

Use a stand or hand mixer to whisk the cream on high speed. Whip the mixture for a few minutes, so the cream becomes stiff. Try to chill the bowl and whisk attachments before you beat the cream.

Pour the gelatin into a large bowl along with the pureed strawberries. Stir them well. You can also melt the gelatin over a double boiler, if you don't want to use the microwave."
