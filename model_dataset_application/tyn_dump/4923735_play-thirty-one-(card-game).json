For example, if you end a round with a 2 of clubs, a 6 of spades, and a 10 of diamonds, you would want to choose diamonds as your suit since that would get you 10 points. If you ended a round with a 10 of clubs, a 5 of clubs, and a 10 of spades, you would want to choose clubs as your suit since you have 2 cards that are clubs and they add up to 15, which is higher than the 10 points you would get if you chose spades."

Once you\u2019ve found people to play with, have everyone sit in a circle at a table or on the floor so you\u2019re all facing each other. Deal out 3 cards face down to each player. These 3 cards will make up each player\u2019s hand. Make sure the cards are face down so that no one knows what cards everyone has. You can use a regular 52-card deck of playing cards. You don't need a special deck of cards to play Thirty One. Place the deck face down in the center and flip the top card up next to it. The remainder of the deck that\u2019s face-down in the middle of the playing area will be the draw pile. The face-up card next to it will be the discard pile. Make sure all of the players can reach the 2 piles since everyone will need to use them during the game. Give each player 3 tokens to start with.

These tokens will be used later in the game to determine which players get to stay in for another round and which ones are out.

However, if the player had a 10 and king of spades and an ace of diamonds, that would not be a blitz because the cards aren\u2019t the same suit. Playing the Rounds Start with the player to the left of the dealer. If you\u2019re not that player, wait until it\u2019s your turn to play. Play moves clockwise, and the dealer will go after everyone else has played. You don't need to wait until it's your turn to pick up the 3 cards you were dealt. You can pick them up right away and start strategizing while you wait for your turn! Draw from the deck or the discard pile on your turn. These are the 2 main options you have at the beginning of each turn. Whether you choose from the deck or the discard pile will depend on the cards in your hand and your strategy. Drawing from the discard pile is a good idea if you think the top card on the discard pile would help your hand. If you don\u2019t want the top card on the discard pile, draw the top face-down card from the deck instead. Discard 1 card at the end of your turn. You always have to discard at the end of your turn. Place the card you want to discard face up in the discard pile. You can discard any card in your hand unless it\u2019s the face-up card you just drew from the discard pile. You can\u2019t pick up a card from the discard pile and immediately discard it. Knock at the beginning of your turn if you want the round to come to an end.

In that case, if you\u2019re satisfied with your hand and you think you have a high score, you can say \u201cpass.\u201d\nKeep in mind that if you pass you won't get any more chances to draw or discard before the round is over. End the round after someone knocks and everyone has had their last turn. A round can\u2019t end until someone knocks. Once they do, the rest of the players get one more turn and then the round is over. At the end of a round, all of the players can reveal the 3 cards in their hand. Tally your scores for the round and take a token from the lowest scorer. Each player should choose their suit for that round, add up their total score, and announce it to the other players.
