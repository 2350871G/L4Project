This is not a long time, of course, but damaged apples should be eaten within a short amount of time no matter how you store them since a partially decayed apple is likely to spoil faster. If the apples are too damaged for human consumption, you could also consider throwing them out into the woods for deer or other wildlife to enjoy. Even if no wild animal is interested, as the apples decay, they will provide a food source for various insects and other organisms living in the dirt."

Laying a damp paper towel over the apples provides just enough moisture, but if you do cover the apples with a wet paper towel, you need to make sure that you do not seal them in an airtight container or drawer."

This is the ideal temperature range for apples to be stored at. Storing them in colder conditions will cause the cells to break down, leading to mushy, inedible apples, and storing them in conditions that are warmer by only 10 degrees Fahrenheit (12.2 degrees Celsius) can cause the apples to ripen twice as quickly. If you do not have temperature control settings that allow you to control the temperature by degrees, but you do have basic settings that allow you to make the refrigerator or crisper drawer colder or warmer, place a thermometer in the drawer and adjust the settings until the thermometer shows a number within the appropriate range."

Moreover, if one apple starts to rot while it is in storage, it could contaminate the other apples it touches, causing the entire bunch to spoil faster. Wrapping each apple individually prevents most of the potential damage caused when apples come into contact with each other. Separate a section of newspaper into quarters and stack those quarters together. Choose a section that only has black ink since colored ink contains poisonous heavy metals. Place one apple on top of the stack of newsprint. Bring the top sheet up and fold it around the apple, gently twisting the corners together the keep the apple wrapped. Do not twist too tightly, since you may tear the paper if you do. The objective is only to prevent the apple from coming into contact with other apples, not to keep the air out.
