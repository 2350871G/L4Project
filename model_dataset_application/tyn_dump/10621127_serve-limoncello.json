          "description":"Limoncello is best served cold. Chilling limoncello at least 1 hour in advance of drinking it brings out its flavor and makes it more refreshing in warmer weather. Limoncello can also be stored in the freezer, since it won\u2019t freeze solid. Limoncello doesn\u2019t have to be chilled. Because it has a high alcohol and sugar content, it is safe to drink at room temperature. However, chilling it is standard."

          "description":"Fill a shot glass or cordial glass to the rim with ice. Crushed ice works better than ice cubes since it covers more of the glass\u2019 surface area. Leave the ice in the glass for a few minutes, then dump it out when you\u2019re ready to pour the limoncello. Using a warm glass is fine if you don\u2019t have time to chill anything, but a cold glass helps draw out the limoncello's flavor. At the very least, mitigate a warm glass by chilling the limoncello in advance. Another way to chill a glass is by filling a bucket with ice. Place the glass upside down in the ice for up to 30 minutes. Alternatively, freeze the glass for up to 4 hours. As long as the glass is empty, it won\u2019t break. Frozen glasses stay colder for much longer than ice-filled glasses."

These elegant glasses match well with the Italian liqueur, but any regular shot glass you have available serves as an acceptable alternative. Limoncello is also served in ceramic shot glasses in some regions in Italy. Stemmed glasses are more effective at keeping limoncello cool, but they\u2019re easier to break. They also hold the same amount of liquor as any ordinary shot glass, so they\u2019re hardly necessary."

It is a great way to clean your palate after a heavy meal, but it\u2019s drinkable at any time of the day. Limoncello is typically served plain without ice. Try adding ice to it if it tastes too warm or your glass warms up. You may enjoy serving limoncello as a shot rather than at a specific time. Don't be afraid to enjoy it however you like."

Change the amount of limoncello or Prosecco as desired. For instance, include more limoncello to make the cocktail taste tart, or use a higher ratio of Prosecco to make the lemon flavor more subtle.

    "Shaking carbonated drinks can cause your shaker to explode.",
    "Strain the liquor into the martini glass.",
    "Hold a metal cocktail strainer over the shaker if it doesn\u2019t have a built-in strainer.",
    "Use your finger to keep it in place as you tip the shaker over.",
    "It will hold the ice in place as the liquid ingredients pour out.",
    "Garnish the martini glass with a lemon wheel.",
    "Cut a lemon into wheel-shaped slices.",
    "Use a paring knife to cut a small triangle out of the wheel, then rest it on the rim.",
    "It doesn\u2019t add any flavor, but it looks nice and represents the taste of good limoncello.",
    "Mixing a Limoncello and Gin Cocktail Chill a rocks glass with ice as you prepare the cocktail.",
    "Fill the glass to the brim with ice.",
    "You will end up serving the drink over ice, so adding clean ice now is a quick way to prepare the glass.",
    "Alternatively, leave the glass in the freezer for up to 4 hours to get it cold without having to worry about melting ice.",
    "If you aren\u2019t sure what a rocks glass looks like, it\u2019s the short, rounded glass often used for whiskey and similar shots.",
    "A standard rocks glass holds 6 to 8 fluid ounces (180 to 240 mL) of liquor.",
    "Muddle thyme or other herbs if desired.",
    "Place the fresh herbs in a mixing glass or cocktail shaker.",
    "Then, press a muddler against them and twist it 3 or 4 times until the herbs smell fragrant.",
    "Herbs, including thyme and basil, add unique flavors to the mixture, but they can be left out if you don\u2019t have them.",
    "Grill the thyme to further customize the drink.",
    "Heat a grill to about 500 \u00b0F (260 \u00b0C), a medium-high setting.",
    "Hold the thyme against the grill for about 15 seconds until it looks lightly charred and smells fragrant.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a muddler, use another blunt object, such as the end of a wooden spoon.",
    "Pour gin, limoncello and citrus juice into the mixer.",
    "For a standard recipe, combine about 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of your favorite gin with \u20444 fluid ounce (22 mL) of limoncello.",
    "Pour them directly into the mixing glass with the herbs if you are using any.",
    "Then, add \u20444 fluid ounce (7.4 mL) of fresh lemon juice to make the drink a little more tart, like lemonade.",
    "Adjust the ratios of liquor to suit your taste.",
    "For instance, tone down the limoncello by reducing it to \u20442 fluid ounce (15 mL) and increasing the amount of gin.",
    "Instead of lemon juice, try using lime juice to give the cocktail a broader citrus flavor.",
    "Leave the juice out if you prefer your drink to be less tart.",
    "Fill the glass with ice and mix the liquids together.",
    "If you\u2019re using a mixing glass, pick up a cocktail mixing spoon and swirl the ice in the glass.",
    "For a cocktail shaker, cap it and shake it until everything is well-mixed.",
    "Plan on serving the cocktail in a chilled glass so you have a way to pour the ingredients out immediately.",
    "The ice will melt over time, watering down the drink and ruining its flavor.",
    "Strain the liquor into a rocks glass filled with ice.",
    "Set the chilled rocks glass on a flat surface and fill it with fresh ice cubes.",
    "You will need a metal cocktail strainer.",
    "Hold the strainer over the mixing glass or shaker with your finger as you pour the gin and limoncello mixture into the glass.",
    "Some cocktail shakers have built-in strainers.",
    "The strainer looks like a small grate with holes and is located underneath the lid.",
    "You don\u2019t need to do anything special to use them.",
    "Mix 4 fluid ounces (120 mL) of club soda into the cocktail.",
    "Pour the club soda directly into the rocks glass to give the cocktail some bubbles and fizz.",
    "Use a cocktail mixing spoon to swirl the liquids until the club soda mixes in evenly with the limoncello and gin.",
    "A limoncello-gin drink, or limoncello Collins, is typically served with the club soda.",
    "If you don\u2019t have any, leave it out.",
    "The cocktail will taste a little heavier, but including ingredients like muddled herbs makes up for it.",
    "Garnish the glass with lemon wheels before serving it.",
    "Cut up a fresh lemon into slices about 1 in (2.5 cm) thick.",
    "Remove a small triangle out of a lemon slice, enough to wedge it in place on the glass.",
    "Add a few more if desired to emphasize the tart taste of the limoncello in the mixture.",
    "Use other garnishes that reflect your cocktail.",
    "For instance, add a fresh sprig of thyme if you muddled grilled thyme earlier."
