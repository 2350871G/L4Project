    "Dip a pastry brush in the egg wash and brush it evenly over the top of the pie.",
    "Then use a sharp knife to cut 6 vents across the top of the pie.",
    "Each vent should be about 3 in (7.5 cm) long so steam can escape from the filling as the pie bakes.",
    "Set the pie on a baking sheet and bake it for 75 minutes.",
    "Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet and set the pie on it.",
    "Put the pie on the baking sheet into the preheated oven and bake it until the apples are soft and the pastry is golden brown.",
    "The baking sheet will catch any drips if the filling bubbles up and over the pie as it's baking.",
    "Cool the pie for at least 1 hour before you serve it.",
    "Take the pie out of the oven and let it rest at room temperature so the filling sets up.",
    "Then slice the pie and serve it with whipped cream or ice cream.",
    "To store leftover apple pie, cover it with aluminum foil and keep it at room temperature for up to 3 days.",
    "You can also refrigerate it for up to 4 to 5 days."
