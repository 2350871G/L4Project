Test the size of your bottles by placing the small bottle upside-down, with its neck sticking into the opening on the large bottle. The small bottle should sit comfortably on top of the large one.

In fact, if you\u2019re going for a rustic look, an imperfect square may even be ideal. If you\u2019re using super glue, you can apply glue to all 4 edges before connecting them all together.

This will form the legs of the water tower, so make the angle as identical as possible for each of the long sticks. Keep the angle of the legs around 10-15 degrees.

Do the same thing with another line of glue and another Popsicle stick on the other end of the square.

You may need to trim the sticks down or remove one of the 9 sticks to match up the lengths. Use your hand to hold the Popsicle stick square together as you glue it.

    "If you\u2019re using hot glue, make sure to glue each edge separately.",
    "This will keep the glue from drying before you can connect all 4 sections together.",
    "Line up 2 larger Popsicle sticks to create 1 long, straight stick.",
    "Place the sticks on a flat surface with their ends touching.",
    "Take another Popsicle stick of the same size and apply glue to the entire surface on 1 side, lengthwise.",
    "Place the glued side directly in the middle of the 2 sticks that are lined up.",
    "The third stick does not have to be exactly in the middle of the other 2 sticks, but it should be close enough that it holds the other 2 sticks together evenly.",
    "Repeat this process 3 more times.",
    "Follow the same process as before by lining up 2 of the larger Popsicle sticks and gluing a third stick on top of them.",
    "Do this 3 more times until you have 4 identical long sections that are each made out of 3 glued Popsicle sticks.",
    "Connect the end of 1 of the long sticks to the inside corner of the square frame.",
    "Apply glue to the inside edge of the long stick and place it at a slight outward angle, with the third stick that is holding the other 2 sticks together facing inward.",
    "Glue the long stick so that it does not poke out above the frame once connected.",
    "Do the same thing with the other 3 long sections you created in the other 3 corners of the frame.",
    "This will form the legs of the water tower, so make the angle as identical as possible for each of the long sticks.",
    "Keep the angle of the legs around 10-15 degrees.",
    "If the angle is too steep, the water tower will be too short.",
    "If it is too steep, it will probably topple over.",
    "Use another Popsicle stick to connect 2 of the legs together.",
    "Apply glue to each inside edge of the stick.",
    "Place the edges of the Popsicle stick on top of the lines where the 2 Popsicle sticks used to create the legs meet.",
    "Do the same thing with 3 other sticks until you have a stick connecting the legs on all 4 sides.",
    "You will need to spread the legs apart so that the sticks do not hang outside the edge of the leg.",
    "Keep the connecting sticks as level as possible.",
    "You want it to appear as if there is a single, continuous stick wrapping around the legs of the tower, not 4 separate small sticks.",
    "Lay 9 Popsicle sticks side-by-side on a flat surface.",
    "Line them up along their long edges so the sticks make a square when lined up.",
    "Apply a line of glue on the edge of the square down the length of all 9 Popsicle sticks.",
    "Place another Popsicle stick along the same direction as the glue line so that it holds all 9 sticks together.",
    "Do the same thing with another line of glue and another Popsicle stick on the other end of the square.",
    "The Popsicle sticks used to hold the other 9 sticks together should be the same length as the square, so that they match up perfectly with both corners and do not hang over the edge.",
    "You may need to trim the sticks down or remove one of the 9 sticks to match up the lengths.",
    "Use your hand to hold the Popsicle stick square together as you glue it.",
    "Place your hand flat on top of all 9 sticks, and do your best to keep them all together with no gaps between them.",
    "Apply glue to the top edge of the square frame you made earlier.",
    "Place the square platform you just created on top of the frame, connecting it to the base structure you already made.",
    "Glue the platform so that the Popsicle sticks used to connect the other sticks together are facing downward.",
    "You can also glue each individual Popsicle stick directly onto the square frame you made earlier.",
    "It will take longer, but you may be able to line the sticks up better this way.",
    "Cut the rim off of a small paper Dixie cup.",
    "Cut around the top of the open side to remove the outer rim.",
    "Try to keep the line as straight as possible, since this will form the foundation for the water container part of your water tower.",
    "Glue the remaining Popsicle sticks to the outside of the Dixie cup.",
    "Place glue along one of the wide edges of a Popsicle stick.",
    "Line up the top edge of the stick with the bottom edge of the cup and glue it down.",
    "Repeat this process around the entire circumference of the cup until it is completely covered.",
    "When gluing the sticks onto the cup, fan them out from one another to create a more realistic look.",
    "When you place the second stick on the cup, keep the edge of the stick as close to the edge of the cup as possible, but fan out the end that is jutting over the edge of the cup by about 5 degrees so that a small sliver of the cup can be seen underneath.",
    "Roughly half of the length of each Popsicle stick will be glued to the Dixie cup, while the other half will be jutting out over the rim of the cup.",
    "Cover the gaps in the Popsicle sticks by gluing another layer on top.",
    "If you fanned out the sticks to create a more realistic look, go back over the cup with additional Popsicle sticks.",
    "Glue the sticks directly in the middle of two sticks on the bottom layer so that the second layer covers up any slivers of cup that may be showing.",
    "Keep the edges lined up with the bottom edge of the cup as best you can.",
    "Place the Dixie cup in the middle of the platform with the open side up.",
    "Apply glue around the entire circumference of the bottom of the cup.",
    "Then, stick it down as close to the middle of the platform as possible.",
    "Use a lot of glue to attach the Dixie cup so that it doesn\u2019t fall off if it\u2019s bumped.",
    "Optionally, you can wrap a string around the bottom and middle of the Dixie cup to give it a Western look.",
    "Wrap the string several times for better results.",
    "Use 2 wooden dowels to create a ladder.",
    "Place 2 wooden dowels roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart on a flat surface.",
    "Line them up so they are parallel with the pointy side on top.",
    "Use small sections of Popsicle sticks roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) long to create the steps.",
    "Apply glue to both ends of 1 side of the stick, then place it horizontally between the dowels so that it connects them together.",
    "Do this all the way up the 2 dowels, roughly 7 times, until about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the pointy side of the dowels is left sticking out.",
    "Lean the ladder against the water tower at an angle and secure it with glue.",
    "Glue another small section of Popsicle stick horizontally across the very tips of the dowels, above and on the opposite side of the steps.",
    "Lean it up against the side of your water tower with the tips facing up.",
    "Place glue on the backside of the tips of the dowel and press down to attach it."
