Use a grill brush or plastic scraper to remove initial layers of residue by scrubbing vertically along the cooking grid in aggressive up-and-down strokes. Let the grill cool.Tip: You can use a specialized grill cleaning chemical if you\u2019d like, but even if you clean your grill thoroughly it can leave behind a residue that gets into your food. It will also remove a lot of the natural seasoning and oil that\u2019s soaked into your grates, which help make food tastier and give it the smoky flavor associated with grilling. Don\u2019t touch the grill directly until you\u2019ve let it cool for 20-30 minutes after you\u2019ve cleaned it. The cooking grid, or grate, is the metal surface where you place your food when you\u2019re grilling."
