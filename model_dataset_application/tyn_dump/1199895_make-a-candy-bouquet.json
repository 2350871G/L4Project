  "text":" Lollipop Bouquet Choose a container for your candy bouquet. Be creative and personalize the container to fit the person you're making the bouquet for. A sand pail makes a great container for a child's bouquet. Use a parfait cup, coffee cup, or a soup mug for a friend, co-worker or teacher; a vintage tin for an antique collector; a small tackle box for an angler; a clay or plastic flower pot for a gardener or a popcorn bucket for a movie buff.

Candy Bar Bouquet Use a glue gun to glue boxes of candy around each edge of a Styrofoam block.

Using boxes of candy like Hot Tamales or the boxed M&Ms or Sno-Caps you can find at the movies are perfect for covering the Styrofoam block.

Glue some tissue paper around the top edge of the block so that all of the Styrofoam is covered and the candy block has a more bouquet-like feel. Cookie Candy Bouquet Glue a Styrofoam bottom into a large mug. Pick a mug that is festive for the occasion, whether it's around Christmas, Thanksgiving, or Valentine's Day. Trace the bottom of the mug over a piece of thick Styrofoam and cut the Styrofoam and place it snugly into the bottom of the mug. You can even try to glue the Styrofoam into the bottom of the mug, but then you -- or the person you're giving it to -- won't be able to use it once all the candy is eaten. Bake a tray of cookies on popsicle sticks. Make the dough for chocolate chip, gingerbread, oatmeal raisin, or any other cookies that you like. Before you put them into the oven, cut a small hole in the bottom of the cookies and insert a wooden popsicle stick in each one. It's a good idea to bake a few extra cookies in case some of them break or don't stay on the popsicle stick. Give the cookies at least 10-15 minutes to cool off and harden before you try placing them in the bouquet. Stick the popsicle sticks with cookies on them into the Styrofoam at the bottom of the mug. Spread the cookies out evenly so they stick out neatly above the mug. They can stick out at different angles and heights, as long as the bouquet looks visually appealing. Fill the mug with candy and brown tissue paper. Place wrapped candy that goes well with the cookies, such as Reese's peanut butter cups or individually-wrapped Milky Ways, into the bottom of the mug, and place some brown tissue paper on top to cover the candy and Styrofoam.",
