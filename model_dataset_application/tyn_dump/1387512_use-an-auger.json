A hand auger can be operated by 1 or 2 people. This is best if you only have 1 or 2 holes to dig, because it takes a lot of work to turn the handle. A power auger uses a gasoline engine to turn the auger, but it can be dangerous if it runs into a rock or other obstruction. The auger will stop suddenly, which can cause the top to jerk, knocking you off your feet or even breaking your arm. A wheeled auger is a power auger mounted on a wheeled frame, so there is less chance you'll be injured if it stops. A tractor auger is safest because you operate it from the tractor seat.
