If you have a basement or live in a cold climate, check near your water heater where the pipes enter your home. If you don\u2019t have a basement or live in a warm climate, the valve may be connected to a pipe by your faucet outside. Rotate the valve so it\u2019s perpendicular to the pipe to prevent water from entering it. If you pipe has a circular valve, rotate it clockwise until it doesn\u2019t go any further to turn off the water. You will not be able to use water in the rest of your home while the supply is turned off.Tip: If you still can\u2019t locate the valve that controls your water supply, you may need to turn off the supply from an underground utility box outside your home. Look around your yard for a black or gray plastic cover that\u2019s level with the ground and lift it up to expose the valve.

    "Be careful not to overtighten the faucet since it could cause the pipe to break or leak when you run water.",
    "Turn on your water supply to test the new faucet.",
    "Go back to your main water supply and open the valve again so water can go through your pipes.",
    "Once the water\u2019s on, turn the valve on your faucet on so water starts flowing through it.",
    "If the water comes through the faucet without leaks, then it\u2019s working and ready to use.",
    "If the faucet is leaking where it connects to the pipe, turn off the water supply again and try tightening the faucet more.",
    "If it still doesn\u2019t work, then remove the faucet and check the tape on around the threading to make sure it hasn\u2019t come undone.",
    "Replacing a Frost-Free Faucet Turn off the main water supply for your home.",
    "Locate the main water supply, which is usually near where the pipes enter your home from outside.",
    "Rotate the valve until it\u2019s perpendicular to the pipe so the water stops running through your home.",
    "If you don\u2019t see a supply valve in your basement, look in your yard for a black or gray plastic cover that\u2019s level with the ground.",
    "Remove the cover and locate the rectangular valve that controls your water.",
    "Turn the valve so it\u2019s perpendicular to the pipe.",
    "If the main water supply has a circular valve, then rotate it clockwise to turn off the water.",
    "If you still can\u2019t find your water supply valve, contact your utility company to turn off the water in your home for you.",
    "Some outdoor faucets have a valve on the pipe leading to them so you can close their water supply without turning it off in the rest of your home.",
    "If the outdoor faucet doesn\u2019t have a separate valve, then you won\u2019t be able to use the water in the rest of your home while you\u2019re working.",
    "Open the outdoor faucet to drain the water out.",
    "Rotate the valve on your faucet until it\u2019s open and water flows out of it freely.",
    "Keep the valve open until all of the water drains out so you don\u2019t have to worry about anything leaking during your repairs.",
    "Once the water stops, you can leave the valve open or close it again.",
    "Don\u2019t try to remove a faucet without draining the pipe first since the water may be stored at high pressure inside and come shooting out from the pipe.",
    "If the water doesn\u2019t get less pressurized coming out of the faucet, then you may need to turn off the water supply valve in an underground utility box located somewhere in your yard.",
    "Unscrew the screws holding the base of the faucet against the wall.",
    "Most frost-free faucets have bases that connect to the outside of your home to secure them in place.",
    "Use a screwdriver or a drill to turn the screws counterclockwise and remove them.",
    "Set the screws aside so you can use them later when you put in your new faucet.",
    "Your faucet may not have screws depending on the model.",
    "If it doesn\u2019t have screws, you can skip this step.",
    "Locate where the faucet connects to your pipes inside your home.",
    "Go inside your home so you\u2019re on the opposite side of the wall with your faucet, and look for a pipe leading in from outside.",
    "If there\u2019s a wall in front of the pipe and you can\u2019t see it, you will have to use a utility knife or drywall saw to cut through the wall.",
    "The end of the faucet inside your home will look like a long silver tube that screws directly into another pipe that leads to the main water supply line.",
    "If you aren\u2019t able to access your pipes from inside your home, then you need to contact a plumber or a specialist to locate the pipes for you.",
    "Unscrew the faucet from the pipes inside your home to prevent damage.",
    "Grip the faucet tube with a pair of pliers and the pipe it connects to with a pipe wrench.",
    "Hold the pipe wrench securely in place so the pipe doesn\u2019t twist around, and rotate the faucet counterclockwise to loosen it.",
    "Once it\u2019s completely loose, it will separate easily from the pipe.",
    "The pipe your faucet connects to may have a wingnut so you can easily unscrew it by hand without causing any damage.Warning: Don\u2019t try to unscrew a frost-free faucet from outside since you could break or bend the pipe it connects to inside your home and cause a leak.",
    "Pull the faucet out from the wall from outside.",
    "Go back outside once you\u2019ve detached the faucet from the pipe.",
    "Grab the faucet and pull it straight out from the wall to pull it out from the hole in the side of your home.",
    "The tube will easily come straight from the wall when you\u2019re finished.",
    "Get a new frost-free faucet that matches the diameter of your pipes.",
    "Frost-free faucets have a long stem so water doesn\u2019t freeze inside the end of your faucet and back up your pipes.",
    "Get a new frost-free faucet that matches the length of the old one so you can easily reinstall it on the pipe.",
    "Make sure the faucet diameter is the same as your pipe, which is usually \u20442\u2013\u20444 inch (1.3\u20131.9 cm) wide.",
    "You can get a frost-free faucet from a hardware or home improvement store.",
    "Don\u2019t replace a frost-free faucet with a regular faucet since they\u2019re more likely to freeze during cold weather.",
    "Wrap the end of the faucet with 3\u20134 layers of Teflon tape.",
    "Teflon tape waterproofs the connection to prevent leaks inside your home.",
    "Start the end of the Teflon tape along the faucet\u2019s threading where it connects to the pipe.",
    "Roll the tape clockwise around the threads until you have 3-4 layers.",
    "Rip the strip of tape off from the roll and press the end firmly against the threads to secure it.",
    "Don\u2019t roll the Teflon tape counterclockwise since it will easily tear off when you try to screw the faucet into the pipe.",
    "Screw the end of pipe onto the threading of the faucet.",
    "Slide the faucet through the hole on the outside of your home and push it in as far as it can go.",
    "Then go inside your home so you can see where the end of the faucet tube lines up with the pipe.",
    "Hold the pipe securely in place with your wrench and rotate the faucet tube by hand to screw it back in.",
    "Continue tightening the faucet until you feel resistance.",
    "Check outside to make sure the faucet points down, and make any adjustments by unscrewing the faucet slightly from the pipe.",
    "Be careful not to overtighten the faucet since you could cause the pipe to break or crack.",
    "Turn on the water supply to check for any leaks.",
    "Once you have the faucet firmly attached, turn the main supply valve so it\u2019s parallel to the pipe to turn your water back on.",
    "Check the faucet connection to make sure it\u2019s not leaking or dripping.",
    "If it\u2019s not, then you  can move on.",
    "If the faucet connection is leaking, turn off the water again and check that the Teflon tape is still intact or that the faucet is tight enough on the pipe.",
    "Secure the base of the faucet to the outside of your home with screws.",
    "Go back outside and locate the screw holes in the faucet base.",
    "Put the screws from the old base into the holes and use your drill to secure them to the side of your home.",
    "Continue tightening them until the faucet doesn\u2019t move around outside anymore."
