          "description":"Unlock your blade guard and replace the blade if necessary. To do this, loosen the bolt in the center of your blade with a wrench and twist it off. Take the flange off and pull your current blade out to remove it. Slide your new blade into the saw slot and add the flange before tightening the bolt as firmly as possible. It will say on the side of your saw blade whether or not your blade is designed to cut through metal. Any continuous or sharp-toothed blade that is used for metal cutting will work. A diamond blade will give you the cleanest results, but they're more expensive than a standard circular saw blade."

          "description":"Press the base plate of your saw against an edge where you want to start cutting. Brace the metal by applying pressure with your nondominant hand, holding it at least 2 feet (0.61 m) away from your saw. Pull the saw's trigger and carefully make your initial incision into the metal. If you're uncomfortable taking a hand off of the saw, you can weigh the sheet metal down with a heavy object. Clamps won't really work, since the grooves in corrugated metal make it hard to maintain the necessary tension."

          "description":"Your circular saw will do most of the work since it will be pulled forward from the traction from your saw blade. Guide the saw slowly through the metal and allow the excess piece that you cut to fall freely to the floor.Warning: If you experience kickback from your circular saw, release the trigger and allow it to come to a rest before you try to continue cutting. Avoid moving your circular saw at an angle as you cut. The grooves in corrugated metal will make it easy to cut a straight line, but if you try to turn your saw you'll risk losing control of it. This method is best for cutting long lengths of straight lines in corrugated metal."

If you're doing it correctly, it will feel like you're cutting with a pair of scissors! Be careful not to drop the section that you're holding in your nondominant hand, or you'll risk losing control of the snips or cutting your arm on the edge.
