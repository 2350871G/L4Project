Remove the steak from the fridge and set it on a plate on the counter for 20-30 minutes so it comes to room temperature. Sticking cold steak in the oven may cause it to cook unevenly, so it's important to let it warm up a bit. If the steak is frozen, completely thaw it in the fridge, which may take up to 12 hours. Avoid thawing meat on the counter which could cause harmful bacteria to grow. Once it's thawed, remove it from the fridge and allow it to warm up to room temperature."

If you don't have a cast iron skillet, use a stainless steel frying pan instead. Do not use a non-stick frying pan.
