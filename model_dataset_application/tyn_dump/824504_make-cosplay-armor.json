Hold your foam over the heat for just a few seconds. You can wear oven mitts to protect your hands, but you shouldn\u2019t heat the foam long enough for it to be painful to hold. The easiest way to heat your foam is with a heat gun, which you can find in the stamp section of crafting stores, but you can also use other options, like a gas stove or an iron over an ironing board.

You can mold it over a form, like a rolling pin, a box, or even your body, or bend it into shape with your fingers. The foam will cool quickly and will hold its new shape once the heat fades. If you don\u2019t shape it right the first time, return the foam to the heat source and try again. Try on the armor once it\u2019s cooled and make any adjustments you need to."

Lay out a piece large enough to cover the the back side of your piece of armor, then paint the back of the armor with an even coat of liquid glue. Place the fabric over it and smooth it into place, then let it dry and cut off the excess with scissors. Once it dries, brush on another coat of glue on top to seal it. If you want your armor to be even stronger, add a second layer of fabric backing; if not, simply let the glue dry.
