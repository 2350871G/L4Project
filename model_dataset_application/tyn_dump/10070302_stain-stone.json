Pressure washing should easily blast off all of the dirt and grime. Make sure to work methodically by spraying each section of the outdoor stonework in turn. If there are any hard-to-reach spots in the stonework that the pressure wash can\u2019t reach, scrub them clean with a stiff wire brush. If you cleaned outdoor decorative stone with a wire brush, you can just rinse it off with spray from a hose. Or, toss a couple of buckets of water over the stone."
