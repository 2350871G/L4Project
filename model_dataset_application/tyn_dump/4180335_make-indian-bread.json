If the mixture does not become foamy, it could mean that the yeast has died. Dead yeast will not be able to provide any lift for the dough, so you should discard it and start over with a new packet."

You may also need to dust your hands with flour while kneading the dough to prevent it from sticking to your skin."

Roll it between your hands until the ball becomes rounder and smoother, and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Note that you should keep at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space in between the dough when you arrange the portions on the baking sheet. The dough should have enough room to expand without the individual portions brushing into each other in the process."

Place a circle of naan on the prepared grill and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. It should become puffy, and the bottom should turn light brown in color. Brush the uncooked side of the naan with melted butter and flip the portion over. Brush the cooked side with butter, as well. Cook this second side for another 2 to 4 minutes, or until it also begins to brown. Remove the finished naan from the grill. Continue cooking the naan in this manner until all the dough has been used."

Keep a baking stone or baking sheet in the oven as it preheats, so the stone is just as hot as the oven when you place the uncooked naan on it. Dip your hands in water and lightly wet each piece of dough. Place a few rounds of uncooked naan onto your preheated baking stone in a single layer. Do not let them touch or overlap. Bake for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the naan turns golden brown. Remove the finished naan from the oven and immediately brush with melted butter. Repeat until all the naan is cooked. Wait 3 to 4 minutes in between batches so that the baking stone has time to heat up again."

Apply a thin coat of olive oil or cooking spray to a large skillet and heat the skillet on the stove for a few minutes on medium heat.

Place the dough back on your baking sheet or plate when done rolling it out. Heat oil in a deep pan. Pour 1 inch (2.5 cm) of oil into a deep, heavy skillet. Warm it on the stove using high heat.

    "Do not add too much, though, since too much flour can cause the dough to crumble.",
    "Let rest for 30 minutes.",
    "Cover the dough with a clean, damp dish towel and allow it to rest at room temperature.",
    "This dough will not rise as much as a dough with yeast in it would rise, but the resting period does still allow the dough to settle and form air pockets.",
    "Divide dough into even portions.",
    "Break off 2 to 3 inch (5 to 7.6 cm) portions of dough and roll them into balls.",
    "Arrange the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet, then cover them with a moist dish towel for a few minutes.",
    "A large plate would work just as well as a baking sheet here.",
    "You will not need the baking sheet to cook the bread.",
    "Instead, you only need something to place the uncooked dough on as it waits to be fried.",
    "Roll the portions into flat circles.",
    "Apply a light coating of olive oil to the balls of dough.",
    "Use your hands or a lightly oiled rolling pin to roll them out to circles with a diameter 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) long.",
    "Place the dough back on your baking sheet or plate when done rolling it out.",
    "Heat oil in a deep pan.",
    "Pour 1 inch (2.5 cm) of oil into a deep, heavy skillet.",
    "Warm it on the stove using high heat.",
    "The oil should reach a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) before you move on to the next step.",
    "If you do not have a food-safe thermometer to use for checking oil temperatures, test the oil by dropping a small piece of dough in it.",
    "If the dough steadily rises to the surface of the oil, the oil is hot enough.",
    "Fry the luchi.",
    "Gently place one circle of dough into the hot oil.",
    "After 1 to 2 minutes, or once the oil stops sizzling and the bottom side turns a deep cream color, gently turn the dough over and fry the other side for another minute or so.",
    "Each piece is done once both sides take on a golden-cream color.",
    "Remove the bread immediately after it finishes cooking.",
    "Repeat until all the circles of dough have been cooked.",
    "The bread should become puffy as it fries.",
    "You can enhance this effect by gently nudging the bread with a slotted spoon as it cooks in the oil.",
    "Drain and serve.",
    "Remove each finished luchi from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with clean paper towels.",
    "Let the excess oil drain off for a few minutes before eating and enjoying the luchi."
