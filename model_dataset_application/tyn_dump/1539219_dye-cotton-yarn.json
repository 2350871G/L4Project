Most importantly, make sure that the yarn is made from 100% cotton. Most fabric, yarn, and craft stores will have a special section in their yarn aisle for cotton yarn. Some cotton yarn is mercerized and has a shiny finish. You can still dye this type of yarn, but be aware that it may take the dye differently from other types of cotton yarn. Do not get yarn made from mixed materials, such as 50% cotton and 50% acrylic, or it may not dye evenly."

Keep wrapping the yarn until you have used up the entire ball. Wrap the yarn tight enough so that it doesn't slide off, but loose enough so that it doesn't stretch or feel uncomfortable. Do not dye your yarn while it is still in a ball, or it won't dye evenly. If your yarn came twisted like a rope, simply untwist the \"rope\" until you have a loop of yarn instead."

Add your yarn into the water, and press down on it to submerge it. Leave it there for 20 minutes. Yarn often contains coatings, such as wax, which can prevent the dye from adhering. Don't be alarmed if the water changes color to brown. This is simply the residue from the yarn."
