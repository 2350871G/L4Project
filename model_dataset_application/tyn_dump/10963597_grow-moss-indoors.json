Most moss species prefer these items as opposed to potting soil because it helps them develop faster. You can use either pine needles or rotten bark or mix both together to put over top of the base."

Twigs covered in moss also work well for this project. Make sure to wear gloves while you do this. Always ask permission from the correct authorities if you plan on collecting moss from public land or property. You want enough moss to cover your base entirely, so bring your containers of choice with you to get an accurate measurement of how much moss you need.Warning: You can buy moss online or at a floral shop if none grows near where you live. However, these mosses are often preserved, sometimes in chemicals. Preserved moss is usually dry, which means it can be difficult to work with. If you do want to buy moss, make sure you go for a fresh, living moss."

If you\u2019re going to put a lamp next to your moss garden to give it light, make sure the lamp isn\u2019t right over top of the container. Too much exposure to light will hurt the moss.Warning: A common mistake is to place the moss in a dark area under the assumption that this will keep the humidity high.
