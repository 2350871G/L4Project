You will need to make a chain that is a multiple of 15, and then add 12 more chain stitches. For example, you could crochet a chain of 60 plus 12 for a total of 72 chains, or crochet a chain of 150 plus 12 for a total of 162. There will be one rosebud every 15 chains, so the larger the chain, the more rosebuds you will be able to fit onto it. To make the first chain, loop the yarn over your hook twice and then pull the first loop through the second loop on your hook. Then, yarn over the hook once and pull through again to continue making the chain."
