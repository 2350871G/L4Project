Choose a location with studs to ensure the wall is strong enough to hold the weight of the unit. Install the unit at least 3.3 feet (1.0 m) away from antennas and power or connecting lines that are used for television, radio, home security systems, intercoms, or telephones. The electrical noise from these sources could cause operational problems for your air conditioner. Avoid locations where gas may leak or where oil mist or sulfur exists."
