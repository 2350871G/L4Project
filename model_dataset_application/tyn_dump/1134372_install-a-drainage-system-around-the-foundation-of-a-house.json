You will now connect the solid 4\u201dPVC pipe to the tee, which will leads to a percolation trench, dry well or to daylight. Cover the pipe with crushed stone, 8-10\u201d above the footing of the foundation. Then, pull the excess filter fabric over the crushed stone, making sure it laps against the foundation. It is important that the fabric completely cover the crushed stone, this will prevent the soil clogging the pipe."
