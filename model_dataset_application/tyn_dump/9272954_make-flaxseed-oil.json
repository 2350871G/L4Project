Hot presses are usually freestanding machines that you must turn on and allow to heat up before you can use them. Cold oil presses are usually attachments that connect to a juicer. Turn on or attach your press according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A hot press usually produces more oil because the heat helps soften the seeds to make it easier to extract the oil. It also makes the process go more quickly. You should usually allow a hot press to heat up for at least 10 minutes. A cold press usually requires more time to produce oil. However, it often leads to a better-tasting oil with more nutrients."

However, if you\u2019re making oil for the first time, it\u2019s best to start with a small amount to get used to the process. A pound (454 g) is usually a good amount to start with.

Consult the manufacturer\u2019s guide for the press or press attachment to ensure that you know how to use it.
