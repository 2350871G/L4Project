Next, press the leaves to the vase, smoothing out any air bubbles. Hold them in place for 5 to 10 seconds to give the leaves time to adhere. You can add as many or as few leaves as you like. Covering the entire surface of the vase with leaves creates a distinctive look, but having some space between the leaves can also be pretty. It\u2019s best to apply a single layer of leaves.
