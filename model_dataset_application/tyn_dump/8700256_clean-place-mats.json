Focus on any spots that have stains or food on them. Scrub in gentle, round motions to remove dirt and debris. Do not scrub the placemats hard or rub any areas for a long period of time. This can end up damaging the placemats."

Fill your sink with warm water and add a few drops of soap. Then, put the placemats in the water to soak for 1 to 2 minutes. Once the placemats have been soaked, take them out and use a sponge or cloth to wipe them off. Stains and pieces of food should be easier to remove once the placemats have been soaked."
