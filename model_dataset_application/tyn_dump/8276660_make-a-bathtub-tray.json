          "description":"First, think about what you intend to keep on your tray during baths and how much space each object will need. Make sure that you use a piece of lumber that is wide enough to hold everything. Allow extra space so nothing is sitting on the edge of the tray. For example:\nA 1\u201d x 10\u201d (2.5 x 25 cm) board should be wide enough to hold a book, candle, and glass with room to spare. However, be aware that lumber sizes (such as 1\u201d x 10\u201d) refer to when the wood is freshly cut before it dries out and shrinks. So, if you have something wider than 10 inches that you want to place on your tray, you will need a wider board than a 1\u201d x 10\u201d."

          "headline":"Choose how many layers of wood you will need.",
          "description":"Decide between making a simple tray with no raised surfaces or one with holders for certain objects. For the simplest tray, plan on using a single piece of lumber. Or, to minimize the risk of spilling stuff into the tub, purchase a second piece of equal size to create holders before attaching it to the base board. Alternately, you could rim the entire tray by screwing smaller pieces of lumber, like a 1\u201d x 2\u201d (2.5 x 5 cm), around all four edges of the base board instead of creating individual holders. Line the tray with wood trim on each side 1 to 1.5 in (2.5 to 3.8 cm) wider than the tray to have an attractive raised lip. Use a piece of plexiglass as the base layer and a piece of wood the same size on top with holders cut into it. The plexiglass is easy to clean, waterproof, and it will protect the wood."

Also double-check that the rim on either side is level with each other. Surround units (where the tub and the shower stall are all one unbroken piece) may incorporate designs without a level rim on the inside of the stall. An older clawfoot tub may not support a tray without it falling in. Add support legs to the ends of your tray so it braces against the side of the tub."

Ask the staff to cut it down to size to match the width of your tub. When you bring it home, double-check that the board rests on both sides of your tub\u2019s rim. If you are creating holders, remember to ask for a second board of equal size. To avoid confusion, remember that lumber sizes are H x W (for example, 1\u201d high and 10\u201d wide). Therefore you are cutting the board\u2019s length to match your tub\u2019s width."

          "headline":"Map out their placement.",
          "description":"Depending on what you\u2019re creating holders for, think about where on your tray is best to place each object. Consider what else you will be holding on your tray and how often you will be reaching for each item. Also consider which of your hands is dominant and most likely to do all the reaching. For example:\nPlacing a holder for a candle toward the back of the tray is always a good idea. This way you won\u2019t be reaching over an open flame for anything else. If you\u2019re right-handed, placing a cup holder on the right side and a candle holder on the left is advisable since you will be reaching for your cup more frequently than the candle, and vice versa if you\u2019re left-handed. Also keep in mind that your hands and arms will probably become wet at some point. So if you\u2019re creating a holder to place a book after reading, set this toward the rear or to the side of your cup holder so you don\u2019t drip water over it when you take your next drink. A hole \u20444 inch (19 mm) deep with a slot \u20442 inch (13 mm) thick can hold most wine glasses so they don\u2019t spill."

Now, for each object that will receive a holder, measure its bottom. Use these measurements to trace an outline on your topper to then cut out with a saw. Add an extra half-inch (1.25 cm) or so to each measurement to make sure the object has adequate room to fit. For square or rectangular holders, use a table saw to cut them. For circular holes, attach an appropriately sized hole saw to a screw gun."

          "description":"First, sand the edges of each cut with sandpaper so they\u2019re smooth, as well as the top of the base board. Then place the top board on top of the base board so they line up evenly. Use drywall screws to screw them together around all four sides. Make sure your screws aren\u2019t so long that they poke through the bottom of your base board. Also remember that lumber is usually thinner than described. So, for example, use 1.25\u201d (3.2 cm) screws for 2 boards that are each marked as 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. For a tighter seal, draw a line of wood glue along all four sides of the base board before setting the top board on it."

Once it dries, add a coat of wood finish (or, to make things simpler, use an all-in-one stain and finish mix to eliminate a step). Skip the stain if you want to, but definitely seal the wood with a finish to protect it from moisture. Steam from your bath may warp unprotected wood over time. Use a rag or brush to apply either one. When you do, brush or rub with the board\u2019s grain, not against it. Allow the stain to dry overnight before adding finish. Do the same after adding the finish before proceeding to the next step. Wear protective gloves when using stains and finishes.

Follow their directions for installation, since each type of hardware may have its own specific instructions. However, bear in mind:\nCupboards pulls as well as other forms of handles may require you to screw through the bottom of the tray, rather than the top. If so, expect the screw heads to project out of the bottom once they are screwed in. Even if you use flatheads, this may result in the screw heads scratching the rim of your tub. To avoid this, create a pilot hole by attaching a countersink bit to your screw gun. This will cut both a pilot hole for the screw as well as a slight divot in the wood\u2019s surface that will fit the screw head."

Technically, you could also consider this step optional, but consider it strongly advised. Not only will grippers reduce the chance of your tray slipping, but their soft material will also minimize the risk of damaging both your tray and tub. At minimum, use 1 gripper for each end of your tray. However, for best results, use as many as will fit between the tray and the rim of the tub, both lengthwise and widthwise."
