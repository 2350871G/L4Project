You can do this with a damp sponge or rag, but it may be more effective to brush the baking powder or cornstarch off with a large, fluffy makeup brush. Pre-Treating the Oil Stain Spray your oil stain with WD-40. Make sure that the spraying straw is attached to your WD-40 before you use it so that you can be in control of the application. Spray the WD-40 all over the stained area. Then, let it sit for 15-30 minutes. Use hairspray if you don\u2019t have WD-40. Hairspray can be applied in the same way that WD-40 is applied to help remove a good portion of the oil stain.

Rinse the area with hot water. After scrubbing, take your jeans to the sink or tub and run some hot water. Hold the jeans underneath the water and rinse off the stained area until all of the suds are gone. Washing Your Jeans Put your jeans, detergent, and vinegar into the washing machine. Toss your jeans into the washing machine and add in your regular laundry detergent. Then, measure out \u20442 cup (120 ml) of white vinegar and pour it into the washing machine. The vinegar should help to pull out any oil that remains in the jeans. Wash your jeans in hot water.
