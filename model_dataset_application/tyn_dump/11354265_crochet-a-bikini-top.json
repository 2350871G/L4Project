Choose a medium-weight cotton yarn that you like and get a size J-10 (6.0 mm) crochet hook. Pick your favorite color or use a variegated yarn for a more colorful bikini top.

The chain is finished when it\u2019s long enough to go from 1 armpit to the other while snug against your chest.

Insert the tail of the yarn on the chain through a yarn needle and sew through the edge of the bikini a few times to tack it into place. Then, tie a knot thought the last stitch to secure the chain to the edge of the bikini top. Make sure to attach 1 chain to the edges of each end of the bikini band as well as to the tops of each of the bikini cups. Cut any excess yarn on the ends of the chains. After you finish securing the chains to the bikini, cut any excess yarn that is left hanging on the bikini.

    "Go in through 1 side of the band and come out of the other side.",
    "Then, insert the needle through a stitch on the opposite side of the cup and bring it back out the other side.",
    "Repeat until you reach the end of the cup and then cut and tie off the yarn.",
    "Repeat this for both cups to secure them to the bikini band.",
    "Make 4 chains long enough to secure the bikini.",
    "Crochet a chain that is long enough to go all the way around the back of the bikini.",
    "Hold 1 end of the chain against the end of the band and check to see if you can pull it under your arm and across your back.",
    "This will likely be about 45 chains.",
    "Make a total of 4 chains this length and tie them off at the ends.",
    "Secure the ends of the chains to the band and cups.",
    "Insert the tail of the yarn on the chain through a yarn needle and sew through the edge of the bikini a few times to tack it into place.",
    "Then, tie a knot thought the last stitch to secure the chain to the edge of the bikini top.",
    "Make sure to attach 1 chain to the edges of each end of the bikini band as well as to the tops of each of the bikini cups.",
    "Cut any excess yarn on the ends of the chains.",
    "After you finish securing the chains to the bikini, cut any excess yarn that is left hanging on the bikini.",
    "There will likely be a few stray threads along the edges where you tied off the bikini strings, so cut these about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the knot so they will be less visible.",
    "Once you finish cutting the excess yarn, your bikini top is finished!",
    "Try it on and see how it looks."
