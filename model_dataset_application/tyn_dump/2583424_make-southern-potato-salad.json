Once they are all peeled, chop them into chunks. They don't need to be perfectly or uniformly chopped, but just make sure the pieces are big enough to eat in one bite \u2013 or about 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) thick."

          "description":"Fill a pot about half way with water and bring it to a boil. The pot should be large enough to fit all of the potatoes with a couple of inches of space at the top to spare. Once the water is boiling, add the potato pieces. Continue to boil until they are tender, which should take about seven to eight minutes. Keep checking on them regularly, because it's crucial that they do not get too soft. You want them to become tender, but not fall apart. You do not want to wind up with mashed potatoes."

Once the water starts to boil, remove the pot from the heat and let your eggs cook in the hot water for about eight to ten minutes. Once they are done cooking and have cooled, peel the shells off the eggs and dice them up. Learn the easiest ways to peel hardboiled eggs here!"

Put your potatoes in a large mixing bowl. Put the chopped eggs and potatoes into the refrigerator to chill. It's best to construct and season this salad after everything has cooled."

Once everything is stirred completely, sprinkle the paprika on top. The paprika completes the potato salad, both in taste and appearance. Keep your potato salad in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve it. This recipe makes about six servings. If your potato salad stays in the refrigerator without being warmed, it should last about 3-4 days. If your potato salad warms up \u2013 for example, if it sits out at a barbecue \u2013 leftovers should not be kept in the refrigerator any more than a day."
