          "description":"Keep your eye out for fallen branches that can be broken or whittled into the correct shape. You can use just about any type of wood to make a slingshot, provided it\u2019s strong enough to hold up when you pull back the sling. A piece that\u2019s roughly 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) long and 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) thick, however, will be the most comfortable and easiest to use. Search the ground near heavily wooded areas. These places will give you the most raw materials to choose from. Stripping loose, wet, or mossy bark from the outside of the wood may give you a better grip."

          "description":"Hang the frame of your slingshot over a heat source, such as a campfire or portable stove, turning it occasionally. Allow it to dry for several hours. As it heats up, the moisture it contains will slowly be released. That means that when you use the slingshot, the frame will have less give. Be extremely careful not to burn yourself when working near an open flame. Assuming you have access to household appliances, you can also wrap the damp wood in a towel and microwave it for 30 seconds at a time until the moisture has evaporated out of it."

This will provide a neat little slot for the bands you\u2019ll be using as the sling. If the notches are higher up on the prongs, the tension from the sling could cause them to snap. If they\u2019re too low, the projectile you\u2019re shooting could clip the bottom of the frame."

          "headline":"Cut an elastic band to serve as the sling.",
          "description":"Any thick, stretchy material that you have on hand can be converted to an effective firing mechanism. Heavy rubber bands, strips of latex sheeting, and even medical tubing are all good options, and will make for a slingshot with a lot of force. Once you\u2019ve gotten your hands on a suitable material, double it over and cut it into two identical pieces. Each piece should be approximately the same length as the frame. The exact length of the sling will depend on your preferred shooting style, as well as the materials you have to work with. A shorter sling will generate more power, but will also be more difficult to draw back. Leaving the bands a little longer will allow you to adjust the slack or start over if you make a mistake."

Snip off the short ends of the bands to get rid of the excess length. Your handmade slingshot is now finished! To ensure that your slingshot fires accurately, make sure the loose ends are close to the same length as possible. Otherwise, the sling will be lopsided. Test the knots around the pouch to make sure they\u2019re secure. If one of them comes loose while you\u2019re firing the slingshot, it could result in a painful accident."

About \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from each end of the rectangle, open up a hole just large enough to fit the ends of the sling through. The resulting pouch will create a nest for the projectile, holding it in place until it leaves the sling. A stiff fabric that offers some resistance, like leather or thick canvas, is ideal. Use the point of a pocket knife or similar tool to bore holes in the pouch. You can also cut a small slit in the fabric, though this may tear after a few uses."

The sling should now be one long piece, with the bands on either side and the pouch in the middle. If you want, you can reinforce the ends of the pouch by wrapping the bands in dental floss, then tying it off. Use a wooden slingshot to fire small stones, marbles, or metal BBs with maximum velocity. Slingshots are useful tools, but they can also be dangerous weapons. Never fire your slingshot at another person, even if you're just playing around."
