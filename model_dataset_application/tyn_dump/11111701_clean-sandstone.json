If your interior sandstone surfaces are not on the floor, such as if you have a sandstone counter top, use a dry towel or a small, hand-held brush to wipe all crumbs, dust, and other debris off of them.

If you are dealing with a sandstone floor surface and you don't want to get on your hands and knees, you can use a microfiber mop head or other soft floor cleaning mop. Rinse out the rag if it gets very dirty and then continue on until the entire surface has been cleaned.Tip: When you are wiping down the surface, notice whether the water appears to absorb into the sandstone or if it beads up on top. If it absorbs into the stone, that means the stone has no sealant. If it beads up, the stone has been sealed. Sandstone that is not sealed is more prone to staining, so it needs to be used more carefully."
