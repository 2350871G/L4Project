  "text":" Frying a Quesadilla on a Stove Choose your filling and mix it together in a bowl. You can use any combination of vegetables, meats, or grains, so long as you end up with \u00bd cup (120 grams). If you are using meat or vegetables, make sure that they are cooked. Here are some suggestions to get you started:\nFor meat, try thinly-sliced steak, pulled pork, or shredded chicken breast. For vegetables, try sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, or corn. For beans, try black beans or pinto beans. Heat a lightly-greased 12 inch (30.5 centimeter) skillet over medium or medium-high heat. You will need only about \u00bd teaspoon of butter or oil; avoid using too much, or your quesadilla will become too soggy. If using oil, try going for a lighter oil, such as canola or vegetable oil; olive oil will give the quesadilla too strong of a flavor. Place the tortilla on the skillet once the butter has melted. Make sure that the butter is spread evenly across the surface of the pan. At this point, you can start adding your fillings or you can flip the tortilla over and let it toast slightly on both sides; this will give you a crunchier quesadilla. Spread \u00bd cup (50 grams) of shredded Cheddar cheese over the entire tortilla. If you do not like Cheddar cheese, you can use another type of shredded cheese, such as cheddar, Colby, Fontina, or Monterey Jack. Add the rest of the ingredients, covering only one half of the tortilla. You will be folding the tortilla in half later. Avoid putting too many fillings in, or your tortilla will be too bulky and tear. Wait until the cheese begins to melt fold the tortilla in half. Slip the spatula under the cheesy side of the quesadilla and lift upwards, flipping it over onto the fillings. Gently press the quesadilla flat with the spatula. Transfer the quesadilla to a cutting board. If there is any excess grease on the tortilla, you can wipe it off using a paper towel. Cut the quesadilla into wedges. Cut the quesadilla in half using a sharp knife, then cut each wedge in half again, creating four pizza-like slices. Serve the quesadilla. You can add toppings, such as salsa or sour cream. Baking a Quesadilla in an Oven Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0C). Make sure that there is nothing inside your oven, and that the baking rack is positioned in the center. Lightly grease a tortilla and set it down on a baking sheet. Make sure that it is greased-side down. The grease will help make the quesadilla crispy. Spread \u00bc cup (25 grams) of cheese over the tortilla. You will be adding the rest of the cheese later; the two layers of cheese will help \"glue\" the quesadilla together. You can use Cheddar cheese, or any other type of shredded cheese. Add \u00bd cup (120 grams) of your chosen fillings and spread them across the entire tortilla. If you are using meat or vegetables, make sure that they are cooked most of the way though; the filling will cook only partially in the oven. Add the rest of your cheese. Make sure that it is spread evenly across the quesadilla. Cover the quesadilla with another tortilla. Do not fold it in half. Instead, gently press down on your quesadilla with the back of your spatula; this helps \"seal\" it. Bake the quesadilla for 5 minutes. Place the baking sheet in the middle of the oven and close the oven. Flip the quesadilla over and return it to the oven. Take the baking sheet out and use a spatula to flip the quesadilla over. Be careful, so that the quesadilla does not fall apart. Once you have flipped the quesadilla, put it back into the oven. Bake the quesadilla for another 5 minutes or until it is golden brown.

Grilling Your Quesadilla Over a Grill Choose your shredded cheese and other fillings, and put them into a bowl. You will need \u00bd cup (50 grams) of cheese and \u00bd cup (120 grams) of a filling of your choice, such as diced tomatoes, onions, shredded chicken breast, or beans. Gently toss your fillings together in a clean bowl. Turn your grill on and set the heat to medium. Avoid using too high heat; it will only make your quesadilla burn instead of cooking faster. Put the tortilla on the grill. Make sure that the grill is clean, so that the charcoal doesn't transfer to the tortilla. Spread your toppings over half of the tortilla. Use a spoon to scoop the fillings out of the bowl and transfer them onto the tortilla. Fold the tortilla in half. Work quickly, so that the tortilla doesn't harden; if you wait too long, the tortilla will become crispy and break in half. Slip a spatula under the side of the tortilla that does not have anything on it, and lift upwards, folding the tortilla in half. Gently press down onto the tortilla with the spatula and let it grill for 3 to 4 minutes. Be sure to watch your quesadilla so that it does not burn.

    "Serve the quesadilla.",
    "You can eat it as it is, or add some toppings, such as salsa or sour cream.",
    "Grilling Your Quesadilla Over a Grill Choose your shredded cheese and other fillings, and put them into a bowl.",
    "You will need \u00bd cup (50 grams) of cheese and \u00bd cup (120 grams) of a filling of your choice, such as diced tomatoes, onions, shredded chicken breast, or beans.",
    "Gently toss your fillings together in a clean bowl.",
    "Turn your grill on and set the heat to medium.",
    "Avoid using too high heat; it will only make your quesadilla burn instead of cooking faster.",
    "Put the tortilla on the grill.",
    "Make sure that the grill is clean, so that the charcoal doesn't transfer to the tortilla.",
    "Spread your toppings over half of the tortilla.",
    "Use a spoon to scoop the fillings out of the bowl and transfer them onto the tortilla.",
    "Fold the tortilla in half.",
    "Work quickly, so that the tortilla doesn't harden; if you wait too long, the tortilla will become crispy and break in half.",
    "Slip a spatula under the side of the tortilla that does not have anything on it, and lift upwards, folding the tortilla in half.",
    "Gently press down onto the tortilla with the spatula and let it grill for 3 to 4 minutes.",
    "Be sure to watch your quesadilla so that it does not burn.",
    "Flip your quesadilla over and let it grill for 3 to 4 more minutes.",
    "Slide the spatula under the quesadilla and quickly flip it over.",
    "Be careful, so that it does not come apart and spill everything into the grill.",
    "Take the quesadilla off the grill and serve it.",
    "Use a spatula to move the quesadilla from the grill to a plate.",
    "Cut it into wedges using a sharp knife.",
    "You can eat the quesadilla as it is, or serve it with toppings, such as salsa or sour cream.",
    "Cooking Your Quesadilla in a Microwave Put a tortilla on a microwave-safe plate.",
    "To prevent the tortilla from getting soggy, consider placing a paper towel underneath it.",
    "Spread \u00bd cup (50 grams) of shredded cheese over the tortilla.",
    "Make sure that the cheese is spread evenly across the entire tortilla.",
    "Add \u00bd cup (120 grams) of cooked meat, vegetables, or herbs.",
    "If you are using meat or vegetables, make sure that they are cooked most of the way through; they will cook the rest of the way in the microwave.",
    "Cover the quesadilla with another tortilla.",
    "The tortilla will break if you try to fold it in half, so you will have to cover it with another piece.",
    "You can press down lightly on the tortilla to \"seal\" it.",
    "Put the tortilla in the microwave and cook it for 30 seconds or until the cheese melts.",
    "The quesadilla will not be as crispy as one made in a frying pan, oven, or grill.",
    "If the cheese is not melted, microwave the tortilla for another 30 to 60 seconds.",
    "Transfer the quesadilla to a new plate.",
    "The old plate will likely be too hot to handle without any pot holders.",
    "Cut the tortilla into wedges and serve it.",
    "Consider serving the quesadilla with some sour cream or salsa.",
    "Choosing Your Ingredients Choose a shredded, melting cheese.",
    "When buying cheese for your quesadilla, go for a softer one; it will melt easier than a harder cheese.",
    "You can use any of the following cheeses, or even a combination:\nAny of the following non-aged cheeses: Asiago, Gouda\nColby or Cheddar\nFontina, Gruy\u00e8re, or Havarti\nMonterey Jack or Mozzarella\nParmesan or Provolone\nRomano or Queso Oaxaca Consider adding a fresh cheese to the mix.",
    "Fresh cheeses will be more difficult to melt in a quesadilla, but they can be mixed in with any of the melting cheeses.",
    "Here are some suggestions:\nGoat cheese\nFeta cheese\nFromage blanc\nRicotta Add some vegetables.",
    "Quesadillas don't have to include meat.",
    "You can add a bit of color and flavor with both fresh and cooked vegetables.",
    "Here are some ideas:\nFresh vegetables: baby arugula, baby spinach, chilies, or diced tomatoes.",
    "Cooked vegetables: chilies, diced eggplant, roasted bell peppers, and sliced mushrooms.",
    "Canned vegetables: Black beans, black olives (sliced), chilies, corn, pinto beans, and sun-dried tomatoes.",
    "Use sliced or shredded meat.",
    "This will prevent the meat from creating too much bulk and tearing the tortilla.",
    "Make sure that the meat is cooked.",
    "Here are the following types of meat you can use:\nShredded chicken breast\nPulled pork\nShrimp\nSliced steak Lend your quesadilla some flavor with herbs and onions.",
    "Onions and peppers can make your quesadilla taste spicier while herbs will give it a milder, more aromatic flavor.",
    "Here are some ideas:\nGive your quesadilla a spicy kick with some crushed red pepper flakes or chopped smoked paprika.",
    "Add some chopped fresh herbs, such as: basil, chives, cilantro, mint, oregano, parsley, tarragon, or thyme.",

    "Chop up and saut\u00e9 some garlic, leeks, onions, scallions, or shallots.",
    "Try combining different ingredients.",
    "Here are some suggestions:\nFor a classic quesadilla, mix equal parts of cheese and shredded chicken breast.",
    "For a south-western twist, add black beans and corn salsa to your cheese.",
    "Make a barbecue chicken quesadilla by tossing some shredded chicken breast with some barbeque sauce.",
    "For the cheese, try using Monterey Jack.",
    "If you love bacon, try adding some chopped up fried bacon and a few jalape\u00f1o slices.",
    "For the cheese, try using Cheddar.",
    "Consider adding some toppings.",
    "You can eat your quesadilla as it is, or you can make it even tastier by adding toppings such as:\nSalsa or pico de gallo\nGuacamole\nSour cream\nSliced green onion"
