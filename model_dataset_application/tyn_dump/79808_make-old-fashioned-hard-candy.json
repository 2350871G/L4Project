Try adding the color after stirring in flavor and stir lightly for a swirled effect. Mix flavors or Kool Aid or pour over dried fruit for an added texture. Pour the molten sugar onto a greased cookie sheet. Allow it to cool. Spread the mixture around the sheet before it cools too much. It is not advised to put the mixture inside the freezer as it makes it harden too fast. Try pouring into candy molds or mini muffin pans instead for a consistent shape. After the sheet cools (30 minutes to an hour), break up the candy into several pieces.  Dust with powdered sugar. For a variation, do not dust the pieces\u2013\u2013simply leave them as they are and they will look like stained glass. The powdered sugar keeps the candy pieces from sticking together and becoming a large, sharp lump. If you like the effect of the colors without the powdered sugar, make sure you store the pieces on pieces of wax paper and not touching one another. Store if needed. This candy is best stored in paper bags or metal tins for a fun snack or a quick sugar craving. Fruit Drops Gather the ingredients and items needed before starting. Have everything in place. Line the baking pan. Use parchment or baking paper, or grease lightly. Pour the sugar, glucose and 175ml/6 fl oz of water into the heavy based saucepan. Using a wooden spoon, stir until the sugar dissolves. Place on the heat source. Bring to the boil. Cover, then boil for another 3 minutes. Remove the cover. Boil until the temperature reaches 154\u00baC/310\u00baF, also known as the hard crack stage. (See How to test candy hardness stages for more information). Add the cream of tartar and the fruit extract (essence) of choice. Mix through quickly. Pour the candy syrup into the prepared pan.  Leave until the candy is cool enough to handle.

Gently heat and stir well to ensure that the sugar dissolves. Add the measured coloring to the syrup. Bring to the boil, then cover and boil for another 3 minutes. Remove the cover. Boil until the temperature reaches 130\u00baC/265\u00baF, the hard ball stage. Remove the syrup from the heat. Separate quickly into three or four batches. Pour in the chosen flavoring for each batch. Using a soup spoon or a dessert spoon, drop small, round shapes of syrup onto the parchment covered tray. Carefully add a lollipop stick to each round, covering with a little more syrup if needed. Allow to cool and harden. Carefully remove them from the parchment paper. Wrap in clear cellophane or stick into a lollipop holder and they're ready to be shared around or given away as a gift. Barley Sugar Assemble the ingredients and items needed before starting. Have everything in place. Prepare the baking pan by covering in parchment paper or oil a marble slab. Cook the hulled barley in the water gently for 5 hours. Keep the heat low and be aware that it's easy to burn barley, so keep a regular check on the water level. Strain the liquid. It will look like white jelly. Then return it to the pan. Warm the sugar.
