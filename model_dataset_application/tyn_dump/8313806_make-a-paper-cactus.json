Coat the outer part of it with glue. If you think of it as a card, the outside of the \"card\" is the part that gets the glue. Attach the remaining cactus parts. Unfold the remaining two cacti. Align them with the matching halves on the glue-covered cactus. Press them together, and let the glue dry. If you need to, trim off any excess, overlapping paper with a pair of scissors.

Making a Papier M\u00e2ch\u00e9 Cactus Cut a disk out of Styrofoam, and wedge it into a flower pot. Trace the top of a flower pot on a sheet of 1\u00bd-inch (3.81-centimeter) thick foam.
