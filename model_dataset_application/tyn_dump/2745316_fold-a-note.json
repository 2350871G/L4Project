    "Flip the paper and fold the bottom triangle up.",

    "Fold the upper triangle down and crease it.",
    "Bring the point of the upper triangle down so that it meets the base of the lower triangle.",
    "Crease it well and unfold it temporarily.",
    "Note that the base of the upper triangle does not need to line up with the top of the paper.",
    "It is more important that the point of the upper triangle meets the base of the lower triangle.",
    "Form a small diamond with the bottom corners.",
    "Take the top layer of the bottom right corner and fold it up so that it meets the point of the bottom triangle.",
    "Repeat this with the bottom left corner to make the diamond shape.",
    "You will be looking at a square with a diamond in the middle and a triangle on top.",
    "Refold the top triangle and form a diamond with its corners.",
    "Fold the top triangle down so it overlaps the bottom triangle again.",
    "Fold the top layer of the right and left corners down to meet the tip of the upper triangle.",

    "Bring the bottom corners in temporarily to make a horizontal crease.",

    "Bend the tips inward toward the top tip of the diamond.",

    "Pull the flaps of the bottom diamond into those of the top.",
    "Bring each half of the bottom diamond up so that it crosses the base layer of the paper.",
    "Make sure each side is resting behind the corresponding half of the top diamond.",
    "The note will now look like a rectangle with 2 loose flaps on the upper diamond.",
    "Tuck the flaps of the upper diamond into the newly-created pockets to secure them.",
    "Carefully unfold each flap.",
    "Fold the flaps in the opposite direction and tuck them into the top-most pockets.",
