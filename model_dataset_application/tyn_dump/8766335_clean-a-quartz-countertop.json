          "description":"To keep your quartz countertops clean, you usually won\u2019t need anything more sophisticated than a gentle soap solution. Generally, it\u2019s best to use a mild dish detergent that doesn\u2019t contain any astringents or harsh chemicals. These substances can wear down quartz with repeated use. The resins used to seal quartz make the finish resistant to everyday dust, dirt, stains and mold. Warm water is more effective for releasing resilient messes than cold water."

For dried or sticky residue, apply more soap solution as needed. Get in the habit of scrubbing your countertops every time you do any major cooking, baking or meal prep."

Soak up standing water with a paper towel and allow the quartz to air dry. Soaps can dry into a scummy residue if they\u2019re not properly washed away. Once your countertop is dry, wipe it down with your hands to make sure that no food remains."

          "description":"Commercial quartz is non-porous, which means it won\u2019t absorb and lock in stains. However, it\u2019s still a good idea to address spills, crumbs and other messes before they have a chance to set up. This will save you the trouble of employing more intensive measures later on. The natural grain and color pattern of quartz may cause some messes to go unnoticed. With a modest amount of maintenance, you can keep your quartz countertops looking new for years."

It will also help to spray the gunk with warm water to soften it and make it easier to lift off with a little elbow grease. Use only flexible plastic scrapers (never metal) or nonabrasive sponges and be careful not to apply too much pressure. Doing so may create small scratches or abrasions that can worsen over time.

A little distilled white vinegar can cut right through this film. Combine equal parts vinegar and water in a spray bottle, mist the entire counter surface and run a soft kitchen sponge over it to leave behind a streak-free shine. If you don\u2019t have any vinegar on hand, you can also use an equivalent amount of hydrogen peroxide. Vinegar is a useful natural cleaner, but its sour smell can be overpowering. Mixing in a few drops of lemon juice or your favorite essential oils will infuse the room with a pleasant scent."

Apply the cleaner lightly to the countertops and let it sit for a couple of minutes, then rub out the mess and the remaining cleaner using a damp cloth. Ordinary rubbing alcohol may also be useful for loosening unusual substances."

A spritz of glass cleaner will help reduce some of the murkiness, leaving the finish looking polished and sparkling. This is a good project to complete about once a month, or whenever you notice that your countertops no longer shine like they used to. Common household products like Windex, Clorox Multi-Surface and 3M Glass Cleaner are all safe to use on quartz. After using glass cleaner, wipe the countertops with a cloth or sponge rather than a paper towel to avoid leaving behind tiny fibers."
