In some people, the rash can be quite severe, so it\u2019s best to err on the side of caution and cover yourself up completely with a long-sleeved shirt, pants, socks, closed-toed shoes, and rubber gloves. You can also cover your hands and arms with bread bags as an extra precaution if you plan to pull the plants up by hand. For extra security, use duct tape to close any gaps between your sleeves and gloves or your pants and socks.Tip: Cover your shoes and the lower half of your pants with garbage bags.
