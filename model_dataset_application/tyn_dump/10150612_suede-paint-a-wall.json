For this project, you\u2019ll need to buy paint that is specifically designed to have a suede finish. Although suede paint is not the most commonly used, you can generally find it at most hardware stores like Home Depot. Ralph Lauren and Valspar both also make their own versions of brushed suede paint. You can also create a suede finish on your wall by painting a coat of suede paint over a base coat of normal paint that will show through. If you choose to go this route, make sure you buy ordinary paint as well."

Once this is done, and any exposed light fixture wires are safely wrapped, you can restore power to the room.

Then fill in the area around this X with more X\u2019s roughly half as big and slightly overlapping one another.
