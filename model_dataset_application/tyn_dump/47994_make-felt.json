  "text":" Making a Felt Sheet Use your fingers to pull apart some wool into tufts. Do not cut the wool into tufts. This will create sharp edges and make it difficult to felt. Also, be sure to get pure wool and not acrylic; acrylic fibers will not felt. Many crafters will recommend Merino wool for its fine fibers. The wool does not have to be naturally colored! Consider getting some dyed wool! Lay the tufts out on a baking sheet, overlapping each row like scales on a fish. Make sure that the fibers are all going in the same direction. You do not have to cover the entire baking sheet; an 8 by 8 inch (20.32 by 20.32 centimeters) square will be plenty. Lay out more tufts in a second layer with the fibers going perpendicular to the last one. For example, if all the tufts were going up-and-down in the first layer, make all the tufts go side-to-side in this layer. You can also experiment with using a different color of wool for this layer. Be sure to use a color that complements the first one, however, or you might get a muddy result. Repeat the first two layers, if desired, for a thicker felt sheet. Remember to alternate the direction in which the fibers are going with each layer.
