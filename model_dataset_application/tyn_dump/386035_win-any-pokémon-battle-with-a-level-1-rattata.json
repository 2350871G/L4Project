      "description":"If in the middle of a battle, switch in the Rattata in a way that it will not take any damage. This can be done by switching it in when another Pok\u00e9mon faints, when your opponent uses a non-damaging move, or when a slower Pok\u00e9mon use U-Turn, Volt Switch, or Baton Pass after the opponent's attack. Make sure there are no entry hazards on the field, and Hail or Sandstorm is not active. Any damage the Rattata takes before it gets a turn, or that doesn't leave it at 1 HP, will break your Focus Sash and render your Rattata unable to win."

The Focus Sash saves Rattata from getting one-shot, leaving it with 1 HP instead. Endeavor then makes your opponent's HP equal to Rattata's, putting it at 1 HP. If your opponent did not attack your Rattata or leave it at 1 HP, and its Focus Sash is not broken, use Endeavor again."
