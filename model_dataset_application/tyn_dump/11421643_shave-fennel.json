While holding the bulb steady, slice straight down through each stalk to remove it. To cleanly cut through the fennel, use a sharp knife. Pick one that is big enough to cut all the way through the fennel, such as a chef\u2019s knife. The stalks and frond leaves have plenty of flavor, so consider saving them for another use. The stalks could be used to make vegetable stock, for instance. The leaves could be used for tea or salads."

If the fennel has any, remove them by cutting about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the end of the bulb. Slice straight down through the bulb to sever the roots. The root end of the bulb may need to be trimmed a little to even it out. Cut gradually and test the bulb by standing it on its root end. If it stays up, it will be easier to cut into shave-able pieces."

Keep removing layers until you reach the soft, tender part of the bulb. In many cases, you only have to peel back 1 or 2 layers.

Repeat the process until you can no longer hold and peel the piece of fennel. Note that the fennel bulb has a tough inner core. It\u2019s triangular-shaped at the base of the bulb.
