    "Stop turning the bolts once you feel resistance.",
    "Continuing to rotate them could strip the threads or damage the wall.",
    "Once the flanges open, you can turn the screws counterclockwise a few times so they stick out from the wall a little more.",
    "Use this to help ensure the brackets are rest flush against the wall.",
    "Rotate each bolt screw counterclockwise to remove it from the wall.",
    "Use a screwdriver or drill to remove it.",
    "The bolt will stay in place thanks to the flanges clinging to the wall.",
    "The screw leaves behind an open hole for you to use when installing the brackets.",
    "Save the screws for reuse.",
    "Keep a small container nearby to drop the screws in while you\u2019re working.",
    "Screw the brackets to the molly bolts.",
    "Reuse the screws you removed from the molly bolts.",
    "If you need new ones, match them to the bolt size you are using.",
    "Hold the brackets over the molly bolts, fit the screws in place, then rotate them clockwise to secure the brackets.",
    "Try using \u204432 in (0.24 cm)-wide bolts if you have to get replacements.",
    "It\u2019s the average size many molly bolts use, so you may still need a different size.",
    "Place the shelves on the brackets to hang them.",
    "Fit the shelf into place according to the type of bracket you have.",
    "Most of the time, all you have to do is rest the shelf on top of the brackets.",
    "Test the shelf and brackets by attempting to move them.",
    "Make sure the brackets are stable before putting anything on top of them.",
    "Using Heavy Toggles Fit the metal ends of the toggles into the pilot holes.",
    "Hanging toggles have a metal tip on one end and a long plastic strap on the other end.",
    "The metal tip is the one that goes into the wall.",
    "Push it all the way through the hole you made.",
    "Set a different toggle in each hole.",
    "Toggle bolts are the best option for shelves between 30 and 50 lb (14 and 23 kg).",
    "Some bolts can bear more weight than that.",
    "They also work for both drywall and plaster.",
    "Slide the plastic ring toward the wall if your bolts have them.",
    "Look for a small ring along the center part of the plastic strap.",
    "Hold onto the ring with one hand while holding the end of the strap with your other hand.",
    "Then, pull the plastic strap toward you while also pushing the ring back toward the wall.",
    "The flanges on the shaft will open, securing the bolt to the inner part of the wall.",
    "Note that there are also metal spring toggles that work similarly to molly bolts.",
    "Since they don\u2019t have plastic straps, slot them through the mounting brackets and into the wall, then tighten them.",
    "Snap the plastic end off the bolt if it has one.",
    "Grasp the plastic strap near where it emerges from the wall.",
    "Bend it down, then bend it back up again.",
    "It should detach, leaving only the bolt behind.",
    "If you\u2019re having a hard time removing the strap, pull the ends of the strap apart.",
    "Then, push them against the wall until they crack.",
    "Screw the brackets to the open toggles.",
    "With the plastic straps out of the way, you can screw the brackets to the toggles.",
    "Hold the brackets up to the wall, aligning the screw holes with the toggles.",
    "Fit a screw in each one.",
    "Then, turn the screws clockwise until they are tight and almost level with the brackets.",
    "Make sure the screws are straight.",
    "If they are crooked, they won\u2019t fit cleanly in the toggles.",
    "Also, don\u2019t overtighten them.",
    "Hang the shelves on the brackets.",
    "Test the brackets first by touching and attempting to move them.",
    "If they don\u2019t feel stable, check to make sure the brackets are well-secured and that the toggles are flush with the wall.",
    "Make adjustments as needed before putting anything on the shelves."
