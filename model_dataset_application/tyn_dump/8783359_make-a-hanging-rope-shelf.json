Add eighteen inches (45 cm) to that number for the knots you\u2019ll make in the rope. For example, if your ceiling is eight feet (2.4 m) tall and you want your shelf to sit five feet (1.5 m) from the floor, you\u2019re designating three feet (91 cm) of space between the ceiling and where the shelf ends. Double three feet (91 cm) and you get six feet (1.8 m); add eighteen inches (45 cm) to that number. Thus, you\u2019ll want two pieces of rope that are 7\u00bd feet (2.3 m) each."

Then add eighteen inches (45 cm) for each knot. Each length of rope will have one knot under each shelf. For example, if your ceiling is eight feet (2.4 m) high and you want the shelves to end four feet (1.2 m) from the ground, the shelves will hang in a four-foot (1.2 m) area. Double the number four to get eight feet (2.4 m). If you have five shelves, you\u2019ll need to add 7.5 feet (2.3 m) to each length of rope (18\u201d x 5 = 90\u201d, or 45 cm x 5 =2.3 m). Thus, you\u2019ll want 15.5 feet (4.7 m) for each length of rope. Knots can take up a lot of room; it\u2019s better to end up with excess rope than not enough. You can trim off any excess later."
