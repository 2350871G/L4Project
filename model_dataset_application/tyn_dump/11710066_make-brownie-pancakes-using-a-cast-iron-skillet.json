  "text":" Preparing the Dry Ingredients Pour half a bag of brownie mix into a clean bowl.  Put 2\u2153 cups of pancake flour in after the brownie mix.  Combine both, using a whisk until there is a slight color change. The dry batter should be a lighter brown with tiny amounts of pancake flour left. Preparing the Raw Ingredients Break two large eggs into the dry ingredient bowl, watching out for any dropped egg shells.  Pour in 1 cup of milk, making sure that the batter doesn\u2019t become too thin. If the batter is too thin (watery consistency) add another cup of brownie mix and 2\u2153 cups of pancake flour. Whisk using an upper motion, using a whisk while holding the bowl until combined. You should not see bubbles in the batter. If so, add a half cup of brownie mix. If the brownie pancake batter is too thick, add a \u2153 cup milk and whisk again. Whisk until the brownie pancake batter is smooth with small lumps (from pancake flour). Add a teaspoon or two of confectioners\u2019 sugar if you want a sweeter pancake. Frying on the Stovetop Take out the cast iron skillet, and turn the heat onto low heat, slightly higher than simmer. Once the stove says HOT SURFACE or ELEMENT ON, pour a \u2153 cup cooking oil onto the surface and wait for it to spread. If the surface is still too dry, add \u00bc cup more of cooking oil and spread around with the spatula. Move the bowl and whisk next to the stove top.  Have a \u2153 measuring cup next to you. Do not use the same one that was used for raw ingredients. Add a drop of batter to see whether or not the batter is too thin. If the batter is the perfect consistency, then wait for the oil to heat up. Pour \u2153 of the batter into the measuring cup, once the canola oil starts popping, and pour it on the skillet lifting it above until it runs out.  Fill the measuring cup with more batter.  Whisk the batter to prevent air bubbles from rising.  Watch the skillet to see if the pancake has bubbles forming on the tops and, with the spatula, quickly flip it over. Scrape at the sides to see if it\u2019s ready to be flipped. Add more oil on the surface and spread it with the spatula if pancakes burn too quickly at low heat. Repeat until all batter is used and store the leftovers in a covered container with parchment paper on the bottom. ",
