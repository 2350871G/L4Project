  "text":" Preparing the Muffin Pan Prepare the muffin pan. The muffin pan will only ever be useful for this project, so be sure to use one that can be drilled, not your favorite muffin pan! Drill a small hole in the bottom of each muffin cup. Place the muffin pan on top of the broiler pan. You will be cooking the formed bacon inside the muffin pan. The hole will allow the grease to drip out and into the broiler. Rolling the Bacon into Rosebuds Make your rosebuds with the raw bacon. Don't worry\u2013\u2013it's really easy. Simply lay one piece of bacon on a clean flat surface and roll up. You have a rose! Place the rolled bacon in one muffin cup and repeat the process until the tin is full.  Place the bacon roses in a 375\u00baF/190\u00baC oven. Bake for approximately 30 to 40 minutes or until crisp. Making a Bunch of Bacon Roses Remove the flower portion from the fake roses.
