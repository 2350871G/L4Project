This means that 1 cup (190 g) of uncooked rice will puff up into about 2-2.5 cups (380-475 g) of rice once cooked.Tip: You can use a slow cooker to fix any type of rice, including white, brown, wild, or long-grain jasmine or basmati."

Continue rinsing your rice until the water runs clean, then shake the sieve a few times to get rid of excess water. Alternatively, you can swish your rice in a shallow bowl full of water, draining and replacing the water when it becomes cloudy. A good washing will eliminate any starchy residue on the outside of your rice, which can help prevent sticking and clumping."

While any type of slow cooker will get the job done, a large, oblong variety that holds at least 6 quarts (5.7 L) will work provide the most even and consistent heating. One of the best things about using a slow cooker is that everything is done in a single piece of cookware, which means less prep work and faster cleanup!"

If you want to give this method a shot, heat some water in a kettle on the stovetop, then pour it into a glass liquid measuring cup to make sure you\u2019re using the correct amount. The idea behind this is that it starts cooking the rice right away rather than heating up gradually. As a result, the rice is less likely to turn out overly soft or gummy. Never pour boiling water into kitchenware made from plastic or similar materials, as it could easily melt."

Once you\u2019ve added the water, give your rice a quick stir to fully incorporate it. Then, place the lid on the slow cooker. Brown rice usually requires more water to cook to perfection, while white rice can get by with a little less.

Double-check that there are no gaps in the paper where steam might be able to escape.

Make sure your slow cooker is properly hooked up and positioned, and that there are no objects nearby that could cause it to come unplugged accidentally. You can also cook your rice on a lower heat setting if you\u2019re going to be out of the house all day. Keep in mind, though, that this will likely add 3-4 hours to your overall cook time."
