          "description":"Unscrew the hinge at the top of the compass to move the arms; the distance between the 2 points will make up the radius of your circle, which means it will be half the size of the final circle. Tighten the hinge when you have it to the size you want. Set the sharp point in the middle of your circle with the compass straight up so the pencil hits the cardboard, too. Push down on the needle part, and twist the top of the compass to turn it in a circle, which will be marked with the pencil. If the pencil isn't close enough to the paper, you can unscrew the small screw on its side. Pull the pencil down some. It should hit the cardboard while the sharp point of the compass is straight up and down. When you get it adjusted, tighten the screw again. A compass is a hinged instrument with 2 arms. One arm has a sharp point, and the other holds a pencil. The size of the circle you can draw will be limited by how long the arms of the compass are."

          "description":"If you need a bigger circle, make a loop out of yarn and stretch it so it's taut. The length will be the radius (halfway across) the circle. Press a thumbtack into the cardboard where you want the center of the circle to be and loop the yarn over it. Then, place the pencil in the outer edge of the yarn loop. Stretch the string taut and move the pencil around the thumbtack, pressing down to make a mark as you do. This circle may not be quite as precise as a compass, but it will likely do for most projects."

Using Scissors to Cut the Circle Out Pick a sharp, inexpensive pair of scissors. Cardboard tends to dull scissors quickly, so you may want to choose a pair that's not too expensive. Alternatively, invest in a pair of scissors specifically made for cardboard if you plan on cutting it often. An inexpensive pair is a good choice because they won't cost you too much to replace when they become dull. Remove the excess cardboard around the circle. If you have a lot of cardboard around the circle you want to cut, it will be more difficult to guide your scissors around the circle.

If you want a negative space circle (a piece of cardboard with a hole cut in it that's perfectly circular), carefully stab one side of the scissors through the center of the circle to start making your cut.

Go between 2 of the sections you cut and start moving around the circle with your scissors. The sections will fall off as you do. Cut all the way around, and you have your circle. Working with a Craft Knife Pick a very sharp craft or box cutter. A box cutter or contractor's knife will work well for thick cardboard. A craft knife or scalpel-type knife is better for thinner cuts. Either way, the blade needs to be very sharp to cut through the cardboard. Make sure to work over a surface you don't mind cutting, such as a self-healing cutting mat. Cut around the circle in small strokes.
