  "text":" Regular Octagon Draw a large circle at the center of the page.  Draw a straight horizontal line splitting the circle to equal parts.  Draw a straight vertical line (also splitting the circle to equal parts) of which its center will intersect with that of the horizontal line.  Draw a straight diagonal line (northwest to southeast) that will also intersect at the center, dividing equally the space between the horizontal and vertical lines.  Draw another diagonal line (northeast to southwest) that will also intersect at the center, dividing equally the space between the horizontal and vertical lines. By now you will have an image resembling an eight-spoke wheel. Connect the tips of these spokes with straight lines.  Erase the circle, leaving behind the newly formed octagon.  Erase the lines inside the octagon.  You now have a regular octagon! Color the drawing as desired. Multiple Octagon Draw a square at the center of the page.  Draw straight lines that will connect one corner to its direct opposite corner.  Note the length between the center point (where the lines intersects) towards one of the square's corners. On each of the square's corners, use this length as the radius as you draw a circle, using the square's corner as the circle's center. You will end up with a flower-like image. Notice the point where the circle and square intersects. Connect these points with straight lines to form the octagon. Remove the square shape, leaving behind the circles, the lines that intersected, and the newly formed octagon. Use the lines (now forming an \u201cX\u201d) and the circle's intersections as your guide in making multiple and smaller octagons within the initial octagon. Erase the \u201cX\u201d shape.  Erase the circles.  You now have multiple octagons! Color the drawing if desired.",
