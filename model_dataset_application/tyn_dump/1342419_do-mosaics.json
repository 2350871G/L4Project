          "description":"You can make a mosaic on nearly any surface. It should be strong enough to handle the weight of your mosaic pieces and the glue and grout. Tables, planters, bird baths, or walking stones are all great options. Be sure to clean off any dirt or debris from your base before you use it. Use a damp sponge to scrub off any stubborn debris. Dry the base completely before you start applying the mosaic pieces to it. Your base can be any shape, but be careful with very extreme curves because you will need very small mosaic tiles to fill the curves. The best mosaic base for outdoor mosaics is concrete because it is the most weather-resistant. You can find thin concrete boards at your local building material store. A mesh metal pizza tray works especially well for making decorative glass gem mosaics. Terracotta bases are more risky for outdoor mosaics since they can be susceptible to freezing damage. If you want to make a mosaic on a terra cotta pot, for example, either take the pot inside in cold weather or apply several coats of sealant when you are finished to protect it from the elements."

          "headline":"Select the material you want to use to make your mosaic design.",
          "description":"The small pieces of material used in a mosaic art are called tesserae. They can be glass, stones, porcelain, seashells, or anything else you can find. If you don\u2019t have any material lying around your house, try buying mosaic tiles in your local arts and crafts store. Consider the size of your mosaic base when collecting your mosaic pieces. If you are unsure, scatter the pieces across the base. They should be able to cover it fully. If you are reusing materials for your mosaic, be sure to clean off any dirt or debris with soap and water. Let them dry completely before you begin the project. You can also add other objects or decorations to your mosaic, like small ceramic flowers. You can also used smashed china plates as mosaic tiles. Break one plate at a time with a hammer inside a plastic bag. Use a tile nipper to break the plates for more control over the sizes and shapes of the pieces. You will need 5-7 plates for a medium-sized mosaic, about 20 by 24 inches (51 cm \u00d7 61 cm). Cups don\u2019t work as well for mosaics because they don\u2019t end up making flat pieces so they are harder to arrange and glue down. Round glass gems are a kid-friendly mosaic tile because you won\u2019t have to worry about sharp edges. You can find the gems in your local craft store. They are available in many different colors and sizes."

But you can also use acrylic based adhesives, epoxy resins, or construction adhesives. Find the right adhesive for you at your local craft supply or hardware store. Start by looking at the \u201cApplications\u201d section on the label. You will need an adhesive that works well for your base and decoration materials. If you are making an outdoor mosaic, make sure your adhesive label states that it is water-resistant. For mosaics that will regularly get wet, like shower floors, use thinset mortar. Acrylic-based adhesives are easy to use and very strong and good for slippery surfaces like ceramic and glass. Epoxy resins work well on metals, but they can be messy to use and smelly."

You can also put the adhesive directly on each mosaic tile as if you are buttering it like a piece of toast. Apply the buttered piece directly to the foundation and press down to affix it in place.

Make sure the gaps between the tiles are about \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) or less. If you are using concave mosaic pieces, like shells, coat the underside of the shell with adhesive and fill the body of the shell with adhesive before you place it on the base."

Once the adhesive is set, wipe the mosaic tiles with a damp sponge to clear away any extra adhesive material that may have risen to the top. Try to wipe the excess mortar as soon as possible after its set. If you wait until the adhesive cures completely (usually another 24 hours after it is set), it will be very difficult to wipe off the excess from the tiles. If you used traditional mortar, 24 hours is usually enough time for indoor mosaics. Outdoor mosaics will need to set for 72 hours. Acrylic adhesives and epoxy resins usually take between 12-24 hours to set completely."

Grout comes in many colors and you can even color the grout yourself to get the perfect match for your mosaic. It looks best if you pick a contrasting color so your design will stand out. If you used very textured or porous pieces, like shells or very uneven stones, you don\u2019t need to grout your mosaic. If you are in doubt about the grout color, black is usually the best choice, and pure white often drowns out the mosaic design. If you want a lighter color, try a cream-colored grout."

Rinse out the sponge regularly as you wipe away grout from the surface of the tiles. If there is any stubborn grout residue left on the mosaic, or if you wait too long after it sets to wipe it off, clean the excess grout off with a clean lint free cloth or a piece of crumpled newspaper.
