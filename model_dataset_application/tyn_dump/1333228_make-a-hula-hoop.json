This measurement is the diameter of your ideal beginner hoop if you have a normal BMI. If you are overweight or obese you can calculate your ideal hoop size by multiplying your waist in inches by (1.2). (39\"x1.2=45\" hoop). You then need to calculate its circumference to know how much tubing you need. (circumference = pi (\u03c0=3.14) times the diameter: c=\u03c0d). The average diameter of an adult hula hoop is 40\u201d, so the circumference is 40 x 3.14 = 126\u201d. The average diameter of a child\u2019s hula hoop is 28\u201d making the circumference about 28 x 3.14 = 88\u201d."
