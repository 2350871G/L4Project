Pads will help prevent the bottom of your furniture or other sharp parts from scraping or scratching against your laminate flooring. You can purchase pads made out of several different types of materials, like felt, plastic, carpet, and cane. You can purchase protector pads from most home improvement and flooring stores. Purchase protector pads, or discs, with adhesive on one side that you can stick to the bottom of your furniture. Periodically examine the felt protector pads you attached. The pads may need to be replaced when the felt becomes compressed due to regular wear of the furniture."
