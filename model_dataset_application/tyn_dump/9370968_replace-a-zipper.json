          "description":"The best way to shorten a zipper is to use a pair of strong scissors to cut across the bottom of the zipper. Identify how much you need to shorten the zipper and then mark your zipper fabric. Cut of the excess zipper by cutting straight across the zipper fabric and teeth. Make sure to install a new zipper pull stop if you shorten the zipper. A zipper pull stop goes at the bottom of your zipper and prevents the zipper pull from coming off when you unzip the zipper. You can get zipper pull stops in craft stores. They look like small rectangles with prongs extending from the sides. To install a new zipper pull stop, push the prongs into the fabric right below the last zipper teeth. Then, close the prongs on the backside with pliers. If needed, install a zipper pull stop on each side of the zipper so that you can still open it all the way."

For example, is the zipper material visible or hidden? Does the zipper material peak out from behind the raw edges of the item fabric a certain amount? If so, how much? Take note of anything you notice and take measurements as well. Record what you find to help you as you sew the new zipper into place."

Insert the long end of the seam ripper into the space between the zipper fabric and item fabric. When you do this, you should notice the thread separate. Keep repeating this with all of the threads holding your zipper in place. A seam ripper is the best tool for removing an old zipper because it allows you to cut the stitches holding the zipper in place without damaging your fabric. A seam ripper blade looks like a crescent, and it is designed this way so that you can easily catch the stitches and cut them without damaging your fabric. The seam ripper cuts the threads with the sharp area in the middle of the crescent."

For example, if you found that the zipper was attached so that the raw edges of the fabric were hidden, then you will need to attach the new zipper the same way.

Unzip the zipper and then line up the raw edges of one side of the zipper fabric with one side of the item fabric so that the zipper pull is facing towards the item fabric.

If you have a zipper foot, remove your universal foot and install the zipper foot now. Check your machine\u2019s manual for instructions on how to remove/install a foot.
