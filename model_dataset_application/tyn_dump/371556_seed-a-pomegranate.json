  "text":" Removing Seeds By Hand Open your pomegranate. Place the pomegranate on a cutting board and cut off the crown. After you have removed and disposed of the crown, slice your pomegranate along its ridges. This will prevent you from slicing through the seeds. The ridges separate the pomegranate sections. You can spot them from the top after you have removed the crown. One set of sections radiates from the top down, and a second section radiates from the side. Slice through both to open the pomegranate. Pull the open pomegranate apart. After you have cut through the top and side ridges, your pomegranate will fall into a star shape. Each individual slice will be attached to the center. Pull apart each side and prepare to remove the seeds. Remove the arils gently with your hands. Use your fingers in a gentle scraping motion to dislodge the arils from the pomegranate skin. Place the arils in a container. If you do not eat all the seeds at once, you can keep them in a sealed container for up to three days in the refrigerator. Removing Seeds in Water Fill a bowl of cold water. Chill the water before you prepare the pomegranate so you can soak it immediately. The colder the temperature, the looser the arils will be. If you chill the water with ice, remove any ice cubes before you soak the pomegranate. Score your pomegranate into four quarters. Cut off the pomegranate's top. Then, cut it into quarters. Make each quarter even so they soak for the same amount of time. Sharpen your knife before you score the pomegranate. Dull knives are both more time-consuming and dangerous. You'll get a cleaner, more accurate cut with a sharp knife. Soak the quarters in the cold water. For best results, keep the pomegranate fully submerged. Your pomegranate will be easier to seed as it gets colder. Run your fingers through each quarter slice and pull off the red outer skin. Expose the arils and the pomegranate skin, and remove the outer skin from the bowl. Keep a trash can nearby to discard the skin quickly. Gently pry the seeds from the pomegranate skin. Keep the quarters submerged underwater as you do so for easier seeding. Nudge the seeds out of the skin to avoid them bursting open. After you have separated all the seeds from the skin, discard the pomegranate skin. The skin should float to the top for easy removal. You should clean the seeds properly before eating. Scoop the seeds up and place them in a bowl. Let the seeds dry for five minutes before you eat them. Removing Seeds With a Spoon Slice your pomegranate in half. Using a sharp knife, cut the pomegranate in two equal halves. You do not have to be precise, but try to be even. Set both halves on the counter, face down. Hit the pomegranate halves on the back with a wooden spoon. Continue hitting the pomegranate until all the seeds fall out. Whack the pomegranate hard to dislodge many seeds at once. For most pomegranates, three or four whacks is sufficient. If your seeds remain stuck, hit harder or use a larger spoon. Dig out remaining arils with a smaller spoon. After you have whacked the pomegranate halves, most seeds should be dislodged. To remove remaining seeds, use a smaller spoon and dig out any seeds left inside.",
