For irregularly-shaped areas like closets, alcoves, and counters, multiply the length and width of the extra space separately, then add this number to the square footage of the main part of the room. If you're measuring a rectangular room that's 18 square feet (1.7 m) x 12 square feet (1.1 m), for example, the total square footage would be 216 square feet (20.1 m). Figuring out the room's square footage will tell you exactly how much tile you'll need for your flooring project, which may influence the size and style you go with."

You\u2019ll need to know their exact length and width in order to determine how many will fit within the floor space of the room you\u2019re tiling.
