In general, avoid purchasing pre-packaged beef for your burgers.Why fresh-ground beef?It\u2019s juicier and tastier. Frozen and pre-packaged ground beef often has freezer burn\u2014ice crystals form within the meat, decreasing the flavorful juices you love in your burger.

By buying fresh, you know the quality you\u2019re getting.Find fresh-ground beef at the butcher, or the meat counter at your grocery store. If you have a local butcher, head there for the freshest cuts of beef. You can also see if the meat counter at your local grocery store will grind up some fresh beef for you.You can freeze fresh beef yourself. Wrap the beef tightly in waxy butcher or freezer paper and tape it shut, then wrap a layer of aluminum foil over that. Tape it shut, write the date on the package, and cook it within 4 months. To defrost, leave it in the fridge until completely thawed. If you\u2019re short on time, take the meat out of the wrap and place it under cool running water for 20 minutes to an hour."

You can buy ground beef at any supermarket.l If you prefer organic meat, check the organic section or a health food grocery store.Understanding Beef LabelsCheck the percentage of the meat. Most beef is labeled with 2 percentages, telling you how much lean meat and how much fat is present in the cut. This is the most accurate way to tell what the lean to fat ratio is, so should be your go-to when buying.Look at the name, or cut, of the meat. Your meat may be labeled base on what part of the cow it came from. If the cut is labeled but a percentage is not given, you can go by the following general guidelines to tell the lean to fat ratio:Hamburger (can come from any part): 73% lean, 27% fatGround chuck: 80% lean, 20% fatGround round: 85% lean, 15% fatGround sirloin: 90% lean, 10% fatLean ground beef: 95% lean, 5%fatSee how red the meat is.

    "Once will be enough.",
    "Watch the side of the burgers to see how done they are.",
    "If you cut into a burger to see when it\u2019s done, you\u2019ll risk losing some of the juiciness you\u2019ve worked hard to preserve.",
    "Instead, take a close look at the sides of a burger.",
    "If there\u2019s a slight line of pink in the middle of the side, the burger is medium-rare.",
    "If the sides are all browned, the burger is medium.",
    "Serve the burgers when they\u2019re medium-rare or medium.",
    "As the burgers continue to cook, more juice will cook out of them.",
    "Ensure that you\u2019ll have a juicy, flavorful burger by serving the patty when it\u2019s medium-rare or medium.",
    "Set the burger on a bun, and garnish with tomato, lettuce, mustard, ketchup, and whatever else you choose.",
    "Grilling Juicy Burgers Pre-heat the grill before applying your burgers.",
    "Heat two separate regions of the grill: one to be a high-heat zone at about 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C).",
    "Set the other as a low-heat zone, about 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C).",
    "Let the grill pre-heat for 15 minutes before you apply the patties.",
    "Oil the grill as it pre-heats.",
    "While the grill is warming up, drizzle some olive oil onto a paper towel.",
    "Rub the paper towel along the surface of the grill to lubricate it.",
    "This will help your patties cook evenly and prevent them from sticking to the grill as they brown.",
    "Set your patties on the high-heat side of the grill for about 2 minutes.",
    "The intense heat of the grill will create a delicious browned crust on either side of the burger, which adds to the rich flavor of the meat.",
    "If you were to leave the burger over high heat, the temperature would dry out the interior of the burger and eventually overcook the whole patty.",
    "Flip the burgers after about 2 minutes.",
    "After the burgers have cooked for about 2 minutes on the high-heat side of the grill, use a spatula to flip them over.",
    "When flipping the burgers, keep them at a distance of about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from each other.",
    "If the burgers are too close together, they may cook unevenly or fuse together while cooking.",
    "Move the patties over to the low-heat side once they\u2019re browned on both sides.",
    "Once both sides of the burgers are evenly browned, use your spatula to gingerly lift the patties and move them to the low-heat side of the grill.",
    "Keep a close eye on the cooking burgers so that you can remove them from the grill when they\u2019re as done as you\u2019d like them to be.",
    "Cook the burgers for 3-4 minutes on the low-heat side.",
    "Here, their juicy insides will continue to cook without getting dried out or burnt.",
    "Use the full surface of the low-heat side of your grill to keep the burgers from touching one another.",
    "Flip the burgers at about the 2-minute mark.",
    "This will ensure that all of the patties are evenly cooked through on both sides.",
    "Remove the burgers when they\u2019re medium-rare to medium 130\u2013140 \u00b0F (54\u201360 \u00b0C).",
    "Evaluate how cooked the burgers are by paying attention to their size and firmness.",
    "Burgers will shrink and tighten up as they cook.",
    "A rare burger will still be juicy if lightly pressed with a spatula, and will be soft and slightly squishy.",
    "If you\u2019re using a meat thermometer, a rare burger will be about 125 \u00b0F (52 \u00b0C) .",
    "A medium-well burger will be about 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C) .",
    "If you cook your burger to a higher temperature, it will no longer be juicy."
