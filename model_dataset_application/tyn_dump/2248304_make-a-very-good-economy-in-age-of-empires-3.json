Gold is unimportant at the start of the game because in a normal game, gold is not needed at the start besides 50 gold for hunting dogs upgrade. Collect food from animals, this is important: Try to collect food from animals first and don't build Mills, they use up too much wood. While Aging to the next era, you should balance your villagers between food, gold and maybe wood (depends on what kind of army are you going to make), Also build a market and buy all the upgrades on the market for food and the first for wood and gold, this way you will have a solid eco early game. ."

Don't stop making villagers for any reason, make soldiers to defend your villagers and maybe cavalry to harass the oponnent's economy raiding their villagers."

If you are going to boom with villagers you'll have to build 2 more TCs (Tower Center) that will cost 1200 wood (you can collect it before while aging). Make some walls to defend your base and get some Archers or Skirmishers behind it to help defend your boom.Try having many villagers and it really pays off because you will get many resources fast. Upgrade your troops, this is important. Now you will need more gold. Plantation is good but not as fast as gold-mines and are too expensive. So you want to use the mines.

Try having just enough villagers collecting wood because it's the slowest resource to gather or if you need more wood buy the 3rd upgrade on the market sooner. For gold you can use about 10 to 15 villagers or more if your army is gold heavy on the cost."
