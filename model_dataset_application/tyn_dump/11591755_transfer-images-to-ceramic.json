Check your printer\u2019s product manual to see if there are any settings adjustments you should make when using specialty papers such as transfer paper. Transfer paper has an opaque backing that can be peeled away when the sheet is soaked in warm water, leaving behind a transparent film that can be applied to materials like ceramic and glass. You do not have to print images in mirror image mode (reverse mode) when using transfer paper. The clear film portion of the transfer paper adheres directly to the ceramic item, image side up, so the image does not need to be reversed. Color or black and white images, as well as low-resolution or high-resolution images, all work well using this technique. Just make sure to resize the image if necessary so that it fits properly on the ceramic piece you've selected."
