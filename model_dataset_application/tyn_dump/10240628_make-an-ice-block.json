A good go-to size for an ice block is 10.16 x 43.18 x 43.18 cm (4 x 17 x 17 in). Try to find a box with similar dimensions. At the very least, your block should have a surface area of 30 x 40 cm (11.81 x 15.75 in). Keep in mind that the water will be heavy when it freezes, so you don\u2019t want to pick a box that\u2019s going to be too large and thus too heavy to pick up once it\u2019s frozen. Cardboard boxes are best because they tend to be able to handle the expansion of the water when it freezes into ice. In contrast, plastic boxes might crack."
