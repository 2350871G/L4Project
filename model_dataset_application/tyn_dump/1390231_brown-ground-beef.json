          "description":"Fresh ground beef doesn\u2019t need to be thawed, but frozen ground beef should be moved to the refrigerator before you need to cook it. Keep it wrapped in its original packaging. The cool temperature protects it from bacteria as it unfreezes, so you can keep the ground beef in there for up to 2 days after defrosting. If you need to thaw larger packages of beef, give them additional time in the refrigerator. For example, a 2 lb (0.91 kg) package of beef needs to be in the refrigerator for 2 days. If you are in a hurry, move the beef to the microwave. Use a defrost setting or set your microwave to 50% power. Gradually heat the meat until it is no longer icy but still cold. Another way to defrost is with cold water in your sink. Keep your beef in its plastic wrapping or move it to a watertight container. Submerge the beef, changing out the water every 30 minutes. Keep doing this until the beef is cool but not icy."

If you have a nonstick pan, spraying the pan isn\u2019t necessary, but it can still be helpful. Make sure you fully coat a frying pan big enough to hold all of the meat you wish to cook. Your pan needs to provide plenty of space so you can move the beef around. If you are cooking more than 1 lb (0.45 kg) at a time, you may need to cook the beef in batches. Instead of cooking spray, you can add up to 2  tsp (9.9 mL) of a cooking oil to the pan. This is useful for lean beef or nonstick pans."

When the pan is hot enough, the water will evaporate immediately. That means your pan is ready for the beef. A cold pan won\u2019t cook the beef properly. The beef will begin losing juices without browning and turn gray. Remember that adding cold beef lowers the pan\u2019s temperature, so heat the pan well before cooking."

Let it cook for at least 2 or 3 minutes so it turns a nice, even brown on 1 side. When you notice the edges crisping, you know the beef is ready to be flipped. Infrequent stirring ensures that all sides of the beef get a chance to brown evenly. Ground beef cooks very quickly, so don\u2019t walk away from your stove. Avoid adding water to the pan unless you want gray, steamed beef. If you wish to use water, add \u20444  c (59 mL) for every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of beef you cook."

Make sure all of the beef is flipped over onto its pink side, then let it cook for another 2 or 3 minutes. Ground beef breaks apart easily, so stirring it in the pan isn\u2019t much of a challenge despite the short cooking time. Now is a good time to sprinkle the beef with a generous amount of salt to draw out additional flavor."

Cook the beef for a minute or 2 before stirring and checking again. Ensure the meat is fully cooked by checking the temperature with a thermometer. All pieces should be at least 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C). Ground beef takes approximately 7 to 10 minutes to cook all the way through, although this varies depending on your stove. Turning the beef often ensures that 1 section doesn\u2019t stay directly on the pan for too long and burn."

You can spoon the beef into the colander with a slotted spoon to avoid picking up most of the juice in the pan. Dump the fat into the trash once it cools. Another way to do this is to set out some paper towels on a plate. Lay the beef on the paper towels, then use another paper towel to dab the beef dry.

Get a shallow, circular container if you can, since the shape helps the beef cook more evenly. Choose a dish large enough to hold all of the beef or microwave it in separate batches if necessary. A metal steamer basket or colander can be effective for microwaving ground beef. You can also place the beef in a bowl set in the basket or colander to automatically drain fat.

You shouldn\u2019t have any trouble pressing the beef down by hand or with a spoon. Break the beef into smaller chunks as needed to distribute it evenly across your container. If the beef is hard to break apart, defrost it in the microwave at a low temperature for about 2 minutes, then try again.

High temperatures tend to leave the edges of the beef piping hot and the center stone cold, similar to that frozen pizza pocket you may have tried heating once. You can adjust the settings if you wish. Microwaving on a high heat setting is fine, but be cautious. Make sure the beef reaches a safe temperature before you use it.
