Adding a suitable thinner will allow more viscous paint to flow freely through the siphon tube, metering valve (fluid) assembly, and nozzle. Prepare the area where you will paint. Place a drop cloth, sheet plastic, scrap lumber or other material on the ground, floor, or any furniture.

Protect nearby surfaces from \"over spray\" with masking or painter's tape and painter's paper or newspapers; in windy, outdoor conditions, airborne paint particles may drift farther than you expect.

You can use the sprayer to apply the primer (following the steps below as if it were paint) or apply it with a brush or roller. When you\u2019re done, sand it smooth if needed. Prep the Compressor Turn on the air compressor. You will use some air for priming and testing your sprayer, so let it build up pressure while you get your paint ready.

Adjust the regulator on the compressor to between 12 and 25 PSI (pounds per square inch). The exact amount will vary depending on your sprayer, so look at the manual (or the equipment itself) for details. Attach the air hose coupling to the sprayer. Make sure it is tight; you may want to wrap the threads with Teflon tape to insure an airtight seal. This does not apply if your sprayer and hose are equipped with quick connect couplings. Pour a small amount of paint thinner into the paint cup. (This is the reservoir attached to the bottom of your spray gun.) Use just enough to submerge the siphon tube in it. Open the metering valve slightly. This is usually the lower of two screws above the handle (pistol grip) of the sprayer. Prime the sprayer. Aim the nozzle into a waste bucket and squeeze the trigger. It usually takes a few seconds for the sprayer system to prime with liquid, so at first, only air will come out of the nozzle. After a moment, you should get a flow of paint thinner.

A funnel helps, here, so you can return it to the original container. Mineral spirits and turpentine (two common thinners) are flammable solvents, and should only be stored in their original containers. Paint Mix enough paint to do your project.
