    "If you\u2019re not planning to eat the burgers right away, seal them in a container and put them in the refrigerator.",
    "When you\u2019re ready to eat them, put them on the grill until the internal temperature reads 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C).",
    "Do not allow the internal temperature of the burgers to drop below 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C) before putting them in the fridge.",

    "Cooking Turkey Burgers Plug in the grill to begin preheating for 5 minutes.",

    "Gently stir everything together with your fingers, mixing the ingredients only until everything is evenly incorporated.",
    "Wear food-safe disposable gloves if you prefer not to put your hands into raw meat.",
    "Create 4 patties of equal size and thickness with your palms.",
    "Pick up one-fourth of the mixture and gently roll it between your palms until it forms a sphere.",
    "Then, gently squeeze the ball between your palms until it forms a patty that\u2019s between 0.25\u20130.5 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) thick and 4\u20135 in (10\u201313 cm) in diameter.",
    "Put the finished patty on a clean plate.",
    "Repeat the process to make 3 more patties.",
    "Make turkey burger patties a bit thinner than beef patties, since it\u2019s important for the interior to cook through completely.",
    "Lift the grill lid and space out the patties on the lower grill plate.",
    "The grill is ready for the turkey burgers once it has preheated for 5 minutes.",
    "Give the patties 0.25 in (0.64 cm) of spacing on the grill plate.",
    "Depending on your grill model, you may only be able to make 2 patties at a time.",
    "Make the burgers in 2 batches if you can\u2019t fit all 4 patties on the grill at once.",
    "Wash your hands with soap and water after handling raw meat.",

    "Repeat the process as needed.",
    "Turkey burgers may take up to 8 minutes to cook completely.",
    "Don\u2019t worry about flipping the burgers\u2014the grill cooks both sides evenly at the same time.",

    "Use the spatula that came with the grill to lift the patties onto a clean plate lined with paper towels.",
    "Stick a probe thermometer into the center of each patty.",
    "If the internal temperature is below 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C), put the patties back on the grill and recheck them after 30 or 60 seconds.",
    "Do not undercook ground turkey.",
    "The chance for foodborne illness is too great if the meat isn\u2019t fully cooked to 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C).",
    "Don\u2019t reuse the plate that you put the raw patties on without washing it first.",

    "The \u201cdanger zone\u201d for foodborne illnesses from cooked meats is 40\u2013140 \u00b0F (4\u201360 \u00b0C).",
    "Don\u2019t let the cooked burgers fall below 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C) without refrigerating them, and keep them at below 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C) until you\u2019re ready to reheat them.",
    "Cooking Frozen Burgers Choose frozen burger patties that are no more than 0.5 in (1.3 cm) thick.",
    "A thicker frozen burger may overcook on the outside before it cooks through on the inside.",
    "While fresh burger patties cook best on a Foreman grill in the 0.5\u20130.75 in (1.3\u20131.9 cm) range, opt for thinner burgers when cooking straight from frozen.",
    "If your frozen burgers are more than 0.5 in (1.3 cm) thick, thaw them first before cooking them.",
    "Either put up to 1 lb (450 g) of burgers in the fridge in an airtight container for 5 hours, or in a watertight bag in a bowl of cool water for 30-60 minutes.",
    "Follow the cooking instructions for fresh burgers instead of frozen burgers.",

    "Make sure the grease tray is in position on the countertop at the base of the lower grill plate.",
    "Read the instruction manual for your grill before using it for the first time.",
    "Place 2-4 frozen patties on the lower grill plate.",
    "The number of burgers you can cook at once depends on the diameter of the patties and the model of your Foreman grill.",
    "Make sure the patties don\u2019t overhang the lower plate, and aim to give at least 0.25 in (0.64 cm) of spacing between patties.",
    "The plates of the preheated grill are very hot, so work carefully.",
    "Consider putting the burgers on with tongs that are both nonstick surface-safe and heat-resistant.",
    "Close the lid and cook the burgers for 4.5-6.5 minutes.",
    "Lower the lid so that the top plate makes contact with the top of the patties.",
    "Keep the lid closed for 4.5 minutes before checking the burgers for doneness.",
    "Check every 30 seconds until they look done on the outside, which may take up to 6.5 minutes.",
    "Frozen burgers usually take about 90 seconds longer to cook than fresh patties, which take about 3-5 minutes.",
    "No flipping necessary!",
    "The grill plates cook both sides at the same time.",
    "Remove the burgers and test the internal temperature for doneness.",
    "Lift the lid and use the spatula that came with the grill to lift the burgers onto a paper towel-lined plate.",
    "Insert a meat thermometer into the center of each burger patty.",
    "If the temperature reads below 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C), put the patties back on the grill until they reach that temperature.",
    "At this internal temperature, the burgers are at medium doneness.",
    "Even if you like fresh burgers less well done, cook commercially-frozen patties to this temperature for safety reasons.",
    "Unplug the grill when you\u2019re finished.",
    "Eat the burgers before the internal temperature falls below 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C).",
    "Since these are frozen patties, cook only what you intend to eat right away.",
    "Serve them on a bun and with your favorite condiments within 5 minutes of cooking them.",
    "Either refrigerate or discard the burgers if the internal temperature falls below 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C).",
    "Cooked meats must be kept either above 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C) or below 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C) to reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses."
