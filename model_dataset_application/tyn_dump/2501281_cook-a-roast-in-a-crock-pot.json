To save time, you may use baby carrots or carrots pre-cut into \"coins\" instead of whole carrots. Substitute roughly 5 to 8 baby carrots or 1/2 cup (125 ml) pre-cut coins per regular whole carrot. The onion can also be cut into quarters or minced. The flavor of  the gravy will not be dramatically affected either way, so how you cut the onions is mainly a matter of aesthetic taste. Substitute dried onion flakes or onion powder for the fresh onion, if desired. This step saves time and also makes it possible to get the onion flavor while hiding the actual onion from picky eaters. Use 1/4 cup (60 ml) dried onion flakes or 1 tsp (5 ml) onion powder."

Cooking the Roast Layer the carrots and onions in the bottom of your crock pot. Place the carrots into the slow cooker first, followed by the onions. Use a 4-quart (4-liter) crock pot, at minimum. A 5- to 6-quart (5- to 6-liter) slow cooker would be even better. You need enough space for the lid to sit securely on the cooker, but the crock pot must be at least halfway filled.

Finishing the Gravy Remove about 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) broth from the crock pot. Wait until after the roast and vegetables have been removed and use a ladle to transfer the liquid into a small saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stovetop. Turn the burner on to medium heat. Remove 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of broth from the saucepan. Ladle the liquid into a small bowl. Mix cornstarch into the bowl. Use a whisk or fork to blend the cornstarch into the 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of broth already in the bowl. Blend until smooth. Add the cornstarch mixture to the rest of the broth. Stir it in with a fork or spoon until evenly distributed. Simmer until thickened. Once the liquid starts to bubble after a minute or two, reduce the heat and continue stirring an additional few minutes as it thickens. Serve with the roast.
