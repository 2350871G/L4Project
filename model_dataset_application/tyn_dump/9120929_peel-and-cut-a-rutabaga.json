  "text":" Slicing the Rutabaga Wash the rutabaga. Just as you would with any vegetable, you should thoroughly wash the rutabaga in water before you begin chopping. Be sure to remove any dirt (as rutabagas are root vegetables). Remove the top and bottom and cut the rutabaga in half. Place your rutabaga on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, remove the hard top and hard bottom of the vegetable. Discard these pieces. Then slice the entire rutabaga in half lengthwise. Cut each half into \u00bd inch (1.27 cm) semi-circles. Lying one half of the rutabaga on its flat side, carefully slice it into about \u00bd inch (1.27 cm) semi-circles. Repeat this process with the other half. Peeling and Chopping the Rutabaga Remove the outer skin with a paring knife. Pick up one slice of rutabaga and hold it in your non-dominant hand. Then, take out a paring knife and hold it in your dominant hand. Place the edge of your knife against the rutabaga, facing toward you, and apply pressure to the rutabaga with your thumb. Slide the knife along the rutabaga slice toward you, removing the skin. Discard the skin and repeat with the remaining slices. The outer skin of the rutabaga is thick and tough. For this reason, a traditional vegetable peeler may not work and a paring knife is recommended. Cut each piece into 1 inch (2.54 cm) cubes. With the skin removed, you can now chop your rutabaga. Whether you will be boiling, roasting, or baking this vegetable, you will most likely need it to be in cubes. Take out your sharp knife and cut each slice into 1 inch (2.54 cm) cubes. Repeat with the remaining slices. Cover cubes in salted water until ready to use. Place your rutabaga cubes into a bowl and cover them with water. Sprinkle the water with a bit of salt and give it a stir. This will keep your rutabaga fresh until you are ready to use it.",
