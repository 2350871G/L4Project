It\u2019s also a good idea to keep a few spare sheets of paper handy just in case you mess up and want to start over. A pencil is much better suited for this project than a pen, as you\u2019ll have more control over your lines.

That way, you\u2019ll be able to use it as a visual aid and have something to compare your drawing to as you work. Take a few moments to study your photo in depth before you get started. Familiarizing yourself with a many details as possible will help you reproduce the image more faithfully and keep you from having to stop and look at it every few seconds.Tip: Turning the color saturation in your source photo down to zero could help you translate it better to paper, since it will be closer in appearance to your final drawing."

          "description":"Use short, light pencil strokes to gradually develop the shape of the person or object in your photo. Do your best to keep the proportions of your drawing the same as those in the original image. Scaling each individual part of your sketch so that it\u2019s roughly the same size as your photo can help. Don\u2019t bear down too hard. You can always go back and make your lines thicker and darker once you\u2019re happy with the way they look. Another useful technique is to section off both your paper and original photo into identically-sized squares, then zero in and focus on copying only what you see in each square. You can start your outline wherever it feels most natural to you. As a rule, it\u2019s just easier to start with the basic form before moving on to smaller details, rather than vice-versa."

          "description":"Once you\u2019ve completed your outline, flesh it out with that give your subject its unique character. If you\u2019re drawing a person, this will include things like their facial features, hair, and clothing. If you\u2019re bringing to life a nature scene, it might mean adding rippling water, leaves, clouds. As you did with the outline, try to match the proportions of your drawing to those of your photo, and keep your lines light and loose until you\u2019re ready to commit to them. The idea here is essentially just to recreate the kinds of lines, shapes, and contours you see in the original image onto your paper. This requires a keen eye and a steady hand more than anything else."

          "description":"There are a number of ways to shade a drawing. The simplest and most common method is to hold your pencil at a narrow angle to the paper and rub the side over broad areas. Apply more pressure in areas with deep shadows and lighten up when you get to spots that are meant to represent glare or light colors. You can also give techniques like hatching (drawing straight, parallel lines close together), cross-hatching (crossing your hatching lines perpendicularly to produce a gridlike pattern), and stippling (making small dots with the tip of your pencil) a shot for parts of your drawing where conventional shading may not look right. Shading is a crucially important artistic skill to possess if your goal is to make your drawings more lifelike."

Tracing paper is thinner and more translucent than normal paper, which makes it possible to easily trace over the picture below. Alternatively, you can use a regular sheet of printer paper (or any other type of paper you want) and light both the photograph and your paper from underneath with an art projector.

Take your time and work carefully to avoid mistakes. Some smaller details may not be visible on your tracing paper. This usually happens when part of the picture is especially light or made up of thin lines.Tip: Equip yourself with a hard-tipped 3H-H grade artist\u2019s pencil to ensure that your lines come out clean and precise. Softer pencils are prone to smearing and smudging when used on tracing paper."

Open the menu and scan the list of render modes until you see \u201cSaturation,\u201d then click this option. You may notice the contrast of your image change slightly when you apply Saturation mode. Switch your second layer to \u201cDodge\u201d mode. Now, click on the first of the two duplicate layers (the second layer in the list) and navigate back up to the \u201cMode\u201d menu at the top of the Layers panel. Open the drop-down menu and change the render mode of this layer to \u201cDodge.\u201d\nDodge mode will reduce the exposure of your image, flattening the and coaxing more detail out of dark spots. This effect will give the lines in your final \u201cdrawing\u201d a rougher, sketchier look. Invert the colors of your second layer. Go back up to the \u201cColors\u201d tab on the top toolbar and select \u201cInvert.\u201d Doing so will cause most of the black tones to vanish from your image, leaving a mostly white screen. You\u2019re almost there! If your image doesn\u2019t turn white when you click \u201cInvert,\u201d you may have applied the effect to the wrong layer. Hit \u201cCtrl+Z\u201d to undo the action and try again, being sure to select the middle layer in the list. Apply the \u201cGaussian Blur\u201d filter to the inverted layer. Go up to the \u201cFilters\u201d tab on the top toolbar and select the \u201cGaussian Blur\u201d filter. A settings window for the filter will appear, allowing you to control the filter\u2019s effects. Set the blur radius for both the horizontal and vertical dimensions somewhere between 10 and 30, then click \u201cOK.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to begin, start a blur radius of 10 and slowly increase one or both values.Tip: The ideal blur radius setting will differ depending on the size and resolution of your image. You may need to play around with the numbers a bit in order to get your image looking the way you want it. Adjust the color levels of your third layer for a more detailed image. If you feel a little underwhelmed with your digital drawing after applying the Gaussian Blur filter, there is a way you can tweak it a bit more. Select your second duplicate layer (the third one in the list), then head up to the \u201cColors\u201d tab on the top toolbar and click the \u201cLevels\u201d option. You can then slide the small arrows at the bottom of the Input Levels box to the left or right to alter the depth of the image\u2019s black and white tones. After making your final edits, right-click your original layer and use the \u201cMerge Layers\u201d function to bring all of your layers together into a single image. Don\u2019t forget to save a copy of your image in your preferred file format when you\u2019re done! Using Free Apps and Websites Download a photo editor program or app. Don't worry if a high-end photo editor like Photoshop or GIMP isn't within your budget or skillset. There are also lots of free apps and websites out there that will let you start experimenting with your photos in minutes. Most of these apps are easy to use, with intuitive controls and a number of tools that allow for greater customization. Photo Lab, Paint, Enlight Photofox, Prisma, and Clip2Comic are all free apps that boast a wide range of filters and effects meant to emulate traditional art styles. If you\u2019re surfing the web, check out popular photo editing sites like Pixlr and Paint.NET. There\u2019s no need to use a fancy photo editor if you just want to play around. These days, the newer version of many common programs, like Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, feature their own built-in photo effects. Choose a photo to turn into a drawing. Select an image file from your device\u2019s camera roll or your computer harddrive. You can use any photo you like. However, you\u2019ll get the best results from clear, well-framed photos that have a definite subject and aren\u2019t too busy. Photos that contain lots of small details could end up looking muddled or confusing once you apply certain filters or effects.Tip: The picture you upload doesn\u2019t have to be of a person. You can also use your photo editor of choice to transform nature shots, still lifes, or even snaps of food you\u2019ve cooked. Locate the program\u2019s \u201cEffects\u201d feature. Most photo editors have a tab near the top of the screen that says something like \u201cEffects,\u201d \u201cFilters,\u201d or \u201cStylize.\u201d If you\u2019re using a mobile app, you\u2019ll usually be able to find the function you\u2019re looking for by tapping the \u201cEdit\u201d button. Apps that are designed specifically to make photos look like drawings often display all of their effects options right on the main page. Apply the effect you want to use and try out different looks. Once you\u2019ve pulled up a list of the editor\u2019s effects options, you can tap or click freely on any of them that catch your eye. See how your photo looks as a basic black and white sketch, or perhaps a colorful cartoon or watercolor if you want to preserve the picture\u2019s original hues. When you\u2019re satisfied, tap or click the \u201cSave\u201d button to download a copy of the edited image. Some editors also have more specialized sorts of art effects to choose from, such as retro-fied comic book stippling, vibrant pop art, and subtle charcoal painting. Sketching Your Photo by Hand Grab a sheet of paper and a pencil. These two items are all you\u2019ll need to create a simple sketch. Sharpen your pencil to a nice fine point, and make sure you\u2019ve got at least one dedicated eraser. It\u2019s also a good idea to keep a few spare sheets of paper handy just in case you mess up and want to start over. A pencil is much better suited for this project than a pen, as you\u2019ll have more control over your lines. The eraser will also allow you to correct and draw back over any mistakes you happen to make. Keep your photo handy for reference. Pull up the photo you want to sketch on your device or computer, or keep a physical copy next to your piece of paper. That way, you\u2019ll be able to use it as a visual aid and have something to compare your drawing to as you work. Take a few moments to study your photo in depth before you get started. Familiarizing yourself with a many details as possible will help you reproduce the image more faithfully and keep you from having to stop and look at it every few seconds.Tip: Turning the color saturation in your source photo down to zero could help you translate it better to paper, since it will be closer in appearance to your final drawing. Start by sketching out the outline of your subject. Use short, light pencil strokes to gradually develop the shape of the person or object in your photo. Do your best to keep the proportions of your drawing the same as those in the original image. Scaling each individual part of your sketch so that it\u2019s roughly the same size as your photo can help. Don\u2019t bear down too hard. You can always go back and make your lines thicker and darker once you\u2019re happy with the way they look. Another useful technique is to section off both your paper and original photo into identically-sized squares, then zero in and focus on copying only what you see in each square. You can start your outline wherever it feels most natural to you. As a rule, it\u2019s just easier to start with the basic form before moving on to smaller details, rather than vice-versa. Fill in smaller details. Once you\u2019ve completed your outline, flesh it out with that give your subject its unique character. If you\u2019re drawing a person, this will include things like their facial features, hair, and clothing. If you\u2019re bringing to life a nature scene, it might mean adding rippling water, leaves, clouds. As you did with the outline, try to match the proportions of your drawing to those of your photo, and keep your lines light and loose until you\u2019re ready to commit to them. The idea here is essentially just to recreate the kinds of lines, shapes, and contours you see in the original image onto your paper. This requires a keen eye and a steady hand more than anything else. Shade your sketch for added realism. There are a number of ways to shade a drawing. The simplest and most common method is to hold your pencil at a narrow angle to the paper and rub the side over broad areas. Apply more pressure in areas with deep shadows and lighten up when you get to spots that are meant to represent glare or light colors. You can also give techniques like hatching (drawing straight, parallel lines close together), cross-hatching (crossing your hatching lines perpendicularly to produce a gridlike pattern), and stippling (making small dots with the tip of your pencil) a shot for parts of your drawing where conventional shading may not look right. Shading is a crucially important artistic skill to possess if your goal is to make your drawings more lifelike. Tracing Over Your Photo Place a piece of tracing paper over the photograph you want to draw. Line up the edges of the paper with the edges of the photo and make sure it\u2019s lying smooth and flat. Tracing paper is thinner and more translucent than normal paper, which makes it possible to easily trace over the picture below. Alternatively, you can use a regular sheet of printer paper (or any other type of paper you want) and light both the photograph and your paper from underneath with an art projector. For best results, it\u2019s important to use a type of paper that\u2019s at least as big as the photo you\u2019re working with, preferably larger. Stick strips of tape over the corners of your paper. This will prevent the paper from sliding around on top of the photograph. To avoid tearing the delicate tracing paper accidentally, use a low-hold type of tape, like masking tape. Be careful not to position the tape too close to the center of the paper, or it could get in your way once you start tracing. Guide your pencil along the features outlined on your tracing paper. Follow each main line and contour as closely as you can with the tip of your pencil. Use the edge to shade in darker sections and lend a sense of depth. Take your time and work carefully to avoid mistakes. Some smaller details may not be visible on your tracing paper. This usually happens when part of the picture is especially light or made up of thin lines.Tip: Equip yourself with a hard-tipped 3H-H grade artist\u2019s pencil to ensure that your lines come out clean and precise. Softer pencils are prone to smearing and smudging when used on tracing paper. Incorporate fine details or embellishments of your own. If you like, you can add a few extra touches to put your own personal stamp on your finished drawing. You might free-hand new features into the scene or take some artistic liberties with the shading or composition. It\u2019s totally up to you! Transfer your tracing paper to another photo to create a composite drawing made up of elements from different images.",
