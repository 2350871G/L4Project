Use a carpenter\u2019s square to check the each end to make sure they are perfectly squared so they will fit together evenly when you cut the dovetails. Tip: Use wood of 2 different colors or shades if you want to create a unique contrast between the pins and tails. Start with pieces of wood that are not curved or unevenly cut, so that the dovetails will fit tightly together."

Marking gauges have a small pin, known as a spur, that will create a light groove in the wood that you use as a guide for cutting.

For example, if you want 4 tails that are each \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wide, then set your divider to \u20442 in (1.3 cm).

A dovetail saw is a tenon saw with a small blade and fine teeth that is used specifically for cutting dovetails and other joints.

A set of chisels of various sizes will come in handy to cut different sizes of dovetails. You can get a set at a carpentry supply store or home hardware center.

Set the tail board against the end of the pin board at a 90-degree angle so that the tails are on top of the end of the pin board and you can trace the space between them. You will trace the space between the tails you already cut to mark the pins you need to cut. Set the pin board in a vice to hold it steady and make it easier to mark the end.
