Use a sharp paring or chef\u2019s knife to cut a little less than 1 centimetre (10 mm) off, then discard or compost the small nubs. Cutting off too much from the bottom might cause extra sprout leaves to fall off."

Pull off a few of the outermost leaves around the sprout, especially those that have brown or black spots. Discard these picked leaves in a compost bin. You can also bury these leaves in your garden and let them compost underground. If you found a lot of leaves that are dirty or blemished, wash all of the sprouts under cool water again."

Place this container in your refrigerator\u2019s crisper drawer and use them within 2 days for the freshest taste. Washing produce ahead of time decreases its shelf life even when you store it properly, so it\u2019s best to cook the sprouts right away."
