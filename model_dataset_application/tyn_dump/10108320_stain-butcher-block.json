Paint in long, even strokes that parallel the direction of the wood blocks. Give the conditioner at least 2 hours to dry. If you're using a water-based stain, use a water-based conditioner. Likewise, if you plan to use an oil-based stain, buy an oil-based conditioner. You can purchase wood conditioner at your local paint store. Butcher block is composed of many pieces of wood, each with their own distinct color. Applying wood conditioner before you stain will help all the pieces of wood take on a similar tone once the stain is applied."

  "text":" Sanding and Conditioning the Surface Sand the wood with coarse 80-grit sandpaper. Coarse sandpaper will remove any prior stains or varnishes from the butcher block, as well as any marks or scratches the wood has on the surface. Sand along the grain of the wood using long strokes. Sand the wood again with 150-grit sandpaper. As when using the coarse-grit paper, sand the surface using long strokes in the same direction as the wood grain. Fine-grit paper will remove any marks left by the coarse sandpaper and prepare the wood to receive the stain. Use a paper towel or clean rag to wipe off the dust left behind after sanding. Brush on 1 layer of wood conditioner. Use a 3 inches (7.6 cm) paintbrush to apply an even layer of conditioner across the entire surface of butcher block.

Likewise, if you plan to use an oil-based stain, buy an oil-based conditioner. You can purchase wood conditioner at your local paint store. Butcher block is composed of many pieces of wood, each with their own distinct color. Applying wood conditioner before you stain will help all the pieces of wood take on a similar tone once the stain is applied. Sand the butcher block a final time with 220-grit sandpaper. Once the conditioner has dried, go over the entire surface of the butcher block with very fine sandpaper. As before, use long strokes in the direction that the blocks are laid. Be sure to remove any splotches or discoloration caused by the conditioner. Use a clean rag to wipe off the fine dust left from sanding. If you\u2019re tired of sanding by hand, you can rent an electric sander from a local hardware store. Applying the Stain Choose a water- or oil-based wood stain in the color you prefer. Oil-based stains are longer lasting and more stain resistant. They also penetrate more deeply into the wood. Water-based stains are generally quicker to apply. Decide which you want to use, then bring home a few color swatches to determine which you prefer.
