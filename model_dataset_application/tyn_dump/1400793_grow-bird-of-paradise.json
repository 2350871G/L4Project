          "description":"Bird of paradise seeds take up to a year to germinate, and young plants may not flower for seven years. It's much easier to buy a bird of paradise plant or cutting rather than to start the plant from seed, but if you have patience it can be done. Look for bird of paradise seeds or plants in your local garden nursery. If you live in an area where the climate is conducive to growing bird of paradise outside, you may be able to find seeds and cuttings in more than one variety. If you live in a place with cold winters, where bird of paradise won't survive outside, you're more likely to find a mature bird of paradise that has already been potted as a houseplant. If you prefer to plant seeds, get fresh seeds, soak them in water for three days (changing the water daily), and plant them while they're still fresh."

The plant will die if its roots stay wet and waterlogged. If you're planting bird of paradise outdoors, till the soil in your planting bed to a depth of 12 inches (30.5 cm). Work in 4 inches (10.2 cm) of rich compost or other organic material in order to enrich the soil and promote good drainage. If you're planting bird of paradise in a pot, fill up a large clay pot (equipped with drainage holes) with rich, loamy potting soil.
