          "description":"Spray some water on your resin piece or dip it in water to get it wet before smoothing it out with the sandpaper. Sand the entire surface of the resin 2-3 times before moving on to the next step. Wet sanding your resin will give you a much smoother finish than dry sanding and will also minimize the amount of dust created by the sanding process. Wear a mask or respirator while you sand so you don\u2019t inhale any airborne particles. Be sure to use wet or wet/dry sandpaper instead of ordinary sandpaper. Wet sandpaper is specifically designed to hold up when wet, whereas ordinary sandpaper or dry-only sandpaper won\u2019t work as well when it\u2019s wet."

This will better ensure that you remove any scratches that the coarser sandpaper couldn\u2019t take care of and end up with a smooth finish. Make sure all of the surfaces and divots are sanded before moving onto the next highest grit. If you want to achieve an even smoother finish, you can also sand your resin with 2000 grit sandpaper. However, in most instances, you don\u2019t need to go this far in order to get your resin smooth enough to polish."

If you see any, go back and continue sanding your resin until they\u2019re gone. Wet the resin with water to make it easier to see any scratches you missed."
