Whether you're pureeing beef, chicken, pork or lamb, you want to choose a tender cut that won't toughen up when cooked. Often the cheapest cuts of beef are the toughest, so try choosing a cut like top sirloin. For chicken, you can buy the meat boneless or bone-in. If you buy it bone-in, you'll have to be careful to make sure no tiny bones get mixed in with the puree."
