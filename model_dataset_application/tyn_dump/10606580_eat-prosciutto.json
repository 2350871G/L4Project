You can use either form in the recipes listed here, but ultimately your personal preference will end up tasting better to you. Prosciutto Crudo: Made from a cured leg of ham. This form should be deep pink in color laced with white fat. It has a thick skin that must be removed before consumption. Prosciutto Cotto: Made from a cooked leg of ham. This form should be very light pink in color, resembling sandwich meat, and while there will be fat in the meat, it will be less noticeable than in prosciutto crudo."

Mozzarella di Bufala: A variety of mozzarella created with milk from the Italian buffalo, it enhances the butteriness of the meat and harmonizes with its sweeter flavors. Parmigiano Reggiano: A hard, salty cheese that enhances it\u2019s silky texture and adds a strong salty flavor. Pecorino Romano: Pecorino Romano pairs well with prosciutto by combatting an rounding out its silky and sweet flavor. Ricotta: Ricotta harmonizes its spreadable texture with the prosciutto\u2019s melt-in-your-mouth qualities."

You can spread goat cheese, add a slice of summer fruit, or add a light dressing of balsamic reduction to spice up the appetizer, but the combination tastes delicious with no additions as well."
