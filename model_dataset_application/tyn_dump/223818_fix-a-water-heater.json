Once the dial pops up, turn it toward the ON position to activate the burner. This will turn your water heater on so you have hot water throughout your home.Tip: If the dial doesn't pop up when you let go of it, turn off the unit for 5 minutes and try again. Adjust the water heater's temperature to 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C). Turn the large dial in the front of your thermostat so it points at 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C). The burner will activate and heat the water inside your tank. Don't turn the thermostat higher than 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C) or else the water coming out of your fixtures may scald you. Changing the Thermostat on a Gas Heater Turn off the gas and water running to your water heater. The gas hose connects to the left side of your thermostat and the valve to turn it off will be located along the gas line. Turn the lever so it's perpendicular to the gas line. Then, locate the water valve on the pipe above or next to the heater and turn the lever so it's also perpendicular to the pipe. You don't need to turn off any power while working on a gas water heater. Drain the water from your water heater. Locate the drain valve on the bottom of your water heater's tank. Screw a garden hose onto the drain valve and feed the other end into a drain in the floor or to your bathtub. Open the drain valve with a screwdriver or channel lock pliers so the water empties from your tank. The water coming out of your hose will be very hot and could cause scalding-hot burns. Unscrew the lines attached to your thermostat. There should be 3 or 4 pipes that connect to the bottom of your thermostat. Use a pair of channel lock pliers to loosen the lines from your thermostat. Lightly pull the pipes away from the thermostat so they don't deform. The hose on the left side of your thermostat controls the gas intake. The pipes and lines on the bottom of the thermostat lead to the pilot and burner inside the unit. You can remove the lines while your water heater is still draining. Use a pipe wrench to remove the old thermostat. Grip the sides of your thermostat between the jaws of a pipe wrench. Turn the wrench counterclockwise to loosen the thermostat from the tank. Keep rotating the thermostat by hand until it's free from the tank. Don't unscrew the thermostat while there's still water inside since it could spill out. Seal the threading on your new thermostat with Teflon tape. Locate the threading on the back side of the thermostat that attaches to your tank. Wrap 5-6 layers of Teflon tape around the threading to seal it. Make sure you wrap your tape in the same direction as the way it's screwed in. Replacement thermostats can be bought online or directly from the water heater manufacturer, and they usually cost around $85-$90 USD. Teflon tape may also be called thread-seal or plumber's tape. Screw the new thermostat in its place. Once the thermostat is sealed, place the threading into the hole on your tank where the old thermostat used to be. Turn the thermostat clockwise to tighten it in place. When you can't tighten it by hand anymore, use your pipe wrench to secure it in place. Make sure the thermostat is right-side up when you're finished or else the dial will be upside down. Reattach the lines and pipes to the new thermostat. Use your channel lock pliers to secure the gas hose back onto the side of your thermostat. Then match the pilot and burner lines to the ports on the bottom of your thermostat and tighten them with your pliers. You do not need to seal the connections from the lines to your thermostat. Open the valves and start your thermostat. Reopen the gas and water valves leading to your water heater so it can start filling and warming up again. Relight the pilot light and turn your thermostat to 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C) so you have hot water throughout your home.Warning: Don't turn your thermostat past 120 \u00b0F (49 \u00b0C) since it will cause scalding hot water to come out of your fixtures. Fixing a Leaky Pressure-Relief Valve Turn off the water supply to your water heater. Locate the water supply pipe above or next to your water heater. Turn the lever on the valve so it's perpendicular to the pipes. This prevents any more water from entering the tank while you're working on it. Drain 10 US gal (38 L) from your water heater. Attach a garden hose the drain valve on the bottom of your water heater's tank. Place the other end of the hose next to bath or floor drain. Open the valve with a screwdriver or pair of pliers and let it drain for about 15-30 minutes. Once about 10 US gal (38 L) are drained from the tank, close the drain valve and disconnect the hose. Many water heaters have a drain in the floor next to them. Detach the run-off pipe from the pressure-relief valve. The pressure-relief valve is located on top of your unit in the center. The valve should be attached to a pipe that leads down the side of your tank. Use a pair of channel lock pliers where the pipe connects to the valve. Rotate it counterclockwise to loosen it from the valve and remove it. Set the run-off pipe aside since you'll need to attach it to the new valve. Use channel lock pliers to unscrew the pressure-relief valve. Grip the base of the pressure-relief valve between the jaws of your channel lock pliers. Rotate the valve counterclockwise to loosen it, and then spin the valve by hand. Pull the valve out from the tank to remove it. The valve may release steam as you unscrew it. Keep your head away from the valve and wear work gloves while handling it. Seal the threads on a new pressure-relief valve with Teflon tape. Sealing the valve helps prevent any unwanted leaks through the threading. Wrap 5-6 layers of Teflon tape around the threading on your new valve in the same direction that it screws in. When you're finished wrapping it, cut the piece of tape. Pressure-relief valves can be purchased online or directly from the water heater's manufacturer for about $20 USD. Teflon tape may be called thread-seal or plumber's tape. Any of these will work for sealing your valve. Screw the new valve into your water heater. Place the threading of the valve in the hole where the old one used to be. Screw the valve in by hand as far as you can. Then, use your channel lock pliers to tighten the valve until you can't rotate it anymore. Keep the lever on top of your valve is horizontal when it's installed.Tip: Make sure the valve points in a direction where you can easily attach your run-off pipe. Reattach the run-off pipe to the valve. Fit the threading of the run-off pipe into the side of the valve so the pipe hangs over the edge of the water heater's tank. Turn the pipe clockwise to tighten it onto your valve. Use your channel lock pliers when you can't tighten the piper by hand any further. You may need to seal the run-off pipe with Teflon tape as well if it hasn't already been sealed. Turn on your water heater's water supply. Turn the lever on your water supply so that it's pointing the same direction as your pipe. The water supply will start to fill your tank so you can use hot water in your home again. Open a hot water faucet somewhere in your home. Pick any sink or fixture in your home and set it so the hot water is running. Nothing will come out of the faucet yet, but it will relive the pressure inside your tank so the valve is installed properly. Pull the lever open on the valve. After a faucet's been opened, pull the lever on top of your valve up to alleviate more pressure from inside the tank. Once the lever is open, you may notice some water going down the run-off pipe. Close the lever once a steady stream of water flows through the run-off pipe. As your water heats up, the pressure inside the tank will increase and water will be forced out of the pressure-relief valve. When you notice the stream coming out from your run-off pipe, close the valve so the lever is horizontal again. You can also turn off your water faucet once the stream is steady.",
