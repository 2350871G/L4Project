You may need to drill holes in the wood to hang it from the hangers. Generally, you'll want to attach your piece of wood close to the top of the door, within a foot (30.5 cm) from the door frame. Alternatively, you can place the alarm flat on a desk, nightstand, or bookshelf positioned close to the door so you don't have to hang it.

Use removable wall hangers or tape to attach the wood on the wall. This will be the base of your door alarm. You may need to drill holes in the wood to hang it from the hangers.

An alarm that's high up will be harder to reach and deactivate. Doing this, however, might require more string. Cut three strands of insulated wire.

If the insulation doesn't come free easily, use a pair of pliers to grip the insulation firmly and pull it off. Building the Alarm Tape the battery and buzzer onto your wooden board. Use electrical tape to attach these to the wood. The tape should not interfere with or cover any of the connections for the electrical circuit for the buzzer, nor should it cover the positive (+) or negative (-) ends of the battery. Your buzzer may come with screw holes. For a sturdier alarm, you can screw your buzzer into the wood. Be careful to use short nails so these don't protrude through the board. Wrap the stripped wire around the ends of the clothespin. Wrap one stripped end of two pieces of wire around frontmost divot of the top of the clip-end of the clothespin. Do the same to the bottom of the clip-end of the pin with a separate wire. Twist the stripped wires around the pin until they are tight. When the pin closes, the wires should touch. This will complete the circuit that sets off your alarm. Connect the bottom-pin wire to the battery. Position the wire so it is directly touching the positive (+) end of the battery. Use a piece of electrical tape to fasten the wire in place. If your battery is in a dock or cradle, attach the wire to the positive connector or wire for the cradle and tape it in place. Connect one non-battery wire to the buzzer. There should be a small opening in the buzzer where you can insert your wire. There should be two connectors, positive and negative. Touch one of your top clothespin wires directly to the positive input for the buzzer. Alternatively, your buzzer may have wire leads coming off of it. Strip these, if necessary, and twist your non-battery wire to the positive buzzer wire. Break the circuit with a piece of cardboard. Cut a medium sized piece of cardboard to insert between the wires wrapped around the clothespin. Insert the cardboard so that the wires on the clothespin do not touch when it is closed. This will stop the buzzer from going off. Any non-conductive material will work to break your circuit. Try small pieces of paper, wood, or rubber. You may need to fold thin cardboard so there is more distance between wires. Very thin cardboard may not reliably keep the circuit broken. Connect the remaining wires. Attach the stripped end of one of your remaining free clothespin wires to the negative (-) end of the battery. Fasten it with electrical tape.

Be careful not to knock out the circuit breaker between the wires of your clothespin. Doing so will complete the circuit, and likely cause a small shock when you try to attach the wire to the buzzer. Test the switch by completing the circuit. Lay your alarm on a flat surface. Open the clothespin and remove the circuit breaker (piece of cardboard). When the clothespin closes, the circuit should complete and the buzzer turn on. The ends of stripped wire on the clothespin should be in good contact. If they aren't or are just barely touching, wrap more wire around the clothespin. When adjusting the clothespin wires, disengage your battery from the circuit to prevent getting shocked. Check connections and the battery if the buzzer doesn't activate. If the buzzer doesn't activate, one of the connections is likely loose.

Glue the clothespin so it is positioned somewhat close to the battery and buzzer. Follow the glue directions and allow the glue to dry completely before moving on. A clothespin is small enough that general purpose glue or hot glue should work to fasten it. For best results, you may want to use a sturdy glue or a wood glue. Manage excess wires with tape and hang the board. Wires sticking out in all directions can be a hazard. They can snag on objects or be easily pulled out. Damaged wires will deactivate your alarm. Tape your wires to the board to prevent them from snagging or being pulled out. Then re-hang the board on the wall. Attach the string to the piece of cardboard in the clothespin.
