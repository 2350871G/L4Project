Start with a rectangular piece of colored paper and fold it in half along the width. Unfold it so that there\u2019s one line down the middle, creating 2 identical squares on the paper. Fold up from the bottom and do a few accordion folds. Take the bottom edge of the paper and fold it up to meet the central line. Then, fold the edge back down to meet the crease you just created. Flip the paper over and bend the bottom edge back up to meet the central crease, creating an accordion-like fold. At the end of this step, this bottom square should be folded up into a small rectangle just under the central crease. Repeat on the other half of the paper. Fold the small slip of paper in half width-wise. You should now have a small, thin rectangle of folded paper. Unfold it slightly to verify that it has even, accordion folds. Then, crease it again and flip it so that the folded part is facing up. Fold it in half lengthwise to create a line right down the middle. Staple on top of the crease to hold it together.

Press the paper together, repeat the same gluing shape on the paper on top, then spread out the petals until the two sides touch. Press them together to cement the glue in place.

Spread a bit of glue into the crease of one of the petals and press it together. Move to the left 2 petals and repeat. Then, turn the flower over and snip off these these two extra petals, using a diagonal cut close to the center of the flower. Adjust and spread out the rest of the petals to finish your flower! Finished!  Making Crepe Paper Flowers Cut a strip of crepe paper and make accordion folds. Take out a stack of crepe paper, or tissue paper, and cut it to about 5 inches (13 cm) long. Unwrap it and make 5 accordion folds of about 6 inches (15 cm) each. Cut off any extra paper and discard it, or save it for another project. Cut at the folds, then stack the paper and make smaller accordion folds. Hold the crepe paper up and carefully cut through the folded edges on either side to make a stack of loose paper. Starting at the bottom of the stack, fold it in an accordion shape, making each fold about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) wide. Fold all the way to the top edge. When you\u2019re done, you should have a thick stack of skinny, rectangular folds. Fold the stack in half and bend a pipe cleaner around the center. Find the halfway of your stack by folding it in half width-wise. Place a pipe cleaner across this central fold. Then, bend it around the center, crossing under the stack to the other side. Twist it around the remaining pipe cleaner to hold it in place. Spread open the folded paper and ruffle it into a flower shape. Open up the folded paper on either side of the pipe cleaner center to make a bow shape. Gently peel the layers of paper away from each other, adjusting and crimping them slightly to create full, dimensional petals. You can enjoy your crepe paper flower as is, or make 1-2 more, using different colors. Wind their stems together for a big, bright bouquet. Finished! ",
