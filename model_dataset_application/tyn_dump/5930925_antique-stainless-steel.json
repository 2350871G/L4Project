Also note that you will need to handle the stainless steel object with another device, like tongs or a vice.

If you've recently made a pot of coffee, you can use the spent grounds from that. Otherwise, pour enough warm to hot water over a fresh batch of grounds and give the grounds a few minutes to absorb the moisture\nFor small, narrow objects like screws, you can fill a small cup with your prepared grounds. For larger objects, coat the bottom of a shallow tray with the grounds, instead."

          "description":"Hold the metal object with tongs or a vice, then pass the flame of a lighter over the entire length of the object, heating it thoroughly. Continue rotating and passing the flame over the stainless steel object until the metal begins to darken in color. For larger objects or a more controlled flame, consider using a propane tank with a lighter attachment instead of a handheld lighter. The stainless steel will reach temperatures just beneath 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius), so you need to work very carefully to prevent accidental burns."

          "description":"As soon as the steel object darkens, quickly dip the heated portion into the prepared coffee grounds. Hold it in the grounds for 15 to 30 seconds. The water in the coffee grounds should quickly cool off the metal. Theoretically, the steel should be safe to touch once you remove it from the grounds, but you should still proceed with caution. In addition to cooling off the metal, the coffee should dye the stainless steel, giving it the appearance of antiqued metal."

You should be able repeat the process several times without damaging the metal. If you only want to dye one side or area darker, focus the heat on that area and only apply the coffee grounds to that spot."

Wait until the object is cool enough to touch before polishing it. Polishing the piece should buff away coffee granules and some of the dark dye. It should also make the steel a little shinier. After you dye and polish the piece to your liking, the project is complete. The results should last indefinitely."

It also removes some of the protective coating, allowing more of the vinegar to penetrate and work its way through the metal. Steel wool pads will usually create deeper scratches, so if you want to create more subtle wear, use sandpaper instead. Choose a medium to heavy grit sandpaper for best results."

          "headline":"Cover with vinegar.",
          "description":"Pour vinegar into the container, covering all sides of the stainless steel piece. You may want to wear safety goggles and safety gloves when handling vinegar. Even though vinegar is a mild acid, it could sting if it splashes into your eyes. Vinegar can also be a mild irritant if you have sensitive skin or if your skin is submerged for prolonged periods. Every side touching the vinegar will be affected. Any type of vinegar should work for this project, but white distilled vinegar is recommended since it is fairly cheap and easy to come by. If the steel piece starts to float, hold it down by placing stones or dry beans on top of it. Make sure that the vinegar still has access to the piece, however."

If the vinegar doesn't produce results, you could try using a more corrosive chemical. Toilet bowl cleaner generally works well. Bleach, denture cleaner, and silver dip may also yield results.

Method Three: Acrylic Painting Prepare your supplies. You'll need metallic acrylic craft paint, an art paintbrush, and a wet sponge. Look for a deep gray metallic paint.

You may also want to wear an artist's smock or apron to protect your clothes. Brush on the first coat.

Set the stainless steel piece aside and allow it to dry completely before handling it further. Examine the dry piece. Most of the natural metal should show through beneath the coat of paint. Determine whether or not you are satisfied with these results. Carefully consider additional coats of paint.
