A quick way to dry it is pouring the salad into a spinner and whipping it dry. If you don\u2019t have a spinner, then pour the salad onto paper towels and pat it dry. Do this even if you haven\u2019t washed the salad. The plastic bags the salad comes in trap moisture inside, so the vegetables will always be a little wet."

You can also use a sealable plastic bag instead of a container. Line the bag with paper towels and pour the salad in. Remember that the bag won\u2019t protect the salad from bruising, so it may not last as long as it will in a container."

Continue monitoring the salad for browning spots or wilting, indicating that it\u2019s starting to go bad. When most of the leaves are wilting and discolored, then get rid of the salad. The exact storage time depends on if the leaves had any bruising before you stored them. Damaged leaves will decay faster. Shredded lettuce may not last as long as whole leaves because it\u2019s been damaged during the cutting process. Salad mixes with shredded lettuce may only last about 5 days. This assumes the salad is plain and dry. Salad with dressing or bagged coleslaw won\u2019t last longer than 3-5 days, even with proper storage."
