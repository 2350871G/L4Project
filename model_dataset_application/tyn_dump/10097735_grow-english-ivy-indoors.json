Choose a container that has holes in the bottom for water drainage. If the plant becomes too big for its container, you can cut it back and start new plants. Consider using plastic or clay pots, but keep in mind that clay pots won't hold the moisture in the soil for as long."

Avoid putting the plant near a window where it will get direct light because this can make the leaves burn and wilt. To give the plant enough light in the winter, you can move it to a space where it gets more direct light or set up artificial lights."

If your plant isn't putting on new growth or the leaves begin to wilt, change its location to see if it improves. If your plant's leaves begin to wilt, it may be getting too much direct sunlight, so move it to a shadier spot in your house. For example, check the temperature in your house and move the English Ivy plant if the temperature drops into the 50s (F) or 10s (C). Position your plant away from cool drafts, such as an air conditioner vent."
