Wait until next spring to prune. If the rosebush blooms come straight from the old canes, rather than from new growth, the bush should be pruned after it flowers instead. Hybrid tea roses should ideally be pruned in the early spring, after the threat of the coldest days is over and before the buds starts to swell.

Using the Right Pruning Technique Use a good pair of pruning shears and long-handled loppers. The shears are for smaller branches, and the loppers are for thick canes. Make sure your tools are sharp so they will make clean cuts rather than causing tears and rips in the stems. Rinse shears in alcohol before pruning. Rinse them again before moving on to another bush. This step disinfects your shears and prevents the transfer of diseases, such as black spot, between the plants. Cut at a 45 degree angle. This way water will run off of the \"wound\" instead of collecting there. It helps prevent disease and mold from growing on the rose bush.

This isn't absolutely necessary, but it's a good idea if you have pest problems in your area. It prevents rose boring insects from invading, and helps prevent stem diseases. Pruning to Maximize the Health of Your Roses Remove the dead canes. These are the black, shriveled stalks that will no longer produce new growth. The healthy canes are green or brown and firm. Use your pruning shears to cut them as close to the base as possible. If you find a cane that looks like it's still partially alive, make a cut 1/4 ich above one of the bud eyes. Prune the suckers.
