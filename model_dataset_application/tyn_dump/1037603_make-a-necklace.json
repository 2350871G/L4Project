Thread, such as nylon fishing line, stretchy thread, or a durable polyester or cotton thread in the color of your choice. This is the best option for beaded necklaces. Wire made from copper, aluminum, or stainless steel is also a good base for stringing beads. Some types of wire are also color-coated, so you can get them in the color of your choice."

Otherwise, it may be hard to secure the ends. Some common necklace lengths include:\n16.5 in (42 cm) (also known as choker length)\n18 in (46 cm) (hits right on the collarbone)\n20 in (51 cm) (falls just below the collarbone)\n24 in (61 cm) (rests in the center of the chest)\n28\u201329.5 in (71\u201375 cm) (falls between the breasts)\n31.5 in (80 cm) (hits right at the top of the abdomen)\n35 in (89 cm) (sits just above the belly button)\n40 in (100 cm) (rests right at the belly button or just below it)"

          "description":"You can use any type of beads you want to create your necklace. Purchase beads in the jewelry supply section of a craft supply store or online. Make sure that you can fit the necklace base material through the openings on your beads. Use seed beads as filler or for a delicate beaded necklace. Seed beads are small beads that will fill out the wire or thread. These are great for creating a delicate necklace or for filling the spaces in between your larger beads. Choose chunky beads for a statement necklace. Chunky beads work well as a complement to smaller beads, or as the main element in a chunky statement necklace. Wire or fishing line works best as a base for chunky beads since they are heavier than normal beads."

          "headline":"Tie the end of your necklace base around 1 end of a clasp, if desired.",
          "description":"A clasp is optional for a beaded necklace. If the necklace is large enough, then you can simply tie the ends together when you are finished. Or, use a lobster clasp in the color and size of your choice. Insert the end of the wire or thread through the end of the clasp and tie it in a knot. This will prevent the beads from slipping off as you string them and then you will also have the first half of the clasp in place. If desired, you may also place a crimp bead onto the wire or thread just behind the clasp. This will help to secure it. Wrap the crimp bead around the wire or thread and press it closed with your fingers or a pair of pliers."

Once you have decided how you are going to embellish your necklace base, begin adding the beads to the base in the order you want. Keep adding beads until the necklace base is full or you are finished adding to it. For example, if you are making a beaded necklace, then add your beads until the necklace base has the number of beads on it that you want it to! This may mean filling the strand with beads or just adding a few beads to the strand. Create a pattern with your beads. For example, you can alternate red and black beads, or use a combination of red, yellow, green, and blue in a specific sequence."

Do this the same way you did for the first part of the clasp. You may also add a crimp bead behind the clasp for extra security if desired."

You may want to tie a double or even triple knot to be sure that the necklace is secured. Then, cut the excess thread or cord 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the knot. If you have opted for stretchy thread as a base for a beaded necklace, then this is a great option. You can also do this if you have made the necklace large enough to easily fit over your head. Typically necklaces that are 24 in (61 cm) or larger will fit over your head easily."
