          "description":"While you can plant hardwood cuttings in the early-spring, most gardeners choose to take hardwood cuttings in the fall when there isn\u2019t much gardening work to do. Wait until all of the leaves fall off of your plant before you take your cuttings to ensure that you are only cutting dormant plants. This entire process can be completed in 20-30 minutes.Variation: If you want to take your cuttings in the late summer or early fall, wait for the stems of a young plant to partially mature. Take your clippings when the wood is hard, but easily bendable. This is known as semi-hardwood cutting, but the process is generally the same. The main difference is that semi-hardwood cuts tend to do best when planted in a pot. Alternatively, you can take your hardwood cuttings right before the plant buds in spring, but it may take an additional year for these plants to grow. You can take hardwood cuttings in the middle of winter if you\u2019d like, but if the ground has frozen, it may prevent the cuttings from developing roots. While there is no exhaustive list of hardwood cuttings, popular choices include hydrangea, juniper, tea olive, boxwood, and honey locust."

Any section that is hard and even in color should work just fine. This is a pretty low-risk process. If you can\u2019t tell if a branch grew well last season, give it the benefit of the doubt.

It doesn\u2019t matter where you clip the branch so long as there\u2019s a bud directly above the base and the length of your cutting ends up with at least 2 buds on it. So long as you leave a few healthy branches on the original plant, you can trim as many branches as you like. You can take anywhere from 2-50 cuttings.

    "The end of each cutting that was closest to the soil is going to be your base, so orient all of your cuttings in the same direction as you collect them.",
    "Strip the tip of each length at a 45-degree angle above the bud.",
    "On each individual branch, clip the tip of the cutting at the top with your garden shears.",
    "Make an angular cut 0.75\u20131.5 in (1.9\u20133.8 cm) directly above a bud.",
    "This step is entirely optional if your shrub has historically had an easy time growing in your garden.",
    "After you plant the cutting, this angular cut will harden and protect the top of the branch.",
    "Make sure that each branch is still 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm) in length after you\u2019ve cut both ends.",
    "Cut notches near the base of any hard-to-grow cuttings.",
    "If you have a shrub that is particularly difficult to grow, use the blade of a utility knife to strip a little bit of bark off.",
    "Cut a 0.25\u20131 in (0.64\u20132.54 cm) notch anywhere near the bottom bud on each length.",
    "This will help protect the base of the plant since the cut will harden after it heals.",
    "This is referred to as \u201cwounding\u201d a plant.",
    "Trees tend to be the most difficult species to grow from hardwood cuttings.",
    "Many gardeners skip this step on deciduous species since they believe it doesn\u2019t have a large impact on the growth of the plant.",
    "Planting Your Cuttings Soak the bottom 3\u20135 inches (7.6\u201312.7 cm) of each cutting in a rooting powder.",
    "Fill a small bowl or cup with a hormone rooting powder or planting compound.",
    "Group your cuttings together so that the bases are bundled at the same height.",
    "Dip the bottom 3\u20135 inches (7.6\u201312.7 cm) of the cuttings into your powder or compound.",
    "Let them soak for 6 seconds before lifting them out.",
    "Do this right before you plant the cuttings.",
    "It does not matter what brand of hormone rooting powder or compound that you use.",
    "This step is not mandatory if your shrub tends to grow just fine on its own.",
    "Many gardeners don\u2019t bother with this step if they\u2019re planting a deciduous plant since they\u2019re already quite resilient when it comes to growing roots.",
    "Pour a \u20442\u20132 in (1.3\u20135.1 cm) layer of sand over your planting location.",
    "If you can, plant your cuttings in the same type soil or medium where the dormant plant is rooted.",
    "Usually, it\u2019s best to plant your cuttings 6\u201310 feet (1.8\u20133.0 m) away from the parent plants.",
    "Pour a thin, \u20442\u20132 in (1.3\u20135.1 cm) layer of sand over the soil.",
    "Spread it out by hand or use the blade of a trowel to even the sand out.Variation: Alternatively, you can plant your cuttings in a pot to grow them in a temperature-controlled environment.",
    "Use a mixture of 1-part sand and 1-part compost.",
    "Transfer the roots outdoors once your cuttings begin to bud.",
    "This is generally an unpopular way to grow hardwood cuttings, but it\u2019s the best way to encourage semi-hardwood roots to take hold.",
    "This is especially important if you\u2019re planting your cuttings when it is cold out.",
    "The sand will protect the soil near the base of the plant and help the roots maintain moisture.",
    "You can use a mixture of 1-part peat and 1-part perlite if you prefer.",
    "Dig a trench that is \u20444\u2013\u20442 inch (0.64\u20131.27 cm) wide in the soil.",
    "To carve out a trench for your cuttings, get a hard putty knife, blade, or flat shovel.",
    "Dig a thin trench into the soil by digging the flat edge of your tool up and down in a straight line.",
    "Make your trench 4\u20138 in (10\u201320 cm) deep to give the cuttings a stable space to grow.",
    "Cuttings are traditionally planted in rows of trenches, but you can choose to simply push them into the soil if the ground is soft.",
    "If you\u2019re planting multiple rows of cuttings, leave at least 16 inches (41 cm) between each trench.",
    "If you\u2019re planting your cuttings in a pot, you can skip this step entirely.",
    "The potting soil won\u2019t be as hard as the ground outside and you can simply press these cuttings into the soil.",
    "Insert each cutting 2/3 of the way into the trench.",
    "For each individual branch, gently slide the base of the cutting into the trench.",
    "Insert the cutting into the trench so that at least half of the branch is embedded underground.",
    "Keep your cutting as vertical as possible.",
    "If you plant your cuttings at an angle, the roots are going to grow unevenly and your plant will be more likely to die.",
    "If you\u2019re planting your cuttings in a pot, place your cuttings in the center of the container.",
    "You can place 1-10 cuttings in your pot based on its size.",
    "Leave at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) between each cutting.",
    "Leave 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) between each individual cutting.",
    "To give each cutting enough space to grow roots, leave a little space in between each branch.",
    "At a minimum, leave 4 inches (10 cm) between each cutting.",
    "If the cuttings are too close to one another, the roots will fight for resources.",
    "If the cuttings are too far apart, the root systems may not link up and your shrubs may take a long time to grow.",
    "Some of your cuttings may not grow.",
    "The hope is that enough of the cuttings will develop healthy roots that smaller plants will grow together into larger shrubs over time.",
    "Water new cuttings immediately to encourage growth.",
    "Once your cuttings are planted, fill a watering can with water.",
    "Pour water directly over your cuttings until they\u2019re thoroughly wet.",
    "Add some water to the sand to soak the 12\u201318 inches (30\u201346 cm) surrounding each cutting.",
    "This will provide your soil with enough nutrients to encourage your roots to take hold.",
    "Do not add so much water that it starts to pool on top of your sand.",
    "If you\u2019re propagating semi-hardwood cuttings, wrap each plant in plastic to create a miniature greenhouse after you water them.",
    "Alternatively, you can use horticultural fleece to keep the plant covered if you\u2019re planting semi-hardwood cuttings outdoors.",
    "You do not need to cover hardwood cuttings, but you can if you\u2019re worried about predators.",
    "Watering and Encouraging Growth Spritz your cuttings with water in dry weather keep them moist.",
    "Once you\u2019ve watered your cuttings once, you can generally leave them alone for the rest of the winter.",
    "During particularly dry spells, check the sand around your cuttings.",
    "If the sand is completely dry, mist your cuttings with a spray bottle or pour a small amount of water over the sand to keep the cuttings healthy.Tip: The water requirements tend to differ dramatically between species of plants.",
    "Flowering shrubs will generally require more water than other varieties.",
    "In general though, you shouldn\u2019t need to water your cuttings more than once a week.",
    "Do this through the spring and summer as well.",
    "Firm back the soil after freezes and harsh weather, if needed.",
    "The soil in your garden may be broken up after periods of extreme cold or bad weather.",
    "After every storm or harsh freeze, go out to your cuttings and inspect the soil in and around your trench.",
    "If it has separated and softened up, use your hands or the flat side of a trowel to press the dirt down and compact it.",
    "This will keep your cuttings from slipping out of the trench where you planted them.",
    "You can install horticultural fleece over the cuttings if you find the soil softening up regularly, but most cuttings do just fine without a cover.",
    "You do not need to worry about this is you\u2019re storing a potted cutting indoors.",
    "Wait 6-18 months for your cuttings to grow strong roots.",
    "Growing hardwood cuttings can take quite a bit of patience.",
    "Depending on the species of your plant, it can take anywhere from 3-6 months for hardwood cuttings to take root and even longer for noticeable growth to occur.",
    "Continue to monitor the moisture of your plants and water as needed until your shrubs or trees grow.",
    "Do not transfer your plants to pots or other parts of your garden until they\u2019ve grown to be at least three times the size of your original cuttings.",
    "Transfer your plants to another part of your garden, if desired.",
    "Wait for the shrub or tree to develop leaves before moving it.",
    "At least 6-12 months before you move it, cut the roots of the plant by digging directly into the ground around the plant in a 1\u20134 ft (0.30\u20131.22 m) circle.",
    "Then, use a shovel to dig 2\u20133 feet (0.61\u20130.91 m) under the plant.",
    "Put the shrub or tree in a wheelbarrow if necessary and transfer it to its new location before adding your top soil or fertilizer.",
    "Ideally, transfer your plant in the late-spring or early summer when it is actively growing.",
    "You do not have to move your plants if you\u2019re happy with the location where you grew them.",
    "If you\u2019re transferring a juvenile plant out of a pot, transfer the entire contents of the pot to your hole.",
    "Leaving the roots and soil alone will give your plant the best chance at growing."
