    "Once you protect the drain with the tape, you can start applying mortar for your shower pan.",
    "If you don\u2019t have any duct tape, you can also shove a cloth into the drain pipe to prevent mortar from getting inside.",
    "Applying a Mortar Base Mix mortar inside of a mixing tray with a hoe.",
    "Pour a bag of quick-set mortar into a large mixing tray and spread it out evenly.",
    "Pour in a small amount of water at a time and mix the mortar together with a garden hoe.",
    "Aim to use 1 part water for every 4 parts of mortar mix to get the right consistency.",
    "As you mix the mortar, form it into a ball and squeeze it with your hands.",
    "If water comes out, then use more of the mortar mix until the ball holds its shape.",
    "If your mortar is too runny, it will be difficult to apply since it won\u2019t hold its shape as well.",
    "The amount of mortar you need depends on the size of your shower pan.",
    "For a 4 ft \u00d7 4 ft (1.2 m \u00d7 1.2 m) shower pan, you need approximately 2 bags that are each 30 pounds (14 kg) of mortar.",
    "Create a 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) thick border around the frame of the shower.",
    "Dump the mortar onto the tar paper so you can easily spread it around.",
    "Use a flat trowel to push and shape the mortar into a border around the shower that\u2019s 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) thick and extends out 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) from the frame.",
    "Press down on the mortar with the trowel to compact it so there aren\u2019t any air pockets.",
    "Shaping the border first isn\u2019t necessary, but it makes it easier to slope later on.",
    "Spread and smooth out the mortar so it slopes toward the drain flange.",
    "Once you have a border around the edge of your shower, start smoothing out the mortar toward the bottom flange of your drain.",
    "Start from the corner furthest away from the curb and work backward so you don\u2019t disturb any of the mortar you\u2019ve already worked on.",
    "Slope the mortar so it drops \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) per 1 foot (30 cm) between the wall and the drain.",
    "The first layer of mortar doesn\u2019t have to be perfectly smooth, but it needs to have the correct slope in order to move on.",
    "Make sure you apply the entire layer of mortar in 1 day, or else it could dry unevenly.Tip: Check the slope of your mortar with a level frequently to ensure that the floor doesn\u2019t have any humps or valleys.",
    "Let the mortar dry for at least 24 hours before removing the tape.",
    "Once you have the mortar smoothed out as much as you can, leave it alone overnight so it can set.",
    "The mortar takes about 24 hours to set before you can start working on it again.",
    "When the mortar is dry, peel off or cut through the tape that\u2019s covering the drain to remove it.",
    "Waterproofing the Shower Cut shower liner so it\u2019s 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) taller than the framing.",
    "Shower liner is a waterproof barrier that serves as another layer of protection for your subfloor.",
    "Measure the size of your shower pan and add 8 inches (20 cm) to each side to account for the framing on the side.",
    "Cut the liner using a utility knife so it fits inside your shower pan.",
    "You can buy shower liner from a local home improvement or hardware store.",
    "Apply a bead of silicone around the bottom drain flange to prevent leaks.",
    "Put your silicone sealant in a silicone gun so you can easily apply it to the shower pan.",
    "Follow along the outer rim of the drain\u2019s bottom flange and squeeze the trigger to apply a thin bead of silicone.",
    "The silicone helps hold the liner in place and prevents water from getting underneath it.",
    "You can buy silicone sealant from your local hardware store.",
    "Place the liner inside your shower pan so it\u2019s smooth.",
    "Slowly lay the liner down on the mortar and smooth it out as much as you can.",
    "Align the shower liner so the edges extend 2 inches (5.1 cm) up past the tops of the 2 in \u00d7 6 in (5.1 cm \u00d7 15.2 cm) frame.",
    "Push the liner tightly around the edge of the mortar so it stays as smooth as possible.",
    "Press the liner down onto the silicone bead you applied so it sticks in place.Tip: If the liner is bunched up in the corners, you can either overlap the liner on top of itself or you can tuck it between wall studs.",
    "Do not cut the liner in the corners or else it will not have a tight seal.",
    "Secure the liner to the wall studs with nails or staples.",
    "Only nail the very top edge of the liner to the wall studs so there\u2019s less risk of it leaking.",
    "Use roofing nails or woodworking staples on every wall stud to secure the liner in place.",
    "Work your way around the liner, ensuring that it stays smooth on the floor.",
    "Cut holes in the liner for the drain.",
    "Feel through the liner to find the drain hole and the bolts sticking up from the flange.",
    "Use your utility knife to cut X-shapes into the liner over the hole and bolts so you can access them.",
    "Fold the flaps of the liner down into the drain hole so any water and moisture flows into the pipes.",
    "You can also cut the hole out entirely, but it may cause some water to leak between the drain and the liner.",
    "Screw the top part of the drain onto the bottom flange.",
    "The second part of your drain has an upper flange that attaches to the bottom using the bolts.",
    "Screw the top flange clockwise into the drain hole so it\u2019s about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) above the bottom flange.",
    "Then tighten the bolts on the bottom flange to secure it.",
    "Don\u2019t screw the top flange into the drain until it\u2019s flush since you need to add another layer of mortar.",
    "Apply another layer of mortar on top of the shower liner and let it dry.",
    "Mix more mortar and follow the same process as before.",
    "Start by applying a 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) thick border around the edges and slope the mortar toward the drain.",
    "Get the mortar as smooth as possible so it doesn\u2019t have any humps or valleys, or else water won\u2019t drain easily.",
    "Check the mortar\u2019s slope with a level frequently and smooth out any rough areas.",
    "Leave the mortar to dry for 24 hours to finish your shower pan.",
    "If you\u2019re putting tile in your shower pan, be sure to leave enough space between the mortar and the top of the drain so the tile is flush with the drain.",
    "Tiling the Shower Dry-fit the tiles in the shower pan so you know how they fit.",
    "Take one of the tiles that you want to use for your shower pan and place it next to the drain.",
    "Trace around the tile with a pencil to mark how it fits on the shower pan.",
    "Keep placing the tile down and tracing it to see how many tiles you\u2019ll need to use and what size you need to cut them if you need to.",
    "Choose tiles that match other fixtures in your bathroom so it looks like a cohesive space.",
    "The number of tiles you need depends on the size of your shower pan and the style that you\u2019re using.",
    "Wipe the mortar with a wet cloth to clean up any dust.",
    "The dust on your mortar can prevent the tiles from adhering to the shower pan.",
    "Wet a cleaning cloth with water and wipe the entire surface clean.",
    "Once the shower pan is clean, dry it off with a lint-free rag so the surface isn\u2019t wet anymore.",
    "Don\u2019t put tiles on your mortar while it\u2019s wet or they may not adhere as well.",
    "Apply an \u20448 in (0.32 cm) layer of thinset on the shower pan.",
    "Only use enough thinset for 1-2 tiles at a time so it doesn\u2019t set while you\u2019re working.",
    "Use a flat trowel to scoop and spread out the thinset.",
    "Smooth the thinset with the trowel so there\u2019s an \u20448 in (0.32 cm) layer on the mortar.",
    "You can buy tile thinset from your local hardware store.",
    "Press your tiles into the thinset to secure them.",
    "Set the tiles carefully on thinset so it lines up with the marks you drew earlier.",
    "Firmly push down on the tile so the bottom fully contacts the adhesive, or else your tiles may easily lift up.",
    "Wait 1-2 minutes before wiping any thinset off that came up between the tile joints.",
    "If you want all your tiles to be the same distance apart, then use tile spacers so the shower pan looks uniform.",
    "Grout the tiles so they\u2019re flush with the drain.",
    "Mix the grout in the container it came in or a large bucket.",
    "Pour some of the grout onto the tiles and spread it over your tiles with a flat trowel or rubber squeegee.",
    "Work the grout into the spaces between your tiles so water doesn\u2019t get through and so the surface is flat.",
    "Once you apply the grout, let it dry for at least 1 hour.",
    "You can buy tile grout from your local home improvement or hardware store."
