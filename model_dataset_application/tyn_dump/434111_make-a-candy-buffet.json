Fill the middle zone containers with scoop-able candy, such as gumballs, gummy worms, candy canes, and chocolate-covered raisins. Be sure to include tongs or scoops with these.

Another option would be to include some bulky items on your candy buffet table, such as large lollipops, cookies, or cupcakes; these items will fill up those large boxes/bags. Choose paper, organza, or cellophane bags in colors that match your party's theme. Choose mini take-out boxes, gift boxes, or favor tins in colors that match your party's theme."

You can also write the labels on mini chalkboards, mini wooden pick signs, clothespins, etc. Choose something that works with your decor. Don't be afraid to get creative with your labels either; you can match them to the theme of your party. For example:\nIf your party's theme is Harry Potter, you can label red licorice as \"Licorice Wands.\" Gold-foil Lindor chocolates could easily become \"Golden Snitches.\" If your party's theme is pirates, you could call chocolate coins \"Pirate's Booty\" or \"Pirate's Treasure.\" Seashell-shaped chocolates could be called \"Mermaid's Favor.\" If you are having a Halloween party, you could call chocolate raisins \"Beetle Eyes\" or \"Troll Boogers,\" and haystack cookies \"Witch Hair.\""

If you want to draw the focus to your candy buffet, consider hanging a garland or banner on the wall behind the table. You could also hang up pictures or paper cut-outs instead. Whichever you choose, make sure that the colors and themes match the theme of your party. A great example of a matching banner would be a poster that says \"Honeydukes\" for a Harry Potter themed party. Honeydukes was the name of a popular candy shop in the books. A great example of matching cut-outs would be paper snowflakes for a winter wonderland themed party. You would also hang long tinsel around the edge of the table to mimic icicles!"

You can also use small items, such as flower petals, rhinestones, strands of curled ribbon, or sequins. Whatever you end up using, make sure that it matches the theme of your party. For example, flower petals would work great for a wedding, while rhinestones would work well for a pirate themed party (to resemble treasure). Confetti comes in many different shapes and colors.
