Some types of melt-and-pour soap bases have cutting guidelines, which you can use. Make sure that you are using the melt-and-pour type of soap base, as regular bars of soap from the store won't melt. You can find melt-and-pour soap bases in the craft store and online. You can also use 12 ounces (340.2 grams) of white glycerin melt-and-pour soap base instead. Melt-and-pour soap is a great way to get started in soap making because you won't be working with lye, which can be dangerous."
