How far down the spray bottle you cut is up to you; it needs to be far enough down so that it is comfortable to hold. About 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) below the cap would be ideal. Discard the bottom part of the spray bottle. If your spray bottle has a molded handle, cut just below the molded handle. If you can't find a spray bottle, use a small air pump instead, like the kind used to fill basketballs. Be sure to take the unscrew the top nozzle. Wrap some colored tape around the bottom, cut edge of the spray bottle. This will add a little design, and hide any jagged edges."

You need to be able to push and pull the cap close/open. If you want something sturdier, you can use a short plastic or metal tube instead. You can also take a ballpoint pen apart, then use the body. Making the Trigger (Optional) Wrap the end of sturdy, metal wire around the bottom of a circle hook. Cut a length of wire that's long enough to reach from the water bottle's cap to the spray bottle's trigger, plus 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm). Wrap the end of the wire around the bottom of a circle hook to secure it. The circle hook needs to be big enough to fit over your water bottle's sports cap.

Twist the end of the wire around itself. This closes the loop and keeps it from coming undone. The loop will make the trigger. Make it big enough for your finger to slide through. Wrap it around your finger or a highlighter to ensure a good fit. Using Your Air Gun Cut some Q-tips in half. If you are using the kind that are hollow inside, you can glue some toothpicks inside to make them more lethal. Only do this if you plan on being responsible; never shoot your toothpick bullets at another person or animal. You can also use other missiles, such as lollipop sticks or toothpicks. Push a Q-tip, fuzzy-side down, into the straw. If the Q-tip won't slide into the straw easily, you'll either have to pull the cotton batting off, or cut it off with a pair of scissors. You can only load 1 Q-tip bullet at a time. Push the sports cap shut and pump the gun. Simply squeeze the spray bottle trigger repeatedly. As the small bottle fills with air, the trigger will become harder and harder to pull. Once you can't squeeze the trigger anymore, stop.
