  "text":" Preparing the Yoyo Buy a yoyo with an axle and a ball bearing. It can be difficult to make your throws sleep with an inexpensive plastic yoyo. Many yoyos on the market today are cheap, wear out easily, and rub the string with too many friction-heavy surfaces. If you are serious about practicing tricks with your yoyo, consider buying a quality yoyo. A metal ball bearing will reduce the friction grinding between the axle and the end of the string. A Duncan Butterfly or YoyoFactory F.A.S.T 201 is one example of a cheap but trick-worthy starter yo-yo. Later on, you might consider buying a more advanced, expensive brand for even longer throws. Loop the string onto your middle finger, about halfway down. Gently toss the yoyo over your hand. If you don't want to buy a bearing-axled yoyo, try customizing a cheap yoyo yourself. The best way to do this is to loosen the string that loops around the center axle of the yoyo. You can also lube the axle. Don't lube ball bearings with any lube, try get some yoyo lube. If you lube the bearing with something like WD-40, it will probably stop working! Throwing the Yoyo Hold the yoyo in a flat palm. Gently twist your palm downward and let the yoyo fall. The yoyo should start to spin once it reaches the end of the string. It should not reel back up the string. Grip the yoyo. Bend your arm backwards\u2014as though you're flexing your biceps\u2014until the yoyo is almost touching your shoulder. Prepare to push the yoyo away from you. Throw the yoyo. Quickly extend your arm at the elbow. When the arm is fully extended, flick your wrist slightly downward and turn your palm to face the ground. Practice each motion individually until you can do it all in one smooth motion. If you have a normal metal-balls-with-springs-inside type of yoyo, the quick rotational energy will release the axle, and the yoyo should start spinning.
