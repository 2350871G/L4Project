  "text":" Cleaning and Seasoning the Salmon Pull any pin bones out of the salmon. Lay the salmon on a cutting board skin-down. Run your fingers over the meat to feel for any small, hard lumps. Grasp the ends of the bones with needle-nose pliers or tweezers and pull them out at an angle. Try to pull the bones out at the angle they are pointing. Pulling them straight up will tear the fish. Cut the salmon into fillets. Use a sharp knife to divide larger pieces of salmon into fillets about 1 \u20442 to 2 in (3.8 to 5.1 cm) wide. The pieces don\u2019t have to be perfect, but try to keep them roughly the same size so they cook at the same rate. Season the fish with a sprinkle of salt. Sprinkle a pinch of kosher salt evenly on each piece of salmon. The salt will prevent the fish from sticking to the grill. Let the salmon rest for 20 minutes. Leave the salmon out so that it reaches room temperature. It\u2019s best to do this as the grill heats. If you plan on marinating your salmon, this is also the perfect time to let the salmon rest meat-side down in the marinade. You could use a basic teriyaki marinade, for example, made with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and brown sugar. Cooking the Salmon Lightly oil the grill with a paper towel. Wad up a paper towel and pour some vegetable oil onto it. Using tongs, wipe the paper towel over the grill grate. Make sure you only apply a thin coating of oil so that the fire doesn\u2019t flare up. Preheat the grill to a medium high heat. A medium-high temperature equals about 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C), if your grill has a thermometer. To test the grill later, hold your hand over it. It should feel so hot that you can only hold your hand over it for 1 second. Grill the skinless side for 5 minutes. Spread the fillets on the grill skin-side up so they all cook evenly. Avoid touching the salmon until you\u2019re ready to flip it. When the salmon is done, the meat will begin curling away from the grill. If you like the skin extra crispy, you can cook the skin side first instead. Flip the salmon with a spatula or tongs. If the salmon sticks to the grill when you try to flip it, it most likely isn\u2019t done, so let it cook for another minute. Grill the skin side for 10 minutes.
