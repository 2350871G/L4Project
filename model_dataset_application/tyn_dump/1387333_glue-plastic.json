    "Prime pipe before gluing.",
    "Of the three types of plastic pipe, PVC is the only material that requires priming, but CPVC may attach better after priming as well.",
    "Wipe PVC primer or CPVC primer as appropriate onto the outside of the pipe segment and the inside of the pipe fitting, where they will be attached.",
    "Let dry 10 seconds before continuing.",
    "Work quickly and methodically to apply the solvent cement.",
    "Wearing gloves, use a brush or cotton ball to wipe an even layer of solvent cement on the outside of the pipe segment and the inside of the pipe fitting.",
    "Only apply a thin, even layer to the fitting socket or excess may be pushed into the water piping and create blockage.",
    "Connect the pipes immediately and quarter turn from the desired alignment, then twist and hold.",
    "Directly following the application of solvent cement, attach the pipes a quarter turn from the alignment marks you made, then twist them until the marks line up.",
    "If you didn't have to make any alignment marks, simply attach and give a quarter turn twist.",
    "Hold in place for about fifteen seconds to give the cement time to grab.",
    "Correct length mistakes by sawing room for a new joint.",
    "The attachment may shrink slightly when the solvent cement dries.",
    "If your final piece is too short, saw it apart and lengthen it by gluing a new fitting onto it.",
    "If it is too long, remove a section of the pipe entirely by sawing and join the two remaining ends together with a new fitting."
