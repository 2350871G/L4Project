Then, remove the crab from the ice water and lay it on its back. Use a knife or ice pick to stab the crab through its shell 1 inch (2.5 cm) below its mouth. You can also boil the crab for 1 minute to kill it. Numb the live crab in the freezer for 15 minutes before boiling. Then, remove the crab from the freezer and drop it in a pot of boiling water. Let the crab boil for 1 minute with the pot uncovered. After 1 minute, remove the crab using tongs and submerge it in a bowl of ice water so it stops cooking."

Quartering the Crab Cut the crab in half lengthwise. Lay the crab right-side up and hold a sharp chef's knife so the blade is running down the center of the crab\u2019s body lengthwise. Push down on the top of the knife with your free hand so it makes a neat cut through the crab\u2019s body. Separate the two halves. Cut the crab into quarters. Grab one of the halves of the crab and hold the knife so the blade is positioned in the middle of the 4 legs. There should be 2 legs on each side of the knife. Press down with the knife to cut the piece of crab in half. Repeat on the other half of the crab. Store the crab on ice until you\u2019re ready to cook it. When you're ready to cook the crab, take it off the ice and boil the quartered pieces. You can also grill and roast the crab. Don't forget to add seasoning!",
