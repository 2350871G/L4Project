Take note of different types of buildings while you\u2019re out and about to get inspiration and refine your mental image, or use your imagination to come up with your own one-of-a-kind structure. If you can envision it, you can build it. If you plan on modeling a real building, take plenty of photographs so you\u2019ll have something to refer to throughout the design phase. A simple house, barn, or other traditional structure will be the easiest to create on your first attempt. As your skills improve, you might try your hand at elaborate mansions, skyscrapers, castles, and other types of buildings.Tip: Feel free to modify the design of an existing structure in any way you see fit to make it more manageable for your skill level and the materials you\u2019re working with."

It will also help you transfer the structure\u2019s individual planes onto your work materials once the time comes.

Once you\u2019ve done that, pull up a modeling scale conversion chart online and use the figures listed to translate your recorded measurements to a given scale, which you\u2019ll then use to build your model. Scales are represented as fractions that indicate how big a model is in comparison to the object it\u2019s based on. If you\u2019re building your model to a 1/125 scale, for instance, it means that it would take 125 of your model lined up end-to-end to equal the length of the actual building. You may be able to look up the exact dimensions of a given structure in your local building records. Run a quick search for \u201cbuilding records\u201d plus the name of your town or city and the name or address of the building you\u2019re looking for to pull up its original building plans."

You can also use styrene, mat board, gel foam, or balsa wood instead of cardstock. Some of these materials may vary in terms of cost and durability, but all are soft enough to cut and shape easily.

Rather than trying to force the blade through the material, use light pressure and make multiple passes, gently snapping the piece free by hand afterwards. You may need to go back over your outlines several times if you\u2019re working with a stronger material like styrene or wood. Place a piece of scrap cardboard underneath your materials to protect your work surface. If you\u2019re thinking about getting into modeling seriously, a self-healing cutting mat could also make a wise investment. A pen-style knife will offer greater precision and control than one with a wider handle.Warning: Be careful and pay close attention anytime you pick up your utility knife. The blade will be extremely sharp, and even the slightest slip could result in accident or injury."

Then, turn your material, reset your knife, and score the next side of the outline. When you\u2019ve done each side, press down on the excess material at the center of the opening to free it from the surrounding piece. If for some reason you\u2019re having trouble, another option is to extend your cuts all the way to the edges of the piece, snap them apart manually, and glue them back together without the material from the openings. Scoring your doors and windows in this way will also produce cleaner openings, since you won't be over-cutting into the surrounding material."

          "description":"It can be difficult to neatly piece together a roof from lots of small pieces. A much simpler solution is to draw an additional line onto the outline for your roof piece where the two sides will come together, then fold the cardstock along the line to form the point of the roof. If you\u2019re using styrene, wood, or gel foam, make a shallow cut down your roof point line and bend the sections of material on either side away from one another to create a hinge. This technique works best for basic gable, gambrel, and skillion roofs made up of only a couple planes. If you\u2019ve chosen a more complex roof style for your model, you may have no choice but to cut and paste."

          "description":"The friction of cutting and scoring will begin to dull your cutting tool after a while. When you begin encountering resistance or notice that your cuts feel rough, stop what you\u2019re doing and very carefully remove the blade you\u2019re currently working with. Replace the dull blade with a fresh one and get back to it\u2014you\u2019ll feel the difference right away. If you\u2019re using a retractable utility knife, open up the casing and lift out the old blade by its rear edge to avoid cutting yourself accidentally. Some newer blades come loaded with pre-notched blades, which make it possible to snap off the dull section and extend a brand new, ultra-sharp tip. Cutting with a dull blade can tire you out quickly, and is much more likely to damage your work materials."

Line up the glued edge with the corresponding edge of the neighboring piece and press and hold the two edges together. Allow the glue to dry for 15-20 seconds before letting go and moving on to the next piece. You can also use a hot glue gun, super glue, or ordinary white glue on wood and most types of cardstock and board. To streamline the gluing process, start by putting the outer walls in place around the floor piece, then attach any interior walls you wish to include, saving the roof for last.Tip: Gluing is one of the most time-consuming parts of model-building, but also one of the most important.

Be careful not to crush, bend, or otherwise damage the underlying material. Pinch the clay gently where the separate planes of your model come together to create sharper corners and edges.

You can also use your utility knife to \u201cdraw\u201d on roof tiles, window sills, roof flashing, and other realistic features.

You\u2019ll need gray for raw stone, dark red for brick, brown or tan for wood, black for roofing tiles, silver for metal, bright colors for siding, shutters, and other painted portions, and so on. If you used air dry clay to cover your model, you\u2019ll need to heat-cure the clay before you apply paint. To do this, place the model in the oven on its lowest setting for 15-20 minutes at a time, allowing the oven to cool completely between rounds to prevent the clay from burning. Continue in this way until it feels dry and solid to the touch. Acrylic, tempera, or poster paint is usually the best choice for applying to clay."

    "You\u2019ll need gray for raw stone, dark red for brick, brown or tan for wood, black for roofing tiles, silver for metal, bright colors for siding, shutters, and other painted portions, and so on.",
    "If you used air dry clay to cover your model, you\u2019ll need to heat-cure the clay before you apply paint.",
    "To do this, place the model in the oven on its lowest setting for 15-20 minutes at a time, allowing the oven to cool completely between rounds to prevent the clay from burning.",
    "Continue in this way until it feels dry and solid to the touch.",
    "Acrylic, tempera, or poster paint is usually the best choice for applying to clay."
