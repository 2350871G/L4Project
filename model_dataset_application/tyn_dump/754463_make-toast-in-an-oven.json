Toast has the best texture right after you make it, but you can store it in an airtight container for up to 1 day. Quick-Toasting Using the Broiler Lay slices of bread on the rack below the broiler. Adjust the oven rack so it's about 3 inches (7.6 cm) below the broiler's heating element. Then, place as many slices of bread as you want to toast directly onto the rack. Leave at least \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of space between each slice of bread so they heat evenly. Turn the broiler to \"Low.\" If your broiler has several settings, choose the lowest heat setting. If your broiler doesn't have different settings, simply turn the broiler on. Wait until you've put the bread under the broiler before turning it on. It's also important to stay next to the broiler while toasting the bread because it can burn quickly. Broil the toast for 60 to 90 seconds.
