Make sure that you are using a melt-and-pour soap base and not a regular bar of soap. Goat's milk soap is recommended for this method, but you can also use a different melt-and-pour soap base, such as shea butter."

If you are using plastic molds, however, consider lightly greasing them with coconut oil. This will make the soap easier to remove once it sets up. If you are using a plain soap making mold, consider placing a soap making stamp in the bottom, design-side-up."

Grapefruit essential oil is recommended for this method, but if you don't have any, or just don't like it, you can use another type of essential oil instead.

If you add too much liquid, your soap won't set up properly and will take too long to dry once it is made. If your soap is scented, consider turning the stove fan on or opening up a window.

Eventually, the soap will reach its final consistency, and not soften any more. At this point, turn off the burner, and take the saucepan off the stove. Be patient during this step; it can take up to 2 to 3 hours for the soap to reach this stage. Do not allow the soap to burn. If it starts to burn, lower the heat, and add a little cold water.

If your spoon or spatula are sticking to the soap too much, sprinkle more salt on top of the soap, then try again. The salt will help create a barrier between the soap and the spoon, as well as add texture. You can use silicone or plastic soap molds for this. If you are using plastic molds, consider lightly greasing them with coconut oil first. This will make it easier to pop the soaps out later on. Consider adding a sprinkle of lavender flowers to the bottom of your mold, before you add the soap. This will give your soap a nice texture.
