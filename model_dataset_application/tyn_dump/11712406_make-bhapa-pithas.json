Transfer the soaked rice to a cloth or baking rack and spread the rice evenly. Place the rice in a warm, dry area and allow it to dry completely. Take the rice and grind it down to a coarse powder once it's dry. Do this in either a grinder or a food processor. Sift the flour into a clean bowl so that there are no big clumps in the flour. As an alternative, you can use store bought rice flour. Take two cups of store bought rice flour and grind it in either a grinder or food processor to make sure it is a coarse powder. Sift the flour into a clean bowl so that there are no big clumps in the flour."

You want the rice flour to be moist, but not so wet that it combines together and becomes a homogeneous dough. You want the rice flour to be able to somewhat crumble.

When the pithas are ready for cooking, bring your homemade steamer to the stove and bring the water in your saucepan steamer to a boil. If using a bamboo steamer, line the layer you are going to put the pithas in with lettuce or cloth so that the pithas do not stick to the bamboo. Fill a pot with about 3 inches (8 cm) of water and let it come to a simmer. Make sure that you bamboo steamer either sits on top of the pot or fits snugly in the pot over the water line. Once you are ready to steam the pithas, place them in the bamboo steamer, place that over/in the pot. Add 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of water to the pot if you see if starting to dry out.
