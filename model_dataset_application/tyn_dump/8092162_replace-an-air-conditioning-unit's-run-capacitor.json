  "text":" Turning Off Power to AC Set the thermostat control to the off position.  Locate the 220v breaker box. It should be located close to your AC compressor. This feeds the unit the voltage necessary for it to run. Often you will see a cable running from this breaker box directly to the AC compressor. Open the breaker box panel. There is a latch on the box (either on the side or bottom) that unlocks it. Once the door is in the open position, push it in slightly and it should lock in place. Remove the breaker by pulling it straight back by the handle. Set the breaker aside in a safe place. Locating and Inspecting the Run Capacitor Locate the side panel of your AC unit.  Unscrew the bolts and remove the side panel. Use the appropriate bit with a bit driver to remove the screws. Typically there are four 5/16\" hex screws that attach the side panel to the rest of the unit. Place the screws in a secure location so as not to lose any. Locate the current run capacitor but do not touch it (the capacitor must be discharged before it is safe to handle). It will have a cylindrical, canister-like shape. It will have three terminals on top. There will be colored wires coming from the AC Unit to some if not all of the terminals on the capacitor. Inspect run capacitor to see if it needs to be replaced.
