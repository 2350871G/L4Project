Make sure to follow your knitting pattern's specifications if you are using one.

To do an invisible join, start by casting on 1 more stitch after you finish casting on the required stitches for your project. Cast this stitch onto the needle in your left hand so that it is right next to the last stitch you cast on. Slip the first stitch onto the left hand needle. Next, take the first stitch on your right hand needle and slip it onto the left hand needle. The first stitch on your right hand needle will be the one with the tail of yarn extending from it.
