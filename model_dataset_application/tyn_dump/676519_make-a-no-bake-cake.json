  "text":" Oreo Cookie No-Bake Cake Prep your cake board. Either use a pre-made cake board or place plastic wrap over cardboard as a base for your cake. Stack the chocolate cookies in layers. Alternate each cookie layer with a whipped cream layer. Note: You can opt to remove the creamy filling in the Oreo cookies before making this cake. If this is done, mix the removed Oreo filling with whipped cream, then add this between the layers instead. Coat the cake when you're done stacking the cake. Spread the sides with whipped cream, to cover and hide the inner cookies and cream. Cover the resulting no-bake cake in an airtight container or saran wrap. Place it in the freezer to freeze it for four to six hours. Thaw in the refrigerator for an hour.  Serve. Finally it's done; take it out and enjoy! Slice it as for any cake. No-Bake \u00c9clair Cake Place the pudding mix and milk into a mixing bowl. Beat to combine. Stir in the Cool Whip.  Line the base of the dish with graham crackers. Break in order to fit neatly across the base. Spread half of the pudding mixture across the crackers. Use a spatula to ensure that it is distributed evenly. Add another layer of graham crackers. Repeat with another layer of pudding mix, finishing it off. Use a spatula to ensure that it is distributed evenly. Add one more layer of graham crackers.  Place the cocoa powder, milk and sugar in the saucepan. Bring to a full rolling boil, then boil for a minute, stirring often. Remove from the heat. Allow to cool for a minute. Add the butter and vanilla extract. Stir to melt in the butter. Pour the cooled topping over the final layer of graham crackers. Use a spatula to ensure that it is distributed evenly. Cover with plastic food wrap or similar. Place the cake into the refrigerator to set. Either leave for 8 hours, or overnight. Serve. Slice as for a normal cake. No-Bake Fruit Cake Choose the fruits. You will be needing 2 1/2 cups (or enough to fill a cake pan of choice) of chopped, mixed fruit or 1 can of canned fruit salad or fruit cocktail. Fruits good for this include: pineapple, mango, papaya, and cherries. Or, you can substitute fruits depending on your location. Crush the graham crackers until they are almost in a fine dust. You may want to use a mortar and pestle for this, but any type of pounding utensil is good. Prepare the jello mix. Follow the instructions that come with the jello package. The traditional color is clear, but you can use other colors. Pour the crushed graham crackers on the cake pan. Make sure that there is enough to cover the bottom in an even layer. It should be about \u20443 inch (0.8 cm) in thickness at the least. Place the mixed fruits in an even layer on top of the graham crackers.  Pour the jello mix on top. The idea is that you want the jello to mix with the fruits, without disturbing the layer of graham crackers. Drizzle the condensed milk on top of the cake. Since condensed milk is very sweet and sometimes used as a substitute for sugar, you should use it sparingly, and only for flavor. Take the cake, and place it in the refrigerator to set. This should take about an hour, but you want to leave it there as long as possible in order to get it to be somewhat stable. It's a good idea to cover the cake with plastic food wrap or a lid before placing in the refrigerator. Finished.  No-Bake Almond and Raisin cake Crush the plain sweet biscuits into a fine powder. There shouldn't be any chunks of biscuits left. Melt the chocolate, approximately 1/2 the amount of powdered biscuits. Melt over a double boiler or in the microwave oven. Add the melted chocolate to the powdered biscuits. Stir thoroughly to combine. If you are using dark chocolate, mix some milk while melting it. If needed, you can also add some sugar while melting it. Mix the melted chocolate and the powdered biscuits together with enough water to form a spongy dough. The mixture shouldn't be liquid, but held together with a spongy dough-like consistency. Shape the cake into a little mound on each plate. Apply whipped cream to the top, if you want. Decorate it with chopped raisins and almonds, as many as desired.  Refrigerate the cake. Remove from the refrigerator to serve. If preferred, you can bring it back to room temperature for serving. Finished. Experiment with adding other nuts or dried fruits to find your favorite version. No-Bake Chocolate Biscuit Cake Crumble the sweet biscuits into a large bowl.  Place the non-stick pan onto medium high heat. Add the chosen nuts and toast for 3 to 5 minutes. Avoid burning them. Remove from the heat and add to the biscuits in the bowl.  Add the sugar and cocoa powder to the saucepan. Heat gently over medium heat, stirring and gradually adding water. Add the butter and stir through. Bring to the boil for 7 to 8 minutes. Continue to stir as the mixture boils, then remove from the heat. Add the vanilla extract to the mixture. Put to one side to cool for 1/4 of an hour. When it has cooled, pour it over the biscuit and nut mixture. Stir to mix well. Press the chocolate syrup biscuit and nut base mixture into the cake pan. Use your fingers, the back or a spoon or a spatula to press evenly across the base of the cake pan. Place an upturned plate or plastic food wrap/foil over the base. Put the base into the refrigerator to set. Leave to chill for half an hour to an hour. Chop the chocolate into rough, small pieces. Leave in a bowl large enough to add the cream to shortly. Pour the cream into the small saucepan. Heat over a medium heat to just boiling point. Remove from the heat. Pour onto the chopped chocolate. Allow it to sit on the chocolate to melt it, then stir through to form a smooth paste. Remove the set base from the refrigerator.  Pour the chocolate ganache over the base. Ensure that it fills across the base evenly. Cover again, as before, without marring the chocolate ganache. Return the cake to the refrigerator to set. It is best if allowed to set overnight but if you need it faster, leave it to chill for at least three to four hours. Garnish before serving. Sprinkle nuts and small pieces of chopped dried fruit over the top of the no-bake cake. To serve, cut into slices and place onto individual plates.",
