If you can\u2019t see any screws in the strainer, then this makes your job even easier! Simply pry the strainer away from the drain using your fingers.

Try to apply an even bead of caulk around the whole opening, as this gives a smoother and more effective finish. Aim to complete the whole bead in 1 pass. Refitting the Drain and Curing the Caulk Screw the drain body back on. Get the clean shower drain body and place it into the drain. Use your hands to twist the drain body clockwise and tighten it as much as you can.
