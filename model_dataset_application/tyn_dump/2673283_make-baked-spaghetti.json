    "A 12 in (30 cm) skillet is the perfect size for this recipe.",
    "Place the ground beef in the skillet and cook it for 5 to 7 minutes.",
    "Push the 1 pound (0.45 kg) of meat around the skillet with a spatula while it cooks so that it browns evenly.",
    "There shouldn\u2019t be any pink spots left when it\u2019s done.",
    "Wash your hands with soap and warm water if you touch the raw meat so you don\u2019t spread any harmful bacteria.",
    "Drain the ground beef and mix the spaghetti sauce into the skillet.",
    "After straining extra grease and fat off of the meat, pour the 16 oz (0.45 kg) jar of spaghetti sauce in with the beef.",
    "Stir it with a spoon to combine the 2 ingredients.",
    "Don\u2019t pour the grease from the beef down the sink.",
    "Instead, put it in a plastic container until it cools.",
    "Then toss it in the trash.",
    "You can use any flavor of spaghetti sauce that you like, or make your own.",
    "Combine the cottage cheese, sour cream, and cream cheese in a bowl.",
    "Mix together 8 ounces (0.23 kg) of cottage cheese, \u20444 cup (59 ml) of sour cream, and 8 oz (0.23 kg) of cream cheese.",
    "Use a spoon or electric mixer to stir the ingredients until they\u2019re thoroughly combined.",
    "Easy Ways to Make Baked Spaghetti Healthier\nFor more protein, substitute Greek yogurt for the sour cream.",
    "If you want a lower fat dish, use ground beef with a lower fat percentage or swap it for ground turkey.",
    "To add antioxidants and vitamins, toss cooked veggies, like broccoli, mushrooms, or green peppers, in with the sauce.",
    "If you're trying to eat less dairy, cut the amount of cheese you sprinkle on top in half or skip it all together.",
    "For a gluten-free meal, opt for gluten-free pasta or veggie noodles.",
    "Keep in mind that veggie noodles will require a shorter cooking time.",
    "Arrange \u20444 cup (59 ml) of sliced butter in the bottom of a casserole dish.",
    "Place the pats of butter around the dish so that when they melt in the oven, they\u2019ll cover the entire bottom.",
    "The thinner you slice the butter, the more evenly you\u2019ll be able to cover the dish.",
    "Use any size pan, or even skillet, that you\u2019d like.",
    "Typically, this recipe is baked in a 13 in \u00d7 9 in (33 cm \u00d7 23 cm) casserole dish.",
    "You don\u2019t need to grease or spray the dish.",
    "The butter will prevent the spaghetti from sticking to the bottom or burning.",
    "Lay 1/2 of the spaghetti in the dish, then add the creamy mixture.",
    "Measure out about 1/2 of the pasta, leaving the other half to the side.",
    "Transfer it to the dish on top of the butter slices.",
    "Then distribute the cottage cheese mixture evenly across the noodles.",
    "It may help to divide the spaghetti evenly in 2 bowls to better approximate how much is 1/2 of the noodles.",
    "Otherwise, you could end up with not enough pasta for the top of the casserole.",
    "Use the back of a spoon to spread the cottage cheese mixture easily.",
    "Place the remaining half of the spaghetti on top of the creamy layer.",
    "Once you\u2019ve finished spreading out the cottage cheese mixture, add the rest of the noodles.",
    "Set them gently into the dish so that they cover the creamy layer.",
    "If your hands are clean, use them to lay the noodles on top.",
    "You\u2019ll have more control than if you use a spoon.",
    "Top the spaghetti with the ground beef and sauce mixture.",
    "This is your final layer.",
    "Pour the meat and sauce over all of the noodles, making sure you don\u2019t leave any exposed.",
    "Any dry noodles that go into the oven will burn.",
    "Use a ladle to scoop the sauce over the top of the spaghetti as an alternative to just dumping it.",
    "It can help you evenly distribute the mixture.",
    "Place the dish in the oven to bake for 30 minutes.",
    "Your casserole will cook the most evenly if you set it on the middle rack.",
    "That\u2019s allows the hot air to circulate around the entire dish.",
    "Set a kitchen timer or use the clock app on your phone to keep track of the time.",
    "Take the dish out of the oven and sprinkle cheddar cheese on top.",
    "You can either use pre-shredded cheese, or shred it yourself.",
    "Coat the entire casserole evenly with 2 cups (470 ml) of the cheddar cheese.",
    "If you don\u2019t like cheddar cheese, substitute it for the cheese of your choice, like mozzarella or colby jack.",
    "Return the dish to the oven for another 10 minutes before removing it.",
    "This allows the cheese to melt over top of the casserole.",
    "Don\u2019t leave it in for longer than 10 minutes or the spaghetti will be dry and overcooked.",
    "If you like crispier, browner cheese, turn on the broiler for the last 5 minutes.",
    "Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for no more than 4 days."
