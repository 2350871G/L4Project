          "description":"Plug the slow cooker into a nearby electrical outlet and let it run. Keep the slow cooker at a low heat setting to avoid overcooking the food. It\u2019s a hands-free way to keep food warm while guests help themselves. Slow cookers are the best choice for simmering soups and stews, but they work well for most food. Most slow cookers have a low heat or \u201cwarm\u201d setting. Choose the lowest setting possible on your model. Slow cookers will continue to cook your food if you set them at the wrong temperature. The downside of using a slow cooker is that you need to have an electrical outlet handy. Make sure you have an open outlet in an out of the way spot. A rice cooker is another option for heating rice-based dishes and other sides."

          "headline":"Try a portable oven if you need to keep solid food warm.",
          "description":"Portable ovens and roaster ovens are an efficient way to heat up foods from meats to pizzas. You need an electrical outlet available. Plug the oven in, then set it to a low temperature, around 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C), to keep food warm. Small ovens are similar to slow cookers in that they keep food warm at a low temperature. Setting the oven at a higher temperature by mistake will overcook the food. Toaster ovens are a good option even if you have a regular oven available. Use them to efficiently reheat or maintain food instead of dealing with a bigger, hotter oven."

          "headline":"Use indirect heat from a grill if you need to preserve larger dishes.",
          "description":"Using a grill is a great way to keep meat like hamburgers and hot dogs warm, although it works for side dishes like potatoes or casseroles too. Heat up 1 side of the grill to a low temperature. Seal the food in foil to help it retain heat and moisture, then set it on the colder side of the grill so it stays warm without overcooking. Use a thermometer to monitor the grill\u2019s temperature. Heating up the grill too much is an easy mistake to make. When setting food on the grill, make sure you use heat-resistant pans and containers."

You pour hot water into the bottom part of the dish. Then, you activate the gas canister or electrical heating unit underneath the dish to keep the food at a steady temperature. If you serve food at lots of parties, chafing dishes are a worthy investment. They are available online or at some party supply stores. An alternative option is to rent them from catering companies. Choose dishes based on what you\u2019re serving. For example, rectangular and oval-shaped dishes are often best for meats or other main courses. Use a round dish or soup dish for liquids. For gas units, you will need a small canister of fuel, available at most party supply stores and general stores. Light the canister with a match or the switch on some chafing dish models."

Gas and electric trays are both available to suit your party\u2019s needs. Some warming trays are completely flat. Instead of putting the food in a compartment, you set the food in a dish on top of the tray. Warming trays are often smaller than chafing dishes, so unless you serve smaller quantities of food, they\u2019re a better option for sides and appetizers like small portions of meat, potatoes, and vegetables than entrees and liquid dishes."

Place something like a bowl of potatoes on the burner, then turn its dial to a low temperature to preserve it. Some heating plates have 2 burners, allowing you to heat up multiple dishes at once. They still don\u2019t offer a lot of space for each dish, so keep that in mind when planning your party. Microwavable hot plates are also available. Heat them in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, then set food on top of them."

Well-covered food will stay warm, but the towels help trap heat in the food you need to store for up to a few hours. Another option is to wrap bricks in foil.

Then, turn the oven to about 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and heat the food until it\u2019s warm again. This is a good way to reheat pre-cooked meats. For example, add warm turkey stock to turkey breast and heat it for about 30 minutes. For fish and smaller cuts of meat, you don\u2019t need to add water or stock. Set them in the pan and heat them until fully warmed (about 15 to 20 minutes). Side dishes like vegetable trays and casseroles can be heated in the oven the same way. Leave them in at  350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) for about 15 minutes."

Keep stirring it to prevent it from boiling and overheating. Side dishes like mashed potatoes are a little trickier to heat up this way. Add milk or broth to bring the food to the consistency you desire, then keep stirring it until it\u2019s hot."

Loosely cover the dish with its lid or plastic wrap. Reheat the food for about 4 minutes, then take it out and stir it. Heat it for another 3 minutes until it reaches 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). Microwaves heat food unevenly, so you need to monitor the food\u2019s temperature. Heat the food in slow bursts, stirring it each time to help it warm up evenly. Microwave are not a good choice for most meat. They tend to turn meat flabby and gray. They also cannot crisp up food like fries."

Warm plates heat up food a little, causing slightly cooled food to still taste great. Put thick, dishwasher-safe plates in the dishwasher to heat them. Leave clay plates in for up to 2 hours to ready them for the party."

Plug the heating pad into a wall outlet, then set the serving tray on top of it. It\u2019s a good way to keep plates of food warm after you serve them, including larger dishes like sliced ham or turkey. Electric blankets work similarly to heating pads. Plug them into the wall and let them heat up to spread more warmth to your food. Heated gel packs are another option.

    "Pour the food from a serving bowl into a saucepan.",
    "Turn the stove to a medium heat setting and wait for the liquid to begin to bubble slightly.",
    "Keep stirring it to prevent it from boiling and overheating.",
    "Side dishes like mashed potatoes are a little trickier to heat up this way.",
    "Add milk or broth to bring the food to the consistency you desire, then keep stirring it until it\u2019s hot.",
    "Microwave smaller sides that don\u2019t need to be crisped.",
    "Smaller quantities of food and sides like vegetables, potatoes, and macaroni and cheese do well in the microwave.",
    "Move them into a microwave-safe dish.",
    "Loosely cover the dish with its lid or plastic wrap.",
    "Reheat the food for about 4 minutes, then take it out and stir it.",
    "Heat it for another 3 minutes until it reaches 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C).",
    "Microwaves heat food unevenly, so you need to monitor the food\u2019s temperature.",
    "Heat the food in slow bursts, stirring it each time to help it warm up evenly.",
    "Microwave are not a good choice for most meat.",
    "They tend to turn meat flabby and gray.",

    "Heat the plates at a temperature of 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C) for about 15 minutes.",
    "Warm plates heat up food a little, causing slightly cooled food to still taste great.",
    "Put thick, dishwasher-safe plates in the dishwasher to heat them.",
    "Leave clay plates in for up to 2 hours to ready them for the party.",
    "Use a heating pad if you need to keep served plates of food warm.",
    "If you are short on heating options, set an electric heating pad between towels or heat-resistant mats.",
    "Plug the heating pad into a wall outlet, then set the serving tray on top of it.",
    "It\u2019s a good way to keep plates of food warm after you serve them, including larger dishes like sliced ham or turkey.",
    "Electric blankets work similarly to heating pads.",
    "Plug them into the wall and let them heat up to spread more warmth to your food.",
    "Heated gel packs are another option.",
