  "text":" Gather a group of people together. Your group should be no smaller than 7 people, as it is too difficult to play after this point. Find a standard deck of 52 cards (it can include jokers).  Decide how many murderers you should have. For a small group, you should only need one, for a group of twenty or so, you can go as high as two or three murderers. From the deck of cards, pick out one card  for each person playing the game. There needs to be a special card for each murderer, such as an ace or a king. Take this pile of cards and place them face down in the center of the room in which you are playing.  Have everyone pick a card from the pile. They cannot show or tell anyone what their card is. Have them place their cards back in the pile. The person (or people) with the special identification cards is (are) the murder(s). Explain that those who are the murderers must indicate to a person that they are being murdered when a pair of hands are placed around their neck in a strangling motion.  Have everyone gather in a circle, on their hands and knees. Everyone must be quiet, and somebody must be near the door to turn off the lights. Turn off the lights and start crawling around.  The murderer(s) will also be crawling around, silently choking people when the lights are off.  Now comes the fun part. If you come across someone lying on the ground, yell \"Body!
