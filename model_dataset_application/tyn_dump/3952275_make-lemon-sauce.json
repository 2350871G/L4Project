  "text":" Traditional Lemon Sauce Combine all ingredients in a transparent microwave-safe bowl. Preferably it'll have a matching lid if you mean to save any for later. If it doesn't, you'll need to cover the top with a paper towel to keep the liquid from getting all over the place. Stir until the cornstarch is evenly dispersed, forming a cloudy mixture. The sugar and butter will not dissolve immediately. Once you have a uniform consistency, your bowl is ready for heating. Cover the bowl loosely to avoid spattering the microwave. Loosely though! You don't want any pressure to build up and the top be blown right off. You are bringing the contents to a boil, so make sure there's room for air to escape. Microwave at full power to heat but not boil. This should take about three minutes for a single batch. Give it a quick stir and return it to the microwave. If it starts to boil, take it out of the microwave and let it cool down for about 30 seconds. Then stir it and place it back in. Microwave to bring to a boil, about two minutes.

Keep the leftovers in the fridge in a resealable container to use for later; it'll keep for a few weeks. Combine the cold water, cornstarch and sugar.
