If you lack bees or other pollinating insects in your area, or if your zucchini plant doesn\u2019t seem to be producing any squash, you can pollinate your plant on your own. Pick a male zucchini flower, identifiable by its long stem, slender stem, and a visible stamen in the center. Carefully pull back the blossoms on the stem, and rub the stamen inside a female zucchini flower. Female zucchini flowers have short stems, a bulbous growth where the flower meets the stem, and lack stamens.

Therefore, if you want lots of the squash, then pick all the zucchinis as they reach maturity. If you don\u2019t have a need for too many squash, leave one or two zucchinis on the vine for the whole growing season to slow down the production. To harvest your zucchini, use a sharp knife to sever the squash from the rough stem that attaches it to the bush. Enjoy the flowers in salads. These are edible and if you pick them, there won't be so many zucchini fruits growing. Crops will continue to grow until the first frosts if they established well during spring. You can simply cut the stem of a zucchini to promote growth, if you don\u2019t want to harvest all of your squash yet."
