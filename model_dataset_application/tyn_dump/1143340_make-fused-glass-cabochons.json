The clear cap needs to be larger than the base as the dichroic layer can sometimes seep out under the clear glass. Be careful when stacking the glasses. Dichroic glass surfaces should not face each other because they do not bond well. Layer your glass as a gold dichroic (black base), stringers (transparent), ripple (transparent), and cover glass (clear cap)."

  "text":" Making Dichroic Fused Glass Cabochons Place the shelf paper on the kiln shelf. Assemble your glass pieces with the glass cap placed evenly on top of the dichroic, with the dichroic layer facing up. The clear cap needs to be larger than the base as the dichroic layer can sometimes seep out under the clear glass. Be careful when stacking the glasses. Dichroic glass surfaces should not face each other because they do not bond well. Layer your glass as a gold dichroic (black base), stringers (transparent), ripple (transparent), and cover glass (clear cap). Set the temperature on the kiln. If you\u2019re using a manual kiln, set the temperature to medium for about 15 minutes. Bring up to 1500\u00b0F (815\u00b0C) per hour and hold for 10 minutes.

After annealing the glass, turn the kiln off and wait until the glass is fully cooled before removing. For programmable kilns, you will be able to include these steps in your firing schedule. Use a saw to trim irregular edges. After the fused glass has cooled, you can use a tile saw, a glass saw, or a ring saw to trim those edges. Use the saw to then cut the fused glass into a variety of different shapes, sizes, and pieces. Take the pieces you cut, smooth the edge, and fire polish. Grind the edges of the pieces with a saw with a 600 grit bit to smooth down harsh, sharp edges. Rinse the cabochon in water. Place it back into the kiln and fire it at full ramp to a target of 1350 degrees, holding it for 10-15 minutes. Afterwards, allow the cabochons to cool completely between several hours to a full day. Making Fused Glass Puddles Gather your glass pieces together. Place a stack of seven 1/8\u201d thick layers of 3x3\u201d glass in your kiln.

    "Soak the pieces for 20-30 minutes, shake them in their container gently, and remove the puddle cabochons from the vinegar.",
    "Shelf primer should easily rinse away after a soak.",
    "If it doesn\u2019t, soak them again for a longer time until you notice the shelf primer is completely gone.",
    "Remove any devitrification with a sandblaster.",
    "If you don\u2019t have any access to a sandblaster, light devitrification can removed from the tops of cabochon puddles with glass etching cream.",
    "Coat the puddles with cream for 30 minutes and then rinse them clean.",
    "Return sandblasted or etched cabochon puddles to the kiln.",
    "A final fire polish is the last step to finishing your puddles.",
    "Because it\u2019s providing a polish to the puddles, holding times during most segments are obsolete.",
    "For the first firing segment, have a ramp of 500 degrees Fahrenheit an hour with a target of 1000 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "Do not hold once it\u2019s met its target.",
    "For the second firing segment, have a full ramp with a target of 1400 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "Do not hold it.",
    "For the third firing segment, have a full ramp with a target of 950 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "Hold it for 30 minutes.",
    "For the fourth firing segment, have a ramp of 300 degrees Fahrenheit an hour with a target of 725 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "Do not hold it.",
    "Remove the finished cabochon puddles.",
    "When the firing is complete and the kiln has cooled, remove the cabochon puddles from the kiln.",
    "Your jewelry components are done and ready to be used.",
    "Be mindful that it can take several hours to a full day for the cooling to be complete.",
    "Fusing Bullseye Cabochons Apply even pressure as you make a firm, clean cut.",
    "Hold your glass cutter like a pen and cut a straight line onto your glass.",
    "Cut towards you if you are making straight lines.",
    "Cut away from you if you are cutting curved lines.",
    "Snap straight cuts by using breaking pliers.",
    "Alternatively, you can hold the piece of glass at either side of the cut you\u2019ve made and snap the glass apart that way too.",
    "Tap curved cuts at the back of the glass along the score line until it begins to break.",
    "Assemble pieces together to prepare them for the kiln.",
    "Create designs with 2-3 layers of 1.6 mm thick glass, either all different colors or in a pattern.",
    "Place them onto the kiln about 10 mm apart so that they can spread without interfering with the other fusing glasses on the kiln.",
    "Add small amounts of the PVA/water mix (half PVA glue, half water) to the glass to help them stick together and to prevent displacement when you move them around.",
    "Make sure that the glue is dried completely before you turn on the kiln to begin firing the pieces.",
    "Consider the location of the glass pieces you place on the kiln.",
    "For example, if you want squarer cabochons, position the glass closer to the front where the kiln is cooler.",
    "Place the glass pieces into the kiln.",
    "Fire up the kiln and begin firing the pieces at different ramps and temperatures to make the glass pieces fuse together and create the bullseye cabochons.",
    "If you have an automatic kiln, enter the numbers below and the kiln will do the work.",
    "Otherwise, adjust the segments manually.",
    "For the first segment, have the ramp at 222C at the target temperature of 677C, and hold it for 30 minutes.",
    "For the second segment, have the ramp at 333C at the target temperature of 816C, and hold it for 10 minutes.",
    "For the third segment, have the ramp at full at the target temperature of 516C, and hold it for 30 minutes.",
    "For the fourth segment, have the ramp at 83C at the target temperature of 371C, and do not hold it.",
    "This is a rapid fire.",
    "For the fifth segment, have the ramp at full at the target temperature of 80C, and again do not hold it.",
    "This is another rapid fire.",
    "Allow the fused pieces to cool afterwards.",
    "Be aware that it can take hours for it to cool completely."
