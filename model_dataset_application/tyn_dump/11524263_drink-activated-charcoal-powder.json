Since you're taking activated charcoal powder as a treatment, opt for clear liquids like fruit juice or water. Get your drink ready several hours after your last meal, so your stomach is empty. If you drink activated charcoal powder with food, you might end up feeling constipated later on. Since activated charcoal powder works as a bonding agent, it can bond and neutralize the nutrients in your food if you take it with a meal. Mix at least 10 millilitres (0.34  fl oz) of water or juice to dissolve your dose of activated charcoal powder."

Always double-check the glass to make sure you've drunk all the dissolved charcoal. If you don't drink the entire dosage, the powder might not be as effective."
