The test will tell you if your soil has the right pH (acidity and alkalinity) balance to grow grass. Grass will do the best in dirt with a pH that falls between 6.0 and 7.5. If you fall below 6.0, then add some lime to boost your numbers. If you are above 7.5, then some peat moss should lower it. If you are short on time, there are also DIY testing kits available.

Check that your blade is sharp or you may be tearing the grass out by the roots, instead of trimming it. Consider leaving the grass clippings where they lie, rather than bagging them and throwing them away. The clippings act as a natural mulch and encourage better grass growth.
