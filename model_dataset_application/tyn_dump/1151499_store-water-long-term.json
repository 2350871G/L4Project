Increase this number to 1.5 gallons (5.5 L) per person or more for children, nursing mothers, and sick people, and for anyone in a hot or high-altitude climate. Based on these numbers, try to store a 2 week supply for your household. In case of an emergency evacuation, store a 3 day supply in easily transportable containers. For example, 2 healthy adults and 1 child need (1 gallon or 3.8 liters / adult) x (2 adults) + (1.5 gal or 5.7 liters / child) x (1 child) = 3.5 gallons (13.25 liters) per day. A 2 week supply of water for this household is (3.5 gallons or 13.25 liters/ day) x (14 days) = 49 gallons (185.5 liters). A 3 day supply would be (3.5 gallons or 13.25 liters/day) x (3 days) = 10.5 gallons (40 liters)."

If you cannot boil the water, or do not want to lose water by boiling it, bleach is the next best option:\nMix in \u00bd tsp (2.5 mL) of unscented, additive-free bleach for every 5 gallons (19 liters) of water. Double the amount of bleach if the water is cloudy or discolored. Let the water sit for half an hour. If you cannot smell a faint chlorine scent, repeat treatment and let sit another 15 minutes. In an emergency, you can also disinfect small amounts of water with water purification tablets. However, use these sparingly, as excessive use can impair thyroid function."
