Imagine that the loose end of the rope, which you're holding in your right hand, is the \"rabbit\". The rabbit comes up the hole, runs around the tree, and goes back down the hole. The loose short end of the rope serves to secure your leg. The long end will loop around the other leg, and will eventually become the \"crosspiece\" to which you clip the carabiner."
