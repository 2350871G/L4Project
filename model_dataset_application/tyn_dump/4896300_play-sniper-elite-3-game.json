      "description":"It\u2019s easy enough to line an Axis soldier\u2019s head up in your rifle scope, but before you can do that you need to know where that head actually is. It\u2019s vital that you recon any new area you visit before you start building your body count. Ideally, you\u2019ll do this from an elevated location that gives you a look at the larger area, but there\u2019s typically some amount of sneaking to be done in Sniper Elite 3 before you get to an overlook. Make use of your binoculars is key when spotting. Even the stock binoculars have a much stronger zoom than any of the game\u2019s four sniper rifles do, and you can upgrade the zoom range even further by picking up certain collectibles. Once you\u2019ve spotted an enemy through your binoculars, press RT to tag him. Note however that you can only have a certain number of enemies tagged at any one time. Look at the bottom-center of the screen when you\u2019re peering through the binoculars to see how many tags you have active and how many you\u2019re allowed to have in total.Tagged enemies remain visible in the HUD even when they\u2019re not in sight. With the way most maps are laid out, it\u2019s best to tag them in groups and then take them out one by one before moving on to a new patrol area."

      "description":"Resources aren\u2019t exactly scarce in Sniper Elite 3, but you can only carry a limited amount at a time. The sniper rifle itself always comes with a generous amount of ammo, but you only get three clips worth of machine gun ammo and two clips worth of silenced pistol ammo. Bandages, medkits, and various explosives and traps also cap out at three apiece. Unless you\u2019re just sniping \u2014 which is very difficult to pull off \u2014 you\u2019re going to dip into these supplies before long. Keep an eye out as you explore for pickups on the ground and open crates filled with goodies. It\u2019s very easy to keep your supplies topped off if you\u2019re vigilant. Be sure to loot the corpse of any enemy you take out. Not only does this provide valuable resource recovery, but looting certain, specific enemies also rewards you with one of the 15 collectible Weapon Upgrades (includes binoculars)."

      "headline":"Go loud with confidence!",
      "description":"Sniper rifles make a lot of noise when they fire. Since there\u2019s no silenced option available in Sniper Elite 3 (with the exception of the Welrod pistol), you\u2019ve got to go loud whenever you want to take out enemies from a distance. Fortunately, there\u2019s a feature called \u201csound masking\u201d that allows you to use ambient noise in the environment to conceal the noise generated by your sniper fire. It\u2019s simply, really: whenever you see a mirrored set of pulsing lines (looks like three pairs of parentheses facing each other) at the top-center of the screen, you can fire any unsilenced weapon without giving your position away. Sometimes the sound-masking noises are generated by objects in the world, such as a backfiring truck or a manned anti-air emplacement. These can be effectively \u201cturned off\u201d by alerting or killing the troops connected to the source of the noise, so it\u2019s best to use the masked sound as much as you can to take out other enemies on the map before you kill the source of your sound-masking. You also sometimes come across power generators of varying sizes. Interact with one to kick it a few times, causing it to backfire at regular intervals. This masks your unsilenced shots as well as an anti-air turret would, though generators don\u2019t last forever. Try to do all of your spotting before you break the generator to better maximize your sound-masking time. Also note that in all cases, you\u2019ve got to be close to the source if you want to hide your shots. If you hear a zooming plane overhead or a truck backfiring, but don\u2019t see the sound-mask icon, then you\u2019re too far."

      "headline":"Fire with care.",
      "description":"There are three levels of difficulty relating to Sniper Elite 3\u2018s bullet physics, each one impacting a bullet\u2019s path of travel and how factors like wind resistance and drag influence its course. When you\u2019re just popping off shots unaided at the Limited or Realistic settings, it\u2019s important to consider how far you are from the target and how the weather might affect it. You can also press L1 (PlayStation controller) when you\u2019re peering through a scope to steady aim. Not only does this eliminate shake for a brief period of time, it also brings up a small diamond icon in your sights that shows where the bullet is going to land, based on where you\u2019re aiming. Note that you can\u2019t steady your aim if the heart rate (bottom of the screen) is higher than 80 BPM, so make sure to stop running and crouch down as you move into a firing position."

      "headline":"Fight on your own terms!",
      "description":"Sniper Elite 3 isn\u2019t a stealth game in the sense that there\u2019s no insta-fail for being spotted. That said, protagonist Karl Fairburne isn\u2019t exactly built to sponge up a shower of bullets like so many other shooter heroes. Couple that with the fact that there\u2019s limited ammo available for his non-sniper rifle weapons, and staying quiet becomes something of a necessity. For the most part. The trick with engaging the enemy in Sniper Elite 3 is to always take them down on your own terms. If you can do it quietly, all the better. That\u2019s not always an option, however. When you have to go loud, just make sure you\u2019ve scouted your surroundings thoroughly. Ask yourself if you\u2019re in a good, defensible position that offers a good view of the surrounding area. Set a few trip mines and S-mines (land mines too if there are vehicles rolling around) to cover your flank. Enemy forces eventually rush your position, but it\u2019s often possible to take them all out on the approach if you set yourself up in a good spot. Sometimes going loud brings an infinitely spawning supply of enemies, but even those situations aren\u2019t lost causes. Simply clear out anyone nearby and relocate to a new position, then lay low until the alert goes away. You may end up with a few new enemies on the map, but it\u2019s probably less than there were before (and therefore, easier to deal with quietly)."
