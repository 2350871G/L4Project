Make sure you wear gloves, eye protection and clothing with sleeves while cutting the metal wire. The edges of the wire spokes will be very sharp after you cut them, and it can be easy to slice yourself while molding the body of the cage if you\u2019re not careful. Take proper safety precautions when working around sharp metal edges. Place the wire roll on the ground and hold it far away from your face while cutting. Store extra concrete wire for patch-ups or other future projects."

This should be easy to do, as the wire comes in a roll and will want to curve in on itself naturally. Bend the spokes at the cut ends and hook them together to connect them. Your tomato cage will be approximately 2 feet (0.61 m) in diameter, making it spacious enough to accommodate most larger tomato plants. Give the hooked ends an extra twist to make sure they stay secured. Make sure any exposed cut spokes are snipped away or covered. You can use zip ties or another type of fastener to ensure that your cages will not separate over time."

Insert the spikes into the soil around the tomato plant about 5 inches (13 cm) deep. You\u2019re done! The open squares in the concrete wire will be small enough to contain overgrown foliage, but large enough to allow you to water and pick ripe tomatoes. These cages are tough, lightweight and easy to remove and store."

Livestock paneling is a kind of thick, heavy metal grating designed to be rugged enough to keep smaller animals from getting into or escaping confined areas. It usually comes in sections that are about 16 feet (4.9 m) long and 4 feet (1.2 m)  wide. Livestock paneling will be slightly more expensive than concrete wire or wood for making tomato cages. However, they will last considerably longer and will be in no danger of being uprooted or damaged by animals or the elements due to the paneling\u2019s tough construction."

You should be left with a rectangular section of paneling 6 squares wide and 9 squares high. Use gloves and eye protection when handling the bolt cutters.

Stand the cage pieces up lengthwise, spike-sides down, and push each section down forcefully into the soil around your tomato plants. The cage will protect and contain the growth of the plants, allowing the other sides to remain open for easy watering, mulching and picking. The cages will be slightly heavy, so the spikes should be inserted 5 inches (13 cm) to 6 inches (15 cm) into the ground to help it hold steady. If you\u2019re using cages to support multiple tomato plants, position them so that the cage corners are facing each other. This will keep the tomato plants from growing unchecked into one another."
