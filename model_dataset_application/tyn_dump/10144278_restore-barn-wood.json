Dip a cleaning brush in the solution and scrub the entire surface of the barn wood, applying extra pressure to dirty or stained areas.

Rub the 220-grit sandpaper in circular motions around the wood's surface, then brush away any residual sandpaper dust with a washcloth. For a faster alternative, use an electric sander instead.
