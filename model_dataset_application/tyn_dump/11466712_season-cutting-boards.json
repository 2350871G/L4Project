Soap up a sponge or dishcloth with gentle dish detergent and thoroughly rub the entire surface, edges and handle of the board until it is ultra clean. Rub away any obvious food particles, focusing especially on any crevices in the wood. Lastly, rinse away the soap with copious amounts of warm water and pat dry. Never put your wooden cutting board in the dishwasher, as this can cause the wood to warp and crack. Instead, set your cutting board aside to wash by hand."

Spray the surfaces moderately, ensuring that all surfaces are wetted. Wait 3-5 minutes for the vinegar to perform its actions, then rinse off the board with cool running water. For the commercial sanitizer, follow the directions on the bottle. You might need to do this fairly often if you have an older, more worn out cutting board. Commercial sanitizers can be purchased at supermarkets, large retailers, or at home improvement stores."
