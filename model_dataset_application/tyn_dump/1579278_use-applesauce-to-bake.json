      "description":"Making the applesauce will allow you to control the amount of sugar and preservatives, resulting in even healthier baking. To make your applesauce, wash, core, and quarter 2 lb. (908 g) of apples. Put them in a large pot filled with water that is at least an inch (2.5 cm) deeper than the apples. Boil until the apples are soft. With a bit of cooking water or unsweetened apple juice, put them through a blender or food mill. Add 1 tsp. (2 g) of spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. For baking purposes, use unsweetened applesauce. Add up to 1/2 cup (96 g) of sugar or 1/3 cup (113 g) of honey to homemade applesauce, if you plan to eat it on its own. Reduce the amount of sugar you use in a recipe if you are using sweetened applesauce."

Taste the result and move toward replacing more oil with applesauce next time if it compliments the recipe. You do not need to substitute all of the oil to get a healthy effect.
