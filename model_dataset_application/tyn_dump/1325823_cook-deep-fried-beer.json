This helps to give the dough color and makes it shiny when it is cooked. Making the Pockets of Beer Use a ravioli cutter to slice the dough into 12 pieces. Run the blade of the ravioli cutter along the dough. Divide the dough using the ravioli cutter into small rectangles. A ravioli cutter is used to give the dough a distinct wavy edge. Press the rectangles of dough together to create 6 ravioli pockets. Pair up each of the ravioli pieces. Gently press along the 2 short edges and 1 long edge to create a pocket. Leave the last long edge open as this will be where you pour the beer in. Make sure that the sides of the dough with the egg wash are facing the outside. You may need to hold each ravioli pocket open using your thumb while you press the edges together, to prevent the dough from sticking. Fill each ravioli pocket up 3/4 of the way with beer.

Gently seal the open edge of each ravioli pocket. Try not to press too firmly as otherwise, the dough could break and the beer would spill out. Deep-Frying the Beer Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan until it reaches 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C). Pour 2 cups (470 ml) of vegetable oil into a deep pan and adjust the stovetop temperature to a high setting. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the oil as it heats. Deep-fry the ravioli pockets in the oil for 20 seconds each. Once the oil has reached the desired temperature, use a slotted spoon to carefully place 1 pocket into the pan. Set the timer for 20 seconds and use a slotted spoon to remove the pocket once the time is up. You may be able to fit more than 1 ravioli pocket in the pan at a time.
