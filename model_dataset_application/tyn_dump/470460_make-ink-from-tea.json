          "description":"For this process, you are going to need black tea, water, and a thickening agent (either gum arabic or cornstarch). Some recipes also call for vinegar, which can make your ink a bit more uniform in color. You will also need a few measuring spoons, a metal or wooden spoon, a strainer (if using loose tea), and a ceramic bowl. Finally, if you intend to bottle your ink, you\u2019ll need a small glass bottle with a screw-top lid. Gum Arabic can be found at most craft stores. Everything else may be found at a grocery store.

Claire Donovan-Blackwood\t\t\tCrafting Expert, Heart Handmade UK\t\t\t\tUse teas that have a dark color and bitter taste.
