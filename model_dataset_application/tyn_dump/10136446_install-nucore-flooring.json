          "description":"Grab the carpet by an edge against the wall and peel it back as much as possible. Afterwards, use a utility or carpet knife to slice it into manageable strips. Continue pulling the carpet back, cutting it up into smaller strips and rolling it up. Remove any carpet padding in the same manner and cut it up into strips that can easily be transported. Although NuCore can't be installed over carpet, it can be installed over even concrete, wood, vinyl, linoleum, and ceramic tile floors. Remove any remaining carpet tack strips and staples from the carpet pad when you're done. Slide a pry bar under the nails that secure the strips and lift them up. For staples, pull them up with pliers and use a flat-bladed screwdriver to pull them out."

Store them at room temperature for at least 12 hours. Don't remove your boards from their packaging during acclimation. Maintain your installation room's temperature between a steady 60 to 80 \u00b0F (16 to 27 \u00b0C) both before and during installation."

          "description":"Although NuCore is waterproof, the subfloor must still be moisture-free for a proper installation. Sweep the floor with a broom to gather any dust or dirt particles. For wet areas, use a dry mop to collect water and moisture. Use a digital contact moisture meter to check the floor's moisture. Tap the device's 2 points to the floor and ensure that the moisture level is not about 2.5%. Check that your subfloor is level to \u204416 inch (0.48 cm) within a span of 10 feet (3.0 m).

For example, if your floor is 55 inches (140 cm) and your planks are 6 inches (15 cm), you are left with 9.16, meaning 9 full planks will fit and leave just 1 inch (2.5 cm) of width remaining. This means you need to cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the width of each first row plank to accommodate it. On average, planks are between 6 to 7 inches (15 to 18 cm) wide and 48 inches (120 cm) long."

Afterwards, cut along the same line, this time applying pressure so that you cut deep enough to pull the plank apart. After cutting your plank, you should be able to fold it in half and pull off the extra piece. Cut down each plank in the first row in this manner. For example, if you need to cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your 6 inch (15 cm) first row planks, they should all be 5 inches (13 cm) in width after cutting."

You can also use a miter saw and 80-tooth finish saw blade to cut your planks to size. Completing the Installation Start the second row with the leftover plank from the first row. This plank acts as the first piece of your second row. The small plank should be at least 12 inches (30 cm) long. If the leftover piece is too short, cut a new plank into 2 pieces to create a piece that's an appropriate size. Always make sure that your planks are at least 12 inches (30 cm) long. The end joints (vertical crack between each attached plank) of every row should be 8 inches (20 cm) or more horizontally apart from adjoining rows. Attach the long side of second row planks into the first row. Make sure that they are tight into the short end of each previous plank at an angle of 30 degrees. Drop each plank down from this angle and gently tap the tows together with your mallet to eliminate any gaps between long sides. Always make sure your planks are perfectly aligned. If they're not, disassemble them and check for dirt or particles lodged in the locking regions. Tap scrap planks gently into previous rows using a vertical hammering motion. After placing your rows down, place a scrap plank against the bottom side of the row and use a mallet to hammer them upward using a vertical motion. This procedure helps you ensure that each row is tightly attached and there are no gaps between any of the planks. Be sure to do this after each row is complete\u2014gaps can compromise the entire installation. Place \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) spacers on the front wall after 2 to 3 rows. You should now have \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) spacers between your planks and the left, right, and front walls. These gaps are important to give yourself enough space to properly install molding following installation. Use this time to make sure that all of your end joints are at least 8 inches (20 cm) apart. Position a loose plank on top of the previous row when laying the final row. Afterwards, place another board on top, making sure that the tongue side faces the wall. If you're unsure which is the tongue side, look for the side that has a piece extending outward from the middle of the board that fits into the groove of the next piece. Draw a line along the edge of the loose plank on top of the previous row. Afterwards, cut along the line to mark the first plank. Then, go over the line again with your knife, this time cutting deep enough that you can pull the bottom off. The plank should now be the proper size for the final row. Continue cutting boards in this manner to create planks for the final row. Place your pre-cut planks into the final row. Always make sure they are at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide. If you measured your room properly, this shouldn't be a problem. If you find that your planks must be less than 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide, cut down the planks in your first row to accommodate them. Remove the spacers before you place each plank into the final row.",
