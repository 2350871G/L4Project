  "text":" Scaling the Snapper Put the fish on a counter with its head facing your non-dominant hand. You\u2019re going to use your dominant hand to scale the fish, and you need to hold it by its head with your other hand. Hold the fish by the head and scrape it with a knife or scaling tool. Move against the grain of the scales to remove them. Start at the tail and work your way toward the head. Scale both sides of the fish\u2019s body, including its belly.You can also use a butter knife to scale a fish. Consider wearing gloves when handling fish to reduce the risk of being cut by scales. Avoid moving the knife too hard, or you might cut the fish. Rinse the fish under the faucet to remove loose scales. You don\u2019t need heavy water pressure for this. Use just enough pressure to remove the loose scales without damaging the delicate fish meat. Lay the snapper on a cutting board and examine its skin for leftover scales. Move the palm of your hand back and forth along the sides to feel stubble, which feels slightly prickly but not sharp. Stubble indicates that the scales are gone, so you should feel it after removing the scales. The fish will also look smoother. Gutting a Snapper Make an incision from the fish\u2019s anus to its jaw. Insert a sharp fillet knife into the fish\u2019s anus and bring it all the way to the base of the lower jaw. Be mindful not to push the knife in too deep, or you\u2019ll puncture the intestines, which will emit a rancid odor. Make the incision deep enough for you to stick your fingers inside to pull the meat back. Make sure your knife is sharp enough to easily cut through the fish without much force. The knife\u2019s handle should be dry when handling it to prevent your hands from slipping. Pull the entrails out of the incision with your hands and a spoon. Open up the new cavity and pull its organs out. Use a knife to detach the gill filaments from the base of the head. Scrape out the kidneys, liver, and remaining organs with a spoon. Dispose of entrails by packing them in a double zip-lock bag. This prevents the smell from escaping in your trash, and you also won\u2019t attract wildlife to your area.
