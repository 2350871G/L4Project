They can be planted in spots that get full sun, partial sun, or light shade. Make sure that they will get morning sun and afternoon shade if possible. Generally, geraniums are happiest with five or six hours of sunlight a day, though this number can be a bit more or a bit less. It is best to plant geraniums in soil that drains well. Geraniums don\u2019t really like getting their feet too wet and soggy soil could lead to a sick plant. If you live in an area that is really hot a lot of the year, try to find a spot that gets afternoon shade and has relatively moist soil."

          "description":"Geraniums do not like sitting in soggy soil, so it is important to get a pot with good drainage. Buy a pot that is large enough for your plant, depending on the variety of geranium you bought. If you have a smaller plant, you may be fine with a 6 or 8 inch (15.2 or 20.3 cm) pot, while larger varieties will need a 10 inch (25.4 cm) pot. Avoid placing a saucer under your plant\u2019s pot unless the saucer has pebbles in it."

For example, if you bought a geranium that came in a 6-inch plastic pot, you should make a hole that is 1 foot (0.3 m) in diameter. If you choose to grow your geraniums from seeds, sow them directly into the ground. If you do choose to use seeds, know that your plants will take longer to grow and blossom. If you are sowing seeds in a pot, start your pot off indoors while the seeds take root. Once the seeds begin to sprout, you can move the pot outside. If you need to move the plants outside during harsher weather, then start by leaving them outside during the day when it is warmer and bringing them in at night.

Place the plant in the hole so that the plant\u2019s root ball (the bundle of roots that have been squished together in the plastic container) is level with the surface of the soil. However, if your soil has a lot of clay in it, then you may want to plant it up higher since clay will make a basin for water and this will cause your geraniums to rot. Fill the rest of the hole up with soil and pat the soil down around the plant so that the geranium can stand up on its own. Water your plant immediately, but be careful not to rinse the soil away from the root ball. Water gently at the base of the plant. Try to avoid putting soil on the stem of the plant, as a buried stem could lead to a rotting plant."
