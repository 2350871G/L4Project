          "description":"Take your empty roll of paper towel and hold it in your hand by its end, or give it to the person who will be using the pretend lightsaber. Your fingers should curl around the side of the tube and your thumb should lie along the topside of it. The total length of your hilt should be about the same as the distance between your wrist and elbow. Younger children with smaller hands might find that smaller rolls of cardboard, like a toilet paper roll, fit their hand better. You could trim your paper towel roll to an appropriate size with your scissors. If you make your lightsaber too small, you run the risk of it being missed by the people who see your costume. This can leave them confused as to what your costume is. A clearly visible lightsaber hilt at your side will mark you as a trained Jedi."

          "headline":"Cover the tube with gray duct tape.",
          "description":"The main color of most lightsaber handles is gray, so you should use gray duct tape to cover your cardboard tube completely. This will make your lightsaber appear like it's made of metal. When your tube is covered from top to bottom, use your scissors to cut the tape free of the roll and smooth the loose end to your hilt. Wind your tape around the tube smoothly and evenly. Air bubbles or bunched up tape will make your lightsaber look less realistic. You can prevent these by smoothing the tape with one hand while winding it around your tube with the other."

          "headline":"Prepare your accent strips.",
          "description":"In the Star Wars movies, TV shows, and comics, there are many small accents on lightsabers. These give your lightsaber a more complex appearance. The colors used for lightsaber accents are most typically blacks, grays, and golds. Tear or cut off two 5\u201310 inch (12.7\u201325.4 cm) pieces of the black duct tape. These black pieces will be used to give your hilt a hand grip. Stick the tape to the edge of a table so you can get it easily when you need it."

Then roll this strip of duct tape tightly so that the sticky side is facing out. Your rolled duct tape should be small enough to hide under your Lego piece. Stick the rolled, outside-sticky piece of tape to the bottom of your Lego piece. It will eventually become your on button. For now, you can stick it out of the way with your accent strips. Since the classic lightsaber design uses many metallic and base colors, like black, gold, and gray, you should consider using a colorful Lego block to give your lightsaber some character. Blue and red are popular choices."

You can do this in whatever way you find most appropriate - as a Jedi you should have a natural intuition for the placement of your lightsaber hand grip. Wind your accent strips completely around the hilt until they are smoothly attached. You might overlap both strips to create one large grip, or you might break up the strips so there's a small space between. You could even spread out the bottom part of the grip so it's wider than the top. If you don't have black duct tape, you can substitute black electrical tape. If electrical tape is unavailable, you can color clear scotch tape black with your marker and use that instead."

The Lego on/off switch for your lightsaber is only there to make it look more realistic. Pressing it will not have an effect on your lightsaber. If you have split your hand grip so there is a small space between the upper and lower part of your grip, you might want to put your on/off switch there.

Cut a strip of duct tape with you scissors wide enough to cover the hole, then cover the hole with the tape. Then you should tuck the sides of the tape to lie as flat as possible against the sides of your lightsaber. Because the bottom of your lightsaber is round, your tape might bunch when tucking the sides down. You can cover this up with another piece of gray duct tape around the cylindrical part of the bottom. This extra piece of gray tape will also help hold your bottom cover in place. You might want to use two strips of duct tape to close off the open end. This way you can use one piece to cover half of the hole and the other piece to close it off completely.

Then:\nHold a binder clip flat to the side of your lightsaber toward the bottom of the hilt. Position the binder clip so it's open side is facing the top of the lightsaber. Orient the silver \"wings\" of your binder clip to bend away from its mouth. The inside wing should run mostly flat along the side of your lightsaber.

Evil Jedi called the Sith prefer to use red lightsabers and red accents on their weapons. This is because Sith masters have an aggressive view of the force, which is represented by red.
