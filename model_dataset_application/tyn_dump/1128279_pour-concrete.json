The soil underneath your subbase is called your subgrade, and your concrete is only going to be as strong as your subgrade. Think about it: If your subgrade shifts, craters, or otherwise moves, the integrity of your concrete is going to be compromised. Make sure your subgrade is properly compacted and stabilized before adding the subbase."

          "description":"A form is usually a wooden perimeter, secured by special nails or screws, and built around the pouring site. A well-built form will help you achieve a better finish on your concrete. Keep a couple things in mind when building your form:\nFor square or rectangular forms, make sure that your corners form 90 degree angles. Take a tape measure and measure both diagonals of the square or rectangular; they should correspond to one another exactly. If they don't, it's back to the drawing board with your form. Also make sure that the forms have a slight slope to them. If they are completely level, you can expect water build up in the middle of your beautiful concrete. To eliminate this possibility, create a slight slope of 1\" for every 10 feet."

Wire mesh will help guard small cracks growing and spreading, as well as offer stability across two axes (wire mesh is welded, where rebar is often tied together). Rebar may offer better structural integrity, and be better for higher load-bearing surfaces. On the flip side, it doesn't do much to minimize the appearance of cracks that do appear."

Do this by moving the bull float away from you, keeping the tailing edge slightly elevated, and then moving the bull float back towards you, keeping the leading edge slightly elevated.
