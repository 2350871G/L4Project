          "description":"For best results, choose a variety of fleshy summer fruit and use it while the fruit is in its ripest stage. Use a blend of multiple fruits instead of using only one type. Note that you do not need to add all of the fruit at the same time. You can gradually add different types to the mixture as the season progresses. Strawberries, raspberries, cherries, peaches, apricots, pineapple, nectarines, red currents, pears, seedless grapes, and plums are all popular choices. Avoid berries that are heavily seeded, like blackberries, and fruit that is too soft, like bananas. Acidic citrus fruits and watery fruits (cantaloupe, watermelon, etc.) are also poor choices. You may also want to avoid dark fruits, like blueberries, since they can discolor some of the lighter fruits in the mixture."

Large fruits will need to be cut into bite-size pieces or smaller. Medium fruits, like strawberries, may need to be cut into halves or quarters. It's also a good idea to measure the volume of fruit you have after you cut it. Measurements don't need to be exact, but you should have a fairly accurate estimate of the amount of fruit being used."

Continue adding more fruit every few weeks until the end of summer or until the pot is full. When you add more fruit, you must also add more sugar. Make sure there is enough brandy to keep the fruit submerged, as well. Keep a lid on the pot of fruit as it sits out. If you don't have a lid, use a tight sheet of aluminum foil or plastic wrap. The pot of fruit should sit in a cool place and out of direct sunlight. Stir the fruit every few days to make sure that it stays submerged. Stirring also helps to dissolve the sugar."
