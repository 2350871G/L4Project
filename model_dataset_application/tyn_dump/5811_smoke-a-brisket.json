Use the \"indirect heat\" method of cooking on a grill by either pushing all the coals to one side and cooking on the other, or only lighting one side of a gas grill. Place hardwood chips that have been soaking in water for at least 1 hour over the fire. These produce the smoke that flavors the meat and the moisture that keeps it from drying out.
