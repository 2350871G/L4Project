Salt raises the boiling temperature of the water, helping the chard to cook faster when you put it in. Placing a lid over your pot will help it boil faster."

This basket will be fitting on top of your pot of boiling water. If you separated the leaves and stems of your chard because the stems were thick, only insert the stems for now. If this is the case, you'll lift the lid and insert the leaves after 1-2 minutes of the stems steaming."
