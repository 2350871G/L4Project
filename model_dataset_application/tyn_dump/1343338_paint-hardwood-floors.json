          "description":"You\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time kneeling on the floor, so get some kneepads to prevent damaging your knees. The process of stripping finish and paint off of wood requires a lot of sanding, so wear a dust mask or respirator to prevent the inhalation of wood dust or debris. Wear some heavy gloves so that you don\u2019t get splinters all over your hands. Cover outlets or openings with duct tape or electrical tape to keep dust and wood shavings from flying into sensitive areas. You can use a thick pillow instead of kneepads if you want."

          "headline":"Sand your floor lightly with 100-grit sandpaper.",
          "description":"Starting at the furthest corner from the door, put a sheet of 100-grit sandpaper down on the floor. Put your hand on top of the sheet and press down before rubbing in a circular motion. Cover a section 5-6 times before moving your sandpaper to another section of the floor. Continue until you\u2019ve sanded the entire floor. Even if your wood doesn\u2019t have a varnish or enamel on it, you still need to sand it at least once to soften the wood for painting. The paint won\u2019t dry into the porous wood if it hasn\u2019t been lightly sanded. You should see the wood get visibly lighter after sanding if the wood was covered in a varnish or stain."

          "description":"Rent an orbital or belt sander at your local hardware store and attach a sheet of 100-grit sandpaper to strip any larger surface areas. Start in the corner of a room furthest from the door and turn your sander to the lowest power setting. Run the sander across your room horizontally, working towards the door until you\u2019ve covered the entire surface. You have to buy special sheets of sandpaper to fit a belt or orbital sander. Even if you plan on using an orbital or belt sander, you\u2019ll need to sand the edges near the corners and side of the wall by hand. If you still see a layer of finish or varnish after your first sanding, sand the entire floor a second time with 220-grit sandpaper."

Afterward, use a standard vacuum to pull up any remaining wood shavings or chunks of varnish.Tip: You can use a damp towel to soak up any hard-to-see wood shavings or dust for an added layer of cleaning. Use a dry tack cloth if you\u2019re nervous about raising the wood grain or getting it wet but still want a third cleaning option."

If you plan on painting your floor a deeper red or blue, use a gray, oil-based primer. The primer will help adhere the paint to the wood and will make sure that it stands up over time.Warning: Oil-based primers are almost always toxic.

Tilt the can over a paint tray and fill it to the first hash mark with primer. If your paint didn\u2019t come with a mixing stick, you can use any thin object to mix it.

    "Use a natural-bristle angle brush to cut around baseboards and walls.",
    "A roller will not reach the trim in sections of a room near a wall or baseboard.",
    "For these hard-to-reach edges, use a natural-bristle angle brush to cut around the trim by dipping the tip of your brush in the enamel and running it carefully along the 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) next to a wall.",
    "Cover every part of a room\u2019s trim before you continue.",
    "Roll the room with a roller if you want to give it a stippled finish.",
    "You can use a thin-napped roller to fill in the remainder of the room for a stippled finish.",
    "The more porous sections of wood will absorb paint from the roller at a greater rate than the firmer sections, which will leave your floor with a unique texture when you\u2019re done.",
    "To roll the rest of the room, cover your roller in enamel and work from the corner furthest from the door to roll each section of the floor.",
    "You can use a thick-napped roller instead if you want even more variety in your texture.",
    "Paint the rest of the room with a brush if you want a smoother look.",
    "If you want a more uniform finish, use a larger natural-bristle brush to paint the rest of your floor.",
    "Start with the section of your floor furthest from the door and paint in back-and-forth strokes.",
    "Work in the direction of your floorboards as you cover each section of the floor.",
    "Cover each part of your floor with 3-4 strokes before moving on to a different section to ensure that it\u2019s fully covered.",
    "Let your room air dry for at least 24 hours.",
    "After you\u2019ve applied your first coat of paint, let it air dry for a full day before walking on it to apply additional coats.",
    "Avoid walking on it with thick boots or high heels even after it has dried for 24 hours to prevent damaging the first layer of paint.",
    "Apply 2-3 additional coats to deepen the color of your floor as desired.",
    "The more layers of paint that you add, the deeper and richer the color will be.",
    "Wait at least 24 hours after every painting session to ensure that the previous coat has time to dry.",
    "Wait 1 month after applying your last coat before adding any heavy furniture to the room to give it adequate time to breathe.",
    "You may not want to apply any additional layers if you\u2019re going for a more worn-down or textured look.",
    "The more layers you add, the more uniform your paint job will be."
