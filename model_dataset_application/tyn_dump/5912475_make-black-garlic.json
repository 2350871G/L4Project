Although you can use standard garlic, it may be easier to use the black garlic if it's a single clove. Some grocery stores may call solo garlic \"pearl garlic.\" Discard garlic that's cracked or has already started to sprout from the top because these will be bitter."

Keep in mind that making black garlic in the rice cooker will permanently make the cooker smell like garlic. Some rice cookers have an Extended Keep Warm function.

Then grind them in a food processor until you have a fine powder.Tip: Since the seasoning is quickly absorbed by liquid, it's great in sauces, soup, and curry.
