This way, your finished rod will extend 3 to 6 inches (7.62 to 15.24 centimeters) past the window/doorway on both sides. If you want the curtain to be inside the window/doorway, then measure inside the frame, along the top edge. Do not add any extra measurements."

Do not use a tension rod; it won't be sturdy enough. You can cut the wood yourself using a saw, or you can ask the hardware store to do it for you. If you already have a sturdy metal rod, you can use that instead."

If you drill the holes into sheetrock, the weight of the curtains will pull the rod right off the wall. Depending on how wide your window or doorway is, you will need between 2 and 3 hooks. The wider the window/doorway is, the more hooks you will need. If you are going to mount the curtain inside your window/doorway, then drill the holes into the frame itself. You will need to get a special type of mounts intended for hanging curtains inside windows."

If you are resting the curtain inside the window/doorway, be prepared for a tight fit. You may have to sand down the end of the curtain rod."

Cut your fishing line accordingly. You are cutting your fishing line twice as long because you will be folding it in half and inserting two strands inside each bead. The extra 12 inches (30.46 centimeters) will allow you to finish off the curtains. Cut and work on one strand at a time. If you cut too many strands at once, the fishing line may turn into a tangled mess. If you don't have any fishing line, you can also try using strong, sturdy thread, colored string, or even wire. Whatever you decide to use, make sure that it is thin enough to go through your beads."

Work on one ring at a time. Hang each ring onto the rod as soon as you finish it. Split rings are the same thing as keychain rings.
