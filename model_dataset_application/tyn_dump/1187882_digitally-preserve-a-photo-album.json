      "description":"Do you know all of the people in the photos? Do you know where or when the photos were taken? Is this information clearly shown in the album? Sit down with your relatives and have an \"album party\" where you go through each photo and record who is who and any other information they know. You will learn more about your family than you ever knew before. You'll want to record those family stories as well. Record the entire session using a tape recorder if you have one. I recommend using small post-it notes to record information about each photo. You can then place the note near the photo in the album. DO NOT write on the actual photos to record the information, it will damage them permanently. And be sure that the stickiness of the post-it note will not damage the photos as well. If you don't have post-it notes or don't want to chance damage to the photos, then record the information on index cards or a legal pad, carefully recording the information for each photo from each page. Make sure you record it in such a way that it will make sense to you later after all of your relatives have gone home."

Once it comes apart, can you put it back together again? Are you going to replace the old photo album with a new one? All of these are important factors in how you handle the processing of the album. If the photos cannot be removed, then you will probably be scanning the photo from the album page itself. If the photos can be removed and replaced, you will probably be scanning them off of the page directly."

      "description":"Accept it now and move on with the scanning. Yes, you want to get the best quality scans from your efforts, but there will always be some degradation from the original. The scans will never be as crisp or exactly the same colors. There are ways to deal with that later. But just having a decent digital version of the photo, especially older photos, is a big step in the right direction, so don't let desired perfection get in the way of your actual work."
    },
    {
      "headline":"Scan the photos in batches.",
      "description":"Scanning each photo individually would be ideal, but it will take much longer. Put as many photos as you can reasonably fit into each scan and call this a \"raw\" scan. You can go back later and pull out each photo individually."

      "description":"You could just use consecutive numbers for each scan, like \"000-raw\", \"001-raw\", \"002-raw\", etc. Or you could use a description for each page, like \"page-01-raw\", \"page-02-raw\", \"page-03-raw\", etc. Think ahead about this. If you cannot remove the photos from the album pages and the pages are 10\" x 12\", chances are that you will need to do more than just one scan per page to get all of the photos on the page. How will you name your files then? \"page01-1-raw\", \"page01-2-raw\", etc?"

      "headline":"Store the scanned images in a \"lossless\" format.",
      "description":"If you are using Photoshop store them in Photoshop format (.psd). Otherwise, store them in TIFF (.tif) format with the \"no image compression\" option. DO NOT store your original scans in JPEG format (.jpg or .jpeg). JPEG is a \"lossy\" format which means that image information will be thrown away in order to compress the image to a smaller file size. You may not see a big difference when you look at the scanned images immediately, but later when you start to process and modify the images, more and more image information will be lost. So, start with a format that does not remove any image information to start with. Any modern image processing software should at least support TIFF format. The file sizes will be larger, but it will be worth it for long term storage."

You may not want this as it may cause the image to be blurry or cause portions to be cropped out. In order to avoid this, use your image software to change the dimensions of your image canvas to 4\" x 6\" or 5\" x 7\" (whichever is appropriate for the image) without resizing the existing image. Have the original image centered in the new canvas size. Now when you send the image for photo processing, the image will be the same as the original and it will be surrounded by white space.

Storing in multiple formats ensures that you have formats you need and formats that will probably be supported in the future. I recommend the following formats: JPEG, TIFF, and Photoshop. Scanned images should not be stored in JPEG, but processed images, when completed, should have a version stored in JPEG format. Most photo processors will only work with JPEG format when you want to print the images, so you will need to have JPEG versions. Just don't use the JPEG version for further image modification, instead use the TIFF or Photoshop versions. TIFF and Photoshop (if using Photoshop) versions are stored to maintain the lossless versions of the image and to allow for different formats to be available. Not all image software can read Photoshop format, but most can read TIFF format. Having them ensures future compatibility."

If you are doing this, then be sure to invest in some modern acid-free photo album pages and supplies.  Don't just transfer them into some cheap photo album you picked up at the local drugstore.  Photo album technology has come a long way in recent years, and the physical photos will be better preserved for the future.
