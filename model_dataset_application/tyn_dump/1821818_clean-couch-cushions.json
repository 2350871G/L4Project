    "Get the right equipment for steam cleaning.",
    "A steam upholstery cleaner is specifically intended to deep-clean the fabric of your furniture and is available to rent at most local hardware stores.",
    "If you use a steam cleaner, allow your furniture extra time to dry, as the cushions take on a considerable amount of moisture through this process.",
    "Always vacuum your couch to remove loose dirt and debris before using a steam cleaner.",
    "Vacuum the couch again after the cushions and upholstery have completely dried.",
    "Try the old-fashioned approach with a carpet beater.",
    "Using your carpet beater, firmly whack all your cushions on both the front and back.",
    "If you lack this tool, you can also use a clean broom, but you'll first need to take your couch cushions outside and place them on a clean surface.",
    "To prevent stains from grass or outside dirt, you may want to lay down a towel or drop cloth before setting your cushions outside.",
    "This process can sometimes kick up considerable dust, so you may want to consider wearing a dust mask while doing this.",
    "Check your cushions for color fastness.",
    "Apply a wet paste of water and detergent to the cushion and allow it to stand for a few minutes and then rinse it clean.",
    "If you notice discoloration after rinsing, you should not hand or machine wash. Take the cover to the dry cleaner instead.",
    "Create a dish detergent solution for cloth covers.",
    "Add equal parts mild dish detergent to cool water and agitate the solution until the soap and water mix completely to a whipped consistency.",
    "Now you can dip your sponge into the solution, wring out the excess moisture, and begin sponge-cleaning the cushion.",
    "Use proper sponging technique.",
    "For most fabrics, long strokes will serve you best.",
    "Sponge the cushion from one end to the other, working against the nap to bring up stains and remove any deeply buried dirt.",
    "After your first round of sponging, you should repeat the process, only this time applying your sponge with the nap.",
    "Cleanse the cushion of all remaining cleaner.",
    "Clean your sponge of any detergent it may have and moisten it with clean water.",
    "Repeat the sponging process, cleaning once with and once against the nap to remove all detergent and optimally clean the fabric of your cushion.",
    "Speed the drying process with a fan.",
    "Though shock-heating treatment can cause your fabric to shrink, using a normal fan to blow dry air over your cushion will help speed the drying process.",
    "Sponge cleaning can leave your fabric considerably wet; you should allow the cushion plenty of time to dry all the way through.",
    "You can also speed up the drying process by blotting the cushions with a dry towel after you remove any remaining detergent.",
    "Using a Dry Cleaning Solvent Purchase your dry cleaning solvent.",
    "This can be a little confusing, as \"dry\" cleaning solvent is generally sold in liquid state.",
    "The reason these solutions are so called is because these solvents are made without water.",
    "You can find these products in the home supply or cleaning section of most stores.",
    "If you cannot find something suitable in your area, an online retailer might be the way to go.",
    "Open windows and doors.",
    "Dry cleaning solutions can have a very strong odor and can be harmful to your health if breathed in for extended periods.",
    "A ceiling or box fan blowing fumes out an open window can help dissipate this smell.",
    "Prepare your cleaning rag.",
    "Putting your cleaner directly onto your cushion cover can do damage to the fabric, as these solutions are typically highly concentrated.",
    "To prevent this from happening, apply a small amount of cleaner to a clean rag, and follow any other instructions as directed.",
    "Spot-test to prevent unsightly damage.",
    "With your cleaner already applied to your rag, rub the rag on a part of the couch that is out of sight.",
    "Allow the spot to dry for about 10 minutes.",
    "After that, take a clean piece of paper towel and press it into the fabric where you applied the cleaning solution.",
    "If the paper towel picks up dye or the fabric becomes discolored, the solution you bought may be too strong.",
    "Press clean your cushion.",
    "Rubbing your rag with the solution on it against the fabric of your cushion can be too abrasive in combination with a harsh cleaning agent.",
    "Although this may take a considerable amount of time, you should press the rag and solution into the dirty/stained portions of your cushion to clean it.",
    "Do not apply too much solution to your fabric or you may cause discoloration or harm.",
    "Taking frequent breaks and allowing the cushion time to dry between applications can help prevent over-saturation.",
    "Remove the residual dry cleaner solution.",
    "Even trace amounts of dry cleaner solutions can have a negative effect if allowed to remain in the fabric of your cushions.",
    "After you have finished applying the solvent and allowed the cleaner to set for the amount of time indicated in the instructions, moisten a clean cloth and blot the areas you have cleaned.",
    "Be sure the cloth you use for blotting is only lightly damp, and rinse and wring it out regularly."
