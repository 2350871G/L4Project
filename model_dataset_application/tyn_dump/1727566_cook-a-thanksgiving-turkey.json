          "description":"Frozen turkeys must be kept frozen until you're ready to use them. A few days before cooking your meal, you can start thawing out the turkey using a poultry-safe method that will prevent the growth and spread of bacteria. You cannot safely thaw turkey at room temperature for more than 2 hours. To thaw the turkey in the refrigerator, you will need about 24 hours per 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of turkey. Simply place the turkey in the refrigerator a few days before you plan to cook it. Once thawed, the turkey can stay in the fridge for another 2 days. Make sure you place a protective sheet or plate under the bird to catch any liquid. If you don\u2019t have as much time, you can also thaw the turkey in cold water, and this will only require about 30 minutes per 1 pound (0.45 kg). Place the turkey in a sealable plastic bag and submerge it in cold water. Change the water every 30 minutes. Cook the thawed turkey immediately."

Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Remove the mixture from the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature. Transfer it to a food storage container and put it in the refrigerator. To give the brine the best flavor, prepare it 3 days before you plan to cook the turkey. Then store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to brine the turkey the night before cooking. This amount of brine is suitable for a turkey up to 16 pounds (7.3 kg)."

The night before you plan to cook the turkey, remove the neck and giblets from the turkey cavity and place the turkey breast-down in a large stockpot. Add the ice water and brine solution to cover the turkey. If the turkey is floating and not submerged in the brine solution, weigh it down with a plate. Cover the pot with foil or a lid. Place the pot in the refrigerator for anywhere from 12 to 24 hours. Turn the turkey halfway through the brining process."

Warning: Only rinse raw turkey if you need to remove excess brine. Rinsing the turkey can spread germs around your kitchen work area. Put down paper towels to protect the area around your sink, and wash your sink and counter with hot, soapy water both before and after rinsing. After patting the turkey dry, let it air dry for another hour before cooking it to ensure the crispiest skin possible. Always make sure you wash your hands, cooking surfaces, and dishes well with hot, soapy water when dealing with raw poultry."

To find the giblets, you must first locate the head of the turkey. Look at the orientation of the legs, because they will always point toward the back of the turkey, meaning the head is opposite. At the head of the turkey, there will be a flap of skin that covers the neck cavity, and the giblets will be located in here. Pull up the flap, place your hand in the cavity, and pull out the giblets. You may also have to remove the neck, which will likely be located in the cavity between the legs at the back of the turkey.
