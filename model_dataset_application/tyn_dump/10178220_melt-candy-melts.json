If your package contains more than that, measure out 12 to 16 ounces (340 to 452 g) of wafers into a bowl and save the rest for later. Alternatively, empty the candy melts into a heavy-duty, plastic, resealable bag, then zip it tightly. For a smaller batch, fill a plastic piping bottle halfway with candy melts instead.
