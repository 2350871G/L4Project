Later in the game, they will begin using mortars. They normally use it when you're in a vehicle. They are very accurate and if you don't pay attention, you'll be blown to bits. Only way you'll know if one's coming is by the whistle it gives off. If you hear it, turn as fast as you can and head in another direction."
