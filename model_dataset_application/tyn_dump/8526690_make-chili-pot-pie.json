Drain the excess fat and water, then add kidney and pinto beans, chopped white onion, green pepper, garlic and tomato sauce. Stir the ingredients together and season to taste. Include a 6 ounce can of tomato paste if you prefer thicker chili. Add some heat to your chili with half a cup of diced jalape\u00f1o, poblano or ancho chile peppers."

This will save you time and money, helping you get dinner served faster and simplifying the cooking and cleaning processes. 2-3 cans should be enough for a standard pot pie. Enhance the flavor of storebought chili with an extra dash of chili powder, cayenne or garlic. Look for hearty stew-style chilis. Stay away from the thin, watery types of chili used for hot dogs."

Stir every few minutes to keep the temperature consistent throughout. The longer you simmer the chili, the more time the individual flavors will have to set up and mingle with one another. The chili should already be hot when it goes into the oven."

Make sure the dish you use is oven safe and large enough to hold the prescribed amounts of both chili and cornbread batter. Another idea is to use a small single-serving dish, such as a miniature baking mug or muffin tin, to make fun individual portions. Just make sure to leave about an inch of space at the top of the dish. Baking the cornbread topping with the chili underneath will keep it moist and help it cook faster."
