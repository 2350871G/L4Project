You'll also need 6 skeins of bulky yarn, scissors and a knitting tool or crochet hook. Each skein should weigh 6 ounces (170 g) or measure 169 meters (185 yards)."

For example, you may have 3 inches (7.5 cm) of an anchor tail at both ends. Tuck the ends of the anchor yarn underneath the loom. The anchor yarn will be removed once you're finishing the blanket, but it will help you handle the blanket as it becomes long on the loom."

  "text":" Casting On Gather the materials for your knit blanket. Set a rectangular loom with 64 pegs on each side on your work surface. Adjust the loom so there is 1.1 inch (3 cm) between each peg. You'll also need 6 skeins of bulky yarn, scissors and a knitting tool or crochet hook. Each skein should weigh 6 ounces (170 g) or measure 169 meters (185 yards). Make a slip knot. Twist your yarn into a loop so there's a 6 to 8 inch (15 to 20 cm) tail at the end. Hold the ends of the yarn and use your other hand to pull the loop wide. Pull the yarn that's connected to the ball of yarn through the loop about halfway. It should now form a loose knot. Secure the slip knot to a peg. Push the slip knot onto the peg that's on the upper row and farthest to the left. Lift up the loom a little so you can slide the yarn tail under the leg of the loom and set the loom back down. This will ensure that you don't accidentally work the yarn tail. Pull gently on the working yarn so the slip knot tightens around the peg. Wrap the yarn around alternating between upper and lower rows. Take the yarn and wrap it on the peg that's second to the left on the lower row. Pull the yarn back to the upper row and skip a peg. Wrap the yarn around the third peg from the left. Continue to work around every other peg as you move back and forth between the upper and lower rows. Work to the end of the loom. Work the yarn back across the loom. When you reach the end of the loom on the lower row, bring the yarn up and around the last peg on the right of the upper row. #Pull the yarn down and around the lower peg that's second from the right. Work the yarn back down the rest of the row by wrapping it around the pegs that you skipped earlier. You should be alternating between the upper and lower rows. Attach the anchor yarn in a different color. Take a 4 to 5 foot (1.2 to 1.5 m) piece of yarn that's in a different color and lay it across the loom so there are even lengths at both ends. For example, you may have 3 inches (7.5 cm) of an anchor tail at both ends. Tuck the ends of the anchor yarn underneath the loom. The anchor yarn will be removed once you're finishing the blanket, but it will help you handle the blanket as it becomes long on the loom. Push the yarn down along the pegs. Use the side of your hand to push all of the yarn that you've worked on the pegs down. The yarn should be at the bottom of each peg. This will allow you to work the blanket on the pegs. Working the Blanket Start the stockinette stitch on the loom. Take the yarn from the lower left peg and bring up directly up to the leftmost peg on the upper row. Wrap it around this peg and then bring it down to the lower row. Skip a peg and wrap it around the next peg. Continue to stockinette stitch across the loom. Work the yarn around every other peg while you alternate between the upper and lower rows. Bring it to the right end of the loom and then work it back to the left end of the loom. Knit over the lower row of stitches. Take your knitting tool or crochet hook and insert it below the yarn on the lower row's leftmost peg. Hook the yarn and pull it up and over the same peg to secure the yarn. Knit over half of the stitches on the lower row of the loom going from left to right. Then move to the right end of the lower row and knit over back to the center of the loom. Splitting the knit over stitches from left to right will make the blanket form evenly. Knit over the upper row of stitches. Tilt the loom towards you so you can insert your knitting tool or crochet hook into the right side of the upper row. Knit over each peg and work your way to the middle of the loom. Then move to the left end of the row and knit over every stitch to get to the center of the loom. If you prefer, you can turn the loom instead of tilting it. This completes one row of stockinette stitch. Push down the yarn and make 2 more passes. Use the side of your hand to evenly push the yarn down towards the bottom of the pegs. You can also tug on the ends of the anchor yarn to bring the yarn on your loom down. Stockinette stitch across the loom 2 more times so your yarn ends up on the left. Knit over the stitches to complete another row of stockinette stitch. Stockinette stitch until the blanket measures 5 feet (1.5 m). Keep wrapping the yarn around the pegs and knitting over them to create the stockinette stitch. Once you've used 5 skeins of yarn or the blanket is 5 feet (1.5 m), you can begin to bind the blanket off of the loom. Binding Off Insert your knitting tool into the rightmost peg on the upper row. If you prefer, use a crochet hook to pick up the stitch on the peg. Slide the entire stitch on to the tool or hook and then pick up the leftmost stitch on the upper row. Slide the stitch onto the tool or hook so you have 2 stitches on it. As you bind off, you'll move closer to the tail end of the yarn. Knit over the stitches on your tool or hook. Use your fingers to lift the first stitch on the tool or hook over the stitch that you just put on. This will knit them together so they become 1 stitch. Pick up another stitch and knit over it. Insert your tool or hook into the next peg on the opposite row and lift the stitch. Once you have it on your tool or hook, lift the first stitch over it to combine them. Continue to bind off across the loom and cut the yarn. Keep picking up stitches and knitting them together. You'll see the blanket gradually being cast off of the pegs as you go. When you get to the end of the loom you should have 1 stitch on your tool or hook. Cut the yarn to leave a 4 to 5 inch (10 to 12 cm) tail. Wrap the tail and knot the end of the yarn. Remove the final stitch from your tool or hook and insert the tail through it to make a loop. Pull tightly to make a knot and weave the tail into the blanket. You'll also need to weave in any yarn tails from when you added a skein of yarn. Use the anchor yarn to bind off the other end of the blanket. Insert your tool or hook into the rightmost stitch on the end of your blanket. This should be the stitch that's farthest from your yarn tail. Pull another stitch onto your tool and use your fingers to lift the stitch over the first stitch you put on the tool. Continue to add a stitch and knit over using the anchor yarn as a guide. Tie off the last stitch and remove the anchor yarn. When you have 1 stitch left on your tool or hook, pull the tail through it to make a loop. Pull tightly to knot the yarn. Weave the yarn tail through the blanket. Find the anchor yarn tail and pull it to remove it from the blanket.",
