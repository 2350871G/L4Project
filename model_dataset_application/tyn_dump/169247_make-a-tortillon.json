  "text":" Preparing Your Tortillon Gather your supplies. To create the tortillon, you will need a blank piece of copy paper (recommended size A4) a ruler, a pencil and a pair of scissors. You will be able to create two usable tortillons for every one piece of copy paper you prepare. A4 paper is 210mm wide and 297mm long (approximately 8 1/4 x 11 3/4 inches.) Draw a straight line. To do this, measure 1\u201d down the side of your paper and mark it with your pencil. Flip your paper and measure 1\u201d down on the other side. Connect your ruler between the two pencil markings and draw your straight line. Cut your paper.
