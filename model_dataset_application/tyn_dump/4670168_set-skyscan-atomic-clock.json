It will automatically search for a signal at 2 AM for eight minutes each night. Setting a SkyScan Clock with a Weather Station Transmitter Set one to three of the transmitters on the clock/weather station. Transmitters display the current humidity and temperature indoors and outside that the remote unit monitors. Remove the transmitter from the stand and unscrew the battery door of the transmitter.
