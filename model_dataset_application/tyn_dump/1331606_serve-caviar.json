The third type is Sevruga, which is the most inexpensive, and it has small, crunchy eggs and a very full flavor. Standard caviar is from sturgeon fish in the Caspian sea. Other types of fish eggs are also sold as caviar, such as bowfin, paddlefish, and salmon; however, these varieties will be labelled as so. American bowfin caviar is a relatively inexpensive and popular type which has a tangy flavor. Salmon caviar are large, orange- or peach-colored eggs. This type is commonly found in Canada, the United States, and Russia."

As a general guideline, when serving caviar alone, \u00bd - 1 oz (14.2 - 28.4 g) per person is standard. If you are serving caviar along with other foods, you won't need as much per person. Caviar is often sold in 2 oz (56.8 g) tins, which serves 2-4 people if the caviar is being served alone. You can purchase caviar from some grocery stores, markets, online, or directly from a caviar farm. The cost of caviar varies largely, and it depends on the species of fish and where you purchase it from.

Pairing Caviar with Food and Beverages Serve caviar on blinis for a traditional dish. Whisk 7/8 cup (100 g) of plain flour, 1 egg yolk, and 3 tbsp (75 ml) of milk together until the mixture is smooth. Then fold 1 beaten egg white, an extra 3 tbsp (75 ml) of milk, and 1 3/4 tbsp (25 g) of melted butter into the mixture.

Remove the crust from each slice of white bread, and cut the bread into triangular pieces. Butter the bread and toast it in the toaster until it's golden brown, which will take approximately 2-3 minutes. Serve a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkle of finely diced green onion, and a spoon of caviar on each toast point. Present the caviar with plain bread to make a more filling dish. Slice a loaf of white bread. Serve the bread with organic butter, and let the guests serve themselves a spoonful of caviar on a slice of bread. This is an ideal way to bulk out the caviar and to stretch it further among your guests. Serve the caviar with crackers or crispbread for easy appetizers. Caviar goes well with subtle foods so that you can enjoy the full flavor of the delicacy. Try a variety of gourmet crackers, crispbreads, or miniature wafer crackers. Although a range of crackers work well with caviar, try to stick to the lighter types as these provide a good contrast to the texture of the caviar. Plain and unsalted water or rice crackers pair the best with caviar. Serve the caviar with champagne for a luxurious pairing. Caviar has a high salt and fat content, which means that it matches nicely with a light, dry champagne. The champagne refreshes the palate and helps to turn the caviar into something even more special. Avoid pairing sweet champagnes with caviar, as the drier, the better. Have caviar with vodka for a traditional combination. Serve the vodka chilled and neat. Use either shot glasses or cocktail glasses for the vodka. Don't use mixers or ice when pairing vodka and caviar. The smooth, clean taste of vodka makes it an ideal palate cleanser for caviar. Eating Caviar Smell the caviar before you taste it.
