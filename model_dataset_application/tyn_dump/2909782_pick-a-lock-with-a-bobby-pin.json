The pins are small metal cylinders that sink into the barrel, holding it in place until a key (or your pick) pushes them up and out of the way. The pins are cut in half, and when the halfway mark lines up with the barrel you can turn the lock. Your job, as a lock picker, is to manually push up each of the pins into the correct position, slowly turning the barrel so that they can't call back into place. Once you've got all the pins out of the way, the barrel will turn freely and the door will be open. A key is basically a complex pick. The groves are tuned so that, once inserted, all the pins are perfectly aligned and you can turn the doorknob."
