      "description":"Place potting soil in shallow containers. Set the Brandywine seeds into the containers, about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) deep. Fill a pan with water and place the containers in the pan until the soil has soaked up all the water. Place the containers in a warm location, ideally about 75 degrees F (24 degrees C). Move your containers to a warm, well-lit location as soon as the seedlings pop up (about 5 or 6 days). Keep them there until the last frost, when you are ready to plant."

      "headline":"Choose a location for your Brandywine tomatoes.",
      "description":"Check your soil. Brandywines prefer a soil with a pH of about 6.5, with less nitrogen. Too much nitrogen will encourage more foliage on the tomatoes and less fruit. Make sure the soil is well draining and supplemented with organic material. Choose a location with lots of space and full sun. Because of their heavy foliage, Brandywine tomatoes need extra space to grow."
