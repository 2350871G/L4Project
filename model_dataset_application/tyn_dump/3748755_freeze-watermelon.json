Then, lay the halves flat and cut them vertically in half. Another way to divide the watermelon is by cutting it into thin slices. Split it in half first, then continue cutting it horizontally into slices about 1 in (2.5 cm) thick. You can also remove the rind before cutting into the fruit. Cut 1 end off so you can stand the watermelon up. Then, gradually slice off the rind on all sides."

Before cutting up the remaining fruit, pick out any black seeds and throw them away. Although you can dispose of the rind if you don\u2019t want it, it does have many nutrients and applications.

Try to keep all of the pieces roughly the same size so they freeze at the same rate. To make melon balls, use a melon baller. It is kind of like an ice cream scoop. You can use it after slicing the whole watermelon in half. Watermelon slices and wedges can be frozen, but they tend to take up a lot of space. They will also lose their texture in the freezer, so they aren\u2019t good when eaten raw. Watermelon juice or puree can also be frozen in a container or as ice cubes.
