You can purchase these carts at department stores or specialty retailers that specialize in kitchen and cooking goods. Before purchasing a kitchen cart, make sure you have ample space in your kitchen for it. You can read the size of the cart on the box or online before purchase. Then, measure the available space in your kitchen to make sure that the cart can fit. You can place appliances, pots, pans, and dishware on a kitchen cart."

Use a stud finder to find the studs or the wooden planks that you can screw your shelf mounts into. Mark where the studs are with a pencil, then use a level to draw a straight horizontal line where your shelving will go. You can purchase a stud finder at hardware stores.

Measure the area with a tape measure and write down your wall measurements on a piece of paper. Use a level when measuring horizontal lines so that your rack will also be level. If you have more pots and pans, you'll need a larger pipe or you'll need to have multiple pipe racks on your wall.

After you've created the layout and have measured all the pieces, it's time that you cut the pipe to fit the space in your kitchen. Proceed to cut your pipe down with a pipe cutter. Make sure to take into account the connector pieces, as well as the size of your wall flanges or pipe hangers when measuring out your pipe. You can purchase copper or galvanized piping at most hardware stores. Use either a 3/4-inch (1.9 cm) thick or 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) thick copper pipe for this project. You can use a hacksaw or a pipe slice instead of a pipe cutter to cut down your pipe."

Wall flanges are larger and often square or circular pieces of metal that screw into the wall. Pipe and bell hangers are smaller and made specifically for copper tubing."
