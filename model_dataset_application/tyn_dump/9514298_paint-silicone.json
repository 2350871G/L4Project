          "description":"Part of the reason paint won\u2019t stick well to silicone is because of how smooth the silicone is. Denatured alcohol will act as sandpaper to roughen up the surface of the silicone. Pour the alcohol onto a rag and wipe it over the surface of the silicone caulk. Leave it for 5 to 10 minutes and it will evaporate on its own. Denatured alcohol has additives which makes it non-drinkable. You can find it at supermarkets, like Walmart, and at home improvement stores. Denatured alcohol has the effect of sandpaper as far as changing the texture of the silicone, but it is more effective than actual sandpaper would be."

Use scissors to cut the tip of the applicator on the bottle at a 45-degree angle. Then, load it into a caulking gun. Use the caulking gun to apply the acrylic latex to the caulk. Wait 10 minutes for it dry before moving on to the next step.Apply steady and firm pressure while using the caulking gun. A caulking gun can be purchased at any home improvement store.
