          "description":"Hanging curtains with adhesive hooks is the best choice for mirrored walls because you can\u2019t drill holes into mirrors. Start at one top corner and measure 6 inches (15 cm) in from the side and 3 inches (7.6 cm) down from the top. Mark the point with a marker or a piece of tape. Then repeat the same measurements from the other corner. If the mirror leaves some of the wall exposed, you can still use adhesive hooks to avoid putting holes in the wall. If you prefer a more secure curtain rod, then screw  hooks into the exposed wall."

Hold it for 30 seconds. Then take the hook and slide it into the notch on the wall attachment. Repeat this same process for the hook on the opposite side of the mirror.

    "If you have a small area to cover, you may be able to order one sheet made to those dimensions.",
    "Wipe the glass with glass cleaner.",
    "Make sure the mirror is completely clean before working on it.",
    "Spray it with glass cleaner and wipe it down with a clean rag.",
    "Let all of the moisture evaporate so the mirror is dry.",
    "Peel off the top 3 inches (7.6 cm) of the wallpaper backing.",
    "Don\u2019t peel off the whole backing at once.",
    "This makes installation very difficult.",
    "Just pull off 3 inches (7.6 cm) at a time.",
    "Then when you\u2019ve stuck some wallpaper to the mirror, remove a bit more backing.",
    "Working with a partner makes this job much easier.",
    "One of you can pull the backing off while the other presses the wallpaper down.",
    "Press the wallpaper down starting in the top corner of the mirror.",
    "Line up the top corner of the wallpaper with the top corner of the mirror.",
    "Make sure both the top and side edges are even with each other.",
    "When the corners are lined up, press down on the wallpaper and stick it to the mirror.",
    "Run your hand across the wallpaper and apply smooth pressure to work out any air bubbles.",
    "Don\u2019t press down until the edges are lined up.",
    "If you peel the wallpaper off after making a mistake, it won\u2019t stick as well.",
    "Stand on a step stool if you can't reach the top of the mirror.",
    "Peel off more backing and press the wallpaper down.",
    "Once the top is in place, work down the mirror gradually.",
    "Peel off 3 inches (7.6 cm) more backing and press the wallpaper down.",
    "Keep working down the mirror in small increments like this until you reach the bottom.",
    "Use a wallpaper brush or squeegee to smooth out the wallpaper.",
    "Press down with even pressure against the wallpaper surface.",
    "Don\u2019t rush.",
    "If you work too fast, your wallpaper could be uneven.",
    "Remember that working with a partner makes this job much easier.",
    "You can press down the wallpaper while your partner removes the backing, or vice versa.",
    "Cut the bottom in a straight line if there is excess wallpaper.",
    "If you\u2019re working with a roll of wallpaper, then there will be excess leftover when you reach the bottom of the mirror.",
    "Use scissors to cut away leftover wallpaper the bottom.",
    "Be sure to cut in a straight line.",
    "If there is still some coming off at the bottom, snip along the bottom of the mirror to remove it.",
    "Even if you ordered a custom-sized wallpaper roll, there might be a bit sticking off the side.",
    "Use scissors to trim it away.",
    "Repeat the process across the whole mirror.",
    "After completing this first row, move over and work on the rest of the mirror.",
    "Unroll a bit more wallpaper and line it up with the top edge and the edge of the first sheet.",
    "Remove 3 inches (7.6 cm) of backing and press it down, working down the mirror like before.",
    "Work across the mirror until you cover the whole thing.",
    "It\u2019s okay if the wallpaper overlaps a little bit, but try to minimize the overlap.",
    "If the wallpaper has a specific design, use it to keep the sheets even with each other.",
    "For example, a line pattern might repeat multiple times on each wallpaper roll.",
    "Line up the pattern when you lay down the next sheet to keep the wallpaper straight.",
    "Temporary wallpaper is completely removable, so if you don\u2019t like the results, just peel it off.",
    "Painting Over the Mirror Lay drop cloths underneath the mirror.",
    "Painting is always a messy job, so protect your floors.",
    "Lay a drop cloth underneath all the mirrors you'll be working on.",
    "Plastic sheets will work as well.",
    "Sand the mirror with a fine-grain sandpaper.",
    "This roughs up the mirror surface so paint can stick better.",
    "Sand over the whole mirror surface with light, even pressure.",
    "Don\u2019t try to sand hard and make the whole mirror rough.",
    "Just a light sanding works fine.",
    "For an easier job, tape the sandpaper to a paint roller.",
    "Then roll it over the mirror to sand it faster.",
    "Clean the glass off with glass cleaner.",
    "Sanding may leave some dust or residue behind.",
    "Before you paint the mirror, make sure it\u2019s completely clean.",
    "Spray it with glass cleaner and wipe it down with a clean rag.",
    "Let all of the moisture evaporate so the mirror is dry.",
    "If you don\u2019t have glass cleaner, a damp rag will also pick up sanding residue.",
    "Apply a primer designed for glass to the mirror.",
    "Go to the hardware store and buy a primer designed to stick on glass.",
    "Pour some into a paint tray and wet a roller.",
    "Then roll an even coat of primer out.",
    "Use an up and down motion to lay a line of primer from the bottom to the top of the mirror.",
    "When you finish start a new line, overlap the previous line by half to ensure you get good coverage.",
    "Keep working until you cover the whole mirror.",
    "Roll the primer out with even pressure, but don't press hard.",
    "Pressing too hard leaves lines on each side of the roller.",
    "If you see lines forming, lighten the pressure.",
    "Don\u2019t let the primer drip or pool.",
    "Rub away any drips to smooth the surface out.",
    "Remember to prime all of the mirrors you\u2019re covering.",
    "Let the primer dry for at least 3 hours.",
    "The primer needs enough time to dry so it binds to the glass.",
    "Drying time varies, but give the primer at least 3 hours before you paint over it.",
    "If you don\u2019t have another roller and paint tray, clean the tools you used so the paint doesn\u2019t mix with primer.",
    "Cover the mirror with enamel glass paint.",
    "Enamel paints are designed to adhere to glass.",
    "Pour some out into a clean paint tray and dip your roller in.",
    "Then apply the paint with the same motion and pressure you used to roll the primer on.",
    "Work bottom to top and roll a line of paint on the mirror.",
    "When you start a new line, overlap the previous line halfway.",
    "Remember to use light pressure.",
    "If you see lines forming, use less pressure.",
    "Work down the mirror until it's fully covered.",
    "Paint over every mirror and let the paint dry for 24 hours.",
    "The paint may dry sooner, but wait at least 24 hours before adding a final coat.",
    "Enamel paint is available from hardware or craft stores.",
    "Acrylic paint will also stick to glass, but it is often see-through, so it\u2019s not a good choice to cover the whole mirror with.",
    "It\u2019s usually used for smaller arts and crafts projects.",
    "Use it if you want to make smaller designs on the mirror rather than covering it entirely.",
    "Complete the job with a second coat of paint.",
    "After 24 hours have passed, apply a final coat of paint with the same motions you used before.",
    "Allow another 24 hours for the topcoat to dry completely and then enjoy your new paint job.",
    "Remember that mirrors are under this paint.",
    "Don\u2019t forget and try to hammer any nails into the wall."
