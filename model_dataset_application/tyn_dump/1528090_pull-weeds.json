In general, you want to find a pair of gardening gloves that are comfortable and reasonably durable. Use whatever pair of gardening gloves you have in your shed. Any pair will do for weeding, but it is preferable to have a pair with wrist closure. Purchase a new pair of gardening gloves from a home and garden center. Look for a pair that fits your hands and has some design features such as reinforced fingertips, double stitching, and wrist closure. If you're weeding abrasive or pointy weeds, like thistle, get gloves made of leather or another thick material."

          "description":"Weeding tools are great if you want to keep your hands clean or if you are weeding in an area that is particularly tough, such as an area with hard soil or a high concentration of weeds. Weeding tools are also great if you want to save some energy, since using your hands to weed can be quite exhausting. You should go to the shed and pick up the weeding tools you need for your job. If you are weeding in a tightly planted area and will be working on your knees, you will need a short handled weeding tool. If you are weeding a large area of the garden and plan to complete the weeding standing up, you will need a long handled weeding tool. If you do not have the right weeding tools for your job, you may need to visit your local home and garden center to purchase an appropriate weeding tool. If you are buying a new weeding tool, you may want to examine the sharpness of the tool, whether it is made with good materials (for example, a stainless steel blade), and whether or not it will work for the most common weeding tasks in your garden. You should also consider whether you can comfortably grip the tool in your hands. The Japanese farmer's knife is a type of short handled weeding tool that can be used to stab and saw through roots and pull up tough weeds. The Cape Cod weeder is a type of short handled weeding tool that is especially good for weeding in tight spaces of your garden. The radius pro weeder is a long handled weeder that has a circular handle, which is great for people with arthritis or wrist troubles. The weed dragon garden torch cooks your weeds to eliminate them for good. It emits a flame that cooks the weeds and eventually kills them, since they are then unable to take in nutrients."

Weeding is exhausting work that usually involves exposure to the sun, so you will need to protect your face, neck and any other exposed parts of your body. Use a sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher. If you have fair skin, you should be using at least SPF 30. The SPF number tells you how well the sunscreen protects you from burning. Choose a sunscreen that has good water or sweat resistance. Weeding is tough work that involves some sweating, so you should make sure your sunscreen can stand up to the job. If you are weeding in a greenhouse or indoors, you can skip this step."

If there is stinging nettle in the area, take a note of where it is located so you can avoid being stung. If there are poisonous snakes in your area, take a look to make sure there aren't any in your garden. On hot days, watch out for snakes in cool and shady areas.
