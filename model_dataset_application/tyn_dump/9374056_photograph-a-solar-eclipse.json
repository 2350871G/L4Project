Conduct some research to find out if the area where you live falls within the path of totality, or the vantage point from which the sun is completely covered by the moon. The people within the path of totality, which typically encompasses an area about 10,000 miles (16,000 km) long and only 100 miles (160 km) wide, will have the best view of the proceedings.

You can usually find the eye protection you need at local hardware store in the weeks leading up to the eclipse. Just make sure the glasses you pick up bear the ISO 12312-2 certification code, which confirms that they meet international safety regulations. If you\u2019re having trouble tracking down eclipse glasses in stores, you can always purchase them online. Only buy from reputable vendors to be sure that you\u2019re getting a quality product. As long as you\u2019re wearing eye protection, you\u2019ll be able to catch a glimpse without worrying about damaging your vision.

What solar filters do is cancel out just enough of the most penetrating light to allow the sun to show up on camera. Most solar filters can simply be slid or screwed into place over the lens. Once it\u2019s in place, you\u2019ll need to leave it on both leading up to and after totality. The brief period of totality is the only time that it\u2019s safe to photograph the eclipse without the aid of a filter. Look for solar filters of the correct size and specifications on websites that specialize in astronomy accessories. Most newer smartphone and digital camera models will work just fine without a separate solar filter.

Somewhere in the 500mm-1000mm range will usually provide the most satisfying results\u2014large enough to see in clear detail, but not zoomed in so far that you crop the outer edges of the corona or miss a stray solar flare. With a wide-angle lens, the sun will appear too far away to make for a striking picture. A standard telephoto lens will help enlarge it, but there will still be an undesirable amount of blank space within the frame. Use your own judgment to decide which focal length is best for the image you want to create. The most important thing is being able to fit the entire eclipse in the frame."

Since your camera will be pointed directly at the sun for a long period of time, it\u2019s a good idea to start with the lowest native aperture setting and work your way up incrementally as needed. On most higher-end models, somewhere between f/5.6 and f/8 will be the sweet spot. The amount of light is also known as \u201cexposure,\u201d and it can be the difference between a photo that\u2019s crisp and clear and one that\u2019s washed out or oversaturated.

At 1/4000 or 1/8000, every glowing wisp and dazzling streak of the corona will be plainly visible. With a high (fast) shutter speed, the camera\u2019s sensor is only exposed to light for a split second, effectively freezing an image. Lower (slow) shutter speeds let the light linger, which can result in a blurry, smeared effect. It may be necessary to alter your shutter speed to successfully track the moon\u2019s progress as the light grows faint."

Make sure you take some time to familiarize yourself with what each feature does before the day of your shoot. That way, you can be sure that you'll walk away with some dazzling images and not an endless string of washed out black frames. Carry out a few sessions in a low-light setting, like a dark room or moonlit night, to mimic the conditions of shooting an eclipse as closely as possible.

In the seconds before and after totality, \u201cbracketing\u201d your exposure will maximize your chances of getting true-to-life light levels. One simple way to do this is to increase or decrease your shutter speed\u2014the longer the shutter is open, the more light the lens will take in, and vice versa. More sophisticated cameras sometimes have an auto-bracketing feature, which will allow you to set the shutter speed to predetermined \u201cstops,\u201d or degrees of exposure. Take some time to figure out your preferred exposure settings a few days before the actual phenomenon by practicing on the unobstructed sun.

That way, an artificial secondary light source won\u2019t interfere with the natural light peeking out from behind the moon. The sun itself will provide plenty of illumination, even while it\u2019s obscured, so there\u2019s no need to worry about your shot being too dark. Even the brightest flash will be too weak to compete with the sunlight, but it\u2019s possible for it to affect the look of your immediate surroundings on film.

This is when you\u2019ll be rewarded with the most stunning photos. Remember to keep the entire radius of the eclipse in the frame to include all of the little details and tricks of light. Be prepared to remove and replace your solar filter quickly so you don\u2019t waste a moment. Totality typically only lasts around a minute.

Whether you\u2019re putting together a spread for a nature magazine or just shooting for your own enjoyment, be sure to pause for few moments to take it all in. It may be decades before you get another chance. Get the sun centered in your viewfinder early so you can step away and get a firsthand look.

    "The sun itself will provide plenty of illumination, even while it\u2019s obscured, so there\u2019s no need to worry about your shot being too dark.",
    "Even the brightest flash will be too weak to compete with the sunlight, but it\u2019s possible for it to affect the look of your immediate surroundings on film.",
    "Inadvertent flash could spoil the ambient lighting for other photographers nearby.",
    "Remove the solar filter during totality.",
    "As mentioned, the fleeting moments when the moon is hiding the sun are the only time it will be safe to shoot without the protection of your solar filter.",
    "This is when you\u2019ll be rewarded with the most stunning photos.",
    "Remember to keep the entire radius of the eclipse in the frame to include all of the little details and tricks of light.",
    "Be prepared to remove and replace your solar filter quickly so you don\u2019t waste a moment.",
    "Totality typically only lasts around a minute.",
    "Shooting totality with the solar filter still in place will just result in a dim, unimpressive approximation of the eclipse\u2019s true glory.",
    "Don\u2019t miss out on viewing the event for yourself.",
    "While photographing a solar eclipse can be a fun and exciting project, nothing compares to seeing it with your own 2 eyes.",
    "Whether you\u2019re putting together a spread for a nature magazine or just shooting for your own enjoyment, be sure to pause for few moments to take it all in.",
    "It may be decades before you get another chance.",
    "Get the sun centered in your viewfinder early so you can step away and get a firsthand look.",
    "Don\u2019t waste time struggling with an uncooperative camera.",
    "If you happen to experience technical difficulties, just set your equipment aside and enjoy the show."
