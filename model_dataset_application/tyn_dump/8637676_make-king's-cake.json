Add the flour 1 cup (100 grams) at a time. Pour in 1 cup (100 grams) of flour, and give the batter a stir with a rubber spatula. Keep adding in the flour, 1 cup (100 grams) at a time, stirring after each addition. At the very end, stir in the final \u00bd cup (50 grams) of flour.

Baking the Cake Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper. If you don't have any parchment paper, lightly grease the baking sheets instead. Prepare the filling. Pour the brown sugar into a mixing bowl. Add the ground cinnamon, chopped pecans, and flour. Stir the melted butter into the filling until it turns crumbly.

Halfway through the baking, switch the racks that the cakes are on. This way, they will bake evenly. Decorating the Cakes Push a small, plastic, baby doll into the bottom of each cake. You don't have to do this, but it's what makes the cake traditional. The person who finds the plastic baby typically has to host the next party. Some traditions say that he or she has to make the next cake. If you can't find a baby figurine, or don't want to use one, try an orange wedge or a pecan half instead. They are edible and less likely to hurt someone's teeth! Place the cakes onto serving dishes. If you want to, you can use a cardboard cake platter instead.
