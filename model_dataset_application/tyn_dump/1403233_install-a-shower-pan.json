Your home center professional will help you select the correct size based on the measurements. Most modern shower pans are either acrylic or fiberglass for ease of installation, but keep in mind that some shower pans may have to be special ordered if they\u2019re not a standard model or size. Find this out before you tear out your existing shower. Standard sizes are 36\u201d x 36\u201d; 36\u201d x 42\u201d; 36\u201d x 48\u201d and are usually available in white or almond.

          "description":"The first thing you\u2019ll need to do after preparing the shower base area is \u201cdry-fit\u201d your shower pan within the space. Dry fitting means that you won't use any adhesives or fasteners at this time, because you're just checking to make sure everything fits. Be sure the pan fits snugly within the space, but not too tight or the pan may buckle. If the fit is too sloppy, you are likely to have movement issues that can cause seams to separate and create serious water seepage. A fit that is too loose will require additional stabilization of the pan. Check to see if the drain cut-out in the pan lines up and fits properly over the drain pipe. Never force it to line up, as this can cause damage to the pan and to the drain pipe. A little movement (about a half-inch or so in each direction) of the pipe is fine, and will help when lining up the drain components. Since drain components vary by manufacturer, follow the illustrations that come with your shower pan for test fitting. Once you are satisfied that everything fits properly, you are ready to complete the permanent installation."

Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on attaching drain hardware. Some drain installations may require a short coupling piece to be attached to the bottom of the drain attached to the pan, then slipped into the drain pipe in the floor, sealed with a compression gasket. Others may require a coupling extension pre-inserted into the floor\u2019s drain pipe, then the pan slips over the coupler and is sealed with caulking and a rubber compression ring.

You can temporarily secure the pan to the studs by placing a 1 \u00bd\u201d or 2\u201d screw through a washer, then insert the screw just above the lip of the pan so the washer overlaps the lip to hold it securely. Do not over-tighten, as this may crack the shower pan. Use your carpenter's level again to make sure your fastening didn't throw the pan off slightly. When the pan is level, stable and securely mounted, it\u2019s time to make all components water-tight."

Also seal around the studs where the pan makes contact, helping to secure the pan. Use a thin coat of caulk, about the thickness of a piece of masking tape, spread over each penetration location. Use just enough to coat and seal where nails or screws are used to attach the pan to the studs. Wipe up any accidental drips of caulk from the pan before they dry. If you discover them after they dry, you can usually peel them up with your fingernail or a plastic putty knife. As you're working, don't let any caulk run over the lip of the pan, as doing so can affect the fit and seal of the side shower panels. If it runs over while being applied, wipe it off before it dries. You'll also need to caulk the joint where the pan meets the floor. Be sure the surface is very clean and dry or you will not obtain a proper seal."
