If you need to move the active door closer to the door frame, rotate the positioning screw clockwise by a half-turn at a time. If you need to move the door out from the frame, then turn the screw counterclockwise. Check the distance between the doors and the frame to make sure they are all uniform in size. If your door is sagging down and sticking at the top, then tighten the top and middle hinges. If it\u2019s sticking at the bottom, then adjust the bottom hinge. Open and close the door while you work to see how your adjustments affect the door.Tip: Adjusting the hinges on your French doors can also fix a sticky latch if your door is difficult to open."

Remove the screws on the hinge plate attached to the door frame and replace them with wood screws that are least 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) long. The longer screws will help support the weight of the doors better. Only replace the screws in 1 hinge at a time so your door doesn\u2019t fall out of the frame."
