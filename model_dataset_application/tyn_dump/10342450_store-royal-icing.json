After remixing the icing, if it isn\u2019t smooth and has an off consistency, chances are it has gone bad and needs to be discarded.

  "text":" Keeping Royal Icing in the Fridge Transfer your unused royal icing to a large, clean mixing bowl. Use a clean spoon or spatula to put your royal icing into a glass or stainless steel bowl. If your leftover icing is in a piping bag, simply pipe it into your storage container. If it\u2019s still in the mixing bowl from when you first made it, it\u2019s okay to leave it in there, too. Always make sure to use clean utensils and bowls when working with royal icing. Place a clean, damp dishcloth overtop of the mixing bowl. Take a clean dish rag and wet it thoroughly with water.
