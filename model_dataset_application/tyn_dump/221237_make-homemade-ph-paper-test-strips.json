These chemicals are known as anthocyanins and are found in plants such as cabbage, roses, and berries. Anthocyanins are purple under neutral conditions (pH 7.0) but they change color when exposed to an acid (pH < 7.0) or a base (pH>7.0). The same procedure can be followed using berries, roses, and other anthocyanin containing plants. This does not work for green cabbage. The same anthocyanins are not present in green cabbage."
