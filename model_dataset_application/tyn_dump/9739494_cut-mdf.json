This will give you a small layer of defense against rough MDF edges and your saw blade. To avoid getting caught in the saw blade, do not wear clothing with loose sleeves."

To make sure this dust doesn\u2019t get into your eyes or throat, wear a high quality dust mask and a pair of clear safety goggles while working. MDF dust particles are not inherently dangerous, but the sheer amount of them may lead to unwanted irritation."

If you don\u2019t have a clear space to work in, open any windows or doors near the cutting area so the dust has a way to escape. If you\u2019d like, place a fan in the room to help blow the dust outside. Cover objects around your working area in thin plastic sheets to keep them from getting dirty."

          "description":"To make straight cuts in your MDF, acquire a circular saw that has a cutting speed between 3,000 and 3,350 metres per second (9,800 and 11,000 ft/s). For the best cut possible, install a blade that has at least 60 teeth and a width of about 355 mm (14.0 in). For additional strength, pick a blade that has a carbide tip. You can find circular saws at most home improvement stores. High-quality models typically cost between $100 and $300. Before installing the blade, make sure you unplug the device to prevent any accidents."

Then, loosen your saw\u2019s depth knob or lever and carefully move the blade until the tip sits just below your MDF plank. When you\u2019ve positioned the blade where you want it, retighten the depth knob or lever. To ensure the blade cuts properly, try to position it so that the tip sits between \u20448 in (0.32 cm) and \u20444 in (0.64 cm) below the MDF plank."

Since you can only cut through the wood once, double check the line\u2019s length using a tape measure and its alignment using a level or L-square. If you\u2019re using a pencil, make sure the line is thick enough that you can see it easily from a distance."

Making Straight Cuts Attach a sturdy blade to a circular saw. To make straight cuts in your MDF, acquire a circular saw that has a cutting speed between 3,000 and 3,350 metres per second (9,800 and 11,000 ft/s).

Do your best to hold the saw steady, and make sure your cutting speed is slow and consistent. If you feel your saw jitter or kick, turn the device off and let it rest for a minute. Creating Curved Cuts Get a jigsaw with a bi-metal cutting blade. To make curved cuts in your MDF piece, acquire a jigsaw that is compatible with quick-change blades.
