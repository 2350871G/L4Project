          "description":"Scatter 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (130 g) of roasted peanuts on a rimmed baking sheet. Use a rolling pin or mug to crush the roasted peanuts into large chunks. Set the peanuts aside while you make the meringue. Use peanuts that are unsalted with the skins removed."

The meringue should turn white and become hot. If you want to check the meringue using an instant-read thermometer, the meringue should be 120 degrees F (50 C)."

Keep whisking the mixture on high for about 5 minutes. The meringue should become thick and glossy. If you lift the whisk attachment up, it will create stiff peaks in the meringue. If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer but it may take longer to whisk."

Pour in the remaining crushed peanuts and fold them in a little more. To fold the peanuts, hold the rubber spatula and use a twisting motion with your wrist to incorporate the peanuts into the meringue. The goal is to combine the peanuts without destroying the volume of the meringue."

Ensure that they're about 1-inch (2.5 cm) apart on the baking sheet. You can keep the meringues in a mound on the sheet. This will give them a classic shape as they bake."

They should puff a little and become dry around the sides. Don't worry if they crack a little. Let the meringues cool completely on a wire rack before you serve them. If you want crunchier meringues, bake them at 200 \u00b0F (93.3 \u00b0C) (90 C) for 45 minutes with the door propped open. You can store the meringues in an airtight container for up to two days."

Turn off the oven and let the meringues cool completely while they're still in the oven. Store the meringues in an airtight container immediately, since they will begin to absorb moisture. You can store them for up to two weeks. You should switch the baking sheets and rotate them after the first 45 minutes. This will ensure that the meringues bake evenly."
