    "Apple juice also works as a base for the flavor of your strawberries.",
    "Add the strawberries and banana slices.",
    "You can use fresh or frozen strawberries and banana slices.",
    "If you are using fresh strawberries, be sure to wash them and remove the crown (the green leafy stem at the top) of the strawberries before adding to your mixture.",
    "Add frozen yogurt.",
    "Scoop your vanilla frozen yogurt into the mixture.",
    "You can try regular frozen yogurt, non-fat frozen yogurt, or vanilla soy frozen yogurt.",
    "Add ice.",
    "Adding the hard ice after the strawberries will allow the blender blades to grind more effectively.",
    "If using frozen strawberries, you may prefer to reduce the amount of ice to 1/2 cup.",
    "Because the strawberries are frozen, they will already help make your smoothie cold and icy.",
    "Blend until smooth.",
    "Start by blending for about 5 seconds, pause, then blend again.",
    "Repeat until mixed.",
    "You may need to stir your smoothie with a spoon between mixes to ensure that no strawberries, banana slices, or ice cubes get stuck.",
    "Listen to the sound of the blender.",
    "If the blender is making a lot of noise, keep blending until the sound is smooth.",
    "Stir one last time with a spoon to ensure that your smoothie is completely blended.",
    "If your smoothie is still very slushy when you have finished blending, add additional cubes of ice until your smoothie reaches your desired consistency.",
    "Enjoy.",
    "Pour your smoothie into a chilled glass or cups to share.",
    "Top your smoothie off with a straw."
