    "You can scoop out a little bone marrow and spread it on a piece of toast, or you could spread a little onto a piece of steak.",
    "It works wonderfully as an accompaniment to a great piece of protein, or you can use it as an appetizer before a main course.",
    "Keep in mind that bone marrow is very rich, so you won\u2019t want to pair it with other heavy foods, like potatoes or pastas.",
    "Use a flavored butter to add additional flavors without using a garnish.",
    "If you\u2019re not into using fresh herbs to coat your bone marrow, consider using a flavored butter, like garlic butter, to enhance the rich flavor of the dish.",
    "Add the butter to the bone marrow before cooking or spread it onto the marrow once it comes out of the oven.",
    "Add blue cheese crumbles for a bitter, creamy accent.",
    "The bitter notes of the blue cheese pair really well with the rich, decadent nature of the bone marrow.",
    "Simply spread or crumble the cheese on top of the bone marrow to enjoy.",
    "You could also use goat cheese (or even an herbed goat cheese) for another flavor component."
