    "Secure the second disc with a locking nut.",
    "After tying the string to the spacer, slide the second disc onto the bolt.",
    "Add a \u20444 in (0.64 cm) washer, then twist a locking nut clockwise onto the bolt shaft to hold the yoyo together.",
    "Take care not to over-tighten the locking nut.",
    "Practice throwing the yo-yo, and adjust the tightness until it feels comfortable, spins nicely, and returns to your hand reliably.",
    "Decorate your yo-yo, if desired.",
    "If you\u2019d like, make designs on the sides of your yo-yo with felt-tip pens or paint.",
    "For instance, try making spirals or concentric circles in various colors.",
    "Alternatively, if you stained or oiled the surface, you could just leave the finish as is.",
    "You could also decorate the sides with cutouts as you would with a bottle cap yo-yo.",
    "However, you\u2019d need to punch a hole in the cutouts and include them under the bolt head and locking nut.",
    "Unscrew the nut and take the yo-yo apart, stick a cutout over the outside of each disc with double-sided tape, then put the yo-yo back together."
