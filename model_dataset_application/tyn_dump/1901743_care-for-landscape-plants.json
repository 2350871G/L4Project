          "description":"The temperature is lower during night and early morning, so less water evaporates off the ground. By taking advantage of these cooler periods, you ensure your plants get most of the water you give them. However, watering a plant at midday is better than giving it no water at all."

          "description":"Whenever you water a plant, make sure the soil looks soft and moist. Moist soil sticks together when you roll it between your fingers. Continue watering the area until you are sure the water has filtered down to the plant\u2019s roots. Check the soil by digging down into it, making sure it is moist underneath the surface. Be careful where you dig. You don\u2019t want to hit a root. Every plant has different water needs. Larger plants like cherry trees and dogwood, along with flowers and grasses may need more water than other\nFor larger trees and shrubs, let water trickle from a hose until the water reaches the root ball. Flowers and grasses can be watered normally."

          "headline":"Give water to new plants every 1 or 2 days.",
          "description":"New plants need more water to survive. Check the soil every day, ensuring that it stays moist. Do this for about a month. After that, the landscape plant should be well-established in your yard and can be watered less often. Some plants can survive up to 3 days or more between waterings. As long as the soil is moist down to the roots, any plant has a chance of thriving. When you get rain in your area, you won\u2019t need to add more water that day."

          "headline":"Water established plants once a week.",
          "description":"To maintain landscape plants after the first month, continue to water them regularly. Try to do this at the same time every week. When you water the plants, check the soil and the plant\u2019s appearance to see if the area has enough water. Monitor the weather conditions. If there is rain, you won\u2019t need to water your plants as often. During dry periods, your plants may need more frequent watering. Plants like trees, succulents, and drought-resistant bushes will need water less often than grasses and flowers."

          "headline":"Give water to plants if they look wilted and gray.",
          "description":"All flowers will wilt if they receive too little water. Unwatered plants appear dry, often drooping over. The plant's color fades, turning a gray-green shade. Also, look for signs of damage, such as shriveling and brown spots. For instance, grasses, woody shrubs and annuals like azaleas, use up a lot of water and will fade quickly if they don\u2019t have enough. Ornamental trees and drought-tolerant plants usually show they need watering by turning colors. Plants may wilt a bit in the midday sun, but this is normal and temporary."

Let the water drip into the soil for about 2 hours so the moisture reaches the plant's roots. You don\u2019t need to spray the plant or the soil. As long as the water soaks far enough into the soil, part of the root system will absorb it. Grasses and flowers have shorter roots, so you can water them with a hose, sprinkler, irrigation system, or watering can."

Keep the fertilizer about 1 in (2.5 cm) away from the plant\u2019s stem or trunk on all sides. Rake the fertilizer flat. You will need a layer approximately 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) distributed around each plant. The fertilized area should be 2 to 3 times the plant\u2019s width."

Do this every 2 to 3 months until the first frost occurs. Don't overdo the fertilization, as this can burn tender or damaged roots. If you plant a plant in a different season, give it fertilizer right away. Don\u2019t wait for spring."

Rake the fertilizer into a thin layer underneath the plant\u2019s branches, spreading it as far as the branches reach. Follow the directions on the fertilizer bag to ensure you don\u2019t give the plant too much. These plants are low-maintenance, so you do not need to use quick-release fertilizers."

Spread the mulch as far as the plant\u2019s leaves or branches reach. Mulching does not have to be done on all plants, but it can help. It is especially useful for larger plants. Mulching insulates plants from extreme weather, holds in water, prevents weeds, and protects the plant from damage. Fertilizer can be applied on top of mulch."

You can slope the soil so excess water runs down from poorly-draining areas. Use a testing kit to monitor your soil\u2019s pH. You can get a testing kit at a gardening center or home improvement store. Follow the directions on the kit to figure out the soil\u2019s pH. Some plants may grow better depending on the pH of your soil. Most plants can survive in a variety of soils. However, some plants prefer either acidic or basic soil. For example, many grasses and bulbs like tulips grow better in slightly acidic soil. Group plants with similar water and sunlight needs. Planning out your landscaping project this way simplifies your gardening work. You will have an easier time recognizing what each plant needs, as well as spotting any problems that arise. For example, plant juniper away from cranberry bushes. Cranberry bushes thrive in wet soil, but junipers prefer dry soil. For instance, if your bulbs and grasses begin to wilt, you might discover that their area of the garden needs more water. Plant your plants in the spring or fall. The weather is gentler during these seasons, so your plants have time to acclimate to the environment. Landscape plants will usually be sold during these time periods. Put your plants in the ground or in a pot as soon as you buy them. Fall is usually an ideal time to plant big bushes and trees. The plants will spread their roots in the winter, which helps them prosper in the next growing season. Most flowers and grasses should be planted in spring. Dig out enough soil to cover the plant\u2019s roots. Each plant needs to be set at the proper depth. This depends on the size of your plant and how much it will grow. When planting, shovel out dirt until the hole is about as twice as wide as the plant. The plant should rest comfortably in the hole with the surface of the soil resting right above the root crown. If plants are set too deeply in the ground, they may rot due to the water in the soil. Each plant should be spaced at least 2 in (5.1 cm) from neighboring plants. Give big bushes and trees extra growing space.",

    " Watering Your Plants Water the plants at night or in the early morning.",
    "The temperature is lower during night and early morning, so less water evaporates off the ground.",
    "By taking advantage of these cooler periods, you ensure your plants get most of the water you give them.",
    "However, watering a plant at midday is better than giving it no water at all.",
    "Moisten the soil at least 6 to 8 cm (2.4 to 3.1 in) deep.",
    "Whenever you water a plant, make sure the soil looks soft and moist.",
    "Moist soil sticks together when you roll it between your fingers.",
    "Continue watering the area until you are sure the water has filtered down to the plant\u2019s roots.",
    "Check the soil by digging down into it, making sure it is moist underneath the surface.",
    "Be careful where you dig.",
    "You don\u2019t want to hit a root.",
    "Every plant has different water needs.",
    "Larger plants like cherry trees and dogwood, along with flowers and grasses may need more water than other\nFor larger trees and shrubs, let water trickle from a hose until the water reaches the root ball.",
    "Flowers and grasses can be watered normally.",
    "Give water to new plants every 1 or 2 days.",
    "New plants need more water to survive.",
    "Check the soil every day, ensuring that it stays moist.",
    "Do this for about a month.",
    "After that, the landscape plant should be well-established in your yard and can be watered less often.",
    "Some plants can survive up to 3 days or more between waterings.",
    "As long as the soil is moist down to the roots, any plant has a chance of thriving.",
    "When you get rain in your area, you won\u2019t need to add more water that day.",
    "Water established plants once a week.",
    "To maintain landscape plants after the first month, continue to water them regularly.",
    "Try to do this at the same time every week.",
    "When you water the plants, check the soil and the plant\u2019s appearance to see if the area has enough water.",
    "Monitor the weather conditions.",
    "If there is rain, you won\u2019t need to water your plants as often.",

    "For instance, grasses, woody shrubs and annuals like azaleas, use up a lot of water and will fade quickly if they don\u2019t have enough.",
    "Ornamental trees and drought-tolerant plants usually show they need watering by turning colors.",
    "Plants may wilt a bit in the midday sun, but this is normal and temporary.",
    "Deep water your trees and large shrubs once every month.",
    "Turn your hose on low so a trickle of water flows out.",
    "Place the hose underneath the plant\u2019s branches.",
    "Let the water drip into the soil for about 2 hours so the moisture reaches the plant's roots.",
    "You don\u2019t need to spray the plant or the soil.",
    "As long as the water soaks far enough into the soil, part of the root system will absorb it.",
    "Grasses and flowers have shorter roots, so you can water them with a hose, sprinkler, irrigation system, or watering can.",
    "Fertilizing and Mulching Plants Choose a fertilizer that will amend your soil to the correct pH.",
    "A lime-based fertilizer increases the alkalinity of your soil.",
    "Sulfur raises the acidity.",
    "Apply this fertilizer around any plants regularly to get them the nutrients they need to grow.",
    "A neutral pH is 7 on the pH scale.",
    "Your county extension service or your local plant nursery can give you recommendations about what kind of fertilizer to purchase.",
    "Distribute fertilizer evenly over the planting area.",
    "If your pH test shows that your soil needs nutrients added to it, set down fertilizer right away.",
    "Keep the fertilizer about 1 in (2.5 cm) away from the plant\u2019s stem or trunk on all sides.",
    "Rake the fertilizer flat.",
    "You will need a layer approximately 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) distributed around each plant.",
    "The fertilized area should be 2 to 3 times the plant\u2019s width.",
    "Utilize quick-release fertilizers for smaller plants.",
    "Annuals, perennials, and woody shrubs like azaleas and rhododendrons need this type of fertilizer.",
    "Pour a small amount directly onto the soil according to the directions on the label.",
    "These plants need to be checked often to ensure they are getting enough water and nutrients, no less than once a week.",
    "Spread quick-release fertilizer every few months after March.",
    "Repeated fertilizing is beneficial for flowers and grasses, since they don\u2019t grow year-round.",
    "Pour the fertilizer near the plant, then water it until it is moist.",
    "Do this every 2 to 3 months until the first frost occurs.",
    "Don't overdo the fertilization, as this can burn tender or damaged roots.",
    "If you plant a plant in a different season, give it fertilizer right away.",

    "Large ornamental plants do not grow as fast and use up less resources.",
    "Rake the fertilizer into a thin layer underneath the plant\u2019s branches, spreading it as far as the branches reach.",
    "Follow the directions on the fertilizer bag to ensure you don\u2019t give the plant too much.",
    "These plants are low-maintenance, so you do not need to use quick-release fertilizers.",
    "Spread an organic mulch over the area to protect the plant.",
    "Pick up a natural mulch, such as ground pine.",
    "Cover the soil with a layer 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) deep.",
    "Spread the mulch as far as the plant\u2019s leaves or branches reach.",
    "Mulching does not have to be done on all plants, but it can help.",
    "It is especially useful for larger plants.",
    "Mulching insulates plants from extreme weather, holds in water, prevents weeds, and protects the plant from damage.",
    "Fertilizer can be applied on top of mulch.",
    "Eliminating Weeds and Insects Inspect your landscape daily for weeds.",
    "Look for sprouts in the soil near your plants.",
    "These need to be removed as soon as you notice them.",
    "If you let them linger, they can spread and crowd out your plants.",
    "Any weeds in your planting area can cause problems for your plants.",
    "Even if you aren\u2019t sure what type of plant they are, remove them.",
    "Weeds are primarily an issue for flowers.",
    "However, they are unsightly in grass and can grow under trees and bushes.",
    "Pull up on weeds to remove them.",
    "Most new weeds can be pulled out by hand.",
    "This draws out the entire plant so it can\u2019t grow back.",
    "If you need to get down to the roots, you can also dig into the soil with a trowel.",
    "Be careful so you can avoid disturbing your plant\u2019s roots.",
    "Tough weeds such as dandelions may force you to use a hand cultivator or trowel to remove them, as they have a large tap root.",
    "To ensure the weed doesn\u2019t return, remove the roots.",
    "Cutting and mowing isn\u2019t effective since it doesn\u2019t reach the roots.",
    "Spray weed-killer directly onto weeds.",
    "Purchase a weed-killer from a local gardening center.",
    "Bring the nozzle close to the area and spray it directly on the weeds.",
    "Use the chemical sparingly so it doesn\u2019t pollute your yard and harm your plants.",

    "Type a description of the damage into an online search box for suggestions on what to do about it.",
    "For example, a patch of what looks like black mold may be caused by aphids or whiteflies.",
    "The cause of the damage depends on what bugs and diseases are common in your area as well as the type of plant you have.",
    "Look for any insects on the plants.",
    "You can usually get a glimpse of any bugs infecting your plants.",
    "Flip over the leaves, looking closely for webs, tracks, and other telltale signs.",
    "Also monitor fruits as well as rotting stems and trunks.",
    "For instance, leaf-footed bugs are recognizable by their wide back legs.",
    "You may also spot the orange bodies of young leaf-footed bugs.",
    "Clean your planting area to prevent bug infestations.",
    "Harmful bugs congregate in places like wood piles and pools of stagnant water.",
    "Remove weeds as they come to eliminate food sources.",
    "Keeping your area maintained also encourages natural predators to live in the area.",
    "For example, proper maintenance can bring back birds, spiders, and assassin bugs that control the leaf-footed bug population.",
    "Treat plants with a safe pesticide to eliminate bugs.",
    "Healthy plants can survive some damage, but pesticides are needed to fend off severe infestations.",
    "If your plants are struggling, get an insecticide from a gardening center.",
    "Follow the directions on the label to dilute it, then spray it directly onto your plants.",
    "Be safe when using pesticides by covering your skin and keeping pets and family away.",
    "Pesticides can be used on all types of plants, from trees to flowers.",
    "Maintain your plants consistently to protect them from disease.",
    "Routine watering and fertilizing leads to healthier plants.",
    "Stronger plants are more resistant to diseases and insect damage.",
    "If you do notice damage in a healthy plant, this can be a sign that something else is wrong in your environment.",
    "For instance, root rot caused by a fungus usually means you need to remove the plant and clear the soil in that area.",
    "Root rot can threaten your plants, but you can avoid this by not over watering the plants.",
    "You should also have proper drainage.",
    "Pruning Your Plants Prune plants according to their needs.",
    "The optimal time to prune your plants will vary.",
    "Bushes and trees can usually be trimmed in early spring.",
    "Flowers can be trimmed after they bloom.",
    "Grass can be cut throughout the growing season.",
    "Plants generally need to be pruned after about a year of growth.",
    "You will need shears as well as gloves and goggles.",
    "Remove damaged and weak branches.",
    "These branches will still use up nutrients even if they stop growing and healing.",
    "Cut the branch off as close to the tree or bush as possible.",
    "Removing them allows the plant to grow newer, stronger branches.",
    "Check the branches for any signs of significant damage, such as breaks or rot.",
    "Reduce long or excessive plants.",
    "You probably have a set size in mind for your landscape plants.",
    "Stick to this plan by trimming your plant when it grows beyond its spot in your yard.",
    "Cut branches evenly so the plant stays uniform and shapely.",
    "Thin the plant on all sides to allow light to reach the soil.",
    "For flowers, remove any shoots, gnarled roots, and dead leaves.",
    "Cut off flowers and shoots if your plant is struggling.",
    "For smaller plants, such as flowers, look for buds, blooms, and shoots in spring and summer.",
    "If your plant is fading or your region is experiencing a drought, removing these parts can save the plant.",
    "If your plant grows too large, you can always trim it this way.",
    "Shoots can often be planted elsewhere to grow another plant.",
    "Choosing and Introducing New Plants Choose plants that grow well in your region.",
    "Plants that are common in your region function best as landscape plants since they acclimate well to the weather and soil.",
    "Since they grow naturally, they also help your landscaping projects blend in with the surrounding environment.",
    "Search online to find which planting zone you are located in, as well as what plants are native to it.",
    "Native plants also provide habitats for birds and local pollinators.",
    "For example, in a warm area like California, you might grow drought-tolerant fruit trees and shrubs with few annuals.",
    "Check the shade in your planting area.",
    "Use the amount of shade available in your planting area to determine which plants you grow.",
    "Some plants need full sunlight to grow, while others do well in shade.",
    "Watch your yard throughout the day to see which areas are always sunny and which are overshadowed at least part of the day.",
    "For example, plants like azaleas and rhododendrons grow in spots sunlight reaches only a few hours a day.",
    "Some plants that require full sunlight are lavender and yarrow.",
    "Wait for a rainy day to see how well your yard drains.",
    "Delay planting until a storm passes through your area.",
    "After a few hours of steady rain, check which areas of the yard become swampy.",
