  "text":" Choosing a Liner Select a thermal liner if you'd like to insulate your windows. If your windows are drafty or thin, save on your heating and cooling costs by lining the curtains with a thermal fabric. The insulation will keep heat in your room during the winter while keeping out drafts from the window. It will also keep cool air from escaping during the summer months. Most thermal liners are made from cotton, polyester, or a blend. Buy blackout liners if you want to darken the room. Blackout lining is made from a thick, stiff fabric that will completely block light from passing through to your curtains. It's a good choice if you want privacy or want to block light in a room that gets lots of direct sunlight. Blackout curtains will also protect furniture and rugs from fading. Select water repellent or resistant lining. Consider the window that the curtains will hang in front of. If the window frequently has condensation, you should line the curtains with a water repellent or resistant lining. The liner will block the moisture before it has a chance to soak into your curtains and damage the fabric. Try using water repellent or resistant lining on kitchen or bathroom curtains since these are high humidity rooms. Pick a plain cotton lining to add weight to thin curtains. If you aren't concerned about blocking light or insulating a room, use a standard cotton liner. The weight of the liner can help weigh down light curtains so they hang better. The liner will also protect sheer curtains from sun damage. Check the materials of the plain lining since some may be made with polyester and cotton. The polyester will prevent the cotton from shrinking, if you'd need to wash the lining. Attaching the Liner to Header Tape Measure the length and width of the curtain. Lay your curtains flat on a clean surface. Use a measuring tape to measure from the bottom of the header tape near the top of your curtains down to the bottom edge of the curtains. Then measure how wide the curtains are across the bottom. Determine the measurements for the liner.

You'll need to remove the hems from the sides and tops of the curtains, but not the bottoms. Measure the length and width of the curtain. Place the curtains flat on a clean surface. Take a measuring tape and measure from the bottom to the top of your curtains. Then measure how wide the curtains are across the bottom. Cut the liner according to your measurements.

Fold the bottom of the liner and hem it in place. Lay the fabric liner in place on top of your curtain. Fold the bottom end of the fabric liner under by 2 in (5 cm). Pin it into place so you can easily sew the hem across the bottom of the curtain. Hem the sides of the curtain. Fold the sides of the curtain in towards the liner. You should be able to see where the old stitches were that you ripped out. Use your sewing machine to stitch along both sides to secure the liner into the curtain. Fold the top of the curtain over and hem it in place. Fold the top 2 in (5 cm) of the curtain over towards the liner at the top. Sew across the top of the curtain where the old seams had been.
