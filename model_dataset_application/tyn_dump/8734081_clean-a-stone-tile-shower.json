This will make it easier for you to find and target more severe buildup and hidden stains. Soft clothes will be the gentlest on the finish of your stone. Rough fabric, over time, could cause the surface of your stone to pit or cloud."

          "headline":"Scrub grout with a toothbrush and a mild detergent.",
          "description":"The narrow crevices between tiles and filled with grout are a prime location for buildup. Use a mild detergent, like dish soap, warm water, and a toothbrush to scrub the grouted cracks between tiles. Rinse the area thoroughly afterwards and repeat as necessary until the grout is clean. Because grout is often dirtier than the tile itself, clean the grout first to prevent it from spreading to the tile. Avoid using general grout cleaners when cleaning the grout of natural stone tile. These often have ingredients that can damage your stone. Stiff bristle brushes can harm the finish of your stone and cause scratches. Only use soft bristle brushes and soft cloths when cleaning."

          "headline":"Clean the stone with a mild detergent or stone soap.",
          "description":"Mix together warm water and a couple drops of mild detergent, like dish soap. Stir the solution to distribute the soap. Dip a soft rag into the solution, wring excess liquid from it, and use it to wipe down the tiles. Rinse the tiles frequently as you do so. Soaps that are formulated for the natural stone used in your shower can be found at most hardware stores. Cleaners that are acidic can damage your stone tile. Only use cleaners that are pH neutral (a 7 pH rating), which should be indicated on the cleaner's label information. Using more soap isn't always better. Too much soap in your solution could result in streaks or a film remaining on the tiles after cleaning."

Apply the solution to the tile with a clean, soft cloth. Using ammonia to clean your stone too frequently can negatively impact its appearance, causing it to dull.

To dissolve oil based stains, clean the area by gently wiping it with a soft cloth and a household detergent, like dish soap, or ammonia. Afterwards, dry the area with a soft towel. If detergent and ammonia fail to remove the stain, try mineral spirits or acetone. Use these sparingly and as a last resort. Flush these cleaners with water after applying, then dry the area."

Clean these areas as you would normally with 12% hydrogen peroxide and a couple of drops of ammonia. In some cases, you may be able to get rid of an organic stain just by removing its source. After removal, wait a few days to see if the stain disappears. Hydrogen peroxide may fade or lighten the color of your stone. Test it on an out of sight location before you use it.

Apply the paste to the stain so it is roughly \u00bc to \u00bd in (.64 to 1.3 cm) thick. The paste should extend beyond the stain by roughly an inch (2.5 cm). Tape plastic over the poultice, wait the time indicated on the label, then remove it according to its directions. For severe stains, you may have to reapply the poultice a few times before it is fully removed. Some stains may take five applications or more. Stain removing poultices can be purchased from your local hardware store or home center. Look for it among stone care products. Some kinds of poultice are sold as pre-made strips of treated paper. These are generally applied to stains similarly to paste poultices."
