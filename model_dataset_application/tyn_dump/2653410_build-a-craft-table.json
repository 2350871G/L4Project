Not only do they offer accessible built-in storage, they also tend to be just the right height to allow you to either sit or stand comfortably, which is useful if you spend a lot of time laboring at your craft table. Modular shelving units are available at all major furniture and home goods stores, and come in all different shapes and sizes. Look for a matching set that meets both your storage needs and style preferences.

Decide on a spacing that best suits your intended use.
