Use a sharp knife to carefully cut the links into 1-inch (2.5 cm) slices and put them into a Dutch oven or large soup pot. Chop two medium onions and add them to the pot. Cook the sausage and onions over medium heat until the sausage is cooked. Stir the sausage and onions frequently to prevent them from sticking. The sausage should no longer be pink in the center once it's finished cooking."

Cut 1 pound (453 g) of boneless skinless chicken breasts into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes and add them to the pan. Keep cooking the mixture until the chicken is completely cooked. You'll probably need to cook the chicken for about 8 to 10 minutes. If there's a lot of grease in the pan, consider draining it before you add the chicken."

You'll also need to stir in two (14.5 ounce or 428 ml) cans of chicken broth, two (14.5 ounce or 411 g) cans of diced tomatoes, 1 teaspoon of dried basil, and 1 teaspoon of dried oregano.
