Butter and flour give the gravy its thick, rich base. You can add more of both for a richer, thicker gravy, keeping the 2 cups of liquid the same, but keep the ratio of flour and butter equal."

  "text":" Making Basic Brown Gravy Measure out everything before beginning. If you have to leave something on the stove to measure an ingredient it could over-thicken or burn quickly. Have everything you need ready and measured ahead of time. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan. Melt the butter on medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Once it is completely liquified, move on. You'll be mixing the flour into the butter and you do not want any chunks, as this will lead to a lumpy gravy.

Either pour over meat slices directly before serving or pour into a small serving jug and place on the table for diners to serve themselves from. Making Gravy from Pan Drippings Measure out ingredients as your meat finishes roasting. The best gravy is made from pan drippings -- the juices and fats that come off the meat as it finishes roasting. This could be a beef roast, a chicken, or a turkey. When the meat has a few minutes to go, get your other ingredients out and ready to mix into your gravy:\n2 tablespoons flour or cornstarch\n2 cups pre-warmed liquid (chicken/beef/vegetable stock, water, milk)\nSalt and pepper to taste Remove the roast from the oven and set aside the meat. All roasts need to \"stand\" for 5-10 minutes before being cut up, so you have a little time to make your gravy. Tent the meat by placing foil loosely over the top and set it aside on a cutting board while you attend to the pan drippings. Strain the fat out from the liquid. Using a fine mesh sieve, separate the fat from the liquid. Save both. The fat will function just like the butter used for a basic gravy, mixing with the flour to form a roux. For quicker gravy, you can skip this step and simply heat up 2 tablespoons of drippings. However, the chunks of fat will lead to a lumpier, potentially less flavorful, gravy. Heat the fat on the stove on medium heat. They should still be warm, but this is especially important if you've moved the drippings to another pan. However, you can also just make the gravy in your roasting pan as well. Simply put the metal pan over two burners on the stove, add the fat back in, and heat up both burners. Deglaze the pan with a splash of cool liquid and a whisk. Use a splash of red wine, water, or stock and then scrape up any brown bits of meat and juice from the bottom of the pan. As soon as you add the liquid you'll likely get a loud sizzle, and you need to work quickly with a whisk or spatula to scrape up all the stuff on the bottom of the pan. Deglazing is when you use a cool liquid to clean a hot pan, removing the flavorful, caramelized bits and adding them to your sauce or gravy. Whisk in 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of flour, one at a time. Using a wire whisk, add the flour slowly with one hand while whisking with the other. You want to make a smooth, consistent sauce. Keep whisking until you've removed all the lumps.
