You do not need to insert the needle all the way through the fabric. You can just catch the fibers with the tip of the needle and then pull the thread through until it is taut. This is especially important if you want the thread to be hidden on the inside of the pants.

When you have finished stitching the button into place, take the tail of the thread still attached to the needle and loop it around the base of the button 2 times. Hold the thread and insert the needle through twice to make a knot. After the second loop hold onto the middle of the thread, and bring the needle around the base of the button to create a loop.
