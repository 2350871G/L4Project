Mesh bags allow air to circulate around all sides of the fruit, thereby minimizing the threat of mold. Strictly speaking, you do not need to place the fruit in a mesh bag when you store it as long as you keep it in the right part of your refrigerator. The bag keeps things tidy and prevents bruising and other similar damage, but you do not need to worry too much if you cannot find a mesh bag to use."

The humidity level inside the refrigerator's crisper drawer is different than it is inside the rest of your refrigerator. You may not be able to control the humidity, but if there is a control dial on the drawer, set it to \u201clow\u201d to help prevent the fruit from getting moldy."

Fruit that has gotten too soft or has begun to decay should be discarded, though. You should separate fruit that has already gotten overripe from fruit that is still fresh. Overripe fruit releases a gas that speeds ripening in other, nearby fruit, so your remaining clementines will spoil faster if you keep a rotten one mixed in with the rest of the bunch."

You need to maintain a little empty headspace because the contents of the container can swell as they freeze. If the container is too full, the frozen fruit and syrup could burst out, damaging the container and creating a mess in your freezer as it does.
