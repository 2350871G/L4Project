Discard the cap after you take it off. The bottom of the fruit has brown, raised ridges. The number of petals on the bottom of the fruit corresponds to the number of sections in the mangosteen.

Hold the fruit in one hand, then use the thumb or index finger of your other hand to press in on the indentation of the top of the mangosteen. You should feel the fruit give slightly.

Apply gentle pressure to the shell by squeezing it until it splits open. The shell of a mangosteen is about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick, but it starts to harden after the fruit is harvested. A very fresh mangosteen will be easy to split by squeezing it, but if it\u2019s been a while, the shell will be tough."

Then, twist and lift off the top of the shell. Don't cut all the way into the shell, because you'll damage the fruit."

          "description":"Either pick it out with your hands or use a small fork. The fruit should be opaque white, firm, and not translucent or yellowish. Large segments of mangosteen fruit usually contain a seed, so watch out for these while you\u2019re eating. Smaller segments are usually seedless. Mangosteen seeds are white when the fruit is fresh, but as the fruit ages, the seeds will start to turn brown, affecting the color of the fruit. You can use this to gauge the freshness of the mangosteen. Yellow sections of mangosteen flesh will be very bitter. Whole mangosteen can be stored at room temperature for several days. Once you cut open the shell, though, place any remaining fruit in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. Serving suggestions: Add mangosteen to sweet treats like jam and ice cream, or use the whole segments as a sweet salad topping!"
