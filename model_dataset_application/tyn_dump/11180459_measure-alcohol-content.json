Because alcohol is less dense than water, using a specialized hydrometer that is specifically designed and calibrated to measure alcohol content called an alcoholmeter allows you to measure the alcohol content of a liquid. Alcohol meters are used to measure the alcohol content of high-proof spirits. Check the packaging to make sure your alcoholmeter is calibrated for measuring alcohol content."
