          "description":"Work in a well-ventilated area so you don\u2019t breathe in any harmful fumes, and wear safety glasses and gloves to protect yourself. Dip a 2 in (5.1 cm) paintbrush with natural bristles into the finish stripper and paint it onto the wood that you\u2019re lightening. Make sure you get even coverage of the area so it can strip the wood completely. Leave the stripper on the surface for 20 minutes so it has time to set. If you\u2019re bleaching a wood floor, then you can apply chemical stripper or use a sander."

          "description":"Hold the scraper at a 45-degree angle to the piece of wood and apply a firm amount of pressure to lift up the old finish. Work along with the grain of the wood so you don\u2019t scratch it or leave noticeable marks on the wood. Continue scraping the wood surface until you remove all of the old finish. Set out a drop cloth under your workstation so you can easily collect all of the old finish and throw it away. Scraping your finish off may also remove some of the stain on the wood.Tip: Wet the wood and check if it changes color evenly. If there is a spot that\u2019s lighter or darker than the rest of the wood, there may still be some finish left on it."

          "description":"When you want to bleach your wood, you can either use oxalic acid for a mild treatment or a 2-part wood bleach solution for a stronger treatment. Wear your safety glasses and gloves when you mix the bleach so you don\u2019t get any irritation. If you\u2019re using oxalic acid, mix the crystals in water following the directions on the package. If you\u2019re using 2-part bleach, then pour equal amounts of both parts of the bleach in a small bowl and stir them together. Oxalic acid lightens the stain slightly and works best on naturally light woods. A 2-part bleach solution removes most of the color, and it also can lighten the natural color of dark wood. Both types of bleach will work on either oil-based or water-based stain. You can buy wood bleach and oxalic acid from hardware or home improvement stores."

Make sure you get a thin application across the entire surface of the wood so it lightens evenly. After you put the bleach on, let it set for about 30 minutes so it can change the color of the wood and stain.

    "Spread the stain on a scrap piece of wood that\u2019s the same type you plan on staining later, and rub it into the wood with a shop cloth.",
    "Wipe any excess stain off of the wood, and look at the color of the stain compared to the natural wood to see if you\u2019re happy with how light it is.",
    "The color when you first add the stain may be different than when it\u2019s completely dry.",
    "Let it sit overnight so you can see what the wood looks like once it\u2019s dry.Tip: Apply the original stain color on the wood next to the stain you already diluted.",
    "That way, you can directly compare them to see how much you\u2019ve lightened it.",
    "Mix in more natural stain if you want the color lighter.",
    "If you still want to make your stain lighter, add \u20442 cup (120 ml) of natural stain at a time and stir it together with your stir stick until it\u2019s thoroughly mixed.",
    "Test the color of the stain on your piece of scrap wood to see how it looks, and continue mixing if you need to.",
    "Otherwise, put the lid on the can so you can use it later.",
    "Keep track of how much natural stain you add so you can replicate the same color in the future.",
    "If your stain gets too light, add another \u20444\u2013\u20442 cup (59\u2013118 ml) of the original."
