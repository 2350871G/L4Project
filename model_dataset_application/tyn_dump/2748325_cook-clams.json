Mix the milk, water, and salt in a large bowl until well blended. Place the clams in this mixture and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours. As the clams soak, they should take in some of the moisture and flavor from the milk, water, and salt. If you are short on time, you can reduce the amount of soaking time to 20 or 30 minutes. This is not preferable, but you should still be able to coat and cook the clams. Mix the two flours and onion powder. Stir together the all-purpose flour, corn flour, and onion powder in a shallow dish until thoroughly blended. Do this near the end of the soaking time, immediately before you prepare to take the clams out of the refrigerator. Dredge the clams in the coating. Let each clam drain slightly as you pull it out from the milk mixture. Then, toss each clam into the flour mixture and dredge until all sides are coated. To drain the clams, simply hold each one above the bowl for roughly 30 seconds or until you no longer notice liquid dripping off. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b7\\/Cook-Clams-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Cook-Clams-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b7\\/Cook-Clams-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Cook-Clams-Step-10Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nYou can use your fingers or a pair of tongs to dredge the clams. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7c\\/Cook-Clams-Step-10Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-459px-Cook-Clams-Step-10Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/7c\\/Cook-Clams-Step-10Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-759px-Cook-Clams-Step-10Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Heat oil in a deep saucepan.

Grilling[3]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source\n\t\t\n[4]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Prepare and preheat the grill. Cover the grill grate with aluminum foil and pierce the foil with a knife to create holes. Let the grill heat to a medium-high temperature. By covering the grill grate with foil, you will be able to catch more of the clam juice that leaks out. The foil can be omitted if desired, however. If using a gas grill, preheat all the burners to a medium-high heat. If using a charcoal grill, spread a single layer of coals over the bottom of the grill. Light, and let the flames go until white ash begins to form on the top of the coals. Use oven mitts to reposition the grill rack so that it is 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) above the flames or coals. Arrange clams on the grill rack. Scatter the clams onto the grill rack in a single layer. Do not pile the clams into the rack in multiple layers. The top layers will not receive enough heat and the bottom layers will have too much weight on them to open. If necessary, cook the clams in batches. Grill the clams until the shells open. Cook the clams on the grill, without turning or flipping for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the clams as soon as their shells pop open. Discard any clams that refuse to open, as these have likely gone bad and are not safe to eat. As the clams pop open, they will release clam juice. Collect this juice, if possible, to serve alongside the clams. Serve hot. Pile the clams onto a serving platter and serve with clam juice, lemon wedges, and melted butter. Baking Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil. The aluminum foil is not absolutely necessary, but it will help to prevent the baking sheet from burning or becoming slimy. Soak the clams. Place the clams in a bucket and add enough water to cover them. Stir in the cornmeal and salt and let soak as the oven preheats. Soaking the clams in this manner should loosen the shells. Prepare the stuffing. Combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, lemon zest, pesto, parsley, and olive oil in a bowl. Add half of the clarified butter or melted unsalted butter and mix together until moist.
