The base should be smaller than the platform to keep you from stubbing your toes on the base when you get into bed. Gather your materials. In addition to the wood for your platform bed, you will need an assortment of tools and supplies, including painting or staining supplies. Build the base of the platform using either 2-by-8- or 2-by-10-foot boards. Consider things such as baseboard heaters, outlets and the thickness of your mattress when deciding how tall to build the platform. Cut the boards to the correct size for the base and arrange them on their edges in a rectangle. Measure and cut 2 or 3 crosspieces, depending on the size of the base, to fit inside the rectangle. Space the crosspieces at even intervals. Assemble the base using wood screws. Drill pilot holes for the screws in each board and apply carpenter's glue to the cut ends to help seal the joints. Use a carpenter's square to make sure all the boards meet at 90-degree angles. Place short pieces of board in the gaps between cross pieces and screw them in place to help stabilize the base. Stagger the pieces evenly. Allow time for the glue to dry. Cover the screw heads with wood putty, then paint or stain the outside of the base.
