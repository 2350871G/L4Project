Then, slice them into sections that are between 1/8th and 1/16th thick using a sharp kitchen knife, hand slicer or mandoline. Place the potato slices into a colander or strainer as you go. A single potato will be enough for a snack-sized portion. To have enough to share with others, use at least two large potatoes. You can peel the potatoes before slicing them, if you prefer. Peeling is recommended if you\u2019re using potatoes that aren\u2019t as fresh, as you can remove eyes, discoloration and spoiled spots this way."

The water may appear cloudy or dirty for the first few moments as dirt, starch and natural juices wash out of the potatoes. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear. Toss the potatoes in the colander to keep dirty water and sediment from becoming trapped at the bottom."

          "description":"Fill a large bowl with lukewarm water and drop in the rinsed potato slices. Give them 8-10 minutes to soak. This will help clean them more thoroughly while softening them up in preparation for cooking. Soaking the potato slices leeches out starch, which will make them cook up extra light and crispy. Having a higher water content will also make the potatoes less likely to scorch as they cook."

          "description":"Press the slices firmly between the layers to squeeze out excess moisture. There should be no visible water remaining on the outer surface of the slices. After drying the slices, lay them out side-by-side in even rows on the paper towels. Take care not to break the slices while you\u2019re drying them manually. Don\u2019t let the potatoes get too dry. This may make them unpredictable while cooking. A simple pat-and-press will do."

Dip the tip of a basting brush into the oil and spread a small amount over the outside of each slice until they glisten. The addition of oil will crisp and brown the potatoes similar to frying. Use an oil that has a high smoke point. Microwave heating is intense and direct, and can easily cause oils with low smoke points to burn."

Shake off excess oil before cooking the potatoes to keep from getting oversaturated."

Place as many slices as you can fit in a single layer onto a plate or platter lined with paper towels. Make sure that each slice is lying flat and you\u2019ve left a little space between them. Separating the slices will ensure that the heat will be distributed properly. Microwave the chips on a bacon tray to cook out excess oil and bring the calorie count down a little."

They should brown slightly around the edges when they start to crisp up. You may not notice much of a change of appearance after the initial heating. This will just start to cook the potato. Different microwaves heat differently. Depending on the intensity of your unit, your potato chips might not need a full 3 minutes at a time, or they may require a little longer.

Once the chips have begun to turn golden brown in the center, they\u2019ll have a delightful crunchy texture. Continue microwaving in 3 minute intervals at 50% power until the chips are fully cooked. Look for a consistent golden coloring throughout. Remove the chips from the heat before they burn or blacken. When cooked with convection heat such as a microwave, potato chips need to brown in order to be crispy. Don\u2019t be off-put by chips that come out a little darker, as this won\u2019t affect their flavor."
