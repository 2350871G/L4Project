For example, if you're making a pouch, fold over as much fabric as you'd like to make the opening. If you're putting snaps on a shirt, lay the front edge of the shirt over the opposite side so they overlap enough for you to add the snap. If your fabric won't stay in place, consider ironing it so it won't unfold or shift around while you work."
