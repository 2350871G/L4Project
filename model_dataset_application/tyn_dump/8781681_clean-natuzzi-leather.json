Then, dampen another cloth with plain water. Start rubbing at the outside of the stain and gradually work your way inward. Use another dry cloth to blot excess water until it's completely absorbed. Never dry your furniture with a hair dryer. Dry hot air will damage the leather."

Then, soak one of the cloths in diluted soap with a neutral pH (6.5-7.5). Begin gently rubbing the stain at the outer edge and work your way inward. Finally, dry the wet area with the other cloth. Continue blotting until all the moisture is absorbed. Don't use a hair dryer. Oil-based substances include oils, mayonnaise, chocolate, and ketchup."
