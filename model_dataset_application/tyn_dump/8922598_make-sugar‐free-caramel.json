Microwave the caramel and let it sit for 2 minutes. Heat the caramel in the microwave for one more minute. Leave it to sit in the microwave for 2 minutes. This will help the caramel set up and thicken. If the caramel doesn't look very thick after it's rested, you may need to microwave it for one more minute. Stir in coarse sea salt and vanilla.

Making Sugar Free Caramel Using Xylitol Combine the xylitol with agave nectar. Measure 1/2 cup (107 g) of xylitol into a small saucepan. Add 1 teaspoon of agave nectar and stir the mixture well. If you're looking for another natural sweetener, you could use honey or maple syrup instead of the agave nectar. Stir and cook the caramel for 5 minutes. Turn the heat on to medium and stir the mixture constantly. Cook the xylitol caramel until it turns golden. This should take about 5 minutes. Let the caramel cool before you use it. Avoid letting the caramel get very dark since the xylitol can burn easily. Consider thickening the caramel in the freezer. Since the xylitol caramel will be very thin, you may want to thicken it up if you'll be dipping something into it or you just want a thicker sauce. To thicken the caramel, put it in the freezer for several minutes. Store leftover caramel sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator.",
