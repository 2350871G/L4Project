      "description":"If you're making built-in bookcases, measure the space available, both at the bottom and the top- don't assume your walls are plumb and square. You will want to break up your shelving with vertical sections every 30\" or less- anything more and your shelving will sag. Use no more than 18\" to 24\" spans for typical 1\" wood. If they do start to sag, you can go back and cut small square 1\" side panels and mount them vertically in the shelf below for additional support. For built-in bookshelves, design a box to fit the space, and then plan for vertical sections and the shelves to fit into it. You can build it and then slide it into place and mount it."

      "description":"Remember most wood comes in 96\" sections, so you will have some waste. If you plan ahead how you're going to cut them, you can buy some shorter (72\") or longer (120\") sections to fit your design. Use poplar or maple over the low-end pine boards, since the knots make the wood hard to work with and paint."

Make sure to drill the holes perpendicular to the wood- use a drill press if you have one. A template to mark the holes is very helpful; If you're not tool-handy skip this step and you can use L-brackets to hold up the shelves later. It's ugly, but functional."
