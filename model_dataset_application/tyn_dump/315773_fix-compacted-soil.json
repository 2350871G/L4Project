Do this long enough to give the area a rest and consider protecting the area permanently by keeping paths, roads, or stock runs to restrict traffic to one area.

          "description":"If you use the compacted area for farming or gardening, move your plants somewhere else for at least one growing cycle. Instead, try substituting a cover crop at the end of the season, such as winter wheat or ryegrass. The roots break up the soil, and then next season you can mow and turn it in the soil with a spade or tiller to further aerate. A light, non-machine compaction can often be cured by letting the soil freeze and thaw through one growing cycle. Tillage radishes can help with severe compaction with their large roots, which work deep into the soil and leave space after they decay."

Dig small trenches behind these rows, then use the rows of soil to replace the dirt removed from the trenches. For poor soil, you may need to dig deeper, about two spade-lengths, to help aerate the top layer and mix it with better soil."

Run the tiller over the soil, then run it over again two or three times, using it to cut deeper. Tillers aren\u2019t as effective on large areas as coring machines since they only break up the top layer of soil.

Rent the machine from a home and garden store, then set the machine against moist soil. As it rolls across the soil it will pull out a core of dirt, then move it two or three inches away. Repeat throughout the area. Let the removed soil plugs dry before breaking and scattering them. Badly compacted areas require multiple passes of the aerating machine. Mark off any areas where pipes and roots run close to the surface. The aeration plugs should only be a couple of inches deep, but it can still damage these structures. There are also hand held aerators which you push into the soil manually and then move, which may be better for smaller lawns or gardens."

You can gather the soil into a planting mound nearby or bury it in good soil. Bring in new topsoil and spread it over the area. Check with your lawn and garden or home improvement store for a soil that has the qualities to nurture plant growth. The larger the plant, the more replacement soil it will need to flourish. Trees and shrubs require 15 inches to three feet of replacement soil."

Working with soil when it is too wet causes it to lose structure and collapse in on itself. Instead, wait until the soil is dry and crumbly.

These clumps are the pockets that give the soil the structure that permits air and water to penetrate it. It can be tempting to till the soil again and again, but this collapses the soil. Till the soil only before planting and during occasional aeration. Even consider trying no-till gardening or farming.

The organics are broken down by organisms such as earthworms that aerate the soil. For badly compacted soil, add a 50% compost blend to regular soil and 25% in sandier soils.
