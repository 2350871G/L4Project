          "description":"Car batteries contain corrosive acid, which can irritate your skin and eyes. Before you start, put on a pair of heavy-duty work gloves made of rubber, nitrile, or neoprene. These will also help protect you from possible electric shock. Wear goggles that can protect your eyes from splashes or sparks as you work with the battery and cables. It\u2019s also a good idea to wear clothing that covers your skin well, such as a long-sleeved shirt and long pants. Wear old clothes, since you\u2019ll probably get greasy and dirty during the cleaning process."

          "description":"When you work on a car battery, it\u2019s important to do so outside or in a well-ventilated carport. Car batteries release hydrogen gas, which can cause an explosion if it comes into contact with a spark in an enclosed space. Never smoke while working on a car battery. Make sure the ignition is off, since having your car on can also increase the risk of sparks or explosions."

Pull the latch or press the button to pop the hood. Use the metal bar located inside the engine compartment to prop open your hood. Car batteries are typically easy to spot. They are rectangular boxes, often black, and usually with a red cap over one of the terminals. Many of them feature prominent yellow or white warning labels. While most car batteries are located under the hood, some models have them in other locations, such as in the trunk or under the back seat. If you can\u2019t find your battery easily, consult the owner\u2019s manual for your car."

Lift the plastic cap to expose the terminal. Use a wrench to loosen the nut on the cable clamp and a terminal spreader to open up the cable terminals, if necessary. Terminal spreaders are particularly helpful for overly tightened or stubborn terminal clamps. If there\u2019s a lot of corrosive buildup, it might take some effort to work the cable connecter loose after you loosen the bolt. It can be helpful to pry it loose with a flathead screwdriver or prying tool. Always disconnect the negative cable, or ground clamp, first. This will prevent a dangerous short circuit.Warning: To prevent shocks and sparks, never leave your tools sitting on top of the battery."
