Position the vodka cap in the center of the watermelon. Use a serrated knife to \u201ctrace\u201d around the edges of the vodka cap, creating a circle. Stay as close to the actual cap size as possible, because you will eventually place your vodka bottle inside the hole that you\u2019ve carved, and you want the fit to be snug so there are no leaks."
