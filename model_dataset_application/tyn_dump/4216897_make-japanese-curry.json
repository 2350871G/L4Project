          "description":"Sprinkle the meat with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground black pepper, or season to taste. Set aside. If the meat is in one large chunk, cut it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes before seasoning it. You may also want to pat it dry with clean paper towels, as well. Curry can be prepared in the same way no matter which meat you choose (solid beef, pork, or chicken), but you might want to vary the spices according to your own personal tastes. For instance, many prefer to add more heat when preparing pork curry. You can do so by increasing the amount of pepper you use or by sprinkling chili pepper powder into the curry base before you prepare the roux. If you decide to make chicken curry, opt for dark meat portions of chicken, like the thigh. Take the skin off before you add the chicken to the stockpot. Alternatively, you can skip the meat altogether and prepare a vegetarian curry by following the rest of the steps as described."

          "description":"Pour the cooking oil into a large, heavy stockpot and heat it on medium over the stove. Give it a minute or so to warm up adequately. Note that you must use a heavy-bottomed stockpot with thick walls to avoid burning the curry. The stockpot should also be large enough to hold 5 L (5 qts). For a slightly richer taste, use butter or ghee instead of oil. Ultimately, however, the difference in taste might be difficult to distinguish since the flavor of the curry tends to overwhelm any subtle variations like this."

Temporarily remove them from the stockpot and place them on a nearby plate. If your stockpot is wide enough, you could just push the onion to one side instead of completely removing it. The important thing is to keep the cooked onion out of the way as you cook the meat."

Afterward, continue cooking for another 5 to 7 minutes, or until all sides have browned. Browning the meat ultimately adds more flavor to each bite. If you decided to leave the onions in the stockpot as you cook the meat, keep a close eye on them while the meat cooks. The onions can begin to brown and still taste fine, but if they shift from a dark tan to a dark brown, remove them immediately before they burn and blacken."

To save time, you can skip over the instructions for making your own curry roux and use premade commercial curry cubes, instead. You will need about 4 cubes, or 3.5 oz (100 g), to match the amount of curry roux used in this recipe. Add them to the curry when you would usually add the homemade roux. Do not melt the butter on a higher heat setting. Butter has a tendency to flash-boil once it reaches its smoking point. If you allow this to happen, you could cause the hot sizzling butter the splatter. The fat in the butter may also begin to break down, thereby affecting the flavor of the curry roux."

You must stir the roux constantly as it cooks, at least until the butter and flour fuse together and begin to swell. After that point, continue to stir the roux frequently. If you fail to stir the roux enough, it will burn quite quickly and develop a bad taste. The flour must be allowed to cook thoroughly in this manner.

Traditionally, Japanese curry is served in one of two ways: you can put the curry in a sauce boat and serve it with a separate dish of rice on the side, or you can put the rice on the plate and cover half of it with curry. Note that fukujinzuke is a sweet mixture of pickled vegetables and rakkyou are small pickled shallots. You can store extra curry by freezing it, if desired, but you should prepare the curry without potatoes if you intend to so do. Potatoes that are frozen and later thawed have a tendency to turn into unappetizing mush. Boil the potatoes separately and add them to the frozen curry after you reheat it. To freeze curry, ladle a serving's worth into a freezer-safe resealable plastic bag. Label the bag with its contents and the current date.
