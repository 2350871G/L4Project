Do this at least two weeks before you start your project to give it time to work and kill off all of the vegetation in the area. This will help to ensure that all of the plant material is dead down to the roots."

          "description":"If installing the lawn over soil, dig up the top 3 or 4 inches (7.5\u201310 centimeters) of sod to make room for the new base. You can use a small rototiller to help you dig up the lawn and break up the soil. Remove all existing grass and other plants, or they may create an uneven surface after they die. Let rain-soaked soil dry for a few days before you excavate, to prevent slumping. While the remaining surface doesn't need to be perfectly graded, walk over it or use a hand tamp to compact any obviously loose soil. A slight slope is recommended to improve drainage."

If you are installing the lawn over poorly-draining soil or a hard surface such as concrete, take the following precautions:\nIf there is no drain near the lawn, install a drainage system before you continue. If your area only experiences light rainfall, it may be enough to leave small drainage gaps every 6\" (15 cm) around the perimeter."

Make sure the border won't protrude above the grass level, or it may inhibit drainage."

This may also help deter gophers and earthworms from digging through your synthetic turf. Keep in mind that a geotextile barrier is a tightly woven, fairly heavy weed blocker. You can purchase one from an artificial turf supplier, at a true nursery or garden center, or from a landscape and irrigation supply business. A geotextile barrier is not the same thing as a weed blocker that you might buy from a home improvement store. You may install this over the base material instead. If you have a major rodent issue, consider a layer of rodent wire as well. Contact a professional rodent and pest control business for help to remove rodents. If left alone, rodents will wreak havoc on your artificial lawn."

You'll need approximately one cubic yard of material for every 100 square feet of lawn (0.82 cubic meters per 10 square meters). The information available for your specific product may provide a more accurate coverage estimate. If installing the lawn over concrete or another hard surface, a rubber shock pad or self-leveling compound can work instead. Alternatively, you can skip this step if you are certain the concrete has adequate slope for drainage and that you can completely cover the edge of the slab with the artificial grass. If children will be playing on the artificial lawn, then you may want to go with a shock pad for safety reasons."

Use a plate compactor, roller compactor, or hand tamp to compact the material into a sturdy base, reducing it to 90% or less of its original depth (a drop of about 0.3 inches / 7.5 mm). This will likely require several passes back and forth over the area. Go in different, overlapping directions on each pass for best compaction results. A vibratory plate compactor is the most effective option for this purpose. These tools are available from tool rental services. The hand tamp is the cheapest to purchase permanently."

Wait until the base dries, then make sure it is smooth and firm before you continue. If the base is not smooth, it needs more compaction. If the base ended up lower than expected, you may need to pour in and compact an additional layer, to ensure a fairly flat join between the artificial turf and surrounding surfaces."

Cover the seaming material with the accompanying adhesive product, then fold the strips back over the seaming material and let dry. Use the manufacturer's recommended adhesive only.

These are the most common options:\nWashed silica sand is used primarily as ballast to weigh the turf down. If your turf requires infill, sand alone may not be enough. Black crumb rubber provides the most cushioning and support for the grass blades. They may make a mess if the lawn is installed on a slope, or if pets use the lawn as a toilet.
