Gently toss the 3 ingredients together until the mulberries are evenly coated with butter and lemon juice. \u00bc cup (55 g) of butter is equal to about half a stick of a butter. Refer to the tablespoon marks printed on the wrapper. If the bowl is too small to toss the berries, you can gently stir the mixture with a rubber spatula. Be careful not to crush the berries.
