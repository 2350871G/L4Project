Vegetables need to be cooked at a high temperature to achieve the perfect tenderness and caramelization\u2014if the temperature is too low, the vegetables will overcook before they reach the desired browning. For roasting frozen vegetables, the oven should be heated to 450 degree Farenheit."

          "description":"While your veggies should all be around the same size once they\u2019re cut up, it\u2019s best to cut harder vegetables into smaller pieces than softer vegetables. This will ensure the vegetables cook more evenly, especially when they\u2019re all together in the same tray. Use a sharp cutting knife to cut the veggies into cubes or small pieces. Softer vegetables, like broccoli and cauliflower, can be in larger pieces than harder vegetables, such as potatoes."

Pour enough oil over the vegetables so that they all have a thin sheen to them; 1\u20133 tablespoons (15\u201344 ml) of oil should do the trick. Sprinkle any seasoning that you like over the veggies as well, such as salt, pepper, or fresh herbs and spices. Olive oil is the most common to use on vegetables, but you can also use toasted sesame oil, peanut oil or safflower oil."

If you put the veggies in a plastic bag with the oil and seasoning, seal the bag and gently shake it to coat the vegetables. While you want the vegetables to be well-coated in oil, they shouldn\u2019t be dripping."

Metal baking sheets will help the vegetables roast evenly, and a metal sheet with low sides is important so that any water can easily evaporate. The vegetables will need to have plenty of space so they roast evenly, so you may need to prepare more than one baking sheet if you\u2019re cooking lots of veggies."
