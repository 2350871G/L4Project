It should become crispy after about 10 minutes. Use tongs to place the bacon on a cutting board. Pour 1 tablespoon of the bacon drippings into a prep bowl and set it aside. If your bacon is very greasy, consider setting the fried bacon on a few paper towels before you chop it. The paper towels will absorb the excess grease."
