Refer to the manufacturer instructions for how to operate your particular iron if needed. Do not set your electric iron to the steam setting, as this will not effectively toast your bread."

Otherwise, the melted cheese won\u2019t stay inside your sandwich. For a classic grilled cheese sandwich, use 2 slices of a soft white bread. For a sandwich with an extra crunch, choose sliced ciabatta, multigrain, or sourdough bread. For a sandwich with a more earthy bite, use rye or pumpernickel bread."

Do not feel pressured to use the entire 1/2 tbsp (7.1 g) of butter, but make sure that the surface is completely coated. Otherwise, the bread will not brown properly under the heat of the iron. Instead of butter, consider using margarine or another butter substitute to coat the bread. Repeat this process with another 1/2 tbsp (7.1 g) of softened butter for your second slice of bread."

Refrain from using more than 2-3 slices of cheese, as the melted cheese will leak out of your sandwich and stick to the foil. Choose slices of American cheese for a classic grilled cheese sandwich or use slices of a sharp cheddar cheese for a stronger taste. Make your grilled cheese creamier by using slices of mozzarella or make it tangier by using Swiss cheese or provolone."

The heat from the sandwich will warm the additional components and cover them in delicious melted cheese. Place 1-2 slices of deli ham between American or Swiss cheese to give the sandwich a saltier taste. Add slices of tomato between pieces of mozzarella or provolone to contrast the creaminess of the cheese. Pair thin slices of apples with a sharp cheddar cheese to cut its bitterness and add a juicy sweetness to the sandwich."

Allow the weight of the iron to press down on your sandwich. Refrain from adding any additional pressure with your hand, as this may cause the cheese to squeeze out of your sandwich. Different iron brands can heat up at different temperatures. If you are worried that you may burn the bread, check on the sandwich after letting it cook for 2 minutes.
