Stand the squash upright on its wider end. Hold it from the top with one hand and use the other to run the vegetable peeler in vertical strokes down the side of the squash. Alternatively, you could hold the squash in one hand and use the vegetable peeler to remove the rind in horizontal strokes."

Cutting butternut squash can sometimes be difficult because the squash is dense and hard. If this is the case, gently tap the knife end with a rubber mallet to help it cut through the flesh of the squash. If the mallet method doesn't work, you can switch to a serrated knife and use a sawing motion to cut the squash in half."

For recipes like butternut squash chips, could run the peeled butternut squash over a mandolin to create super thin, even slices instead of slicing the squash using a knife."

          "headline":"Cut the lengthwise strips crosswise.",
          "description":"You could leave them as strips if you'd like, or cut them crosswise to create uniform butternut squash cubes. If you want to save some time with the cubing process, stack several lengthwise strips on top of each other and cut them at the same time. If you utilize this technique, don't let the strips slip while cutting. This will create uneven cubes. Keep in mind that the smaller you slice the squash, the more quickly the cubes will cook. Determine how small the pieces should be for the recipe you are using."
