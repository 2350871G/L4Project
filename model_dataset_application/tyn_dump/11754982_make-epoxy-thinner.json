          "description":"Fill a bowl or plastic container with enough warm water to submerge your epoxy bottles just below their caps. Set the bottles in the water and allow them to warm up so the epoxy and hardener flow and mix more easily. Leave the bottles alone for at least 15 minutes or until they feel warm to the touch. Make sure the epoxy containers are sealed completely so water can\u2019t get inside. Otherwise, it may have a cloudy appearance once it dries. Avoid using water over 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) since it could affect the color or appearance of the epoxy later on."

Thoroughly wipe the bottles down with a piece of paper towel until they\u2019re dry. Check that there isn\u2019t any water on or around the cap that could get into the bottle once you open it. If water mixes with your epoxy, it will cure with a cloudy finish."

          "description":"Read the instructions on the epoxy and hardener labels so you know the correct mixing ratios. Pour the epoxy resin into a disposable plastic cup or container before adding the recommended amount of the hardener. Mix the 2 components together with a stir stick until they\u2019re thoroughly combined. Different epoxies require specific mixing times in order to work properly, so always follow the instructions listed on the packaging. Avoid mixing any solvents or thinners with your epoxy since it will have a soft, gummy texture when it cures and it may not adhere as well to the surface.Warning: Once you mix the heated epoxy and hardener, use it immediately since it will start curing faster and may harden in the container."

Set the heat gun to the lowest heat so you don\u2019t accidentally burn the surface you\u2019re working with. Heating the surface works well on wood since it can help it become more porous. You can buy a heat gun from your local hardware store, but in a pinch, you can use a hair dryer on the highest heat setting as well."

Try to spread the epoxy over any areas you missed when you first poured it so it creates a thin, even layer. Get the epoxy as close to the edge as you can without it dripping down the sides. If the resin does drip over the sides, wipe it off with a paper towel. Most epoxies have a self-leveling agent so they usually flatten out as they cure, but using a foam brush will help speed up the process."

Move the heat gun back and forth over the surface so you don\u2019t overheat the epoxy. Allow the air bubbles to rise to the surface until the epoxy has a clear, shiny finish. Avoid holding the heat gun in one spot for too long since it could cause it to discolor once it cures. Your epoxy will finish curing completely within about 24 hours, but it will start to solidify within 1\u20132 hours."

If you\u2019re working with wood or concrete, opt for acetone since it\u2019s less likely to leave stains or discoloration. For plastic, glass, or metal, use denatured alcohol instead. You may also use an acetone-based nail polish remover if you need to.Warning: Acetone and denatured alcohol are both extremely flammable, so avoid working near a heat source or an open flame."

For example, if you\u2019re using 32 fluid ounces (950 ml) of epoxy, you can add up to 3.2\u20136.4 fluid ounces (95\u2013189 ml) of solvent.

After a day, touch the edge of the epoxy with your finger to see if it\u2019s solid or if it still feels wet. Typically, the epoxy will cure within the day but it may take longer due to the added solvent. The epoxy may never solidify completely.
