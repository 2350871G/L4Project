    "Look up at the tracks on the ceiling on either side of the garage door.",
    "Spot the springs on both sides that are stretched out and tense when the garage door is closed.",
    "Side-mounted springs are easier and safer to make adjustments to yourself than torsion springs and you don\u2019t need any special tools.",
    "Open the garage door all the way to release spring tension.",
    "Press the button on the opener, if the door has one, to open the garage door all the way.",
    "Lift the door all the way open with the handle if there is no opener.",
    "Adjustments to side-mounted springs must be made with the door fully open so that there is no tension on them.",
    "Use the emergency release cord to disconnect the opener, if the door has one.",
    "Grab the handle at the end of the cord.",
    "Pull it down and back towards the opener to release it.",
    "Even if the garage door is all the way open, the springs can still have some tension on them when connected to an opener.",
    "Using the emergency release cord will ensure that there is no tension on them before you make adjustments.",
    "Put a C-clamp on both tracks below the lowest door rollers.",
    "Loosen a C-clamp so that you can slip it over the track on 1 side of the door.",
    "Place it over the track just below the bottom-most roller, then tighten it as much as possible.",
    "Repeat this on the other side.",
    "This will ensure that the door stays open and there is no tension on the springs while you adjust them.",
    "Move both springs up by 1 hole for a garage door that is closing on its own.",
    "Unhook 1 of the springs from the hole in the bracket that holds it in place towards the back of the garage, then move it up to the next hole.",
    "Make the exact same adjustment to the spring on the other side.Tip: It\u2019s best to make adjustments 1 hole at a time, then test the door\u2019s balance after each adjustment to see if any further tweaks are required.",
    "This adds tension to the springs, which will balance a garage door that is sliding closed on its own or is hard to open.",
    "Adjust both springs down by 1 hole for a garage door that is opening on its own.",
    "Unhook 1 of the springs from the hole in the bracket that holds it in place towards the back of the garage, then move the hook up to the next hole.",
    "Repeat this for the spring on the other side.",
    "Lowering the springs will decrease the tension and balance a garage door that is sliding up on its own or slams closed too quickly.",
    "Replace both springs if 1 of them is broken.",
    "This only applies if your garage door is unbalanced because 1 of the side-mounted springs is broken.",
    "Purchase a new set of springs, then follow the same process for adjusting the springs, but replace them both with new ones instead.",
    "This will ensure that both of the springs have the same strength, as opposed to putting a brand new spring on one side and leaving an old spring with a potentially short lifespan on the other side.",
    "Remove the C-clamps from the tracks after you move the springs.",
    "Unclamp both the C-clamps from the garage door tracks and put them aside.",
    "This will allow you to close the door and see if your adjustments worked.",
    "If you need to make any more adjustments, remember to put the clamps back on with the door open before you move the springs again."
