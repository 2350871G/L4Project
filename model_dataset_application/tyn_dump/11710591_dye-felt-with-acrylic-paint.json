Then, place a few pieces of masking tape around the edges to hold the paper or plastic in place. Choose a work surface that can accommodate a large bowl or bucket and has plenty of space to spare so you can lay the felt pieces out flat to dry. Don\u2019t use newspaper for this. The wet felt will make the paper soggy and absorb the newspaper ink.Tip: If you're worried about staining the floor or carpet, consider covering the ground around your work space with plastic sheeting or garbage bags."

Acrylic paint can cause mild irritation if it gets on your skin, so don a pair of plastic gloves to protect your hands while you work. If you\u2019re working in a small, enclosed space, consider cracking a window for ventilation. Acrylic paint isn\u2019t toxic but you might not like the smell of it.

Fabric softener may cause the felt to repel paint, so it\u2019s important to omit it. Use plain white felt for the best results. If you use any other color, your results won\u2019t match the color of your dye bath. If you want to experiment, try using a pastel color instead of white. For example, dye pastel blue felt in a purple dye bath. The blue undertones on the felt may give your purple a deeper, richer look."

Start by adding a small, quick squirt of paint to the water. Stir the water vigorously with a wooden stick until the paint dissolves. If you want the color to be more vibrant, add another small squirt of paint to the bath and stir again until it dissolves. Create custom colors by using multiple paint colors in the dye bath. For example, you can easily create a unique shade of chartreuse by mixing green and yellow paint together in the dye bath until you achieve the desired shade. If you're experimenting with color, try mixing the colors together on a palette first. Once you create your desired shade, add the mixed paint to the water."

To get rid of any paint lumps, dunk a scrap piece of felt into the dye bath and swirl it around a few times to absorb them into the fabric. Then, remove and discard the felt. If you don\u2019t do this, the first piece of felt you try to dye in the bath will end up splotchy and uneven. Doing this also gives you a chance to see how your color looks on the felt and adjust the dye bath, if needed, to get your desired results."
