You can also have a small bite to test it. Serve the food to your party guests while it's warm. Keeping Soups and Sauces Warm with a Stove Turn the burner on at its lowest setting. After you've finished making your soup, you can keep it warm for a few hours by leaving it in the pot. Move the pot to a different hob on the stove and turn the burner on at the lowest setting. Put a cover on the pot while it's on the burner. By placing a cover on the pot, you'll keep the soup warm. The cover will stop most of the heat from escaping and this will ensure that the soup is heated more evenly throughout. If there's too much steam in the pot, tilt the cover at a slight angle to let it escape from the pot. Steam is also a sign that the burner is too hot. Turn the burner slightly down if you notice steam. Stir the soup at 5-minute intervals. While the stove is keeping the soup warm, it won't make sure that all of the soup is equally warm. By stirring the soup in the pot, you ensure that the soup is kept warm throughout. Take the soup off the burner when you're ready. Use oven gloves to lift the pot off the burner in case it's hot. Turn the burner off once you've removed the pot. Use a ladle to pour the soup into bowls from the pot. The soup is warm enough to serve if you can see steam rising from the surface. Using Other Implements Use the microwave to keep your food warm. While most people will associate the microwave with heating up food, and rightly so, you can also use it to keep your food warm. A microwave with a closed door is essentially a box that will trap heat. Place your food in the microwave and close the door to keep it warm. The microwave should only be used to keep food warm for 15 to 20 minutes. After this, the heat will escape, and the food will get cold. Put soups or sauces in a thermos. The thermos was designed for the specific purpose of keeping soup and other liquids warm for long periods of time. When you finish cooking the soup, use a ladle to pour it into your thermos straight away. The thermos will keep it warm for 4 to 5 hours. Place your food in a crock-pot. Crock-pots are also designed to trap heat and keep food warm. If you made potatoes or a stew, put them in the crock-pot and pop the lid on. The crock-pot can keep hot food warm for an hour or so. You can also put the crockpot in your oven to keep the food warm for hours. Heat your oven to 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C) to keep the food warm. On a gas oven, turn the dial to the first mark. Put food or bread in your toaster oven to keep it warm. You can use your toaster oven as a second oven to keep smaller dishes or bread warm. Heat the oven up to 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C) and put your food in it to keep it warm. Test the food regularly with a food thermometer to make sure it's above 140 \u00b0F (60 \u00b0C). If it's not, turn the heat up on the toaster oven. Cover freshly baked dishes with several sheets of foil. Foil is an insulator and if you wrap your food in several sheets of it as soon as it's finished, your food will stay warm for much longer. Wrap the sheets under a bowl or around the rim of a plate to keep the food on the container warm. Several sheets will do a better job than 1 sheet of foil by itself. Don't cover acidic foods with the foil as the aluminum will leech into the item. Put your food in a chafing dish to keep it warm for longer. Chafing dishes are a kind of stove, where fuel heats a pan of water which heats the food above it. If you're hosting a buffet, chafing dishes are the perfect items to display your food while also keeping it warm. Chafing dishes require small, portable, containers of fuel.
