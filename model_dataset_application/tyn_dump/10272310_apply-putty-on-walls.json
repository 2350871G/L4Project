To be safe, keep your mask and eyewear on when applying the putty as well. Additionally, the mixed wall putty may be a skin irritant, so it\u2019s best to wear gloves when applying it.

However, with older walls, use a paint scraper and/or coarse sandpaper (40-60 grit) to remove loose chips and flaking paint, primer or plaster. Use the sandpaper to also smooth out any bumps before proceeding. If there are smaller cracks or holes in the wall\u2014no more than about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) wide or deep\u2014use a screwdriver blade to scrape out any loose material.

If you\u2019re not sure, err on the side of mixing less now and making an additional batch later. Help keep the putty moist while working by draping a damp towel over the top of the bucket. Dry-mix putty is cement-based and great for indoor or outdoor applications on plaster and concrete walls.

    "With the putty loaded onto the large trowel, touch its blade to the bottom of the wall at about a 30 degree angle.",
    "Maintain this angle and scrape the blade straight up the wall while maintaining contact with it.",
    "Leave behind an even coat of putty that\u2019s about 0.125 in (0.32 cm) thick.",
    "Go from the bottom to the top of the wall in one motion.",
    "If you can\u2019t reach all the way up, go as high as you comfortably can and use a ladder to do the higher part of the wall later.",
    "Don\u2019t expect to master this maneuver right away.",
    "Your putty might go on too thick, or it may be to thin and have missing patches on the wall.",
    "If there\u2019s too much putty on the wall, scrape it all off and try again, this time applying more pressure to the blade.",
    "If there\u2019s not enough, go over the area again with lighter pressure on the blade.",
    "Reposition the putty on your blade, or add more.",
    "Once you\u2019ve applied a vertical stripe of putty on the wall, check the larger trowel blade.",
    "If it still has a sizable glob of putty on it, just use the small trowel to spread it out a bit if needed.",
    "Or, if you need more putty on the large blade, pick up some more with the small trowel.",
    "With practice, you\u2019ll be able to scrape the blades of your trowels quickly in order to add, remove, and reposition putty on them as needed.",
    "Keep scraping from bottom to top until you\u2019ve covered the wall.",
    "Move to the right or left of the vertical strip of putty you just applied, and place your trowel at the bottom of the wall again.",
    "Overlap the previous stripe of putty with about one-fourth of the width of your trowel blade (e.g., 3 in (7.6 cm) for a 12 in (30 cm) wide blade).",
    "Apply a new stripe of putty  in the same manner as the first one.",
    "Just keep adding putty to your trowel as needed and repeating these stripes until the entire wall is covered.",
    "If you have some tighter spaces to cover, switch to using the small trowel to apply the putty to the wall.",
    "Allow the putty to dry for 16-24 hours.",
    "Wall putty needs to dry thoroughly between coats, so it\u2019s best to leave it for a day before adding more putty (or doing anything else to the wall, like sanding or priming).",
    "In drier conditions, the putty may be dry in 16 hours, while it will take up to 24 hours in more humid conditions.",
    "To check for dryness, touch the putty with your fingers to feel for dampness, and look for darker areas that indicate remaining moisture.",
    "Adding a Second Coat and Finishing the Wall Apply the second coat either horizontally or vertically.",
    "There are differing opinions on the best way to add the second coat of putty.",
    "Some people prefer to apply it vertically again, just like the first time.",
    "Others apply it horizontally, in the belief that it results in a smoother overall surface and less sanding work afterward.",
    "In either case, you\u2019ll mix the putty, load it onto the trowels, and add it to the wall in the same thickness as the first coat.",
    "Horizontal application is really no different than vertical application, technique-wise.",
    "Keep the trowel blade at about a 30 degree angle and maintain contact straight across the wall.",
    "The second coat, like the first, should be no more than roughly 0.125 in (0.32 cm) thick.",
    "Sand and wipe down the putty after it dries for 16-24 hours.",
    "Once the second coat is fully applied and has dried thoroughly, go over the entire wall with fine sandpaper (300-400 grit).",
    "When you\u2019re finished, wipe off any remaining dust with a damp cloth or sponge.",
    "If you left some higher spots with your putty coats, sand these down with a coarse sandpaper (40-60 grit), then smooth them out with the fine sandpaper.",
    "Prime the whole wall, then add 2 coats of paint.",
    "Now that your wall putty job is finished, protect it with a coat of primer suited to the conditions (e.g., a primer made for exterior concrete walls).",
    "Add it to the wall with a paint roller and/or brushes, and let it dry as per the manufacturer instructions.",
    "Then, add 2 coats of paint in the same manner, allowing each coat to dry for the recommended time before proceeding.",
    "Even if you primed the whole wall before adding the putty, prime it again after applying the putty.",
    "This will add some protection to the putty and make the paint adhere much better."
