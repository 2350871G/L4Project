          "headline":"Choose comfortable and quality bed linen.",
          "description":"The bed linen should be warm, comfortable, and match the decorating style of the room. If the room is mostly neutral in colour, you could add in a colorful comforter and sheets which bring in brightness and zest. Colorful throw pillows for your bed are another option. You can easily move them to a chair or a dresser at night before you go to sleep. Keep in mind that you can change out your bedding to match the season. For example, you might stick to just a sheet and thin quilt during the summer. On the other hand, you can layer sheets and blankets during winter, adding a warm comforter on top!"

        {
          "headline":"Hang curtains or window shades which complement the room.",
          "description":"Curtains can either pop or blend in with the decor. If you have many patterns in the room, such as on the furniture or bedding, stick to solid-colored curtains. Patterned curtains work best if the other patterns in the room are minimal. Choosing blackout curtains will also help you to get the best night's sleep. These keep a room dark and cool in summer, and help to stop warm air from escaping through the windows in winter. Another option is to layer your window treatments either for style or to create a blackout effect. For example, you might put up Roman shades or grass cloth blinds and then hang curtains, as well."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Update the lighting in the bedroom.",
          "description":"Replace harsh, bright light bulbs with soft, low-wattage bulbs. Lampshades are also easy to change alongside the decor of the room, so consider a large, stylish lampshade for a statement piece, or a smaller, subtle one for a minimalist look. It's a good idea to add more lights than just your overhead light. For example, you might add a floor lamp and bedside lamp. This allows you to vary how bright the light is. During the day, you might use extra light to brighten up the room. At night, you might use just a lamp as you wind down for bed."

          "headline":"Place a rug near the bed.",
          "description":"A neutral shade for the rug means that it will last through changing colour schemes and patterns in the years to come. Not only will a rug add warmth and comfort, but it will also absorb sound which is especially important if you have creaky floors. A rug will also help to disguise and cover worn carpeting or flooring. Similarly, rugs can help your room stay warmer and quieter. You can also use a rug to add style to your room! A rug with a bold color or nice pattern can become a great focal point. Rugs also act as good dividers for rooms. If you are sharing a bedroom with your baby, or want to keep a workspace separate from a sleeping space, then a well placed rug will do the trick."

          "description":"Fluffy materials or faux fur add depth, warmth, and texture to bedrooms. Pillows or a throw added to the bed or a comfortable chair will make it much more cozy, and will have a luscious appearance. Lighter colors, such as whites and creams, for pillows and throws go with a wider variety of color schemes. Darker tones for these accessories have a warmer, more wintery feel. You can always change out your pillows and throw each season. For example, you might use Christmas themed items during winter, pastels during spring, whites during summer, and reds and oranges during fall."

Small bedrooms look best with lighter colours, as these can help to open up the space and make it appear larger."

A dark navy or indigo are both calming and fresh, and go well with a range of other colors, similar to a neutral tone. Paint, or subtly striped wallpaper are ideal for applying darker tones. Darker shades can make your room feel welcoming and inviting, but it's important to balance them with light neutral colors, such as beige, tan, or pale gray."

          "description":"Patterns with plenty of white allow the room to relax and breathe, and not using block colour in addition allows the overall effect to not be too overwhelming. Patterned wallpaper combined with a similarly colored patterned rug work well, as long as the bedding and furniture are a plain, neutral tone. A circular pattern on the wall works well with a striped rug, as the opposite patterns help to balance the room. Avoid using bright colors for your bold pattern. For example, red or bright pink stripes could be overwhelming, making it hard for you to relax at night."

Using a brightly colored cushion, throw, or bedding, can inject a splash of colour to break up the rustic tones. Plants also work well for brightening up clad walls, to add greenery into an already natural space."

Voluminous bedding in combination with neutral toned furniture will make the texture and comfort the focus of the room. Great options for adding texture include adding wall decor, placing baskets around the room, choosing bedding with different textures, and opting for ornate furniture. Bedding which is ruffled, bunched, or simply just not flat will work wonders for adding texture to a room. A monochrome approach uses texture rather than color to add life to a room, so using both may make the room seem crowded and overwhelming."

There are many forms of art to explore for decorating a bedroom. Photos, framed posters, prints, and paintings are just a few. You might also choose to display photos of your family, friends, and pets. This can be a comforting addition to your bedroom! If you want to hang several photos or pieces of art, create a gallery wall by clustering them on the same wall. When arranging multiple hanging art pieces on the wall, trace each piece onto paper first. Then you cut out each tracing, label it, and can stick it to the wall to try out every arrangement at ease."

For an empty corner or a wasted space, add a small cluster of potted plants of contrasting shapes, colours and sizes. You could also have a wall mounted plant in the bedroom for a unique and warm look."

To make the most of the morning light, try placing a mirror on the wall adjacent to the window. For capitalizing on the soft, afternoon light, put the mirror on the wall opposite to the window. To include a mirror where there is minimal wall space, try hanging it on the door. Choose a mirror which takes up as much of the door as possible, and use mirror clips to attach it securely. It's best to avoid hanging a mirror over your bed. Not only is it impractical because you can't use the mirror, it's also dangerous, as the mirror is heavy and could fall on you."

    "Include practical shelving.",
    "Shelves are great for displaying and organising books, trinkets, and accessories.",
    "Arrange all the necessary items on the shelving first, and then scatter a few decor pieces such as photos, small pot plants, or small artwork where you find room.",
    "There are many different forms of shelving to suit a range of bedroom types.",
    "Shelving above a window or the bed works best for displaying stylish or interesting items, while bookcase style shelving works best for storing items neatly.",
    "Use bedside tables for practicality.",
    "The surface of a bedside table is the perfect place for a statement lamp or a standout knick knack.",
    "The drawer is also useful to hide away bedside essentials.",
    "Many bedside tables come with a lower shelf, which is useful for storing books.",
    "Try not to add clutter to your bedside table.",
    "Instead, just keep the items you need for bedtime and/or the morning on it.",
    "Pick baskets for bedroom storage that are both functional and decorative.",
    "Baskets are useful for temporary storage, such as putting in throws or pillows from the bed when you are ready to sleep.",
    "This helps to make the room look neat in an instant.",
    "Wicker baskets in particular are both perfect for storing bedding and for being a main feature in a cozy, rustic bedroom."
