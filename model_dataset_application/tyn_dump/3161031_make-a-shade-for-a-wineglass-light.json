This will be your initial arc. Mark the long edge of a sheet sheet of paper at a point approximately 1/3 of its length. Legal paper works the best, but you can get by with an 8.5 x 11 (21.5 x 28cm) sheet of paper if you are careful. Place the protractor along the edge of the paper with its center over the mark made in the previous step.  Mark a 110 degree angle. Angle it away from the longer section toward the shorter, 1/3rd edge of the paper, forming an obtuse angle. Draw a line through the two points. Extend it to the opposite edge of the paper. Draw a dashed line 1/4 to 1/2 an inch (6.35mm to 1.27cm) beyond the first line. This will be the \"flap\" or \"lip\" used for taping or gluing the edges of your shade together. Use your compass with the measurement from the glass opening to draw an arc from the center point of your angle on the paper.  Determine the height you want the lampshade to be.
