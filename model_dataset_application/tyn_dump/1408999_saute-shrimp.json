Butter or oil will work fine, but be careful not to get the skillet too hot if you use butter, as it can burn. You can use any cooking oil you'd like, from olive oil or coconut oil to corn oil. Pick an oil that will add a little flavor. Watch for the oil or butter to move around the pan easily, as that indicates it's ready."
