To do this, you can install cement or fiber backing board. The rest of the waterproofing materials will be applied directly to this wall backing. If you use cement board, apply cement board tape to the joints, corners, and any other areas where the floor and walls of the shower meet. Another option is to put in green board, a type of drywall formulated to withstand moisture, mold, and mildew. It\u2019s only slightly more expensive than ordinary drywall and can be found at home improvement stores. Even though materials like concrete backing board are designed not to swell, split or mold when they come into contact with moisture, it\u2019s highly recommended that you take the time to treat them with liquid waterproofing to ensure that they\u2019ll last."

Cut the membrane into long, thin strips to fit the corners where the shower walls meet. Reinforcing membranes are typically made from tightly-woven fibers. When sandwiched between layers of liquid waterproofing, they\u2019ll provide an additional layer of water-stopping protection.

If you already have a shower head, faucet and knobs picked out, measure them around the base before you cut the slits so you don't have to make them any bigger than necessary.
