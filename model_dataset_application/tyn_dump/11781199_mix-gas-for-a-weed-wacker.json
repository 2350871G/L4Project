Different weed wacker models might have different suggested ratios, so always confirm the recommended ratio to keep your engine in good working order.The most common mixtures for small engines are 32:1, 40:1, 50:1, or 100:1. Currently, the most common mixtures are 50:1 and 40:1. If you don\u2019t have the user manual, try searching online for your weed wacker model and recommended oil mixture, or contact the manufacturer. When you learn the correct oil mixture, write it down somewhere or on the side of the machine so you don\u2019t forget."

Since weed wackers have small gas tanks, a 1 US gal (3.8 L) can should be plenty.1 US gal (3.8 L) is also a good amount because in the US, mixing oil usually comes in small bottles measured to a 50:1 mixture for a gallon of gas. This way, you can just pour in the whole bottle, unless you're using a different ratio. Only mix gas in a container meant to hold gasoline. If you\u2019re using an old container, clean off the area around the lid so no dirt or grime gets into your gasoline."

Just divide by 40 instead of 50. 128 fl. oz. is 3.2 fl. oz. if you divide it by 40. This means you need 3.2 fl. oz. of oil per gallon of gas for a 40:1 mixture.
