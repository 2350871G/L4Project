With the fan turned off and the blades still, clean any excess build-up off the top, sides, and bottom of the fan blades with your a household cleaner. Turn the fan back on and check for wobble.

With a screwdriver, tighten any screws that seem to be loose. Alternatively, at this point you can unscrew the fan blades and clean them further. Dust can build up in the gaps in between the blades and the flywheel, causing misalignment after a while.
