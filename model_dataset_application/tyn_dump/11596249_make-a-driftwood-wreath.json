Buy a roll of burlap that\u2019s 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) wide and set the end against one of the wires on the front of the wreath wring. Apply a line of hot glue to the end of the burlap and press it against the wire for 30 seconds so it sets.You can buy wreath rings and burlap online or from your local crafts store. Wire wreath rings come in many sizes, so you can make a small or large driftwood wreath."

Continue wrapping the burlap around the ring to ensure there aren\u2019t any visible wires or gaps.Put a line of glue every 3\u20134 times you go through the center of the ring to ensure the burlap doesn\u2019t come loose."

That way you can easily work from the largest to smallest pieces when you make your wreath.You can buy about 30\u201350 pieces of driftwood for around $10 USD.Tip: If you collect your own driftwood, be sure to clean it with a scrub brush or a bleach and water solution to kill any bacteria left on it."

Try to fit the pieces so they don\u2019t overhang over the sides of the ring, or else you could make it lose its circular shape.It\u2019s okay if you need to overlap some of the driftwood pieces on your first layer.

    "As the flowers dry out or wither, you can either leave them or replace them with fresh blooms.",
    "You can also buy fake succulent plants and glue them around the driftwood to add some greenery to your wreath.You can use artificial flowers as well if you want them to stay bright and colorful.",
    "Avoid keeping real succulents on the wreath since they require water and will rot otherwise.",
    "Wrap rope or fabric around the wreath to create a rustic feel.",
    "Look for thick pieces of rope or twine that contrast the color of your driftwood to add more visual interest.",
    "Coil the rope around the wreath so it goes through the hole in the middle, and wrap it as many times as you want.",
    "You can also use colored strips of fabric to add more decoration to the wreath.This is a great option if you want to change the decorations frequently since you don\u2019t have to glue anything down.",
    "Tie the fabric or rope into bows for added decorative features.Warning: Be careful not to wrap the pieces too tightly, or else the glue could break apart.",
    "Tie garlands and ribbons around the ring for a driftwood Christmas wreath.",
    "Look for real or artificial garlands to help contrast the colors of your driftwood and wrap them around the wreath.",
    "Run green and red ribbons alongside the garlands to add more festive colors to your wreath.",
    "Tie the ribbons into large bows on the front of your wreath so it looks like a present.You may be able to hang ornaments from the driftwood pieces, but they could fall off.",
    "Run string lights around the wreath if you want it lit up.",
    "Attach a mirror behind the wreath to create a decorative driftwood frame.",
    "Choose a circular mirror that\u2019s the same diameter as the inner circle of the wreath.",
    "Turn the wreath upside-down and position the mirror over the hole so the reflective surface is face-down.",
    "Use super glue or hot glue around the outer rim of the mirror and press it gently onto the driftwood.",
    "Allow the glue to set for 1\u20132 minutes before flipping the wreath over and hanging it.Opt for mirrors without a frame so it\u2019s easier to glue to the driftwood."
