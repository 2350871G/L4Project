Pillows and mattress toppers absorb a lot of sweat and dead skin cells when you are sleeping, so these should be washed every few weeks, depending on individual need."

          "description":"Washing your sheets, pillows, pillowcases, and mattress toppers with hot water in your washing machine and drying them on high heat will sanitize, deodorize and clean them. Depending on the size and materials of your bedding, you may need to take them to a laundromat or a dry cleaner. Review care instructions on the tags of the bedding to be sure. Many pillows are safe to wash in your washing machine. Check the tag on the pillow to find the instructions for cleaning it."

          "headline":"Deodorize the mattress by sprinkling baking soda all over it.",
          "description":"Baking soda does a great job at removing odors from fabrics. For a twin-sized mattress, sprinkle at least 1 cup (240 ml) of baking soda evenly all over it. If your mattress is bigger or smaller, you can adjust the quantity accordingly. A queen or king-sized mattress may require the whole box of baking soda. You can buy commercial scented deodorizing powders, but baking soda doesn\u2019t have all those chemical additives and works just as well. Mix in a few drops of essential oil to the baking soda before sprinkling it on if you\u2019d like to lightly perfume your mattress. Use peppermint, lavender, or eucalyptus to help deodorize and remove dust mites. Work a small amount of white vinegar or laundry detergent into the baking soda to help penetrate and remove any stains from your mattress."

          "headline":"Allow the baking soda to sit on the mattress for at least 1 hour.",
          "description":"Letting the baking soda sit gives it time to absorb oils and smells. If the mattress has a strong smell, like urine, you may want to let the baking soda sit longer to ensure all the smell is removed. If you can, allow the baking soda to sit for up to 24 hours for really tough smells."

          "headline":"Vacuum the mattress slowly and thoroughly with the hand attachment.",
          "description":"After the baking soda has had time to deodorize the mattress, run the vacuum hand attachment slowly in short strokes over the entire mattress. Hold the vacuum in place longer in areas of frequent contact with skin, like where you lay your head and your feet, to suck up all the dead skin cells and dust mites. You can use any hand attachment that came with your vacuum to clean your mattress, though a wide-mouth hose attachment with a rotating brush would work best. Vacuuming prior to steam cleaning is important because you want to remove as much dirt and loose fibers as you can so the steam cleaner can penetrate deep into the mattress."
