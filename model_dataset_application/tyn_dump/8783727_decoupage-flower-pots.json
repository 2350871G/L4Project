Wipe the entire pot, inside and out, with a damp sponge, then set it out to dry. If the pot has any rough edges, buff them away with some sandpaper. Be sure to wipe the pot down again when you are done."

          "description":"You can use the spray-on kind or the brush-on kind. Let each coat dry before applying the next one. How long it takes for each coat to dry depends on the type of sealant you are using. If you plan on putting a plant into the pot, it would be best to use an oil-based sealant. If you'll be using the pot as a decoration or to hold craft supplies, you can use a water-based sealant. The sealant is important, especially if you'll be adding a plant. It will keep moisture from sinking into the pot and causing the paint/glue to bubble."

Once again, let each coat of paint dry before applying the next one. Acrylic paint dries quickly, so you'll only have to wait 15 to 20 minutes between each coat. When you are done painting, let the pot dry completely. You can paint the pot any color you want, but something that matches the background of your paper will work the best."

If you can't find any paper that you like, cotton fabric is a great alternative. Choose something with shapes that are easy to cut out, such as birds or flowers. You can use any design you want to decorate it, but something nature-themed would look the best on a flower pot. How much paper you need depends on how big your pot is and how much of it you plan to cover up. You can cover your entire pot with paper, or you can add just a few designs on it."

This will give you a more rustic touch. It will also make it easier to overlap the edges if you plan on covering the entire pot. If you are using a seed packet, you could simply cut around the front image so that it's a square or rectangle. If you are tearing a napkin, outline your shapes with a clean, wet paintbrush first.
