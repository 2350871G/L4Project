Purchase 6 yards (5.5 m) of tulle fabric in the color of your choice. Try getting some black tulle to layer over a black dress. Or, use a contrasting color with your dress, such as hot pink tulle with a black dress or green tulle with a purple dress. Some types of tulle fabric have glitter or sequins on them. You can also find tulle in different textures, such as a heavy flat tulle, a lightweight airy tulle, or tulle that is crinkled. Opt for a heavier tulle to give your dress some volume and structure. Opt for a lightweight tulle for an airy overlay."

If you want to make an overlay with an elastic band, then choose an elastic that matches the color of the tulle, or that at least blends in. For example, if the tulle is red and you want to wear it over a black dress, get red elastic if possible. But if you cannot find red elastic, get black elastic so it will blend in with your dress."

If you prefer to secure the skirt with elastic, then purchase enough elastic to fit around your waist. You can use any color elastic for an underskirt. If you want to make an overlay with an elastic band, then choose an elastic that matches the color of the tulle, or that at least blends in. For example, if the tulle is red and you want to wear it over a black dress, get red elastic if possible. But if you cannot find red elastic, get black elastic so it will blend in with your dress.

Fold the tulle widthwise several times so that it is in a bundle. Then, cut a straight line across the marked area of the tulle. Use a sharp pair of scissors or a sharp rotary cutter on a cutting mat to cut the fabric. Measure and cut the ribbon.

Mark the ribbon where you need to cut it and then make the cut. Pleating and Sewing the Tulle Pleat and pin the edge of the skirt to create 3 in (7.6 cm) pleats.
