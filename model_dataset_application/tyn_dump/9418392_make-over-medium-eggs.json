Once the pan is preheated, it\u2019s important to oil it so the eggs don\u2019t stick. Spray the pan with nonstick cooking spray or add a pat of butter. If you\u2019re using butter, let it melt completely before adding the eggs. It should take 1 to 3 minutes for the butter to melt completely. Crack the egg into a small bowl. It\u2019s usually easier to add the egg to the pan if you break it into a bowl first. Use a small bowl, and be careful not to break the yolk. If you prefer, you can crack the egg directly into the pan. Cooking the First Side Pour the egg into the pan. When the pan is properly oiled, carefully drop the egg into the pan. Take care not to break the yolk, and season the egg lightly with salt and/or pepper if you like. Even if you\u2019re using a large skillet, it\u2019s best to cook just one egg at a time so the whites don\u2019t run together. Cook the egg until the underside sets.

It\u2019s best to use a thin spatula when you flip the eggs. Use a jiggling motion to slide it under the egg. Finishing the Egg Cook the egg on the other side to set. After you\u2019ve flipped the egg over, allow it to cook for another 2 minutes on the opposite side. This will set the yolk as well as the white on the other side. Turn off the heat and let the egg set for a minute. When the egg has cooked for another couple of minutes, shut off the stove.
