          "description":"Use a sanding block (and a lot of elbow grease) or an orbital sander to give each side of the boomerang an airfoil shape. The direction the airfoil faces depends on the hand with which you throw. First, mark the top of the boomerang. As with airplane wings, the airfoils on a boomerang have a leading and a trailing edge. The leading edge is a quarter-round shape and the trailing edge tapers off the top of the boomerang like the cross-section of a typical airplane wing. Mark the two leading edges and the two trailing edges so you do not file them incorrectly. The bottom face of the wing is completely flat. Lay out the leading and trailing edges of the wings based on which hand will do the throwing. A marking gauge can be used for this (or the old trick of holding a finger against the edge). Mark in on the top the distance that the contour retreats back from the boomerang\u2019s edge to its top surface. The quarter-round shape generally extends about 1/4\u2033 (6 mm) from the edge, while the trailing edge extends about 1\u2033 (2.5 cm) to 1 1/2\u2033 (3.8 cm) into the material. Note that you only have to shape one face of the plywood. The other face is left flat.The traditional Australian boomerang has positive dihedral (an angle formed by two plane faces). The best choice is to find a position in which the boomerang wings tips are up."

Either way, work with something similar to 8.5\" x 11\" (21.6 x 28 cm). Normal, run-of-the-mill paper is best. Cardboard or stock paper is unnecessary. Fold it in half, hot dog style (the long way). It's important to be as precise as possible. Make a firm crease along the top of the paper, fold it backwards along the same crease, and split it in half. Fold it in half again, the same way.

Your paper should now be as long as possible, right side unfolded, left side folded in. You'll see a diamond underneath the right fold. Make the creases of that diamond firm and distinct. Close the top half of the right side. Squash the diamond, folding the corner of the diamond up against the top right of the paper. You should now have a loose \"L\" shape. Fold the bottom left side into the pocket of the \"L\" shape. Fold down the left side. This should create a mountain shape where the two perpendicular lines meet. Take the right side and fold it down, forcing the mountain to the left. Take the bottom layer of the left side and lift it up. Place what was the top layer on the bottom, leaving the end (or pocket) open. Fold the end original bottom layer into the pocket, inverting the sides. You now have a very distinct L shape.
