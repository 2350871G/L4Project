          "description":"If you don\u2019t have a double boiler, you can make one out of a pot and a glass bowl. Fill the pot with about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water and place it on the stove. Place the glass bowl on top of the pot, and put the 3 tablespoons (30 grams) of white chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of milk into it. Turn the burner to medium-high, and stir the white chocolate chips and milk with a spatula as they begin to meld together. If you\u2019re using white chocolate sauce rather than chips, you don\u2019t need to worry about making a double boiler. The steam from the boiling water will heat the glass bowl and melt the chocolate chips\u2014this prevents the chocolate from burning!"
