Keep the measuring tape taut but not tight, and make sure that it remains parallel to the ground. The default instructions are for a small waist measuring 32 inches (81 cm), but necessary changes for medium/34-inch (86 cm), large/37-inch (94 cm), and extra-large/39-inch (99 cm) sizes are noted, where applicable, in the substeps."

For best results, use a worsted weight or light worsted weight yarn. Try a G-6 (4 mm) crochet hook. If the gauge is too large, switch to a smaller hook and test it again. If the gauge is too small, switch to a larger hook and check it again. Use the same yarn and hook for all three skirt parts (waistband, skirt body, and edging)."

    "Note that these instructions use the same yarn for both the skirt and the edging.",
    "For an easy variation, you could fasten off the yarn at the end of the skirt body and join a second color using a slip stitch.",
    "After joining the new color, follow this steps and all the others as instructed.",
    "Chain and single crochet once at the start of the next round.",
    "Chain one, then single crochet once into the first stitch of the previous round.",
    "Work one picot.",
    "Work four chain stitches.",
    "After the fourth chain, work one slip stitch into the first chain.",
    "This creates one bump or picot.",
    "For a smaller picot, only work three chains.",
    "For a larger picot, work five chains.",
    "Single crochet across the next four stitches.",
    "Work one single crochet into each of the next four stitches.",
    "Assuming you had 128 (small), 136 (medium), 144 (large), or 152 (extra-large) stitches at the end of your skirt body, you'll need to work one picot into every four stitches.",
    "If your final skirt body stitch count varied, change the edging pattern so that the picots will be spaced evenly apart around the bottom of the skirt.",
    "Work another picot.",
    "As before, work four chain stitches, then slip stitch into the first of these chains.",
    "If you used a different number of chains in your first picot, continue using that same number for this picot and each one that follows.",
    "Repeat all the way around.",
    "Single crochet once into each stitch.",
    "Work one picot into every four stitch.",
    "Continue this pattern until you reach the end of the round.",
    "At the end of the round, slip stitch the last single crochet together with the first.",
    "Fasten off.",
    "Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail.",
    "Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to tie off the yarn.",
    "Weave the remaining excess into the underside of the skirt.",
    "Weave a ribbon through the button holes.",
    "Slide a ribbon through the button holes in the waistband of the skirt.",
    "Use this ribbon to tie the skirt on when worn.",
    "To prevent the ribbon from fraying, clip the ends into a \"v\" shape and/or apply seam sealant to the ends.",
    "Alternatively, slide a belt through the button holes instead of the ribbon.",
    "Completing this step completes the project."
