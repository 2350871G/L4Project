This way, you can easily differentiate teams. Additionally, each team must have one goal board per team. Official Cornhole goal boards are 2 by 4 feet (0.61 by 1.22 m), with a hole 6 inches (15.24 cm) wide centered 9 inches (22.9 cm) from the top of the board. Larger or smaller boards might not work as well. Bean bags larger or smaller than 6 inches by 6 inches (15.24 cm by 15.24 cm) may make the game too difficult or too easy.

All throws should be made from behind the front of the board in an imaginary 3-foot ( .91 m) wide pitcher's box that extends the entire length of both sides of the board.

Low arc tosses generally have more horizontal speed, resulting in more forward momentum. This can help your bag slide up the goal board into the hole.

As you release the bag, allow your index and middle fingers to stay in contact with the bag slightly longer than the others to help generate spin. You must use an underhanded release in Cornhole.
