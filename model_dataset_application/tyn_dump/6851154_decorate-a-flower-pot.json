          "description":"No matter what material your flower pot is made from, make sure the areas you want to paint are clean. Use soap and water if there is any lingering dirt or dust. A spotless surface will help your painting last. Remove any stickers or price tags. If you\u2019re painting a terracotta pot, soak it in water for a few hours first. Scrub the entire thing with a stiff brush to get rid of dust or dirt. Wait 24 hours before painting, as terracotta is porous and will stay wet for a long time. Allow your flower pot to dry completely before painting."

          "headline":"Choose acrylic paints in the colors of your choice.",
          "description":"The color possibilities are pretty much endless, but make sure you use acrylic paints. Acrylic dries extremely quickly and is water-resistant when dry. It works on terracotta, clay, plastic, and ceramic. Use spray paint or liquid paint, as long as it's acrylic. Spray paint is a faster option, but liquid will allow you to use brushes and get a detailed design. If your planter will be staying outside, you can use an outdoor paint meant for withstanding weather."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Plan out your design.",
          "description":"Take a look at your pot and decide what look you're going for. If your planter is going to be inside, think about what might look good with the color of your walls or floor. If it's going to be outside, think about what colors might pop in your yard or garden. Use tape to segment off sections if you only want to paint certain parts. Add words to label herb plants to offer little motivational phrases. A pure white flower pot is a sleek, modern option. Use stencils to creative intricate shapes."

          "description":"There are no limits to what you can paint onto your flower pots, so let your creative juices flow! Use a large foam brush to put down a base coat. Choose a single color so you have a simple canvas to decorate further. Put down newspaper or towels and wear clothes you don\u2019t mind getting dirty. If you want to leave half of your pot unpainted, tape off that section."

        },
        {
          "headline":"Apply a clear sealer once your design is dry.",
          "description":"When you\u2019re happy with your new piece of art, it\u2019s time to make sure everything stays in place. To prevent fading or chipping, apply at least two layers of clear, water based acrylic sealer. Get an acrylic sealer from your local craft store. It may take a few days for the paint to dry if you used several coats of paint. Using spray sealer is recommended, but you can also get cans of varnish and paint in on. This might leave brushstrokes behind. Choose a matte or shiny finish depending on what you like. Once protected, a painted design can last for years!"
