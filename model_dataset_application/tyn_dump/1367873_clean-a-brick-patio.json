Ask a store employee to recommend a model that will work best on your brick patio. If you have the money to invest, consider buying your own pressure washer. Opt for a gasoline-powered pressure washer over an electric model, which will mean dealing with electrical connections that need to be kept dry and out of the way during cleaning."

Anticipate getting wet during the cleaning process and dress accordingly, in old clothing that you don\u2019t mind getting soaked.

Always test the least powerful nozzle first, then move to a stronger nozzle if you wish. Gas-powered machines will have a stronger spray than electric ones."

If there is a buildup of mildew, grime, or other residue, add detergent to the machine. Apply a gentle stream of soapy water to the patio using a low pressure nozzle, then let it sit for 5-10 minutes to penetrate dirt. Only use detergent that is specified for pressure washer use. A narrow nozzle will provide a high pressure spray while a wider nozzle will have a lower pressure."

Spray in gentle, consistent strokes to avoid leaving stripe markings on the patio."
