If the tip of the screwdriver sinks into any major support joists or posts, then you will need to get a deck building contractor to do some major renovations or you can rebuild the deck yourself."

Nail or screw the ends of the new joist to the ledger board by putting 2 nails or screws in at an angle. The ledger board is the board at the edge of the deck to which the joists are fastened.

However, make sure you use the same size of boards as the ones that you removed. Try to match the wood type and color to the existing boards.
