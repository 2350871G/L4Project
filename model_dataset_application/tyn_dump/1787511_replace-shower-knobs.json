Turn the shower on to drain out any residual water once you have turned the water supply off. This prevents you from getting accidentally soaked if you turn the handle while you are replacing it. The main water supply can usually be found in your basement or outside. If the main water supply handle is a wheel, switch it off by turning it clockwise for 2 full turns. For main water supply handles that are levers, turn the lever 1/4 until it's at a right angle to the pipe. It will stop being able to be turned at this point."
