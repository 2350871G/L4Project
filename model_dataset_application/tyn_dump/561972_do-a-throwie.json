It\u2019s easier to practice writing your bubble letters individually before you create them all smashed together in typical throwie style. Throwies usually spell out some version of the artist\u2019s name, nickname, or initials in 3-4 letters, but you can make your throwie spell out anything you like with any number of letters you prefer."

Erase any excess pencil lines after this.

Try to fill in each letter fully, but also stay inside the lines. Choose a lighter fill color that stands apart from your outline color and 3D shading\u2014for example, black outline and 3D and white fill, or dark blue outline, medium blue 3D, and yellow fill. Feel free to switch things up and color vertically (with an up-and-down motion), but the throwie will likely look better if you are consistent and color all the letters either horizontally or vertically."

For example, you could use dark blue for the outline, white for the letter fill, light blue for the 3D shading, and gray for the space between the inner and outer outlines. You can also use your main outline color to create a few small curved lines on and beyond the bubble letters to give the impression that they\u2019re expanding and about to burst."

  "text":" Creating Your Bubble Letters Write your chosen set of letters in pencil on a blank sheet of paper. If, for instance, you want your throwie to read \u201cOMG,\u201d simply write the 3 letters in standard form on an unlined sheet of paper. Place them at least 3 letter spaces apart (e.g., \u201cO---M---G\u201d) at this point so you\u2019ll have room to create the \u201cbubble\u201d effect around each letter individually. It\u2019s easier to practice writing your bubble letters individually before you create them all smashed together in typical throwie style. Throwies usually spell out some version of the artist\u2019s name, nickname, or initials in 3-4 letters, but you can make your throwie spell out anything you like with any number of letters you prefer. Create a \u201cbubble\u201d outline around each letter. Essentially, you need to make each letter fatter and rounded off. This is easy to do with an \u201cO,\u201d but letters like \u201cM\u201d require you to round off several straight lines and sharp angles. Practice several times until you find the look you desire for each letter. You may want to practice creating an entire bubble alphabet so you can create different names or words in throwie style. Squeeze the letters together and let the bubble outlines overlap. Once each individual bubble letter looks right, start over with the letters closer together. Write (for example) \u201cOMG\u201d in standard form with only a single letter space between each letter (\u201cO-M-G\u201d). Then create your bubble letters around each, allowing them to overlap. This squashed together look is a key component of a typical throwie. Darken the overall outline and erase overlapping lines. Use a dark pen or marker to outline the entire perimeter of the smashed together letters, along with any interior elements (like the hole in the middle of \u201cO\u201d). Decide how you want your letters to overlap (for instance, \u201cO\u201d overlapping \u201cM\u201d overlapping \u201cG\u201d) and darken those interior lines accordingly. Erase any excess pencil lines after this. Once you\u2019ve practiced creating your throwie many times, you\u2019ll be able to skip using the pencil and go straight to making the darker outline and interior overlaps. This is also how you\u2019d start with a can of spray paint on a wall. Adding Shading and Detail to Your Throwie Thicken the outline towards one corner for a 3D effect. A typical throwie tends to have heavier shading along part of the outline in order to give it the appearance of depth. You might, for instance, thicken the outline towards the bottom left corner of \u201cOMG\u201d in order to create this 3D effect. You can also thicken the outline along the entire top or bottom, or on either side, but don\u2019t thicken both sides or both top and bottom. This will ruin the 3D effect. Outline the entire throwie with another dark line. Beyond the dark outline of your bubble letters, trace a second outline that follows the same curving path. This second outline doesn\u2019t outline the individual letters, but rather the entire grouping (e.g., \u201cOMG\u201d) altogether, and helps your throwie \u201cpop\u201d off the page (or wall).

Feel free to switch things up and color vertically (with an up-and-down motion), but the throwie will likely look better if you are consistent and color all the letters either horizontally or vertically. Add more outline coloring or other personal touches. If you want to color in the space between your inner and outer outlines, choose a color that complements the others you've used.

You can also use your main outline color to create a few small curved lines on and beyond the bubble letters to give the impression that they\u2019re expanding and about to burst. Reproducing Your Throwie with a Stencil Draw the outline of your throwie on a thin sheet of cardboard. You only really need to draw the \u201cinner\u201d outline of your throwie at this point, but you can draw the entire throwie for practice if desired. Make it whatever size you\u2019d like your reproducible throwie stencil to be.
