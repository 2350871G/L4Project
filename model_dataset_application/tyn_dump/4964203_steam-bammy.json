The peel of the cassava is very thick and covered in a wax-like coating, so you won't be able to use a vegetable peeler to remove it. When using fresh cassava, make sure that you use the sweet variety usually sold in a market, not the bitter variety. Cassava contains toxic substances. In sweet cassava, those substances are concentrated in the peel. In bitter cassava, those substances are evenly spread throughout the flesh, as well. After handling the cassava peel, make sure that you wash your hands with soap and water. Rinse the peeled cassava under running water, as well."
