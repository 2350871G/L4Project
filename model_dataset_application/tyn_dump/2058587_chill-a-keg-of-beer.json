      "description":"To chill a keg, you will need a large, durable container into which the keg will fit with a little room surrounding it. The best option is buying a specialized keg tub, which can be found at many liquor stores and home brewing supply stores. Another ideal container is a large trash can. Most high-capacity outdoor trash cans can easily fit a keg of beer inside with room to spare. A third option is placing the keg of beer directly into a bathtub in your home. This will prevent you from having to procure a separate container, but will of course require your guests to fill their beer glasses from your bathroom."

Lower it as gently as possible onto the layer of ice in the keg tub. Moving the keg around too much can cause the beer to be too foamy when dispensed."
