You can get the same look by repurposing an old belt or by using some gold ribbon to create the appearance of gold rings. Choose a belt or ribbon that appeals to you. Make sure that the belt is long enough to fit around your neck at least 3 times or use multiple belts. Otherwise, you won't have enough material to create your choker. Also, cut off the portion of the belt that has holes punched in it or that has a buckle attached to it. If you use ribbon, get enough ribbon to fit around your neck at least 3 times. Opt for ribbon or a belt that is about 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) wide."

For example, if your neck width is 3 inches (7.6 cm) and your neck circumference is 13 inches (33 cm), then you would cut the fabric to 3 by 17 inches (7.6 by 43.2 cm)."

You will probably only have room for 4 or 5 strips, but you can use as many as you can fit onto the fabric, and you can cut the excess black fabric if you do not have enough strips to cover it. To check and see if you have the right number of strips to cover your fabric, lay them out side-by-side on the piece of black fabric you cut. To ensure that all of the strips are the same length, you can cut 1 strip and then cut the others so that they are the same length as the first 1."

Then, place the first strip of belt or ribbon over the top of the glue and press it down from end to end. The long edge of the first strip should be flush with the long edge of the black fabric. Center the ribbon strips on the black fabric. If you are using hot glue, make sure to give the hot glue gun enough time to heat up. This takes about 5 to 10 minutes. Then, you will need to work quickly by applying the strips to the hot glue right away or the glue will harden before you can attach the strips.

If you do not have enough strips to cover the fabric, you can cut off the excess fabric when you have used all the strips you have. Adding the Velcro Closure Fold over the excess fabric on the end and glue it into place. Take the excess fabric that extends past the gold strips and fold it over 1 time. Fold the fabric in towards the gold strips so that the edge of the fabric is flush with the ends of the gold strips. Apply some glue between the folded fabric and press it down to secure it.
