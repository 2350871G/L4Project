  "text":" Using the Tab Place the index finger of your dominant hand under the tab\u2019s ring. This is the upper portion of the tab with a hollowed out center, closest to the edge of the can. Your finger goes behind the top of the tab. The opposite end of the tab will be more in the center, and it will be the end to physically open the indentation. If you can't get your finger under the tab, use a butter knife or other flat object to pry the tab up. Rest your thumb on top of the tab to maintain your grip. Using the same dominant hand, put your thumb on the very center of the can. This should be on the bottom of the tab, helping to direct it. Hold the can with your other hand to keep it in place. This is super important so that you don\u2019t end up spilling the drink everywhere. Grasp the side of the can so that the tab is facing you, making it easier for you to open it. Hold the can on a stable surface to avoid spilling it. Lift the backside of the tab using your thumb and index finger. Your thumb will be pressing down on the can while your index finger lifts up the back of the tab. You\u2019ll feel resistance, but keep lifting the tab up until you pierce the opening of the can.

Once you\u2019ve lifted the tab completely, the hole in the can should be open and the tab will be vertical.
