First, blanch the greens in boiling water for a minute or two, then cool in an ice-water bath for the same amount of time. Drain the bath and squeeze the water out of the spinach by twisting it in your hands. Take about a handful and form the wet spinach into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic wrap, storing them in a large freezer bag. Freeze the spinach balls, and defrost for a ready-to-use serving of greens. If you use your spinach within six months, you can also freeze the spinach without blanching. This leads to a slimy product and is best used in dishes when cooking or baking. You can also wring the water, then place the spinach into freezer bags instead of making them into balls. Use a straw to suck out all the air or vacuum seal to prevent freezer burn."
