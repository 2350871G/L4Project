          "description":"Use a measuring tape to measure the length and width of your floor. Multiply these numbers together to determine the square footage of your floor. For oddly shaped sections of your floor, measure the area separately in smaller sections that are easier to manage. Then, add all of your sections together to determine the overall square footage. For example, if one section of your floor is 80 square feet (8.9 sq yd), and another section of your floor is 22 square feet (2.4 sq yd), you need at least 102 square feet (11.3 sq yd) of flooring."
        },

          "headline":"Order more than enough bamboo flooring to cover your floor entirely.",
          "description":"Buy roughly 15-20% more flooring than you need to ensure that you have backup boards in the event that you make a mistake or accidentally break a few boards. Bamboo flooring comes in a variety of stains and colors, so choose a flooring that fits your personal preference. For example, if you\u2019re covering 102 square feet (11.3 sq yd) of flooring, buy roughly 125 square feet (13.9 sq yd) of bamboo. If you can, purchase planks that are pre-cut into different sizes to avoid the need for cutting pieces to different sizes."

          "headline":"Remove your old flooring if you already have a floor installed.",
          "description":"Put on a set of thick work boots and a strong pair of work gloves. If you have hardwood floors, use a pry bar to rip the individual boards out of the floor. If you have carpet, use a utility knife to cut a corner up and pry the rest of it up by using a pry bar or pulling it up by hand. Use a nail remove to pry out any remaining nails that are sticking out of your floor. If your subfloor is already exposed, go ahead and skip this step. If your flooring is laminated, use a utility knife to cut a seam in the flooring and peel it up by hand. Laminate flooring is typically quite easy to pull up once you\u2019ve cut it. Watch out for nails or screws that are sticking out of your floor. Remove them as you work to avoid cutting your feet. This is a pretty tough process and it can easily take 6-12 hours on its own depending on your stamina and the stubbornness of your flooring."

          "headline":"Clean the subfloor thoroughly with a vacuum and damp cloth.",
          "description":"Discard your old flooring, nails, or screws. Scrape away any old adhesive with a floor sander or a putty knife. Then, sweep and vacuum your flooring thoroughly. Wipe any dust or glue residue with a damp cloth and let your flooring air dry for 12-24 hours.Tip: If your subfloor is made of concrete, pour a little water on it after cleaning the subfloor. If the water soaks into the concrete, you have nothing to worry about. If the water beads up though, you have a sealant on the concrete and the glue won\u2019t bond with it. Rent a floor sander and run it over your flooring to wear away this sealant. If there is any dirt or residue on your floor when you install the floorboards, the flooring glue may not grip the subfloor correctly and your bamboo may come loose over time."

          "description":"The bamboo flooring will expand, shrink, and bend slightly as it acclimates to the humidity and temperature in your home. To avoid this, unpack your floorboards once they arrive. Layer them on top of one another in a sequence of parallel stacks like you\u2019re building a log cabin. Keep the temperature in your home at 60\u201380 \u00b0F (16\u201327 \u00b0C) for the 3 days you\u2019re acclimating the bamboo. Do this in the room where you\u2019re going to install them and leave them out for 72 hours to let them acclimate to your room. This step is more important than it probably sounds. Your bamboo boards will not sit flat if you install them without acclimating them first."

          "headline":"Cut your floorboards into random lengths if they aren\u2019t pre-cut.",
          "description":"To avoid a uniform floor where all of the seams are on the same plane, cut your boards into random lengths using a circular or miter saw. Set your boards up on sawhorses and put on protective eyewear, a dust mask, and gloves. Turn your saw on and cut through each board at a 90-degree angle to make straight cuts.Tip: It may be tempting to be more methodical about this, but even if you do measure out specific planks and determine where they belong ahead of time, it will be exceptionally difficult to keep track of where each piece goes. Your spacers will also mess with your design and make it hard to fit each piece together. Most floorboards are between 4\u20138 feet (1.2\u20132.4 m) in length, but you can cut them in any pattern you want. Do this outside to avoid leaving sawdust all over your subfloor. You\u2019ll cut smaller pieces later to fill in small gaps between boards as you lay them. You can use a table saw if you prefer."

The thickness of these spacers should be identical to the thickness of your boards. In most cases, this will be 0.5\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm). Put 1 spacer every 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) to ensure that there\u2019s an even gap between the wall and the bamboo boards. As time passes and the bamboo absorbs moisture, the floorboards will expand. The spacers will leave an expansion gap around the wall and ensure that your boards don\u2019t buckle or break when they expand."

Spread the glue out by dragging your trowel over the adhesive at a 45-degree angle while pressing it into the subfloor. Spread the adhesive out across a small rectangular section of the floor. Work in a serpentine pattern and address lumpy areas by covering every section 2-3 times. The glue should be evenly spread out across the section that you\u2019re working. There should be no obvious pools of glue and every section should have the parallel marks from the teeth of your trowel. You\u2019re going to work in small sections by pouring glue, spreading it out, and adding your boards. The size of your sections is entirely up to you. Working in 2\u20133 by 8 feet (0.61\u20130.91 by 2.44 m) sections is a good average working pace.

Press it gently against the spacers to ensure that your board is flush against the wall. Then, push directly down on the floorboard to push the glue into the subfloor and the bottom of the board.Warning: Avoid sliding your floor boards into place. If your floorboard slides on the glue, you\u2019ll move the adhesive around and may end up uneven boards. It\u2019s okay if you slide a board 0.25\u20131 in (0.64\u20132.54 cm) when you\u2019re installing it against a wall, though. Don\u2019t step on your glue while doing this. Kneel in front of the glue-filled section and reach over it to access the wall. It\u2019s easiest to start against the longest wall in the room and build off of that. You can run the floorboards parallel or perpendicular to your longest wall. It\u2019s completely up to you whether you want to create columns or rows. If you aren\u2019t sure which option is best, run the boards parallel to the wall. This is the most common option. If you can do this in a corner, do that. If your corner isn\u2019t a perfect 90-degrees though, leave a 1 ft (0.30 m) space and fill the area in later with a board you cut to size."

This way, you can add as many pre-cut pieces as possible before running into the need to cut out additional pieces for the corners or doorways. When you add a new section of glue, always add it away from the door so that you don\u2019t need to walk over boards as they dry."

Then, gently move it against the edge of the board so that the 2 pieces are flush with one another. Continue adding floorboards until you get within 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) of the end of the glue. Use a rubber mallet to force 2 boards flush together if you can\u2019t get a perfect fit. Gently tap the side of a board to force it into place. You can only lay a new board down if you have enough glue remaining in a section to completely cover the bottom of the board. Some bamboo flooring kits have slots on one side of the board and corresponding shapes on the other side. These bamboo boards snap into one another.

Create another rectangular section by spreading the adhesive around with your trowel the same way you did before. Move the trowel around at a 45-degree angle in a serpentine pattern until the adhesive is level. Repeat this process whenever you run out of adhesive.

After cutting the board to size, return to the installation area and fit the board into the slot. This process is a lot smoother if you have someone to help you. One person can cut the pieces to size while the other person installs boards elsewhere on the floor. Do your best to lay corners down before you enclose the entire area in surrounding boards.

Then, wait at least 24 hours to give your floor some time to dry out.Tip: If all of your boards seem warped or are there are a ton of gaps in between boards, you likely installed the floor before the bamboo had acclimated to the space.

Use a nailgun to install the quarter-round over the expansion gap, and place 1 nail every 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm). Quarter-round refers to trim that is literally 1/4 of a round piece of wood. It is the most common trim for floorboards. You will need to miter your corners for corners of the room where 2 pieces of trim meet. To do this, cut your corners at a 45-degree angle and fit them together. If your floor isn\u2019t perfectly level, you\u2019ll end up with gaps between the bamboo and the quarter-round.

Cut uniquely-shaped or oddly-sized pieces to size as you encounter the gaps. Keep doing this until your floor is completely covered. You can use a miter saw, table saw, or reciprocating saw to cut pieces out of boards for vents, baseboard, or corners. Do these pieces towards the end of the installation process whenever possible. Finishing Your New Floor Fix any raised boards and allow your floor to dry for at least 24 hours. Once your flooring is laid down, walk carefully around the floor to press the boards down. Look for raised edges on your bamboo flooring. If you find any, gently tap them with a large rubber mallet to push the glue down and straighten the board. Then, wait at least 24 hours to give your floor some time to dry out.Tip: If all of your boards seem warped or are there are a ton of gaps in between boards, you likely installed the floor before the bamboo had acclimated to the space. You\u2019ll need to repeat this process again and double the acclimation time if this happens. This is why the acclimation is so important! You can use a commercial roller instead if you want to ensure a completely flat finish. Clean your floorboards to remove any fingerprints and dust. Your bamboo flooring is likely covered in footprints and fingerprints at this point. There may also be excess dust or polyurethane residue laying on top. Use a broom, vacuum, and clean cloth to remove any marks and clean up your floor. Do not get your bamboo floorboards wet at this point. The adhesive needs a little more time to cure completely and water can interfere with this process. Remove your spacers and install quarter-round or trim around the walls. With your floorboards in place, measure the distance between each wall to determine how long your trim should be. Mark each cut with a carpentry pencil and use quarter-round cutters or a miter saw to cut your trim to size. Use a nailgun to install the quarter-round over the expansion gap, and place 1 nail every 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm). Quarter-round refers to trim that is literally 1/4 of a round piece of wood. It is the most common trim for floorboards. You will need to miter your corners for corners of the room where 2 pieces of trim meet. To do this, cut your corners at a 45-degree angle and fit them together. If your floor isn\u2019t perfectly level, you\u2019ll end up with gaps between the bamboo and the quarter-round. To seal this area, apply a thin bead of silicone caulk to the gap and wipe the excess away.",

    "Use a measuring tape to measure the length and width of your floor.",
    "Multiply these numbers together to determine the square footage of your floor.",
    "For oddly shaped sections of your floor, measure the area separately in smaller sections that are easier to manage.",
    "Then, add all of your sections together to determine the overall square footage.",
    "For example, if one section of your floor is 80 square feet (8.9 sq yd), and another section of your floor is 22 square feet (2.4 sq yd), you need at least 102 square feet (11.3 sq yd) of flooring.",
    "Order more than enough bamboo flooring to cover your floor entirely.",
    "Buy roughly 15-20% more flooring than you need to ensure that you have backup boards in the event that you make a mistake or accidentally break a few boards.",
    "Bamboo flooring comes in a variety of stains and colors, so choose a flooring that fits your personal preference.",
    "For example, if you\u2019re covering 102 square feet (11.3 sq yd) of flooring, buy roughly 125 square feet (13.9 sq yd) of bamboo.",
    "If you can, purchase planks that are pre-cut into different sizes to avoid the need for cutting pieces to different sizes.",
    "Remove your old flooring if you already have a floor installed.",
    "Put on a set of thick work boots and a strong pair of work gloves.",
    "If you have hardwood floors, use a pry bar to rip the individual boards out of the floor.",
    "If you have carpet, use a utility knife to cut a corner up and pry the rest of it up by using a pry bar or pulling it up by hand.",
    "Use a nail remove to pry out any remaining nails that are sticking out of your floor.",
    "If your subfloor is already exposed, go ahead and skip this step.",
    "If your flooring is laminated, use a utility knife to cut a seam in the flooring and peel it up by hand.",
    "Laminate flooring is typically quite easy to pull up once you\u2019ve cut it.",
    "Watch out for nails or screws that are sticking out of your floor.",
    "Remove them as you work to avoid cutting your feet.",
    "This is a pretty tough process and it can easily take 6-12 hours on its own depending on your stamina and the stubbornness of your flooring.",
    "Clean the subfloor thoroughly with a vacuum and damp cloth.",
    "Discard your old flooring, nails, or screws.",
    "Scrape away any old adhesive with a floor sander or a putty knife.",
    "Then, sweep and vacuum your flooring thoroughly.",
    "Wipe any dust or glue residue with a damp cloth and let your flooring air dry for 12-24 hours.Tip: If your subfloor is made of concrete, pour a little water on it after cleaning the subfloor.",
    "If the water soaks into the concrete, you have nothing to worry about.",
    "If the water beads up though, you have a sealant on the concrete and the glue won\u2019t bond with it.",
    "Rent a floor sander and run it over your flooring to wear away this sealant.",
    "If there is any dirt or residue on your floor when you install the floorboards, the flooring glue may not grip the subfloor correctly and your bamboo may come loose over time.",
    "Acclimate the bamboo by leaving it inside your home for 72 hours.",
    "The bamboo flooring will expand, shrink, and bend slightly as it acclimates to the humidity and temperature in your home.",
    "To avoid this, unpack your floorboards once they arrive.",

    "Keep the temperature in your home at 60\u201380 \u00b0F (16\u201327 \u00b0C) for the 3 days you\u2019re acclimating the bamboo.",
    "Do this in the room where you\u2019re going to install them and leave them out for 72 hours to let them acclimate to your room.",
    "This step is more important than it probably sounds.",
    "Your bamboo boards will not sit flat if you install them without acclimating them first.",
    "Cut your floorboards into random lengths if they aren\u2019t pre-cut.",
    "To avoid a uniform floor where all of the seams are on the same plane, cut your boards into random lengths using a circular or miter saw.",
    "Set your boards up on sawhorses and put on protective eyewear, a dust mask, and gloves.",
    "Turn your saw on and cut through each board at a 90-degree angle to make straight cuts.Tip: It may be tempting to be more methodical about this, but even if you do measure out specific planks and determine where they belong ahead of time, it will be exceptionally difficult to keep track of where each piece goes.",
    "Your spacers will also mess with your design and make it hard to fit each piece together.",
    "Most floorboards are between 4\u20138 feet (1.2\u20132.4 m) in length, but you can cut them in any pattern you want.",
    "Do this outside to avoid leaving sawdust all over your subfloor.",
    "You\u2019ll cut smaller pieces later to fill in small gaps between boards as you lay them.",
    "You can use a table saw if you prefer.",
    "Applying the Glue Use spacers to keep a 0.5\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm) gap around the walls.",
    "Before adding your first layer of glue, stick spacers in between the subfloor and the wall.",
    "The thickness of these spacers should be identical to the thickness of your boards.",
    "In most cases, this will be 0.5\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm).",
    "Put 1 spacer every 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) to ensure that there\u2019s an even gap between the wall and the bamboo boards.",
    "As time passes and the bamboo absorbs moisture, the floorboards will expand.",
    "The spacers will leave an expansion gap around the wall and ensure that your boards don\u2019t buckle or break when they expand.",
    "Buy a flooring glue with a built-in moisture barrier to keep things simple.",
    "Purchase a polyurethane adhesive designed for wood flooring.",
    "Get an adhesive with a built-in moisture barrier to avoid the need for multiple layers.",
    "If you don\u2019t get an adhesive with a built-in moisture protection, you\u2019ll need to coat your floor in a separate moisture barrier before applying your adhesive.",
    "There is no benefit to adding a moisture barrier separately.",
    "This is simply a more time-consuming and expensive way of protecting your floor.",
    "Apply glue to the area near your longest wall using a trowel.",
    "Put on a pair of thick gloves.",
    "Pour a 0.5\u20131 gallon (1.9\u20133.8 L) of floor adhesive directly on to your floor.",
    "Spread the glue out by dragging your trowel over the adhesive at a 45-degree angle while pressing it into the subfloor.",
    "Spread the adhesive out across a small rectangular section of the floor.",
    "Work in a serpentine pattern and address lumpy areas by covering every section 2-3 times.",
    "The glue should be evenly spread out across the section that you\u2019re working.",
    "There should be no obvious pools of glue and every section should have the parallel marks from the teeth of your trowel.",
    "You\u2019re going to work in small sections by pouring glue, spreading it out, and adding your boards.",
    "The size of your sections is entirely up to you.",
    "Working in 2\u20133 by 8 feet (0.61\u20130.91 by 2.44 m) sections is a good average working pace.",
    "Do not step in the glue and keep your sections thin enough that you can reach over them while kneeling.",
    "Installing the Bamboo Boards Place the longest board you have against the longest wall in the room.",
    "Take your longest, straightest board and lower it against the wall and into the floor.",
    "Press it gently against the spacers to ensure that your board is flush against the wall.",
    "Then, push directly down on the floorboard to push the glue into the subfloor and the bottom of the board.Warning: Avoid sliding your floor boards into place.",
    "If your floorboard slides on the glue, you\u2019ll move the adhesive around and may end up uneven boards.",
    "It\u2019s okay if you slide a board 0.25\u20131 in (0.64\u20132.54 cm) when you\u2019re installing it against a wall, though.",
    "Don\u2019t step on your glue while doing this.",
    "Kneel in front of the glue-filled section and reach over it to access the wall.",
    "It\u2019s easiest to start against the longest wall in the room and build off of that.",
    "You can run the floorboards parallel or perpendicular to your longest wall.",
    "It\u2019s completely up to you whether you want to create columns or rows.",
    "If you aren\u2019t sure which option is best, run the boards parallel to the wall.",
    "This is the most common option.",
    "If you can do this in a corner, do that.",
    "If your corner isn\u2019t a perfect 90-degrees though, leave a 1 ft (0.30 m) space and fill the area in later with a board you cut to size.",
    "Finish a row in your glued section before adding more rows.",
    "To keep things easy, fill out an entire row of your glued section with boards before adding adjacent pieces.",
    "This way, you can add as many pre-cut pieces as possible before running into the need to cut out additional pieces for the corners or doorways.",
    "When you add a new section of glue, always add it away from the door so that you don\u2019t need to walk over boards as they dry.",
    "Install a new row of boards next to your first row.",
    "Grab another board and lower it into place against the board you just installed.",
    "Lower it as close as you can to the edge where your first floorboard ends.",
    "Then, gently move it against the edge of the board so that the 2 pieces are flush with one another.",
    "Continue adding floorboards until you get within 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) of the end of the glue.",
    "Use a rubber mallet to force 2 boards flush together if you can\u2019t get a perfect fit.",
    "Gently tap the side of a board to force it into place.",
    "You can only lay a new board down if you have enough glue remaining in a section to completely cover the bottom of the board.",
    "Some bamboo flooring kits have slots on one side of the board and corresponding shapes on the other side.",
    "These bamboo boards snap into one another.",
    "Always match the slot to a cutout edge and vice versa when working with these floorboards.",
    "This will ensure a perfect fit.",
    "Add new layers of adhesive by pouring more out as you work.",
    "Once you\u2019re close to the edge of the glue, stop adding boards and apply a fresh 0.5\u20131 US gal (1.9\u20133.8 L) of glue.",
    "Create another rectangular section by spreading the adhesive around with your trowel the same way you did before.",
    "Move the trowel around at a 45-degree angle in a serpentine pattern until the adhesive is level.",
    "Repeat this process whenever you run out of adhesive.",
    "Keep a polyurethane wipe in your back pocket as you work so that you can wipe up any glue that accidentally gets on top of the floorboards you\u2019ve already installed.",
    "Continue adding floorboards by pressing them against one another.",
    "Once you have a new section of glue, continue to add new floorboards.",
    "Avoid laying them in a way where the ends of boards line up perfectly.",
    "In other words, lay some boards down that they stick out past the board next to it and lay some boards down so that they don\u2019t stick out past the previous board.",
    "If the bamboo flooring won\u2019t lay flat, gently tap the surface of the board or the edges with a rubber mallet to knock it into place.",
    "If the ends of your boards line up perfectly, you\u2019re going to end up with a strange, symmetrical pattern on the floor.",
    "Most wood floors are laid specifically so that the ends of the boards never line up.",
    "One way to ensure that the boards don\u2019t line up is to lay the middle of every board up against the end of the previous board you laid.",
    "This way, the end of each board will always bisect the board lying next to it.",
    "Cut unique pieces out as you work to fill in gaps.",
    "As you complete lengths of the floor, you will end up with small gaps near your walls, corners, and doorways where your precut pieces won\u2019t fit.",
    "When you encounter these, use a measuring tape to determine how long the piece for this slot must be.",
    "Go back to your saw and cut a board to size so that it fits the slot you just measured.",
    "After cutting the board to size, return to the installation area and fit the board into the slot.",
    "This process is a lot smoother if you have someone to help you.",
    "One person can cut the pieces to size while the other person installs boards elsewhere on the floor.",
    "Do your best to lay corners down before you enclose the entire area in surrounding boards.",
    "This way, you\u2019ll always have an angle to slide the board into the corner.",
    "For door jambs, slide boards underneath the edges instead of cutting them to size to make things easier.",
