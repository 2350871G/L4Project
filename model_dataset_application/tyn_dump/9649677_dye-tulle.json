  "text":" Dip-Dyeing Tulle on a Stovetop Wash your fabric. Before starting the dyeing process, make sure to run your fabric through the washing machine on whatever cycle you normally use for laundry. Doing so will help remove any chemicals that could taint the tint. Though detergent is fine, avoid using fabric softener since it can leave a film on the tulle, leading to an uneven dye job. Fill a disposable pot with water and heat it to a medium temperature. Grab a pot big enough that you can easily and fully submerge your fabric in it. Use a pot you don\u2019t mind ruining, since the dye chemicals may make it unsafe to cook with.

To make sure your dye is completely set, run just your tulle through a low-load wash cycle with detergent. Then, place it in the dryer or, if you prefer, hang it out to air dry. Dyeing Tulle in a Washing Machine Prewash your tulle. To remove any chemicals present on your fabric, run it through a simple wash cycle with detergent, using whatever settings you normally do for laundry. Do not use fabric softener as it may hamper the dyeing process by leaving a thin film on the tulle. Soak your tulle in hot water. To prepare your fabric for the dye mix, change your washer\u2019s temperature setting to hot, then use the soak option to thoroughly dampen the tulle. If necessary, fluff the item after the soak to make sure it is loose and fully extended. Pour a liquid dye mix into the detergent slot. This should not stain the dispenser as long as you rinse it immediately afterwards. Make sure to shake the dye well before putting it in, and wear rubber gloves while handling it to avoid staining your skin. Add hot water to the detergent slot equal to the amount of dye you used. To flush any excess dye residue out of your detergent slot, fill it with at least an equal amount of hot water. This means that, if you used 1 bottle of dye, you should rinse the dispenser with at least 1 bottle of hot water. Put in 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of detergent. Though you don\u2019t need a lot, adding in some detergent will help better distribute the dye to every spot on the fabric, making sure it tints as evenly as possible. Add 4 cups (950 ml) of hot salt water after 10 minutes of soaking. After adding the dye and detergent, let the tulle soak for about 10 minutes. At that time, put 1 cup (240 ml) of salt in 4 cups (950 ml) of hot water and stir the solution until the salt dissolves. Then, pour the mixture into the detergent slot to help your fabric soak up the dye. Pour in 1 cup (240 ml) of vinegar and another 2 cups (470 ml) of hot water if you\u2019re dyeing nylon or silk. Wash your tulle and dye in hot, high water. Choose the longest cycle available, making sure to select any extra rinse and spin options, then start the washer. Run the washing machine with warm water and detergent until the tulle stops bleeding ink. Once the dye wash is finished, change your washing machine\u2019s water temperature to warm and pour a capful of soap into the detergent slot.

Rayon is very susceptible to dyes and you can color it with any chemical solution that works on cotton. This includes fiber reactive dyes, direct dyes, all purpose dyes, vat dyes, naphthol dyes, and natural dyes. Color silk tulle using almost any dye. More than even rayon, silk holds dye incredibly well and you can tint it with just about any kind. In particular, silk yields good results when submerged in fiber reactive dyes, acid dyes, direct dyes, and vat dyes.",
