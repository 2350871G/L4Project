If you invite many more than 8 people, your guests will be waiting around a long time between pampering stations and get bored. You should also make sure that everyone you invite to your party gets along. Consider different personality types, past arguments, and mutual friends and acquaintances."

To fit a spa-themed party, look for soft colors or relaxing backgrounds like beaches or clouds. Use words that make people think of relaxing or being pampered on your invitations. Invite them to a \u201csoothing night of relaxation\u201d or \u201can afternoon of unwinding.\u201d\nSend the invitations 3-4 weeks before your scheduled party date. It\u2019s important to time invitations just right. If you send them too close to the party date, people will already have other plans. But, if you send them too much before the party, your guests might forget."

Beginning up to a week before, vacuum, dust, clean windows, scrub the bathrooms, and deep-clean the kitchen. Then, on the day of the party, just do any quick touch-ups that you need to make the house party-perfect. If you live with anyone, ask them to help with the cleaning and to be extra mindful of picking up after themselves throughout the week."

Add a few potted plants or a vase of flowers to the party area to give the space a little added serenity. The amount and type of decorations depend on your budget and how much extra work you want to put in. They are optional and not completely necessary for having a nice party. Some examples of decorations you could put out at the stations are little signs identifying what to do at each spot, some cute trays for supplies, plants, or flowers. You could also hang a welcome banner outside or put some balloons on the mailbox so your guests know they found the right place.

Second, pick a mood for the party and stick to it with the music. Your spa party could be really zen and have jazz or classical music, or it could be fun and funky with pop and rock hits. Music and mood go hand-in-hand when hosting a party."
