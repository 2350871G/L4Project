If you need to round your measurement, round up. Measure all 4 walls if you\u2019re redoing a room or repairing a bad molding job. If the wall you\u2019re measuring is longer than your tape measure, just measure from 1 side of the wall as far as your tape measure will go. For example, say it\u2019s 100 inches (250 cm). Mark the spot with a pencil. Then, measure from the other side of the wall to the pencil mark. Add the 2 measurements together to find the full length of molding you\u2019ll need.

Turn the base until the indicator points to 45 degrees. A miter saw comprises a large spinning saw blade that you\u2019ll lower into an adjustable base. Since molding boards need to fit tightly together in a corner (or over the outward-facing corner of a wall), both angles should be exactly 45 degrees. Some types of miter saw may require you to loosen a knob before you can adjust the base\u2019s angle.

Using a Miter Saw to Cut Crown Molding Slip a jig under the molding board so it rests at 45\u00b0 against the base. Crown molding is installed at a 45-degree angle between the ceiling and the wall. Hold the molding against the base of your saw so that the upper edge lies flat against the back of the saw. Then, slip a small piece of board or scrap wood against the lower edge of molding to hold it in place. You can use any type of scrap board as the jig. Or, if you prefer not to make your own, you can purchase a jig from a hardware store. Clamp the jig in place with a C clamp. The clamp will keep the jig in position and ensure that your crown molding will be at an exact 45-degree angle for cutting. If you\u2019re cutting multiple pieces of crown molding, leave the jig clamped in place for each cut. Cut 1 crown molding board at a 90\u00b0 angle. The first piece of crown molding you cut will span the length of a wall and butt into both corners at a 90\u00b0 angle. Make sure that your miter saw is set to 90\u00b0 and will cut straight ahead, then make the cuts. Be careful not to bump the jig out of place when you\u2019re moving the crown molding board around. Cut inside corners by cutting a molding board at a 45\u00b0 angle. Set a second molding board in position against the saw and the jib. If you\u2019re going to position this board on the right side of the already-cut molding, set the saw 45\u00b0 to the left. If you\u2019re positioning this board to the left side of the already-cut molding, set the saw 45\u00b0 to the right. Once the board is in position, make the cut. When you position the 2 crown molding boards on the wall, the first board you cut will butt square into the corner. The second molding board will slip into place against the first, leaving no gap between the boards. Use a coping saw to trace the profile of the molding onto the edge of one piece after making your miter cut. This will help make your corners easier to install. Make outside corners by cutting 2 crown molding boards at 45\u00b0. For an outside corner, you\u2019ll only need 45-degree angle cuts. Rotate the saw to the left 45-degree mark and cut 1 board. Make sure the board is held tightly in place against the jib. Then, rotate the saw to the right 45-degree mark and cut your second board.
