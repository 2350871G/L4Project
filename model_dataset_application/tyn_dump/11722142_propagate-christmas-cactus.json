  "text":" Taking Cuttings from Your Cactus Take your cuttings in late spring for the best chance of growth. Christmas cacti generally start growing around May and bloom in November or December. It's best to take cuttings at the beginning of the growing season in early spring. This gives the cactus time to emerge from its post-blooming rest period and initiate new growth. Technically, you can take your cuttings any time during the year, but doing it in early spring gives you the best chance of successfully growing a new, healthy plant. Find a healthy stem on the cactus to take your cutting from. Examine your host Christmas cactus for a branch that doesn\u2019t have an brown spots. In addition, look for a branch that has at least 2 cladophylls (branch segments), since cuttings generally need at least 2 branch segments to take root.You can generally take multiple cuttings from a healthy host plant without harming it, but don't take off too much. Pinch off 2 to 5 healthy branch segments from your cactus with your fingers. Remove 2 to 5 of the flattened segments of the branch by pinching them off at the joint with your fingers. You may need to twist and fold the branch at the joint to loosen it up enough so you can pinch the segments off.You can also cut the segments off at the joint with a small knife. Leave the cuttings on a dry surface overnight. Lay the cuttings out in a single layer on a dry surface indoors so the joint can begin to heal. In most cases, you can leave it out to dry for up to 2 days.If you leave the cutting out for several days, it may start to wilt at the ends. If this happens, pinch off the wilted end segments so only the healthy segments remain. Using a Rooting Medium Fill a small pot with perlite or coarse sand. While your cuttings are drying, fill a small pot with a drain hole to the brim with a Christmas cactus rooting medium, such as perlite, coarse sand, or a half and half combination of the two. You can also use a half and half mix of seed and cuttings compost and course sand instead of perlite. Run water over the rooting medium to dampen it. Place the filled pot in the sink and water the rooting medium until it\u2019s damp across the top. Leave the pot in the sink for a few minutes to allow the water to drain through. Dip the tip of the cutting in rooting hormone powder to stimulate growth, if desired. To increase the chance that your cutting with take root, dip the end of the cutting into a rooting hormone powder until it\u2019s covered with powder. Tap the branch gently to remove any excess powder before planting the cutting.While using a rooting hormone may help stimulate growth, you can propagate Christmas cactus without it. If you don\u2019t want to use a rooting hormone, skip this step. Insert about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of your cutting into the rooting medium. Hold the cutting upright and press the bottom end into the rooting medium about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) deep. Lightly press the perlite or sand rooting medium down around the cutting to help it stand upright.If you\u2019re planting multiple cuttings in the same pot, plant them 2 to 6 inches (5.1 to 15.2 cm) apart.

Growing Roots in Water Fill the bottom of a jar with stones and water. First, fill the bottom third of a jar with medium-sized stones.
