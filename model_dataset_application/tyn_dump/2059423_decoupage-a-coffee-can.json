If you are using Mod Podge or a similar decoupage glue, apply several thin coats of the glue over the entire surface of the coffee can. Check the product packaging for recommended wait times between coats. You can also seal the coffee can using a thinned mixture of craft glue and water. If you are worried about a hazy, translucent finish using this method, test the glue mixture first on another surface."
