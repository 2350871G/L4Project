    "In this case, start a second stack for another freezer bag.",
    "Slide the layered leaves into a freezer bag to store for up to 6 months.",
    "Carefully work the stack of wax paper and basil leaves into the zip-close bag, then gently press out most of the air.",
    "Zip the bag fully closed and write \u201cbasil\u201d and today\u2019s date on the bag with a permanent marker.",
    "Lay the bag flat in the freezer in a spot where it won\u2019t get crushed.",
    "When you\u2019re ready to use the basil, simply open the bag, pull out the number of leaves you need, squeeze out the air, and close the bag again.",
    "Especially if blanched, frozen basil leaves should be vibrant and flavorful enough to use in cooked recipes or even fresh pesto.",
    "The thawed leaves will likely be too wilted to use as a fresh ingredient or garnish, however.",
    "After about 3-6 months, the leaves will start to develop brown or black spots.",
    "Once there are as many dark spots as green areas, discard the leaves.",
    "Keeping Potted Basil Indoors Buy a small potted basil from your grocer\u2019s produce department.",
    "The easiest way to keep basil fresh is to keep it alive!",
    "Instead of buying a cut bunch of basil at the supermarket, check to see if they also sell small potted basil plants.",
    "These usually come in biodegradable \u201cpots\u201d and are typically sold right next to the fresh cut herbs.",
    "Alternatively, grow your own basil from seeds either outdoors (when the climate permits) or indoors.",
    "Set the pot on a windowsill that gets ample sunlight.",
    "Ideally, basil should get 6-8 hours of sunlight per day.",
    "If that\u2019s not possible where you live, pick the sunniest windowsill you have.",
    "It\u2019s very convenient to have the basil plant on your kitchen windowsill, but it\u2019s more important to find a sunny spot.",
    "Keep the potting medium evenly moist with regular watering.",
    "Stick your index finger 1 in (2.5 cm) down into the potting medium every 1-2 days.",
    "If it feels dry at your fingertip, add water until the potting medium looks soaked but not oversaturated.",
    "The goal is to keep the potting medium evenly moist.",
    "You\u2019ll likely figure out the proper watering frequency within a week.",
    "Pluck off fresh leaves right when you need them.",
    "This is the best part about having fresh, live basil right at your fingertips.",
    "Identify the most colorful, crisp-tender leaves and pluck just the number you need at that moment.",
    "For instance, grab a few of the prettiest leaves to make your guests a range of delicious basil cocktails!",
    "Remove and discard leaves that have wilted or developed brown or black spots.",
    "Replace it with a new potted basil every several weeks, as needed.",
    "Kept in its original compostable pot, the supermarket basil plant will likely give you 1-2 months of high-quality basil leaves.",
    "Once it stops producing abundantly, go ahead and get a replacement from the grocery store.",
    "The basil will likely last longer if you transfer it to a larger pot, but it may also grow larger than you\u2019d prefer, especially if you have space limitations."
