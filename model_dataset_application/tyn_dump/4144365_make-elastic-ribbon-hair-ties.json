Sometimes, it's labeled as \"elastic ribbon.\" You can find it online and in fabric stores. It's a smooth elastic with a crease down the middle. It comes in many different colors and patterns. Buy a ribbon slide. You can find these alongside the fold over elastics. You can also use a small, decorative buckle, as long as it does not have a prong. Look for a round, square, or oval ring with a vertical bar running through it. Choose a design that matches your elastic ribbon. Make sure that the ribbon slide fits over the elastic.
