Place the board in your miter saw with the back facing you and cut the 45 degree angle so that the cut is on the back of the board. The back edge of your cut should be lined up with the corner of the wall. Cut the next board for the external corner at an opposite 45 degree angle.

Fit the two boards together at the external corner and make any small adjustments to the cuts until they fit snug against the wall and each other. Attaching the Boards Attach boards to a plasterboard wall with instant-grab adhesive. Spread instant-grab adhesive in a zig-zag pattern on the back of the boards. Press them against the wall with the bottom edges tight against the ground. Wipe away any excess adhesive that seeps out of the edges. If you are installing new carpet or flooring, make sure to attach the boards after it is installed so they go in at the right level and tight against the new flooring.
