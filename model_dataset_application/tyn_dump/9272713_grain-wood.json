If you\u2019re working indoors, lay down a few sheets of newspaper under the surface you\u2019ll be painting. This will prevent paint from dripping down onto your flooring."

You could work on a picnic table (or other outdoor table) or set up a couple of sawhorses and grain the MDF across those.

This will remove any rough spots or upright fibers on the MDF. Sand lightly in long, straight strokes and run the sandpaper over the MDF in the direction you plan to paint on the wood grain. Sandpaper should be readily available at any local hardware store. It\u2019s typically sold either in single sheets or packages of 15 or 20."

Then, pour in an equal amount of a clear acrylic glaze. Stir the paint and glaze together using a wooden painter\u2019s stick. If you use up the first 2 cups (473 mL) of glaze, make another batch.

Since you\u2019ll be applying multiple layers of paint during this project, it\u2019s best if you put on old clothing that you don\u2019t mind getting dirty. Paint stains clothing and is next to impossible to remove, so plan your outfit accordingly. If you dislike getting paint on your hands, you could also wear a pair of leather work gloves.
