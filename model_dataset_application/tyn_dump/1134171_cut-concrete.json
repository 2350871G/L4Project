Use your dominant hand to grip the back handle and push the blade forward and backward. Begin cutting at the edge of the concrete and slowly follow the chalk line. Don't press the blade into the ground\u2014let the weight of the blade and saw do the work. Remove the blade every 30 to 45 seconds to avoid overheating. If you're not using a wet-cutting diamond blade and the saw is gas powered, pour water onto your blade as you cut to reduce dust and blade temperature. A garden hose that is set very low is perfect for this. Always wear eye protection when using a circular saw."
