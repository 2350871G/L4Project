Always wear safety glasses when you\u2019re working with power tools. Keep your fingers away from the saw blade. If you can\u2019t safely hold onto the blank when you make your cuts, use a push guide to help move your blank through the saw blade safely.

Once you finish the profile on one side of the spoon, flip the wood to the other side and draw the outline there as well. Take measurements of the bowl\u2019s depth after you draw one side of the spoon so you can draw it exactly the same on the other side.

  "text":" Cutting the Basic Shape Start with a hardwood blank. Blanks are wooden blocks that you can cut and carve your spoons from. Pick a hardwood, such as walnut, cherry, or maple for the most durability. Aim to get a blank that\u2019s 9 in \u00d7 2 \u20442 in (22.9 cm \u00d7 6.4 cm) and about \u20444 in (1.9 cm) thick for 1 wooden spoon. If you want to try making multiple spoons, get a piece of wood that\u2019s 9 in \u00d7 5 in (23 cm \u00d7 13 cm). That way, you can carve 3 separate spoons from your blank. You can also buy blocks of wood meant for carving through online retailers. Draw the design of your spoon on your wood. Use a marker or pencil to draw the top view of your spoon on the wood. Be sure the length of your spoon follows the direction of the wood grain on your blank to make your spoon stronger. Draw a circle or an egg-shape inside the rounded part of your spoon so it almost reaches the edges of the outline. You'll carve the bowl of your spoon within this circle.Tip: Many websites offer templates for spoons that you can print out and trace onto your wood. Cut around your spoon\u2019s outline with a bandsaw. Turn on the bandsaw and slowly push your blank through the blade. Follow closely along with the outline of your spoon so it\u2019s easier to carve later on. Once you have the general shape of your spoon finished, turn off your saw and wait for it to completely stop before grabbing your spoon.

Once you secure the spoon to your work surface, try pushing it to see if the grip holds.Tip: If 1 clamp isn\u2019t enough to hold the spoon sturdy while you\u2019re working, then place a second clamp near the middle of the handle.
