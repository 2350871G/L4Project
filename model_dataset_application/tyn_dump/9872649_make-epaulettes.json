It can span from the base of your neck all the way to your shoulder cap, or it can be just long enough to cover your shoulder cap. After you cut the template out, fold it in half lengthwise, then cut off any excess paper that hangs over the edges. This will help make it symmetrical."

If this is for a uniform, however, the trim should match the trim on your uniform. You can find tassel trims in both the regular trim section and the upholstery trim section of a fabric store. Assembling the Pieces Pin the tassel trim to the front of 1 upper epaulette piece. Turn 1 of your upper epaulette pieces so that the front (right side) is facing you. Wrap the trim around the edge so that the tassels are pointing into the epaulette. The edge of the trim should be touching the edge of the epaulette. Secure both pieces with sewing pins.

Sew around the epaulette, but don't sew across the straight edge. As with the upper fabric, use a straight stitch and a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Remove the pins as you sew and remember to backstitch. Do not sew across the straight edge that faces your neck. You need this gap for turning the epaulette right-side-out. Trim the seam allowances, then turn the epaulette right-side-out. Cut the seams off so that you get \u20448 to \u20444 in (0.32 to 0.64 cm) seam allowances. Sew around the raw edges with a zigzag stitch for extra durability. Next, turn the epaulette right-side-out through the gap along the straight edge. Slide the cardboard into the epaulette, then sew the end shut. Take 1 of your cardboard shapes and slide it into the epaulette. Fold the raw edges of the straight edge into the epaulette, then sew it shut by hand using a ladder stitch. Alternatively, fold the raw edge under the epaulette, then sew across it with a straight stitch. Repeat the process for the second epaulette. Pin and sew the tassel trim to the right side of the upper piece. Pin the bottom piece right-side-down on top of the epaulette, then sew it down as well. Turn the epaulette right-side-out, then fold the raw edges in and sew them down. Decorating the Epaulette Choose a flat, braided trim to go around the top edge of your epaulette. Epaulettes have a fancy trim along the top edge. It often looks like a woven or braided ribbon, about \u20444 to \u20442 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) wide. They come in all sorts of colors, but you should choose one that matches the tassel trim. Do not use a round rope. Choose a flat, braided trim. Another option is to use a sequin trim. You can find these in the regular and upholstery trim sections of a fabric store. Measure the top, inside edge of your epaulette, then add 1 inch (2.5 cm). Make sure that you are only measuring the edge that has the tassel trim attached; do not measure along the straight edge. Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to your measurement so that you can fold it under the epaulette in the end. Cut your trim according to your measurements. Some braided trims will start to unravel as soon as you cut them. You can stop this from happening by sewing across the cut ends, sealing them with a drop of glue, or wrapping clear tape around them. If you wrap clear tape, make sure that the braided trim stays flat. Don't wrap the tape so tightly that it curls up into a rope. Pin the trim to the top of the epaulette, making sure it's centered. The cording needs to go on top of the upper fabric. It can sit right next to the tassels and touch them, or you can leave a small gap between the cording and the tassels. You will have some extra trim hanging off of the ends of your epaulette. Make sure that you have an equal amount of trim on each side. Find the center of the braided trim before you start pinning it. This will ensure that you have an equal amount of excess trim hanging off of the end of the epaulette. Fold the ends of the trim down by \u20442 inch (1.3 cm). Flip the epaulette over so that you can see the back. Fold the ends of the trim down until they are snug against the edge of the epaulette, about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm), then secure them with pins.
