  "text":" Caramelizing Onions Set two heavy skillets on your stovetop. Seasoned cast iron skillets are best, because they impart flavors similar to those in a dinner grill. Turn one burner to medium heat. Cut an onion in half. Slice it into rings. A quarter of an onion per sandwich is required. Melt two tbsp. of butter in the first skillet. You can also use olive oil or canola oil in place of butter. Place your onion rings in the skillet. Stir them around until they are covered in oil or butter. Then, allow them to cook without stirring for 10 minutes. Flip the onions onto the opposite side with a spatula. Let them cook without stirring on this side for 10 minutes. Turn the onions again. Adjust the temperature to a low setting. Stir them occasionally until they appear caramelized, approximately 15 minutes. Cooking the Patty Place one-quarter lb. (113g) of ground beef in a bowl. You will need one-quarter lb. per patty melt. Add salt, pepper, and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the bowl and mix the ingredients together.  Find a rectangle shaped Tupperware container to use as your patty shaper. Grease it with cooking spray. Press the patty into the bottom of the rectangle container to form a patty that will cover your entire slice of bread. Heat the other skillet to high heat. Add two tbsp. (28.4g) of butter or oil to the skillet when it is heated. Flip your container upside down and pat it onto a plate. Your pressed patty should be ready to cook. Add the patty to your heated skillet. Leave it until a crust starts to form, approximately two minutes later. Flip the patty with a spatula. Give it two to three minutes to cook on the other side. When it is done, place it on a plate nearby. Assembling the Patty Melt Clean one of your skillets with a paper towel. Make sure there aren\u2019t any burned bits that will change the taste of your sandwich. Heat two tbsp. (28.4g) of butter on medium heat. Assemble the sandwich. Stack in this order: piece of rye bread, slice of Swiss cheese, burger patty, caramelized onions, slice of Swiss cheese and slice of rye bread. Add the sandwich to the skillet. Grill one side until it is golden brown. Remove it and place it on your plate. Melt two more tbsp. (28.4g) of butter. Flip the sandwich and grill the other side in the butter. Remove it when both pieces of bread are toasted golden brown and the cheese has melted. ",
