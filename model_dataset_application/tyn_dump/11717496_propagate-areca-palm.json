Areca palms can be grown in pots that are as small as 6 in (15 cm) and as large as 52 in (130 cm). You can use peat and sand as an alternative for traditional soil mixes, as long as you combine them in a 3:1 ratio. You can also use a mixture of peat, sand, and pine bark, which can be combined in a 6:1:3 ratio.Did you know? Areca palms serve as a great barrier plant for your yard, and can add a level of privacy to your property. You can also plant these palms in a pot and keep them inside."
