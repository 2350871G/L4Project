Make sure that the flat parts of the slices are pressed up against the walls of the jar so that they are visible. You don't have to use all 3 types of citrus fruit. You can use just 1 or 2 types of citrus fruit. For more color and fragrance, add some herbs, such as rosemary sprigs, star anise, cloves, or cinnamon sticks.

If you decide to use a brand-new birthday candle, cut the wick in half after you crumble the wax off to make it shorter. The length of the wick won't affect how long the candle will burn; the amount of oil you use will. If the wick is too long, it will just burn and fall into the water. For some reason, waxed wicks and cotton wicks don\u2019t seem to work very well for this type of candle. Stick with birthday candle wicks. If you are able to find floating wicks online or in a store, you can use those instead and skip this section. They are floating metal disks with wicks inside of them."

The circle doesn\u2019t need to be perfect, but it needs to be small enough to fit inside your jar. If you are using a plastic bottle, cut the circle from the domed part.

The wider your jar is, the more oil you will need to use. Don\u2019t worry if the oil mixes into the water at first; it will float to the top. Most jars will require 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) of oil. About 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of oil will burn for up to 2 hours.
