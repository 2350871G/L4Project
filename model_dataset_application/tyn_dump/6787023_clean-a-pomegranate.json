Press down just hard enough to slice through the skin, but not the fruit itself. There should be 4-6 ridges on your fruit. The pomegranate will naturally separate along these ridges, making it easier to cut and open the fruit.Tip: If you\u2019re having trouble finding the ridges, you can simply cut around the width of the pomegranate instead. It\u2019ll be more difficult to pull apart, but you should still be able to open it up."
