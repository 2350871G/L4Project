Avoid using wooden or plastic hooks. The tension of the wires will dent and deform the wood needles and the plastic needles will break very easily. Select Aluminum or steel needle that is smooth and have a thicker flat section near the grips. You will use this part of your needles to check and maintain an uniform size for your loops."

It is best to use one single length of wire for the entire piece. Don't waste excess wire or end up cutting the length of wire too short to complete your piece."
