Pre-colored putty is also sold separately, but you have to match it with the color of your floor. The pre-dyed putty often comes in a squeezable container that makes it easier to apply. Check for repair kits and putty online or at your local home improvement store. Putty is better than pencil and marker fillers for fixing moderate scratches and gouges.

Wipe out as much dirt as possible with a clean microfiber cloth, then scrub the remainder with soap mixed into a bucket of hot water. Try using 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of a mild dish detergent or baby shampoo to avoid damaging the laminate. Let the floor dry completely when you\u2019re done or wipe it dry with another clean cloth.

With a kit, all you have to do is place some of the putty in a small container, add a few drops of dye, then stir it it with a putty knife. Pre-dyed putty is already colored, but you can add additional coloring to it so it better matches your floor. If you don\u2019t have dyes, try using acrylic or oil-based paint from an art supply store. Use dyes sparingly. Add a few drops at a time, mixing the putty to see what color you get. Then, add more if you need to darken the putty."

          "description":"Use a plastic knife since a metal one might cause additional scratches on your floor. To apply the putty, pick some of it up with the edge of the knife, then hold the knife at about a 45-degree angle to the floor. Rub the knife over the scratch a few times, getting more putty as needed to fill the entire scratch. When you\u2019re done, turn the knife on its side and scrape it across the scratch to level out the putty. Run the knife over the scratch in a few different directions. Doing this ensures the putty applies as evenly as possible. Fresh putty is very easy to clean up, so don\u2019t worry about overfilling the scratch. You are better off overfilling the scratch a little bit to ensure you use enough putty to fill it."

          "description":"The putty begins solidifying within 30 minutes, so take care of anything outside of the scratch as soon as possible. Carefully rub the area around the scratch with a paper towel to blend it in with the rest of the floor. If the putty begins hardening before you\u2019re done, dip the paper towel in some of the soap and warm water you used to clean the floor. Old wood putty is difficult to remove. Once the putty hardens, it has to be scraped off with tools like a chisel and scraper blade."

          "description":"Wax sticks are similar to filler pencils and markers except they are solid blocks that take a little more effort to apply. Kits typically include different colors of wax blocks you have to mix together to match your floor color. They also include a handheld burn-in knife or a similar applicator that melts the wax. If you buy your own wax filler sticks, make sure you get one that matches your floor color. Kits and filler sticks are available online as well as many home improvement stores. If you\u2019re getting separate filler sticks, look for products called burn-in sticks. Any wax advertised for use on wood also works on laminate floors. If you can\u2019t find the exact color of wax you need, get the closest colors. Get a lighter brown and a darker brown, for instance, to mix to the shade you need. Wax sticks are the best way to fill in deeper scratches and gouges, especially if you can\u2019t find a putty in the right shade you need. It is harder to apply than a putty, but you have more of an opportunity to adjust the filler\u2019s coloring."

          "description":"The wax comes in a solid bar that melts only after you heat it. Take some of the wrapping off of each bar you plan on using to fill in the scratch. Then, turn on the burn-in knife if you have one. If you don\u2019t have a melter, find an alternative way to melt the wax, such as by warming up a knife or by holding a butane lighter or torch close to it. Another way to fill in gaps in the floor is by using a crayon. Remove the wrapper, then melt it in the microwave. Rub the melted wax over the gaps for an easier but slightly less effective way of repairing scratches."

          "headline":"Rub the melted wax into the scratch using the knife.",
          "description":"Press the burn-in knife against the wax bar to melt a little bit of it, just enough to cover the tip. After you have some wax, press the knife\u2019s tip down on the scratch. Smear the wax across the scratch to fill it. Keep applying more wax as needed to fill in the damaged area. If you need to color match the wax to your floor, start with the lightest color and work up to the darkest. Apply the wax a little bit at a time to get it to the color you desire. You can mix different colors of wax directly in the crack. If you wish to do a test run first, mix the wax in a small container or on a scrap piece of paper, then move it into the scratch."

If you don\u2019t have this, get something solid, such as a stiff card or a putty knife. After waiting about 30 seconds for the wax to cool, hold your scraper on its side and brush it across the wax to remove the excess. Try to flatten out the scratched area as much as possible. Leaving a little overflow is okay, since you can always remove the excess wax before it dries."
