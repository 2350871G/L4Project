The same goes if you have lannon countertops. The goal is to keep grime, dust, or debris from accumulating on the surface of the stone. Be careful vacuuming if you have lannon floors. Only use a vacuum designed for hardwood or stone flooring, as it will be less likely to leave scratch marks behind."

As soon as you notice a spot, grab a microfiber cloth and wipe it up. Then, wet down a paper towel with water and run it over the area of the spill."

When the water in the bucket gets murky, empty it out and replace it with clean solution. If there are areas that you can\u2019t reach, try pouring the solution into a bottle.
