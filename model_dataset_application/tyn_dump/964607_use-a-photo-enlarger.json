    "For example, if 8 seconds is too bright and 16 seconds is too dark, try making a test strip with five sections between 8 and 16 seconds.",
    "To do this, expose the whole paper for 8 seconds, then expose each of the next 4 sections for 2 seconds.",
    "Your new test strip will then display exposures of 8 seconds, 10 seconds, 12 seconds, 14 seconds, and 16 seconds.",
    "Depending on the image, you may want to try 5-second intervals instead.",
    "Enlarging and Developing Your Final Print Turn the lights off again.",
    "Do this before you remove the photo paper for your final print so it\u2019s not ruined by the light.",
    "If it\u2019s not still on, turn the red safety light on so you can see what you\u2019re doing.",
    "Place a full sheet of photo paper on the projection plane.",
    "Lift up the top of the frame, insert the paper, and close the frame.",
    "Then, place the projection plane on the base of the enlarger.",
    "Expose the paper to light using your desired exposure time.",
    "Set the exposure time on the timer using the dial.",
    "Then, make sure the projected image is lined up with the photo paper, and press the start button on the timer.",
    "For example, if you liked the image quality for 16 seconds of exposure time on the test strip, you\u2019d set the timer to 16 seconds.",
    "Develop your final print.",
    "Repeat the developing process that you used for the test strip.",
    "Start with the development bath for 60 seconds, then dip the paper in the stop bath for 30 seconds.",
    "Finally, transfer the paper to the fix bath for 30 seconds before rinsing it off with water.",
    "When you\u2019re finished developing your final print, hang it up to dry in the darkroom."
