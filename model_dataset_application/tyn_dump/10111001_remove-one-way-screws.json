One-ways screws come in sizes from #6 to #14, so you\u2019ll need to use the corresponding size regular screwdriver to loosen it. Most screwdrivers will have their size number printed on the handle.

Twist the small knob at the base of 1 of the pliers\u2019 arms until the pliers are set to lock at the exact diameter of the screw head. Then, squeeze down on the handle so that the pliers clamp shut around the screw head. Purchase locking pliers at a local hardware store. These pliers are called \u201clocking\u201d because one of the arms contains a knob which, when turned, sets how far the pliers can open. The other arm contains a bar that, when clenched against the arm of the pliers, will \u201clock\u201d the head of the pliers in place."

Removing the Screws with a Extractor Tool Purchase a one-way screw extractor tool from a hardware store. Removal tools look like a typical screwdriver but have 2 steel pins located at their end.

Drill counterclockwise into the center of the one-way screw. Position the center of the drill bit over the middle of the screw head, and begin drilling straight into the screw.
