Make sure that the water is draining out the bottom of the colander and that the strawberries don\u2019t soak for long, as this can cause them to start to lose their flavor. If you are using organic strawberries, you may want to make an organic fruit wash to ensure that the strawberries are very clean.

    "Unlike strawberries frozen in simple syrup, sugar strawberries have less liquid and won\u2019t make your cake batter runny.",
    "Keeping Frozen Strawberries in Simple Syrup Make the simple syrup with sugar and water.",
    "To make an easy homemade simple syrup, mix equal parts water and white granulated sugar in a saucepan.",
    "Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn the heat down to a simmer.",
    "Let the mixture simmer for 3 to 5 minutes until the sugar is dissolved, stirring occasionally with a whisk or spoon.",
    "Then, remove the saucepan from heat to let the simple syrup cool to room temperature.",
    "To figure out how much simple syrup to make, measure the amount of strawberries.",
    "For every 2 cups (470 mL) of strawberries, you will need \u20442 cup (120 mL) of simple syrup.",
    "Therefore, if you have 8 cups (1,900 mL) of strawberries, make 2 cups (470 mL) of simple syrup.",
    "If you make simple syrup ahead of time, you can keep it fresh in the refrigerator for several weeks.",
    "Chill the simple syrup in the refrigerator for 4 hours.",
    "Once the simple syrup has cooled to room temperature, transfer it into a glass jar or bottle.",
    "Place the jar or bottle in the refrigerator for about 4 hours, or until the syrup is completely chilled.",
    "Wash the strawberries under cold running water.",
    "While the simple syrup is cooling in the refrigerator, wash the strawberries by putting them in a strainer and rinsing them under cold running water.",
    "Make sure that the water is draining out the bottom of the colander and that the strawberries don\u2019t soak for long \u2013 this can make them start to lose their flavor.",
    "If you are using organic strawberries, you may want to make an organic fruit wash to ensure that the strawberries are very clean.",
    "Use a knife or straw to hull the strawberries.",
    "To hull with a knife, cut a circle around the hull (the leafy stem at the top) of one of the strawberries with a small paring knife.",
    "Angle the knife in towards the middle as you cut, then pull on the leaves with your fingers to pull out the hull.",
    "To hull with a straw, stick the straw through the small, pointed end of the strawberry and push through the strawberry until the straw pushes the hull off the other side.",
    "Repeat this process with either a knife or straw until all the strawberries are hulled.",
    "Slice or crush the strawberries (optional).",
    "Once the strawberries are washed and hulled, you can use a sharp knife to cut them into halves, quarters, or thin slices.",
    "If you want a more jam-like consistency, put the strawberries in a bowl and use a wooden spoon or potato masher to crush the strawberries up.",
    "If you want to leave the strawberries whole, you can skip this step.",
    "Crushing the strawberries in a bowl is a great option if you plan to use them as a mixer in a cocktail.",
    "Place the strawberries in a freezer-safe container with a lid.",
    "Once the strawberries are sliced, crushed, or left whole, use a measuring cup to scoop them into a large freezer-safe container.",
    "If you do not have a large container or want to make several individual batches, you can separate the strawberries into several smaller containers.",
    "Count the number of cups that you put in each container.",
    "Pour the chilled simple syrup over the strawberries.",
    "Remove the simple syrup from the refrigerator.",
    "Then, using a measuring cup, pour \u20442 cup (120 mL) of simple syrup for every 2 cups (470 mL) of strawberries until the container is full.",
    "The strawberries should be completely inundated in the syrup.",
    "If the strawberries are not all completely covered by the syrup, add more until all are submerged in the liquid.",
    "Add a flavor extract for a more interesting taste (optional).",
    "To add a subtle extra flavor to your strawberries, add about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of an additional flavor extract, such as orange zest or vanilla, to every 2 cups (470 mL) of strawberries in simple syrup.",
    "The strawberries will absorb the extract as they freeze, giving them a more unique and interesting flavor later on.",
    "You can also add spices if you choose.",
    "Cinnamon and cardamom, for example, taste great on strawberries frozen in simple syrup.",
    "Store the strawberries in the freezer for up to 6 months.",
    "Once the containers are full and you\u2019ve added any additional flavors, tightly seal the top(s) back on the container(s).",
    "Place the simple syrup strawberries in the freezer to freeze for future use.",
    "Storing them in sugary liquid helps the strawberries keep their color and shape while absorbing some of the sweetness from the simple syrup.",
    "When you decide to use the simple syrup frozen strawberries, thaw them on the counter at room temperature for about 4 hours."
