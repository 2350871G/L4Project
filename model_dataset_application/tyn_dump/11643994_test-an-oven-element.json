You cannot test a heating element safely without removing it, and you cannot remove it when the oven is hot or on. If you were just using the oven, turn the oven off and wait 30-60 minutes for the oven to cool. Then, pull it out from the wall and unplug it. You may seriously injure yourself if you test an oven element while the oven is on. If your oven is fixed into the wall, flip the appropriate fuse on your fuse box to turn the breakers for the room off. While oven elements look different, they are almost always a single loop of metal. A continuity test sends an electrical signal down one end of the coil and assesses how accurately and successfully the signal reaches the other end of the coil."

Then, look at the very bottom of the oven and look for a 0.5\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm) thick metal coil that loops around the bottom of the oven. This is your main heating element. Next, look at the roof of your oven\u2019s interior. If you have a broiler, there will be a second coil attached to the top of the oven. Heating elements come in different shapes and sizes, but the overall steps are the same regardless of your make or model. The heating element is black or gray when the oven is off.

Next, gently pull the element out 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310.2 cm) to expose the element\u2019s terminals, which are the 2 pieces of metal that are connected to 2 wires. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to gently slide the metal brackets at the end of each wire out of the element\u2019s terminals. Lift your element out of the oven.Warning: Be careful to not let the wires slide back inside of the frame of the oven. If this happens, you\u2019ll have to remove the back door of your oven and retrieve these wires. To do this, turn the oven around and remove every screw securing the bottom panel with a screwdriver. Then, carefully slide the panel down a little to remove it. Most ovens have 2 heating elements\u2014one on top for the broiler and one on the bottom for the oven. You can test either element, but you must remove it from the appliance. Elements may be shaped differently from model to model, but the overall process is the same for every element. Some elements have more than 1 screw on the plate holding the terminals in place."

If the number on your screen is lower than 1.0, your wires are functioning correctly. If the number is higher than 1.0, try cleaning the terminals on your wires and testing again.

However, some signal is often lost from one end to the other, and this is nothing to worry about so long as the loss is less than 50 ohms. If the number is higher than 50 ohms, or you see a single 1 with no decimal on the left side of your screen, your element is broken and needs to be replaced. Standard continuity readings come in the form of a double-digit number with a decimal point. A reading of 1 with no decimal point on the left side of your screen means that there is no signal whatsoever. On some multimeters, it means that the reading is so high, it can\u2019t be displayed on your screen. If the continuity is under 50 ohms and your oven still isn\u2019t heating properly, the problem is not the heating element itself."
