The heavy pot will help the moisture drain from the tofu. Then, put a plate on top of the pot. Let the tofu drain for 30 minutes. The tofu should be properly drained after 30 minutes. If not, you can gently squeeze the excess moisture out of the tofu with your hand. You can also blot the tofu with a paper towel.
