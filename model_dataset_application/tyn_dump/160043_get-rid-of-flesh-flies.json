          "description":"Flesh flies get their name because they lay their eggs inside decaying plant and animal material. They also love garbage. When you first spot the flies, walk towards them. By finding where the majority of flies gather, you may end up finding the source of the infestation. Figuring out where most of the flies are helps narrow down your search. If you see lots of big flies or white maggots in a single spot, you know where to look for the cause. Flesh flies are relatively harmless and don\u2019t bite people, so you don\u2019t need to worry about getting attacked by them while you search."

          "description":"Sometimes flesh flies appear on a wall all at once. When this happens, the source of the infestation is near the wall. Search the area, including underneath furniture. If you don\u2019t see anything unusual, the problem may be inside the wall. Flesh flies will find animals like rats, squirrels, and birds that wander into your home. Flesh flies often reach animal carcasses while they are fresh. The animal begins stinking after about 3 days. You can locate it by detecting its smell through the wall, then dispose of it after enclosing it in a garbage bag. Animals entering your home may also end up in the ceiling or behind light fixtures. Search around for off-putting odors or other animal tracks. If you have a pet cat that goes outdoors, search areas near where your cat comes indoors. Sometimes cats bring presents that attract flesh flies."

They often feed on raw meat but will infest almost any food you throw away. Check the garbage areas for large numbers of flies to identify the problem. Look underneath garbage bins for anything unusual. Check for animal carcasses and flesh flies. If you see nothing but flies, then you know the garbage is the problem."

Look around for animal droppings or litter. If you have a compost pile, inspect it for flies. Any sort of organic material close to your home is a problem. Flesh fly larvae don\u2019t crawl very far, but sometimes they slip inside buildings."

Dispose of it with the rest of your trash during trash removal day or take it to a landfill. Burying or burning waste also stops flies from reaching your home. Inspect waste first for signs of flies and maggots. Waste, especially animal droppings, is the main food source for flesh flies. To reduce the chances of attracting flesh flies, discourage stray animals from visiting your home. Hide food sources and install barriers to make your yard less appealing."

The heat inside the compost pile kills most maggots before they grow. If you notice flies around a compost pile, try covering it with black plastic sheeting from a hardware store. The plastic causes the compost to heat up more, eliminating flies before they escape."

Use it in place of an insecticide or to take care of any stragglers left after spraying the area. Keep in mind that flies are pretty quick and you may not spot them all right away.

After you\u2019re done, throw away the bag without opening it. Any flies that are still alive get mixed in with the dust in the bag and die quickly. Still, replace the bag to ensure none of them can escape. This doesn\u2019t work well with bagless vacuums unless you are willing to wait. Wait for up to 7 days before emptying the vacuum to ensure the flies are all dead."

Cover the trash can with a tightly-fitting lid to prevent flies and other animals from getting into it. Trash is a big source of flesh flies, so secure anything you throw away.
