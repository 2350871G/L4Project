Host events in the community or local businesses. Contact recreation centers like bowling alleys or miniature golf courses in your area. Publicize your event through local media. Obtain your resources. People in colonial times made use of whatever resources were available. The American Association of School Libraries offers suggestions on how to acquire the materials needed to set up a space:Make a list of items you need. Ask local businesses and community organizations to provide space for collection boxes. Look for vintage items in thrift stores. Find sources of funding. Contact local businesses for donations. Publicize your sponsors' donations. Apply for a grant. Search for grants online. A list of available grants can be found at https://www.grants.gov/web/grants\n\nWrite a cover letter outlining your project. Fill out all the necessary paperwork. Start making things. The project possibilities are endless, but a few ideas for basic 18th-century projects can get you started. Making Quilt Squares Create your quilt background with felt squares. Select the color you want for your background. Cut the squares to the desired size. 12\"x12\" is a recommended for most projects, but you can use any size that suits your project. Decorate your squares using one or more of the techniques outlined below. Decorate your squares with ready-made appliques. Shop in dollar stores and craft stores for decorative appliques. Attach appliques to background felt with fabric glue, or use adhesive-backed appliques. Create designs to decorate your squares. Create your own designs or search for quilt square patterns. There are hundreds of free public domain patterns online. Print out the patterns and trace them onto fabric. Cut out designs and attach to the felt backing by gluing or stitching. Attach scraps of fabric to the felt squares for a \"crazy quilt\" effect. Cut fabric in random geometric shapes and sizes. Lay fabric shapes side by side until the felt base square is covered. Pin or glue shapes in place. Stitch pinned shapes onto the base square. Display your quilt square. Frame and display individual squares, or sew or glue the squares to a backing fabric to create a quilt. Making a Branch Loom Find a sturdy Y-shaped branch.  Clean off the dead leaves and remove all bark from the branch.  Tie the end of the warp (lengthwise string) to the middle of the branch\u2019s V.  Wind the warp string around the V until you reach the desired length.  Thread the string for the weft (crosswise string) into a large needle.  Using the needle, weave the weft string by going over and under the warp string. Change the yarn you are using for weaving by tying another yarn to the end and threading it through the needle. Tie off your yarn when you are done and trim any loose ends with scissors.  Creating a Paper Whirligig Take a paper plate and color it with crayons, pencils, or paint. Using paint or ink is more consistent with 18th century art. Cut the plate in a spiral pattern.  Punch a hole in the center of the plate.  Tie the string in the hole so the toy can move freely.  Tie the whirligig to a tree branch or drag it along like a kite.  Creating a Silhouette Tape a piece of white paper on the wall.  Have the subject of the picture sit so the beam of the flashlight or candle casts their shadow in profile on the paper.  Trace the outline of the subject's shadow. Cut the profile from the white paper. Mount the profile for display. Glue the profile to black construction paper for a cameo effect, or glue a piece of black paper to the cut-out profile for a shadow effect. Making a \"Silver Plate\" Tray Use a Styrofoam tray as the base of your silver plate tray. Trays can be obtained online, or you can clean and recycle meat trays. Squirt some white glue in a paper plate.  Drag pieces of string through the glue.  Place string on the Styrofoam tray to make designs.  Cover the tray with aluminum foil. Smooth the foil so the designs underneath are visible. Fold the foil around the the back of the tray and secure it by gluing. Press (engrave) designs into the foil with a toothpick being careful not to tear the foil.  Making a Pierced Tin Plate Tape a disposable aluminum pan or pie plate to your work surface.  Create or download a pattern for piercing the plate.  Tape the pattern to the plate.  \"Draw\" the pattern with by piercing through the plate with a pointed instrument such as a needle or pushpin.  Use indelible markers to add color to the plate, if desired.  Making a Tin Candle Holder Wash and remove labels from an empty can. Any size will work fine. Cat food and soup cans work well. File any sharp edges to prevent cuts.  Create a design template. Create an original design or download one from the Internet. Cut a strip of paper long enough to go around the can. Remove the paper from the can. Draw your design. Use a marker to draw the design as a series of dots. Fill the can with water and freeze to prevent the can from collapsing. Be sure to protect your hands when handling the frozen can. Pound your design into the can. Tape the design template around the can. Secure the can in a vise or other tool. Use a hammer and nail to punch holes into the can. Remove the can from the vise. Illuminate the lantern with a candle. ",
