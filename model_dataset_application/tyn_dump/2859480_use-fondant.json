If you\u2019re using store bought fondant, check the packaging to see approximately how long you should knead the icing. When the fondant is ready, it will be warm and easy to stretch.

Make the sheet around \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) thick so that it won\u2019t tear or crack when you handle it. Remember to flip the fondant over and roll both sides to ensure that it\u2019s smooth. If you want to ensure that your fondant is an even width, use a spacer attachment on your rolling pin, or set up spacer bars on your workspace before you begin rolling it out. These will keep your rolling pin at a level height and prevent dents and dips in the icing."

Try to wrap it around the rolling pin slightly, if possible, so that it doesn\u2019t rip or wrinkle. Hold the rolling pin with one hand and support the hanging edges of the fondant with the other. Using a rolling pin will make applying the fondant to the cake easier. If you don\u2019t have a rolling pin available, you can use any smooth, cylindrical object, like a tall vase or cup."

Then, gently pull the fondant away from the sides of the cake, and use your hands to smooth it around the sides so that there are no creases or ridges. Remember to go around the sides of the cake with the smoothing tool to make sure everything is flat. Be careful not to pull too hard on the fondant, or it can rip. Stretch the fondant gently so that you can carefully smooth it down without creasing."

Even if your cake already has a crumb coating of icing or other decorations, this will help the fondant stay in place for as long as you need.
