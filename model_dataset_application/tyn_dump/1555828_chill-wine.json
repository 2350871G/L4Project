Chilling Wine in an Ice Bucket Use this method for last minute chilling. This method can cool a red wine to serving temperature in two minutes, and even a light-bodied, low-alcohol white wine can be properly chilled in five to ten minutes. Add ice to a bucket or large bowl. If you are using a wine bucket, fill it about \u2154 full of ice. For a larger bucket, fill it to approximately \u2154 the height of the wine bottle. Pour water to the top of the ice level. Pour the coldest water you have access to into the bucket, until it is level with the ice. Mix in a handful of salt.

Smaller grains of salt tend to be more effective. Rock salt will work, but may have a less noticeable effect. Submerge the bottle. Lower the wine bottle upright into the water. This should cause the ice water to rise above the shoulder of the wine bottle. Rotate the bottle. Spin the neck of the bottle with your hands while waiting for the wine to chill. The movement will cause the wine inside to move around in the bottle, so more of the warm wine comes into contact with the chilled bottle, speeding up the process slightly. Dry before serving. Remove the bottle when it reaches your preferred temperature, or after approximately 2 minutes for red and 7 minutes for white wine. Remove the bottle and dry it with a cloth or paper towel. Serve immediately. Storing Wine Store horizontally, in a cool, dark place. Always keep your wines in an area under 70\u00baF (21\u00baC) and away from direct sunlight.
