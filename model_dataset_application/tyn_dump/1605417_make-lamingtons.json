Once the butter is smooth, add 1 cup (200 g) of granulated sugar and beat the mixture on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes.Did You Know? Creaming the butter with sugar will create a pale, fluffy mixture that's full of air. This will make the basis for a light cake batter. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally. If you don't have a mixer, use a wooden spoon to cream the butter and sugar."

  "text":" Mixing the Cake Batter Preheat the oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and grease a baking pan. Get out an 8 in (20 cm) square pan and spray it with baking spray.

Making the chocolate icing in the double boiler ensures that the icing remains smooth and doesn't crystallize. Melt the chocolate, butter, and milk in the bowl.
