Making Hearty Cauliflower Soup Prepare the vegetables. Rinse the cauliflower, cut off the stem and leaves, then chop it into florets. Rinse the carrot, cut off the leaves, then shred it. Lastly, rinse off the celery, then chop it into \u00bc to \u00bd-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) pieces. Put the vegetables into a large saucepan, then add the water and bouillon. Give everything a stir to combine. You can use either chicken or vegetable bouillon. Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer it for 12 to 15 minutes. Turn the heat up to medium or medium-high, and let the water come to a boil. As soon as it starts to boil, reduce the heat to low, then let the water simmer for 12 to 15 minutes. You are ready for the next step when the vegetables turn tender. Do not pour the water out. You will be using this as part of your soup base. Melt the butter in a separate saucepan. Make sure that the saucepan is large enough to hold the rest of your ingredients, including the milk. Stir the butter occasionally with a rubber spatula to help it melt. Stir in the flour, salt, and pepper. Use a whisk or fork to mix in the flour so that it doesn't clump up too much. You can vary the amounts of salt and pepper to suit your personal tastes. Slowly pour in the milk while stirring with a whisk. 2% milk is recommended for this recipe, but you can use whole milk for a richer soup, or fat-free milk for a lighter one. Be sure to stir the mixture well so that the butter and flour mix in evenly. Boil over medium heat for 2 minutes. Turn the heat up to medium, then wait for the mixture to boil. Let it boil for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. You are ready for the next step when the mixture thickens. Reduce the heat, then stir in the Cheddar cheese. Turn the heat down to low, then add the cheese. Stir the mixture with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until the cheese has melted and mixed evenly into the milk. Slowly stir the milk mixture into the vegetable mixture. Use a whisk to blend the two mixtures together. Keep stirring until everything is evenly combined. Serve the soup while it is still hot. You can serve it as is, or you can garnish it with some croutons. Making Parmesan Cauliflower Soup Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Pour 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of extra-virgin olive oil into a large saucepan. Turn the heat to medium, then wait for the olive oil to get hot. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until they turn soft, about 5 minutes. If you have not done so already, chop 1 small onion, and mince 2 cloves of garlic. Add both to the hot oil, and cook them until they become soft. Stir them occasionally with a rubber spatula so that they don't brown. Add the cauliflower and the chicken stock.

Simmer the mixture, covered, for about 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, and let the mixture simmer for about 15 minutes.
