However, baby back ribs and spare ribs are the easiest to cook. You can cook beef back ribs the same way you cook pork ribs. However, if you want to cook beef short ribs, you'll need to spend much longer cooking them in the low-and-slow portion, as long as 6-8 hours. If your ribs are frozen, thaw them in the refrigerator overnight."

You can use a combination of ingredients, such as soy sauce, chicken broth, worcestershire sauce, vinegar, lemon, lime sugar, cumin, garlic, onion powder, chile powder, oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. For a simple marinade, try 0.75 cups (180 mL) of chicken broth, 0.75 cups (180 mL) of soy sauce, 0.5 cup (100 g) of sugar, 6 tablespoons (89 mL) of apple cider vinegar, and 6 tablespoons (89 mL) of olive oil. Add 3 cloves of minced garlic, and stir to combine. Pour 2/3 of the marinade over the meat in a shallow dish and let it sit overnight, flipping the meat occasionally. Some cooks swear by marinades, while others prefer dry rubs. The truth is, you can use both when cooking ribs. The marinade will soak into the main part of the meat, making it flavorful and juicy, while the dry rub will work on the outside of the meat. If you don't have time to marinate the ribs overnight, give them at least a couple of hours."

Combine the ingredients, and use your hands to rub it on the meat before you start cooking it. For an easy rub, try 3 parts kosher salt, 2 parts chili powder, 2 parts dark brown sugar, 2 parts paprika, 1 part garlic powder, and 1 part ground mustard. A dash of black pepper would also be tasty."
