Drill your hole roughly 8 inches (20 cm) to 10 inches (25 cm) deep. If your stump is shorter than 8 inches (20 cm), just drill far enough down so that you reach the roots. Make sure you clear the debris out of the hole once you've finished drilling."

          "description":"Once you've drilled your hole in the center of the stump, continue to drill holes across the top, leaving roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each hole you drill. Like with your center hole, each hole should be 8 inches (20 cm) to 10 inches (25 cm) deep. If your stump is shorter than this, make sure your holes are at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep. Clear the debris out of each hole once you're finished drilling."

          "description":"If the sides of the stump are still visible after the tree was cut down, drill holes into the stump around its perimeter to allow the stump to catch fire and burn more easily. As you did with the holes drilled from the top of the stump, leave roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each hole you drill along the stump's perimeter. Be sure to drill these holes so that they connect to the holes you drilled from the top down. The more air that is able to circulate throughout the stump, the easier it will be to burn it."

For maximum protection, wear protective clothing such as gloves, a mask, and protective goggles when working with potassium nitrate. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after handling potassium nitrate. Store it in a well-ventilated place and in a tightly closed container when you're not using it. Charcoal can also be used in place of potassium nitrate. You might also opt to use kerosene to make your stump more flammable. However, you'll have to leave the stump for a week to soak up the kerosene before lighting it."

Continue pouring water until all the potassium nitrate has dissolved. You can also place funnels in each hole and pour water directly from the bucket into the funnels. The water will help to spread the nitrate throughout the stump and make the entire structure more flammable. You don't have to pour water into the stump if you opted for charcoal or kerosene instead of potassium nitrate."
