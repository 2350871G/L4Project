Primer is also useful when you are trying to paint over a dark color, or colors that are vibrant, which can sometimes show through paint-only applications. Use long, even, overlapping strokes when applying your primer to the planking. Prime from top to bottom to decrease the likelihood of drips and runs.

    "Insert your caulk into a caulk gun and apply it according to its directions.",
    "Generally, this involves cutting the tip off the applicator and pressing the applicator lever on the gun.",
    "Then, use your gun to fill in the gaps between planks and between planks and the ceiling/wall.",
    "Caulking the gaps will give a more finished look to your wall.",
    "What's more, you can use a paint-able caulk, so when you paint the color of your accent planking uniform.",
    "After caulk hardens, it retains some flexibility.",
    "This is great for you planking, which may warp or swell in humid weather.",
    "The caulk will flex with the planks, preventing them from popping free or coming loose.",
    "Prime your accent planking before painting.",
    "Many kinds of planking are very absorbent.",
    "By using two to three layers of primer, you'll not only have a more chip resistant finish, but you'll also use less paint over the course of this project, saving you money.",
    "Primer is also useful when you are trying to paint over a dark color, or colors that are vibrant, which can sometimes show through paint-only applications.",
    "Use long, even, overlapping strokes when applying your primer to the planking.",
    "Prime from top to bottom to decrease the likelihood of drips and runs.",
    "Once you are finished priming your first coat, touch up drips, runs, and puddling so the coat is even.",
    "Wait for the primer to dry, then add coats until you have at least two, but no more than five.",
    "Paint your accent planking.",
    "Follow the directions on your paint for best results.",
    "In most cases, this will involve using a paint stirrer to mix the paint thoroughly and dipping a clean brush into it.",
    "Wipe excess paint on the inside lip of the can, then:\nApply the paint from the top row of planks down.",
    "Use long, even, overlapping strokes, much as you did for the primer.",
    "When finished with your first coat, check for runs, drips, and puddling.",
    "Each coat should be even and smooth.",
    "Use your paint brush to touch up these spots.",
    "Allow the paint to dry according to its label instructions, then apply coats until you have no less than two but no more than five coats total."
