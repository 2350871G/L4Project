It has a marbled look, meaning there are more fat lines running through it. The flat cut is the part of the brisket that has less fat.

You'll be able to lift up a chunk of the meat to put seasoning in the middle. Finding the Grain of the Cooked Brisket Examine the meat to find the grain on a flat or point cut. Place the brisket on a cutting board to study the brisket. The grain is how the strands of muscle run through the meat. It's like a long series of rubber bands, and you'll see the lines in the meat. Check for the grain in 2 directions with a whole brisket. When the brisket is whole, the grain will run in different directions on the flat and point cut.

Slicing the Cooked Brisket Rest the cooked brisket for 20 minutes to 24 hours before slicing it. You should always let your meat rest at least 20 minutes after cooking to keep the juices in the meat. However, if you want very thin slices, wait until the next day when the brisket is cold to cut it. Use a long serrated knife for slicing the brisket. While you can use any sharp knife, a serrated knife (the kind with points along the edge) will work best. The small points help you slice through the brisket. Aim for a knife that is 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) long, which will allow you to slice more of the brisket at once. Use short strokes to go across your brisket against the grain.
