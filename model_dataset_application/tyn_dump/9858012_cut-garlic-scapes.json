Once you remove the scape, the plant will direct more of its resources to the bulb. The result is larger, more flavorful garlic cloves."

When stored properly, they should stay good for up to 3 weeks without losing their signature flavor or crunch. Alternatively, you can place the stalks in a glass of cool water (the way you would celery or carrots) and leave them out on the countertop if you plan on using them within a few days. For maximum freshness, be sure to change the water daily."

Shake off the excess water, then pat the scapes dry with a clean paper towel. If you\u2019re washing a lot of scapes at once, it may be easiest to do it in a colander. Don\u2019t attempt to clean scapes by soaking them. This can cause them to absorb too much water, diluting their flavor and leaving them mushy."

Toss both sections in the trash, or add them to your compost heap. You should be left with just the smooth, light green shaft. The top and bottom portions of the scape are tough and chewy, so it\u2019s best to just throw them away."

          "description":"Move the blade of your knife up and down along the length of the stalks with a smooth lever action, holding them steady with your free hand. It may be necessary to stop and reposition especially curved stalks as you go. Once sliced, your scapes will lend a burst of aromatic flavor to savory dishes in much the same way as scallions, leeks, or chives. The exact thickness of each slice will depend on your knife-handling skills and your intended use for the scapes. Toss a handful of sliced scapes into a stir fry or saut\u00e9, or sprinkle them onto a salad or loaded baked potato. They also go well in sauces and dips like salsa verde, guacamole, chimichurri, and pesto."

        {
          "headline":"Leave the scapes in larger pieces for more flavorful cooking.",
          "description":"Instead of aiming for a fine slice, cut the stalks into 1-2 inch (2.5-5 cm) sections roughly the same size as broken green beans. In this form, they\u2019ll be perfect for adding a deep, savory note to soups, stews, and marinades. If you don\u2019t intend to eat the scapes, leave the stalks a little longer so they\u2019ll be easy to pick out of the pot or pan once you\u2019re done cooking. Try adding chopped scapes to a vegetable medley, or steaming them and serving them on their own. When cooked, they have a crunchy texture not unlike asparagus, with a mild onion flavor."
