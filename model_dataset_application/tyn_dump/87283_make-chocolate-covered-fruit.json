  "text":" Using a Microwave Heat the chocolate for about 10 seconds in a microwave on High, or as suggested on the package. If not melted, stir, then heat for another ten seconds. If not melted enough, melt for another 10 seconds. Dip your fruit in the heated chocolate. Try to be quick, the chocolate hardens fast! Return to the heat to re-melt if the chocolate hardens too quickly. Place the chocolate covered delight on the waxed paper.  Repeat for all fruits.  Cover the cookie sheet with aluminum foil or plastic wrap.  Place the cookie sheet in your freezer. Alternatively, place in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Wait for a little while, an hour should be enough.  Enjoy!  Using a Double Boiler Melt the chocolate over the stove in the double boiler (bain marie).  Drop each piece of fruit straight into the melted chocolate. Use a dipping fork or an ordinary fork to turn the pieces over to coat them thoroughly. Lift out with the fork. To remove excess chocolate from the fork, tap it on the side of the bowl and draw the underside of the fork across the rim of the bowl. Lay each dipped piece of fruit on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper.  Leave to set. Place in the refrigerator if you want it to set faster or if the kitchen is hot. Serve. Place on a serving plate or inside a candy gift box. If giving as a gift, place each piece of fruit in individual sweet cases to preserve their quality. Let the recipient know that they need to be eaten quickly. Making Chocolate Covered Dried Apricots Melt the chocolate in a double boiler. If melting in the microwave, melt in 30-second bursts, then stir, then microwave again until melted. Add the shortening. Stir through thoroughly. Remove from the heat.  Dip the dried apricots. Either using your fingers to hold, or holding the apricots in tongs, dip into the melted chocolate to about halfway. Remove from the chocolate and lay each dipped apricot on a cookie sheet covered in wax paper.  Let the chocolate set. Then refrigerate for an hour or so to harden completely. Serve. Remove from the refrigerator. Arrange on a serving plate. To store, keep in an airtight container away from heat. Making Double Chocolate Dipped Fruit Prepare the fruits. Clean and chop as required. Strawberries can be washed by brushing with a moist pastry brush. All washed fruits must be well dried before dipping. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or wax paper.  Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler. Remove from the heat and cool to 29\u00baC/84\u00baF. Stir frequently. Dip each piece of fruit into the melted white chocolate. Dip about two thirds of the way only, aiming to cover only one half of the fruit piece. Let excess chocolate drip off before transferring to the lined baking sheet.  Place all white-chocolate dipped fruits into the refrigerator to chill for 20 minutes. Or until the chocolate sets. Melt the dark or plain milk chocolate. Remove from the heat and cool to 30\u00baC/86\u00baF. Take the white-chocolate dipped fruits out of the refrigerator. Dip each one in the melted dark or plain milk chocolate. Do this at an angle and aim for a balance that matches the white-dipped side, only on the other side of the fruit piece this time. Place on the baking sheet. Return to the refrigerator to set. Leave for 15 minutes or until set. Bring out of the refrigerator 15 minutes before serving. If it's dried fruit, it can stay out of the fridge; store in an airtight container.",
