Take several of these home and test for additional properties to help you decide. Also keep in mind that you can purchase formed laminate to fit your counter if you do not wish to do the sawing yourself. A matte finish will hide wear and tear better than a glossy laminate, which is easily scratched, but may require more cleaning. Laminates come in a whole spectrum from the most glossy to the most matte, so consider each chip by its appearance, and not its marketing. Test how well the laminate stands up to wear and tear by scratching it with a steak knife. If you're applying a thin laminate sheet, use 1/16\" (0.16 cm) thick laminate for flat work surfaces and 1/32\" (0.3 cm) sheets for vertical surfaces."

If your installation place is curved, you'll need to use a jigsaw or laminate router to make these finer adjustments. The cutting tool you used earlier will have trouble turning along a curve, resulting in laminate that won't fit. Installing the Formica Apply contact cement to the edge strip and the surface it will attach to (if applicable). If you are installing laminate on a countertop or other surface with edges, begin with the edge pieces. If you cut them from the laminate yourself, apply the contact cement with a brush or roller to both surfaces. Allow it to set until it feels tacky, according to the manufacturer's directions.

Troubleshooting and Additional Installations Before installing, scribe your countertop to adjust it if it won't fit. If your walls are not at right angles, place your countertop against the wall as closely as you can, then use a compass and sander to adjust the shape:\nCheck that the countertop is level using a plumb bob or level. Slide shims or wedges beneath the countertop to make it level if necessary. Hold the non-pencil end of the compass against the wall at the widest gap, and touch the pencil end against the countertop. Move the compass along the length of the wall to draw a line on your counter. Clamp the countertop onto a sawhorse or other secure position, then use a sander or block plane to level the countertop up to the pencil line. Your countertop should now fit snugly against the wall. Install angled edges of Formica using miter bolts and sealant. For L-shaped countertops, Formica typically comes precut with angles of either 45\u00ba or 22.5\u00ba. Attach these diagonal pieces together with miter bolts after aligning their front edge. Apply a bead of sealant or laminate caulk to ensure a waterproof corner. Do not over tighten the miter bolts. Only tighten enough to keep the pieces in place. Tap down one piece of laminate with a rubber mallet or shoe heel if the surface is not level across the diagonal. Consider whether to install a laminate backsplash. A backsplash is a vertical section of material above the countertop, which protects the wall from stains and other kitchen accidents. If your wall is drywall, you'll need to attach a particle board base before adhering the laminate. You could also consider installing a tile backsplash over your laminate counter. Apply a laminate backsplash the same way you applied your counter. Once it's aligned against the wall with contact cement, roll it flat and trim excess or uneven edges with a router. Cut holes for appliances. Always follow the appliance manufacturer's instructions to determine safe placement on your countertop. Use a jigsaw to cut out the hole, and file down the sharp edges afterward. Cover the edges of a rangetop cutout with two layers of heat-conductive aluminum tape to prevent the Formica from melting. Learn how to treat your Formica. Avoid placing hot objects onto the Formica or other laminate, as the material can melt. Use a cutting board rather than cutting directly onto it. Clean with a damp cloth and a mild household cleaner. Remove Formica carefully by prying it off the base.

    "Avoid placing hot objects onto the Formica or other laminate, as the material can melt.",
    "Use a cutting board rather than cutting directly onto it.",
    "Clean with a damp cloth and a mild household cleaner.",
    "Remove Formica carefully by prying it off the base.",
    "Always wear eye protection and ear plugs, as removing Formica is a loud, time consuming process that creates dust and sharp particles.",
    "Use the sharp end of a hammer or other prying tool to pull the Formica off the countertop in pieces.",
    "Use gloves when handling the sharp, broken Formica.",
    "Be careful not to dent the plywood or particle board base beneath the Formica if you wish to install a new countertop on top of it."
