The fat will melt during the cooking process, infusing your beef joint with moisture and lots of flavor. If your beef joint does not have a layer of fat on top, which is likely with a joint of silverside, ask the butcher to secure fat to the meat. Like beef fat, beef bones will also impart rich flavor to your meat. If you purchase a boneless beef joint from a butcher, you can ask for beef bones to tuck under the beef joint when cooking."

It\u2019s a lean cut of meat, which means it doesn\u2019t have much fat inside; but it does have a layer of fat on one side that melts during cooking, keeping the meat moist. It\u2019s ideal for roasting, but also cooks well braised as a pot roast, and in stews, casseroles and pies."

To keep this from happening to your silverside, it needs to be braised in liquid. You can also have it \u201cbarded,\u201d if buying from a butcher, which means thin layers of beef fat are placed on top of the silverside to keep it moist while cooking."

If your beef joint is a leaner cut, like topside or silverside, rub it with olive oil before seasoning. If it already has a layer of fat on top, you don\u2019t need to drizzle it with olive oil at all. Some people remove the layer of fat after roasting.

But they should be included when braising, since the vegetables will lend additional flavor to your beef joint during the slow cooking process. If you\u2019re roasting your beef joint and prefer to let the taste of the beef shine, simply cut a small onion in half to tuck under the meat. For an added depth of flavor, wash and chop 2 medium onions, 2 carrots, 2 sticks of celery, and a small bunch of herbs, such as fresh thyme, rosemary, bay or sage. Break apart 1 bulb of garlic into cloves. Don\u2019t worry about peeling them. You\u2019ll place the vegetables in the bottom of your cooking dish, and then sit the beef joint on top."

    "Set your timer for 20 minutes.",
    "When your timer goes off, turn down the temperature of the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
    "Watch your meat thermometer to determine when your beef joint is done.",
    "The temperature it reaches and the amount of time you let it cook depends on how well done you prefer your meat.",
    "If you\u2019d prefer your meat rare, with a bright red center, allow it to continue roasting for an additional 20 minutes per pound.",
    "Add an additional 15 minutes for medium rare, or an additional 30 minutes for well-done, to the total cooking time calculated for a rare roast.",
    "For rare, it must reach a temperature of 120 to 125\u00b0F.",
    "For medium rare it must reach 130 to 135\u00b0F.",
    "For medium, 140 to 145\u00b0F.",
    "For medium well, 150 to 155\u00b0F.",
    "For well done, 160\u00b0F and up.",
    "Because the temperature of meat can rise 5 to 10 degrees during rest time, take it out of the oven 5 degrees before it reaches the desired temperature of doneness.",
    "Baste the meat throughout cooking to keep your beef joint infused with flavor.",
    "At least three times during the cooking process take the meat out of the oven to baste.",
    "Make sure to close the oven door each time you do so to keep the oven hot.",
    "To baste the beef joint use a baster, which is a large plastic suction, to suck up the juices of the beef.",
    "Carefully squirt the hot liquid all over the beef.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a baster, you can use a large spoon.",
    "You may have to tip the roasting pan a little to scoop up the juices.",
    "When your beef joint has reached the desired temperature, take it out of the oven and allow it to rest.",
    "Lightly cover your roasted beef with foil paper and let it rest for at least 15 minutes and up to an hour before serving.",
    "As the meat relaxes, it will reabsorb its juices, ensuring your meat is juicy and full of flavor when served.",
    "Braising Beef Joint Preheat your oven to 320 \u00b0F (160 \u00b0C) and warm your casserole pot.",
    "While your beef joint reaches room temperature, set your oven to the appropriate temperature.",
    "Take out a large casserole pot and warm it over medium high heat.",
    "Brown your beef joint on all sides.",
    "When the meat is room temperature and your large casserole pot is hot, add a teaspoon of oil to the pot and brown your beef joint for about 3 to 4 minutes per side.",
    "Remove it from the pot once all sides are browned.",
    "Sautee your vegetables.",
    "Add the chopped onions to the pot and allow them to cook for 2-3 minutes.",
    "Sprinkle with salt and pepper to draw out the onion\u2019s juices, and stir to keep the onions from sticking to the bottom of the pan.",
    "Then add the rest of your vegetables, garlic and herbs.",
    "Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and let the vegetables cook for 4-5 minutes.",
    "Add broth.",
    "Add 3 cups of either chicken or beef broth to the pot and stir.",
    "Taste the liquid to see if it needs additional salt and pepper.",
    "You\u2019ll want to make sure your broth has enough salt because without it your roast will lose flavor.",
    "The broth will keep your beef joint moist while cooking.",
    "Place your beef joint on top of the vegetables.",
    "To ensure your meat is cooked to your desired level of doneness, insert a meat thermometer directly into the center.",
    "Don\u2019t let the thermometer touch bone.",
    "Then cover with a top.",
    "Put the covered casserole pot in the oven and set a timer for 30 minutes.",
    "After 30 minutes reduce the oven heat to 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C), and set a timer to allow the beef joint to cook for an hour and a half.",
    "When your beef joint is 5 degrees away from the desired temperature of doneness, remove it from the oven.",
    "Check your thermometer to see if your beef joint is close to the temperature of your desired level of doneness.",
    "For rare, it must reach a temperature of 120 to 125\u00b0F.",
    "For medium rare, 130 to 135\u00b0F.",
    "For medium, 140 to 145\u00b0F.",
    "For medium well, 150 to 155\u00b0F.",
    "And for well done, 160\u00b0F and up.",
    "Let it rest.",
    "As your beef joint rests, its temperature will increase 5 to 10 degrees.",
    "Cover it loosely with foil paper, and allow it to rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving."
