          "description":"Since the pasta needs lots of room to move around as it cooks, use a big pot. For example, if you'll be cooking a 1 pound (450 g) box of pasta, get out a pot that's at least 4 US quarts (3.8 L) in size. Then, pour in enough water to come 2/3 up the side of the pot. If you use a pot that's too small, your pasta is more likely to clump together as it cooks."

You'll know the water is boiling when you see steam escaping from under the lid.Tip Although you will be adding salt to the pasta water, don't add it before the water begins to boil. This can discolor your pot or corrode its surface. Covering the pot with a lid will make the water boil faster."

        {
          "headline":"Add salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta to the boiling water.",
          "description":"Once the water boils vigorously, remove the lid and add 1 tablespoon (17 g) of salt and 1 pound (450 g) of pasta. If you're cooking long noodles, such as spaghetti, that don't fit in the pot, wait about 30 seconds and then push them into the water using a spoon or pasta fork.Tip: You can easily halve or quarter the amount of pasta you wish to cook. If you cook 4 ounces (110 g) of pasta, use a 2 to 3 US quarts (1.9 to 2.8 L) sized pot. The salt will season the noodles as they cook, which will give you flavorful pasta. If you're unsure how many servings of pasta to cook, check the side of the box for recommended serving sizes."

Then, check the pasta package for a recommended cooking time and set a timer for the minimum time that's suggested. For example, if the box says to cook the noodles for 7 to 9 minutes, set a timer for 7 minutes. Thin pasta, such as angel hair, will cook faster than thick or long noodles, such as fettuccine or penne, which take closer to 8 or 9 minutes."
