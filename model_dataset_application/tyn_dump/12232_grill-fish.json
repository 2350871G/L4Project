The intense heat will cause any debris to break down and dissolve, starting the cleaning process for you. This also minimizes sticking. At its highest heat, this should only take about 10-15 minutes. \"Blasting the heat\" is another way of saying very, very hot. We're talking around 550\u00b0F (288\u00b0C) here. So, obviously, cover your grill while this process is going on. The heat will sear the fish initially, sealing it. If you throw it on a warm grill, it'll stick. If you're using a charcoal grill, those babies need to be gray, not black."

Fold a couple of sheets of paper towels into a small square or pad. Grasping the paper towels with tongs, dip the paper towels in oil (vegetable or olive) and rub over the bars of the grate. Continue to wipe the grate with the oiled paper towels until the grate is somewhat glossy. Plan on doing this about 5 times. It's a good idea to re-dip the paper towels in oil for each application."

          "description":"When choosing a fish for grilling, you first want to consider how hearty it is -\u2014 how well can it stand up to the torture of a live fire. Flaky or delicate fish like flounder or sole won't cut it here. You want thicker fillets or steaks of more sturdy contenders such as:\nHalibut\nTuna\nSwordfish\nHaddock\nSalmon\nMahi-mahi\nGrouper\nIf you do opt for a delicate fish, you'll be better of with putting it in aluminum foil or using a grilling basket -- or else you risk your meat falling through the grill to the flames. Of course, there's always the option of taking a whole fish and filleting it yourself."

        {
          "headline":"Cut it up into smaller portions.",
          "description":"Not only will it be easier to manage on the grill but you can ensure the fish cooks up evenly -- the skinnier tail end doesn't need to cook as long as the thicker part of the fillet. Cut your fish into portions that have an even thickness to ensure you don't have dry parts and/or undercooked parts all on one portion."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Season or marinate the fish.",
          "description":"If you have a marinade you've been dying to try, go for it. Just make sure to keep the fish in the marinade for no longer than 30 minutes -- both salty or sugary marinades have a negative effect on taste if left on too long. However, all fish really needs is a coating of olive or coconut oil and some salt and pepper. The art is in the grilling -- just make sure you lather up both sides evenly."

          "headline":"Place it skin-side down and diagonally on the grill.",
          "description":"This not only creates those masterful grill marks you see in restaurants, it actually makes it easier to flip the fish because it's on an angle. The general rule is a fish will take 8 minutes to cook through per inch of thickness, which means about 3 to 5 minutes per side. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the grill, and let cook! Don't try to move the fish until you see that the skin side has a nice sear and looks crisp -- if you do, you risk it falling apart. If you're not sure when to check the fish to see this, try gently lifting with a fine-edged spatula after a few minutes. If it doesn't lift off the grate easily, let it cook a bit longer and check at 20-second intervals until it does."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Flip the fish.",
          "description":"Okay, so the fish is lifting off the grate and has the right color on the bottom. Time to flip. First, you need the right tool. A wide spatula with a thin, tapered edge does the job nicely by being able to slide easily under the fish and also large enough to support the whole fillet while you flip it. To make your life even easier, pair it with a flexible turner which can help hold the fish in place while the larger spatula slides underneath. While attempting the turn, if you feel too much resistance, just stop and walk away. If you've properly cleaned and oiled the grate, the fish will let you know when it's ready to turn by releasing itself from the grate."

          "headline":"Cover, cook, and check for doneness.",
          "description":"When cooked properly, the meat will be firm to the touch, flake easily with a fork, and appear opaque all the way through. Take a fork and gently pull back a flaky section in the center. If the fish is opaque with just a bit of translucent center, it's ready to come off. If using an instant read thermometer, the fish should be pulled when it registers between 130-135\u00b0F (54-57\u00b0C), letting it carry over to 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) while it rests."

          "description":"Look for shiny scales, clear eyes and bright red gills. The fisherman among us, or those who don\u2019t mind a little extra work, might enjoy cleaning, gutting and scaling the fish themselves. The rest of us should ask to have it done at the fish counter so when we get home, the fish is ready to go. A whole fish is much harder to overcook than a small fillet; the skin protects the delicate flesh from heat and keeps the moisture in. The bones add a little extra flavor, too. Throwing the fish over direct heat on a grill is a fast and easy cooking method that gives you moist, tender flesh, and crispy, salty skin every time."

Make at least 3-5 slashes in the meat perpendicular to the backbone on each side of the fish. You are doing this to open the interior of the fish to the heat, so it will cook evenly. Make more slashes closer to the head, where the fish is thicker, than toward the tail, which cooks first. Snip off any sharp fins with kitchen shears or scissors."

Fight the impulse to mess with the fish and move it around -- you'll rip the skin, lose some flesh, and throw off the cooking. Instead, stand there for 3-4 minutes. The fish is ready to be flipped when the skin no longer sticks to the grill. Generally, a fish that weighs 1/2 to 1 pound (.22 to .45 kg) will take about 5 to 7 minutes per side. Larger fish, 1 1/2 to 2 pounds (.7 to .9 kg), can take around twice that amount of time. Another general guideline for whole fish is 10 minutes of cooking per side, per inch of thickness."

It should come off the grates cleanly. If not, don\u2019t force it. Let the fish back down and come back at it with the spatula, using pressure to pry it off the grates. You don\u2019t want to pull the fish away from the grates and have half the skin and meat stick to the grill. Once the fish is flipped, let it cook for another 5-6 minutes. If the skin does stick to the grill, which is hard to avoid entirely, don\u2019t sweat it. The presentation might not be quite as pretty, but the fish will still taste just as good."
