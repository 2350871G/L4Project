For instance, if you live in the Northern hemisphere, February is the best time to prune your grape vines. While pruning can be a time-consuming task, you only need pruning shears or loppers to get the job done.Did you know? Different parts of grape plants have specific names and labels. Canes are thin wooden branches that grow from the cordon, which is the thicker trunk that runs along the trellis wires. All canes have multiple fruit buds, which eventually grow into grape plants. When canes are cut down to only have 1-2 buds, they\u2019re known as spurs."
