    "Simply fit a hanger over each of the spacing marks you drew, nail them to the rim joist, and slide the end of the joist down into the slot.",
    "Add bridging between the joists if they\u2019re longer than 9 feet (2.7 m).",
    "Bridging involves placing short sections of material perpendicularly between the joists to stabilize them.",
    "To install standard metal bridging, brace the pointed ends of the bars against the joists, then nail down the open ends.",
    "Install bridging on either end of the joists at a distance of \u2153 of their total span.",
    "If your floors are 15 feet (4.6 m) long, for example, you would position a brace 5 feet (1.5 m) from either end.",
    "Alternatively, you can fashion your own block supports by cutting 4 in (10 cm) x 4 in (10 cm) boards into 16 in (41 cm) sections to fit in between the joists.",
    "Line the blocks up in a row perpendicularly with the joists, then nail them into place through the face of the next joist.",
    "Bridging cuts down on the flexion of the lumber, reducing the stress put on it and extending its lifespan.",
    "Install the subfloor.",
    "Lay down \u20444 in (1.9 cm) tongue-and-groove plywood panels over the joists, then use wood glue or panel adhesive and galvanized flooring nails to secure each panel around its edges.",
    "Work in small sections until the entire floor is covered.",
    "When you\u2019re done, your floor will be framed and ready for the next phase of construction.",
    "Apply the glue a single section at a time.",
    "You don\u2019t want it to dry out before you have the chance to lay down the subfloor.",
    "Using both nails and glue (instead of just one or the other) will help ensure a perfectly flat, stable surface and prevent squeaking underfoot."
