          "description":"From finding the bones, to clearing them of soft tissue, to cleaning them, always wear rubber gloves. You\u2019ll be working with animal matter and tissue and will come into contact with some pretty nasty stuff. Depending on the stage of decomposition of the bones, you may also want to wear a respiratory mask."

          "description":"If you find a corpse that you want to use, let it sit above ground for at least 2-3 months. If you can, put up a wire-perimeter around it to keep other animals from scavenging it. Check the corpse once per month to see how the decomposition is progressing. Once most of the skin and meat is gone, you can simmer the bones to get the rest of the natural matter to fall away. Depending on the time of year, it could take upwards of 6 months for a corpse to decompose, which is why it\u2019s a good idea to check it once a month."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Leave the body in water for several months to let it naturally macerate.",
          "description":"This process helps the decomposition process move along a little more quickly than just letting the corpse sit above ground. Put the corpse into a plastic container or garbage bag and cover it with cold water. Set it somewhere out of the way and check it monthly to see how the decomposition is getting along. Soaking bones that have already mostly decomposed is also a great way to soften connective tissue and tendons to make them easier to cut through. Remember to always wear gloves when touching or checking the corpse! This process is going to smell really, really bad for several months. If you live in a city or an apartment building, this may not be the best option."

          "description":"This is a slightly less smelly option, but it can make the decomposition process take a bit longer. Let the corpse sit above-ground for a day before you bury it\u2014this way flies can access it and lay eggs which will then turn into maggots which will eat the flesh after the corpse has been buried. After you bury the corpse, leave it alone for 3 months before you check it. If you\u2019re burying an entire corpse, consider wrapping the animal in wire mesh to help keep all the bones together in one place."

          "headline":"Use biological washing powder to remove small amounts of soft tissue.",
          "description":"This is a great way to clean bones that you find out in nature that are already mostly clear of soft tissue. Buy biological washing powder from your grocery store (you can usually find it in the laundry aisle). Put your bones in a plastic container, cover them with warm water, and then add in a small scoop of the biological powder. Leave the bones alone for 3-4 days, and then rinse them off thoroughly. Biological washing powder has little enzymes in it that break down soft tissues, like fat, skin, and ligaments. You can use this method to clean off any residual tissue no matter what condition the corpse was in when you first found it."

Bring the water to a simmer (not a boil!) and leave the bones alone until the flesh falls away, which usually takes 12-24 hours.

Depending on how large the bones are or how often you do this, you may need a lot of peroxide, so buy it in bulk to save money. Most hydrogen peroxide that you find at drugstores comes in small bottles and is usually only 2% concentration. If you aren\u2019t able to get the 20% hydrogen peroxide, you could also buy hair developer which is usually 40%.
