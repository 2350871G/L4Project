Skip this step if you have only 1 slice to freeze. Most pizzas already come pre-sliced, but they are still connected along the crust. You need to separate the slices from each other completely. Wrap each slice individually with plastic wrap. Tear off a piece of plastic wrap and set it on the counter. Place a pizza slice on top of the plastic wrap, making sure it's centered.

Preparing and Freezing Uncooked Pizza Prepare and shape the pizza dough according to your recipe. Make the pizza dough first according to your recipe. Next, toss the dough and shape it into a crust. Transfer the dough to a round baking sheet. A baking sheet meant for pizza will work the best. If you are making a small pizza, then you can use the bottom from a spring-form cake pan instead. Simply find a spring-form cake pan that is the same size as your pizza. Open up the latch on the side of the pan, then pop the bottom of the pan out. Bake the crust at 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C) for 4 to 5 minutes. Preheat your oven to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C). Place the pizza onto a round baking sheet, if you have not already, then tuck it into the oven. Bake the pizza for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the dough looks puffy and dry. Do not add the toppings or bake the crust all the way. You will finish baking the crust when you are ready to eat it.

Take the pizza put of the freezer and remove the plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Leave the pizza on the baking sheet, and tuck it into the oven. Close the oven and let the pizza bake for about 10 minutes, or until the cheese has melted. There is no need to thaw the pizza first. Freezing Raw Pizza Dough Prepare the pizza dough and let it ferment, if needed. You can use this method to freeze balls or disks of raw pizza dough. If your recipe requires you to both ferment and proof the dough, only complete the fermentation step; skip the proofing step. Shape the dough as desired. Whether you roll the dough into a ball or flatten it into a crust is up to you. A ball may be easier to store, but a crust will reduce the amount of work you have to do later on. You can divide the dough into smaller portions to make mini pizzas. This will make it easier to store. Dust the dough with flour. Toss the ball around in a bowl filled with flour. If you made a crust, dust the top with flour, flip it over, then dust the back. This is important as it will prevent the dough from sticking in the later steps. Freeze the dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Place the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, then tuck the baking sheet into the freezer. Don't worry about covering the baking sheet. This is just the initial freezing; you will transfer the dough into a bag once it is completely frozen. How long the dough takes to freeze depends on whether you left it as a ball or shaped it into a crust; a full ball will take longer. Transfer the dough to a freezer-safe container. At this point, your dough is ready to store in the freezer. Place frozen balls of dough or small crusts into a large, plastic freezer bag. If you made a large pizza crust, it might be easier to wrap it with 2 layers of plastic wrap instead. Use the dough within 1 to 2 months. Clear some space in the freezer, and set the dough down. If you made a crust, make sure that it is sitting on a flat surface. Do not put anything on top of the pizza. Write the date on the plastic bag that you put the pizza into.
