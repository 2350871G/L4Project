For example, you might suggest that it was Colonel Mustard in the study with the lead pipe. Your fellow players would then search their cards for this suspect, room, and weapon. The player to your left would be the first to reveal one of these card to you if it is in his or her hand. Your fellow players would all take turns showing you one card from their hands if they have any of the cards you suggested.

You will have to return the cards to the envelope and continue revealing your cards to other players, but you may not make another accusation. Preparing to Play Set up the game board. Unfold your Clue game board and place it on your playing surface. The Clue game board features nine rooms that the six character pawns may move between. Make sure that you choose a game surface that all of your players can sit around and access the game board with ease. Up to six people can play Clue and they will all need to be able to access the board to move their character pawns. Place all six of the character pawns and weapons on the board. The character pawns are placed on their corresponding named starting squares, whilst the weapon pawns are placed in the rooms. You may place the weapon pawns in the rooms at random, making sure that there is only one weapon pawn in any room at the start of the game. Have each player take a detective\u2019s notes sheet and a pencil. Before you start the game, make sure that each player has a detective\u2019s notes sheet to keep track of suspects, rooms, and weapons. These sheets include a list of all of the suspects, rooms, and weapons, so players can check them off as they rule them out. For example, if a player has Mrs. Peacock, a candlestick, and the kitchen in her hand, then these cannot be in the envelope. That player would want to check those items off of his or her list to rule them out. Getting the Cards Ready Keep the three types of cards separated and shuffle each the card stacks. Clue comes with three different types of cards: suspects, rooms, and weapons. Keep these card types in separate stacks and shuffle each stack of cards. Then, place the stacks face down on the board. Place the \u201cCase File Confidential\u201d envelope in the center of the board. Draw one card from each of the three stacks and place these cards into the \u201cCase File Confidential\u201d envelope. Make sure that you keep these cards face down so that no one can see them. The player who guesses what these three cards are will win the game. Shuffle all three card stacks together and deal them out. After you have placed the cards into the \u201cCase File Confidential\u201d envelope, you can shuffle the remaining card stacks together. Then, deal all of the cards to the players so that you all have the same amount of cards. You may look at your cards, but do not show your cards to any of the other players.",
