The balloon will fill up with gas which will leak out the holes in it, but when the gas stops, the holes will close and air won\u2019t be able to get in and ruin your wine. This process is where the alcohol is being produced, and is called fermentation. If you use 2-Litres, then instead of using balloons you can tighten the cap to just before it is fully sealed, which will let gas escape when it builds up but won't let any in when it stops fermenting. Instead of a balloon, you can use a common fermenter airlock. They cost about $1.50."
