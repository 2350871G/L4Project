This article will teach you how to switch between different balls of yarn as you knit. Note that this method is not required to knit a scarf - you can keep the same color for the whole scarf and skip the steps about switching if you like. To achieve a multicolored look without switching yarns, try a variegated yarn that incorporates several different colors. Have 200 yards (182.9 m) of yarn at your disposal. Bigger needles create a looser stitch; smaller needles, a tighter one. Choose the size according to your desired look. For worsted weight yarn, size 8 to 10 needles are normally used."
