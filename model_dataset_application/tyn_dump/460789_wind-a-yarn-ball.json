  "text":" Finger Wrap Approach Gently untangle as much yarn as you can.  Loosen any knotted areas but be careful not to pull it into two pieces.  Find one end of the yarn.  Lightly wrap the end of the yarn around your fingers.  Remove the wrapped loops and hold them in one hand.  Wrap the remaining yarn around the loops until no more will comfortably fit.  Pinch the \"football\" shape you have created between your thumb and forefinger of one hand.  Wrap the yarn lengthwise around the \"football\", flattening it into a rounder shape by pulling snugly as you go.  Change directions of your wrap every 15 to 20 rounds. There is no \"right\" direction. Just wrap until it's rounded. Continue until all of the yarn mass is wrapped into an easy to manage yarn ball!  Using the Center Pull Approach Use your fingers again. When you wrap the yarn in the beginning, wrap it around your pinky finger and your thumb in a figure eight, making sure the loose end doesn't get caught up in it. Pinch the figure eight in the center and pull it off of your fingers.  Wrap the remaining yarn around the center of the figure eight. Again, be sure that loose end is free. Continue wrapping around the figure eight until you have a ball. See the video below for visuals. Finished.  Cardboard Square Approach Take a square of cardboard and cut a notch in it.  Tie one end of the yarn around the cardboard square.  Wrap the yarn around the square. This will start to form a small ball with more wraps. Roll the yarn reasonably tightly. Switch the side you are wrapping every few minutes. Go for a cross pattern. As the ball grows, this enhances the stability and prevents it from tangling. Keep wrapping until all of the yarn is used up. Eventually, you will have a neat ball. Finish up. To end it, take the last strand and tuck it under another one Using a hand-operated yarn baller Put the skein or hank on a swift. If you don't have one, then put it on a chair. First untwist the hank, then put it on the swift, and adjust the swift to make it the same size as the hank. Use an end of the skein and put it through the piece of metal that looks like a coil.  Pull part of the yarn through the coil and put it into the notch in the yarn baller.  Turn the crank clockwise while holding the yarn taught.  Pull the yarn off the winder. Now you're done!",
