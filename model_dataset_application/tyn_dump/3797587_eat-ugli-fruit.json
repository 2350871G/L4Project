The ugli fruit is actually another name for the Jamaican tangelo. It was discovered in Jamaica and became one of the country's exports starting in 1914. While the fruit is imported to the United States, its supply is fairly limited, so it can be somewhat expensive. On average, it costs two to three times more than a grapefruit costs. Check with stores in your area known for having a wider variety of international goods, including imported produce. Many standard grocery stores may not carry ugli fruit, and local farmers' markets will almost never offer them."

          "description":"You cannot tell how ripe an ugli fruit is based on its color. Instead, you should look for a fruit that feels heavy for its size and has a slight give when pressed at the blossom end with the tip of your thumb. This fruit lives up to its name, and most agree that it looks ugly from the outside. The skin is yellow-green with occasional hints of orange, and thickest at the neck end. It looks a little like a mandarin orange, but it has larger pores and a knobby or lumpy appearance. Do not worry about surface scarring, uneven coloring, or loose skin. None of this says anything about the quality of the fruit. Most ugli fruits are fairly large, but smaller ugli fruits tend to have more flavor and more sweetness. The diameter ranges from 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm). If there are any soft spots or brown spots on the fruit, gently press them with your thumb. If your thumb goes through, the fruit is spoiled. The fruit should have a little give, especially at the blossom end, but it should not be mushy."

          "headline":"Store the fruit at room temperature.",
          "description":"You should eat ugli fruit within five days if kept at room temperature. If you refrigerate it, however, you can store it for up to two weeks. The fruit does not need to be stored in a container of any type. Check the fruit daily to make sure that it is not going bad. Look for developing soft spots, and press into these soft spots with your thumb to see if the skin breaks. If the skin does break, the fruit may already be overripe and partially rotten."

When you cut the ugli fruit open, the inside should look similar to that of an orange, but the fruit should appear slightly fleshier than an orange would. Unlike grapefruit, the ugli fruit is sweet enough on its own and does not need any added sugar. If you do add sugar to the fruit, you may even find it too sweet. An ugli fruit can be enjoyed in this manner as a simple, light breakfast. If you want to use the fruit for a light yet exotic lunch or dessert, you can cut it in half and drizzle it with a bit of sherry or kirsch before enjoying it."

The skin is thick yet loose and puffy, so you should be able to remove it with your fingers. There are seldom any seeds, so you should not have to worry about removing seeds before enjoying the fruit. The segments inside the fruit are also easy to separate, and you should be able to separate those with your fingers, as well. Enjoy the fruit in this manner as a snack or side dish to your breakfast, lunch, or dinner."
