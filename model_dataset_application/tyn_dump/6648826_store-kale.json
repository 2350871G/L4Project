If you don't have a crisper drawer, keep the kale in the door compartment or on a standard refrigerator shelf with the stems facing toward the back of the refrigerator. The back of the refrigerator is the coldest area, and the stems are the hardiest portion of the kale, so they're less likely to become damaged from the cold. Note that the kale may become more bitter after several days, even with proper storage, so it's still best to use it as soon as possible."
