It will be easier to apply the sprinkles to an elevated cake, so if you have a cake stand, rest your cake on that, and then set the stand in the baking tray. Make sure that the cake is completely cooled before applying the icing; otherwise, the sugar coating will melt."

          "headline":"Apply a thin layer of your chosen icing around the cake to seal the crumbs.",
          "description":"This is called a crumb-coat and it helps to give your icing a smoother appearance. Having a smooth icing surface will make distributing the sprinkles on the cake easier for all application methods. Cover the cake with buttercream icing, ganache, or your favorite flavor of frosting. Just make sure that the layer is thin and evenly displaced."

          "headline":"Allow the crumb-coat to chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to harden.",
          "description":"Some icings, like a thin ganache, may take less time to set, but other icings, like a thick buttercream, may take longer. After 20 minutes, gently tap the outside of the cake with a clean hand to see if the frosting has hardened. If the frosting is still tacky, let the cake chill for another 5 minutes before taking it out of the refrigerator."

          "description":"It is easiest to apply most coatings with an offset spatula. Continue to coat the cake evenly until you reach a desired thickness of icing. Freshly applied icing will create a sticky surface for the sprinkles to adhere to. If you are planning to roll your cake in the sprinkles, do not frost the top of the cake as you will have to hold the bottom and top of the cake to roll it. If you want to use fondant, cover the cake with fondant as you normally would."

          "headline":"Choose sprinkles that will complement the icing and the cake flavor.",
          "description":"Draw inspiration from some of the ingredients in your cake. If your cake has candied cherries in it, accent the outside with a white icing and vibrant red sprinkles. Also, note the color of your icing. Sprinkles that are a dark color may not be as noticeable against a dark chocolate icing as they would against a vanilla icing. Pick sprinkles colors that complement seasonal and holiday cakes. Choose a mixture of orange, purple, and black sprinkles to decorate a pumpkin spice cake during the fall or around Halloween. Think about using red, pink, and white sprinkles for anniversaries or Valentine\u2019s Day. Use nonpareils for a speckled rainbow look, or ovular jimmies for bigger splotches of color. Mix both sprinkle styles together to vary the visual texture. Use large confetti sprinkles or sugar coated chocolate sprinkles for a minimalist look or mix them with smaller sprinkles to make them stand out."

    "You do not have to use candy melts.",
    "Instead, melt baking chocolate or another chocolate form.",
    "Just know that melting white chocolate bars or chips will have a slightly more yellowed appearance than the candy melts.",
    "Take the melted white chocolate and stir in a few drops of food coloring to create a colorful base for the sprinkles.",
    "Pick a color that will contrast nicely with the selection of sprinkles you chose.",
    "Add \u215b cup (28 g) of shortening to thin out the melted chocolate.",
    "Continue to stir in the mixture until the chocolate fully melts and the shortening disperses.",
    "If the mixture still seems too thick to spread over the fondant on your cake, add more shortening until you reach a consistency you are satisfied with.",
    "Instead of shortening, add an equal amount of cocoa butter to thin the mixture.",
    "Use an offset spatula to quickly spread the mixture onto the fondant.",
    "Your goal is to create an even, thin layer around the sides of the cake.",
    "The candy melts will harden within about 8 minutes of application, so you need to ice the fondant as quickly as possible to ensure that the sprinkles will stick.",
    "If you are adding sprinkles to the top of the cake, spread the mixture around the top as well.",
    "Use your hand to press the sprinkles around the base of the cake.",
    "To do this effectively, use one hand to press on the sprinkles and the other to rotate the cake.",
    "It will help to apply the sprinkles in layers, working from the bottom of the cake upwards.",
    "This will give you more application control.",
    "If you have a turntable, set your cake on top of it and spin it to apply the sprinkles to speed up the process.",
    "Repeat this process for the middle and upper portions of the cake.",
    "If you want to apply sprinkles to the top of the cake, press in sprinkles there as well.",
    "Press the sprinkles gently into the fondant with an offset spatula.",
    "This will smooth out any lumpy or clotted sprinkle placement around the cake, and remove excess sprinkles that did not adhere.",
    "Fill in any glaring holes or empty patches in the design by pressing more sprinkles onto the cake.",
    "Pay particular attention to the top edge as you may have to specifically press in sprinkles to that area.",
    "Allow the cake decorations to finish setting before you move or serve it.",
    "The candy melts mixture should not take more than 5 minutes to finish hardening.",
    "Once the cake has set, transport it to the table to show off to your family members and friends."
