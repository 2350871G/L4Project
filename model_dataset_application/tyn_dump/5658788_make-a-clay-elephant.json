Make one stocky sausage shaped roll from the clay. Cut four exactly same sized pieces to form the four legs for the elephant. Roll and flatten out two small pieces for the ears. Use a clay cutting tool to shape the ears in the traditional elephant ear's shape, cutting away excess clay. Make a smaller version of the ears. This time make them out of pink clay. Stick the onto the ears."

Tusks are another possibility, from white clay. They're not essential, as your figurine is representative, but if you'd like to add them, then feel free to do so."

Each time that you add a piece of clay, use the clay tool to help smooth the pieces into each other, so that the end result looks seamless. Test that the elephant is standing firmly. When you're happy that it's balanced, add the next items. Attach the ears, once again smoothing the clay pieces together neatly. Shape the ears so that they are standing outward and look realistic. Add the eyes. Simply stick these on; don't press too hard or their definition will be squashed."

Gently attach this to the elephant's face, under the eyes. Smooth the clay into place. When you're happy that it's properly attached, use the clay tool to add small cuts down the length of the trunk, to make it appear wrinkled, as elephant trunks appear in real life."

If using for jewelry, be sure to attach a finding piece or loop before the charm is dried or baked, so that it stays in place firmly."
