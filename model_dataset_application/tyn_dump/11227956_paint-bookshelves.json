If possible, move your bookcase into the garage so that you don't get spray paint on anything in the room. If your bookcase is built-in, or too heavy to move, then protect your room by taping plastic tarps over any floor, walls, or furniture close to the painting. Open windows and doors to increase ventilation in your painting space. Spray-painting creates fumes that aren't good to breathe in. Consider placing a fan facing out the window to blow out air and keep it circulating in the room. Wipe down your bookcase with a tack cloth. A tack cloth is a lint-free cloth that is slightly tacky (sticky), which means it can pick up dust much better than your average cleaning rag.

Once your bookcase is dry, you can take away your drop cloth, and move your bookcase to wherever you want it. Using a Paintbrush and Acrylic Paint Ventilate your room and lay down a drop cloth. Liquid paint doesn't emit as many fumes as spray-paint, but it's still important to ventilate your room by opening up windows and doors. Also lay down a drop cloth to protect your floor from paint drips. Sand your bookcase with 150-grit sandpaper. You can sand by hand if you like, but that takes a while. It's quicker to sand with a palm sander, a little machine you can attach sandpaper to. If your bookcase has a woodgrain, sand in the direction of the grain. Only sand enough to take away any shine that's on the surface. Don't gouge into the wood itself. You don't have to sand away all the old paint!

Stir your acrylic paint with a stir stick and test on some scrap wood. Acrylic is a great paint to use for a bookshelf. Latex paints, which are commonly used for walls, can sometimes remain tacky, which isn't good for putting books on. Stir your paint to make sure it's all a consistent color and test it on some scrap wood. Practicing on scrap wood will help you figure out how much paint to load on the brush, and how long to make your brushstrokes, before you start on the actual bookcase. Paint the bookshelf in a light, even coat in the direction of the grain. Dip the paintbrush in the bucket of paint and rub off any excess paint on the scrap wood so that your brush isn't dripping. Then paint lightly in the direction of the wood grain. Use long, even strokes. Start at the bottom of the bookcase and work upwards. Let the bookshelf dry completely after the first coat of paint.
