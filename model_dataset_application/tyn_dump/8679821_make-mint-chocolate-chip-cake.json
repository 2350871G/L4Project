You'll need:\n2 cups (400 g) white sugar\n1 3/4 cup (218 g) all-purpose flour\n1 cup (100 g) unsweetened, Dutch process cocoa powder\n1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\n1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda\n1 teaspoon salt"

Once they're done baking, a tester should come out clean and the tops of the cakes should spring back a little if you press them in the center. Wear hot pads and take the cakes out of the oven.

Dollop a scoop of the frosting on the layer and use an offset spatula to spread it evenly across the top. Set the other layer of cake on top and scoop more frosting on it. Spread the frosting across the top and sides of the cake. Store the leftover cake in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
