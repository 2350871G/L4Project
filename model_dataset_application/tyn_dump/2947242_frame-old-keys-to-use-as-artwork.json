Put keys that went to old vehicles in one pile, keys to former residences in another, etc. If you come across \u201cmystery\u201d keys, you may as well toss them now. Determine what kind of artwork you\u2019d like to create. For example, if you want to design a special anniversary gift for your parents, find old keys they used through the years, displaying the keys with the most significance. Consider how you\u2019d like to display the keys and tell your story. A shallow shadow box will hold keys nicely on display and provide you with room to write or type the key origin.
