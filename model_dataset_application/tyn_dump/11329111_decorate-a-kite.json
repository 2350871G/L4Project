Before adding any decorations, measure the edges of your kite and cut long, even strips of decorative border to match. After applying a long, thin line of super or tacky glue on the edge of the kite, stick the row of rhinestones onto the edge. For extra security, apply some pressure to keep the gems in place. If you don\u2019t have any rhinestone strips on hand, consider gluing on rhinestones individually. You can find both individual rhinestones and rhinestone strips at your craft store. Feel free to use a lace border in place of rhinestones."

Try to create a pattern with the charms and alternate them by color and shape. Continue all the way around until the inside edge of the kite border is filled with charms. If you can\u2019t find any adhesive plastic charms, get a pack of regular, non-sticky charms instead. Use hot, craft, or school glue to add charms to your kite."
