The first category is modern cards, or cards that were produced from the 1970s to the present. Then your next category is post-war cards, or cards produced between 1948 and 1969. Your last category of cards, if you have any of these, is call pre-war cards, or cards produced before WW2. If you find that many of your cards are modern cards, you might not get much money for them. Modern cards were produced at the highest volume, so their value is very small."

This is not the player's number; it's the card's name. You can either use an online edition or find a hard copy to determine a rough estimate. For example, rookie Barry Bonds Topps card ID number is 12. The market has it listed for $12 USD."
