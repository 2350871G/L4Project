For a thicker ganache, like for truffles, use a 2:1 ratio of chocolate to cream. For a frosting ganache, use a 1:1 ratio. For a thin, pourable ganache, use a 1:1.5 ratio. Compound chocolate is made of cocoa, sweeteners, and vegetable fat, and it melts down a little differently than baking chocolate does. Because of this, you do need a higher ratio of chocolate to cream than you would with couverture chocolate. When you measure out the chocolate and cream, use a scale rather than measuring cups to be as precise as possible."
