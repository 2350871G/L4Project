This will allow enough time for the heat to transfer to the grates. The high heat will turn any food remnants into ash, making it easier to clean off. If you\u2019re using a charcoal grill, light the charcoal and allow it to burn until the coal turns white."

Use long, sweeping motions to move the brush back and forth along each grill grate. Dip the grill brush in a bucket of water before scraping to create steam to dissolve the grease. Wear heat-resistant gloves to protect your hands and arms from the high heat."

Then, mix the charcoal with tongs and spray them with water. Once the grill is cool, grab a clean cloth, immerse it in water, and wring it out until it\u2019s damp. Use the cloth to wipe down the grill grates and remove any leftover residue. It may take 2-5 hours for a gas grill to completely cool down, while charcoal grills may take up to 24 hours to completely cool down."

If oil comes in contact with a flame, it will create a fireball. You can also use a cloth to oil the grill instead of a paper towel.

  "text":" Cleaning Your Grill Preheat the grill on high heat for 15 minutes. Before cleaning your grill, heat it up to the maximum temperature. Put the lid on the grill and let it heat up for 10-15 minutes. This will allow enough time for the heat to transfer to the grates. The high heat will turn any food remnants into ash, making it easier to clean off. If you\u2019re using a charcoal grill, light the charcoal and allow it to burn until the coal turns white. Turn off the heat and use a grill brush to scrape residue from of the grill grates. A grill brush made with wire bristles is best for scraping off burnt food from your grill. Make sure it has a long handle so your hand doesn\u2019t get too close to the heat. Use long, sweeping motions to move the brush back and forth along each grill grate. Dip the grill brush in a bucket of water before scraping to create steam to dissolve the grease. Wear heat-resistant gloves to protect your hands and arms from the high heat.

Applying the Oil Pour 2 cups (470 mL) of oil with a high smoke point into a small bowl. When oiling your grill, choose an oil that can tolerate high heat. Some of these oils include vegetable oil, canola oil, and grapeseed oil. Pour a small amount in a bowl to prepare for the next step. Rub each grate with paper towels dipped in oil. Saturate the paper towels but don't get so much oil that it's dripping off the towels. Hold the paper towels with tongs and wipe each grill grate.
