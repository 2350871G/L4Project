To make the spray, get water, hot pepper flakes or chopped hot peppers, and biodegradable dish soap. You can find hot pepper flakes at most grocery stores in the spice aisle, or you can order packets of the flakes online."

          "description":"Cooking the flakes in the water will help to release the capsaicin into the water and make the mixture more potent. If you don\u2019t have hot pepper flakes available, you can use 10 chopped cayenne or jalapeno peppers. Tip:  If you\u2019re dealing with larger pests, like bears or moose, add an additional 2-3 tbsp (10.6-15.9 g) of hot pepper flakes to the mixture. This will make the spray more potent to scare them off!"

          "description":"Move the pot onto a burner and cover it with a lid. Wait for the water to reach a boil, and lower the temperature to a medium heat. Then, stir the mixture regularly as it cooks to infuse the pepper into the water. Your eyes may start to water if there\u2019s a lot of steam rising from the pot. Try to keep your face away from the steam, and leave the pot partially covered while you stir."

Leave the pot covered and place it in a safe area to diffuse the pepper flavor into the water. Some gardeners let their mixture sit for up to 48 hours for a very potent infusion. However, this may not be necessary if you\u2019re only planning to use the spray in your garden."

Since you\u2019re going to be spraying the liquid, you don\u2019t want the hot peppers suspended in the water. They can clog the spray bottle, making your spray less effective."

Make sure you only add the soap to the liquid after the pepper flakes have been strained out of the water. If they\u2019re still in the water, the soap will stick to the flakes and get strained out. Try using a castile soap, which is biodegradable and safe for outdoor use. It won\u2019t harm your plants or soil, but is powerful enough to add some sticking power to the spray."

When you\u2019re ready to use the spray, make sure the cap and nozzle are secured, and shake the bottle vigorously. If you get some liquid on your hands as you\u2019re pouring it into the bottle, avoid touching your face, and immediately wash your hands to prevent irritation."

Make sure you spray every part of the plant that you want to protect, since the animals can sometimes eat around the unsprayed parts. If you're not sure how sensitive plants will react to the spray, test a small area of a leaf first. Wait four days and if the plant doesn't react, you should be able to safely use the spray. Avoid plants, like ivy, ferns, succulents, palms, some types of tomatoes, and azaleas, which are known to be sensitive to insecticides and pesticides. Never apply the spray in the middle of the day because the heat from the sun can cause the spray to \u201cbake\u201d the leaves and kill the plant.Caution: If you have pets in your yard, like cats and dogs, you may want to partition off any areas that you've sprayed. Your pets can experience discomfort and burning sensations if they come in contact with or eat vegetation that has been sprayed with hot peppers."

When the squirrels eat the seeds, they\u2019ll experience a burning sensation in their mouths and won\u2019t revisit the bird feeder. Don\u2019t worry about the birds eating the spray. They don\u2019t have the same reaction to the spray and will still be able to enjoy the seeds. Other Ways to Repel Squirrels\nSprinkle hot pepper flakes in your garden to deter them. If squirrels are digging up your mulch and eating your plants, lay the flakes in the squirrels' favorite spots. Set up wind chimes and pinwheels to create noise and movement. Position pinwheels and wind chimes throughout your garden to scare squirrels away. Try mixing cayenne powder with petroleum jelly. If you have squirrels who like to climb poles or hang from ledges, mix 1 teaspoon (5.3 g) of cayenne powder into 3 tablespoons (40 g) of petroleum jelly. Then, smear the jelly in the places where they're climbing and running to deter them."

Pour the liquid into a small spray bottle to carry with you while hiking or camping for safety in case of an unexpected bear encounter. If you have bears visiting your yard, spray the areas that they frequent. You can use a spray with less potency on camping materials, like your tent and the outside of your cooler for an extra layer of safety while you\u2019re camping.

If you notice the animal pests have been avoiding the areas that you\u2019ve sprayed, but have chosen new targets in your garden, try spraying as many plants as you can.
