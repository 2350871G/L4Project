Join a short angular line from the base at the left to the edge on the roof.  Create short straight lines for the guides to the seats and the rear-view mirror.  Come down to the wheels and draw further circles within the outline.  From the centre of the wheels create spoke-lines all around.  Create three lines joining each other at the rear of the car.  Draw step by step every line in detail.  Erase all guidelines.  Color the car.  Method 2: Starting with Lines Make a couple of angular lines parallel to each other.  Join them with opposite lines to form a slanted box for the bonnet.  Join the box with another one for the guide to the wind screen.  Join a couple of lines for the roof and the slanted back of the car.  Stretch a line across the body of the car from the base of the wind screen.  Taking the above created line as the base, draw the glass window.  Attach a rectangle from the edge of the bonnet.  Complete the guide to the body of the car.  Draw ovals for the wheels.  Make a couple of further ovals within the wheel outlines.  Draw the spoke-guides.  Add lines at the bottom of the wheels for the tyre-thickness.  Add headlight areas and a rear-view mirror with irregular boxes.  Draw all necessary details.  Erase outlines.  Color the Lamborghini.  Method 3: Sketching Draw an oval for the car's midsection.

Method 4: Starting with a Trapezoid Draw a 3D trapezoid shape.  Reciprocate the trapezoid facing the opposite direction.  Draw two ovals for the wheels.
