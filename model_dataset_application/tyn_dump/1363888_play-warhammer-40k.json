As a new player, don't worry about how powerful each army is. Pick an army that grabs your attention with cool models, or a story you enjoy. You'll spend a lot of time with this army, and choosing something that appeals to you is more important than which army is \"powerful.\" Necrons, Grey Knights, Space Marines, Chaos Marines, and Eldar are all good options for new players.

Your units get various bonuses for fulfilling these requirements, as described in your Rulebook and Codex.

    "For each Mastery Level, choose a discipline and roll on that discipline's chart to see what power the unit has this battle.",
    "If you don't like, it, switch to the discipline's Primary power instead.",
    "Set up the battlefield.",
    "You can play on any flat surface.",
    "A 6 x 4 foot board is the most common size, but if you have small armies (500 points) you can use an area as small as 4 x 4.",
    "Terrain is optional, but highly recommended, and can be placed anywhere that all players agree on.",
    "This can be purchased warhammer terrain or homemade terrain.",
    "Warhammer rules always use inches.",
    "12 inches = 1 foot.",
    "You don't even have to play on a rectangular board, but most people prefer to.",
    "Deploy your army.",
    "Check the mission for deployment rules.",
    "If there aren't any, use any of the deployment zones in the Rulebook.",
    "(For example, the two players pick opposite sides of the board and must place their units within 12 inches of that side.)",
    "Roll dice to see who deploys first.",
    "That player puts down all his units, then the second player puts down all her units.",
    "If you can't fit all your units in your deployment zone, read the \"Reserves\" section of the Rulebook.",
    "See who goes first.",
    "Whoever deployed first gets to choose whether he goes first or second.",
    "(First is usually better.)",
    "If he chose to go first, the second play can roll a die.",
    "If it comes up 6, she \"Seizes the Initiative\" and goes first instead.",
    "Check the victory condition.",
    "Most missions will tell you how long the game will last, and how to decide who wins at the end of it.",
    "If your mission doesn't, try these suggested rules:\nThe game ends in five turns.",
    "Earn 1 victory point for each completely destroyed enemy unit.",
    "Slay the Warlord: Earn 1 point for removing the enemy warlord\nFirst Blood: Earn 1 point if you were the first to destroy a unit.",
    "Linebreaker: Earn 1 point if you have a unit within 12 inches of the enemy table edge at end of game.",
    "Understand controlling objectives.",
    "If the mission has objective markers, players take turns placing them.",
    "The markers must be at least 6 inches from the table edge, and 12 inches from each other.",
    "To control an objective (and earn victory points), you must control all units within 3 inches of the objective.",
    "If you have a Battle Forged Army, some detachments will have the Objective Secured ability.",
    "Units in these detachments can control an objective even if an enemy unit is nearby, unless the enemy has the same ability.",
    "Taking a Turn Move all your units.",
    "First, move every one of your models.",
    "Most infantry models can move 6 inches, but check the codex entry for vehicles and monsters.",
    "Measure the distance with your tape measure from the center of the model, and place the center of the model at the far edge of the tape measure.",
    "Models in the same unit stick together.",
    "A model can't move farther than 2 inches horizontally from the nearest model in the same unit.",
    "If you start your turn with them farther apart than this, they must move back together (or as close as they can).",
    "Most terrain slows down most unit types.",
    "Check the Rulebook for more info.",
    "Use psychic powers.",
    "If you have any Psykers in your army, roll a die.",
    "Add the result to the total Mastery Level of all Psyker units you have.",
    "This is the number of your Warp Charge dice for this turn.",
    "Spend these on psychic powers as described in the Rulebook.",
    "Shoot the enemy.",
    "Now each of your units with ranged weapons can make an attack against any enemy the unit can \"see\" within its weapon's range.",
    "All models in that unit fire at the same time.",
    "Roll a die and use the unit's Ballistic Skill (BS) to see whether it was a hit.",
    "The Follow the Wound Chart and instructions in the Rulebook to check for injured or killed enemies.",
    "Only one model in the unit needs to \"see\" the enemy.",
    "If you're not sure, put your eye down to the board and look.",
    "Banners, wings, weapons, and other \"poky bits\" don't count; you need to be able to see the core of the model.",
    "There are many shooting rules not covered here.",
    "It's worth reading this Rulebook section in detail.",
    "Charge the enemy.",
    "You can now charge the enemy and attack with each of your units.",
    "This has drawbacks, since units in close combat cannot move or shoot in future turns.",
    "Pick an enemy within maximum charging distance (usually 12 inches).",
    "That enemy gets to make an Overwatch attack, described in the Rulebook.",
    "Roll two dice.",
    "Move the unit up to the total result, in inches.",
    "If the base of one of your models is touching the base of an enemy, the whole units are in close combat.",
    "Fight the enemy.",
    "The final portion of your turn only applies to units in close combat.",
    "Make attacks using the Fight rules.",
    "Reading this Rulebook section carefully is recommended.",
    "Here are the most important points to remember:\nModels attack in order of highest Initiative to lowest.",
    "This includes enemy models.",
    "Each model's Attack (A) value tells you how many attacks it can make.",
    "Use the To Hit and To Wound charts to find the results of attacks.",
    "Send the losers running.",
    "After all models have attacked, the side with more Wounds makes a Morale Check by rolling two dice.",
    "If the result is higher than the units' Leadership, the unit must Fall Back.",
    "Roll two dice again and move that many inches, straight back to the unit's starting table edge.",
    "These units get one chance each turn to Regroup, as described in the rules.",
    "If they fail, they keep moving back the same way.",
    "When they reach the table edge, they become casualties and leave the game.",
    "Pass the turn.",
    "You've completed one turn.",
    "The enemy player now repeats these steps.",
    "Continue playing until you reach the end point you agreed on.",
    "This is usually a number of turns (try 5 for your first game), a time limit, or when a certain mission objective is complete."
