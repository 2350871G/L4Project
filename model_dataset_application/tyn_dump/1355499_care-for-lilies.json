To find a good drainage location, find the spot in your garden that dries out the quickest after a pour of rain. If there is no obvious location, plant your lilies on a slope, and let gravity take care of your drainage. Find a spot that gets sunshine at least half the day. Too long in the shade, and the lilies will reach for the sun, and take on a noticeable lean. A full day's sun is ideal. Lily leaves can be infested with fungal botrytis if the planting location is less than ideal. While botrytis is great for certain types of wine grapes, it reduces the leaf area used for manufacturing the sugars that will result in healthy new bulbs."

Your holes should be 2 to 3 times as deep as the bulb itself. Plant the bulb with the pointed side up. You can also plant them in a raised bed: plant them at ground level, then put 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15cm) of soil on top of them. This will also promotes good drainage. Space them properly. If you're planting multiple lilies, give each lily about a 6-inch radius so that they have their own place in the sun. Loosen the dirt at the bottom of the hole, sprinkle a little bone meal into the bottom, then place the lily bulbs inside and cover with dirt. Water immediately.

If you're expecting cold weather, lay a top coating of mulch over the plantings to protect the shoots. Trumpet lilies are the most vulnerable to frost damage. Make sure you keep your mulch slug-free!
