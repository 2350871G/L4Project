Some patterns will tell you to fold your fabric a certain way, or how to lay them on your fabric to get the most out of it. Read the instructions on the package of your pattern carefully and follow them if there are any. Most advanced patterns will have specific instructions. Cut the pattern pieces out of the paper 1 inch (2.5 cm) outside the lines. Do not cut your pattern directly on the lines in case you need more room while sewing your garment. Use new scissors that aren\u2019t dull to cut your pattern. If your pattern is already in separate pieces, you don\u2019t need to do this. You will most likely need to cut patterns that only have a few pieces. Positioning the Pattern Pieces on the Fabric Lay out your fabric on a flat surface, like a table or countertop. Wipe down your surface to make sure it is clean. Smooth your fabric out with the palms of your hands to make sure there aren\u2019t any lumps that will disrupt your pattern. If your fabric is folded over itself, line up the edges so that they are straight.Tip: If your fabric is especially large, lay it out on the floor.

You can also pull at a loose thread at the end of your fabric and observe which way it pulls. This will show you the direction of the grain. Locate the grainline on your pattern. Most patterns will point in the direction of their grain with an arrow or a line. Find this on the larger pieces of your pattern to identify which way you should be laying your pattern. Often, it is labeled \u201cgrainline.\u201d Set your pattern on the fabric with the arrow in the direction of the grain. Lay your pattern on the fabric with the arrow, or grainline, in the same direction as the fabric\u2019s grain. If your pattern calls for your pieces against the grain, lay them with the arrow in the opposite direction. It will be much harder to put on the clothes that you make if they are sewn against the grain, unless your pattern calls for it. Inserting Pins and Cutting the Fabric Use straight pins that are an appropriate size for your fabric. Sewing pins come in a variety of sizes. If your fabric is thick, like velvet, use large, long pins. If your fabric is thin and delicate, like silk, stick to small, short pins to avoid damaging the fabric. You can buy sewing pins at most craft supply stores. Insert a pin every 6 inches (15 cm) and at each corner. You do not need a ton of pins to keep your pattern in place. Use sewing pins to pin down the edges of the pattern onto the fabric. Use a pin at every corner to keep the corners down and about every 6 inches (15 cm) on the sides of the pattern. Stick the pin through the pattern and fabric, then bring it back up again through the fabric and the pattern.Tip: Use as few pins as possible to avoid poking too many holes in your fabric. Keep pins on the inside of the pattern lines. Keep the area around the pattern lines free. Put each pin about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the pattern edge. Place the pins parallel to the pattern lines to avoid cutting through them. Use sharp scissors to cut your fabric along the pattern edge. Do not cut into any part of the pattern. Cut your fabric along the edge of the pattern. Keep the pins in until you have finished cutting out the entire pattern. Allow your scissors to glide through your fabric to create straight, even lines. Cut into seam allowances on your pattern if it has any. Seam allowances are extra space given on the edges of a pattern for when you start to sew. They often look like small triangles and may be in clusters of 3. Use your scissors to cut out each triangle before you remove your pattern. Remove the pins and the pattern before you start sewing.
