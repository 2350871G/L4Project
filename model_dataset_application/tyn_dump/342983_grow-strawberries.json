Pot-grown plants are young strawberry plants that are already established and grown a little. You can sometimes get berries the same year as you plant it, although you may need to wait a year for a full harvest. Runners are generally a cheaper option. These are seedlings with long roots that are taken from other strawberry plants. These may take a little longer to grow in your garden and to produce a harvest."
