Line the bottom of your pans with parchment paper, butter the paper, and then sprinkle flour all over it. Gently shake the flour around and shake the excess out of the pan. Don't be tempted to skip the parchment paper. It will ensure that the cake doesn't stick to the pans and will make it easy to remove."
