Leave the tomatoes in the water for approximately 45 seconds to a minute, or until their skins begin to split. Any kind of red tomatoes will work for the sauce, but roma tomatoes are a good option. You can also do a combination of several types of tomatoes. Use a pair of tongs to drop the tomatoes into the boiling water so you don\u2019t burn yourself."
