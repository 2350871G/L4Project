          "description":"Use a sharp knife to cut the delicata squash in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds and fiber and divide each half once more. Use a serrated knife for best results. A knife with a smooth blade is more likely to slip on the skin of the squash, making it harder to cut open the squash and easier to accidentally cut yourself. Use a metal spoon or melon-baller to scoop out the seeds and \"fuzzy\" fibers inside the squash. Save the seeds for roasting, if desired. When cutting the halves into quarters, cut each half diagonally, working from the top corner to the opposite bottom corner. The resulting pieces should vaguely resemble boats."

Sprinkle up to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of brown sugar over the slices, patting it down into place so that it sticks to the squash."
