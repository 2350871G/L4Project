Add a pinch of salt to the pot right before you add the noodles and let them cook according to the time on the box, usually 10-12 minutes. Stir occasionally, every 1-2 minutes. When they are done, drain the water and set aside the noodles to cool. You will likely need you biggest pot, filled 2/3 with water, to fit the noodles. As you wait for the water to boil and noodles to cook you can move on to making the filling, however. Some companies sell \"Oven Ready\" noodles that don't need to be boiled, so be sure to read the box to check."

Looking to get more vegetables in your lasagna? Add 1/2 cup chopped carrots, celery and/or green peppers here as well for a heartier sauce. If you do, allow the vegetables to cook and extra 1-2 minutes."

If you have time, cook the meat in a separate pan, though this is not necessary. If you are using sausage, cut the casings off so you only have the ground meat inside.

Raise the heat to medium until the sauce comes to a low simmer, when occasional bubbles break the surface of the sauce. You can substitute 36 ounces of pre-made pasta sauce instead of the three different tomato products for a simpler sauce.
