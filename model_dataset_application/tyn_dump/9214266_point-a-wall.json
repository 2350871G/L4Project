Lime mortar should be available for purchase at a local hardware store or gardening center. Landscaping-supply businesses will also likely sell lime mortar. It\u2019s difficult to estimate how much lime mortar you\u2019ll need to point your wall. It depends on how badly your wall is in need of repair, and whether you\u2019ll be pointing 1, 10, or 100 cracks. That said, if you\u2019re pointing a relatively small wall that\u2019s 3.3 feet (1 m) high by 6.6 feet (2 m) (2 m) wide, you\u2019ll need about 40 lb (18 kg) of lime mortar. A 60-pound (27-kg) bag of lime mortar will usually cost around $5\u2013$10 at your local hardware or home-supply store. You\u2019ll likely need to buy your own sand too, although this should be inexpensive."

If you make an hour\u2019s worth of mortar, it may dry out before you\u2019ve had time to use it. Start small: try only using about 1 cup (240 mL) of mortar to begin with. Either a bucket or wheelbarrow will give you plenty of space to mix the mortar in. If you need to make a large amount of mortar\u2014or are mixing far from the wall you\u2019ll be pointing\u2014opt for the wheelbarrow."

While there\u2019s some flexibility in the amount of sand you use relative to the amount of mortar, a 3:1 ratio is generally best for brick walls.

When mortar is the right consistency, it should be firm enough to hold its shape. The mortar should not slump or flow like a liquid. Add only a small amount of water at first. It\u2019s easy to pour more water into dry mortar, but if you add too much water all at once, you\u2019ll have to pour in much more mortar and sand to absorb all the extra water. If you're mixing the mortar in a wheelbarrow, mix the mortar using a front to back motion. To speed up the mixing process, use a mixing paddle attached to a drill to stir the mortar."

To make a weather struck bed joint, press your pointing trowel at an angle, so that the top edge is indented into the mortar and the lower edge is away from the wall. Then run the trowel along the mortar and press the joint into shape. A weather struck joint will protect your brick wall from absorbing water. The angle of the joint will deflect moisture and force rainwater to run down the surface of the bricks, rather than soaking into the mortar. Weather struck joints are only used on bed joints. There is no corresponding pointing angle for vertical joints. For a professional finish, smooth out the joint and surrounding area with a medium-soft mason brush when it's about halfway dry. Wait for the mortar to fully dry after this step. Give it at least another 30 minutes."
