Especially if the photo itself is dark, it\u2019s a good idea to differentiate the space between the photo and the frame. For example, if your frame is a deep mahogany wood and your picture is full of darker shades (like brown, gray, black, green, or purple), a white mat will really  draw the eye to the picture itself.Tip: If your picture also features a lot of white, make sure to match that shade to the color of the mat so that neither part looks faded or yellowed."

Similarly, you\u2019ll subtract the picture\u2019s width from the frame\u2019s width and divide that answer by 2 to determine where you need to cut for the width of the mat.

Use your metal ruler to mark off the entire square that needs to be removed to create the border for the picture. Use a pencil rather than a marker to make your notations.
