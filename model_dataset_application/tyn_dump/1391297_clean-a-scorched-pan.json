          "description":"Take your dirty pan, and add enough water to cover all of the scorched areas. You should add a two to three inches of additional water to the pan because some of it will evaporate when you heat it. Make sure to dry off the bottom of the pan after you\u2019re done filling it with water. You don\u2019t want to put it on the stove if there are drops of water that may fall onto the burner."

          "description":"Water alone isn\u2019t enough to remove scorch stains from your pan, so you\u2019ll need to add a cleansing agent to get rid of the burnt film. Squeeze three to four drops of your usual dish detergent into the water and swirl the mixture around to spread the soap throughout the water. For very stubborn scorch marks, you may want to use dishwashing detergent in place of liquid dish soap. You can use a single tablet, several drops of liquid, or 1 to 2 tablespoons of powdered dishwashing detergent."

Allow the water and dish detergent to boil for approximately 10 to 15 minutes to help loosen all of the debris from the bottom of the pan. Be sure to boil the water and dish detergent mixture, not just simmer it. You\u2019ll know that it\u2019s boiling when you see large bubbles rising from the bottom of the pan and it\u2019s giving off nearly constant steam."

          "description":"After you\u2019ve boiled the contents of the pan for approximately 10 minutes, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool completely, which should take approximately 20 minutes. Discard the water and detergent mixture -- you\u2019ll likely notice that the pan already looks a little cleaner. Next, scrub it with dish detergent and hot water to remove the burnt film and debris. You may need to use some type of scrubbing sponge or tool to remove all of the scorch marks. Steel wool pads are effective, but they often scratch the bottom of the pan, which may cause further damage. Sponges that are covered with plastic netting are an ideal alternative because they help scrub away scorch marks but won\u2019t scratch your pan.

Andrii Gurskyi\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Owner, Rainbow Cleaning Service\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Scrubbing the pan with a brillo pad can scratch and damage the finish of the pan, especially non-stick surfaces. The best method is to put dish soap and hot water in the pan and place it on a burner with medium heat. While it's hot, scrape at the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen the debris. If that doesn't work, you can try scrubbing the pan with dryer sheets."

You can also use cream of tartar in place of baking soda to clean a scorched pan. However, you should mix 1 tablespoon of the cream of tartar with 1 cup of water and omit the vinegar before adding it in the pan. While baking soda can work well on a stainless steel pan, you shouldn\u2019t use it or any other alkaline-based cleaning product on anodized aluminum cookware."

Use a sponge with plastic netting or brush to scrub at the bottom of pan, and remove the scorched debris. While it may help to use a sponge with netting or a scrub brush while you\u2019re washing the pan, the baking soda and boiling water should have sufficiently loosened the film and debris so it\u2019s easy to remove. If there are any stubborn scorch marks that won\u2019t scrub free, mix some baking soda with a few drops of water to form a paste. Apply it to the problem spots and allow it to sit for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before cleaning the pan as usual.

    "Once you\u2019re prepared to work with the oven cleaner, spray it over the scorched areas of the pan.",
