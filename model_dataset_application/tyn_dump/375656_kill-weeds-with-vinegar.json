          "description":"Go to your local grocery store and buy a bottle of basic vinegar, typically a 5% concentration of acetic acid. The best bargain is probably to buy a one gallon jug unless you only have a few weeds. If you are killing a lot of weeds, you may need to buy more than one gallon, but one gallon will cover a large area. The acid in vinegar is what kills the weeds. White vinegar is most recommended, and probably the cheapest, but you can use apple cider vinegar as well."

        {
          "headline":"Pour the mixture into a garden sprayer.",
          "description":"Choosing a pump sprayer with a hose and long nozzle will make spraying large areas of weeds easier. Fill the sprayer up with the vinegar and dish soap mixture, or put as much in the sprayer as you\u2019ll need. Another option is to pour the mixture into an empty spray bottle. You can buy an empty bottle or you can use a bottle that used to contain window cleaner or another gentle household cleaner. Make sure to rinse it out well if you use a bottle that had other liquid in it. If you are only killing a few weeds, or covering a small area, you can poke four or five holes in the cap of the vinegar bottle and use the bottle to douse the weeds. If you\u2019re using horticultural vinegar, which has an acidity of 30%, dilute it with water. If you\u2019re using regular white vinegar, you won\u2019t need to dilute it."

          "description":"The acetic acid in vinegar dries weeds out, so applying vinegar on a day when the weeds will get at least a few hours of direct sunlight increases the drying power of the vinegar. Spray in the morning so the weeds can get lots of sun. If it rains unexpectedly shortly after you spray the weeds, you\u2019ll most likely have to apply a second round of vinegar. In this case, sunny means hot as well, ideally in the range of 70+ degrees."

Cover the leaves with vinegar, but also spray down around the roots. You don\u2019t need to soak them so they are dripping wet but spray an even coat. Wait around 24 hours and check the weeds. If you aren\u2019t satisfied, you can spray the weeds a second time."

Vinegar shouldn\u2019t soak into the soil and kill other plants unless it makes direct contact with them."

When using stronger vinegar, it is advised to take extra caution such as wearing gloves and goggles. Most weeds will die with regular vinegar, so use that first and only use horticultural vinegar if regular doesn\u2019t work.

The dish soap will help the vinegar stick to the weeds and not run off. Gently stir the soap into the vinegar, but don\u2019t shake the bottle too much or the soap will get sudsy rather than mixing into the vinegar.

Use cheap table salt rather than rock salt, Epsom salt, or sea salt. Salt tends to stay in the soil for a while and can have long-term effects on healthy plant life. If you are killing weeds in an area where you\u2019ll plant again, it is probably best to avoid the salt. On the other hand, if you are killing weeds in an area that you want to prevent future growth, salt can help achieve this. It is especially important to clean a sprayer in which you added salt because it will clog up the parts and can even corrode the sprayer."
