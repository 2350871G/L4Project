Do not use a paint sprayer or spray paint cans for the rust inhibitor, because they will not reach into all the tiny pores on the steel's surface. This is more important than the top coat because it will slow down the oxidizing process in the future. You can also use an anti-rust enamel paint over 1 coat of regular primer."

      "headline":"Paint your steel surface with 2 coats of outdoor paint, since most steel is kept outside.",
      "description":"You can choose a matte, semi-gloss or glossy finish, according to your preference. Use a brush or paint roller to apply the exterior paint, if you want to ensure you reach every crevice of the steel. Hold a brush at the base of the handle to ensure you have good control of your brush strokes. Use spray paint, if you want to ensure there is an even coat. Make sure you hold the can at the proper distance, as indicated by the directions on the can. Spray parallel to the object, moving your hand back and forth in smooth motions during application. This will provide a professional-looking finish and avoid drips on the steel surface."
