          "description":"Leave these drinks in the freezer until they are nearly frozen, but still 100% liquid. You want your drinks to become very cold in the freezer, but not solid or slushy. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours depending on the strength of your freezer, so frequently check on your beer to make sure it hasn't frozen in the bottle. If you leave your bottles in the freezer for too long, the liquid inside will eventually freeze solid. Since water expands when it freezes, this can cause the bottles to crack or rupture. This is why it's recommended to use several bottles - if you lose one bottle, you may still be able to use another. Drinks with clear bottles work best for this trick because they allow an unhindered view of the liquid inside the bottle."

You don't want to use a surface that can scratch, break, or mar easily, so avoid wood and softer metals. Set any bottles that have frozen solid aside."

If you're having trouble getting this trick to work, your liquid may not be cold enough. Return your bottle to the freezer and try again later.

Basically, when you leave your beer in your freezer for long enough, it actually drops below its freezing temperature. However, because the inside of the bottle is perfectly smooth, there is nothing for ice crystals to form against, so the beer stays as a \"supercooled\" liquid for a while. When you smack the bottle against your hard surface, bubbles form, as they would in any carbonated liquid. These bubbles give the ice crystals something to \"grab on to\" on the molecular level, so, if you look closely, you should actually see ice radiate outwards from the bubbles throughout the liquid. Now that you understand how this trick works, use it to amaze your friends! Or, if you're at the bar, make a show of it and use it to win free drinks from other patrons!"

          "description":"If you're less interested in the party trick above than you are in getting your beers chilled at the last minute for a party, try dropping your drinks into a mixture of ice, water, and salt. Use about 1 cup of salt for every three pounds of ice you use. If you want your drinks to cool as quickly as possible, use as much ice as you can, but be sure to add enough water so that the mixture retains its liquid property. Liquid water comes into contact with the entire surface area of the bottle or can, rather than touching it at points, like solid ice chunks would, reducing the time that it takes to cool the drink. Salt further shortens the cooling process. When salt dissolves in water, it dissociates into its component elements - Sodium and Chloride. It takes energy from the water to do this, which causes the temperature of the water to lower. Note that the thicker and more insulated of container you use to contain your salted ice water, the better it will retain its coldness."

As an added bonus, the evaporation of the water in the rag will have a further cooling effect on the drink. Don't forget your beers in the freezer!

Though quick and convenient, this method has several drawbacks - it's unlikely to cool a drink to as low of temperature as the other methods in this article and will only work effectively for the first drink you pour into the glass. It also requires you to keep a supply of glasses or mugs in the refrigerator for your beverage emergencies, which can be a non-starter if fridge space is at a premium. It's tempting to put glasses in the freezer to get them even colder than the fridge allows, but only do so with caution. Rapid drops in temperature can cause glassware to crack or shatter. A better bet is to use plastic cups and mugs specially-designed for chilling in the freezer, which often feature a layer of freeze-able liquid for a long-lasting cooling effect."
