At the beginning of the growing season, look for the central, vertical branch at the plant\u2019s center. Select 3 or 4 of the side branches to keep as leaders.

Even though the plant will be a lot taller, it's growth won\u2019t be thick enough yet. Find the 3 or 4 branches you saved earlier, then use loppers to sever the longest branches around it. Leave a few of the smaller, younger shoots on each main branch. Cutting off the oldest, longest side shoots can cause more thick growth around the main branches."
