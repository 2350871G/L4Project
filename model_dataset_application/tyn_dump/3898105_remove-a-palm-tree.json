    "Palm tree nurseries and tree removal services can help identify your palm tree and its value.",
    "Assess which way the tree should fall.",
    "Stand where you ideally want the palm tree to fall.",
    "This should be away from power lines, buildings, and other trees.",
    "Detect the tree\u2019s lean by looking along the trunk to the branches.",
    "View the tree at other angles as needed to figure out the lean, as well as spot any signs of damage that could change the palm's trajectory.",
    "Check the local regulations before you begin to make sure you follow all laws on tree removal.",
    "Plan on bringing the tree down in the direction of the lean.",
    "If this isn\u2019t possible, guide the tree by digging out about 24 in (61 cm) of soil around the roots in the direction you want the tree to fall.",
    "Make sure the tree\u2019s fronds aren\u2019t tangled up in power lines or anything else that will fall with the tree.",

    "Mark a circle around the base of the tree.",
    "Measure the tree\u2019s width to make an estimate of the root ball.",
    "Expect the root ball to be twice as wide as the tree, up to about 24 in (61 cm) in diameter.",
    "Mark this by drawing a circle around the tree with spray chalk.",
    "Roots spread out more in taller palm trees.",
    "Trees over 16 ft (4.9 m) may have root balls larger than 24 in (61 cm) in diameter.",
    "If you plan on transferring or replanting the tree, you may want to make the circle 30 in (76 cm) or larger to avoid damaging larger roots.",
    "Dig inwards from the edge of the circle.",
    "Dig around the edge of the circle first, moving the dirt until you can see the bottom of the root balls.",
    "Palm trees have a lot of small, stringy roots that don\u2019t spread as far as roots from other trees.",
    "Once you have located the ends of the roots, begin working towards the tree trunk until you expose the top of the root ball.",
    "Although palm trees need most of their roots in order to be replanted successfully, a little bit of root damage won\u2019t kill the tree.",
    "A crane may also be rented and used to dig underneath the root ball without harming the palm tree.",
    "Sever long or stubborn roots with a shovel.",

    "Do not stand underneath the tree on the side it falls towards.",
    "As long as you avoid sawing off the top of the trunk or cutting a lot of roots, the tree can be replanted elsewhere in a hole deep enough to cover the root ball.",
    "If the tree is large, you will need a crane to move it after it falls.",
    "After it's replanted, it'll need aftercare, such as regular watering, to ensure it takes root.",
    "Cutting down the Tree Search for your palm tree online to find out if its worth cutting.",
    "Common palm tree varieties, such as the Mexican Fan Palm, cost more to transplant than they do to remove.",
    "You can check this by taking a picture, searching through a palm tree database online, and by contacting a tree nursery or removal service for confirmation.",
    "If the tree isn\u2019t valuable and you don\u2019t want to save it, you can safely cut it down.",

    "A harness or hydraulic lift is necessary for trees approximately 12 ft (3.7 m) or taller.",
    "Attach the harness to the tree or another stable structure, such as a nearby building.",
    "You can purchase a harness online or at a home improvement store.",

    "It is most likely to fall in the direction it is leaning.",
    "Make sure the tree is clear of any power lines and won\u2019t fall on anything else.",
    "Make sure you are in accordance with local regulations on tree removal, and contact a professional if your palm is near obstacles like power lines.",
    "If you can\u2019t fell the tree in the direction it is leaning, you will need to make a deeper notch cut in the direction you want it to fall towards.",
    "Cut about \u2153 of the way into the tree\u2019s trunk.",
    "If the tree has cracks or holes, it could fall towards the damaged spots.",

    "Always be aware of your surroundings.",
    "Have a way to escape in case the tree begins to crack, splinter, or fall towards you.",
    "Climb up to reach the tree fronds.",
    "If the tree is short enough, you can reach the leaves by using a ladder.",
    "Position the ladder next to the branch you wish to cut so it doesn\u2019t fall on you.",
    "Otherwise, climb up on a nearby structure or use a hydraulic lift so you are above the fronds.",
    "Stand beside or above the palm fronds when trimming them.",
    "Never stand under them.",
    "Ask a helper to watch the tree to look for splintering or the tree falling in the wrong direction.",
    "For example, the person holding your ladder may be able to watch the tree.",
    "You may be able to rent a hydraulic lift from a home improvement store.",
    "Trim the palm fronds with a pruning saw.",
    "Use the saw to cut through the palm fronds 1 at a time.",
    "Cut each frond as close to the tree\u2019s trunk as possible.",
    "You can use a chainsaw, although fronds are often tough and will wear out several blades.",
    "Change your chainsaw blade when it no longer cuts through the branches cleanly.",
    "Let the cut branches drop to the ground.",
    "Make sure no one is standing under the tree while you work.",
    "If you cannot cut the fronds, you can cut the whole tree down at once.",
    "However, remember that the fronds make the tree heavier and can affect how it falls.",
    "The wind will effect the direction that the tree falls, especially if there are still fronds on the tree.",
    "Make a notch cut at the tree\u2019s base.",
    "Use a proper cutting technique to control the direction of the tree\u2019s fall.",
    "Make a triangular cut on the side you want the tree to fall towards.",
    "To make the cut, use a chainsaw to slice diagonally down about 1/4 of the way through the tree, then pull the saw back out of the trunk.",
    "Make the cut at waist or chest-level to minimize the size of the stump left after felling the palm.",
    "If you aren\u2019t comfortable felling the tree, you can use the chainsaw to cut the tree from the top.",
    "Cut off about 12 in (30 cm) at a time until only a stump remains.",
    "Cut through the tree from the other side.",
    "Go around to the other side of the tree and use your chainsaw to cut straight through it.",
    "Saw through the tree until you reach the tip of the notch cut you made.",
    "Quickly move away from the tree when you hear cracking.",
    "The tree will most likely fall towards the notch cut.",
    "You may need to replace the chainsaw blade a few times to cut all the way through the tree.",
    "Use a stump grinder to remove the rest of the tree.",
    "Rent a power stump grinder to take out the remaining piece of the palm tree.",
    "You will need to cut down through the stump, removing it piece by piece.",
    "This can take a lot of effort, so be patient and whittle the stump down slowly.",
    "You will need to dig around the stump to expose the part in the ground.",
    "To make the stump easier to remove, you can apply a potassium nitrate tree stump killer."
