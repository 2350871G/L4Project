You will need to use your free hand to uncouple these wires, twisting the wiring cap to free the wires from each other. Hot wires are those that run electricity to your fixtures and grounding wires are intended to offer surge electricity a neutral point, like the earth, into which it can dissipate. In some cases, a grounding wire might be attached to the mounting bracket itself, rather than a house wire. This is fairly common in new light fixtures."
