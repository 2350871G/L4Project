You can also boil your eggs by placing them in a pot of cold water, bringing the water to a boil, then removing the pot from the heat and letting them sit in the water for 9-15 minutes. If you boil your eggs for 8 minutes you should have firm egg whites and a golden yolk. Boiling your eggs for 12 minutes will give you a fully hard-boiled yolk. Boiling your eggs for 14 minutes or longer will give you a chalky, crumbly yolk."
