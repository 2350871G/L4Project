After dumping the alcohol, pour a lot of water down the drain to dilute the alcohol.You may want to wear eye glasses and gloves when you flush the rubbing alcohol. If you pour 1 cup (240 mL) of rubbing alcohol down the drain, be sure to flush it out with 10 to 20 cups (2,400 to 4,700 mL) of water afterwards. Never pour rubbing alcohol into a storm sewer. Many standard rubbing alcohol containers are over 50% concentrated, so this option might not work for everyone."
