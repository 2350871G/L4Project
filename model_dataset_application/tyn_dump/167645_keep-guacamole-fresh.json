  "text":" Using Sour Cream Transfer the guacamole to the smallest bowl it will fit in. Try to leave no more than \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) of space between the guacamole and the bowl's rim. Smooth out the surface of the guacamole with a spoon, making it as flat as possible. This will make it easier to spread the sour cream on top\u2014and scrape the sour cream off later. Spread a thin layer of sour cream over the surface of the guacamole. Keep adding the sour cream until you can't see the guacamole anymore. The sour cream will create a \"seal\" between the guacamole the air and keep it from turning brown. Wrap a sheet of plastic wrap over the sour cream.

When you are ready to eat the guacamole, scrape the soul cream off, or stir it in for a creamier dip. Using Water Transfer the guacamole into a container with a tight-fitting lid. Make sure that there is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of space between the guacamole and the rim of the container. Try to pack the guacamole as tightly as you can so that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the surface of the guacamole. You can use the bowl of a spoon or a spatula. Make sure that there are no bumps, ridges, or ripples. Add about \u00bd inch of lukewarm water.

Avocadoes have a very high fat content, which helps them repel water. Cover the container with the lid, and put it into the fridge. The guacamole will be good for up to three days. Pour the water out when you are ready to use the guacamole. If you need to, give the guacamole a quick stir. This will help blend in any excess moisture into the rest of the guacamole. Using Plastic Wrap Transfer the guacamole to the smallest bowl it will fit in. Try to leave no more than \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) of space between the guacamole and the bowl's rim.
