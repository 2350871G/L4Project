Always snip in line with the grain of your fabric. In other words, look carefully at the fabric, determine which way the fibers run, and cut in the same direction. This ensures that your fabric will tear easily and evenly. Grasp the fabric on either side of the snip and pull it apart. Cotton, in particular, will tear easily along the grain. Tear the fabric to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the opposite edge. You can tear all the way through the edge of the fabric, but you'll end up with a pile of strips that you have to knot or sew together. If you stop 1 inch away from the edge, you can create 1 long strip of fabric from any square or rectangular piece. Turn the fabric around and make another snip to start a new tear, 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches (1.25 to 3.75 cm) away from the previous tear. The heavier your fabric is, the wider the strips you should tear. Grasp both sides of the snip you just made and tear again. Use even, controlled force to make a smooth tear, and stop 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the far side of the fabric (this is the edge you first started tearing from). Make another snip in the far side of the fabric, the same width away from the last tear as the one before that.  Continue ripping back and forth across the fabric, stopping about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edge with each tear you make. The result is 1 long, continuous zig-zag piece of fabric.
