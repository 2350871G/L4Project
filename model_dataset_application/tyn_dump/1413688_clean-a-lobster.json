Transfer it to an ice bath as soon as it's done cooking, and you're ready to process it. If your recipe calls for raw lobster meat, instead put the live lobster on its belly and kill it humanely with a small, sharp knife where the head meets the body. Clean the raw lobster as described below, but do it over a bowl to catch raw juices, and rinse the meat before cooking it. See these instructions for frozen lobster."
