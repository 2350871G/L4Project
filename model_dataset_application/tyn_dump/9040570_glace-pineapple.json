Slice the pineapple into rings and use a pastry cutter to stamp out the cores from each ring. You should get about 1 pound (453 g) of prepared pineapple rings. If you'd like to save time, you can use canned pineapple rings instead of cutting up the fresh fruit. You can also slice the pineapple into cubes.
