Smaller vegetables like baby carrots or Brussels sprouts don't have to be chopped, but you can if you prefer to. You don't have to peel vegetables to steam them. Unless you don't like skin on your vegetables, leave the skin on, because it usually contains some essential nutrients.

    "Place the skillet in the oven and cook the fish for 15-20 minutes.",
    "This is an average time for average-sized fish fillets.",
    "If you're cooking a whole fish, then allow 30-40 minutes for the fish to cook all the way through.",
    "You can use any rack in the oven for this meal.",
    "If you're not sure how to judge when a fish is ready, use a thermometer.",
    "Wait until the fish's internal temperature is 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) to indicate that it's finished.",
    "Remove the fish and serve it after it cools.",
    "Use a thick oven mitt to take the skillet out because it will be very hot.",
    "Place the skillet on the stove top and let it cool for a few minutes.",
    "Then, carefully unwrap the foil tent and transfer the fish onto a plate to serve it.",
    "You can add some more seasonings after the fish is cooked like salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice.",
    "Also steam some vegetables for a full, steamed meal."
