Plywood skins are available at any hardware store or home improvement center. You can also get them from the same company who manufactured your cabinet or shelving units to make sure they're a match.

Most water-based interior latex paints dry to the touch within an hour, and can be painted over in 4-6. Use strips of painter's tape to protect any nearby areas you don't paint to get on.
