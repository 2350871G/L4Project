Also, make sure the day and time you choose does not conflict with any big events. If you would like to provide a meal, lunch or dinner-time are good options. If you are planning on serving alcoholic drinks, during or after happy hour (usually 4:30 PM and after) would be most appropriate."

          "description":"When hosting a party, you will have the most say and ability to do the party the way you want to if you host it at your own home. This option is also more budget-friendly. If you would rather not worry about the prep and clean-up afterward, consider renting a venue. Many hotels and restaurants rent out their spaces for large groups. However, make sure you let the venue know you are planning to host a paint party so they can say whether or not their space can accommodate such an activity."

          "description":"Choose a number of guests knowing that not all of them will be able to make it. Also consider how much space you have when it comes to placing the painting stations, tools, food, and drinks. You don't want all of your guests squished together, especially when they will need room to be creative with their paintings! Send invitations to your guests. You can do this via mail, email, or even Facebook. Online options (like email and Facebook) will allow your guests to receive, and respond to, your invitations faster. On your invitations, include the date, time, location, RSVP instructions, whether or not they can bring guests, and any cost you may expect them to pay. Although it is customary for the host to pick up the tab for food and drinks, , you will also be paying for all of the art supplies. That being said, you may consider each guest paying at least $5 to make up for the cost of supplies. After all, they will be leaving your party with a great piece of art. If you choose to ask for payment from guests, websites and apps like PayPal or VenMo are good options to easily accept and track payment."

With many utensils, tools, and other supplies taking up space, you want your food to be simple and organized. Finger food like chicken fingers, cheese and crackers, pigs in a blanket, and bite sized snacks are all good options. Consider your budget. Costs for a party can add up quickly! Buying food from a grocery store will be much cheaper than ordering food from a restaurant. If you are expecting many guests, preparing the food yourself would be more cost efficient. However, if you are having a small group attend, treating your friends to pre-made food from your favorite restaurant may be your choice."

Also, if you have a theme in mind, consider choosing drinks that go along with it to tie it all together! If you are serving alcohol, think about what your guests prefer. Wine drinkers would appreciate a variety of reds, whites, and even roses to choose from. Similarly, have several types of beer on hand such as wheats, stouts, and IPAs. For guests who prefer cocktails, having a variety of liquor (vodka, rum, gin, whiskey) and mixers available will ensure you can make many different types of drinks. If you anticipate hosting guests who are under the age of 21, make sure there are several types of juices and soda so they have something fun to sip on, too!"
