Glue each panel of fabric/paper to each side, one at a time. The box can be the same color/pattern on the inside as on the outside, or completely different. You also don't need to cover the inside-bottom part of the box, as it will be covered. If you are using fabric, try something with a pattern, such as calico or gingham.

There are a few other types of scissors that might make more advanced sewing projects easier, however:\nPinking shears are like fabric scissors, but with a zigzag edge. Edges cut with these scissors are less likely to fray. Rotary cutters are great for cutting long, straight lines. You'll want a self-healing cutting matt for one of these as well. Thread snips are great for snipping thread close to the fabric when you are machine sewing. Embroidery scissors are tiny scissors perfect for hand-embroidery projects. They are able to cut your thread close to the fabric and are easily portable."

You will likely come across a few projects that will require just a regular needle and thread. Sewing pins are also important. Consider getting a pack of them; one can never have too many. If you own a sewing machine, consider including replacement needles for your sewing machine. You can also include different types of needles for different weights of fabric, such as jean, cotton, and shear. Pincushions are great for sticking pins into during your sewing project. You can have a standard ball-shaped pincushion, or one of those with a band that you can strap to your wrist. Thimbles are useful for those who are clumsy when it comes to hand sewing. They will spare you lots of painful, pricked fingers. Needle threaders are great for those who have poor eyesight, unsteady hands, or are working with very tiny needles. They look like coins, but with a thin, metal loop attached to it."

Here are some suggestions:\nMeasuring tape is always useful to have around, not just for sewing. It is essential for those who work with patterns. They help you get the measurements right the first time around and lessen the chances of mistakes. Seam rippers make undoing mistakes a lot easier and quicker. They are great for those who work with sewing machines and need to undo a lot of tiny, tight stitches. Point turners are small tools ideal for pushing out points and corners. They are ideal for those who sew cuffs, collars, bags, and other items with tight corners. Grommet setters and other setters are essential for those who will be working with grommets, eyelets, and other types of fasteners. Tailors chalk or water soluble markers are perfect for those who like to draft their own patterns, or who need to make alterations. Fray check glue, while not essential, it great when you are sewing with delicate fabrics that fray easily."

Roll up larger items, such as ribbon, lace, elastic, and zippers, before stuffing them into the compartments. For ideas on what to fill your box with, click here. Consider decorating the lid of your box. Your box doesn't have strong enough clasps, so a handle might not be a good idea, but you can still make the box look pretty on top. Glue on some sewing-related notion on the lid, such as buttons, lace, ribbon, and pretty brooches. Here are some more decorating ideas:\nCover the top part with some pretty scrapbook paper. Write your name on the lid using glitter glue. Glue some ribbon or an old measuring tape around the edges. Filling Your Box Include some basic sewing supplies. Every sewing box should include some basics, including a pair of fabric scissors, some needles, and thread. Depending on the size of your box, you could include more or fewer items. This section will give you some suggestions. Consider choosing a variety of scissors. Basic fabric scissors are a must. They are great for beginners and those who just plan on cutting fabric and snipping thread. There are a few other types of scissors that might make more advanced sewing projects easier, however:\nPinking shears are like fabric scissors, but with a zigzag edge. Edges cut with these scissors are less likely to fray. Rotary cutters are great for cutting long, straight lines. You'll want a self-healing cutting matt for one of these as well. Thread snips are great for snipping thread close to the fabric when you are machine sewing. Embroidery scissors are tiny scissors perfect for hand-embroidery projects. They are able to cut your thread close to the fabric and are easily portable. Include some needles and pins. Sewing needles are essential, even if you only plan on using your sewing machine. You will likely come across a few projects that will require just a regular needle and thread. Sewing pins are also important. Consider getting a pack of them; one can never have too many. If you own a sewing machine, consider including replacement needles for your sewing machine. You can also include different types of needles for different weights of fabric, such as jean, cotton, and shear. Pincushions are great for sticking pins into during your sewing project. You can have a standard ball-shaped pincushion, or one of those with a band that you can strap to your wrist. Thimbles are useful for those who are clumsy when it comes to hand sewing. They will spare you lots of painful, pricked fingers. Needle threaders are great for those who have poor eyesight, unsteady hands, or are working with very tiny needles. They look like coins, but with a thin, metal loop attached to it. Have a variety of thread. Thread might seem like a no-brainer, but it might be a good idea to have an assortment of thread, such as standard thread and heavy-duty thread. Some sewing projects will require strong, thick thread. Standard thread\nHeavy duty thread\nEmbroidery thread\nLight, medium, and dark colors for repairs. Try including some notions. Even if you are not an advanced seamstress or tailor, having a few notions, such as buttons, might be a good idea. They are great for repairs and last minute arts and crafts projects. Here's a list to give you some ideas:\nButtons, hooks, and fasteners\nRibbon and lace\nHem tape and bias tape\nElastic\nFusible interfacing\nSafety pins Consider including some other useful tools. If you do a lot of sewing, you might find certain items quite useful. It all depends on what you usually sew. Here are some suggestions:\nMeasuring tape is always useful to have around, not just for sewing. It is essential for those who work with patterns. They help you get the measurements right the first time around and lessen the chances of mistakes. Seam rippers make undoing mistakes a lot easier and quicker. They are great for those who work with sewing machines and need to undo a lot of tiny, tight stitches. Point turners are small tools ideal for pushing out points and corners. They are ideal for those who sew cuffs, collars, bags, and other items with tight corners. Grommet setters and other setters are essential for those who will be working with grommets, eyelets, and other types of fasteners. Tailors chalk or water soluble markers are perfect for those who like to draft their own patterns, or who need to make alterations. Fray check glue, while not essential, it great when you are sewing with delicate fabrics that fray easily.",

    "Glue the small boxes down.",
    "Start on one side, in the corner, and work your way to the other.",
    "Spread a thin layer of liquid glue (such as tacky of school glue) over the bottom and sides of the little box, and press it down.",

    "Clean the box, then paint it.",
    "Wash the box with soap and warm water, and dry it off.",

    "This will hold your scissors.",

    "For example, if your fabric is blue, use a red ribbon.",
    "Wait for everything to dry, then fill the box.",
