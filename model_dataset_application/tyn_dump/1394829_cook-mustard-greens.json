You can finish preparing your mustard greens while your broth comes to a boil. Incorporate \u00bd a cup (75 g) of saut\u00e9d onion or cubed pork belly into your simmering broth to add even more flavor. For more traditional Southern-style greens, you can also make your own stock by simmering a whole ham hock in 10\u201312 cups (2.4\u20132.8 L) water for 2-5 hours."

Mustard greens grow in the ground, so it\u2019s important to make sure they\u2019ve been cleaned properly before cooking and eating them. After rinsing your greens, give them a shake or pat them dry with a paper towel to absorb any remaining moisture. If you\u2019re cooking a lot of greens at once, it may be easier to swish them through a sink full of water to clean them all at once.

You can also simply tear them away by hand. The stems tend to be tough, which means they\u2019re not good for eating. Avoid taking off too much of the dark, usable part of the greens.
