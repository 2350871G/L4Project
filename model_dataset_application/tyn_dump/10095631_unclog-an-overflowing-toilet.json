    "Pull the snake out of the toilet.",
    "If the clog was caused by a cloth, toy, or another object, the snake may drag it out the pipe.",
    "It may also bring back some waste or toilet paper if those were responsible for the clog.",
    "At least you can look at the end of the wire to see if it made contact with the clog.",
    "If the wire is clean and empty, it may not have reached the clog.",
    "Lower it back into the hole slowly to make sure it goes down the drain.",
    "Clean the snake off with soap and water.",
    "Move the wire end of the snake to your sink.",
    "Turn on the hot water to rinse the snake and wash it off with disinfecting soap.",
    "Finish drying it off with a paper towel.",
    "Plunge the toilet if the clog isn\u2019t completely gone.",
    "Put your plunger over the toilet\u2019s drainage exit.",
    "If there is no water in the toilet, you will need to flush the toilet or open the flapper to add some.",
    "Make sure the plunger fits over the whole, creating a good seal before you begin using it.",
    "The plunger should be able to force water down the pipe, lowering the water level in the bowl as it breaks up any clogs still in the pipe.",
    "If the water completely drains from the bowl, plunging is optional.",
    "However, plunging 2 to 5 times is recommended to force out any clogging material still lingering in the pipes.",
    "Flush the toilet to clear out the exit pipe.",
    "Give the toilet a good flush to make sure it works correctly.",
    "You may need to do this a couple of times before the water drains normally.",
    "Any remaining material from the clog will likely be swept away as the water flows.",
    "If the toilet is still clogged, try snaking the drain and plunging again.",
    "If you can\u2019t clear the clog at all, it may be deeper in the drain.",
    "You will have to call a plumber."
