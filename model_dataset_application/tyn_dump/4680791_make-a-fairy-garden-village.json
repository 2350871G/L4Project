Or, simply stick to the purchased items if preferred. Things you can purchase include miniature fairy houses, ceramic fairies, ceramic pieces such as a well, a swing or a tower and doll house items of all sorts. The main thing is to only use items that can withstand being outdoors and getting weathered. Some suggestions for locating items include:\nVisit charity, thrift and used goods stores. Many miniature items can be found in such places for a bargain price, and you can have lots of fun rummaging about for the best pieces. Check out hobby or toy stores, including ones online. Look for fairy designed items and for doll house things. See what crafters have to offer on sites such as Etsy, eBay and their own personal online stores. You might find some lovely items for sale that are just perfect for your fairy garden village."
