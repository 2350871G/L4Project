Tap the center of the covered pane with a hammer and pull out the remaining shards. Scrape away the old putty with a painter's tool. The putty might need to be softened with a heat gun, which you should hold 1 inch (2.5 cm) away. Pry the old metal glazing points out of the \"rabbets.\" These are the grooves in which the glass sits. Scrape and sandpaper the rabbets until they are smooth, bare wood. Then, brush them with an exterior primer. Press putty into the rabbets once the primer dries. You can warm and soften a handful of putty by kneading it in your hands. Set and center a new pane into the putty. Apply even pressure on all sides as you wiggle it into place. There should be about 1/8 inch (3 mm) of putty between the face of the glass and the rabbet. Install a glazier's point to hold the glass in place. Use a putty knife to slide a glazier's point into the center of each side of the pane, sticking the point into the wood. Turn the sash over and scrape off the putty that has squeezed out to that side.  Knead and warm a handful of putty into a long rope that is about 3/4 inch (19 mm) in diameter.  Set the putty rope around the edges of the glass on each side. Press it firmly against the rabbets. Spread and smooth out the putty with a putty knife. Start at the top right corner and hold the blade at a 45-degree angle to the glass. The tip of the blade should point at the top edge of the corner, with the knife's corner on the glass.
