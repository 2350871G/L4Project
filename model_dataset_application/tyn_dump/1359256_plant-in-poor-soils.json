Make your own compost out of decaying organic matter, such as dead leaves or manure, or purchase some from a gardening store. Add in additional amendments to the compost if your soil has specific issues, such as a high or low pH level. Add sand and pea gravel if the soil is too moist, dolomitic lime if it's too acidic, or elemental sulfur if it's too alkaline. A soil pH kit can help you determine if your soil is alkaline or acidic. Most plants prefer a pH between 5.5 and 7. You can purchase soil pH kits at your local garden store or online."
