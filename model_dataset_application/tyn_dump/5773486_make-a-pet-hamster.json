Remove droppings (these could be made from modeling clay), uneaten food and soiled bedding (use garden straw or grass) every day. Every week, remove and replace all the bedding, and scrub the bottom of the cage with hot, soapy water. Show your parents how well you are caring for your handmade pet hamster.
