To make enough alum for several dozen sheets of paper, stir 1 tbsp (15 mL) alum into 1\u00bd cups (360 mL) warm water until completely dissolved, at least two minutes. Buy pure aluminum sulfate from an art supply store or online. Do not use alum sold as a spice. This is usually a related chemical compound that may damage the paper. Keep alum out of reach of children. It is not dangerous to handle, but can dry the skin and irritate the nose when inhaled. Wear gloves or wash hands after handling, and avoid inhaling the powder."

Stir in one drop at a time, testing in between, until a drop of paint float on the surface and spreads out slowly. Stir in more if the drop rapidly spreads to more than 3 inches (7.5 cm). Old-fashioned ox gall will not work with acrylic paints. Use a detergent-based marbling gall that does not contain animal products. This is also sold as surfactant or dispersant.

This is by far the easiest option to set up, but most experienced marbling artists use other materials. See below for alternatives if you get poor results from starch, or if starch is not available in your area. Creating the Pattern Skim the liquid surface with a strip of newspaper. This will break the surface tension, and remove dust and air bubbles. Pop remaining bubbles with a pin. Mix your paint with gall or oil. Arrange a small cup or dish for each color of acrylic paint.

Too much stirring will cause the colors to blend and become murky. Stop if you notice the borders between the colors becoming less distinct. Decorating the Paper Lower the paper onto the starch.
