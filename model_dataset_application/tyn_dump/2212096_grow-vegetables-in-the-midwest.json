Plants that grow well in any part of the Midwest include carrots, beets, lettuce, peas, and potatoes. If you live in zones 2 or 3, choose hardy vegetables like asparagus, spinach, turnips, or onions. Higher zones, such as zones 5-6, can handle more tender vegetables, like cucumber or pumpkin."

Look for an area that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight per day, since many vegetables require direct sunlight. If you live in the lower zones or if you don\u2019t have a yard, consider container gardening. In a container garden, the plants remain in a large pot instead of being planted in the ground. If you're just starting out, mark off a plot about 10 by 10 feet (3.0 m \u00d7 3.0 m) in size. This will allow you to grow roughly 3-5 different vegetables. As you get more experienced, you can expand your garden."

Buy a soil testing kit at a garden store or take a soil sample to your local extension office. There are several ways to fix problematic soil. Average pH in the Midwest can vary anywhere from 5, which is acidic, to 7.5, which is very alkaline. If the pH is too low, amend the soil with lime. If it is too high, mix sulfur into the soil. If your soil\u2019s nutrient quality is poor, mix manure or compost into the soil. This might also help improve drainage.

In zones 5-6, the first frost usually occurs in September or October. The last frost typically occurs in March or April. Read the packet of your seeds to see how you should start your seedlings.

    "To plant each seedling, dig a hole that is slightly larger than your seedling\u2019s pot.",
    "Carefully remove the seedling with its roots and place it into the hole.",
    "Spread soil around the seedling with your hands, then place a layer of mulch or chopped straw around the plant.",
    "Transplant the seedling to a larger pot for a container garden.",
    "Select a large pot or container so that your vegetable has room to grow.",
    "The size of the pot may vary based on the vegetable.",
    "Broccoli, for example, needs a 5 gallon (19 liter) box while tomato plants need large bushel baskets.",
    "Fill the container with potting soil.",
    "Make a hole slightly larger than the seedling\u2019s pot.",
    "Move the seedling into the hole and spread the potting soil around the seedling.",
    "Keep the pots outside on a porch, balcony, or other sunny area.",
    "Water and fertilize the seedlings after transplanting.",
    "Whether you move them outdoors or to a larger pot, the seedlings need water and nutrients.",
    "Water the area thoroughly with a hose or watering can.",
    "Apply 8 ounces (230 g) of 15-30-15 liquid fertilizer to each seedling.",
    "Continue to water the plant daily according to its needs.",
    "Each vegetable requires a different amount of water each week.",
    "The best time to water plants is in the morning.",
    "Sowing Seeds Outdoors Mark off rows for your seedlings.",
    "In your garden, establish each row by putting 2 wooden stakes down, 1 at each end of the row.",
    "Tie a string between these stakes to create a straight line.",
    "Take your spade and dig a trench directly below the string.",
    "Read the seed packet to see how deep the trench needs to be.",
    "Small seeds, like carrots, may only need to be 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) deep while others, like corn, may need to be 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep.",
    "Keep each row roughly 1 foot (0.30 m) apart.",
    "Some vegetables, like cauliflower or broccoli, may need more room than this.",
    "Look up recommendations for row spacing for your vegetables.",
    "Spread seeds in the trench.",
    "Some vegetables, such as beans and okra, need 3-4 seeds per 1 foot (0.30 m).",
    "Others, such as lettuce or beets, may need up to 10 seeds per 1 foot (0.30 m).",
    "When you have finished the row, push soil over on top of the seeds with your hands.",
    "As always check your seed packet to see how many sees you need per 1 foot (0.30 m).",
    "Remeber that you can always thin out your seedlings once they begin to grow, so don't worry about starting with too many seeds.",
    "Water the seeds daily.",
    "Look up how much water your specific vegetable needs.",
    "Water the seeds using a watering can or a garden hose.",
    "As the seeds start to grow, continue to water them.",
    "Remove weaker seedlings after the seedlings sprout.",
    "Look for any thin, small, or drooping seedlings that are failing to thrive.",
    "Remove these weak seedlings by cutting them away with shears or scissors.",
    "Thinning out your seedlings will help the stronger and larger seedlings get more nutrients to grow.",
    "Thin the vegetables so that there is enough space between each remaining seedling.",
    "Typically, you should leave around 1 foot (0.30 m) between each plant, but this can vary by vegetable.",
    "Fertilize your seedlings after they start to sprout.",
    "Some vegetables need more fertilizer than others.",
    "Others, like beans or peas, may not need fertilizer.",
    "If you need fertilizer, look for a 15-30-15 fertilizer.",
    "There are 2 ways to apply fertilizer to an outdoor garden:\nMix liquid fertilizer with water according to the instructions on the label.",
    "Spray or pour the fertilizer onto the plants.",
    "Liquid fertilizer needs to be applied more often, sometimes once every 1-2 weeks.",
    "Mix dry granules of fertilizer into the ground around the plant.",
    "This only needs to be done once or twice during the growing season.",
    "Add mulch to your garden to prevent weeds and help drainage.",
    "Spread mulch around the base of your seedlings after they are well-established.",
    "This means the seedling is growing larger and has sprouted many leaves.",
    "Buy mulch at a garden store or nursery.",
    "Alternatively, try using grass clippings, dead leaves, or corncobs.",
    "Caring for an Outdoor Garden Get rid of any pests eating your plants.",
    "Pests can be insects, like caterpillars or beetles, or large animals, like deer or raccoons.",
    "If you see bite marks, discolored patches, or other signs of pests, take steps to get rid of them.",
    "If you think bugs are blame, try to identify which bug it is.",
    "Common vegetable pests include the asparagus beetle, bean leaf beetle, and aphids.",
    "Buy an insecticide designed for the insect.",
    "To keep animals away, install fences around your vegetables.",
    "Plastic row covers can protect vegetables from both animals and insects.",
    "Remove any weeds that pop up in your garden.",
    "Look for weeds in your garden at least once a week.",
    "Ideally, however, if you see a weed, pull it or cut it out as soon as possible.",
    "Try to remove the roots if possible.",
    "Mulch can help prevent weeds from growing.",
    "Pick your vegetables when they are ripe.",
    "Look up how to identify when your vegetable is ripe.",
    "Some vegetables may be cut off.",
    "Others may be plucked or dug up.",
    "Make sure to do this before the first frost occurs.",
    "Watch your weather carefully to see when the first frost is predicted in your area and schedule your harvest before that day.",
    "While some vegetables can survive a frost, most will not."
