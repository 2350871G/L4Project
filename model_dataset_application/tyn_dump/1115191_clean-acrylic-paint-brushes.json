Don't submerge the brush for a long period of time; just swish the brush around to dislodge any more excess paint. If you used a cup of water to rinse brushes between colors, you can use this water or clean water. You will wash your brush with soap and water after this initial wash so it's ok if the water is cloudy. After you have wiped away the paint and submerged the brush, your brush will be cleaner. However, doing this much isn't enough to completely clean the brush. You need to use soap and water to clean the brush and keep the bristles soft and flexible."

It's important to work the soap into the place on the brush where the bristles meet the ring around the stem of the brush, which is called the ferrule.
