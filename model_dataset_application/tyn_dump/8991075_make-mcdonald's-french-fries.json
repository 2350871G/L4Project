The fry hopper is a machine that dispenses the appropriate amount of fries automatically when you place the basket underneath. It can be adjusted for small, medium, or large shots. If done manually all you have to do is grab a bag from the freezer and fill the basket with as much as you need. If busy nearly to the top, if slow you can get away with doing about half or less."
