Tear the paper into small scraps so it will be easier for water to soak into it. As a rule of thumb, the paper scraps should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long and wide. Rip the paper by hand for the best results. Cutting the paper with scissors is doable but won't work as well. The water will soak better into the paper if it has rough edges."

Continue this process until your blender has mashed the pulp into a smooth, fluid consistency. Depending on how much pulp you're making, you may want to blend it in batches.
