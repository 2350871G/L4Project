These allow you to pierce the exoskeleton, then grasp the scorpion and dispose of it. If this tool isn't available in your area, a pair of scissors with long blades, a long knife, or another long, sharp object will work."

          "description":"Scorpions aren't typically very fast, but act quickly to make sure you're able to kill the scorpion before it gets away. If necessary, pierce the scorpion again until you're sure it is no longer alive. You can also use a blunt object, like a heavy book, shoe, or sledgehammer, to crush the scorpion instead of piercing it. However, some scorpions have the ability to flatten themselves as thin as a coin, so just hitting the scorpion with your hard striking surface may not be enough to kill it. You'll need to twist your shoe, rock or other hard object will ensure that the scorpion is crushed and killed. When the scorpion has stopped moving or when its body is in several pieces, it is likely dead."

Get a black lightbulb from the hardware store and place it in a flashlight. Shine the light on walls, in corners, along baseboards, and in other areas where scorpions tend to spend time. Their exoskeletons will glow in the black light. Don't forget to check outside walls on your property, too. Scorpions can also be found in outdoor rock piles and other sources of shelter."

In some areas you can hire a professional to come to your house and hunt scorpions for you. Some pest control agencies might suggest using a pesticide application instead of killing the scorpions by hand. It might be worth a try, but many people have found pesticides to be ineffective in getting rid of scorpions."
