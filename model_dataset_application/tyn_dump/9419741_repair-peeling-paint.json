          "description":"Since moisture can get underneath the paint and cause peeling, look for leaking or temperature fluctuations that cause sweating. For example, if you have peeling paint in the bathroom, the extreme temperatures and humidity can cause peeling. Consider using a dehumidifier in that room. If the exterior paint is peeling, check around your gutters or roof to see if they're leaking onto the painted walls. If the walls near the kitchen or bathroom are peeling, you may need to see if the pipes are leaking."

          "description":"Because several things can cause peeling paint, your peeling walls may show damage differently. Look for peeling, cracking, or flaking areas of paint. You might even see areas that have extreme cracking that looks like alligator skin. These signs of damage can be caused by moisture getting under the paint or by painting on a surface that wasn't cleaned or primed well. Using cheap paint or painting second coats before letting the first coat dry can also cause damage."

          "description":"Once you've located the peeled paint, lay down old towels, a tarp, or a sheet of plastic underneath the space. If the peeled paint is on the main part of a wall, apply painter's tape to the trim. To protect yourself from ingesting old paint, put on a safety mask, glasses, and gloves. The old towel or tarp will catch the old paint and debris that you scrape off of the wall."

          "description":"Choose a flat blade to scrape against the wall with the peeling paint. The old paint should come right off and fall onto your towel, plastic sheet, or tarp. You can use a stiff-blade putty knife, wire brush, or paint scraper. Scrape until you don't see any peeling paint on the wall. Since removing peeling paint can expose toxic lead dust, pregnant women and children should avoid the area."

Spread a thin layer over the damaged surface so any cracks or holes are filled. Check the manufacturer's instructions to see how long the material needs to dry.

To repair a larger area, you can use a disc sander with a 60 to 120-grit disc. Sand the area until the surface feels smooth and blends in with the surrounding surface. If you don't want to buy a disc sander, you might be able to rent one from a hardware store."

Take a dry cloth and wipe it again so there's no moisture on the surface. The surface should be completely dry before you continue. If you've repaired a large exterior surface, you may need to hose it down with water. You'll need to wait 2 to 3 days before preparing the surface for painting."

          "description":"Dip a brush or roller into a high-quality paint primer. Spread a thin, even layer of the primer over your repaired surface and let it dry completely. This can take several hours or up to a day depending on the brand of primer. If you're applying primer to an exterior space, you can use a spray applicator to cover it. For a bathroom or kitchen, use an oil-based primer that can block stains. This type of primer will also protect humid surfaces from mildew."
