If you are cleaning an aluminum pot, place a few inches of water in the bottom, put the pot on the stove, and bring it to a boil for about five minutes. Then take the pot off the stove, wait for the water to cool slightly and use a flat-edge spatula to scrape off the buildup with the water still inside. If you are washing aluminum wheels or siding, soak a cloth in hot water and hold it against the buildup to loosen it, then use a flat spatula to scrape it off."

Bring the water and vinegar to a boil and let the boil roll for 15 minutes, then pour out the liquid. You may have to do this process a few times to eliminate all oxidation. If you are cleaning a small aluminum object, bring water and vinegar to a boil inside a pot, then take the pot off the heat and drop the aluminum object inside. Let it soak for 15 minutes, then take it out and rinse it off. If you are cleaning a large aluminum surface, soak a cloth in vinegar, then wipe it across the oxidation. Scrub with a soft-bristled brush, then wipe away the vinegar and lifted oxidation with a damp cloth. Don\u2019t use abrasive materials like steel wool or sandpaper to scrub the surface of the aluminum. While this can scrape away oxidation, it also will scratch the surface of the aluminum and make oxidation harder to remove in the future.
