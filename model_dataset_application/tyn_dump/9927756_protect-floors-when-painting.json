To use, simply unfold them and spread them across your carpet. You can reuse canvas drop cloths for many painting projects. While canvas is a relatively thick material, it cannot block out heavy spills. Because of this, be careful not to spill a lot of paint. Use a small amount of paint at a time, and be mindful of where your bucket or tray is at all times. Canvas drop cloths are hefty enough that you do not need to use tape. You can simply bunch them up along the walls to keep them in place. However, using masking tape ensures your drop cloth will stay put and protect your floors. You can purchase canvas drop cloths at most home supply stores in the painting aisle."

Plastic or canvas materials are often slippery on these floors, but rosin paper is easy to walk on. It often comes in a roll, so you can unroll it and tape sheets together to cover your floor. The size of your sheets will depend on the size of your floor, but generally speaking, you can cut it into about 5 ft (1.5 m) long sections so it is easy to work with.

They are not the best to use on most flooring options because they are very slippery to walk on, though if you want to use them, select as thick of plastic as you can. Plastic drop cloths work better to cover furniture when you are painting, rather than using as a drop cloth. However, they are a popular choice because they are easy to use, relatively inexpensive, and easy to throw away. Since plastic is not an absorbent material, spilled paint will not dry and can run across the drop cloth. If you step in the paint, you can easily track it across your floor."
