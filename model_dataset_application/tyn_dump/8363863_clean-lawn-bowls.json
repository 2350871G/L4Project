          "description":"Many lawn bowls have grips to help you hold the bowls more easily during gameplay. Dirt and grime can quickly build up in the grips, especially if your bowls have ring or groove grips. Before washing your bowl, chip any stubborn dirt out of the grips with a large wooden toothpick or skewer. Don\u2019t use a metal toothpick or skewer to clean the grips. This could scratch up your bowls."

Rub the bowls with your hands or a microfiber washcloth to dislodge any stubborn dirt. You can also use a steam cleaner, like those used to clean bowling balls, as an alternative to washing with soap and water."

You may wish to do a spot test first to make sure the mineral spirits don\u2019t damage the paint on your bowls.
