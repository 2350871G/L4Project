Alternatively, you can rip the newspaper into strips if you prefer. Make sure that the strips are roughly these dimensions, as the strips will be easiest to work with at this size. You can use an old comic or magazine instead of a newspaper if you prefer. You probably won\u2019t need a whole newspaper worth of strips, however, it is better to have too many than to run out while you are making your mask."

Pay special attention to their hairline, eyebrows, and upper lip, as this is where the papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9  is most likely to stick. Alternatively, use aloe vera gel instead of petroleum jelly. Make sure that your friend has their hair out of their face and tied back if necessary before you start applying the papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9."

As long as your friend can breathe comfortably through their nose, you can cover their mouth with papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 too if you prefer.
