Because of the way champagne is packaged, the carbon dioxide creates roughly 35 pounds of force pushing against the cork at all times. Glass is brittle. That means that it breaks instead of bending when it is damaged. Scoring the surface of the glass bottle will cause it to crack, and the force inside will cause the collar of the bottle and the cork to fly off."

In general, French and Spanish champagne tends to come in thicker bottles than American champagne. It may also be more expensive. Thicker glass works better than thin, but if you\u2019re operating on a budget, American champagne will also work. This trick typically takes half to a full a case to master. Plan on making at least a $30 investment to learn (6 x $5 bottles). Practice with inexpensive, corked sparkling wine. Note that some inexpensive bottles are cheaply made from inferior glass, which can lead to a higher rate of breakage and are therefore riskier to work with."
