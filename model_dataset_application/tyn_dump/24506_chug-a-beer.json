Waiting also gives the beer a chance to warm up a bit, which can help prevent brain freeze after you chug! The shape of the glass can affect how well you\u2019re able to chug your beer. A beer mug is much easier to chug than a snifter.Tip: Choose a lighter beer to chug. You won\u2019t taste the beer much anyway, but a light beer will settle in your stomach better than a full-bodied Guinness or a bitter stout."

An easy way to release some of that CO2 into the air rather than your stomach is to knock the bottom of the glass on a table or solid structure before you chug it.

Let gravity do the work for you. Be sure to hold your breath and don\u2019t stop the flow of beer to take a breath as this will slow you down and possibly cause you to spill precious drops of beer.
