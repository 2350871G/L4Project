Be sure to unplug the cord from the wall so you don\u2019t shock yourself later on. To be extra careful, turn off the dryer completely with the circuit breaker. If you have a gas dryer, turn the gas valve to shut off the gas line. Keep in mind that the wall sockets for dryers look different than traditional sockets. Make sure not to stretch out the gas line when you pull the appliance away from the wall."

Keep the leaf blower on for around 20-30 seconds, or until you\u2019ve confirmed that no more lint is blowing out of the vent. This rag keeps lint and dust from blowing back in your direction. Be sure to turn off the leaf blower before pulling it out of the vent. Since you probably won\u2019t be able to see it from the laundry room, have a friend or family member wait outside to confirm that the lint is blowing out."

Extend the vacuum hose as far down the vent tube as you can, or until you\u2019ve removed the worst of the surface lint. You probably won\u2019t be able to reach all of the vent duct with this attachment. However, if you have a shop vacuum, you can set it to reverse and blow the lint out."
