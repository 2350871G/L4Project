You can use any heavy type of decorative or scrapbooking paper. If it's heavy enough, you could even use brightly colored construction."

This will fit inside the other piece which will be the front and back of the card. You can use your fingers or a bone folder to completely smooth the fold."

The cuts should be in the center of the card so the pop-up image is centered. These tabs should work for images that are 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) in size. Take the size of your pop-up image into account. For example, if your pop up is large, you'll probably need a bigger tab."

Run your fingers along the fold of the card so that it's firmly creased. Crease the tab section in the opposite direction so it pops out and away from the card."

The second piece of paper will hide the tab so you can't see that the card is a pop-up until you open it."
