  "text":" Tinting with Food Coloring Place newspaper on the surface you are working on. Layer a couple sheets of newspaper on top of the table or surface you are working on. The newspaper will protect your work surface from Mod Podge and food coloring spills. Clean your jar. You must do this if you are re-using an old mason jar. Wipe the inside and outside of the jar with a cotton swab soaked in rubbing alcohol. Then wash the jar with soap and water. Use a clean, dry towel to dry the jar. If you are using new, unused mason jars, then just rinse the jars with water, and dry them with a clean towel. Mix together your Mod Podge and water. Pour 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of Mod Podge onto a paper plate. Then mix in 2 tablespoons (15 ml) of water. Using a plastic spoon (or a popsicle stick), mix the Mod Podge and water together until they are well-combined. Add 5 drops of food coloring to the mix. Use a color of your choice; it could be blue, red, green, purple or yellow. Use your spoon to mix the food coloring into the mixture. Mix until the food coloring is well-combined, or until all of the specks of color are completely gone. The color may look pastel at this point.

Painting with Acrylic Paint Protect your work surface. Do this by placing a couple sheets of newspaper on top of the table or surface you are working on. This will protect the surface from paint spills. Plus, it will make cleaning up afterward much easier. Wash the jar. If you are re-using an old mason jar, make sure to wipe it down with rubbing alcohol. Then clean it with warm water and soap. Dry the jar with a clean, dry towel. If you are using a new mason jar, then just rinse it with water and dry it with a clean towel. Prime the jar. Use a spray paint primer that can be used on glass to do this. Spray the outside surface of the jar until it is completely coated. Let the primer dry per the instructions on the spray can. If you want a chalky finish, then use chalkboard paint to prime your jar. Paint a base coat. Starting from top to bottom, use a foam brush to paint a base coat on the outside of the jar. The base coat layer does not have to be perfect. It can be streaky. Let the base coat dry for one hour. Make sure to use acrylic paint that can be used on glass surfaces. If your hand can fit inside the jar, then place your hand inside the jar while you paint the outside surface. This will make painting the jar much easier. Add a second and third layer of paint. Do this once the first layer is dry. Using the same method, paint the second layer onto the jar. Allow the second layer to dry for one hour. Then paint the final, third layer onto the jar, making sure the paint looks smooth (as opposed to streaky). Let the third layer dry for an hour as well. Sand the raised edges. Do this if you want to give your jar a vintage look. Using 80-grit sandpaper, sand the raised letters, symbols, and even the rim of the jar. Sand the raised edges until the paint is completely removed and the raised edges stand out. Seal the paint. Spray a thin layer of acrylic or clear coat matte sealer onto the jar. Let the sealer dry per the instructions on the can. The sealer will help prevent chipping. Spray Painting Layer a couple sheets of newspaper on top of your work surface. This will protect the surface from spray paint and primer stains. Make sure the whole surface is covered with newspaper. Wipe the jar with alcohol. Do this if you are re-using an old mason jar. Then wash it with soap and water. Dry the jar with a clean, dry towel. You only need to rinse and dry new jars with water and a clean towel. Add a layer of primer. Spray the entire surface of the jar with the primer until it is completely coated. Before purchasing your primer, check the back of the spray can to confirm that the primer is suitable for glass surfaces. Add a layer of spray paint. Before you begin spraying, shake the can. Hold the can three to four inches (76.2 to 101.6 mm) away from the jar. Press the nozzle and begin spraying the jar in a side-to-side motion. Spray the jar until the entire surface is covered with paint. Let the paint dry for ten minutes. For the best results, use a high-quality spray paint that can be used on glass surfaces.
