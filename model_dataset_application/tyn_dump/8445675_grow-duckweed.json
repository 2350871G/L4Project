Fill your container with some water from the pond. Then scoop some duckweed from the pond with your hand and place the duckweed into your container. Place the lid on the container to prevent splashing while you bring the duckweed home. Between 50-100 duckweed pods will be enough as they will grow and multiply quickly."

If you see duckweed in a pond, notice how the pond is almost completely without any shade and receiving plenty of sunlight. If you can't put duckweed near a window that receives 10 hours of sunlight, you can also use fluorescent light bulbs to help them grow.
