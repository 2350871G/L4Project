Honey Mustard Variations\nIf you like a little more heat, use spicy mustard instead of Dijon mustard. Or mix in a little bit of hot sauce. For a creamier sauce, increase the amount of mayonnaise you add. If you love Indian food, add a pinch of curry powder to the honey mustard. For a healthier honey mustard sauce, swap Greek yogurt for the mayonnaise. It will make the sauce a little tangier, but will also lower the fat content and increase the protein."
