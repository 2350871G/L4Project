Once the jar dries, you can flip it over and apply 2 coats of the same paint to the bottom. Work systematically from top-to-bottom. Make your coats light to reduce brushstrokes. You can always add a third one. Stick your hand inside the jar to turn it. This way, you won't get your fingers dirty or leave behind fingerprints in the paint."

You can tell if the paint is enamel-based either by looking at the label or at the drying instructions on the back. If the instructions say that the paint needs to cure for several days, it's enamel-based. If you are using regular acrylic craft paint, just let it dry overnight."

You can coat the entire inside of the jar, or you can leave bare patches. If you aren't getting the coverage you want, add another 1 to 2 squirts of paint.

Depending on how thick your coat of paint was, your design could end up looking somewhat translucent, which could lend your jar a delicate appearance. Print out a picture that you like, then tape it inside the jar. Paint your jar using the picture as a guide, then pull the picture out."

Apply 2 to 3 coats of acrylic paint, allowing each one to dry. Peel the stencil away, then fill in any chips using spare paint and a small paintbrush. If you wish to seal your jar, do so before you remove the stencil. Avoid painting over the stencil. This will reduce chipping when you go to take it off. Draw the shape by hand or use a cookie cutter to trace it."

For a twist, paint over the chalkboard jar with acrylic paint, let it dry, then buff the raised areas to reveal the black underneath."

Hold the spray can about 12 inches (30 cm) away from the jar, and apply a light coat. Let the paint dry, then apply a second coat if needed. Seal the jar afterwards with clear acrylic sealer in a finish you like: matte, satin, or glossy. In general, it will take 30 minutes for the paint to dry in warm weather, and 60 minutes in cool.

Stick your hand into the jar, then rotate it as you sprinkle extra-fine glitter onto the glue. Tap the excess glitter off, then allow the jar to dry upside down. Seal the glitter with glossy acrylic sealer, if desired. If you painted the jar by hand, you can wrap tape around it to get a neater line. Peel the tape off before the glue dries.

Use enough vase filler so that you can see it peeking through the bottom of your reverse stencil. If you used a regular stencil, fill the jar as much as you want. Glass marbles make great vase fillers, but you can use colored sand as well. You can find these in the floral section of an arts and crafts store."

    "Add a second color, if desired.",
    "You can repeat the process to add a second color to your jar.",
    "If you coated the entire jar the first time, the first coat will show through the jar and be visible on the outside, while the second coat will be visible only from the inside.",
    "If you coated the jar only partway, the second color will fill in the bare patches, giving you a two-tone effect.",
    "Use the jars as desired, but don't let the inside get wet.",
    "Do not fill these jars with water, otherwise the paint will come off.",
    "Use only dry flowers or silk flowers.",
    "Trying Different Techniques Draw designs onto the jar with hot glue before painting it.",
    "Clean the jar first, then draw designs onto it using hot glue.",
    "Allow the glue to set, then paint over the jar, preferably with spray paint.",
    "Allow the paint to dry, then distress and/or seal the jar, if desired.",
    "You can draw simple designs, such as dots, swirls, or hearts.",
    "You can also write words on the glass instead, such as \"Love\" or \"Witch Brew.\"",
    "If you don't have hot glue, you can try using puffy paint instead.",
    "The raised designs won't be as prominent and they will take longer to dry.",
    "Paint delicate designs by hand using a small paintbrush.",
    "Apply just a single coat of acrylic paint; if you apply more than that, the edges of your design may become blurred or uneven.",
    "Depending on how thick your coat of paint was, your design could end up looking somewhat translucent, which could lend your jar a delicate appearance.",
    "Print out a picture that you like, then tape it inside the jar.",
    "Paint your jar using the picture as a guide, then pull the picture out.",
    "Use adhesive stencils to paint specific designs.",
    "Clean your jar, then apply your desired adhesive stencil.",
    "Apply 2 to 3 coats of acrylic paint to the inside of the stencil with a pouncer (a round, foam brush).",
    "Peel the stencil away, then allow the paint to dry.",
    "Seal the jar as desired.",
    "If you are using a paintbrush, apply the paint from the outside edges of the stencil inward.",
    "Use cut adhesive vinyl to create reverse stencils.",
    "Clean your jar first, then cut a shape out of adhesive vinyl or contact paper.",
    "Smooth the shape onto the jar taking care to avoid any raised designs.",
    "Apply 2 to 3 coats of acrylic paint, allowing each one to dry.",
    "Peel the stencil away, then fill in any chips using spare paint and a small paintbrush.",
    "If you wish to seal your jar, do so before you remove the stencil.",
    "Avoid painting over the stencil.",
    "This will reduce chipping when you go to take it off.",
    "Draw the shape by hand or use a cookie cutter to trace it.",
    "Create a customizable jar with chalkboard paint.",
    "You can paint the entire jar with chalkboard paint, or apply it using a stencil/reverse stencil.",
    "Let the paint cure for several days.",
    "Prime the paint by rubbing chalk over it, then wiping if off.",
    "Draw a picture or write a message using chalk.",
    "For a twist, paint over the chalkboard jar with acrylic paint, let it dry, then buff the raised areas to reveal the black underneath.",
    "Spray paint the jar if you are in a hurry.",
    "Make sure that the jar is clean, then set it upside-down on a newspaper in a well-ventilated area.",
    "Hold the spray can about 12 inches (30 cm) away from the jar, and apply a light coat.",
    "Let the paint dry, then apply a second coat if needed.",
    "Seal the jar afterwards with clear acrylic sealer in a finish you like: matte, satin, or glossy.",
    "In general, it will take 30 minutes for the paint to dry in warm weather, and 60 minutes in cool.",
    "Handle spray painted jars with care.",
    "The paint may get chipped or scratched easily.",
    "Decorating the Finished Jar Paint designs onto the jar after the paint dries.",
    "For a unique look, use a thin paintbrush.",
    "If you want polka dots, use a round pouncer to stamp the paint on.",
    "Alternatively, you can tape a stencil over the jar, paint inside the stencil, then peel the stencil off.",
    "Use decoupage glue to add glitter to a painted jar.",
    "Paint your jar first, then let it dry.",
    "Use a 1 in (2.5 cm) wide paintbrush or foam brush to apply a layer of decoupage glue to the bottom quarter or third of your jar.",
    "Stick your hand into the jar, then rotate it as you sprinkle extra-fine glitter onto the glue.",
    "Tap the excess glitter off, then allow the jar to dry upside down.",
    "Seal the glitter with glossy acrylic sealer, if desired.",
    "If you painted the jar by hand, you can wrap tape around it to get a neater line.",
    "Peel the tape off before the glue dries.",
    "Do not use tape on jars that have been spray painted.",
    "This tends to remove the paint.",
    "Wrap a ribbon around the jar for a decorative touch.",
    "For something more rustic-looking, use raffia or jute cord.",
    "You can wrap the ribbon around the middle of the jar or around the neck.",
    "If you added a stencil or reverse stencil to your jar, then you would definitely want to wrap the ribbon/raffia/cord around the neck so that you don't cover the design up.",
    "Fill stenciled jars with vase filler if desired.",
    "This is great for reverse stencils, but it could look nice with regular ones too.",
    "Use enough vase filler so that you can see it peeking through the bottom of your reverse stencil.",
    "If you used a regular stencil, fill the jar as much as you want.",
    "Glass marbles make great vase fillers, but you can use colored sand as well.",
    "You can find these in the floral section of an arts and crafts store."
