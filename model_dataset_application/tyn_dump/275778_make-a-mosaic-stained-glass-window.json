Any sized piece of glass will work for this activity; however, a smaller piece will be a lot quicker to complete. Pick a piece of glass that doesn't have any scratches or marks, as these will distract from your mosaic. Consider using an old window pane from home. Alternatively, purchase a pane of glass from a hardware store. If you want to display your window as a stand-alone piece, consider choosing a window pane that has a wooden frame, as this makes it easier to move around."

Place your panes of glass onto a cutting board and then cut out your desired shapes with the glass cutter. Use the glass cutter in the same way that you would use a craft knife. Hold the glass firmly in position with 1 hand and use your other hand to press the blade of the knife along the glass to cut it. Purchase different coloured panes of glass from a craft store or from a hardware store. If you want a random mosaic, simply hit the glass with a hammer to break it into unique pieces. If you find it easier, draw your mosaic on a piece of paper and then use this as a guide to cut out each piece. You may choose to use a grinder to shape the glass if the pieces of glass don't fit exactly together."

If you have drawn your design, place this under the glass and then lay the piece on top. Alternatively, simply move the glass around to create a pattern, an image, or a random mosaic. If necessary, cut out extra pieces of glass to add to your mosaic. Fill the entire pane of glass with pieces of mosaic or simply place a few pieces of mosaic onto the glass to make an image or a pattern. A little blank space between each piece can look effective as it helps to create contrast between the pieces. Arrange the different coloured glass in a pattern or a colour scale. For example, use a series of different shades of purple to create a calming colour scale. Alternatively, opt for clashing colours, such as blue and red, to create a striking look."

Don't worry if the glue squishes around the sides of the glass, as the glue will turn clear when it dries. Choose a glue that dries clear, as this won't obstruct the view of the mosaic.
