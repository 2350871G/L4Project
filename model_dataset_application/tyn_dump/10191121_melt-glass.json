If the glass is too big for the microwave kiln, you will have to cut it into smaller pieces using a glass cutter. Only small pieces of glass can cope with the rapid temperature rise of a microwave kiln. The maximum size of the glass for melting in a microwave kiln is 1 x 1 \u00bd in (2.5 x 3.8 cm)."

In some microwave models, the rotator tray can vibrate or shift slightly while it's running. This will cause the glass to move and may disrupt the firing process. If this is the case, remove the rotator tray from the microwave and place the kiln in the centre of the microwave. A rotator tray is more effective however, as this will help to distribute the heat and to melt the glass evenly."

The black coating is a high temperature susceptor material which absorbs microwave energy. The composition of the black coating differs among kilns, but is usually a combination of graphites and iron oxides."

Generally the lower the wattage of the microwave, the longer the firing time will be. Refer to the instruction manual of your microwave kiln to determine the exact firing time that will be needed the melt the glass. For simply melting the glass, 3 to 4 minutes usually does the trick. However if you are fusing glass pieces together, it could take up to 12 minutes."

A good way to tell if the firing process is complete is to watch for a yellow glow at the top of the kiln. The glow will change from red, to orange, to yellow throughout the firing process, which indicates that the glass has melted.

A tack fuse (1350 - 1370\u00b0F / 732 - 743\u00b0C) is the lowest temperature fuse. The glass pieces will stick together, but will maintain many of their original features, such as edges and relief.

    "The firing profile is the sequential process of heating and cooling the glass across different rates and temperatures.",
    "This is what will determine how the pieces of glass in your project will fuse together, and what the finished product will look like.",
    "An example of a generic firing profile is - segment 1: Heat the kiln at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) per hour, up to 1100\u00b0F (600\u00b0C).",
    "Segment 2: Slow the heating rate to 200\u00b0F (111\u00b0C) per hour.",
    "Segment 3: Hold the temperature at 1240\u00b0F (670\u00b0C) for 30 minutes.",
    "Segment 4: Heat at the highest rate to 1480\u00b0F (804\u00b0C).",
    "Segment 5: Soak for 10 minutes.",
    "Segment 6: Cool the kiln down at the fastest rate to 950\u00b0F (510\u00b0C).",
    "Segment 7: Hold the temperature for 30 minutes.",
    "Segment 8: Cool the kiln down to room temperature at 200\u00b0F (111\u00b0C).",
    "The success of a firing profile can be dependent on the type of glass that you are using.",
    "Experiment using different types of profiles and glass until you get your desired result.",
    "There are many firing profiles available online, and it is likely that there will also be some in the manual of your kiln.",
    "You can adjust the firing profile to better suit your project if needed.",
    "Heat up the kiln to 1000\u00b0F (538\u00b0C).",
    "The initial heating segment of the firing profile differs between kilns.",
    "It can be done at different rates, and can take different amounts of time depending on the kiln, the firing profile, and your project.",
    "You can heat up the kiln from between 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) to 1000\u00b0F (538\u00b0C) per hour, depending on your firing schedule.",
    "Soak the glass for 10 minutes once it reaches 1000\u00b0F (538\u00b0C).",
    "Soaking means to hold the glass at a particular temperature for a certain amount of time.",
    "This is a generic outline for soaking, and may be slightly different according to your firing schedule.",
    "Heat the kiln to 1175\u00b0F (635\u00b0C) and hold for 10 minutes.",
    "This will help to relax the glass.",
    "The number of bubbles that form between the layers will also be reduced.",
    "This segment allows the glass to devitrify.",
    "Devitrifying makes the glass brittle, and white bubbles will form on the surface at this time.",
    "It\u2019s important to get the glass through this segment for fusing to be able to occur.",
    "Increase the kiln setting to high to reach the target temperature.",
    "This will fuse the glass at the fastest possible firing rate for your kiln.",
    "Reaching 1460\u00b0F (793\u00b0C) will fully fuse your project, but you can reduce this to 1350\u00b0F (732\u00b0C) if you are only wanting a tack fuse.",
    "Depending on the type and brand of kiln, this can either be done by pressing the \"full\" button, or by adjusting the temperature to 9999\u00b0F (5537\u00b0C) to help the kiln reach the target as fast as possible.",
    "Hold the kiln at the target temperature for 20 minutes.",
    "This will be when the glass has melted sufficiently and your project looks as desired.",
    "A slightly longer or short amount of time can significantly change how the glass looks, so keep a close eye on it.",
    "If you hold the kiln at the target temperature for too long, it may lose its set shape.",
    "You can remove the kiln peephole plug after 10 minutes in order to check the glass.",
    "Just make sure that you replace it once you have finished looking.",
    "Cool the kiln down to 950\u00b0F (510\u00b0C) and hold for 30 minutes.",
    "This lets the melted glass anneal, which is the process of slowly cooling down the glass so that the internal temperature is the same as the external temperature.",
    "This allows the glass to relieve the stress of rapid heating, and results in a successful project without breakage.",
    "The exact annealing point of the glass differs, so check with the manufacturer or where you bought the glass from to find out.",
    "Cool the kiln to room temperature.",
    "Keep the kiln closed, but turn it off and unplug it from the wall.",
    "The glass will slowly cool to room temperature, and the time this takes depends on the size of your project.",
    "Glass that is between two and three layers thick will generally take 6 - 8 hours to cool.",
    "Never remove the glass from the kiln until it has cooled to room temperature.",
    "Otherwise the glass could experience thermal shock and break."
