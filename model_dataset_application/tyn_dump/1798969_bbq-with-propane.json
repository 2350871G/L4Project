  "text":" Attaching the Propane Tank Get a propane tank for a gas grill. Propane tanks are measured by weight; if you plan on doing a lot of grilling, get a heavier tank with more gas inside. If you're only going to be using the tank a few times, opt for a smaller propane tank. You can find propane tanks at your local supermarket or hardware store. Place the propane tank next to the grill. Set it as close to the grill as possible so the grill hose will be able to reach it. Check to see if the propane tank is off. If the knob on the gas tank is turned to the on position, turn the knob to the off position. For most propane tanks, you'll need to turn the knob clockwise to turn the tank off. Remove the safety cap from the propane tank. The safety cap is the plastic cap covering the valve on the top of the tank. Grab the tab on the safety cap and pull to remove it. Attach the grill hose to the valve on the propane tank. The grill hose is the hose attached to the underside of the grill. Turn the propane tank so the valve is facing the grill, and connect the end of the grill hose to the valve; you should feel the end of the hose click into place. Once the end of the grill hose is attached to the valve, turn the knob on the end of the grill hose clockwise to tighten it into place. Continue turning until the knob won't turn anymore. Set the propane tank on the grill rack. The grill rack is what holds the propane tank underneath the grill. Check the manual for your grill for specific instructions on how to attach the tank to the rack. If the grill doesn't have a grill rack, leave the propane tank on the ground, next to the grill. Lighting the Grill Turn on the propane tank by using the knob on the top of the tank. For most propane tanks, you'll need to turn the knob counterclockwise until it won't turn anymore to turn the tank on. Check the arrows on the knob to make sure. Open the grill lid before lighting it. Don't ever light the grill with the lid closed or gas buildup could cause an explosion. Turn the ignition burner knob from \u201coff\u201d to \u201chigh.\u201d You may need to press the knob in before you can turn it. To locate the ignition burner knob on the grill, look for the knob with a lightning-bolt symbol or the word \u201cignition\u201d next to it. Don't worry if the grill doesn't ignite after you turn the knob; that just means the grill has an electric starter and you'll need to press the electric ignition button to ignite it. Press the electric ignition button if the grill has one. Look for the electric ignition button next to the ignition burner knob. Press and hold the button until you see flames ignite in the grill. It's normal for the button to make a clicking noise as you press it. Only the section of the grill directly behind the ignition burner knob and electric ignition button should be lit at this point. The rest of the grill knobs should still be turned off. Turn the other grill knobs to the highest setting to preheat the grill. Turning on the other grill knobs should cause the rest of the grill to ignite. Close the grill lid and let the grill preheat for 10-15 minutes. Always let the grill preheat before cooking on it so the food gets cooked all the way through. Cooking with Propane Use a wire brush to clean the grates on the grill. Brush back and forth over each grate, getting any dried food or grease to fall off the grate. Make sure the grill is preheated before you clean it with a brush; the heat will make it easier to clean. Turn the grill knobs down to a lower setting before you put the food on. This will prevent the food from burning. If you're only barbecuing a small amount of food, turn off the grill knobs for the sections of the grill you won't be using. If you'll be using the whole grill, alternate the grill knobs between medium and low heat so you have different temperatures to cook with. Place the food you want to grill directly on the grill grates. Position the food so it's over the flames. Place foods that need less heat, like vegetables, on the side of the grill that's set to a lower setting. Place foods that need higher heat, like hamburgers and steaks, on the side of the grill that's set to medium or high. Use a spatula or tongs to occasionally flip the food. Make sure each side of the food gets equal cook time so it gets cooked evenly through. Adjust the temperature as needed using the grill knobs. Remove the food when it's finished and turn off the grill knobs. Leave the lid of the grill open; the propane tank is still on and gas could build up if the lid is closed. Turn off the propane tank. To turn off most propane tanks, turn the knob on the top of the tank clockwise until it won't turn anymore. Look at the arrows on the knob to verify which direction you should be turning it in.",
