Trying Variations Bake a whole squash if you want to cut down on prep time. If you don't want to cut through the hard raw squash, bake it first so it's easier to cut the cooked squash. Poke holes all over the squash with a metal skewer and put the whole squash on a baking sheet. Roast it at 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) for 60 to 70 minutes. Then, carefully cut the soft squash in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. Wear oven mitts to turn the squash halfway through the cooking time. Although this method is easier to prep, the squash won't be as flavorful because the squash will steam instead of caramelize. Bake a whole squash in your slow cooker for 3 to 4 hours for a hands-off method. Hold the squash in place on your cutting board and carefully cut \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) slits across it. Put the whole squash in the slow cooker and place the lid on it. Then, cook the squash on \"High\" for 3 to 4 hours or \"Low\" for 6 to 8 hours. Once the squash is soft and cool enough to handle, slice it in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds.Variation: If you want to use an electric pressure cooker instead, put the steamer basket it the machine and pour in 1 cup (240 ml) of water. Place the squash in the basket and secure the lid. Then, pressure cook the squash on high for 20 minutes. Use the quick pressure release feature and cut the squash once it's cool enough to handle. Stuff the squash halves before you bake them. To make spaghetti squash into a complete meal, lay the squash halves on your roasting sheet cut-side up. Remove the seeds so you can fill them before roasting. Try stuffing the squash halves with:\nShredded chicken and saut\u00e9ed vegetables\nCreamed spinach with cheese\nCooked ground beef with black beans and corn\nSpaghetti sauce with cooked ground beef and parmesan Cut the squash into rings before baking it if you'd like long strands of squash.
