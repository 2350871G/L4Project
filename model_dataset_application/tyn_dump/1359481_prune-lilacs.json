Left on their stems, the flowers will die but continue sapping energy that could be spent on new growth. So don't feel guilty or wasteful when you go outside with your hand trimmers to take off the prettiest flowers - you're doing just the right thing for your lilac bush or tree. Another term for this type of pruning is deadheading. In addition to pruning flowers just past their peak, prune those that are already dying. Make the cut just at the base of the flowers. You can disinfect your tools before you prune to avoid spreading disease to your lilac bush. Simply wipe it down with a disinfectant spray or rubbing alcohol."

          "description":"Take a look at your lilac bush or tree and assess whether there are any extra-long but healthy-looking stems that need to be cut back. Doing so will help the lilac keep its pretty shape. The process of cutting back the stems a bit is called tipping off. Use a hand clipper to cut longer stems back to the next closest pair of side shoots. This means you'll be trimming the stem back beyond the flowered part, and all the way down to where side shoots are growing off. If A long stem doesn't have side shoots closer to the base, trim it back to the closest node or bud, where new shoots will sprout. Tipping encourages lilacs to sprout new healthy, bushy growth near the cut."

This process is called thinning, and it helps the plant by allowing fresh air to circulate through the plant and removing dying foliage that sap its energy."

Such pruning will encourage the development of new buds, which will continue maturing over the year before they bloom the following spring. However, if you prune too late in the summer, you risk cutting away some of this new growth - hence causing next spring's bloom to fall short. If you prune in the fall or winter, your lilac may not produce flowers at all."

This type of pruning goes beyond a lighter annual pruning to severely cut the bush or tree back, allowing for new growth to occur. Do your assessment in early spring, before the lilac has come back to life. This is the best time of year for a deeper pruning. Keep in mind that doing a rejuvenating pruning will mean losing the maturing buds that would otherwise turn into this spring's flowers.

Grafted plants need to be pruned with a bit more care, since cutting below the grafted area will disturb the graft and change the way your plant grows. Look for an area on one of the lilac's main trunks where there's a noticeable difference in bark near a lump. This is probably the graft.
