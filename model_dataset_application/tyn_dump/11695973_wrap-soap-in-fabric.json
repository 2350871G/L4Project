          "description":"You can eyeball the dimensions, but it\u2019s best to measure the soap first and cut fabric that is 4 times larger than the soap's dimensions to ensure full coverage. Simply measure the length and width of the soap with a ruler or tape measure. Multiply both measurements by 4 to get the correct dimensions for the fabric. For example, if your soap is 3 inches (7.6 cm) long and 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide, cut out a fabric scrap that is 12 inches (30 cm) long and 8 inches (20 cm) wide. Use lightweight, breathable fabrics, like cotton or burlap, to wrap your soap. Avoid heavy synthetic fabrics, like velvet, which can cause your soap to sweat, and delicate fabrics that stain, like silk."

  "text":" Tying Fabric around Bar Soap Protect homemade soap from germs and damage with shrink wrap. Wrap the soap in plastic shrink wrap material and use a heat gun to shrink the plastic around the bar of soap.
