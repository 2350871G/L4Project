    "Cut each brussels sprout in half lengthwise.",
    "Then hold each half and cut down the sprout, making \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) slices.",
    "Be sure to cut the stem end very thinly so that you don't have large chunks in your salad.Raw brussels sprouts make a wonderful base for a salad when they are cut into thin strips.",
    "You can cut your brussels sprouts with a knife or a mandolin.",
    "If you use a mandolin, then there is no need to cut the sprouts in half first.",
    "Massage 1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) of salt onto the shredded brussels sprouts.",
    "In order to season them and soften them up a bit for raw eating, sprinkle them with salt.",
    "Rub the salt into the surface of the sprouts with your fingers, breaking apart any pieces that are stuck together as you go.",
    "If you have about 1 pound (0.45 kg) of raw chopped or shaved brussels sprouts, 1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) of salt should be plenty to soften them and season them at the same time.",
    "Add additional toppings to your brussels sprouts.",
    "Once your brussels sprouts have been prepared, consider adding toppings that will enhance their flavor.",
    "For instance, grating a bit of Parmesan cheese or sprinkling a bit of cooked, crumbled bacon on top of them will help season them and bring out their flavor.",
    "You can add any toppings that you would normally put in a slaw or green salad.",
    "This includes carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, and green onions.",
    "If you are nervous about adding too much, add 1/4 cup, mix the salad, and then taste.",
    "If you add additional toppings gradually and keep tasting the salad, you can get the seasoning perfect.",
    "Put a dressing on the brussels sprouts after you prepare them.",
    "A classic way to season vegetables is to put a dressing on them before serving.",
    "You can use a wide variety of sauces, such as a honey vinegar glaze, a simple b\u00e9chamel, or garlic butter.Tip: When adding a dressing, remember that you have already salted the sprouts.",
    "Don't add one that is really salty to sprouts that are already salted.",
    "Using sauce for seasoning is especially good on raw brussels sprouts, as their firmness and bitterness can stand up well to a flavorful sauce.",
    "For instance, try a sauce that has cheese, nuts, or anchovies in it.",
    "Your brussels sprouts should store well in an air-tight container in the fridge for about a week."
