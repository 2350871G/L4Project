          "description":"If you're frying bacon and the grease catches on fire, it can be a tricky proposition. You can use the lid method, or use a slightly damp towel to smother the fire, but usually the safest and quickest (though not cleanest) method is to sprinkle a liberal amount of baking soda or salt onto the grease to quickly absorb it and eliminate the fire at the source. You should also feel free to use a fire extinguisher on grease fires. It works particularly well. Stand at a safe distance from the grease and activate the extinguisher. Avoid using water or flour on grease fires. Flour can ignite, making the fire worse, and--since water doesn't mix with oil--water can cause the oil to spray elsewhere, throwing flaming oil onto other nearby surfaces."
