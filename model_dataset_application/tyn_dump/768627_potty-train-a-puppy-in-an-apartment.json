          "description":"A young puppy (8 weeks) needs to be given the opportunity to go outside every 20 minutes, if you are to increase the chances of her peeing outside rather than inside. Older puppies also need to relieve themselves frequently, as they can't physically hold their bladder for more than an hour or two. To avoid accidents, scoop up your puppy and take her outside once an hour like clockwork. This way your puppy will learn to associate going outside with going to the bathroom. Once you get to know your puppy, you'll be able to watch for signs she needs to relieve herself. As soon as you see her displaying the signs, take her outside. When you're house training a puppy, it's very important that you be available to meet her needs at all times of the day. If you leave her alone in the apartment all day it might take a very long time for her to understand what she's supposed to do when she needs to go to the bathroom. If you can't be with her all day long, have a friend stay with her."

Pick a patch of grass close enough to your apartment entrance that your puppy won't have an accident on the way. Be sure to follow your city's ordinances regarding disposing of dog waste. Pick up after your puppy using a plastic bag. Dog urine isn't generally good for flowers, so try to find a public spot that isn't being tended by a careful gardener.

When your puppy relieves herself outside, giving her praise and a treat will make her want to do it again. Say \"good girl\" or \"good boy\" in a loving tone and give your puppy some cuddles. You can also give her a small treat each time she goes correctly. In order for positive reinforcement to work effectively as a training strategy, consistency is key. That means that every single time your puppy relieves herself outside, you should praise her. This is especially important in the first few months, when she's still learning correct behavior."
