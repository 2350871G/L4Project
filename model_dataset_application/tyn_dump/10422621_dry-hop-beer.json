Insert one end of an auto-siphon into the primary fermenter so that it sits just over the bottom of the container, then place the opposite end into the secondary fermenter and pump the siphon a couple times to get the flow started. After a few seconds, gravity will cause the beer to drain out of the higher fermenter and into the lower one. Squeeze the hose clamp on the auto-siphon to control how fast the liquid flows through the hose. Be sure to run some sanitizer solution through your auto-siphon before and after the transition to avoid contaminating or throwing off the flavor of the beer."

You can find a wealth of homebrew recipes using both single hop varieties and blends online through resources like Brewer's Friend and the American Homebrewer's Association.
