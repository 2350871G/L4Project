          "description":"If you don\u2019t have a polishing cloth available, use another type of soft, lint-free cloth. Rub the entire gemstone down as soon as you are able to. Doing it right away removes oil and before it has a chance to set in. You don\u2019t need to use any cleaners for it. Jewelers use a polishing cloth to remove tarnish. It contains a polishing compound, so it\u2019s more effective than any other cloth you may use. You can get polishing cloths, along with other polishing tools, online and at many jewelry counters."

          "description":"When your jewelry needs a little extra polishing, set aside a small bowl. Fill it with about \u20442 cup (120 mL) of warm water. Then, add about 2 or 3 drops of a mild dish soap. Stir the water until it\u2019s nice and soapy. Your regular dish soap will be fine as long as it isn\u2019t too harsh. Avoid any products designed to cut through grease. Fragrance-free soaps made for sensitive skin or cleaning baby bottles are always good options. Most types of jewelry can be cleaned with soap and water as well. Take advantage of the soapy water to wipe clean silver and gold settings, for instance, but don\u2019t use it on wood."

          "headline":"Scrub larimar with a soft-bristled toothbrush and soapy water once a week.",
          "description":"Dip the brush into the soapy water. Lightly scrub the larimar from the top-down, clearing off any debris along the way. When you reach the base of the stone, scrub around the edges and inside the setting. Use a soft-bristled brush only. If you don\u2019t have a good, clean brush to spare, try using a microfiber cloth instead. If you want to make absolutely sure you don\u2019t end up scratching the larimar, purchase a baby toothbrush. Set it aside in a clean place for whenever you need to polish your jewelry."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Soak the larimar in the soapy water if you are unable to get it clean.",
          "description":"For stubborn debris you can\u2019t get rid of any other way, submerge the entire stone in soapy water. Leave it there for about 5 minutes. Afterward, scrub it with a soft-bristled brush or cloth again. Stains will be much easier to remove. Metal jewelry can be cleaned this way, but don\u2019t soak anything that isn\u2019t waterproof, such as wood. Larimar has a tendency to turn a slightly darker shade of blue in water. If you\u2019re happy with the shade of your larimar, then continue to scrub it instead of soaking it."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Rinse larimar in clean water before drying it off.",
          "description":"Wash off the remaining soap and debris under cold, running water. If you don\u2019t want to soak the stone again, wipe it clean with a clean cloth dampened with a little bit of water. Once it\u2019s done, the stone should glimmer like it did on the day you bought it. Make sure your larimar is dry so the soap and water don\u2019t continue to soak into it. Any minerals or chemicals left could cause discolorations over time. After rinsing, you could apply a colorless oil, wax, or paraffin to fill in any scratches on the larimar. It usually isn\u2019t needed and is mostly done by people refining gemstones."

However, saltwater also tarnishes jewelry. For safety, always store larimar in a safe spot away from water. If your larimar happens to get wet, wash it off right away with soap and water. Larimar is generally safe in tap water, such as in the sink or shower. The water can cause the stone to darken a little, but it doesn\u2019t damage metal jewelry."

Leave it behind while cleaning or similar activities. Be careful with your jewelry even when you aren\u2019t doing anything intense. You could still knock it into a wall or table, for instance."

          "description":"Take the larimar off when you\u2019re sitting at the beach, for example. At home, keep it away from windows. Doing this will help the gemstone retain its sheen for much longer than usual. It also prevents any other parts, such as metal settings, from warping and discoloring. The sun isn\u2019t bad in small doses, but too much of it causes larimar to fade. Whenever you\u2019re going to be leaving larimar exposed for a long period of time, consider taking it off and folding it up in a soft cloth. Summer is the most damaging time for jewelry. On top of the heat and sunlight, you have to deal with sweat, suntan lotion, and various other things that could stain larimar. Be extra cautious and leave your jewelry at home when you don\u2019t need it."

Anything else you store with it could scratch it, ruining the finish. Harder gemstones, including diamonds, rubies, and sapphires, are some of the main culprits for unexpected scratches on larimar. Keep away metal items with sharp edges. Even if you wrap the larimar up, it could still come into contact with keys, utensils, and other potential sources of damage."
