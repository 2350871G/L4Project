    "Make sure you use oven mitts or gloves, or folded towels, to protect your hands from being burned when you remove the pan.",
    "Serve them now or wrap cooled muffins individually in plastic wrap and freeze.",
    "You can also top them with yogurt, cream cheese, butter, a drizzle of white chocolate or whipped cream!",
    "Thaw them at room temperature before eating if you decide to freeze them.",
    "Cake-Like Simple Muffins Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C.",
    "Prep the muffin pan.",
    "Either spray a regular-sized, 12-cup muffin pan with non-stick vegetable spray or put muffin or cupcake liners, which can also be sprayed, in each cup.",
    "Mix the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until it\u2019s light and fluffy.",
    "Beat them together in a large mixing bowl on a medium speed for several minutes.",
    "You shouldn\u2019t be able to see any sugar granules once done.",
    "Cake-like muffins use what\u2019s called the creaming method, in which you mix the butter and sugar before adding the egg(s), mix the remaining dry ingredients separately and then combine the two alternately with the milk.",
    "These recipes always call for more butter and sugar to act as tenderizers and minimize gluten development in the flour so muffins don\u2019t become tough.",
    "This, along with how the sugar creates small air holes in the butter when creamed, makes the muffins moist and light.",
    "Add the egg to the sugar and butter mixture.",
    "After you\u2019ve cracked the egg in a separate bowl and removed any stray pieces of eggshell, use an electric mixer on a medium speed to beat the egg into the butter and sugar mixture.",
    "Then set it aside.",
    "Stir together the remaining dry ingredients.",
    "Because you've already used the sugar, now mix the flour, baking soda and salt with a wooden spoon in a medium-sized bowl.",
    "Combine the milk with both wet and dry mixtures alternately.",
    "First add some of the dry mixture to the wet mixture and stir with a wooden spoon just until the dry ingredients are coated.",
    "Then add about half of the milk and stir until the batter becomes slightly moist.",
    "Repeat until everything is mixed and smooth.",
    "As with bread-like muffins, you don\u2019t want to over-mix, but you will have to use more than 10-15 strokes to combine the ingredients in this last stage of mixing.",
    "Spoon the batter into muffin cups.",
    "Use either a spoon or an ice cream scooper and immediately fill the cups 2/3 full so the leavening agent \u2013 the baking powder \u2013 still has enough \u201ckick\u201d to make the muffins rise.",
    "Don\u2019t fully fill the cups so the muffins have a nice domed shape.",
    "Bake the muffins for 20-25 minutes.",
    "Place the pan in the center rack of the oven for consistent and even heat distribution.",
    "Some muffin pans have a very dark pre-coating.",
    "If yours does, reduce the oven temperature by 25\u02daF as darker-colored pans absorb more heat, therefore becoming hotter and transmitting more heat to what\u2019s baking inside.",
    "Rotate the pan midway through baking to ensure they\u2019re baking evenly and to adjust the oven temperature if needed.",
    "Check to see if they\u2019re done after 25 minutes.",
    "Stick a toothpick in the center of a few muffins.",
    "The muffins are ready if nothing is sticking to the toothpick when you remove it.",
    "Put them back in and bake another five minutes if they're not quite done.",
    "Cake-like muffins should be golden brown with smooth tops.",
    "Remove the pan from the oven and let the muffins cool.",
    "Place the pan on a cooling rack for 10-15 minutes before gently removing each muffin with a butter knife and placing it on the cooling rack.",
    "Eat them while they're nice and warm or freeze for later!",
    "Simple Blueberry Muffins Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C.",
    "Get the muffin pan ready.",
    "You can either spray the cups of a 12-cup, regular-sized muffin or cupcake pan with non-stick vegetable oil, or you can put paper liners in each of the cups.",
    "If the muffin pan has more than 12 cups, fill those you won\u2019t use halfway with water.",
    "Choose cups in different spots so the muffins will bake evenly.",
    "You can also use foil liners; however, they tend to retain heat, so you may need to adjust your oven temperature or cooking time.",
    "Combine the dry ingredients.",
    "Use a wooden spoon to mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a medium-sized mixing bowl.",
    "Ensure you scoop flour into the measuring cup without packing it down before leveling if off with a knife.",
    "You can also use a sifter or strainer before measuring the flour if it has become packed down in the bag.",
    "Whisk together the sugar, butter, milk and eggs.",
    "In a separate, medium-sized mixing bowl, use a whisk, electric mixer or a fork to mix everything until it's well blended.",
    "You shouldn\u2019t be able to see any streaks of egg.",
    "Combine the wet and dry mixtures.",
    "Use the wooden spoon to mix the two, using only 10-15 strokes, so you don\u2019t over-mix and end up with tough muffins with tunnels from over-activating the flour\u2019s gluten.",
    "Fold the blueberries into the batter.",
    "Pour the blueberries into the center of the batter.",
    "Take a large, soft spatula and gently go along the side of the bowl to the bottom and bring the batter to the top, covering the blueberries.",
    "Do this 3-4 times so the blueberries don\u2019t crush and bleed into the batter.",
    "You can also dust the blueberries in flour before adding them to help prevent bleeding.",
    "Blueberries are just one of many things you can add to your muffins to change or add flavor.",
    "You can also easily make muffins with a variety of spices, fruits, nuts, oats, creams and glazes.",
    "Fill the muffin cups and sprinkle each with turbinado sugar.",
    "Using a spoon or ice cream scooper, fill each cup only 2/3 full with batter so they will have nicely domed tops.",
    "You can also wait until the last 10 minutes before sprinkling on the turbinado sugar.",
    "Put the pan in the center rack of the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes.",
    "Rotate the pan halfway through backing, particularly if one side seems to be getting done faster than another.",
    "Check them at 20 minutes.",
    "Insert a toothpick in the center of several muffins and, if it\u2019s clean when you remove it, they\u2019re done.",
    "Otherwise continue baking another 5 minutes.",
    "Take the pan out of the oven and put it on a cooling rack.",
    "Let the muffins cool for 5-10 minutes in the pan before using a butter knife to carefully remove them from the pan and transfer them to the cooling rack.",
    "Polish them off now while they're freshly baked or freeze them individually in plastic wrap for breakfast on-the-go!"
