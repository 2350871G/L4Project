Draw an outline of the room on paper, noting the length of each wall. Watch for gaps between the floor and the baseboard. They may be uneven around the room. The quarter rounds need to cover as much of each gap as possible, so take the gap size into account when choosing your quarter rounds."

          "description":"Quarter round molding comes in whole pieces from 6 to 12 ft (1.8 to 3.7 m) in length. Try to get single pieces that fit over your longest wall. That way, you won't need to create extra joints to cover a long wall. You can always cut down larger pieces to fit over shorter walls. The larger pieces of quarter round molding are often difficult to transport and maneuver. In addition, if your wall is longer than the molding available, you will need to join shorter pieces together. Doing this isn't too difficult, so don't worry about using shorter pieces if you need to. Quarter round molding is typically about \u20444 in (1.9 cm) wide. Thinner pieces stick out from the wall less. Keep in mind that thinner pieces are more delicate and won't cover larger gaps."

Also, wear a dust mask or respirator and work outdoors to eliminate dust. Use a good pair of goggles or a facemask to protect you from any shards that may break off of the quarter rounds. If you have to work indoors, open nearby doors and windows. Vacuum up any leftover dust when you're done. Avoid long-sleeved clothing and jewelry that can get caught in the saw blade."

Set the saw on a stable surface, then rotate the blade to the 45-degree mark on the left or right side of its base. Cutting the quarter rounds at opposite 45-degree angles makes them fit together like the corner of a picture frame. Using a miter saw or chop saw is the easiest way to cut joints in the quarter round. If you don't have a saw, visit nearby hardware stores or tool supply shops. Some places rent out miter saws. If you don't have a miter saw, try using a miter box to cut joints at a perfect angle. Another way to cut quarter round is with a coping saw or even a circular saw. Keep in mind these are a little tougher to use for cutting corners, since you need to carefully cut the wood at the proper angle by hand."

When you join the pieces together, you will get a square, 90-degree angle that leaves minimal gaps on the wall. If you're using a miter saw, doing this is easy. After making the first cut, turn the blade around to the 45-degree mark on the opposite side of the saw's base, then cut the second quarter round.

This can be a little tedious, but it ensures the quarter rounds fit neatly and properly. Plan on nailing shorter pieces of molding at their midpoint. As long as you keep the nails away from the joints, you likely won't have any problems installing these pieces. If you plan on installing the molding temporarily, use caulk. Simply spread a thin bead along the back of each molding, then set them in place. Glued molding is much easier to remove later on than nailed molding."

At the nail spots you marked, drill diagonally down at a 45-degree angle into the baseboard. Drilling holes in advance reduces the chances of the quarter rounds cracking during the installation. You will be able to feel the drill passing through the solid baseboard instead of the gap underneath it. Be careful not to go below the gap, or else you will end up drilling through the floor."

After placing a nail, tap the back end with a hammer until it is well-lodged in the baseboard. For a quicker way to attach the quarter rounds, use a nail gun with a compressor.

While pressing the trigger gently, spread a bead of caulk all the way around the edges of each piece of molding. Also, identify spaces between 2 pieces of molding, such as at the corners. Fill these spaces in with some caulk. If you plan on painting or staining the quarter rounds, choose a paintable acrylic-latex caulk. Some silicone versions are also designed to be paintable. Even if you didn't make the perfect cuts when joining pieces together, a little bit of caulk can make your quarter rounds look professional."

For unpainted wood quarter rounds, you can use wood putty instead of caulk to fill in gaps\nCaulk isn't dangerous to touch, but remember to wash your hands before touching your mouth or eyes."

Most paints take at least 4 hours to dry before you can improve the finish with a second layer. Acrylic-latex paints are usually the best choice for quarter rounds. Some oil-based paints also stand out well on floor molding. Most experts use semi-gloss paint, which makes quarter rounds bright and easy to clean. Glossy paints are available, but they often make quarter rounds stand out from the walls too much.

Wipe off the excess stain with a rag, then wait about 15 minutes before applying another coating. Continue doing this until the wood reaches the correct color. There are many different types of staining products available. Oil and water-based stainers are the most common. Oil-based stains are easier to use and penetrate deeper, but water-based products tend to stain more evenly. A lot of staining products take up to 24 hours to fully dry, so keep everyone away from the quarter rounds until then."

    "For unpainted wood quarter rounds, you can use wood putty instead of caulk to fill in gaps\nCaulk isn't dangerous to touch, but remember to wash your hands before touching your mouth or eyes.",
    "Touching up Quarter Rounds Spread a dab of wood putty to cover up nails.",
    "Wood putty comes in small containers or tubes.",
    "To apply it, all you have to do is pick up a small amount of putty with your finger, then press it onto the nail heads.",
    "Rub the putty to smooth it out and hide the nails.",
    "Choose a colored putty that matches the color of the quarter round, especially if you don't plan on painting or staining them afterwards.",
    "Use 180-grit sandpaper to smooth out caulk and filler.",
    "Apply light pressure when sanding the quarter rounds to avoid scratching them.",
    "Go over the treated areas to blend them into the quarter rounds.",
    "Touch them and look at them from a distance to make sure are well-blended.",
    "When you're done, wipe the quarter rounds with a damp rag to remove any debris.",
    "Sanding quarter rounds also roughs them up a little, preparing them to receive a new coat of paint or stain.",
    "If you plan on painting or staining, consider sanding all of the quarter rounds.",
    "Paint the quarter rounds with a semi-gloss paint.",
    "Match the paint color to the color of the baseboards behind the quarter rounds.",
    "Before opening the can of paint, protect the walls and floor by laying blue painter's tape around each quarter round.",
    "Then, brush paint over the quarter rounds until they look clean and well-coated.",
    "Most paints take at least 4 hours to dry before you can improve the finish with a second layer.",
    "Acrylic-latex paints are usually the best choice for quarter rounds.",
    "Some oil-based paints also stand out well on floor molding.",
    "Most experts use semi-gloss paint, which makes quarter rounds bright and easy to clean.",
    "Glossy paints are available, but they often make quarter rounds stand out from the walls too much.",
    "If you plan on painting over wood quarter rounds, make sure your paint is designed to adhere to wood trim.",
    "Apply a wood stain for a natural natural look.",
    "Match the color of the staining product to the floor and any wood trim in the room.",
    "To apply the stainer, spread it over the quarter rounds with a brush or rag.",
    "Wipe off the excess stain with a rag, then wait about 15 minutes before applying another coating.",
    "Continue doing this until the wood reaches the correct color.",
    "There are many different types of staining products available.",
    "Oil and water-based stainers are the most common.",
    "Oil-based stains are easier to use and penetrate deeper, but water-based products tend to stain more evenly.",
    "A lot of staining products take up to 24 hours to fully dry, so keep everyone away from the quarter rounds until then."
