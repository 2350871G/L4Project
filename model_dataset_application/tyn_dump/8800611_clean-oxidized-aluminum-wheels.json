Oxidized aluminum will wipe off black. If there is no black residue, your wheels are likely coated. Coated wheels should be cleaned similarly to bare aluminum, but only with a clear coat cleaner, like Griot\u2019s Garage Wheel Cleaner or Pinnacle Clear Coat Safe Wheel Cleaner."

Rinse all parts of the wheel and the wheel well thoroughly. Only clean oxidation from your wheels before washing your car. It\u2019s likely that while cleaning your wheels dirtiness will spread to your car. Dirt and brake dust have a tendency to build up around or between spokes, brake calipers, and even behind the wheel. Rinse these areas carefully. A Fireman\u2019s Nozzle can improve the stream of normal hoses, though power washers will be most effective at rinsing wheels."

Chad Zani\t\t\tAuto Detailing Expert\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Instead of going for the strongest polish you can find, start with a lighter polish.

As pitting diminishes, switch to a finer grit (higher rating) paper. When the pitting is all but gone, finish with your finest grit paper. Depending on the amount of pitting or oxidation on your rims, you may need to replace your sandpaper several times while sanding. Severe pitting may require coarser sandpaper, like one that is 320-grit. A power polisher will buff wheels more efficiently and quickly.

When the polish begins to dry or disappear, wipe the wheel surface with a clean microfiber towel. This process can also be done by hand. Buff polish onto wheels with a polishing pad. Polishing by hand may require considerable time and effort. Some polishes may have multiple stages, like those that have a general polish and a finishing polish.

    "Rinse the wheel regularly and keep it wet throughout this process.",
    "As pitting diminishes, switch to a finer grit (higher rating) paper.",
    "When the pitting is all but gone, finish with your finest grit paper.",
    "Depending on the amount of pitting or oxidation on your rims, you may need to replace your sandpaper several times while sanding.",
    "Severe pitting may require coarser sandpaper, like one that is 320-grit.",
    "A power polisher will buff wheels more efficiently and quickly.",
    "If you have a power polisher, save yourself time and effort by skipping this step and administering wheel polish instead.",
    "Administer aluminum wheel polish to the clean, dry wheel.",
    "Use an applicator, a soft, clean microfiber cloth, or a power polisher wool polishing pad to apply the polish to the wheel.",
    "Apply enough polisher for the entire wheel, or the amount directed in the instructions.",
    "Use a power polisher, if available.",
    "Activate the polisher on a slow setting and spread the polish across the wheel\u2019s surface.",
    "After the polish is well spread, little by little increase the polisher\u2019s speed until it reaches 3000 RPM.",
    "While polishing, keep the pad moving across the wheel.",
    "When the polish begins to dry or disappear, wipe the wheel surface with a clean microfiber towel.",
    "This process can also be done by hand.",
    "Buff polish onto wheels with a polishing pad.",
    "Polishing by hand may require considerable time and effort.",
    "Some polishes may have multiple stages, like those that have a general polish and a finishing polish.",
    "Apply secondary agents in the same fashion as normal polish, but use a clean pad.",
    "Wipe away remaining polisher with a clean microfiber cloth.",
    "At this stage, your wheel should be looking like new.",
    "If, however, you aren\u2019t yet happy with the condition of your wheel, repeat the polishing process.",
    "After each time polishing, wipe the wheel with a clean, soft microfiber cloth.",
    "For multi-stage polishes that use a fine or finishing polish, only re-polish the wheel with the finishing polish.",
    "If you plan on re-polishing, be sure to use new pads and cloths.",
    "Dirty or gritty polish can re transfer to your wheel or cause scratches.",
    "Clean and polish the remaining wheels in this fashion.",
    "Now that your wheel is cleaned and polished, repeat this process on your remaining wheels.",
    "To prevent further oxidation, apply a wheel wax to the wheel according to its label directions.",
    "Wheel wax can be bought at most auto and hardware stores, as well in the automotive section of many general retailers.",
    "An application of wax will prevent dirt and break dust from building up."
