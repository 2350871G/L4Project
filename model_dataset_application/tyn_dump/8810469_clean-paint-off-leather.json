You\u2019ll want to make sure that you\u2019ve dried the surface thoroughly once the paint is all gone. If you don\u2019t, the residual moisture can cause the leather to crack, split or blister. To dry leather safely and effectively, pat it with a microfiber towel or soft kitchen sponge. Consider treating the surface with a specialty conditioner. A good leather conditioner will enhance the color and texture of leather items while protecting them from spills and other accidents in the future."
