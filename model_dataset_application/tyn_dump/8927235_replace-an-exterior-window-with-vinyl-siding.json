Remove the exterior vinyl casing. This will be on the perimeter of the open space in the wall and will most likely be the same color and material as the actual siding itself. Use hammer to remove nails used to keep it in place. Use pry bar to pull it out carefully without scratching or breaking surrounding vinyl. Identify which pieces of vinyl siding need to be removed. You will be able to easily see the separate vinyl pieces by noticing where one piece overlaps the other on the side. Remove the pieces of vinyl siding from around the window area.

Installing the New Vinyl Siding Cut the new pieces of vinyl. If you look at the area you are working on, you will see spaces of different lengths where the vinyl needs to be replaced. Measure the lengths of the spaces with no vinyl. Cut the new vinyl pieces accordingly. A vinyl cutter works best for this task. \"Zip\" the newly cut vinyl pieces to the old vinyl pieces still on the side of the house. \"Zipping\" is the term used in siding when the top and bottom of two pieces are connected.
