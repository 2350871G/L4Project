Adding the Toppings Choose a variety of fruit, enough to fill 4 cups (800 grams). Ideally, you should have at least two to three different types of fruit.

Arrange the fruit on top of the pizza. You can arrange them randomly or artistically. For example, you could put the strawberries on the outside, followed by blueberries, kiwi, bananas, oranges, and pineapple. Finish off with more strawberries in the center.
