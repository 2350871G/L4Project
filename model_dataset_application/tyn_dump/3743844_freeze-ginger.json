  "text":" Whole Ginger Choose a fresh, unblemished piece of ginger (or more pieces, as required). Check that it is clean; if not, give it a gentle wipe and make sure it is dry before proceeding. Wrap the ginger piece or pieces in plastic kitchen wrap or foil. Wrap each piece separately if freezing more than one piece. Place the piece or pieces inside a resealable freezer bag. Try to match the bag size to the size or amount of ginger being frozen. Push down to expel as much air as possible before sealing tight. Place in the freezer. Remove a whole ginger for use at a time. Allow to thaw, then use as usual. If making a stir-fry and you have a decent sharp knife, slices can be made before the ginger thaws; it will thaw quickly during the cooking process. Minced Ginger Select a suitable piece of ginger. Peel and mince finely. Use a fine grater or a food processor to mince the ginger. Line a baking sheet or tray with parchment paper or foil. Alternatively, use an ice cube tray. Spread a teaspoon or tablespoon amount at a time of the minced ginger across a part of the parchment paper or foil. Keep the layer as even as possible. Repeat until all of the minced ginger has been used up. Place a sheet of plastic wrap gently over the top of the spread ginger. Place the sheet or tray inside the freezer. Let freeze. Remove from the freezer. Lift off the frozen portions of the minced ginger. Transfer each portion to either a resealable bag or an airtight container. If using a bag, try to expel as much air as possible before resealing. Place back in the freezer. Use as needed. This ginger will keep for up to six months. Medallion Ginger Select the ginger. Choose a reasonably large sized ginger to make it easy to form medallion shapes. Peel the ginger. Cut medallion shapes. Simply cut down along the line of the ginger to make \"rounds\" that look sort of like crooked medallions. Continue until all of the ginger piece or pieces are used up. Put the medallions into a resealable freezer bag. Try to pack it as tightly as possible. Press down to expel the air out of the bag. Alternatively, arrange in layers inside a small freezer-proof container. Place in the freezer. This ginger will keep for up to three months. Chopped Ginger Select suitable ginger. The ginger can be peeled or unpeeled, according to preference. If you want it peeled, peel now. Chop the ginger into small pieces. Thumb-size or matchstick-length pieces are suitable shapes. Place inside either a resealable bag or an airtight container for storage. If using a bag, try to fill as much as possible and press down to expel as much air as you can. Place in the freezer. Use within three months.",
