If you used pins earlier, remember to take them out once you are finished. Don't worry about hemming the bottom edge of the vest just yet. You'll do that after you add the zipper. Adding a Collar Measure the circumference of your collar. Fold the vest in half along the back so that the shoulders, armholes, and center-front opening all match up. Measure along the collar with a measuring tape, then double your measurement. This is how long your collar will be. Cut 2 rectangles for the collar, adding a 1-inch  (2.5-cm) seam allowance. The rectangles need to be the circumference of your collar, plus 2 inches (5.1 cm) for the seams. The height is up to you, but anything between 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) would be good. Remember to add 2 inches (5.1 cm) to the final height for the seams, however. Sew the top and side edges of the rectangles together. Pin the rectangles so that the right sides are facing in. Sew along 1 of the long edges and both of the narrow edges. Use a straight stitch and a 1-inch (2.5-cm) seam allowance. You can round the top corners instead if you want a softer look. Clip the corners, then turn the collar right-side-out. Cut the corners off, as close to the stitching as possible. If you rounded the corners, cut notches into them instead. Once you are done, turn the collar right-side-out. Sew around the collar seams to keep it flat. You can't really iron fleece, so you have to top stitch the collar instead. Start sewing at the bottom corner of the collar. Work your way around the first narrow edge, then the long top edge, then back down the second narrow edge. Use a 1/4-inch (0.64-cm) seam allowance. Backstitch when you start and finish sewing. Pin and sew the collar to the vest. Turn the vest so that the right side is facing you. Pin the collar to the top of the vest so that the raw edges match up. Sew around the collar of the vest using a 1-inch (2.5-cm) seam allowance and a matching thread color. Remember to backstitch! Finish the hem with topstitching, if desired. For a nicer touch, fold the hem against the body of the vest. Sew it down, \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) from the seam. Trim the excess hem below the stitch down to \u20444 inch (0.64 cm). Adding a Zipper Measure the front of your vest, excluding the bottom 1 inch (2.5 cm). Measure the front of your vest, starting at the collar and finishing 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom hem. Purchase a separating zipper that matches your measurement and open it up. If you cannot find the right length, buy a longer zipper. Pin a separating zipper face-down to the right side of the vest. The bottom of the zipper should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the vest. The side of the zipper tape should be \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) away from the edge of the fabric. If the zipper is too long and extends past the collar seam, fold the zipper tape towards the edge of the fabric. Sew the zipper using a straight stitch. Try to sew as close to the zipper teeth as you can. If your sewing machine has a zipper foot, now would be a good time to use it. Backstitch when you start and finish sewing to prevent unraveling.

Make sure that you extend the fold down to the bottom of the vest, and to the top of the collar. Topstitch the zipper using a straight stitch. Begin sewing at the top edge of the collar and finish sewing at the bottom edge of the hem. Try to sew as close to the edge of the zipper tape as possible. If your zipper was too long, you may have excess zipper sticking out from under the topstitching. Cut this excess zipper off. Fold the bottom hem up by 1 inch (2.5 cm) and sew it down.
