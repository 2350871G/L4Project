Find the switch indicating the doorbell unit on your home\u2019s circuit breaker and flip it to the \u201coff\u201d position. This will stop the flow of electricity and allow you to work safely. Attempting to remove or modify your doorbell without first making sure that the electricity is off could result in a nasty shock. If your circuit breaker isn't clearly labelled or you want to confirm that the power is off for safety's sake, press the doorbell button. If it rings, it means there's still current flowing to it."

Loosen the screws holding these wires in place and pull them free from the terminals. Pay close attention to the internal layout of the unit so you\u2019ll remember how it needs to be configured. It\u2019s a good idea to tag the wires or mark the terminals with the corresponding color to help you remember what goes where. If you don't want to go to all that trouble, simply take a snapshot with your phone. Typically, there will be 1 wire for the front doorbell and 1 for the transformer, with an additional wire if you have a separate doorbell for the back door. When the doorbell is pressed, a small current is directed from the button to the box unit, activating a series of chimes."
