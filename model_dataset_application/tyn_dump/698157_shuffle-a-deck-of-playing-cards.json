Place your thumb and middle finger on opposite sides of the long side of the deck. You can lightly place your index finger on the deck for additional support. Place the deck above the palm of your other hand. Use your free hand to lightly grasp the side of the deck with your thumb on one side, and the middle and ring fingers on the other. The index finger should stay out in front. Gently pull some cards off the top of the deck with your bottom hand. Use your bottom hand to grab several cards -- around ten or so -- and leave them in the palm of the hand. Move the deck away from the bottom hand. Move the deck just a deck's length away from the small stack of cards in the palm of the other hand. Repeat the shuffle until all of the cards are in your palm.

You can pick up the deck and repeat the entire shuffle a few times to shuffle your deck as well as you can. Riffle Shuffle Split the deck in half. Hold half of the deck lengthwise in your right hand, and hold the other half of the deck lengthwise in your left hand. Grip both halves of the deck. Each hand should follow the same position. To grip each half of the deck, place your thumb over the top edge and use your middle and ring fingers to support the bottom edge. Place your pinky finger on the back edge of the deck. Your index finger can go on the front edge or it can hover over the deck for support. Gently bend each half of the deck. Use your thumbs, index finger, and hands to bend each half of the deck a bit so it becomes concave, with the middle of each deck bending inwards. Riffle the deck with your thumbs. Bend the half-decks back a bit more and use your thumbs to move slowly up the edge of the cards. The cards in the two halves of the decks should riffle together, creating a shuffled deck. Do the cascade finish. Bend the cards towards you, in the opposite direction that they were bent before. Keep your thumbs on the top to keep the cards in line. Then, release your thumbs and the cards should \"cascade\" downward. Repeat the riffle shuffle (optional). If you'd like to shuffle the deck even more thoroughly, just repeat the entire process.",
