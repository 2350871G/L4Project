Most of the time, rice cookers will come with a measuring \"cup\" or scoop that can fit 3/4 cup (180 mL). Alternatively, use an ordinary measuring cup. One cup (240 mL) of uncooked rice will generate anywhere from 1 1/2 cups (360 mL) to three cups (720 mL) of cooked rice, depending on variety.

          "description":"Many people prefer to rinse rice in order to remove any pesticides, herbicides, or contaminants that may be present. Some less modern milling practices also create broken grains that release excess starch into the rice, which needs to be rinsed off to prevent the rice clumping together. If you decide to rinse the rice, pour drinking water into the bowl or hold it under the faucet. Stir as you add the water, until the rice is fully submerged. Drain water through a sieve or tip the bowl slowly while catching fallen rice grains with your hand. If the water looks discolored or filled with floating bits of broken rice or dirt, rinse a second or third time until new water added looks relatively clear. White rice sold in the United States is required by law to be enriched with powdered iron, niacin, thiamin, or folic acid; these vitamins and minerals are usually removed by washing. If your rice cooker has a non-stick bowl, wash the rice (prior to cooking) in a colander with several washes/rinses/drains. Replacement non-stick bowls are very expensive."

There are often graduated marks on the inside of a rice cooker, indicating how much rice and water should be added, or instructions on the package of rice. Alternatively, use the following suggested amounts depending on your variety of rice, but keep in mind you can always adjust these in future if you prefer your rice more chewy or soft:\nWhite, long grain - 1 3/4 cups of water per 1 cup of rice (420 mL water per 240 mL rice)\nWhite, medium grain - 1 1/2 cups of water per 1 cup of rice (360 mL water per 240 mL rice)\nWhite, short grain - 1 1/4 cups of water per 1 cup of rice (300 mL water per 240 mL rice)\nBrown, long grain - 2 1/4 cups of water per 1 cup of rice (520 mL water per 240 mL rice)\nSold as \"parboiled\" (not half-cooked at home) - 2 cups of water per 1 cup of rice\nFor Indian style rices like Basmati or Jasmine, less water is needed as a drier rice is desired, use no more than 1 1/2 cups of water per 1 cup of rice.
