When the ground is moist, the soil around the roots will be softer and more pliable. This will make it easier to remove the entire plant.

Angle the tool 15-30 degrees towards the plant\u2019s roots. Push the blade 4\u20138 inches (10\u201320 cm) into the ground using the heel of your shoe or by applying downward pressure with your hand.Tip: You can really use any tool with a sharp edge or point to get deep into the soil. A good knife will work if you don\u2019t have any gardening tools. Exercise caution and work carefully if you\u2019re using a bladed tool in your garden. The taller the plant is, the deeper the roots are. To compensate for taller plants, make the angle of your tool a little narrower."
