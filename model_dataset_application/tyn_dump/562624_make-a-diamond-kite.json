From the top point, measure 40 inches (100 cm) down on the edge of the bag and make a mark.

This will be used later. After you cut the kite out, unfold the diamond shape and lay it flat on the table. Building a Frame for a Trash Bag Kite Cut wooden dowels or bamboo sticks to 40 inches (100 cm). The dowels will be used as the frame of the kite.

You can also put some tape or glue over the string for added strength. Attach the frame to the plastic body of the kite. Make a small cut on each of the corners of the kite. Fold these flaps over the dowel pieces and tape them securely in place. Duct tape is best, but just make sure the tape holds the frame to the body securely. Once the corners are attached, you can place 2-4 pieces of tape along each dowel so the kite is secured across the whole body of the kite. Tie a 2 foot long strip of the plastic to the bottom of the kite. This is the tail of the kite, which will help stabilize it in the wind. You can also tie shorter strips onto the main tail for extra drag. To add more color, you could use bright strips of cloth instead. Attach the remaining kite string to the frame of the kite. Poke 4 small holes through the plastic around the center of the crossed dowels, one hole in each angle of the cross.
