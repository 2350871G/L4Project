If you're using a large grill pan that takes up more than 1 burner, place it across 2 burners that are the same size. This will ensure that the grill pan heats evenly. Cast-iron grill pans are good for stovetop grilling because they hold heat well and give your food classic grill marks. If you don't have a grill pan, you can use a regular pan or skillet, but your food won't have the grill marks."

Preheating the pan ensures that the entire surface of the pan is hot.Tip: To test if the grill pan is ready to use, dip your fingertips in water. Then flick the water onto the pan.
