Add \u00bc cup (60 mL) milk for a thick milkshake, or up to a full cup (240 mL) if you prefer a thinner drink. Whole milk makes a richer shake, while low fat or skim milk is a healthier option. For an extremely rich milkshake, also blend in 1\u20132 tablespoons (15\u201330 mL) heavy whipping cream. Crushed ice will dilute your milkshake's flavor. Use extra milk instead to thin the shake, and pop the milkshake in the freezer for a few minutes if it's too runny."

Use up to 4 tablespoons (60 mL) if using vanilla ice cream. Melt a few squares of chocolate or a handful of chocolate chips in a double boiler, or zap in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time, stirring in between zaps. If using this as your only chocolate ingredient, use approximately \u00bc cup (60 mL) of chocolate. 2 tablespoons (30 mL) cocoa powder will add flavor to an already-chocolatey shake, but may not be strong enough to use as the only chocolate ingredient."
