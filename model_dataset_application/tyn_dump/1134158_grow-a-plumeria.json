          "description":"Plumerias require temperatures of at least 65 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 18 to 27 degrees Celsius). They will not survive in temperatures below 55 degrees Fahrenheit (about 13 degrees Celsius). Any parts of the plant exposed to freezing temperatures will die. Therefore, it is important to choose the right location. If your climate regularly or seasonally gets colder than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (about 13 degrees Celsius), do not plant your plumeria in the ground outside. Instead, plant it in a container that you can keep inside when it gets cold. Even though plumerias have strict temperature requirements, they are flexible in that they can flourish outside or inside. Plumerias can survive in very hot temperatures, even over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 degrees Celsius)."

If planting plumerias in the ground, they will need to be planted 10 to 20 feet apart so that their roots have adequate space to grow. You can plant a root ball in a hole that is the same depth as the roots, but 2 to 3 times the width. Choose a planting location where the soil drains well and water doesn't puddle after a rainfall. Avoid locations where the plumeria will be exposed to heat radiating off a brick or concrete wall."

          "description":"Planting your plumeria in a container is useful so that you can move it inside if it gets cold. Or you can simply grow your plumeria inside year-round. If planting your plumeria in a container, be sure to use one with a hole or several holes in the bottom to provide soil and water drainage, as a plumeria won't do well with wet feet. Use at least a one gallon size container so that it has adequate room to grow. Black nursery containers are preferable to clay pots because of the porous nature of clay, which allows roots to be embedded in the walls and moisture to escape too quickly. You can find black nursery containers at your local gardening store. Plastic pots are another good option because they lack the porousness of clay."

Coarse soil will help ensure adequate drainage. Choose one with a slightly acidic pH as well, from around 6 to 6.7. To make sure your soil will drain properly, you can mix it with some perlite or sand. Soil can be found at your local gardening store. If you are planting your plumeria outside, make sure the soil drains well by mixing it with an organic material like manure or peat."

It can be a challenge to find them, so your best bet is to obtain them from someone who already has a plumeria. Perhaps a neighbor or relative already has a plumeria and would be willing to share these with you.

Pack soil firmly around the seeds or cuttings to hold them securely in place. If planting seeds, make sure the swollen end is at the bottom and that part of the seed wing sticks out of the soil. Only plant one seed or cutting per pot. You can plant them originally in a smaller pot (about 500 mL or 16.9 fluid ounces) and then transplant them into a larger pot (2.5 gal or 9.5 liters) after the seed begins to grow in about a week to a month. The smaller pots are known as cultivation pots and can be helpful for a plant that is just beginning to grow."

Simply make sure it has enough light and heat for about 3 weeks and then begin to gradually add water. Start by adding a half cup of water to the plant each week. Water any pre-started plants thoroughly; there is no need to wait. In about a month or two, the plant will begin to grow leaves. This means you can regularly water it each week. When leaves are about 5 inches long, it means the plumeria is rooted and you can water it thoroughly."

Stop watering your plumeria when its leaves begin to drop, and do not water it when it is dormant or first rooting. Overwatering a plumeria is a big hazard to the plant. To ensure that it isn\u2019t overwatered, allow its soil to fully dry in between waterings. When watering it, add enough water to moisten the soil, but it should never puddle on top.
