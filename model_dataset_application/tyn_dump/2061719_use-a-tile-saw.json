      "description":"Just as with any power tool, you want the tile saw to be securely positioned and level. A tile saw is best positioned on a heavy, bulky table or directly on the floor. Attempting to operate a tile saw on a wobbly table can result in inaccurate cuts and even injury."

      "headline":"Fill the tile saw's reservoir with water.",
      "description":"All tile saws will have a trough of water mounted beneath the cutting surface. In some cases this trough is removable, while in others you may have to fill it manually with a pitcher. Ensure that the water pump is completely submerged."

    {
      "headline":"Position the tile onto the cutting table.",
      "description":"Adjust the fence so that when the tile is pushed against it, the blade lines up with the pencil mark indicating the desired cut. It is best to leave the widest part of the tile between the fence and the blade; this will help you keep your hand as far from the blade as possible. For cutting tiles along the diagonal, position a miter guide or speed square between the tile and the fence. This will keep the tile positioned at a 45 degree angle to the blade. For making partial cuts, for instance when making an L-shaped cutout to accommodate an electrical outlet, set the tile up in the same way as a complete cut. You will simply feed the tile only far enough into the blade to achieve the desired cut depth."

      "headline":"Feed the tile into the blade.",
      "description":"Using a steady grip, feed the tile slowly straight into the blade. Do not force the tile into the blade any faster than it naturally wants to move; let the blade do the work of cutting the tile. Take care to feed the tile especially slowly at the edges of the tile, as this is where most breakages occur."
