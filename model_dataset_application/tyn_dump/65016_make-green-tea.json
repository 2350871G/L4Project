Avoid squeezing the tea bag because this will release bitter components into the tea. Making Loose Leaf Green Tea Heat water between 170 and 176 \u00b0F (77 and 80 \u00b0C). If you're using a stovetop or electric water kettle, bring the water to a boil and then turn off the heat. Let the water cool for about 5 minutes so the temperature is between 170 and 176 \u00b0F (77 and 80 \u00b0C). Always start with water that you haven't boiled before. This will help the leaves open as the tea steeps. Place 1 teaspoon (2 g) of loose-leaf green tea into a small teapot. You can use a small measuring spoon or a digital scale to measure the loose leaves for your tea. Put the leaves directly into the teapot or into the infuser basket if your teapot has one.Variation: For a much stronger cup of tea, use around 1 tablespoon (5 to 6 g) of loose leaf tea. If you have time, you can pour hot water into the teapot to warm it up. Then, pour out the water and place the tea leaves in the bottom. Pour \u20444 cup (180 ml) of the hot water over the leaves.

Keep in mind that each additional brew will need less steeping time since the leaves are already opened. Preparing Matcha Green Tea Place a fine mesh strainer over a matcha tea bowl. If you don't have a small matcha tea bowl (also called a matcha-chawan), you can use a teacup or a small kitchen prep bowl. Ensure that the bowl is heat proof. If you like, you can warm the tea bowl so it doesn't cool down your hot matcha tea. To warm the tea bowl, fill it with boiling hot water and leave it for 30 seconds before carefully dumping out the water. Sift 1 1/2 teaspoons (2 g) of matcha powder into the tea bowl. Measure the matcha powder into the fine mesh strainer. Then, use the back of a spoon to gently push the powder through the strainer so it falls into the tea bowl.
