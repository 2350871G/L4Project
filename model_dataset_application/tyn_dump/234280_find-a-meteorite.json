If the land is owned privately, you will need the owner\u2019s permission before searching it. Public lands follow different rules depending on the particular jurisdiction, but you always need permission to search any public lands. If it is privately owned land, you need to ask the landowner for permission to be on the property. If the land is publicly owned (e.g. a park) you need permission from the governing body to search it, and permission to keep the meteorite if you find it. Some areas classify them as artifacts, meaning that they belong to the municipality rather than the discoverer."

You can stick the end to rocks on the ground to test for magnetic properties. If a rock has magnetic properties, then there\u2019s a chance that it could be a meteorite and warrants further investigation. Using a long stick will prevent you from continually bending over to see if individual rocks are magnetic."

Go to the location that you intend to search and run the coil of the metal detector along the ground to scan for meteorites underneath the surface. Good, used metal detectors generally cost between $250 and $400. There is no need to buy a new one for a higher price. The metal detector is more sensitive than a meteorite stick, but less convenient to use. You should keep both with you."

Second, it allows you to mark the location of any meteorites that you find. If you do find a meteorite, marking its location is important. This allows you to upload it to the meteorite databases and help map the location of meteorites."
