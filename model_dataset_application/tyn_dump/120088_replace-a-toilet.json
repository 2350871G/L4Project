  "text":" Removing the Old Toilet Get rid of all the water. Turn off the water at the supply valve. Flush the toilet to remove most of the water (holding down the flusher for as long as possible). Remove the remaining water from the bowl by forcing it down with a plunger and mopping up the remaining water with a sponge. Then, remove the remaining water in the tank with the sponge as well. Disconnect the line. Disconnect the supply line using a wrench. You may want to take the opportunity to replace the line. If keeping the line, only disconnect it where it attaches to the toilet. Remove the bolts. Take the caps (they look a little like domes) off of the bolts at the base of the toilet, then remove those bolts. After that, remove the bolts connecting the tank to the seat. Remove the tank. Straddling the bowl, place a hand on either side of the base of the tank and lift it off, rocking it side-to-side a little to ease it off and making sure to bend with your knees. Put it somewhere out of the way but be sure to put it somewhere water resistant, as there may be residual water. Remove the seat. Now you can remove the rest of the toilet. Grab the toilet and rock it side-to-side to break the wax seal underneath and lift it off the bolts. If the bolts are badly rusted and the toilet is getting caught, you may need to cut off as much of the bolts as you can see using a hacksaw. Remove the toilet and put it somewhere out of the way. Preparing Your New Toilet Plug the hole. Using an old rag balled up, plug the hole, as you will want to prevent gases from rising into your home and keep tools from disappearing into the floor! Just remember to remove this rag when you put the new toilet in place. Remove the old bolts. Pull the old bolts out of the flange (you will probably need to pull them to the side a little, as are placed like a nail hanging a picture frame). Dispose of the old bolts in an appropriate manner. Remove the wax seal. Remove everything that remains of the old wax seal. You can use a putty knife, a rag, and any other tools you need. Wipe it clean when you are done. Inspect the flange. This is the round plastic or metal circle which was under the wax. Inspect the flange: if it looks damaged it may need to be replaced. You can also buy an adaptor (or super flange) if the original is a bit cracked or damaged. Replace the bolts. With the flange in good shape, you can now place new bolts into the flange.

There should be appropriate instructions on the packaging when you purchase the assembly, but you can also ask your local hardware store employee for advice. Install the toilet seat lid and ring.
