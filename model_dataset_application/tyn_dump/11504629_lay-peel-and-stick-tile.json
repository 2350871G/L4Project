    "Continue rolling across all of your tiles so they\u2019re less likely to lift up as they age.",
    "Ask hardware or flooring specialty stores if they can rent you a vinyl roller so you don\u2019t have to buy one.Tip: If you aren\u2019t able to get a vinyl roller, you can also use a standard rolling pin.",
    "Apply firm pressure as you roll over each of your tiles.",
    "Apply grout if you\u2019re using groutable peel and stick tiles.",
    "Grout helps fill in spaces between tiles and prevents dirt from getting stuck on your floors.",
    "Mix the grout in its container so you can spread it around easily, and transfer some onto your floor with a grout sponge.",
    "Press the grout into the spaces between your tiles with the sponge until it\u2019s flush with the tops of the tiles.",
    "Leave the grout to dry for at least 24 hours so it has time to set.",
    "Don\u2019t apply grout if you didn\u2019t use groutable peel and stick tiles since they will be too thin otherwise.",
    "Be sure to wipe any excess grout away with clean water so your tiles don\u2019t try with a hazy finish.",
    "Wait 5 days before cleaning or washing your floor.",
    "Your new tiles will take some time to fully set and waterproof your floors, so avoid doing any heavy cleaning.",
    "Don\u2019t use a mop or water on the floor since moisture could still get caught underneath the tiles.",
    "After 5 days, you can clean as you normally would.",
    "It\u2019s okay to sweep or vacuum if you need to.",
    "Try to avoid using the room with new tiles as much as you can so you don\u2019t feel the need to clean it.",
    "Reinstall the baseboards in your room.",
    "Line up the old baseboards with their positions on the walls and press them in firmly.",
    "Use a hammer to pound the nails back into your wall to secure the boards in place.",
    "Continue working around the perimeter of your room to reinstall the boards so they hide the edges of your tiles.",
    "Get new baseboards if you accidentally broke the old ones."
