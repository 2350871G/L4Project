Using Boiling Water and Soap Place your item in a pot of boiling water on your stove. Choose a pot that is big enough to hold your entire bronze item. Bring the water to a boil first, and then place your bronze inside the pot. Leave it in the pot for a moment or two, until it is hot. If your item is too large to fit in a pot of boiling water, consider using a different method to clean it. Remove the item from the pot carefully.

Using Household Items Cover your item with ketchup. Using a sponge, your hand (in a glove, if you want to avoid a mess), or simply a bowl full of ketchup, apply ketchup to the entire surface of your bronze. Let it stay covered in ketchup for about 15 minutes. Rinse it with warm water, and then dry it with a soft cloth. Apply lemon juice to your bronze item. You can squirt lemon juice onto it, or soak the item in lemon juice for 15-20 minutes. Remove the item, rinse it with warm water, and then dry it thoroughly with a soft cloth.
