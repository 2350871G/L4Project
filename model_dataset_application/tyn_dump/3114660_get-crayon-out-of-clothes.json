          "description":"If you're trying to remove a small stain, put an ice cube into a small sealable bag. Place the ice cube in the bag directly onto the crayon stain and hold it there until the crayon wax feels hard. This should take about 5 minutes for a small stain.Tip: It's important to work with hardened wax. If you begin scraping soft crayon wax, you'll work the wax deeper into the clothing fibers and smear the stain. If there are several stains, put the clothing into a bag and place the bag in the freezer. Chill the fabric until the wax stains harden."

Hold the fabric in place with 1 hand and use a knife to carefully scrape the wax off of the fabric. Scrape as much of the wax off as you can. If the wax starts to soften before you scrape it off, put the clothes back in the freezer for a few minutes so the wax can harden again. Scrape the knife away from your body to prevent cutting yourself."
