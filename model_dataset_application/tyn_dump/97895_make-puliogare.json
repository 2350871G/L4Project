Set the bowl to the side for at least 1 hour so that the tamarind paste has a chance to soften. Tamarind paste has been separated out from the actual pod and has been deseeded, so you don\u2019t need to worry about straining it after it has soaked. You can buy tamarind paste from many Indian groceries, though Asian and Chinese groceries also usually carry it. If your local stores don\u2019t have it, try ordering it online."

Heat the spices in a pan on the stovetop over high heat for about 5 minutes. Stir the spices constantly so they don\u2019t burn, and stop once they are aromatic and the chana dal and chilis have turned a light-gold color. Chana dal is made from chickpeas and has the look and taste of small corn kernels.

    "This takes about 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "Don\u2019t lift up the lid to check the water.",
    "This will mess up the cooking process.",
    "Turn the heat to low and cook the rice for 5 minutes.",
    "Listen to the pot during this time.",
    "Once you hear a hissing noise, turn the heat up to high for 30 seconds to give the rice a quick burst of heat to help dry it out even more.",
    "If you need to, quickly lift the lid to check the rice and ensure the water is gone.",
    "Turn off the burner and let the rice settle for 10 minutes.",
    "Keep the lid on the rice during this time.",
    "Try to not leave the rice for longer than 15 minutes, or the rice might start to harden.",
    "Once the 10 minutes have passed, take off the lid and fluff the rice with a fork.",
    "This time allows the rice to absorb any residual water that might be left at the bottom of the pan.",
    "If you try to eat it right away, the rice might not have fully cooked yet.",
    "Drizzle the cooked rice with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of sesame oil.",
    "After you\u2019ve fluffed the rice, take your sesame oil and drizzle it over the top of it.",
    "This helps the flavor of the rice incorporate well with the flavor of the pulikachal once you mix it in with the rice.",
    "You can add more or less sesame oil, just depending on your preference.",
    "Let the rice cool completely before adding the pulikachal.",
    "Puliogare is served cold, so wait until the rice has cooled down before mixing it with the spicy pulikachal and eating it.",
    "You can even move the rice right to the fridge and store it for a few days until you want to eat it.",
    "Puliogare is great to make ahead of time since it\u2019s served cold, and it makes a great dish to bring along somewhere, especially if you\u2019ll be traveling a long distance.",
    "Serving the Puliogare Mix 1 cup (200 grams) of rice with 3 tablespoons of pulikachal.",
    "Use cooled rice and either warm or cooled pulikachal.",
    "Mix these together gently, so that the rice doesn\u2019t get mashed up.",
    "1 cup (200 grams) of puliogare is generally enough for 2 people, especially if you are serving it alongside other dishes.",
    "Set the mixed rice to the side for about 20 minutes.",
    "You can leave the rice for as long as an hour.",
    "Letting the rice and pulikachal sit together for a while lets the rice absorb more of the flavor.",
    "You don\u2019t have to wait to eat the puliogare, but a little patience does help make the dish more flavorful!",
    "Drizzle sesame oil on the puliogare if it\u2019s too spicy.",
    "Once you\u2019ve started to eat, if you find the puliogare is spicier than you\u2019d like, mix in a few drops of sesame oil.",
    "1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) or less of sesame oil should be sufficient to help bring down the intensity of the spice.",
    "You can also pair the puliogare with a yogurt, which would have a cooling effect.",
    "Serve the puliogare with mild-flavored dishes.",
    "Because the puliogare itself is so spicy, pair it with yogurt-based dishes or curd-based ones.",
    "It also goes well with foods like chickpeas and potatoes.",
    "Avoid pairing the puliogare with dishes that have extremely strong flavors.",
    "Save any leftovers in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.",
    "Because the pulikachal itself stays good for a long time, the actual mixed puliogare itself does, too.",
    "It\u2019s a great dish to make ahead of time or at the beginning of the week to use for lunches.",
    "Keep the leftovers in an airtight container.",
    "Label the container with the \u201cmade on\u201d date so you can keep in mind how long they\u2019ve been in your fridge.",
    "If the rice gets too dried out or if the mix starts to smell strange, it\u2019s time to get rid of it."
