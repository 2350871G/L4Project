      "description":"The type of foundation depends on the area of the foundation will be located on and the type of structure that will be placed on it. Shallow foundations are built on level ground and hard surfaces. Shallow foundations are no more than 3 feet (0.91 m) (91.44 cm) deep and are used primarily for smaller, simpler projects like holding patio furniture, a fountain, or an air conditioning unit. Deep foundations are used for more complex projects. Deep foundations are also used when soil conditions are poor or when building a structure on a hill. Deep foundations are more than 3 feet (0.91 m) (91.44 cm) deep and can have varying depths throughout. This type of foundation is suited for a shed or a detached garage."

Rain can cause depressions in the concrete and cause your foundation to be uneven."
