Add 8 inches (20 cm) to the height and 6 inches (15 cm) to the width measurement you took so the well can fit around the outside of the window. For example if you have a window that's 12 by 30 inches (30 cm \u00d7 76 cm), then you need a well that's at least 20 inches (51 cm) tall and 36 inches (91 cm) wide."

Continue digging around the window until the hole is about 4\u20135 inches (10\u201313 cm) deeper than the bottom of the window sill and 6 inches (15 cm) wider than the well.

Turn the auger on and push it slowly into the ground so it bores down about 1 foot (30 cm). Pull the auger out from the ground to clean off any dirt on the blades.

Measure the depth of the drain hole and get a tube that's the same length. Place the tube in the center of the drain hole and drain cap on top so dirt and gravel can't get inside and clog it. You can buy drain caps from your local hardware store. If you can't find a pipe with perforation, then cut 2 in (5.1 cm) long slits on each side every 1 ft (30 cm) along the pipe's length.

After you draw all of the marks, take the window well out of the hole. If your window well doesn't already have holes drilled in the sides, then you may need to make your own holes.

Continue drilling holes at each of your marks along the foundation wall. Put on a pair of safety glasses so you don't get hurt while drilling the holes.
