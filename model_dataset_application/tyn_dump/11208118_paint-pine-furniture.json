          "description":"You\u2019re going to make a little bit of a mess while sanding your wood and you don\u2019t want any paint dripping on to your floor, so set out a large drop cloth underneath your furniture. If you\u2019re painting a smaller item, feel free to take it outside so that you don\u2019t need to worry about making a mess in your home. If you paint your furniture outside on a windy day, you could end up with a lot of small pieces of dust, grass, or debris getting stuck in your paint. A windy day is excellent for sanding though."

Run the rag or cloth over every surface of your furniture to remove any dirt, debris, or splinters. Let the furniture air dry for at least 30-45 minutes. If your pine is unfinished, wait 2-3 hours to give the moisture time to evaporate.

          "description":"Purchase a sanding brick or attach a sheet of 120-150 grit sandpaper to a belt sander. Run your sandpaper firmly across every surface of your furniture to pull up the porous wood, remove debris and splinters, and make it easier to paint. If you\u2019re using a belt sander, guide it carefully over the furniture. If you\u2019re using a sanding brick, use light back-and-forth strokes. Work in the direction of the grain.Tip: If you\u2019re painting finished furniture, don\u2019t worry about removing the paint. The goal is to soften the wood and expose the pores, not remove paint. Unless you want a spongy, distressed look, you need to sand your furniture regardless of whether it is finished or unfinished. Stop after you\u2019ve run the sandpaper over every section of the wood. Wear protective eyewear and gloves while doing this to prevent damaging your eyes or hands. Put on a dust mask before sanding to keep your lungs safe."

          "headline":"Sand again using 200-220 grit sandpaper.",
          "description":"Use the same method that you used to sand your furniture the first time to ensure that your wood grain remains uniform. Sand your furniture lightly with your brick or sander to remove smaller blemishes and smooth out minor scratches. Sanding twice will make it easier for the primer to bind with the wood, which will make the paint more uniform and permanent when you apply it. The finer sandpaper will also remove any wood dust that is sticking to your furniture after using the rougher sandpaper. You can stop sanding after you\u2019ve run the sandpaper over each section of the furniture. Sanding with the finer paper will remove hard-to-see splinters and minor imperfections."

It is easier to paint these removable pieces separately, and removing them will prevent you from missing hard-to-reach areas between gaps. You don\u2019t need to prime, sand, or paint the areas that aren\u2019t going to be visible.

If you\u2019re going to use an alkyd or oil-based paint, use a primer that uses the same base as the paint. Read a label before purchasing a primer to make sure that it is stain-blocking for the best results.Warning: Pine is a tannin-rich wood, which means that it can resist paint fairly well. Because pine is so strong, you absolutely cannot skip the priming process. Your paint job will not be uniform or clean if you don\u2019t prime your wood. Wear a respirator or dust mask if you\u2019re working with oil-based primer. The fumes are a lung irritant. Open a window before pouring your primer if you\u2019re working indoors. Even nontoxic latex primers can smell obnoxious in a closed room."

          "headline":"Roll larger surface areas with a thin-napped mini-roller.",
          "description":"Use a 6 in (15 cm) foam roller to cover larger surfaces of your furniture. Submerge your roller in the paint and then roll it 2-3 times in the tray to remove excess paint. Use light pressure to roll up and down across the flat surfaces. Roll 2-3 times over an area to ensure that you get primer on every section of your furniture. A medium-sized dresser should require roughly 0.5 gallons (1.9 L) of paint. It can be really hard to remove oil-based primer from a roller. You may be better off not wasting your time trying to clean it and toss it out. You can also wrap it in a plastic bag to keep it wet if you want to apply multiple layers. For rougher pine, use a thick-napped roller instead. You can use a larger roller if your furniture is larger."

It\u2019s okay if the coat of primer isn\u2019t perfectly even in color\u2014especially if you\u2019re using a gloss paint\u2014but every surface should be primed. Use your brush to work around any handles or edges of painter\u2019s tape. Avoid drips by brushing with light pressure and allowing your brush to move in your wrist as you paint."

If you\u2019re painting a furniture item that you touch frequently, like a dresser or table, choose an alkyd-based paint. Latex paint will rub off more easily over time, especially if the furniture is being used regularly. For decorative pieces, latex will hold up just fine. If you\u2019re painting kitchen or bathroom cabinets, use an oil-based paint. It will resist moisture more efficiently than an alkyd or latex paint.

    "If you plan on using latex paint, use a latex primer.",
    "If you\u2019re going to use an alkyd or oil-based paint, use a primer that uses the same base as the paint.",
    "Read a label before purchasing a primer to make sure that it is stain-blocking for the best results.Warning: Pine is a tannin-rich wood, which means that it can resist paint fairly well.",
    "Because pine is so strong, you absolutely cannot skip the priming process.",
    "Your paint job will not be uniform or clean if you don\u2019t prime your wood.",
    "Wear a respirator or dust mask if you\u2019re working with oil-based primer.",
    "The fumes are a lung irritant.",
    "Open a window before pouring your primer if you\u2019re working indoors.",

    "Roll 2-3 times over an area to ensure that you get primer on every section of your furniture.",
    "A medium-sized dresser should require roughly 0.5 gallons (1.9 L) of paint.",
    "It can be really hard to remove oil-based primer from a roller.",

    "For rougher pine, use a thick-napped roller instead.",
    "You can use a larger roller if your furniture is larger.",

    "Use an angled or flat brush with natural bristles to paint details, curves, or hard-to-reach areas of your furniture.",
    "Use back-and-forth strokes to cover each area of your furniture.",
    "Paint in the direction of the wood grain whenever possible.",
    "Leave no visible surface unprimed.",
    "It\u2019s okay if the coat of primer isn\u2019t perfectly even in color\u2014especially if you\u2019re using a gloss paint\u2014but every surface should be primed.",
    "Use your brush to work around any handles or edges of painter\u2019s tape.",
    "Avoid drips by brushing with light pressure and allowing your brush to move in your wrist as you paint.",
    "Wait 12-24 hours for your primer to dry.",

    "You can use oil-based, alkyd or latex paint.",
    "If you\u2019re painting a furniture item that you touch frequently, like a dresser or table, choose an alkyd-based paint.",
    "Latex paint will rub off more easily over time, especially if the furniture is being used regularly.",
    "For decorative pieces, latex will hold up just fine.",
    "If you\u2019re painting kitchen or bathroom cabinets, use an oil-based paint.",
    "It will resist moisture more efficiently than an alkyd or latex paint.",
    "If you want a distressed look and you use the furniture regularly, go ahead and use a latex paint.",
    "It will wear away and reveal the grain underneath over time.",
    "Fill a paint tray with \u20442\u2013\u20444 gallon (1.9\u20132.8 L) of paint.",

    "A roller will be easier to use and will result in more a more consistent look when it comes to larger, flat surfaces though.",
    "Depending on the size of your furniture, you can use a \u20444\u20133 in (1.9\u20137.6 cm) brush.",
    "Roll larger surfaces with a 6 in (15 cm) roller.",
    "Use a foam roller if you\u2019re painting unfinished pine.",

    "Wait 6-12 hours between coats to ensure that the previous layer has fully dried.",
    "Sand lightly in between coats if you have any drips or blemishes that you want to cover.",
    "Apply a protective finish if you want to preserve your paint job.",
    "If you\u2019re happy with the look and feel of your painted furniture, you can stop after you\u2019ve painted it.",
    "If you want to protect the paint, add a layer of polycrylic protective finish.",
    "Use a natural-bristle brush and a small foam roller to cover every surface of your furniture.",
    "Wait 72 hours to give the finish enough time to fully settle.Tip: Polycrylic protective finishes come in liquid or spray form.",
    "You can use the spray version of the product if you\u2019d like to get a stippled texture on your furniture.",
    "The finish won\u2019t change the color of the paint job, but if you get a glossy version of the finish, it could make your furniture more reflective.",
    "If you don\u2019t wait at least 3 days before using or touching your furniture, it will be sticky and you could risk ruining the finish."
