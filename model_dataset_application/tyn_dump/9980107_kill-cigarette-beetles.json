  "text":" Eliminating Bugs through Cleaning Give your home a thorough cleaning and vacuuming. Any spilled food has the potential to become a food source for cigarette beetles. The most effective way to eliminate them long-term is to remove these food sources. Every few weeks, give your home another deep cleaning to stem repeat infestations. These beetles often live on food sources you cannot see, such as crumbs and other insects. Vacuum carpeting and use a hose attachment to reach tables and cabinets. Discard items that are infested. Many items that are infested are difficult to save because the beetles do so much damage. Any food will still have the bugs in it, even if you successfully sterilize it. Throw away these items as soon as you discover them to prevent the beetles from spreading further. You can wrap items in plastic to make sure the beetles don\u2019t escape.

It should also ensure that all beetle eggs and larvae are rinsed out. Clean your containers out if you notice cigarette beetles nearby or suspect the food inside is infested. Using Chemicals and Temperature Treatments Install pheromone traps in busy areas. You can order cigarette beetle traps online. These traps, made of paper and cardboard, lure in adult beetles. Hang them high up in areas you suspect are infested. If beetles end up in the trap, you may uncover a nearby spot where the beetles gather. These traps are often used in commercial businesses to prevent infestations. The traps cannot stop infestations. They can help you locate infestations and show you if there are beetles present in your home. Remove items from the spot you wish to spray.

If you are cleaning a cabinet, for example, each item inside it needs to be inspected individually. You usually cannot treat these items with an insecticide. Spray an insecticide to eliminate adult beetles. Purchase a pyrethrin or resmethrin insect spray, which you can find online or at many general stores.
