Make sure that the bowl is deep enough to submerge all of your chicken pieces. Marinating and Breading the Chicken Cut the chicken apart into 10 pieces. You will need: 2 wings, 2 legs (drumsticks), 2 thighs, and 2 breasts. Cut each chicken breast in half so that you have 4 breast pieces total. Try to use a chicken that is around 3 pounds (1.4 kg). You can also buy chicken pieces separately. For example, you could use 10 chicken breasts. Leave the skin on the chicken pieces. This will make it nice and crispy.

Cover the dish with plastic wrap to keep the marinade from spoiling. If it is very hot in your kitchen, then you could marinate the chicken in the fridge at first, then halfway through the marinating time, transfer it to the counter. Dredge the chicken through the flour-spice blend. Take a piece of chicken out of the buttermilk, and let the excess mixture drip off. Place the chicken into the spice-flour blend, then flip it over so that both sides get covered. Transfer the chicken to a baking sheet. Repeat this step for each piece of chicken. Work 1 piece at a time. Keep the chicken pieces in the buttermilk until you are ready to dredge them. Let the chicken pieces rest on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes. Discard any leftover spiced flour. It came into contact with raw meat, so it is no longer safe to use. Be sure to discard any leftover buttermilk marinade; it's been contaminated by raw meat, so you can't reuse it. Frying the Chicken Fill a pot or deep fryer with at least 5 inches (13 cm) of vegetable oil. The oil needs to be deep enough so that you can submerge the chicken pieces. Plan on using about 2 quarts (1.9 L) of oil. You can use another neutral-tasting oil. Avoid olive oil, however, as the flavor is too intense. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it is 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). This may take a few minutes, but do not step away from the fryer.
