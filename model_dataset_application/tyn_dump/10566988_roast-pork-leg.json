    "Use enough marinade to cover the pork once across and save the rest.",
    "Store the remaining marinade in an airtight container and refrigerate it.",
    "Place your marinated pork leg in the refrigerator for 4-12 hours.",
    "Cover your roasting pan with its lid and place it into the refrigerator.",
    "At the halfway point, turn the leg around to help the marinade move around the entire pork.",
    "Turn it around once about 1 to 2 hours before you remove it if you'd like.",
    "If you don't have a lid for your roasting pan, cover it with cling wrap and be sure that there are no cracks.",
    "Remove the pork from the fridge and let it sit uncovered for 30 minutes before cooking.",
    "Place the roasting pan onto a counter or other safe area and let it sit at room temperature.",
    "By letting the pork sit, the temperature increase when it enters the oven isn't as sharp, which promotes more even cooking.",
    "Be sure that the cover is removed.",
    "Preheat your oven to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C).",
    "Electric ovens typically take about 10 to 15 minutes to preheat.",
    "For gas ovens, they should preheat in about 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "Position the oven rack into the lowest position and then turn your oven to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C).",
    "Use an oven thermometer if you have one, as they are often more accurate.",
    "Roast your pork leg for 30 minutes at 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C).",
    "Place your uncovered pork onto the lower oven rack and let it roast.",
    "After 30 minutes, check on the meat\u2014it should be falling apart.",
    "If it is, turn your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C).",
    "If the pork leg meat isn't falling apart yet, continue to cook it in 5-minute intervals and check on it afterward until it is.",
    "Continue roasting your pork at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) for 5 to 5.5 hours.",
    "Every 30 minutes, scoop up some of the marinade you set aside and pour it over the top of the pork.",
    "This is called basting, which keeps your pork moist with marinade.",
    "Be sure to save enough for the entire duration of the roast.",
    "If you have an instant-read meat thermometer, insert it into the thickest part of the pork and check that it is 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C).",
    "Let your roast sit for 20 to 30 minutes and then serve.",
    "Loosely cover the roasting pan with foil during cooling.",
    "When you're ready to serve, cut it into 1 to 2 inch (2.5 to 5.1 cm) slices depending on your preference.",
    "Serve it with your choice of sides, such as brussels sprouts, fruits, or green beans with hazelnuts.",
    "Store your leftover pork covered for 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator or 2 to 3 months in the freezer."
