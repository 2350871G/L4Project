  "text":" Setting up Your Vacuum Pump Fill the pump with vacuum oil. Before you use your vacuum pump, make sure it is full of clean vacuum pump oil. Unscrew the oil fill cap, typically located on the top of the pump, and look on the interior edge of the opening for the fill line. Fill the opening with oil until it reaches that line.

Loose seals can compromise your vacuum. In your car, your high-pressure port will generally be physically higher than the low-pressure port. Open your manifold valves. Once you have your gauges in place, you will need to use the valves on your AC system that opens and closes the service port to the refrigerant lines. With the valves closed, your gauges should have little to no pressure reading. Pulling the Vacuum Start your pump. After you are sure everything has been securely connected, use the switch device on your vacuum pump to turn it on. You should be able to hear the vacuum running once it is switched on. If you are trying to start the pump in cold weather, open the intake ports until the pump reaches normal running speed. Then, close it off again. Open the side gauge valve. Once your vacuum is on, you will need to open the gauge valves, located on the side of each gauge. This allows the vacuum to start pulling air out of the system. If you are unsure which way you need to turn your valves to open them, check the manual that came with your gauges or vacuum. Allow the vacuum to run for 15-30 minutes. Let your vacuum run at full operating speed for at least 15 minutes and up to 30 to completely pull the air out of your AC system.
