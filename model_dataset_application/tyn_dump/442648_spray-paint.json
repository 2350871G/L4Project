          "description":"Whenever you spray paint, you should always work outdoors in a well-ventilated area because the fumes from the paint can cause respiratory damage. Keep in mind that spray paint won\u2019t adhere well if it is too cold or wet outside, so wait for a time when humidity is below 65% and it is sunny and warm. Place your newspaper, drop cloth, or tarp down. If you are working outside, you can use weights (like rocks) to keep your protective materials from blowing around in the wind. Be sure to spread your protective materials far enough out, otherwise your yard or driveway may have end up with a light misting of color from the paint. Tape off any areas you don\u2019t want to paint. Be sure the edges are sealed well to the surface to prevent paint from leaking underneath."

This will help to make it easier for you to spray paint the item because you won\u2019t have to be bending over as much. Having the item up on sawhorses will also make it easier to reach areas that might be hard to reach if the item is on the ground."

Then, you can spray the paint into the box to spray paint the item and this will reduce the chances that paint will end up on nearby surfaces. You can also put items on a small piece of cardboard or a turntable inside of the box to make it easier to turn the item around as you paint."

Take a few minutes to wipe off any debris that might be clinging to the surface of the material you will be spray painting. You can use a damp rag only or use a household cleaner to clean your surface if it is extra dirty. Just make sure to dry the surface completely before you paint it. If there is any sticky residue on the surface of your item, such as the remnants of a price tag sticker, scrape off the residue and then use a household cleaner to remove the rest. You may want to use sandpaper to smooth out rough surfaces. This will help to produce a smooth finish when you spray paint the item."

The safety goggles will help to protect you in case any of the paint blows back towards your face, and because spray paint is toxic, disposable gloves and a ventilator mask are necessary. Put these on before you do any painting. Respirators cost around $20 to $30, but this is much cheaper than a visit to the doctor for respiratory problems.

Apply an even coating of primer to the entire object. Then, wait for the primer to dry completely. Check the primer can to find out how long it will take to dry.

Also, make sure to overlap each of your passes slightly to ensure that you do not have gaps in between the areas you spray paint. Hold the can of paint about 8 inches (20.3 cm) away from your object, and move the can back and forth slowly at a rate of about one foot per second. Don\u2019t apply a heavy coat because the paint may drip and be tacky longer. This will make it more likely that your paint will get smudged. Instead, apply multiple thin coats of paint to your project and let each coat dry completely before applying a new one. Keep in mind that the first coat will likely be splotchy and show the original color through the paint, but you will cover up any splotchy areas with the second coat of paint."
