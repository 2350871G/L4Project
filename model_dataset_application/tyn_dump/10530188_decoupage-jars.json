A large jam jar or mason jar is a great start because they are big and easy to hold. Another thing to consider is the appeal of the jar. A basic mason jar may be too plain or not interesting enough to you. If the jar has a unique shape, this can heighten the appeal of the end look once the project is completed."

If the adhesive proves stubborn, use a rubbing oil to assist, such as orange oil or eucalyptus oil. Glass jars also tend to get a lot of fingerprints on the outside. Wash the surface of the jar you chose with a cloth, mild soap, and warm water. If soap and water are not enough, use some rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball to wipe the surface of the glass.
