Different woods impart different smoke flavors, so be sure to match your wood choice with the kind of food you want to cook. Oak and hickory are suitable for anything and are great starter woods if you\u2019re new to smoking. Use apple for fish and vegetables. If you\u2019re cooking poultry, try apple, pecan, or cherry. Mesquite is a very strong wood and is best for tough, larger cuts like beef brisket. You can buy larger wood chunks if you\u2019re smoking a very large piece of meat--the process is still the same!"
