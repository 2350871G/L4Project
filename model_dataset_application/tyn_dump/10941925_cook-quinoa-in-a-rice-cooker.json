          "description":"Put 1 cup (170 g) of quinoa into a fine mesh strainer or sieve and hold it under cold running water. Use your hands to swish the quinoa around as you rinse it. It's important to rinse quinoa before cooking it since this will remove the seed's bitter covering. If you don\u2019t have a sieve fine enough to rinse the quinoa, try lining a colander with cheesecloth or coffee filters instead."

          "description":"Put the lid on your rice cooker and turn it on. If your rice cooker has separate settings for white and brown rice, choose the white rice option. Both white rice and quinoa need about 15 minutes to cook. Avoid lifting the lid as the quinoa cooks since it won't steam properly if moisture escapes. You may need to read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for your rice cooker if you\u2019re not sure exactly how to operate it. Did You Know? There may be slight flavor differences between white, black, and red quinoa, but they should all take about the same time to cook."

          "description":"Keep the lid on the rice cooker and unplug the machine. The quinoa will finish steaming as it rests for a few minutes. After about 5 minutes, lift the lid and fluff the quinoa gently with a fork. Fluffing the quinoa will loosen any grains that are compacted or stuck together, helping your quinoa have a lighter texture."

          "description":"You can serve your quinoa plain, in place of rice or other elements of your meal. However, you can also incorporate quinoa into dishes and other sides. For instance, you can chill your quinoa and mix it with vinaigrette and shredded vegetables to make a cold quinoa salad. To store leftover quinoa, put it into an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the quinoa for up to 2 months. To defrost it, put the container in the refrigerator overnight."

          "description":"One of the simplest ways to add flavor to your quinoa is to substitute the water with vegetable stock or chicken broth. Just replace the water with an equal amount of the stock or broth. If you\u2019re concerned that stock will make your quinoa too salty, try using low-sodium broth or stock instead. Try adding a squirt of lemon juice to the liquid for a bright burst of color."

          "headline":"Add spices to give the quinoa a unique flavor.",
          "description":"Stir up to 2 tablespoons (12 g) of your favorite dried seasonings into the cooking liquid. The quinoa will absorb the flavors as it cooks. Try to pair the seasonings you use in the quinoa with the rest of the meal you\u2019re making. For example, you might try adding:\nCumin, lime juice, and cilantro if you\u2019re adding your quinoa to tacos or burritos. Curry powder if you\u2019re making an Indian or Caribbean-inspired dish. Chinese five-spice powder to complement an Asian meal. Cajun seasoning mix for a Southern kick. Tip: If you'd like to use fresh herbs, wait until the quinoa has finished cooking, then stir them in just before you serve the dish."

          "headline":"Stir in aromatics or oil for another way to flavor the quinoa.",
          "description":"Toss in a clove of crushed garlic, a piece of lemon peel, or a sprig of fresh rosemary to add an instant flavor boost to your quinoa. You can also pour in 1 to 2 teaspoons (4.9 to 9.9 ml) of a flavored oil, such as walnut, toasted sesame, or hazelnut. Remove the garlic, peel, or herbs just before serving the quinoa. Try using oils that are infused with different flavors, such as herbs or chilis. You can even make your own infused oils, if you\u2019d like!"

          "description":"For a nice change from your morning oatmeal, cook a batch of quinoa in the rice cooker, but use coconut milk instead of water. Stir in your favorite toppings, like fresh fruit, honey, or ground cinnamon just before serving. If you prefer, you can use regular milk or whichever milk alternative you prefer, such as almond, hemp, or soy milk. If you want to use dried fruit, add it to the rice cooker when you add the quinoa. This will allow the fruit to plump up as it cooks."
