Shake the colander or toss the beans by hand periodically to ensure that the water reaches every part. When you\u2019re finished, allow the excess water to drain out of the colander completely. A thorough rinse is also useful for doing away with traces of insects, fertilizer, or chemicals, which are often found on freshly-picked veggies."

          "description":"Gather up a handful of beans and line them up end-to-end on your cutting board. Then, using a sharp kitchen knife, slice off the fibrous stem ends and discard them. Repeat the trimming process for all of the beans you plan on freezing. Only remove about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from each end so there\u2019s still plenty of edible bean left."

          "headline":"De-string the bean pods.",
          "description":"Like many other varieties of shell beans, the pods of runner beans are held together by a tough string running down the middle. You can remove this string by grabbing it from one end and pulling it away it one easy motion. Make sure you strip the entire string, or you could end up chewing on it later. The pod strings will usually start coming away on their own when you trim the stems. If not, you may have to get them started with your fingernail. Try not to miss any strings. Getting them stuck in your teeth isn\u2019t a pleasant experience."

          "description":"If you tend to slice or break your beans into smaller segments, doing it before you put them into storage will save you valuable time later on. Use clean, precise cuts to reduce the beans to a uniform size. Many chefs prefer square or diamond-shaped pieces for beans with broad, flat pods like runners. Avoid cutting them too small, or they\u2019ll be more likely to stick together when frozen. Once you\u2019ve precut your runner beans, you\u2019ll be able to simply take them out of storage, dump them into a pot of water, and cook them to a tender, flavorful finish without the hassle of having to prepare them."

Make sure the pot you\u2019re using is big enough to hold all of the beans you want to freeze. If you're preparing a particularly large crop of fresh beans, you may need to blanch them in separate batches.

At the end of this time, the beans should appear plump and bright green. As the beans boil, they\u2019ll take in moisture, which will allow them to freeze easily. Keep an eye on the color and texture of the runners as you\u2019re blanching them. If they look exceptionally dark or soft, they may be in danger of overcooking."

Plunge the runner beans into a separate bowl filled with equal parts water and ice to neutralize the heat of the boiling water. Alternatively, you can transfer them back to the colander and run them directly under the faucet. Placing the beans in cold water immediately after blanching them will halt the heating process and prevent them from actually cooking through. It will also lower their temperature gradually in preparation for freezing."

The drier the beans are when they go into the freezer, the less likely they are to form ice crystals. Be careful not to mash or break the beans while you\u2019re drying them.

Check your freezer bags for holes, splits, broken seals, and other signs of damage before closing them up.

Similarly, you'll want to play it safe and throw out bags that show signs of damage after being placed in the freezer. When exposed directly to the cold for too long, the taste and texture of the beans will effectively be ruined. Blanched runner beans are more likely to freezer burn if you don't dry them off thoroughly before packing them up.
