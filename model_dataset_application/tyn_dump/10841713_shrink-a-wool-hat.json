Adjust the machine to the shortest wash cycle to protect the fibres of the wool. This method achieves the best results on beanies that are 100% wool. Wash the beanie by itself to stop other garments from agitating the delicate fibres of the hat and causing it to get too fluffy."

          "description":"The detergent helps to moisturise the yarn and slightly agitates the fibres. This encourages the wool to shrink down to a smaller size. Start the washing machine once you have added the detergent. Unless your hat is white, avoid using bleaching or brightening laundry detergent, as this can damage the colours in your hat. Avoid using regular laundry detergent as this can dry out the fibres in the hat."

Avoid putting the hat on a high-heat drying cycle, as this can cause it to shrink too much. If you don\u2019t have a dryer, consider going to a laundry centre, as air-drying your hat can cause it to return to its original size."

          "description":"Put your hat on to see if it is a good fit. If it is still too big, re-wash it on a hot cycle and then dry it in the dryer again. This will cause it to shrink approximately another size. Keep repeating this washing and drying process until you are happy that your hat fits you comfortably. Continue to dry the hat on a cool heat."

          "description":"Turn your hat over and look inside the cavity of the hat for a band that is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. Hold the band where the back of your head would sit and then pull it back toward yourself. Pull the band back about 1 centimetre (0.39 in) to allow room for the hat filler. Most woollen hats will have an inside band; however, if your hat doesn\u2019t have one, simply skip this step. This method works for hats such as fedoras, newsboy caps, tweed hats, and floppy hats."

          "description":"A hat filler is a small foam cushion that helps to reduce the size of your hat. These come in different sizes according to how much they will reduce the size of your hat. For example, a 1 centimetre (0.39 in) hat filler will reduce the size of your hat by 1 centimetre (0.39 in). Remove the sticky back from the hat filler and then place it inside the band off your hat. If your hat doesn\u2019t have a band, simply stick the hat filler to the inside rim of the hat. Hat fillers can be purchased inexpensively from home stores, hat stores, and online."

The hat is a good fit if you are able to fit 1 finger snugly between the hat and your head and if it fits comfortably on your head without feeling tight. If the hat feels loose or wobbly, this indicates that it is still too big."

Continue to spray the hat until the entire hat feels damp to touch. Try to spray the hat evenly, as this helps the hat to maintain its shape when it dries. This method works for woollen brimmed hats, such as fedoras, newsboy caps, tweed hats, and floppy hats."

Place your hat somewhere warm, such as in front of your heat pump, or on top of your hot water cylinder. Expose your hat to heat for about 1 hour to cause it to shrink approximately 1 centimetre (0.39 in). If you live in a sunny area, park your car in a sunny spot, close all the windows and place your hat on the dashboard. This will achieve similar results to putting your hat in the dryer."

The continued exposure to the heat will encourage the hat to shrink an extra 0.5 centimetres (0.20 in). Continue to repeat this spraying and drying process to shrink your hat further."
