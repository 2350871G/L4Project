Pour-over brewing requires a fine grind (like granulated sugar), traditional drip coffee is best with a medium grind (like sea salt) and coffee presses require a coarse grind. Over-extracted coffee tends to taste considerably worse than coarser, under-extracted coffee, so when in doubt go for an under-extracted (coarse) grind.

With the right grind, quality of beans, and pure, fresh water, you can make a brew that rivals that of a coffee press. For flat-bottom filters be sure to use a medium-sized grind, like the sea salt grind used for a coffee press. Meanwhile, cone-shaped filters are best with a finer grind, like granulated sugar. After you've got your grind right, just measure out your coffee (2 tablespoons for every six ounces of water) and press \"Brew\" on the machine! While the convenience is tempting, if you want Starbucks-quality coffee every time, only make however much coffee you need for one sitting. Don't reheat coffee or you will dull the flavor."

With the pour-over, you can only make a single cup of coffee, but it will be wonderful. Boil your water, remembering the 2:6 ration from above, but adding a little extra. Use this extra hot water to moisten your filter. Once you've boiled your water a pre-moistened your filter, grind your coffee using a fine grind, like that used in cone-shaped filters. It should resemble granulated sugar. Once you've got your coffee measured out and sitting in your filter, pour your hot water over the grounds, but pause when you've filled it half-way. This allows the coffee to be fully and even saturated, developing flavor. After your pause, pour over the rest, going in small circles to distribute the water evenly.
