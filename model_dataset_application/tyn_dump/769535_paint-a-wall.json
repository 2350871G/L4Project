Make sure to line up the edges of the tape precisely, or you could end up with a lopsided paint job. You can pick up painter\u2019s tape from any home improvement store, as well as most major supermarkets and pharmacies. Look for tape in different sizes.

A gallon of primer should be enough to take care of most painting projects. Always use a primer when painting interior walls.

Mixing your paint prior to starting a big project is essential, whether you're using a brand new can or one that's been sitting on the shelf for a while. Begin painting at the trim by hand. Dip the tip of your paintbrush about 2\" into the paint, letting the excess drip off.

Follow along the painter\u2019s tape and work your way down using smooth, linear strokes until you\u2019ve completed the outer perimeter of the wall. Painting 2-3\u201d outward from the trim will allow you to easily go over the rest using a roller. Pause periodically to rewet your brush when your strokes become faint.
