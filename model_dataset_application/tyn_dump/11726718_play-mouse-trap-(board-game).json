If the cheese pile is empty, take the cheese pieces from the player with the most cheese pieces.

If the player with the most cheese has less than three pieces, just take the number of pieces the opponent does have. If two or more opponents are tied for the most Cheese pieces, the player whose turn it is may take them all from one opponent or divide the amount between them. Lose Cheese Spaces. If a mouse lands on one of these spaces, return the indicated number of cheese pieces to the cheese pile.

A player landing on this space does nothing\n\nThe Loop. These are the six spaces at the end of the path beginning with the Safe space and ending with the Cheese Wheel space. This section of the path is called The Loop and it is where mice are captured. When players arrive at The Loop, they take turns circling it as many times as necessary until the Mouse Trap is completely built and only one mouse remains uncaptured on the gameboard. Cheese Wheel Space. Every time a mouse lands on the Cheese Wheel space, the player takes two cheese pieces from the cheese pile. If the cheese pile is empty, the player can take any pieces they are entitled to from the opponent with the most cheese pieces.

The next player to land on a Build space would position part #2 (Gear Support) in place and so on until the Mouse Trap is completed. After placing a part of the Mouse Trap on the gameboard, players should immediately take one Cheese piece from the pile. Whenever a mouse lands on a Build space that's located on The Loop section of the game path, add two parts to the Mouse Trap and take two cheese pieces from the cheese pile. When the Mouse Trap is complete, players do nothing when their mouse lands on a Build space. Realize that in this game, trapping pieces on the board must be set up to create a chain reaction.
