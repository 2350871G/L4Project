These gels can also make acrylic paint thicker and give it a textured finish. Use this option if you\u2019d like this type of composition. Some examples of textured gels are stucco, modeling paste, sand gel, and resin gel.

Any more could make the paint unstable. You could add less gel if you want thinner paint. Just don\u2019t exceed a 1:4 ratio. If you\u2019ve never done this before, start with a small amount.

You\u2019re now ready to paint! You can use your brush or a palette knife to mix water-based thickening gel in. If you\u2019re using a textured gel, use a palette knife to mix it in.
