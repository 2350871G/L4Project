      "description":"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (191 degrees Celsius). Skin the salmon fillet with a sharp knife. De-scale the skin with a fish scaler. Rinse the salmon under cool running water and pat dry. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Lightly brush olive oil on both sides of the salmon skin. Sprinkle your favorite seasonings on both sides. To keep it simple, simply sprinkle a little bit of salt. Place the salmon skin, shiny side up, on the baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes or until the skin is crispy. Allow the salmon skin to cool before eating."

      "description":"Preheat a large skillet with vegetable oil over medium high heat. Use just enough oil to cover the bottom of the skillet. Skin the salmon fillet with a sharp knife. De-scale the skin with a fish scaler. Rinse the salmon skin under cool running water and pat dry. Slice the salmon skin into 1 to 2 inch (2.5 to 5.1 cm) width strips. Sprinkle both sides of the salmon skin with your choice of seasonings. Dredge in flour, if desired. Fry the salmon skin strips until they become crispy, approximately 3 minutes. Drain the strips of salmon on paper towels and allow to cool."

      "headline":"Prepare salmon skins with the flesh in the broiler.",
      "description":"Preheat the broiler. De-scale the salmon fillet with a fish scaler. Rinse the salmon under cool running water and pat dry with paper towels. Brush the skin with soft butter and sprinkle the flesh side with your choice of seasonings. Refrigerate the skin for 20 minutes so the butter will firm up. Place the salmon fillet into the broiler and cook for about 8 minutes, until the salmon is cooked through and the skin has become crispy."
