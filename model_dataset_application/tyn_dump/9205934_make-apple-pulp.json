You can remove these unusable bits by running the pulp through a food mill or fine mesh strainer. Force as much of the pulp through the strainer as you can, then dispose of what\u2019s left. To maximize the amount of pulp you end up with, make sure you don't let any good fruit left behind in the pulper go to waste. A cider press will take care of the work of wringing the liquids out of the pulp for you, which can save you a lot of time and effort if you plan on using the juice separately."
