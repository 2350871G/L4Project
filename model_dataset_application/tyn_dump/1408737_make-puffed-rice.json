Return the rice to the bowl and add fresh water. Keep rinsing until the water that's draining runs clear. This will remove excess starch from the rice so it doesn't clump or stick together as it cooks. Use any type of rice, such as basmati rice, sushi rice, brown rice, or long-grain rice."

Begin checking the rice after 18 minutes. The amount of time it takes will depend on the type of rice you're making. For example, wild rice will take 25 to 30 minutes to cook although short-grain rice will cook much faster."
