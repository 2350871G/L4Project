      "description":"Good paintballers need to learn \"marker\" positioning. You should put on your mask when doing this to replicate firing during play. You can use a laser pointer taped to the barrel of the marker to represent where you would hit if you fired a paintball. Now, with the pointer on and the mask on, put it into firing position. Learn that position. If you can, (put the marker barrel-down) and try to estimate where the shot would hit before you even bring up your marker. Quickly bring up your marker into firing position. Practice this for a while, and then without the laser pointer - but do not let the opponent see the light or else the opponent can trace it back it you and tag you if too many opponents notice you before you realize it and then have another target."

      "headline":"Get the best from your equipment.",
      "description":"Even expensive paintball guns can have bad firing rates - this can be fixed. Take your middle and index finger and place them in the air as if they were a pair of scissors. Position your thumb straight and pinkie and ring finger like you're holding a gun. Take your middle and index fingers and place them on the trigger. Start pulling the trigger slowly back and forth, then get faster and faster. This is called \"walking the trigger\". You will have to put more pressure on those fingers in a real marker trigger. Try this out with different guns, and find the one that you can fire with the fastest. There are market triggers available for almost all guns. (This will only work for markers with a \"double trigger.\" That is, a trigger that has room for two fingers.) This technique is also called \"spray and pray\" since you are not usually concerned with accuracy; only with getting a lot of paint into the air quickly."

After you do get your target, make sure he is the only threat shooting at you.

One way to perfect your sharpshooting is to practice in front of a mirror.

Now open your hopper. Keep a finger on the trigger, take a pod out then pop the top of the pod, and pour in the paint into the gun. Throw your pod on the ground (don't worry, you will get them back), close the hopper and start firing. You may not want to yell \"reloading\" because the other team will hear as well, and try to bunker you. Practice reloading and you won't have to ask your team to cover you."
