This is not to be undertaken lightly because it is expensive and time consuming, but it may be the best option to remove very deep staining. Sanding removes the top layer of wood and will effectively polish out the spray by buffing away the surface layer it lives in. Contact a professional contractor for a quote to perform this work without damaging your floor. Sanding is simpler to do with unfinished wood (a deck, for example) but can be accomplished with finished hardwood inside. A professional can help you match your existing finish properly. A contractor can replace and paint a piece of your baseboard if necessary. If the spray sunk deep into the wood, a contractor can also help you replaced smelly or damaged areas."
