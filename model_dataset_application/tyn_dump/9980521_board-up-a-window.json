Use a circular saw to cut the plywood. For example, if your window measures 48 inches (120 cm) tall and 24 inches (61 cm) wide, then your piece of plywood should be 56 inches (140 cm) tall and 32 inches (81 cm) wide. If the window has an extended sill, you only need to add 4 inches (10 cm) to the height before cutting the plywood. If you don\u2019t have a circular saw, you can take your plywood to a home improvement store to have it cut for you."
