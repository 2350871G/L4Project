Try to line the panels up so the rows are even. This will make seaming them together easier. Seam 1 side of the cardigan up to the armhole. Cut a piece of yarn so it's 3 times as long as the length of the side you're seaming. Use a mattress stitch to seam from the bottom of the cardigan up to the armhole. Stitch together the back piece with 1 of the side panels to leave space for the armhole near the top.

Repeat the side seam to join together the other side panel with the back piece. Remember to leave the same amount of room for the other armhole and weave in the ends. Making the Sleeves Chain a new row and slip stitch it to the join in the round. You'll need to work the sleeve in the round before you sew it to the armhole. Chain up a new row and then join it together. This will allow you to keep crocheting in a circle.

Once you've chained up 2 stitches, double-crochet across every stitch in the row. When you get to the end of the row, slip stitch to join the rows. Chain 2 stitches again, but don't turn the work. This will make the wrist of the sleeve. If you'd like to make a ribbed stitch, crochet the next few rows by alternating a front and back post double crochet. Half-double crochet each stitch, join the row, chain 2, and turn. To make the main row of your sleeve, half-double crochet into every stitch. When you reach the end of the row, use the slip stitch to join it to the next row. Chain up 2 stitches and turn the work before you start the next row. Repeat the row for 12 rows. Continue to hdc, slip stitch join, chain 2, and turn for the next 12 rows. This will create the majority of the sleeve. You should have a total of 18 rows on your sleeve. Alternate increasing rows with half-double crochet rows until row 30. To make the upper arm of the sleeve wider, add 2 half-double crochet stitches into every 5th stitch on your row. Slip stitch to join the end of the row and chain 2 before you turn the work; that will be your increase row. Work all of the following row in the half-double crochet stitch. Repeat this pattern until you reach row 30. Half-double crochet each stitch until your desired length. Once you've made 30 rows on your sleeve, begin half-crocheting in every row. Continue to slip stitch join and turn the work at the end of each row. Crochet and finish off once you've reached:\nX-Small: round 52\nSmall: round 54\nMedium: round 55\nLarge: round 56\nXL: round 57\n2XL: round 59\n3XL: round 60 Make another sleeve and sew each to the armholes. Repeat all of the sleeve steps to crochet another sleeve and finish it off. Leave a long yarn tail (at least 18 inches (46 cm) long) and use the whip stitch to sew each sleeve into the armhole space. Weave in the ends. Crocheting the Edges Join the yarn to the bottom of the front panel. Look at the cardigan and locate the bottom corner on the right panel. Join the yarn to this last row. You'll be working the edge around the cardigan. Double-crochet the hemline, if desired. If you'd like your cardigan to have a professional look, chain 2 and double crochet every stitch around the hemline. Keep in mind that you'll need to crochet along the bottom of the front panel, across the side seam, over the back panel, across the other side seam, and over the other front panel. Keep double-crocheting to make the ribbed edge. Continue to double-crochet stitch along the edge so you complete 8 rows. The ribbed edge will add about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of fabric to the existing edges of the cardigan. Double-crochet along the whole edge. Crochet 1 double-crochet stitch into each stitch on the side of the front panels. Keep double-crocheting around the neck and down onto the side of the other front panel. Finish off and weave in the ends to create a professional-looking ribbed edge. Remember to work about 8 rows and turn the work after each row.",
