  "text":" Freezing Tomatoes Wash tomatoes thoroughly after gathering them from the garden. Wipe them off or allow them to air dry. Arrange a layer of dry tomatoes on a baking tray. Make room in your freezer for the tray. Pop the tray in the freezer to flash-freeze the tomatoes. Keep them uncovered for 15 to 30 minutes. The larger the tomatoes, the longer they will need to stay in the freezer initially. Remove the tray. Ensure that the tomatoes are hard. Pour the tomatoes into large freezer bags and remove all of the air. Label and date your frozen tomatoes. They should be used within two or three months. Place them back in the freezer until you are ready to use them. Remove them and place them to thaw on your counter. After thawing, you can easily peel away the loosened skins. Canning Tomatoes Gather approximately 21 lb (9.5 kg) of tomatoes for seven quarts of canned tomatoes.  Prepare your boiling water canner on the stove. You will need to bring it to a boil and sterilize your jars in the water for at least 10 minutes. Keep the jars warm until you are ready to pour in the tomato sauce. Wash your lids and rims with soapy water. Pour boiling water over them to sterilize them. Wash the tomatoes. Remove any rotten or bruised tomatoes for immediate use. Heat another stockpot or large saucepan full of water. Prepare large ice bath beside the stove top. Blanch the tomatoes for 30 to 60 seconds. When the skins split, they are done. Place them in the ice bath. Slip off the skins. Take a knife and core the tomatoes by slicing the center top of the tomato with a circular cut. Slice them in half or keep them whole for canning.

If it does, arrange the tomatoes on a baking tray and dehydrate them according to this recipe. Slice tomatoes in half from top to tip.

Arrange them on your dehydrator tray with the cut side up. Ensure there is one-half inch (1.3cm) between each tomato half so that air can flow through. Set them to 135\u00baF (57\u00baC). Allow them to dehydrate for 18 to 24 hours. Cool them and place them in airtight containers, such as canning jars. Fill to the top. You can also grind them in a coffee grinder to make tomato powder. Rehydrate them in stock, water or wine before they go into your next sauce.  Roasting Tomatoes Wash your tomatoes thoroughly. Dry them with a paper towel. Preheat your oven to 400\u00baF (204\u00baC). Line several baking trays with aluminum foil. Grease the foil with olive oil. Cut your tomatoes in half from top to bottom. Squeeze the tomato seeds out into a bowl or remove them with a tsp. Place the tomatoes on the foil-lined tray with the cut side up.  Season the tomatoes with olive oil.
