Squeeze out as much moisture as possible. If too much excess remains, it can seep into the bread, causing it to turn soft and mushy."

The buttered side will need to be on the outside as the sandwich cooks, so when you assemble the sandwiches, the non-buttered side needs to face up. If you do not use wax paper, you may end losing too much of the butter after you lift the sandwich up."

Slice against the grain instead of with it. Slow cooked corned beef is already tender, but if you slice it against the grain, it will be even tenderer.

Layer equal amounts of sliced corned beef, cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing onto six slices of your toasted bread. Top each sandwich with another slice of rye bread. Each sandwich should have two slices of cheese on it and as much as 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of Russian dressing. Remove the sauerkraut from the slow cooker using a slotted spoon, draining as much liquid as possible from the sauerkraut before adding it to the sandwich. Cook the Reuben sandwiches on the stove.

Slice and serve. Transfer each finished sandwich to a cutting board and cut in half with a serrated knife before serving. Vegan Version Combine the dressing ingredients. Place the vegan mayonnaise, ketchup, and relish in a small bowl and whisk together until well combined. Set aside until ready to use. This is a vegan alternative to Thousand Island dressing, which usually contains standard mayonnaise. Heat the cider vinegar, soy sauce, peppercorns, and caraway in a saucepan. Place the four ingredients in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture begins to simmer but has not yet come to a full boil. Heating the ingredients will help the flavors blend more thoroughly. Add the tempeh. Carefully place the slices of tempeh into the simmering seasoning mixture. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes. Stir the tempeh periodically as it cooks to prevent it from burning or sticking. By the end of this step, you will have little to no liquid left in the saucepan. Heat oil in a separate skillet. Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil to a large skillet and heat over medium for a couple of minutes. When done, the oil should be glossy enough to look as though it is \u201cshimmering.\u201d Do not allow it to become so hot that it starts to smoke, though. Saut\u00e9 the tempeh. Add the tempeh to the hot oil and saut\u00e9 for 3 to 4 minutes, turning halfway through to cook both sides. This part of the process makes the tempeh slightly crispy. Heat oil in another frying pan. Grease a frying pan or griddle with a light coating of olive oil and heat for a couple of minutes over medium heat. You could also use cooking spray instead of olive oil, if desired. Assemble the sandwiches. Lay out 4 slices of rye bread. On each slice, place 1/4 of the tempeh, 1 slice of vegan cheese, 1/4 of the sauerkraut, and 1/4 of the vegan Thousand Island dressing. Top each sandwich with another slice of rye bread. Cook until the bread turns golden brown. Place the assembled sandwiches in the oiled frying pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Each side should turn a light golden brown when done. Serve hot. Remove the finished sandwiches and place them on a cutting board. Cut in half with a serrated knife and enjoy.",
