If you're stuck for ideas, plenty of templates can be downloaded from online sites for you to trace around. The main thing is to keep it really simple. Cut out the designs on paper or card. Typical ornament designs include: Angel; snowman; star; Santa; reindeer; stocking. Example: You've chosen an angel. The template can be as simple as a circle for her head and a triangle for her body, with two triangles for wings. Your children can draw it for you."

Wearing heavy duty, pliable gloves is advisable when cutting and sanding. Then flatten the can to allow for the designs to be cut out."

If you have additional parts, these can be glued on, especially where it's too tricky to cut out the whole design but a lot easier to cut out basic shapes and glue them into formation. Heavy duty super glue will work best to bond the pieces."

  "text":" Decoration 1: Beer can seasonal cut outs Wash out the beer cans and allow to dry. Use as many cans as you wish to make ornaments. Depending on the size of the ornaments, you should get around 2-3 ornaments per can. Design the ornament shapes. Use graph paper and sketch out the holiday shapes to be used for ornaments. If you're stuck for ideas, plenty of templates can be downloaded from online sites for you to trace around. The main thing is to keep it really simple. Cut out the designs on paper or card. Typical ornament designs include: Angel; snowman; star; Santa; reindeer; stocking. Example: You've chosen an angel. The template can be as simple as a circle for her head and a triangle for her body, with two triangles for wings. Your children can draw it for you. Cut the cans open using tin snips (aka tinner's snips/aviation snips) or similar heavy duty cutters. Watch your fingers, as cut aluminum is sharp. If you want to remove splintered edges or sharp bits, it is possible to sand the edges but be careful while doing this. Wearing heavy duty, pliable gloves is advisable when cutting and sanding. Then flatten the can to allow for the designs to be cut out. Adhere the design template to one part of the aluminum sheet using poster tack or rolled up tape for temporary fixing. Then cut around the design using the tin snips and a sharp pair of scissors for the more tricky parts. If you have additional parts, these can be glued on, especially where it's too tricky to cut out the whole design but a lot easier to cut out basic shapes and glue them into formation. Heavy duty super glue will work best to bond the pieces. Hole punch or pierce a hole at the top of each ornament. Thread some string or ribbon through and tie a knot to create a hanger. Hang each ornament on the tree. If it looks great, make some more. Decoration 2: Santa and his sleigh Wash and let dry nine beer cans. Eight become the reindeer and one the sleigh, so if possible, make the sleigh can different from the reindeer cans. Assemble the reindeer cans. On each reindeer can, make a mark about a quarter way down from the top of each can. You will be creating a hole here through to the opposite side of the can and in the exact same place on each can, to enable a dowel rod to be passed through all of the cans to keep them together. Check that each mark is at the exact same height on every can. It helps to use the first can as the indicator. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/ce\\/Make-Beer-Can-Christmas-Ornaments-Step-8Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Make-Beer-Can-Christmas-Ornaments-Step-8Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/ce\\/Make-Beer-Can-Christmas-Ornaments-Step-8Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Make-Beer-Can-Christmas-Ornaments-Step-8Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":307,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":507.3626373626374,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/2.5\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Cut out a hole in each can at the mark.

Glue some cotton wool onto the can for Santa's seat. Then glue a Santa figurine onto the cotton wool. Behind Santa, glue on some gifts.

Check that it sits evenly\u2013\u2013you might need to make a few adjustments to the hanger piece. Jolly good. Decoration 3: Beer label love Pay homage to your favorite beer by making the beer label the whole point of the decoration. The great thing about this decoration is that you don\u2019t have to go all crafty in order to worship your favorite brewsky. All you\u2019ll need is a few can tops, some felt fabric and your favorite brew label. Cut out a large felt fabric circle. Consider using the same color fabric as your beer can; for example, if you're doing Pabst Blue Ribbon, go for royal blue felt fabric. Make the circle at least the same size as the bottom of a beer can, enough to hold the sticker proudly in the center. Carefully either cut out the label off your beer can or peel off the sticker from a beer bottle. Either way, make sure the logo is fully intact. Stick the label to the center of the felt. Use super glue for an aluminum label and a glue stick for a beer bottle paper label. Use the glue sparingly for the beer bottle label, to avoid any potential for bleeding through. Gather a dozen to a dozen and a half beer can tabs. Encircle the fabric circle with the tabs to create a circular border. Glue in place with super glue. Place the last tab at the top with the opening pointed upward. This tab will hold the ornament hook in place. Use super glue to hold it in place. Thread a piece of ribbon or string through the upward tab. Tie a firm knot to create the hanger. Hang the ornaments when fully dried.  Decoration 4: Beer can angel tree topper Wash and let dry the beer can.  Draw the shape of a dress, wings and head onto the can.  With great care, cut away all of the unmarked portion of the can, leaving the dress, wings and head design attached to the top and base of the can. Discard the cut out portion. Gently push the wings forward so that they are not still curving backward.  Cut out the base of the beer can to allow it to slip over the tree. This can be done using a can opener or the tin snips. It's up to you if you'd like to completely remove the top of the can or leave it as part of the final ornament. Experiment with what works best. A halo can be made by gluing on a golden or silver colored pipe cleaner shaped into a halo. Hang on top of the Christmas tree.If you don't want to cut out the shape in this way, another alternative is to use two beer cans. One can will form the body and head, the other will be cut to make wing shapes: Cut off the base of one of the cans. This will be the body of the angel and the open end is slipped onto the top of the tree. Draw two wing shapes on paper or card. Cut out the design to use as a template. Cut open one of the cans using tin snips. See Warnings below about sharpness. Flatten the can. Attach the templates with poster tack or similar. Cut around the wings. Discard the unused portion. Glue the wings to the back of the can, at the top portion.  Tilt the tab at the top upright. This becomes the \"head\" of the angel. Attach a golden pipe cleaner halo to the tab. Stick the angel at the top of the tree. Hang on top of the Christmas tree.  Decoration 5: Lazy person's beer ornaments Wash out the can before hanging on the tree. Use hot soapy water and a clean dishcloth to do the job. Carefully poke holes at the top sides of the can in order to receive the string. You can use either a pair of sharp scissors or a very sharp shish-kabob skewer. Thread a wire or string through the holes on the sides of the can. Be sure you have enough string to go through the can and then tie at the top. Attach a hook to the top of the string. Once you\u2019ve attached a Christmas ornament hook to the top of the string you will be ready for placement on the tree. Consider turning the can so you can see the label.",
