When growing garlic in Florida, buy softneck garlic to give your plant every chance to thrive. Some softneck varieties that grow well in Florida include Thermadrone, lorz Italian, Georgian Crystal, Creole, and Romanian Red garlic plants. You can buy softneck garlic heads at most plant nurseries. Buy 1 clove for every garlic plant you want in your garden, as each garlic plant will produce a single head."

If you plant your garlic during this time, you can expect a harvest around May or June. When planted in the fall, garlic plants stay dormant in the winter but will resume growing in spring. It will form roots but little-to-no top growth until around February. If you prefer, you can also plant your garlic in February or March for a late summer or autumn harvest. Garlic grown in the South, however, produces fuller harvests when planted in fall. Some hardneck varieties of garlic need to be chilled for 10-12 weeks before planting them in the spring. Softneck varieties of garlic do not need to be chilled are better suited to warm, humid climates"

To keep your soil chilled, find a spot in your garden with shade during the hottest part of the day. Growing garlic in temperatures hotter than 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) can stunt your plant's bulb growth, which makes using shade to chill the soil essential.
