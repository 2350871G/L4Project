Removing the gases and impurities is the first step to achieving clear ice; therefore pure, distilled water is needed. The second crucial step to achieving clear ice is the freezing method. In the freezer, a sphere will freeze from all sides to the center, this traps impurities/gases inside the ball and is another reason for the clearer ice."

In the freezer, a sphere will freeze from all sides to the center, this traps impurities/gases inside the ball and is another reason for the clearer ice. Get the silicone mold. It is simply a hollow silicon ball with a small hole, about a fingertip size, so you can fill it with water through it. And the mold can be broken into two halves in order to get the ice ball out after the water freezes. Build a square rack with popsicle sticks for freezing. Placing the mold on a rack in a freezer will freeze the water equally from all sides. Attach the wooden sticks to one another, using the wires and the craft glue. The rack should be suitable to hold the molds; they should NOT pass through it, but stay hung on it. Make sure to measure the length of the sticks comparing to the size of the pot and the molds to do this step accurately. The pictures shown will help you understand this part well. Hang the rack horizontally in the middle of the container using some wires. This will allow for the mold's fill-hole to be submerged under the water of the pot. Fill the pot with water.
