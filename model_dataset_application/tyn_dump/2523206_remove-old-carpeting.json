There's nothing expensive required, and everything should be available at any hardware store:\nHeavy duty leather gloves with a padded palm are essential to keeping you hands safe. You might encounter sharp nails or tacks while pulling up carpet, and a good pair of gloves will also help you grip the carpet. A dust-mask is also a good protective barrier to use, especially if you have asthma or other respiratory problems. To pry up the carpet and tacks, you'll need a pry bar, pliers, and a hammer. While you can start ripping the carpet up with your hands, getting it started and tearing it free will require some help. To keep the job clean, it's also good to have a roll of duct tape to roll up the carpet and move it after you've cut it loose, as well as a utility knife to cut strips of carpet."

This can actually be more time-intensive of a process than pulling the carpet up, which shouldn't take more than 45 minutes or an hour to remove with the right technique.

For the most part, carpet shouldn't be caught beneath the molding or the baseboard, because it's not usually installed that way.

Corners are the easiest places to work the carpet up, because you've got a nice little edge to grab onto. If the carpet is already coming up anywhere, start there. Sometimes carpet will start to peel at the edges, or pets will dig at it and make your job a whole lot easier. Start wherever makes your job the most convenient."

There will likely be carpet tacks that will be quite sticky, making it a lot easier to use the pry bar. Continue pulling and using the bar to separate the carpet from the floor as evenly as possible. Remove the carpet tacks as you find them. Look for tacks that might be attached to the bottom of the carpet. Use a pry bar and run it across the bottom of the carpet to ensure they come off before you roll it up."

To keep it clean, it's best to take off substantial, but manageable pieces at a time. A good eyeball estimate is no more than two or three feet deep, when the carpet is folded over. In other words, pull up six feet of carpet, times the width of the room. That'll be plenty heavy for you and a helper."

Even if it's a misshapen section of carpet, try to roll it up into a little bundle so it will be easier to carry. Use duct tape to secure the end of the roll, then have an assistant take one end and you take the other end, and discard the carpet. Eventually, you'll work through the entire carpet in this basic way. Pull up a section, cut it into a strip using a utility knife, and roll it up.

It'd be a shame to install $800 worth of new carpet over a squeaky floor, or a floor showing signs of mold. Walk around the sub-floor and bounce on it. Subfloor panels should be attached to the wood joists with screws or nails, and if you find some panels that squeak, you can secure it to the joist with ring shank nails. These are grooved nails with more secure gripping power, decreasing the chances that this squeaky area will ever squeak again. About two or three inches from the previous nail or screw, hammer in a shank nail and you'll be set. If your carpeting was damaged or wet, it might have impacted the subfloor.
