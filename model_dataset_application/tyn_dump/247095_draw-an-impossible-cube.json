  "text":" Parallelogram to impossible cube Draw a skinny, vertical parallelogram with the lower left corner open; from there, draw two lines going horizontally, shown in red.  Add two connecting lines on the right side of the parallelogram. They should form an \"L\". Add another two lines which continue from the corner of the parallelogram but pass beneath its right edge. The two lines then separate vertically, one going up and another going down to meet with the end of the \"L\". Draw a wide \"L\" that follows where the two previously drawn lines part ways.  Connect the bottom end of the wide \"L\" with the upper right-hand corner of the parallelogram by drawing a line that goes up and then left (forming a right angle) and passes underneath any lines it comes across.  Draw a line that begins by following the top of the parallelogram and then follows the horizontal part of the line drawn in the previous step, also passing underneath any lines it comes across.
