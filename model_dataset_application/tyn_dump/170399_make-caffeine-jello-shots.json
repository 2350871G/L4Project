To unmold and serve the shots, run a butter knife along the edges of each cavity and pop out the shots. Set them on a serving tray and offer them to your guests. Making Jello Shots Using Cola Combine some of the cola with the lime juice. Pour 1/2 cup (120 ml) of the chilled, caffeinated cola into a heat-proof mixing bowl.
