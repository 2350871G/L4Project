Every type of wok will work for your stir-frying, steaming, or frying needs, except Teflon, which should not be used for frying. The different materials of woks are:\nCast iron. This is the traditional material. This type of wok takes more time to heat up, but it cooks food evenly and retains heat longer. Iron is a solid choice, but it also has its drawbacks. Cast iron woks rust easily, so you will need to carefully dry it before and after use. It is also recommended to avoid cooking acidic food and greens in this type of wok. Aluminum wok. Iron woks are thick and heavy, but woks made of aluminum are light and thin. Aluminum is a great conductor of heat, but it does not retain heat very well. It is also not as durable as an iron wok. Teflon wok. A Teflon, or non-stick, wok is ideal for steaming, stewing, and boiling. Do not use this type of wok if you plan to deep fry or stir-fry food because the non-stick coating will come off into the food at high temperatures. Carbon steel. This is possibly the most recommended type of wok. It is typically the most inexpensive choice, and it is the most durable. A carbon steel wok also heats up quickly and evenly, and is almost a non-stick surface if cared for properly."
