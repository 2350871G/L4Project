  "text":" Protecting Your Floors and Walls Place a drop sheet under the wall you\u2019re cleaning. Get a plastic painter\u2019s drop sheet at your local home or hardware store. Arrange it so that it covers the floor under any wall you plan to sugar soap. Using a drop sheet can ensure that the sugar soap and any water won\u2019t ruin your floor. Move or cover furniture. Move any furniture near the wall to a place where no water or soap can splash it. If you can\u2019t move it, place a plastic drop sheet over the furniture to protect it from any splashes or spills. Tape over electrical outlets. Using masking tape or blue painter\u2019s tape, cover over any electrical outlets or sockets on the wall you\u2019re cleaning. Be sure to cover over any electrical outlets on the baseboards that may also get splashed. This can minimize the risk that any splashed or running water doesn\u2019t damage your outlets. Dust the wall. Using a duster or small broom, wipe off your wall. Removing dust from the wall can make it easier to sugar soap your walls. It can also ensure that you don\u2019t have any lingering dirty bits that won\u2019t go away. Remove marks with a baking soda paste. Mix together a paste of equal parts baking soda and water.

You can safely apply the baking soda paste to any paint color without it chipping or diluting the color. Cleaning with the Sugar Soap Put on your protective gear. Before you start using the sugar soap, put on a pair of eye goggles, rubber gloves, and a protective facemask. Wearing protective gear can ensure you don\u2019t get any sugar soap in your eyes or on your skin. Dilute the sugar soap. Fill a clean spray bottle with warm water. Then, add the amount of sugar soap indicated on the packaging instructions. Stir until the sugar soap is dissolved. Add more sugar soap to the warm water to deep clean your walls. Spray the sugar soap mixture onto your wall. Starting at the top of your wall, mist a small section with the sugar soap mixture. Let the sugar soap sit for 30-60 seconds. Then, wipe it off with a clean cloth or sponge. Leave the sugar soap on longer for areas that appear dirtier. Work your way down the rest of the wall. Continue to spray small sections of your wall with sugar soap until you reach the bottom. Concentrate the spray on the middle of your wall, as this is often the dirtiest part.
