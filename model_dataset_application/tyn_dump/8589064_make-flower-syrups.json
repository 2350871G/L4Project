If you plan on stockpiling the syrup, you can increase the amount by another cup or two.

The mixture should simmer for no less than thirty minutes, although you can leave it for as long as you like. The longer you allow the flowers to steep, the more potent the finished syrup will be. This will be the best time to incorporate any other ingredients you\u2019d like to include, such as vanilla, cinnamon, rosemary, cardamom, or citrus zest. To give your flower syrup a bolder color, stir in a very small amount of liquid food coloring. Coloration can create more exotic look and help you differentiate between multiple syrups."
