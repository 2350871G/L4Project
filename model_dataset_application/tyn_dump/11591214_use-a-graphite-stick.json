If you want to achieve a wide range of shades, get a pack of graphite sticks in different densities. When using graphite sticks, read the embossed letters on the side of the stick to determine how dark it is. The scale for graphite density can be a little confusing. 9H is the lightest shade while 9B is the darkest. The numbers go down from 9H until they hit F, HB, and B before going back up again. For reference, HB is considered the \u201cmiddle,\u201d and it\u2019s the same density as a #2 pencil."
