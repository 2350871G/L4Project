That\u2019s because this is the part that takes the longest to cook, so once it\u2019s reached a safe temperature, the rest of the meat should be cooked as well. In a whole chicken or turkey, for instance, the thickest part of the meat would be the breast or the thigh. Try to find a spot that\u2019s away from bone, fat, or gristle, as these could lead to an inaccurate reading.

If you're using a dial-style instant-read thermometer, or either a digital or dial-style leave-in thermometer, you'll need to push the probe at least 2 in (5.1 cm) into the food to get an accurate reading. Most digital instant-read thermometers only need to be inserted about \u20442 in (1.3 cm). Look for an indicator mark, like a small notch, on the probe. This will be how deep you need to push in the thermometer. Wait 15-20 seconds before reading an instant-read thermometer."

If the food hasn\u2019t reached the recommended minimum safe temperature, return it to the heat and let it cook for another 5 minutes or so, then check again. Food will often continue cooking once it's removed from the heat. If you're only a couple of degrees away, your food may come up to temperature while it's resting. Remove the food from the heat if it's ready.Tip: If you're using a leave-in thermometer, push it in another \u20442 in (1.3 cm) or so once it reaches the correct temperature.

Tip: If you don't have ice on hand, insert the thermometer into a pot of boiling water instead. The temperature should read 212 \u00b0F (100 \u00b0C) at sea level.
