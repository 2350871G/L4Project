  "text":" Removing the Old Blade Disconnect the edger from weed whacker and or power source. This step will ensure safety during this installation. Turn the edger on its side. The blade has a free rotation, and you must lock the spindle in order to remove the bolt. You can do this by locating the hole in the spindle which will lock the rotation. Insert a screwdriver into the spindle hole. Check to make sure the spindle is locked and there is no rotation. Attach the ratchet with \u00bd socket onto the spindle nut. To determine the direction to loosen the spindle nut, the spindle washer, located underneath the nut, will indicate the tightening direction. In this case, the direction to tighten is counter clock wise, so to loosen we will go clockwise. Switch the direction of the ratchet if needed. This is done by the control lever on the head of the ratchet. Switch ratchet to opposite mode (counter clockwise) to tighten the nut. Remove the spindle nut and washer. Lift the old blade off the spindle. The blade is normally dull, but do not take any chances and proceed with caution. The blade can be thrown away or recycled. Save the spindle nut and washer and keep in a safe place as we will use these with the new blade. Installing the New Blade Prepare the new blade for installation. The blades normally come in a pack of two. Use the box cutter to slice the packaging material. Carefully remove the blade you can save the label. This will help you identify for the blade next year. Inspect the spindle surface. Make sure there is no dirt or other debris that will prevent the new blade from seating properly over the hub. Position the new blade over the spindle hub. Make sure the whole blade seats properly on spindle. As long as the blade is over the hub, and centered, it is properly placed. Replace the spindle washer over the blade. Reminder: the direction to tighten spindle nut is on your spindle washer. Please note this direction for the next step. Place the spindle nut on top of the washer.
