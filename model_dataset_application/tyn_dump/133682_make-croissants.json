Warm the milk in a pan on the stove, or in 5-second intervals in the microwave. Place the flour, warm milk, yeast mixture and oil in a bowl, and mix together. You can use a stand mixer or mix the ingredients by hand with a spatula. Be sure the milk doesn't come to a boil when you warm it. If it does, start over with new milk."

          "description":"Place the dough into a clean bowl dusted with flour. The flour will make it easier to remove the dough from the bowl later. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel. Allow the dough to rise for one to two hours. When it's doubled in size, you'll be ready for the next step. You can snip an X into the top of the dough to help the dough rise a little more quickly. Cut an X that's about 2 inches (5 cm) wide in the middle of the dough. Place the dough in a warm area in your kitchen to help it rise faster."

          "headline":"Press the dough.",
          "description":"After the dough has doubled, gently remove it from the bowl and place it on a countertop lightly dusted with flour. Press the dough into an 8x12-inch rectangle (20x30 cm). Try to keep the edges as straight as possible. You can use your hands, or gently press down with a rolling pin."

Put it in the refrigerator for the last half-hour, since it needs to be chilled for the next step. If you'd like, you can allow the dough to rise overnight in the refrigerator. Just put it in the fridge, and it'll be ready to go in the morning."

Use a rolling pin to roll the butter between the sheets of wax paper, into a 12x6-inch rectangle (30x15cm). Pound the stick a few times with the rolling pin to flatten it, then roll it out quickly into the rectangle. Try to work fast so the butter won't get too warm. An important thing to keep in mind throughout this process is that you never want the butter to melt until you place it in the oven. Try to prevent it from ever getting warmer than room temperature. Place it back in the refrigerator when necessary. It helps to chill your hands and kitchen equipment so you don't warm up the butter. Wash your hands with cold water, and work with cooking instruments that have been chilling in the refrigerator. Make sure your kitchen isn't too warm, too."

Instead, you're rolling out the dough and the butter so that the layers are ultra thin. If the previous steps took you awhile and the butter was starting to look a little soft when you put it into the dough, consider chilling the dough for 15 to 20 minutes before rolling it out in this step.

Lightly butter the baking sheet you plan to use. Lay a piece of wax paper over a second baking sheet. Dust the countertop with flour. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and let it rest on the countertop for 10 minutes. Finally, roll the dough into a 20x5-inch rectangle (50x12 cm). Cut the dough lengthwise.

Put the baking sheet in the fridge to keep the butter chilled. Diagonally cut the remaining square of dough in half. You'll end up with two triangles, which will become your croissants. Roll a dough triangle into a croissant. Starting at the widest side, roll the dough upward to the top of the triangle. Form it into a crescent, and place it on the buttered baking sheet so that the top of the triangle is pinned to the sheet by the croissant. Repeat with the second dough triangle. Finish making croissants. Remove another dough square from the refrigerator. Repeat the cutting and rolling process. Continue removing squares from the refrigerator, cutting them into triangles, and rolling the triangles into croissants until you run out of dough. You should end up with 8 croissants on your buttered baking sheet. Let the croissants rise. Cover the baking sheet loosely with a clean dishtowel, and allow the croissants to rise for an hour. Baking the Croissants Preheat the oven to 475\u00b0F (240\u00b0C).  Make the egg wash. Break the egg into a small bowl, and use a fork to mix it up with 1 teaspoon of water. Brush the egg wash over the tops of the croissants.  Bake the croissants for 12 to 15 minutes. They should be golden brown on top when they're done. Serve the croissants. Remove the croissants from the oven, and let them cool for 10 minutes on a baking rack. Try to resist the urge to eat them immediately \u2014 they'll be hot!",
