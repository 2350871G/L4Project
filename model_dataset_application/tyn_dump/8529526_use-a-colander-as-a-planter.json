You will trim it down later. Use a pair of scissors to trim your landscape fabric into a circle. Set your colander upside on the landscape fabric. Draw a circle an inch or two bigger than the colander to cut out. The circle does not have to be perfectly round. If you can't find landscape fabric, set coffee filters inside the colander instead.

Adding Your Plant Add a small amount of potting soil. Get potting soil at a greenhouse and most department stores. Add a small amount of potting soil at first, just enough to secure the landscape fabric. Place your plant or seeds in the soil.

Hook all three chains together using the S-hook. Hang the colander where you want it. You can hang the colander off of a mantel or ceiling hook in your kitchen.
