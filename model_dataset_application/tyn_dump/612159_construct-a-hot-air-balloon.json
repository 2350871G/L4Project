Position the pipe cleaners on the inside about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edge. Fold the tissue over the pipe cleaners and glue it into place. If you don't have pipe cleaners, you can use wire. It should be at least 24 inches long (61 cm) and 16 gauge. You will also need wire cutters."

You may find more success in the morning, night, or during winter, depending on your location. Cold weather makes the difference in temperature more stark and thus more effective."
