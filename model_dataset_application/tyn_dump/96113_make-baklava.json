Assembling the Baklava Preheat the oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) and grease a baking pan. If you'd like thicker baklava, butter the inside of a 9 in \u00d7 13 in (23 cm \u00d7 33 cm) or 9 in \u00d7 12 in (23 cm \u00d7 30 cm) pan.

Melt 1 cup (226 g) of butter. Put the butter in a microwave-safe dish and microwave it for 20-second intervals until it melts. If you'd rather melt it on the stove, put the butter in a small saucepan and turn the burner to low. If you want lower-calorie baklava, replace half of the butter with vegetable oil.

Brush 8 sheets of phyllo with butter and lay them in the pan. Since this is the middle layer of baklava, it's fine to use up any torn or ripped sheets of phyllo. Try to brush butter between each of the 8 sheets as you stack them. Spread the remaining filling and 8 more sheets of phyllo in the pan. Scatter the other 1/2 of the spiced nut mixture evenly across the middle layer of phyllo. Then butter and layer 8 more sheets of phyllo to make the top of the baklava. Trim the edges and cut the baklava into small diamonds. Take a sharp knife and cut off any phyllo that's hanging over the side of the pan. Then cut 6 long strips that are 1 \u20444 inches (4.4 cm) wide through just the top layer of phyllo. Turn the pan so you can cut long diagonal slices across the top layer of pastry. This will create small diamonds that are about 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) wide. If you prefer, cut the baklava into small squares instead. If you're having trouble cutting cleanly through the phyllo, try using a serrated knife. Baking the Baklava Sprinkle the top of the baklava with water and bake it for 20 minutes.
