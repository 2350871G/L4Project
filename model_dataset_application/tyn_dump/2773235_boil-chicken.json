          "description":"If you'd like to boil a whole chicken, put it into a large stockpot that's at least 8 US quarts (7.6 L) in size. To boil pieces of chicken, put as many as you'd like to cook into a big pot so the pot is about 3/4 full. If you're making chicken for several people, plan on serving a couple of pieces for each person. For example, plan on boiling 1 thigh and 1 drumstick for each person you want to serve. 1 whole chicken will generally serve 4 to 6 people. You can use boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs to save time or boil bone-in chicken with the skin on for more flavor."

          "description":"The amount of liquid you need will depend on how much chicken you're boiling and the size of your pot. Although you can use water to boil the chicken, using vegetable or chicken stock will give your chicken a lot of flavor.Tip: Although you can cook chicken in red or white wine, you should poach the chicken at a lower temperature instead of boiling it. Boiling the chicken in wine can make the chicken tough and destroy the delicate flavors in the wine. Boiling in apple juice or apple cider is another great way to add subtle flavor to the chicken."

Then, rinse a few sprigs of fresh herbs that will complement the meal and add them directly to the pot without chopping them. You can add a handful of parsley, oregano, thyme, or bay, for every 3 or 4 pounds (1.4 or 1.8 kg) of chicken. For example, if you're using the boiled chicken to make a cold chicken salad, add fresh tarragon to the pot. Use a combination of herbs to give the chicken a greater depth of flavor."

For a large stockpot full of liquid, use around 1 tablespoon (15 g) of salt. Play around with adding any of these unique spices for 3 to 4 pounds (1.4 to 1.8 kg) of chicken:\n1 to 2 dried chilies\n1 teaspoon (3 g) of whole peppercorns\nA 1 inch (2.5 cm) piece of fresh ginger\n1 teaspoon (2 g) of cumin\n1 teaspoon (2 g) of paprika"
