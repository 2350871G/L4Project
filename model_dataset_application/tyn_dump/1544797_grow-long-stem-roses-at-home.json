    "Purchase a fertilizer formulated specifically for roses from a nursery or garden center.",
    "Read the directions carefully to use your fertilizer.",

    "In addition, you can purchase liquid fertilizer and mix it with your water.",
    "Cover your topsoil in a 2\u20134 in (5.1\u201310.2 cm) layer of mulch.",
    "Mulch helps reduce stress on the plant, conserve water, and encourage healthy growth.",
    "Scoop mulch with your garden tool or shovel and place it on top of your soil.",
    "Continue spreading mulch until you have at least a 2 in (5.1 cm) layer.",
    "Leave about 1 in (2.5 cm) between the base of the stem and the mulch.",
    "If you planted your roses in containers, adding mulch is optional.",
    "It helps them grow, but you may not have room in your pot for 2 in (5.1 cm).",
    "Some is better than none!",
    "Water your roses thoroughly immediately after you plant them.",
    "Grab your gardening hose, and place it at the base of your rose bush.",
    "Water your roses for about a minute so they are thoroughly saturated.",
    "Watering your flowers right after you plant them helps the roots take to the new soil.",
    "Caring for Your Roses Water your roses diligently at least every 2 days.",
    "Roses require ample water to grow large, gorgeous flowers.",
    "Soak all of the roots about 1 minute at least 2 times a week in warm weather.",
    "You want to take your time watering the roses so the water reaches entirely to the roots, rather than just the surface.",
    "To check how wet your soil is, simply stick your finger all the way into the soil.",
    "If it is dry, you should water your roses.",
    "Generally, aim to give the roses a total of 3 in (7.6 cm) of water every week.",
    "Mist the buds with a light coating of water every 2-4 days.",
    "In addition to regular watering, you can spray your rose blooms with a squirt bottle once your flowers emerge.",
    "This helps keep them clean and moisturize the petals.",
    "Apply a fresh layer of organic fertilizer once every 4 weeks.",
    "Roses use nutrients in the soil very quickly as they grow their flowers.",
    "In particular, their primary nutrients include nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.",
    "To keep them well fed, spread a 1 in (2.5 cm) layer of fertilizer over their topsoil about once a month.",
    "You can purchase fertilizer at garden centers and home supply stores.",
    "Alternatively, you can use compost to feed your roses.",
    "Trim your roses regularly to remove leaves, stems, and additional buds.",
    "When growing long stem roses, you want each plant to grow 1 large, luscious flower.",
    "Once your roses grow to about 18\u201324 in (46\u201361 cm), trim away any extra leaves and shoots from the main base stem using garden shears.",
    "In addition, go around the stem and look for any small green buds.",
    "When you find the buds, snip them off at the stem using your shears.",
    "Removing the additional leaves, stems, and buds helps the plant direct all its nutrients to the main bud.",
    "Cut your roses when they reach 18\u201324 in (46\u201361 cm).",
    "If you want to cut your  long stem flowers to display in a bouquet or a vase, trim your roses when they grow to about 18 in (46 cm) or longer.",
    "This is the length of your standard long stem rose.",
    "Trim off the extra leaves and buds with garden shears, then cut the rose about 18 in (46 cm) away from the flower.",
    "Make your cut at a 45-degree angle directly above another bud to effectively prune the flower.",
    "If you want extra-long stems, let your rose continue to grow beyond 24 in (61 cm)"
