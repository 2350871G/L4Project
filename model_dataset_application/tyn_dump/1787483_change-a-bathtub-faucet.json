Turn on one of the handles in your bathtub so the water empties out of the spout. There will be a small amount of water leftover from your pipes that will drain. When the water stops coming out of the spout, turn the faucet off again. Pry the index from the stem with the end of a screwdriver. The index is in the middle of your handle and is usually a coin-sized plastic cover. Slide the end of a flathead screwdriver under the edge of the index and pry it out. The size of your index will vary depending on the handles you have.Tip: Cover the tub drain while you remove the index so it doesn\u2019t accidentally fall in. Loosen the screw inside the handle to remove it. After you pop off the index cover, you should see a screw inside the opening.
