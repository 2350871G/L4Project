Chad Zani\t\t\tAuto Detailing Expert\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: You need to thoroughly prepare the area before you add any touch-up paint or the result might look bad. Remove all the wax and sealant on the area and make sure any dirt and grime are gone as well. Without prepping the spot first, the paint won't adhere well, and it could look 'globby.'"

Touch up paint comes in several types of containers. It often comes in small jars of the paint or in paint pens. It's important to get an exact match to your car's color, so don't settle on a color that is just close to your car's. Light-colored cars can be difficult to find a perfect color match.
