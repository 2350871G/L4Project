If you prefer, you can also buy whole shrimp and peel them yourself later. Either way, all you\u2019ll have to do to get them ready for the pot, oven, or skillet is thaw them out. While shopping for frozen shrimp, check each package for a symbol reading \u201cIQF,\u201d which stands for \u201cIndividually Quick Frozen.\u201d This means each shrimp has been frozen separately, which reduces clumping and improves flavor and texture. It\u2019s important that your shrimp be deveined. It\u2019s practically impossible to devein shrimp while they\u2019re still frozen or after they\u2019ve been cooked, and it will take much longer if you wait until after they\u2019ve thawed."

To ensure that your shrimp defrost as quickly as possible, be sure to break up any large chunks that have frozen together. If you don\u2019t have a colander or strainer, try leaving the bag sealed and running some cool water over it in the sink to thaw it. It\u2019s time-consuming, but it will get the job done.

Allow the shrimp to sit for 10-15 minutes, or until the last of the ice has melted. To speed up the thawing process, leave a small stream of fresh water trickling into the bowl to continually replace the water that\u2019s grown cold.Warning: Never use warm water to defrost frozen shrimp.

To save yourself some time, let your tap run until it\u2019s as hot as it can get before you begin filling your pot to increase the starting temperature of your water.

Stir your shrimp periodically as they boil to make sure they all heat evenly. There's no need to wait for all of your shrimp to float.

If you\u2019re making shrimp cocktail or plan on reheating your shrimp later, plunge them into an ice bath for a few seconds, then drain them again. This will prevent them from overcooking accidentally. For maximum flavor, serve your boiled shrimp hot with melted butter and a dash of Old Bay Seasoning.
