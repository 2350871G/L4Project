The front of the roof is on the same side as the opening. Adding Rooms, Windows, and Doors Cut the rest of the lid apart to make the second floor. Stand the house up on what's left of the lid. Trace around the bottom of the house with a pen, pencil, or marker, then lift the house away. Cut the resulting rectangle out with scissors or a craft blade. Try to include at least 2 of the walls from the lid. These will create tabs that will make it easier to install the floor. If the leftover lid is not big enough, use another sheet of cardboard. Cereal boxes work great for this. Tape or glue the dividing floor into the middle of the shoe box. Insert the rectangle floor into the shoe box. Make sure that the top and bottom floors are about the same height, then tape or glue the 2 tabs from the dividing floor to the box. Use a strip of tape to secure the other end of the floor to the box. If you did not leave any tabs, place strips of tape along 2 of the narrow edges and 1 of the long edges, then slide the floor into the box. Press the tape strips against the walls. Use extra cardboard to make extra walls, if desired. Draw a rectangle on a sheet of cardboard based on the height and depth of the room. Cut the rectangle out, then add a strip of tape to the top, bottom, and side edges. Slide the room divider into the room, then press the tape strips against the floor, ceiling, and back wall. The height of the rectangle should match the height of the room. The width of the rectangle should match the depth of the box. Don't do more than 1 room divider per floor, otherwise the rooms will be too narrow. Draw window and door shapes, as desired. It would be best to draw these on the inside of the box, because then you can be sure that the floor and room dividers won't get in the way.
