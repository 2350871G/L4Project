Each brand is different, so read the temperature specified on the bottle. Create your template. You do not absolutely have to create a template, but it will make it easier to create your design.

Liquid polymer clay comes in limited colors: clear, gold, and silver. That's not a lot, and it may not work for every design out there. You can always paint it afterwards, or you can tint it first. Keep in mind that most brands will appear opaque at first, and will eventually turn clear after you finish baking them. Pour some liquid polymer clay into a little dish.

If you don't have a funnel small enough, roll some wax paper into a cone, and stick it into the neck of the bottle. Use that as a funnel instead. Creating Your Design Place a sheet of heat-safe glass over your template. The key to making liquid clay work as window clings is to cure it on top of a smooth surface. Your sheet of glass needs to be perfectly smooth, without scratches, texture, bumps, or dents. If you are not using a template, you can work on top of a smooth, glazed tile.

If you are applying it straight from the bottle, use the tip of the applicator to blend in the seams. If you are using a paintbrush, use the tip of the brush to blend everything together. Transfer the glass to a baking sheet. Carefully lift the glass or tile you are working on and place it onto a baking sheet. Bake the design in the preheated oven. Again, each brand will have a slightly different baking time. Read the label on your bottle of liquid polymer clay.

Once the time is up, use a pair of oven mitts to take the baking sheet out of the oven. Set the baking sheet down onto a heat-safe surface, and let everything cool down completely. Do not get impatient and try to run the glass under cold water; it will shatter. Finishing the Window Cling Peel the template off. You can do it with your fingers or with a metal palette knife. Be careful not to rip or tear the window cling. If you are using a palette knife, slide it carefully under the window cling to pry it off. Clean it up. Because the window cling is handmade, it will have some imperfections, such as bumps or strands. If these bother you, cut them off with a small pair of scissors or a craft blade.
