You can use a 9-inch by 9-inch (23-cm by 23-cm) pan for the brownies, but don\u2019t go any larger than that. You\u2019ll likely wind up with brownies that are thin and overcooked.

Use some softened butter to grease the sides of the pan that aren\u2019t covered by the paper. You can use non-stick cooking spray instead of butter if you prefer. If you don\u2019t have parchment paper or foil on hand, you can also butter the entire baking pan, including the bottom and sides, to keep the brownies from sticking."
