You can make cutouts in the insulation for anything on the inside of the garage door, such as a handle or a lock. Hold the insulation over the handle or lock and draw a rough outline where you need to make a cutout. Use your utility knife to cut away the insulation inside the outline you drew. You should wear gloves when you handle and cut insulation to avoid getting fiberglass slivers."

Most insulation kits are designed to cover a garage door that is 9 ft (2.7 m) wide. If your garage door is bigger, then you will need additional kits to fully insulate it. You should check the balance of your garage door after you insulate it because insulation adds weight. Open it halfway and then stop it and let it hang. It should stay in place without dropping if it is balanced. If the door falls when you let go of it halfway, then hire a garage door mechanic to adjust the spring tension."

Trim any pieces to fit with a utility knife and a ruler if there is extra space at the top or non-standard spacing between studs.Batt insulation is the standard cotton-fiberglass insulation used in housing and it is already cut to fit between standard framework studs. Batt insulation comes in compressed packaging. Make sure you clear enough space in your garage so that when you open the packages you have room to work. For walls connected to other rooms in your home, install the batt insulation with the paper side backward facing the connected room. The paper side should always go towards the space that you are trying to insulate most, so in this case, the room inside your home takes priority over the garage. For walls that are not connected, install the insulation with the paper side facing inwards towards the garage. Standard studs are placed every 16 in (41 cm) in the framework of housing."
