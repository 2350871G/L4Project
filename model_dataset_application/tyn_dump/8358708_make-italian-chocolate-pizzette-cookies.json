Set the temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat. Pay attention to your oven so you know when it\u2019s reached the right temperature. In most cases, it will flash a light or beep to alert you. Combine the flour, chocolate chips, almonds, and baking powder. Add 1 \u00bd cups (360 g) of all-purpose flour, 4 ounces (115 g) of bittersweet chocolate chips, \u00be cup (82 g) of finely chopped roasted almonds, and 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking powder to a medium bowl.

When all of the wet ingredients are mixed, slowly add the dry ingredients to the bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon until the dry ingredients are just combined. Be careful not to overmix the dough. You can wind up with tough cookies. Shaping the Cookies Break off a piece of the dough and roll into a rope. When the dough is fully mixed, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Tear off a small piece of the dough, and roll it out with your hands into a rope that\u2019s approximately 1 \u00bd-inches (4-cm) thick. If you find that the dough is sticking to your hands, rub a small amount of canola or vegetable oil over them before rolling out the dough. Flatten the rope slightly. When you\u2019re shaped the dough into a rope, use your hands to gently press down on it. You want to flatten the rope so it\u2019s approximately 2-inches wide (5-cm). Slice the rope into cookies. After you\u2019ve flattened the rope, use a knife to cut it into pieces that are approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) wide. Slice the cookies on an angle to give them a more decorative look. You can also use a pizza cutter to slice the cookies if you prefer. Repeat the process with all of the dough. When you\u2019ve finished slicing the first rope into cookies, break off another piece of dough and repeat the entire process. Keep repeating until you\u2019ve used up all of the dough. Baking the Cookies Transfer the cookies to a lined baking sheet. Once you\u2019ve rolled and sliced all of the dough, line a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper. Place the cookies on the sheet so they\u2019re approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) apart to prevent them from spreading into one another as they bake. You can substitute a silicone baking mat for the parchment paper if you prefer. Bake the cookies until they are firm around the edges. Place the cookies in the preheated oven. Allow them to bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the edges are firm but the center is still soft. The cookies should have a moist, fudgy center similar to a brownie when they\u2019re finished baking. Allow the cookies to cool. After you take the cookies out of the oven, transfer them to a wire cooling rack. Let the cookies cool for 15 to 20 minutes.

Place the bowl over a large saucepan with barely simmering water on medium to medium-low heat on the stove. Stir the mixture constantly until the chocolate is completely smooth.
