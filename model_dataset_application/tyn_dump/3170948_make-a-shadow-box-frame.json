Use a ruler or a tape measure to find the length and width of the item so you can make a shadow box frame that fits it. Write down your measurements so you can easily remember them. For example, you could have a painting that measures 18 by 24 inches (46 by 61 cm) that you want to install inside of a shadow box frame. If you\u2019re giving the shadow box as a gift, or you don\u2019t know the dimensions of the artwork, choose a common shadow box measurement such as 10 by 10 inches (25 by 25 cm), 11 by 14 inches (28 by 36 cm), or 12 by 12 inches (30 by 30 cm)."

    "Dip a paintbrush into the paint and use smooth, consistent strokes to apply a thin layer of paint to the wood.",
    "Paint the inside, the backing, and 3 of the sides.",
    "When the paint dries, paint the last side so you don\u2019t create smudges by holding the frame to paint it.",
    "Work to apply an even layer of paint.",
    "Be sure to paint the corners and edges of the frame as well.",
    "Allow the paint to dry for at least 1 hour.",
    "Drying times can vary based on the type of paint you\u2019re using as well as the temperature and humidity of the room you\u2019re working in, but you need to wait at least an hour to allow the first coat of paint to dry.",
    "Test to see that it\u2019s dry by touching the paint with your finger.",
    "Check the packaging on the paint for specific drying times.",
    "Work in a well-ventilated room to avoid breathing in the paint fumes and aim a fan at the frame to speed up the drying time of the paint.",
    "Apply a second coat of paint for better coverage.",
    "You may notice spots where you can see the wood through the coat of paint, so apply a second coat using the same smooth strokes to create an even and consistent finish.",
    "Allow the second coat to dry completely.",
    "If necessary, you can apply an additional coat of paint to the frame.",
    "Adding a Front Panel Use a picture frame with glass that matches your dimensions.",
    "A simple way to add a front panel to your shadow box is to connect a wooden picture frame that already has the glass connected to it.",
    "Choose a frame that fits the dimensions of your shadow box so it fits onto it evenly.",
    "Remove any backing or other materials from the picture frame so that only the front wooden frame and the glass remains.",
    "You can buy new frames at craft supply stores and department stores.",
    "Look for old picture frames at thrift stores that you can upcycle for your project!Tip: If you don\u2019t have a picture frame with glass, glue a sheet of glass to a simple frame design.",
    "Drill 2 hinges onto the inside of the picture frame.",
    "Flip the picture frame over so the back is facing up.",
    "Use a power drill to attach a small hinge to the outermost edge of one of the sides of the frame near the top.",
    "Then, attach another small hinge to the outermost edge of the frame near the bottom so there are 2 hinges on the same side.",
    "Make sure the hinges are aligned with each other and evenly spaced from the top and bottom edges of the frame.",
    "Use the small screws that come with the hinges.",
    "You can find small hinges at home improvement stores, department stores, and online.",
    "Screw the hinges to the front edge of the shadow box frame.",
    "Lay the picture frame on your shadow box frame and align the hinges so they lay flat on the outer edge on the front.",
    "Use your drill to drive the screws into the shadow box frame so the hinges connect the picture frame to it.",
    "Open and close the front panel to make sure it works and the edges are lined up evenly.",
    "You can also use a screwdriver if you don\u2019t have access to a power drill.",
    "Paint the front panel to match the rest of the frame.",
    "Use the same paint or stain that you used to paint the rest of the shadow box frame and apply a thin coat over the front panel.",
    "Allow the paint to dry completely and then add a second coat so none of the original paint or color is visible.",
    "Use as many coats as it takes to cover the panel without any of the original paint visible."
