Set the screws aside and swing the hinge plate away so it\u2019s not covering the loose holes.Tip: This method works best for hinges that are attached to a thick, solid piece of wood, such as a solid wooden door or door frame. If you are fixing just a few loose screw holes for something that has multiple hinges, like a door, you can put a wedge underneath it to support it while you unscrew the loose hinge and fix the stripped holes. If all the hinges have loose screws, it will be easier to just completely remove the door. If there is paint over the hinge, you can slice around it carefully with a utility knife or box cutter to free it so you can swing the plate away."

Screw the hinge back into place after the glue is dry. The extra wood from the matches or toothpicks helps the screws fit tightly into the stripped holes. You can use multiple matches or toothpicks in each hole if you need to fill the hole more. Make sure to snap off the match heads if you use wooden matches.

Plastic, cone-shaped wood anchors work best because they fit into stripped holes of any diameter with no drilling required.
