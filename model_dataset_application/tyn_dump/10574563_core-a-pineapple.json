  "text":" Slicing the Pineapple in Quarters to Core It Cut the top and bottom off your pineapple. Lay the pineapple on its side. With a very sharp knife, slice off the top of the pineapple about 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) into the brown part. Toss the leaves and top of the pineapple. Turn the pineapple around, and slice off the bottom the same way. Grasp the pineapple while you're cutting so it doesn't slide around on the board, and make sure to get your fingers out of the way! Place the pineapple on one of its flat ends to cut off the skin. Use one of the cut sides as a base, and then slice down the edges of the pineapple to chop off the skin. Keep turning the pineapple, slicing a strip of skin each time you turn. Try not to cut too much of the fruit off with the skin. Cut the pineapple into quarters. Moving from top to bottom, slice the pineapple in half lengthwise. Cut each half in half again, also lengthwise, until you are left with 4 quarters. Remove the core by cutting along the inside of each slice. The core is in the very center, so cut along the inside of each slice. As you cut off the inside edge, you'll get a triangle shape. Move from top to bottom to cut it all out. You can toss the core or save it for other uses. Coring a Pineapple Half with the Skin Still On Chop off the top and bottom of the pineapple. With the pineapple on its side, slice off the top of the pineapple where the leaves are, coming about 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) into the main part of the pineapple.

As you do, apply light pressure downward so that the corer continues to move through the fruit. Keep going until you hit the bottom. If your corer tries to move off center, gently redirect it back to the middle. Take the pineapple out of the skin by lifting out the corer and slices. Pull upwards on the handle while holding on to the fruit with your other hand. The corer will bring out the core and the sliced pineapple all in one go. Release the core and the slices by taking off the handle. The handle of the corer should have 2 small buttons. Push the buttons at the same time to pop the handle out.

You can slice down one side of the pineapple slices from top to bottom to make rings, as it comes out of the corer in one, long curlycue. Coring Individual Slices Slice off the top and base of the pineapple. Turn the pineapple on its side, and cut off the crown about 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) into the fruit part. Flip the pineapple around and cut off the base, as well. Use a sharp chef's knife to slice it. Cut off the skin in long strips. Place the pineapple on one of its flat sides. Cut from top to bottom along the outer edge, slicing off the skin in strips. Turn the pineapple and keep cutting off strips as you turn. If any eyes are left in the pineapple, use the tip of your knife to dig them out. Slice the pineapple into coins. Turn the pineapple on its side. Cut the fruit into thin coins by slicing into the side of the pineapple. Each one should be about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) wide or slightly less. Take the core out with a knife or icing tip. Look for the round circle in the middle of the coins you just made, which is the core. Run the knife tip around the core and then push it out with your finger. You can also use a wide icing tip or a very small, round cookie cutter to cut the center out.",
