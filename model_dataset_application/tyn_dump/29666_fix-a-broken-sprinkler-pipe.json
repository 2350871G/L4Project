Dig up the dirt above the bad pipe with a shovel (you will probably also need a hand trowel to dig up the dirt under the pipe). You will want to have at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) on each side of the break clear and enough room for you fist underneath the pipe. If the hole fills with water, you will either have to wait for it to dry or bail it out (the latter is recommended)."
