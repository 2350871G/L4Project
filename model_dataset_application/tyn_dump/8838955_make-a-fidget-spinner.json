To keep the stencil in place, try pushing a toothpick through the center of it and slightly into the cardboard. The cardboard or foam board you choose should be less than \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick.

Go around the edges with a pair of scissors to trim away any bumps and make your base as round as possible. If you're using scissors, it might be easier to cut a square or rectangle around your spinner first. That way you can cut away the extra board from the shape of your spinner, rather than cutting the spinner out. Always be careful when working with sharp scissors or craft knives! Cut away from your hands and work slowly so you don't hurt yourself. You may want to glue printer paper or colored paper to the front and back of your spinner base."

You can find the exact center of a 2-prong spinner by measuring the length and width and dividing each by 2. On a spinner with an uneven number of prongs or an irregular shape, draw a straight line through each prong towards the center. The area where they meet is the middle.

The circles should be on either side of the base, stuck on the toothpick, and a tiny bit away from touching the spinner base. The circles being slightly off center on the toothpick won't change the balance of your spinner too much, but it might make it look slightly off balance if your circles are in different places.
