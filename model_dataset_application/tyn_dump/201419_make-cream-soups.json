If you don\u2019t want to use milk, substitute it for the same amount of either chicken or vegetable broth. You could also do a half-and-half mixture of milk and broth.

Also, add 3/4 teaspoon (4 grams ) of salt, 3/4 teaspoon (1.5 grams) of black pepper, and 3/4 teaspoon (1.5 grams) of minced garlic to the pot at this time. For example, if you\u2019re making cream of broccoli and mushroom soup, add 2 cups (400 grams) of chopped broccoli and 1 cup (200 grams) of diced mushrooms to the pot.

Stir the soup occasionally to keep it from burning on the bottom. If your soup still seems runny after the 5 minutes of boiling, add some cornstarch to it. Mix 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of cold water and 1 tablespoon (9 grams) of cornstarch together first in a small bowl, and then add that to the soup.
