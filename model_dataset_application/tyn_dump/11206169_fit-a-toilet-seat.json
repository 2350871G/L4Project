In this case, use a tape measure to determine the maximum length and width of the seat. Also measure the spacing between the bolts that hold the seat in place (located in the hinges at the back of the seat), and record the distance between the bolts and the toilet tank. Use these measurements when shopping for attachments. Some accessories may instead attach to the mounting bolts, in which case the bolt spacing measurement is of particular importance."

Do the following to remove the seat:\nLift the plastic caps at the back of the seat to expose the heads of the bolts. This is unnecessary if the heads are already visible. Use pliers to loosen the nuts that secure the bolts to the underside of the bowl. If the head of the bolt spins when you do this, insert a screwdriver into the bolt head with your other hand to hold it still. Lift away the seat once you've removed the nuts. Keep the nuts in case you lose one of the nuts that come with the new toilet seat. If the bolts aren't permanently attached to the seat hinges, keep them just in case as well."

In this case, shop for a round seat that fits your length measurement.

In the U.S., elongated seats nearly always have a length of between 18\u201319 \u20442 in (46\u201350 cm). The length, though, will remain in the 16\u201317 in (41\u201343 cm) range. Use the length measurement to identify the right elongated seat for your toilet. If you have an elongated bowl that is outside these typical parameters (in the U.S.), you'll probably have to special order a seat from the toilet manufacturer. As with round seats, make sure the bolt spacing measurement for your chosen elongated seat matches the spacing on your toilet. Choose a European toilet seat based both on shape and measurement. While most U.S. toilet seats are either round or elongated, European bowls often have either rounded, pointed, or D-shaped seats. The length is nearly always about 17 in (43 cm), so shop based on shape if your bowl length is at or close to this measurement. It's usually easy to visually differentiate between D-shaped, rounded, and pointed seats. You may want to take your old seat with you just to be sure, though.

You may, for example, need to search online for \u201ctoilet seat with 8 in (20 cm) bolt spread.\u201d\nYou can often find your toilet's make and model stamped on the underside of the tank lid. Otherwise, you may need to empty the tank and look for this information somewhere on the inner walls. Installing the New Seat Center the seat on the bowl rim with the bolts in the correct openings. Feed the 2 bolts that are attached to the hinge of the seat into the holes at the back of the bowl. Then, lay the seat onto the rim and make sure it is evenly spaced on top of the rim on all sides. For instance, if the seat overhangs the outer edge of the rim on the left side by about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) and is the same distance short of the rim's outer edge on the right side, you'll want to slide the toilet to the right until the spacing is roughly even.
