          "description":"To make a homemade stain from natural ingredients, you'll combine the vinegar with a steel wool scouring pad. Any type of vinegar will work, as long as it's been properly distilled. White, balsamic, and apple cider vinegar are just a few of the varieties you have to choose from. Each type of vinegar will produce a slightly different color when it interacts with the steel, and with the wood you're staining. Play around with different combinations until you end up with a tone you like. White vinegar tends to create a rich reddish hue, while balsamic and apple cider vinegar most often result in deep, muted brown or black shades."

          "description":"Ideally, you should use an open container, or one with a removable lid. Once you've picked out a suitable container, pour in the vinegar slowly to avoid spills. A glass jar, large mixing bowl, or plastic bucket could all make good containers, depending on how much all-natural stain you intend to make. If you decide to use a metal container, make sure it's made from nonreactive materials. Otherwise, it may react with the vinegar and throw off the color of the stain."
        },
        {
          "headline":"Add a steel wool scouring pad to the vinegar.",
          "description":"A good rule of thumb is to use 1 steel wool pad for every 1.5 cups (0.35 L) of vinegar in your container. This will produce enough stain to color small pieces of furniture and accessories. If you're attempting to distress a larger item, multiply the recipe by 2 or 3 to make sure you'll have enough. Pulling the steel wool apart gently will increase its surface area and help it dissolve faster in the vinegar. Be sure to wear a pair of thick work gloves to protect your hands while handling the steel wool. To double the amount of stain, mix up 3 cups (0.71 L) and 2 steel wool pads. To triple it, use 4.5 cups (1.1 L) and 3 pads."

          "description":"Place a lid lightly over the mouth of the container. This will keep the stench of vinegar from becoming overpowering without preventing air from finding its way into the container. If your mixing container doesn't have a lid, try draping a coffee filter or paper towel over the opening and securing it with a rubber band. Letting some air into the container is important, as oxygen is required to kick off the chemical reaction that causes the steel wool to rust and discolor the vinegar."

          "headline":"Allow the solution to sit overnight.",
          "description":"As the steel wool dissolves in the vinegar, it will gradually oxidize and turn darker and darker. After about 24 hours, your homemade stain will be concentrated enough to change the complexion of light-colored woods like pine, cedar, and spruce. If you're happy with the color of the stain after the first 24 hours, remove the steel wool to keep it from getting any more concentrated. If you want your stain to be even darker, leave the steel wool in the vinegar solution longer. Keep in mind, however, that it will stop changing color after about 2 days."

Once it's had time to cool, brush it onto the surface of the wood you'll be staining, then let it dry completely. You won't see much of a difference right away, but a quick once-over will help the stain take hold.

For the most natural looking results, use no more than \u20444 cup (59 mL) of beet juice for every 1.5 cups (0.35 L) of stain. The more beet juice you add, the more colorful the stain will be, so start with a conservative amount. Otherwise, the finish could come out looking artificial.

Simply whisk powdered turmeric together with a little water and use a cloth or sponge to wipe it onto the wood. The effect will be a quaintly faded patina with a warm, golden base. You can either stain directly over the turmeric or apply it on top of the vinegar stain. Just make sure one substance has had ample time to dry before layering on the other. Turmeric stains are notoriously difficult to get out of woods, fabrics, and even kitchen counters, so be careful not to let the mixture drip onto any nearby surfaces."

Staining the Wood Put down newspaper to safeguard your work area from unwanted messes. Since you'll be making use of substances that stain easily, it's a good idea to have a protective layer or two in place. You can also stretch out a plastic tarp or grab a few pieces scrap cardboard if you don't have a newspaper handy. If you're working with a large quantity of stain and you're worried about spills, splatters, or lingering smells, consider setting up your materials outside. Apply the stain directly to the wood.
