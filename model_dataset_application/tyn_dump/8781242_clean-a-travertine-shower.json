Use a non-acidic stone cleaner, such as Granite Gold Shower Cleaner or MB-3, and spray the travertine thoroughly from the top to the bottom. Let the cleaner sit on the stone for 10 minutes to begin dissolving any soap scum. Given travertine\u2019s acid sensitivity, always avoid applying vinegars or other citrus cleaners."

This way, dirty water will run down on tiles you\u2019ve yet to clean. Focus particular attention on any surface holes in the travertine when cleaning, as they can collect soap scum.
