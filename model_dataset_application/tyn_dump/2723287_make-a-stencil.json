Check your printer manual beforehand if you aren\u2019t sure what type of printer you have or what types of paper or material are compatible with it. Never put vinyl in a laser printer. Because of its high temperature, it can melt the vinyl or distort the stencil. If you have a laser printer, print your design onto a sheet of regular paper. Then trace it onto the vinyl with a permanent marker. Tips for Choosing a Stencil Design\nIf you\u2019re a beginner, opt for a design without a lot of intricate cutouts or curved edges. Straight lines and simple shapes are easier to cut. For a completely custom design, draw it yourself. Design your print directly on the vinyl, or draw it on a piece of paper first and transfer it. If you want an oversized print, have it printed at a local printing shop or office store instead of trying to piece it together from your own printer."

To hold the stencil in place, you can tape it to the mat or ask someone to hold it for you while you cut. You can also use a stencil cutter or vinyl cutter if you have one. Set aside any of the inside sections that you\u2019ll need later to create your design. For example, if you're cutting out a donut, keep the piece that you cut out of the inside. Otherwise, you'll end up with a filled-in circle instead of a donut."

If it shifts at all, it will ruin the end result, so place tape on the outside edges of the stencil. Use appropriate tape for whatever surface you\u2019re painting. For example, if you\u2019re stenciling a painted wall, use painter\u2019s tape so it doesn\u2019t damage the paint that\u2019s already there."

Wait for the paint to dry before applying the next coat so you don\u2019t smear the previous coat. Be careful not to brush or roll too vigorously. You don\u2019t want to shift the stencil or push paint under the edges. Choose your paint type based on the surface you're stenciling. For example, if you're decorating a wall, use interior wall paint or, if you're designing on ceramic, opt for acrylic paint. Spray paint is also a quick and easy option for stenciling."
