Place the skillet on the burner with the butter in the pan, and turn on the burner to heat the butter. If your pan isn't non-stick, such as a carbon steel pan, you may need to spray it lightly with a non-stick spray before adding the butter."

Make sure the butter is covering almost as much of the surface of the bottom of the pan as possible. If you don't have butter, you can use lard, olive oil, or bacon fat to make your eggs, because each will spread to coat the bottom of the pan."

          "description":"Once the butter is simmering, hold the egg about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) over the frying pan as you break it, and let it gently drop into the bottom of the hot pan. The egg whites will begin to cook immediately. If you have trouble cracking eggs, crack each one into a bowl, check for shell fragments, and then carefully pour the egg into the pan. Identifying a Fresh Egg\nIf you're not sure how old the eggs in your refrigerator are, fill a glass with water and gently place the egg in the water. If the egg sinks to the bottom, it's very fresh and can be used for all recipes. If it's submerged at the top of the water with the wide end sticking up, it's slightly older. It's still safe to fry or hard boil older eggs, as long as they're cooked all the way through. If the egg floats on top of the water, it's expired and should be thrown away."

After 2 minutes, open the lid and check the whites to make sure they're cooked on the top. If not, recover the pan, and let them cook for another 30-60 seconds.
