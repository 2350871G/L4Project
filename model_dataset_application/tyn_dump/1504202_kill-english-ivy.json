Older vines can grow as thick as one's arm, while newer vines are as thin as flower stems. In addition to gathering appropriate cutting supplies, put on a thick pair of gardening gloves to protect your hands as you pull the ivy back."

Even one remaining uncut vine can nourish the ivy further up the tree, so it's important to make sure no vine is left behind. For very old, thick vines, use a handsaw to carefully saw through the vine. As you work, be careful not to make cuts on the tree itself. Ivy weakens trees and makes them more susceptible to disease. Cutting through the bark could cause further damage."

By making two cuts and pulling away the section of ivy at the bottom of the tree, you're blocking the vines higher up the tree from getting essential nutrients, and they'll soon die. Put the cut vines in a pile, then mulch them later so they won't take root again. As you pull the cut vines from the tree, be careful not to remove too much bark with the holdfasts.

Spray the area of ivy you wish to kill, but be careful the glyphosate doesn't reach other plants you want to keep. Herbicides are slow-acting, and must be reapplied every six weeks or so."

Simply cover the border of the ivy you want to keep with several inches (about 7 to 8 inches) of shredded or wood chip mulch. You will need to give this method some time; leave the mulch on the ivy for at least 2 seasons. You may need to add new mulch one or more times during a growing season. Another option is to trim the ivy back to contain it. Use a weed eater or edging tool to cut the vines along the border."
