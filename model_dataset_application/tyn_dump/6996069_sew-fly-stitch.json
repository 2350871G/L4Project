      "description":"This should be about midway between the loop made by the previous two stitches but lower down, so as to form a V shape. As you bring up the needle, catch the loop with the needle. Now you can pull tight and a basic V shape will be formed, with the loop stretched down on each side from points A and B by the stitch created by C."

      "headline":"Reinsert the needle below point C stitch, a little way down.",
      "description":"This time, you have a choice to decide to keep the V shape, in which case, keep the end stitch close to the base of the V, or you can make a Y shape by taking the reinsertion point a little further down and pulling tight. The choice of either the V or the Y formation will be determined by the final look you're seeking. For example, the Y shape is very useful for forming flower stems if embroidering ribbon flowers or buds. Do a row of these stitches horizontally or randomly to create a field or flower bed of flowers. Alternatively, keep working downward in a neat line from the first fly stitch to make a vine or joined pattern. If making a row straight down, always come up where you left the last V or Y shape."
