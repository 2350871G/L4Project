It\u2019s easiest to use a steamer, but a hot kettle or iron works too. Be careful not to burn yourself when creating and using the steam by keeping your hands out of the steam's direct path. If you're using an iron, work carefully to avoid burning the hat on the hot iron."

Slowly move the hat around in the steam for a few seconds so that the hat starts to loosen up, focusing the steam on the sections of the hat you want to reshape. Make sure the hat is close enough to be fully-enveloped in the steam."

You can make a crease in the crown by pressing down with your fingers, roll the brim up on each side, or generally personalize it however you\u2019d like. If you'd like to shape different sections, such as adding a crease to the crown and rolling up the brim, steam and work the hat in separate steps. For example, a felt cowboy hat looks better with indents in the crown, while a straw sun hat looks great with rolled up sides."

You can do this as many times as needed. Take your time while shaping the hat so that you get it just right, sticking it back in the steam after several seconds of shaping. Remember not to hold the hat in the steam for more than a few seconds at a time."

Putting it on a flat table is recommended, and you can place it in natural sunlight or just in a warm room. Avoid setting anything on top of the hat so that it can dry perfectly. The hat should only take about an hour or two to dry in a warm environment. As the hat is drying, you can place it on your head for a few seconds to check the shape, repeating the steaming process if needed."
