If you decide that your shrubs are in need of touching up, however, do it during the colder months while they\u2019re still in their dormant stage. Doing so will help stimulate new growth once the weather warms up. As a rule, the best time to prune your Rose of Sharon is anywhere from March to early May, before the blooms begin to open. Cutting back your Rose of Sharon too early or too late can \u201cshock\u201d the plant, leaving it vulnerable to the elements and stunting healthy new growth."

Try to shear each offshoot as close to the larger connecting branch as possible. You should be able to use your pruning shears to tackle most of the trimming. For thick or stubborn branches, you may need to grab a pair of heavy-duty loppers or a handheld pruning saw.

          "description":"Suckers are slender stalks that grow vertically out of the roots of woody shrubs like Rose of Sharon. They most often appear along the lower portion of the main branches or on the ground directly beneath the plant. The best way to deal with suckers is to snip each stalk as close to the base as possible, as this destroys their connection with the plant's roots and makes them slower to grow back. Once they begin sprouting, suckers will typically return within a few months. This means you may need to cut them back 2-3 times a year. Not only are root suckers an eyesore, they can also sap vital nutrients from the soil if they're not removed right away."

As long as the hardy living wood at the base of the plant is intact, it will return to produce eye-catching blooms year after year. The practice of significantly reducing a plant's overall size is referred to as \"hard\" or \"rejuvenation\" pruning. Hard pruning is useful for promoting healthy new growth in old or failing plants. It\u2019s safe to prune Rose of Sharon down to bare stubs that are only 2\u20133 feet (0.61\u20130.91 m) in length while it\u2019s still dormancy. Keep in mind that the more branches you cut, the fewer flowers there will be when the shrub finally blooms. However, the flowers that are there will be much bolder and more vibrant since the plant will be able to devote more of its resources to the remaining growth."
