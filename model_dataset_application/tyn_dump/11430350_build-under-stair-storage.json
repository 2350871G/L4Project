          "description":"Hold a stud finder against the wall underneath your stairs and turn it on. Slowly run it along the side of your wall until the light turns on or it makes a beeping noise. Mark the location of the stud with a pencil so you know where the stud is located. Continue marking studs under the stairs so you know where you can place your box shelves. When you\u2019re finished building your shelves, they will look like rectangular boxes that recess into the wall. If you don\u2019t have a stud finder, knock on the drywall and listen for a solid sound behind it. If it sounds hollow or echoes, then there isn\u2019t a stud. If the studs or framing from your stairs are already exposed, you can skip this step."

Place the sides of the box directly on the edges of the studs so you can get the most storage. Take a few steps away from the wall and look at the layout of the boxes to see if you\u2019re happy with it. Write down the dimensions of your boxes so you don\u2019t forget them later. You can make the boxes as short or tall as you want. The boxes must fit underneath the stair\u2019s stringer, which is the angled bottom support on your staircase."

          "description":"Poke a hole through your drywall with a drywall saw along the edge of one of the studs. Follow along the edge of the stud with the blade of your saw to cut out the outline for the boxes. Keep your cuts as straight as possible so you don\u2019t damage any of the other drywall surrounding it. Once you cut out the full outline of the boxes, pull the drywall away from the wall. You can get a drywall saw from your local hardware store. If you don\u2019t have a drywall saw, then you can also use a reciprocating saw to make the cuts faster. You don\u2019t need to cut through any of the studs.Warning: Check what\u2019s on the other side of the wall before you make your cuts if you\u2019re able to. If you don\u2019t know what\u2019s on the other side of the drywall, then contact an electrician or a home inspector to look at it for you."

Draw the pieces for all the boxes on your plywood so you can easily cut them out along the outlines. Put the wood on a flat surface and use a circular saw to cut out the pieces. Wear safety glasses whenever you use power tools to protect your eyes. You may also use a handsaw to cut the wood, but it will take longer and the lines may be more crooked.

Once you have the frame to size, screw the edges together every 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) to secure the pieces together. Place a flat piece of plywood on top of the frame and screw it along the edges to make the back of your shelf. Continue building the other boxes the same way.

Once you have the frame to size, screw the edges together every 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315 cm) to secure the pieces together.

Make sure the tops of the boards are perfectly level or else the drawer will teeter or rock when you try to set it. Screw the supports into each of the 1 in \u00d7 3 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 7.6 cm) boards attached to the runners. Continue adding supports to the rest of the drawers. You can also add an additional support in the middle of the boards if you want, but it\u2019s not required. Saw plywood to match the dimensions of the openings in your walls. Measure the openings you cut out for your drawers with a tape measure so you know what dimensions you need for your drawers. Get enough \u20444\u2013\u20442 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) plywood so you can create boxes that sit on top of the 1 in \u00d7 3 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 7.6 cm) supports and extend to the back wall behind the stairs. Use a circular saw to cut through the wood along the outlines that you drew. The exact sizes of the drawers depend on how tall you want them and how many you plan on adding. This build creates a single drawer between each stud, but you can construct shelves on top of them for additional storage space. Make plywood boxes that are the same depth as the runners. Dry-fit the sides of the box to make a rectangular frame for your drawers. Screw the frame together with 2 in (5.1 cm) wood screws so the edges are perfectly level with one another. Put the bottom piece of the box on top of the frame and secure it in place with screws every 4\u20135 inches (10\u201313 cm) along the edge. Leave the top of the box open so you can access your belongings. Set the box on top of the 1 in \u00d7 3 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 7.6 cm) supports and push it into the wall to make sure it fits inside of the hole snugly. You can add shelves to the box if you want to have more room for storage. Screw the boxes onto the supports attached to the drawer runners. Fully extend the drawer runners out from under your staircase and place the boxes you made on top of the 1 in \u00d7 3 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 7.6 cm) boards. Hold the box tightly against the runners and use 2 in (5.1 cm) wood screws every 6 inches (15 cm) to secure it to the supports underneath. Repeat the process for any other boxes and drawers you have. Cut MDF that\u2019s the same size as the opening in your wall. Medium-density fibreboard (MDF) is a lightweight wood that has a smooth finish and will make the end of your drawer look clean. Get a piece of MDF that\u2019s \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) thick and use your circular saw to cut it down to the size you need for each opening in your wall. You can get MDF from your local hardware or home improvement store. The employees at the store may be able to cut the MDF to size for you. You can also use regular plywood, but the wood grain will be visible when you\u2019re finished. Attach the MDF to the front of the drawer with screws to conceal it. Line up the MDF with the box on your drawer and position it so it covers up any of the areas you cut out. Screw through the MDF every 6 inches (15 cm) to secure it to the front side of the drawer. When you\u2019re finished, the drawer will have a smooth finish and be hidden when you close it. Ask a helper to assist you to ensure the MDF doesn\u2019t move around while you\u2019re attaching it. You can choose to paint the MDF if you want, or leave it unfinished for a more rustic look. Screw handles or knobs onto the MDF if you want to make them easier to pull out.",
