          "description":"Depending on the time of year, you\u2019ll need to bring a variety of clothing with you, as your body temperature will drop the longer you sit still. Likewise, you might get warm and want to shed a few layers. If you stargaze in the fall or winter, try thermal underwear, sweaters, hats, gloves or mittens, and scarves. If you stargaze in the spring or summer, wear multiple, light layers. Try a zip-up hoodie, light jacket, hat, and jeans. Bring one warm coat in case the temperature drops dramatically during the night."

          "description":"You will want to keep your eyes trained on the sky for an extended period of time, so comfort is a must. Your neck will become tired and sore very quickly unless you lay flat on your back or recline in a chair. Good options for comfort and warmth are: a yoga mat, pillows, tarp (in case of dew or damp grass), camping pad, camping chair, or reclining deck chair. If prefer to sit up, remember to put something between yourself and the ground so that you don\u2019t catch a chill."

          "description":"Bringing a blanket or two will both keep you warm and add a layer of cushioning to your chair, mat, or tarp. Sit under or on top of a blanket, or bundle it under your head for extra support. Don\u2019t bring blankets that are not washable. Anything you bring with you while stargazing may get dirty or wet, since you will be outdoors."

          "description":"You may be out for a while, so it\u2019s important to supply yourself with snacks and beverages. Sustenance can be both fun and practical, so remember to pack things that you like! Popular beverage options are: hot chocolate, coffee, tea (especially during the colder months), water, soda, and beer or wine (if you are over 21 and have a designated driver). Portable, energy-filled foods you might want to bring are: trail mix, granola bars, chocolate, beef jerky, soup in a thermos, or pre-made sandwiches."

This way, you\u2019ll have shelter from the elements and can take a rest if you\u2019re feeling tired or worn out. You can also store your extra snacks, drinks, chairs, and blankets underneath the covering."

You\u2019ll also be more comfortable than you would be in the winter, and can pack a bit lighter. You are most likely to see meteor showers in the summertime. The \u201cPerseids\u201d meteor shower is awe-inspiring, and visible from nearly everywhere in the Northern Hemisphere. It occurs every August. Some constellations that can be seen year-round (meaning they are \u201ccircumpolar\u201d) are: Cassiopeia, Ursa Major, and Cepheus."

Deer, bears, coyotes, raccoons, and possums are common camp-crashers. Research what animals are found in your area, and keep a sharp eye out while you are outside at night. Wherever you decide to stargaze, always bring bug spray. You certainly won\u2019t be comfortable if you\u2019re swatting at mosquitos all night! You can bring a bright floodlight or something to make loud noises with, to deter animals that may come near while you  are stargazing."

But, if you need to look around after doing so, you should use an infra-red light to avoid having to re-adjust your eyes to the darkness. A red light is easier on the eyes, and will not disturb your stargazing environment. Your eyes will need anywhere from five to thirty minutes to adjust to the darkness, and turning a bright, white light off and on will deter this adjustment process. You can cover your regular flashlight with red cellophane, rather than buying an infra-red light."
