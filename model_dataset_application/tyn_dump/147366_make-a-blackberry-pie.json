It's important to bake the pie at higher heat first to ensure that the crust becomes crispy and flaky and the filling is cooked all the way through. This should take about 10-15 minutes, depending on your oven. While the oven is preheating, you can start on the next steps of the recipe."

Roll out your dough to make a circle about \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) thick, and flip the pie pan upside down on top of the dough to ensure that it extends around 1\u20133 inches (2.5\u20137.6 cm) from the outer rim. Remove the pan and lift the dough with a rolling pin. Gently place the crust in the dish, pressing it down carefully until it is touching the bottom and sides of the pan.

Use a spoon or spatula to stir the mixture until it's an even consistency with no clumps of flour or sugar. If you do have clumps, use the spoon or spatula to break them up and continue stirring. Keep in mind that you can use fresh or frozen blueberries. If you're using frozen blueberries, you may have to stir the mixture a bit longer to break up clumps.If you're using frozen blackberries, be sure to defrost them and drain any excess liquid before you begin making your filling."

If you're having trouble deciding what kind of design to use for your crust, you can look up inspiration pictures online. If you want a simple pie without a design on the crust, you can skip this step and leave the crust intact.Tip: You can make your pie crust themed for the season by using small cookie cutters to make fun shapes.
