          "description":"Compare the measurements of your curtains and curtain rods to the window itself. Most curtain rods can adjust size to fit a variety of windows. Measure the length of the curtains to determine how high you want to hang them. Hang the curtains with your hands to the window to see the best location. It will help to have a pal test the location of the curtains for you. Avoid framing the window too tightly, which can make it seem smaller. To make the window seem larger, hang the curtains high above it. Some prefer curtains to cover the window's entirety, while others prefer the curtains to cover the top half of the window.
