  "text":" Using a Piping Bag Bake your cupcakes and let them cool completely. If you fill the cupcakes while they are still warm, the filling will melt and turn the cupcakes gooey. You can bake the cupcakes from scratch using your favorite recipe, or you can bake them using a boxed mix. Insert a decorating tip into a piping bag. Snip off the bottom of a piping bag first, then insert a decorating tip into the bag. A small, sound tip will work the best, but you can use a larger star-shaped tip as well. Fill the bag with 1 to 2 tablespoons of your desired filling. Smooth fillings, such as custard, puddings, buttercream frosting, or whipped cream will work the best. You can also try jam or jelly, but make sure that it's not the chunky kind, otherwise you might clog the tip. Insert the tip into the top of the cupcake. Push it into the cupcake by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). You do not need to cut a hole into the cupcake first. Squeeze the filling into the cupcake. Depending on the size of the cupcake, you should be able to squeeze 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling into it. If the filling starts to leak outside of the hole, stop; you have filled the cupcake as much as possible. Frost and decorate the cupcake as desired. Use a piping bag and a large round or star shaped decorator's tip to pipe buttercream frosting onto the cupcake. You can also use chocolate ganache. Glace icing made from powdered sugar and water is not recommended, however; it is too thin and will sink into the hole. Using a Paring Knife Start with baked and cooled cupcakes. You can make the cupcakes from scratch, or you can make them using a store-bought mix. Once you finish baking the cupcakes, let them cool completely. If you don't, the filling will melt. This method is great for making candy-filled cupcakes. Insert a paring knife into the top of the cupcake at an angle. Hold the blade so that the flat side is facing the edge of the cupcake. It should by at a 45-degree angle to the cupcake. Don't push the blade too deep into the cupcake, otherwise the frosting will come out the bottom. If you don't have a paring knife, you can use a teaspoon instead. Cut a cone out of the cupcake. Keep the tip of the blade inside the center of the cupcake. Rotate the cupcake while cutting around the top of the cupcake in a circle. Aim to make the hole about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. To make candy-filled cupcakes, make the hole about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) deep. Pull the cone shape out of the cupcake. Cut the cone in half and discard the pointed part. You will use the top, flat part to plug the hole at the end. You can also eat the pointed part or save it to make cake pops. Fill the hole halfway with your favorite filling. Fill a plastic bag or a piping bag with your favorite filling. Snip the tip off, and pipe the filling into the hole. You do not need to insert a decorator's tip into the bag.buttercream frosting, custard, and whipped cream are all great options. You can also try jam or lemon curd for something more interesting. Do not fill the hole more than halfway, otherwise the filling will leak out in the next step. To make candy-filled cupcakes, fill the hole with 1 teaspoon of sprinkles. Try to use a variety of different shapes, sizes, and colors. Plug the hole in the cupcake. Place the top part of the cone back onto the cupcake; make sure that the smooth side of the plug (not the cut part) is facing up. Gently press down on the plug to seal it, but not so hard that the filling comes out. Frost the cupcake as desired. You can frost the cupcake using a piping bag and buttercream frosting. You can also pour some glace icing made from powdered sugar and water. Chocolate ganache would also work well. Using a Apple Corer Bake your cupcakes and let them cool down completely. You can make the cupcakes from scratch or you can use a boxed recipe. Be sure to let them cool completely, otherwise the filling will melt. Push an apple corer into the center of the cupcake. You can also use a small melon scoop instead. If you are using an apple corer, be careful not to push it in too deep, or the frosting will come out of the bottom of the cupcake. Rotate the corer. Keep the corer in place as you twist it. The edges of the corer will cut into the cupcake and create a hole. Pull the corer out of the cupcake. Discard the cupcake that's inside the corer or save it to make cake pops. You can also eat it instead. Fill the cupcakes with your desired filling. You can fill your cupcakes with just about anything, from custard to jam to buttercream frosting. If you are using frosting, you can pipe it into the hole with a piping bag. If you are using a more fluid filling, such as custard or jam, or you can push it into the hole with a small teaspoon. Decorate the cupcake. While easy, this method leaves behind a hole on top of the cupcake. Use a piping back fitted with a large round or star shaped tip to pipe buttercream frosting onto the cupcake. Chocolate ganache and glace icing made from powdered sugar and water is not recommended for this method because it is too translucent and will mix into the filling. Filling Cupcakes Prior to Baking Preheat your oven and prepare the cupcake pan. Preheat the oven to the temperature specified on your recipe. For most recipes, this will be around 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C), but yours may be different. Next, insert cupcake liners into your cupcake pan. This method is recommended for chocolate and jam fillings. It is not recommended for frosting, pudding, or cream fillings. Prepare your cupcake batter.
