They will test to see if you have any severe reactions to hornet venom. If your doctor confirms you aren't allergic, you can consider removing the nest on your own.

Bald-faced hornets are the most common hornets in North America. The hornet's body is mostly black with white markings on their abdomen and head. Their nests are usually found at least 3 feet (0.91 m) off the ground and are primarily gray in color. European hornets are common hornets in North America and Europe. Their bodies are yellow and red, and they can grow up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) in length. Their nests are usually in a hollow tree or wall void 6 feet (1.8 m) off the ground. Asian giant hornets are the largest hornet species that are primarily found in Asia and are extremely aggressive. Their bodies are orange and brown and can grow up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) in length. The Asian giant hornets' nests are usually underground or in tree cavities."

The dust will coat the hornets and the inside of the nest so it's more difficult for the hornets to move around. Once you've spread the dust, leave the area to prevent any stings.
