Decide whether you want to make a physical goal post using materials, or a finger goal post when the time calls for it. To make finger goal posts, simply position your thumbs horizontally and connect the tips of each thumb. Point both index fingers upwards. You decide the height of the goal posts on the field is based on how high or low you place your fingers. To make a goal post, bend two straws and tape the bent edges together to form a \u201cU\u201d shape. Cut a small X incision in the bottom of a paper cup. Stick the firm end of another bendy straw into the hole and tape it into place. Wrap the bent part of the straw around the base of the \u201cU\u201d made from the first two straws, and tape that into place. Now you have a field goal you can place down wherever and whenever needed."

Write the name of each player or team at the top of each column. Tally the points throughout the game in the respective columns. Winner can be whoever gets to 35 points first or whoever has the most points after 15 minutes. Adjust the score limit or timeframe to your liking."

Then \u201cflick\u201d the corner of the ball hanging off the side with your index finger.

In order to score a touchdown, one part of the football must hang off the opponent's edge. A touchdown is worth 6 points, if you want to follow actual football guidelines. Yet, if you want to keep the game simple, make each touchdown 1 point. To double check if the football did in fact hang over the edge to score a touchdown, bend down so that you can look upwards at the bottom of the surface edge and the football. This angle will make it easier to determine if a piece of the football is past the edge."

If you can kick the football between the goalposts, you get 3 points if following football guidelines or 1 point if keeping the game simple. To kick a field goal, place the football vertically, pressing one point with your index finger onto the surface. Hold it there to keep it steady, and when you are ready, flick the football with your free index finger towards the goal posts."
