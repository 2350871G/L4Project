The leaves and flowers tend to have a milder flavor when harvested in the cool of the morning, before the heat of the day stresses them. Nasturtiums grow well with minimal tending, so there\u2019s no real need to use non-organic methods. If you find aphids nibbling on the leaves or flowers, simply spray them off with water. The entire plant is edible, though most people opt for the colorful flowers and buds. Young leaves are tender and delicious, while the stems and older leaves can be rather tough in texture and pungent in flavor."

Get creative with your own go-to recipes, or search online for recipes that feature nasturtiums. Making Nasturtium Pesto Place a large pot of water over high heat on the stove. Put a lid on the pot to speed up the process of bringing the water to a boil. Make an ice water bath in a large bowl. Fill a large bowl about half-full of cold water, then add roughly the number of ice cubes made by 2 ice cube trays. Do this while the pot is coming to a boil on the stove.
