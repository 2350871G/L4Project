When the fruit feels soft, it\u2019s ready for use. Noni juice is also sold bottled, as dried fruit, as a powder, or as a capsule. These can all be consumed immediately and may help you avoid noni juice\u2019s nasty smell and taste."

If this is the case, add a half a cup (120 mL) of cold water and add more as needed. Blend the fruit until you end up with a thick, applesauce-like juice. You can slice the fruit into smaller portions if it doesn\u2019t all fit in your blender. Since a ripened noni is soft, you can also crush it with your hands."

You only need about one fourth of a cup (60 mL) of noni juice a day. A single fruit provides enough juice for two people, so don\u2019t hesitate to thin the juice with water."

For example, try blending five oz (.14 kg) carrots, a peeled orange, two tablespoons of coconut milk, a cup of (240 mL) coconut water, four oz (.11 kg) pineapple, two tablespoons of shredded coconut, and a cup of ice with a teaspoon of your strained noni juice. You may also simply pour a little bit of fruit juice or honey into a glass with the noni juice. It won\u2019t completely hide the noni flavor, but you\u2019ll get used to it over time."

As you get used to the juice, you can increase the dosage or have a second dose later in the day. Take no more than three cups (750 mL) a day. For noni extract in capsule form, limit yourself to 500 mg a day. Read the label to find out how much extract is in each pill."
