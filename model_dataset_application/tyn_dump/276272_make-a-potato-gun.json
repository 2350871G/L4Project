  "text":" Getting the Pipes Ready Get all your parts ready for assembly. All the parts necessary for this project can be bought at your local hardware store if you don\u2019t already have them at home. Some hardware stores may even cut the PVC pipe you\u2019ll need for this project to length as a free service or for a minor fee. You'll need a 4-in (10.1-cm) wide PVC pipe that's 2 feet (61 cm) long and a 2-in (5-cm) wide PVC pipe that is 5 feet (1.5 m) long. Only use Schedule 40 PVC pipe. \"Schedule\" refers to the thickness of the pipe's walls. Pipe thinner than Sch 40 will be unsafe and could burst under high pressure. Measure and mark your PVC pieces, if necessary. If your PVC pipes weren\u2019t cut for you, you\u2019ll need to do it yourself. Use a felt tipped marker to mark the PVC at the following lengths so they\u2019re ready to be cut:\n4-in (10.1-cm) wide PVC marked at 2 feet (61 cm)\n2-in (5-cm) wide PVC marked at 5 feet (1.5 m) Cut the pipes along the mark using a hacksaw. It may help to clamp the pipes down to a work bench or have someone hold the pipe on a flat surface as you saw. The cuts don\u2019t need to be perfect. Once you\u2019re finished, remove plastic burrs by rubbing the cut edges with a medium grit sandpaper. Clean the PVC pipes with a rag. Grit or plastic shavings from cutting the PVC can negatively impact the seal of parts when fitted together. Take a clean rag and wipe all parts of the PVC clean. If there are a lot of shavings, use a vacuum cleaner. Gluing the Launcher Assemble one end of the 4-in wide PVC segment. Screw a 4-in wide PVC plug into place on the threaded end of the female adapter. On one end of the 4-in segment, liberally apply PVC cement around the outer lip. Repeat this process to the inner lip of the PVC female adapter. Fit the adapter onto the end of the segment.

The 4-in wide PVC segment will eventually become the combustion chamber for the launcher. Attach the coupler to the 4-in wide PVC segment at the opposite end. Apply PVC cement around the outer lip of the segment and the inner lip of the PVC coupler. Slide the coupler into place on the end of segment with nothing attached. Glue the reducer in the coupler. Apply more PVC cement to the inner lip of the coupler and below the outward flanging collar of the 4- to 2-in reducer. Nest the reducer in the coupler until the collar of the reducer meets the end of the coupler. Add the barrel of the launcher. The barrel of the launcher will be made up of the 2-in wide PVC segment. Spread the PVC cement on the inner lip of the reducer and the outer lip of one end of the 2-in wide PVC segment. Slide the barrel into the reducer until it is about even with the base of the coupler. Wait 24 hours for the PVC cement to harden and cure. If you use your potato launcher before the PVC cement has enough time to harden, the launcher may explode. Explosive force in the combustion chamber puts stress on the PVC when you shoot an item. Adding a Spark Generator Drill holes in the combustion chamber for your spark generator.

Your guard can be cut short so it only protects the sparking components or longer to cover the leads up to the trigger. Firing the Launcher Insert a spud and open the end PVC plug. Press a spud into the barrel end of the launcher so it fits snugly. Use a stick to push the potato into the base of the barrel. After that, turn over the launcher and unscrew the end PVC plug from the female adaptor.
