          "description":"Measure the length and width of the space with a measuring tape. Use these numbers to determine how big of a piece of laminate countertop you need to purchase to cut to size. Laminate countertops come in a standard width of 25 in (64 cm). You can get pieces of different lengths that you can cut down to the exact size you need. This method will work for cutting all types of laminate countertops, including Formica. You can also use the same method to cut solid wood countertops, such as butcher block countertops."

Tip: If the counter area you need to cover is divisible by exactly 2 ft (0.61 m), then you can just get a piece that fits and you won\u2019t need to cut it to size.

This will keep the laminate from chipping during cutting. You can use masking tape or blue painter\u2019s tape that is about 2\u20134 in (5.1\u201310.2 cm) wide for this so you don\u2019t have to be super precise when placing it."

Do this in 2-3 places on the tape and then draw a line through the marks with a ruler or carpenter\u2019s square. If you have a large carpenter\u2019s square, you can just use that to measure in from the edge of the countertop and draw your cut line along it in one go."

You will need to use a circular saw for this that has a metal guard rail. If the distance between the blade of the saw and the outside edge of the guard rail is 4 in (10 cm), then clamp the wood so the edge is 4 in (10 cm) away from the cut line. Clamp the wood to the part of the counter that is secured to the workbench.

Always wear proper protective gear when cutting countertops. Wear safety goggles, a face mask, and ear protection.

To decide how far to mark the cut lines in from the outline, measure the distance from the sink\u2019s mounting lip to the basin of the sink. Mark the cut lines approximately this far in from the outline to allow the sink to rest on top of the counter supported by its mounting lip.

Stone is much heavier than other types of countertops, so you need a very stable work surface. This will also reduce vibrations and movement that can lead to chipping.

Press down the power button to get it up to speed, push it slowly in about 2 in (5.1 cm) along the line, then back it out and release the power button to stop it spinning. This is called a back cut and is important so that the stone doesn\u2019t chip or break at the end of your cut where it will be more fragile. Use a circular saw with a diamond blade for cutting stone. You can use a wet circular saw to reduce the amount of dust in the air while you cut. Make sure the depth of the saw\u2019s blade is set to just a bit deeper than the thickness of the stone slab. Make sure to put on safety goggles, a dust mask, and ear protection before you start cutting."

Press the power button to get the blade up to speed, then slowly push the saw all the way along the cut line until you meet the back cut. Focus on keeping the saw blade aligned with the cut line and push very slowly. The blade will do most of the work, so you just need to apply light and steady pressure to push it along slowly.

    "Place 2-3 strips of painter\u2019s tape over the approximate area you will be cutting.",
    "This will protect the surface of the stone and prevent chipping as you cut.",
    "The placement of the tape doesn\u2019t need to be perfect, just make sure you cover the area where your cut line will be.",
    "You will mark the line on top of the tape.",
    "Draw your cut line onto the painter\u2019s tape with a straight edge and marker.",
    "Use a straight edge like a metal ruler or carpenter\u2019s square to measure in from the end of the slab and mark where your cut line will go on the tape.",
    "Draw a cut line along the whole length of the tape using the straight edge.",
    "Double-check your measurements to make sure the line is the same distance from the end of the slab all the way along it.",
    "You won\u2019t be able to make any corrections to your cut after you make it, so measure twice and cut once!",
    "Make a 2 in (5.1 cm) cut in at the far end of the cut line.",
    "Carefully position the blade of a circular saw in front of the end of the cut line (where you will finish the cut).",
    "Press down the power button to get it up to speed, push it slowly in about 2 in (5.1 cm) along the line, then back it out and release the power button to stop it spinning.",
    "This is called a back cut and is important so that the stone doesn\u2019t chip or break at the end of your cut where it will be more fragile.",
    "Use a circular saw with a diamond blade for cutting stone.",
    "You can use a wet circular saw to reduce the amount of dust in the air while you cut.",
    "Make sure the depth of the saw\u2019s blade is set to just a bit deeper than the thickness of the stone slab.",
    "Make sure to put on safety goggles, a dust mask, and ear protection before you start cutting.",
    "Position the saw at the other end of the cut line and cut slowly along it.",
    "Walk back over to the other side of the cut line with your saw and carefully line up the blade with the cut line.",
    "Press the power button to get the blade up to speed, then slowly push the saw all the way along the cut line until you meet the back cut.",
    "Focus on keeping the saw blade aligned with the cut line and push very slowly.",
    "The blade will do most of the work, so you just need to apply light and steady pressure to push it along slowly.",
    "Cutting stone takes longer than cutting other materials like laminate or wood, so be patient and focus on making a straight cut.",
    "Remove the tape and wipe the stone countertop with a damp rag.",
    "Peel off the tape once you finish cutting all the way through.",
    "Wipe away all the dust with a wet rag and you will be left with a clean new stone countertop!",
    "A shop vac will also come in handy for sucking up all the rock dust that is left after cutting the stone countertop.",
    "Use an angle grinder with a diamond blade to make a sink cut out if needed.",
    "Buy a sink that comes with a template for the cutout and trace the template onto masking tape on the countertop.",
    "Cut 1-2 mm inside of the lines with the angle grinder and work in passes until you cut all the way through the slab along the lines.",
    "You can work in sections if it is easier.",
    "For example, cut out a large rectangular middle section first, then cut out the sides.",
    "Leave rounded corners for last so you can cut them out in smaller pieces."
