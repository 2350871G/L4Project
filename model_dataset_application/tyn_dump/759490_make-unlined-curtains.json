          "description":"Because your curtains are going to be unlined, they will still allow some sunlight through. For the lightest look, choose curtains made of lace or a sheer cloth. These will allow the most light through while still showing a simple pattern or color. If you want to block out sunlight, look for a heavy linen fabric. Even without being lined this fabric will dampen the amount of light shining through them, making your room much darker. If you choose a fabric that is patterned, try to find one that is patterned only on one side or that has an identical pattern on both sides. This is because when the sun shines through the fabric, it will cause you to see both patterns at once, making it appear very disorienting. Using a fabric with a high thread count (500+) is more expensive, but will block the most sunlight because it is tightly woven."

          "description":"Although you may not be touching your curtains all the time, the texture of the fabric gives a different appearance when hung in the light. Cotton and polyester fabrics are the most basic for curtain use, and the easiest to sew. Avoid using silk or satin, as they will deteriorate in the sunlight. Sewing jersey knit fabrics is very difficult as they stretch when pulled. They will also begin to puddle on the floor after being hung because of their elasticity. Don\u2019t choose a fabric that is too stiff, as it won\u2019t drape when hung. An example of this is tulle, which offers a pretty option for sheer fabric, but is much too inflexible."

Try finding vintage tablecloths in the size you need to fit your window. These offer a fun mod look to your room. Using patterned sheets is a cheap alternative to buying yardage of fabric. You can look for brand new or vintage sheets in antique or consignment shops."
