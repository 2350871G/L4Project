          "description":"All your bananas need to ripen is a bag, some warmth, and their own ethylene. However, you can add other fruit if you have it. Some other fruits also release ethylene, ripening nearby fruits. The best options are apples, pears, apricots and similar pit fruits, avocados, kiwi, and quince. Other bananas will help as well, but the effect is low unless they're already ripe. Use the ripest fruit you can find, or cut the fruit to encourage more ethylene production. Even other fruits, leafy vegetables, and tubers sometimes produce ethylene if they are severely wounded. If you have no other options, cut them many times and add them to the bag."

This is about room temperature in a heated home. Keeping it in a warmer location, such as on top of the fridge or over the stove, may speed up ripening.
