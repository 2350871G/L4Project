    "Cook them until they're a rich brown color on both sides.",
    "Use tongs to carefully flip them over halfway through the cooking time.",
    "If you're short on prep time, you can skip this step, but the meat may not be as flavorful.",
    "Cut the onion, carrots, ginger, and garlic.",
    "Cut 1 onion into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick slices.",
    "Then, chop 2 carrots into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces.",
