Katina from Meteo: this isn't on the map. When you get to an asteroid field late in the level, there will be some rings that look very much like checkpoints. Pass through all 7 (difficult! It will take some practice) and enter the resulting warp. No boss, just make it to the end. Solar from Fortuna: Shoot down Star Wolf before the bomb goes off. Macbeth from Sector X: Defeat Spyborg before Slippy tries to play hero. A good rule of thumb is to shoot it down before Falco finishes his quote. Remember: the weak spot is the head. Sector Z from Sector X: again, this isn't on the map. When you have to go left or right, go left. Shoot 4 warp gates that appear when notified and pass through them. Then survive the warp. Be careful: it is easy to die here. This is a good route to take if you need the Sector Z medal as Katt won't steal kills from you. Solar from Katina: Shoot the mother-ship core before 1 minute is up. Aquas from Sector Y: Kill 100+ enemies. Sector Z from Zoness: Shoot all the searchlights. Area 6 from:\n-Macbeth: Shoot the 8 switches and then the main switcher. If you came from Zoness Katt will will get 2 and 5 for you. Falco will shoot the last one if he's with you. You also have to have Peppy alive to make it through the main switch and blow up the train. -Sector Z: destroy all 6 missiles."
