There will be separate hoses for the hot and cold, so make sure you disconnect the one that you need to replace. It\u2019s common for some water to drip when the hoses are disconnected. Place a pan under the sink to catch drips. To disconnect the hose, start by loosening the lock nut attaching the hose to the water supply. You'll probably need to loosen it with the adjustable wrench first. To loosen the nut, turn it to the left (counterclockwise). Once you\u2019ve loosened the nut with the wrench, you can twist it off the rest of the way by hand.

If the supply line connects to copper tubing, hold the tubing in 1 hand while loosening the nut with the other to prevent the copper from twisting or breaking. Loosen the nut by turning it to the left (counterclockwise). When you\u2019ve loosened the nut, you can twist it off the rest of the way by hand. Once the second nut is disconnected, you'll be able to remove the old hose. The basin wrench is necessary here because it allows you to access the hard-to-reach nut under the sink.
