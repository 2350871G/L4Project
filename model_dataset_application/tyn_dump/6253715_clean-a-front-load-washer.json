Open the washing machine door as wide as you can and peel back the rubber that runs around the opening. The gasket will remain fixed to the washing machine, but you can pull it open to clean it and make sure nothing is stuck.

If you have pets or people with long hair in your household, you should check the gasket for hair at least once or twice a week. If the gasket looks dusty, you may need to occasionally keep the door on your washer closed. For example, if your dog will be crated in the laundry room overnight, keep the door closed. Dust builds up on the gasket when dust or lint from your dryer or laundry room floats around and lands on the gasket. Cut back on dust particles in the air by regularly changing your lint trap."

This means that the gasket isn't getting dry enough between uses or your soap is leaving behind too much residue. This moisture causes the mold to grow. To remove mildew, spray down the gasket with hot soapy water or a mildew cleaner. Wipe the cleaner away using a clean cloth or rag. You may need several cloths if the gasket is slimy with mildew. Keep spraying and wiping until your cloth comes away clean."

You should also pour 1/2 cup of bleach into the detergent or fabric softener compartment to ensure that your entire machine gets clean. After the cycle is done, run a few more cycles through without adding any bleach. This will remove the bleach smell from the machine before you wash clothes in your machine again. If you notice black mold on mildew spots after running your machine, you may need to put on gloves, a mask and scrub the spots using a bleach solution. Dip a toothbrush in a solution of no more than 10% bleach and scrub the mildew."
