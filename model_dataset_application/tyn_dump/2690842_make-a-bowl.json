  "text":" Clay coil bowl Purchase some craft clay that can self-harden. Ask at your local craft store for appropriate suggestions. Roll a small but decent-sized lump of the clay into a ball.  Continue to roll this ball into a fat sausage shape.  Keep rolling until you have a long and thin sausage shape. This should be an even width all the way along its length. Starting at one end of the sausage, coil into a spiral. Keep the coil tight and fitted together. Coil around and around until the sausage length ends. This should be sufficient for the base. Make more long sausage lengths from the clay. Each length made should be long enough to do one circle of the bowl from this point on. Add the next length on top of the coiled base. To join, simply attach where the last coil ended and blend in the join with your fingers or a small clay spatula. After adding each new coil, check that it is firmly stuck to the coil below. Keep adding a new length on top of the old length, coiling until the bowl is the height you'd like it to be. Finish the end by blending into the top coil neatly. Either leave natural clay color or paint with a suitable paint. If adding a pattern, choose something that fits your d\u00e9cor or represents something meaningful for a gift recipient.
