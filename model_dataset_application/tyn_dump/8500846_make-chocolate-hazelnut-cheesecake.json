Place 1 cup (85 g) of graham cracker crumbs, \u2153 cup (50 g) of ground hazelnuts and \u00bc cup (50 g) of packed light brown sugar into a food processor. Blitz the mixture to combine the ingredients. Pour in \u00bc cup (55 g) of melted unsalted butter and \u00bd teaspoon of vanilla extract. Blitz the mixture to incorporate the butter. Since the graham crackers and hazelnuts are already ground, you won't need to process the crust mixture very much. The food processor just helps combine the crust quickly."

          "description":"Grease or spray a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan with cooking spray. Dump the crust mixture into the bottom of the pan and use your fingers to firmly press it into the pan. Bake the crust for 7 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove it and let it cool while you make the cheesecake filling. You could also use the bottom of a glass or measuring cup to press the crumb crust into the pan."

Pour 2 cups (473 ml) of heavy whipping cream into a small saucepan. Turn the heat on to medium, so the cream just begins to bubble a little. Remove the cream from heat and pour it over the semisweet chocolate. Whisk the ganache until it's smooth. Put it aside while you make the rest of the filling. You should whisk the ganache slowly, so the hot cream doesn't splash you."

Scrape the sides occasionally, so all of the cream cheese becomes fluffy. Slowly beat in \u00be cup (150 g) of sugar. If the cream cheese is cold, it will be difficult to beat and the cream cheese won't become light and fluffy."

Add 2 large eggs, but beat them in one at a time on low speed. The cream cheese filling should now appear runny. It will thicken a little as you stir in the ganache."
