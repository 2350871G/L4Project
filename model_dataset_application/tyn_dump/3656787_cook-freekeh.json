Mix slightly to moisten all the freekeh granules and to spread the salt and oil. You can use either cracked grain freekeh or whole grain freekeh. Either option will work. To boil the water, fill a tea kettle or small saucepan with water and heat it on the stove over high heat until bubbles start to form. Alternatively, you can boil the water by placing it in a separate microwave-safe dish and microwaving it in 30 to 60 second intervals until bubbles start to form. Place wooden chopsticks in the water to break the surface tension as you microwave it, thereby preventing the water from super-heating and breaking the dish."

Make sure that the saucepan has a lid. The contents of the saucepan should take up half to three-quarters of the total volume. If the pan is much fuller than that, the water might boil over. Make sure that you use cool to cold water. Cool water will heat more evenly, so the grains of freekeh will cook more evenly, as well.

Once the freekeh seems tender, remove the saucepan from the stove and let it stand for 5 minutes covered and 5 more minutes uncovered. Letting the freekeh stand while covered allows the grains to finish absorbing the water. Letting it stand uncovered lets the freekeh cool down slightly. Mix the yogurt, lemon juice, and garlic. In a small, separate bowl, whisk together the three ingredients until smooth and evenly distributed. Add a sprinkle of salt, if desired, to draw out more of the flavors. Save time by doing this step as you wait for the freekeh to cool. Stir the herbs into the pilaf. Once the pilaf is warm instead of hot, stir in the parsley, mint, and coriander until evenly distributed throughout the pilaf. Taste the pilaf and adjust the seasonings as needed. Serve with yogurt and pine nuts. Scoop the freekeh pilaf into individual serving dishes and garnish each portion with a spoonful of the yogurt mix. Garnish with pine nuts. The pine nuts accentuate the nutty flavor of the freekeh. You can also garnish with additional parsley or a drizzle of olive oil. Freekeh Tabouleh Toss the cooked freekeh with oil and lemon juice. Combine 2 cups (500 ml) cooked freekeh with 1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) lemon juice. Toss well to evenly coat all the grains in the oil and lemon juice.
