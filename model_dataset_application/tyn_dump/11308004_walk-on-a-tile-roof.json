Once tiles get wet, they become even slicker and could cause you to slip and fall. If it rained recently or your roof is wet for any reason, wait 1-2 days so the tiles have time to dry before you stand on them. Never get on your roof while it\u2019s wet since it increases the likelihood that you\u2019ll fall down."

Look for shoes that have soft rubber soles with grips, such as sneakers or light work boots, so you get better traction on the tiles while you\u2019re walking on them.

Place the base of the ladder \u00bc of its height away from your home and make sure it\u2019s on level ground so it stays sturdy. As you climb the ladder, maintain 3 points of contact at all times so you\u2019re less likely to lose your balance or fall down. For example, if you have a 16 ft (4.9 m) ladder, you would place its base 4 feet (1.2 m) feet away from your home. Ask a helper to hold the ladder in place while you climb it so it\u2019s less likely to fall down.Warning: Avoid standing on the top 2 rungs of the ladder since you could easily lose your balance and cause it to fall."

Put your legs through the loops on the safety harness and tighten them around your thighs. Put the top of the harness around your waist and tighten it so it\u2019s secure. Tie a rope around a sturdy object on your roof, such as a chimney, to use as an anchor to break your fall. You can buy a safety harness online or from a home improvement store. You can also make your own harness with ropes. While you don\u2019t need a safety harness for a roof with a gentle slope, you can still wear one if you want to reduce the risk of falling down. If you don\u2019t have a chimney or sturdy object on your roof, slide 2-3 tiles on your roof up so you can access the rafters underneath. Screw a harness anchor onto the rafters and tie the rope to it."
