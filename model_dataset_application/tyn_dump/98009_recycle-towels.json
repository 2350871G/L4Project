Choose a towel with a spot that isn\u2019t too worn so your washcloths still look fresh. Make a zigzag stitch or sew a hem either by hand or with a sewing machine to prevent the towel from fraying. You could save a clean piece of a quality towel to use as a face cloth or a washcloth to hang in your bathroom."

Then, set aside the towels to scrub gunk in your kitchen, bathroom, or anywhere else. If you need something thicker, stitch a pair of smaller washcloths together."

The extra padding could mean the difference between something getting to your destination in one piece or in fragments. It also means you don\u2019t need to buy packing peanuts or rely on newspapers that could leave ink stains. Towels are also good for keeping things dry and absorbing spilled liquids.

Then, create the pad liner out of an absorbent towel. Stitch it onto the center of the pad to create something reusable and eco-friendly. For instance, the liner is the long, oval-shaped pad that fits along the middle of the base cloth you stitch together. Find it on a regular pad to see where to place it on your handmade one. Remember to wash the cloth pad with soap and water before using it. Cloth pads are reusable, so they are great for saving money and cutting down plastic waste."

Another option is to cut a soft cloth like flannel into diapers and trim towels into pads. Sew a pad to the center of each cloth diaper to finish it. Towels are great for padding thinner diapers since they are absorbent. They can also be cut to any size you need."

You could use different colors in order to make the coolest bath rug that matches with the rest of your bathroom. Try making a patchwork rug by cutting towels into squares or stripes and sewing them together. Another option is to cut towels into 3 in (7.6 cm)-wide strips, then use them to create a circular mat. Stack 3 strips, sew them together at one end, and pin each strip so they are like tubes. Twist the tubes around one another until the mat is the size you want."

Keep the robe relatively loose so it rests comfortably on you when you put it on. When you\u2019re done, cut a couple of straps out of a towel or another fabric to stitch to the cover up. You can take some liberties to design the cover up any way you want. For example, cut curves into the top of the towels to create a deeper neckline. You could also cut a towel to make a sash to tie across your waist. If a regular beach towel is too big for you, try folding a single towel in half and making the cover up out of it. You may need to resort to smaller bath towels to make cover ups for children."

Then, twist the end of the towel around until you reach your forehead. Finish the wrap by tucking the twisted portion underneath the part of the towel covering the back of your head. This is a great way to get more use out of a worn towel. Hide it in your closet and pull it out when you need it. Towel turbans help dry your hair but let you continue on with the rest of your routine while you wait."

Stuff it with foam to make the sole more supportive. Then, make a cutout for the top of your foot and sew it to the sole to complete the slipper. Use stuffing or batting from a craft store to make the slippers fuller and softer. Try stuffing the soles for cushioning."

Add handles by cutting smaller strips from the towel and sewing them onto the open end of the bag. You can then add any decorations you want, such as by painting it or using a hot glue gun to glue on rhinestones. Customize your bag by using different colors of cloth. Also, try cutting and sewing on decorations for other towels or lining the inside of the bag with fabric. Adjust the size of the bag by using different towels. Take advantage of an old beach towel to make a big bag to carry beach gear when you\u2019re out enjoying summer weather, for instance."

Make the squares 1 in \u00d7 1 in (2.5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm) or smaller to fit them inside your project. They are great for pillows, cushions, bean bags, stuffed animals, and other crafts. For example, towels are very handy as quilt batting. Quilt batting is normally stuffed between layers of fabric for heaviness and warmth. If you don\u2019t wish to cut up a towel, you could try rolling it up. Cut-up towels are better since the pieces are softer like the kind of polyfill you would get from a craft store. However, rolled towels are useful in a pinch, such as when you need a makeshift pillow."

Fold the rolled tube in half, tie the ends together, and then decorate them to create your bunny. You can then slip an ice cube into the towel to take the sting out of bruises. Bunnies are simple to make, but your imagination doesn\u2019t have to stop there. For example, you could fold towels into different shapes to create elephants and other animals. It\u2019s like origami except with reusable material. Another option is to cut shapes out of the towel and sew them together. It\u2019s a great way to make dolls.

To make a draft stopper, measure the width of your door or window, then get towels longer than them. Roll the towels up together, securing them with pieces of yarn or string. Set the draft stopper next to the door or window to seal out drafts. For a better-looking draft stopper, cut a fabric like fleece and fold it to form a tube. Stuff it with the towels and sew it shut.

Then, mix in water until the cement turns into a smooth paste like peanut butter. Add the old towel next, swirling it in the cement until it is saturated. Finish by setting the towel out to dry in sunlight for up to 7 days until it hardens. Drape the towel so it hardens into the shape you desire. For example, try draping towels over buckets to form tall, thin planters. After the planter dries, consider painting it before filling it with soil.
