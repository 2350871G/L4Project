They do require a dry, stable surface that doesn't hold water, but other than that, your imagination is the limit.For example, you can place air plants on a sunny windowsill or on a bookshelf near a light source. Positioning them inside glass terrariums or globes is a popular and attractive solution. You can also mount an air plant to a surface permanently with hot glue or super glue. If you don\u2019t want to use glue, tie the plants in place with fishing wire. Try mounting your air plant on a piece of driftwood or coral using hot glue to create a pretty display. Decide where you want to position the air plant on the chosen material, apply a small amount of hot glue to the area, and press the underside of the air plant clump into the glue. Hold the plant in place for 10-15 seconds so the glue can set."

Similarly, temperatures near windows can drop quickly in winter. If you live in a particularly hot or cold climate, you might want to mount a thermostat near the window so you can monitor the temperature.You could also download a free app to your smartphone to monitor temperature or use a digital temperature gun to take periodic readings.

Then, shake them gently to get rid of excess moisture and spread them upside-down on a clean towel so they can air-dry.If your mounted air plant can\u2019t be moved, mist it heavily with water until the leaves are dripping. Letting an air plant dry upside-down allows the water to drip away from the crown of the plant. Otherwise, water might settle into the crown and cause rot.
