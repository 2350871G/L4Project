Place the skillet over medium heat. It will take around 2-3 minutes for the butter to melt. If desired, you can use 2 tbsp (30 g) of butter and 0.125  c (30 ml) of olive oil. Add 12 frozen, pre-cooked pierogies to the pan. Carefully place the frozen pierogies in the pan one at a time so they don\u2019t cause the melted butter to splatter. You\u2019ll get about 12 pierogies in a standard 16 oz (450 g) package of frozen pierogies. If you are using uncooked frozen pierogies, you should boil them on the stove (until they float) or in the microwave (for 5 minutes), then pat them dry before adding them to the skillet. Put 0.75 c (180 g) each of sliced onions and mushrooms into the skillet.

If you don\u2019t care for mushrooms, you can use 1.5 c (360 g) of onions instead and omit the mushrooms. Cover the skillet for 2 minutes, then turn the pierogies. Place the lid on the skillet and allow the pierogies, onions, and mushrooms to cook for 2 minutes over medium heat. Then, lift off the lid, flip over all of the pierogies, and stir the onions and mushrooms a bit with your spatula. You should notice some slight browning on the pierogies at this point. Cook the pierogies for 2 more minutes in the covered skillet. Put the lid back on the skillet and let everything cook for another 2 minutes.
