The softener manual should instruct you on the ideal salt level. As a general rule, fill the tank at least half-full with salt, and keep it at least 3 inches (7.5 cm) above the water level. High salt levels (within 4 in/15 cm of the tank top) may improve efficiency, but reduce this to a lower level if you notice old salt clinging to the sides. If you use block salt, it may be best to have a technician raise your water level to submerge the block completely."
