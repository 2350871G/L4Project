Use kitchen cleaner to scrub the countertop free of all dirt, grime, oil, and grease. After you clean it, allow the countertop to completely dry before beginning the painting process. You can use a kitchen cleaner, or a combination of dish detergent and water, to clean your countertop. However, don\u2019t use an ammonia-based cleaning solution if your countertop is made of granite or laminate. If you want to take extra care in making your countertop ready to paint, you can also sand it with medium-grit sandpaper before you clean it. Your countertop probably won\u2019t need more than an hour to completely dry."
