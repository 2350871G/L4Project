Since protein powders are derived from different sources, choose one based on your own health needs. Consider using:\nWhey or casein protein powders, which are easy to digest and include all of the essential amino acids. Soy protein powder, which can boost bone density and reduce cholesterol. Plant-based proteins, which can be made from hemp, rice or peas are good gluten-free and vegan choices."

Don't cut back on the moisture or fat because your baked goods won't have as much flavor and they'll be tough or rubbery. Foods that add moisture include bananas, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, cooked sweet potatoes and beets, pumpkin puree, and applesauce.

Protein powder works well in quick breads, muffins, pancakes, granola bars, and cupcakes. Some recipes may specify which protein powder to use. If the recipe doesn't specify, use the protein powder that you're the most comfortable with using."

You can substitute the same type of protein powder, but avoid substituting a completely different type of protein. Specifically, don't use a whey or casein-based protein powder in a recipe that calls for a plant-based protein powder. If you're substituting a plant-based protein powder such as pea protein powder for another plant-based protein powder such as hemp powder, you can safely make substitutions."
