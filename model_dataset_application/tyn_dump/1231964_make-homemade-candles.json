          "description":"There are several different kinds of wax to choose from. One pound of paraffin wax by weight will equal approximately 20 oz of liquid melted wax. One pound of soy wax will equal approximately 18 oz of liquid when melted. One pound of beeswax by weight will equal approximately 16 oz of liquid when melted. Paraffin wax is the traditional wax for candle making and is still by far the most popular wax. It is good for beginners because it melts quickly, is cheap and is easily colored or scented. However, it should be noted that the chemicals that are emitted when this wax is melted could be irritating to some people. Soy wax is becoming increasingly popular as it is easy to use, made from soybeans and cleans up pretty easily. It is eco-friendly and renewable. Soy wax is also known to burn more slowly than most other waxes. Beeswax is all natural and has air purifying qualities to it; however, it doesn\u2019t retain scent or coloring that well. Essential oils will generally work with beeswax but keep in mind that beeswax has its own lovely scent. You can also use old candles that have been burned down or are half-used and warped. Using old candles is a great way to recycle wax. Simply melt them just as you would melt other wax (see Part Two)."
