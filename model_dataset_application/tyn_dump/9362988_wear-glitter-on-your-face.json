If you don't have petroleum jelly or if you don't want to use it, try clear lip balm or clear lip gloss instead. For a bolder look, use a Q-tip or thin makeup brush to apply the petroleum jelly to your crease. Flare it out in a wing-tip or cat eye. For a more subtle look, use a thin, liner brush to apply eyelash adhesive to your upper lash line. Do not apply it to your waterline, however."

Do not use regular glitter from the arts and crafts store. For a subtle look, try a neutral color, such as ivory, iridescent, peach, or gold. For a bold look, try an unnatural color, such as orange, red, blue, purple, etc. If you are already wearing eyeshadow, choose glitter in a similar color."
