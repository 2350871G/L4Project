    "When sprayed directly onto the pests, this pesticide also works against ants and roaches.",
    "If you do not have a fresh orange, use 1.5 tsp (7.4 g) of dried citrus peels or 1/2 oz (15 mL) of orange oil.",
    "Put the peels in a glass container and add 2 c (500 mL) of boiling water.",
    "Fill a kettle with 2 c (500 mL) of water and bring it to a boil.",
    "Pour the boiling water into the glass container and allow the solution to sit in a warm spot for about 24 hours.",
    "Strain the solution and save the citrus-infused water.",
    "Pour the mixture into a strainer, removing the peels and saving the water.",
    "You can then discard the peels or put them in your compost.",
    "Add a few drops of castile soap to the water.",
    "Peppermint-scented castile soap, such as Dr. Bronner's, may prove especially effective.",
    "Mix the solution thoroughly to combine the ingredients.",
    "Pour the pesticide into a large squirt bottle.",
    "Use a funnel to transfer the liquid into the bottle and replace the nozzle.",
    "Spray the entire plant with the solution to ward off most soft-bodied pests.",
    "Spray it directly on top of ants and roaches.",
    "Using Chrysanthemums Combine 1/2 c (113 g) of dried chrysanthemums with 4 c (1 L) of water.",
    "Chrysanthemums contain a chemical component called pyrethrum, which is capable of paralyzing many garden insects.",
    "Mix the dried petals and water together in a large stockpot.",
    "Boil the mixture for 20 minutes.",
    "Place the stockpot on your stove over high heat bring it to a boil.",
    "Boiling the mixture releases the pyrethrum into the water.",
    "Turn off the heat after 20 minutes.",
    "Pour the solution through a strainer.",
    "Remove the dried flowers and save the infused water.",
    "You can discard the dried flowers or place them in your compost.",
    "Pour the pesticide solution into a spray bottle and treat plants.",
    "Use a funnel to transfer the liquid to the bottle.",
    "Focus on spraying the most damaged areas before moving on to less damaged areas.",
    "Cover the entire plant with solution, including the undersides of leaves.",
    "Store the solution for up to 2 months.",
    "Keep the solution in a cool, dark place, like your cupboard.",
    "After 2 months, the solution may no longer be effective, so it's best to throw it out and make a new batch.",
    "Using Neem Combine 1/2 oz (15 mL) of neem oil with 1/2 tsp (2 1/2 mL) mild soap.",
    "Mix the 2 ingredients together in a bowl.",
    "You can get neem oil in most grocery and health food stores, as well as online.",
    "Use a mild soap like Dawn or castile soap for the best results.",
    "Neem oil, which comes from a bitter tree leaf, is thought to be one of the most effective natural pesticides in existence.",
    "Mix the neem and soap into 2 quarts (2 L) of warm water.",
    "Fill a large container with the water, then add the oil and soap mixture to it.",
    "Stir slowly until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed together.",
    "Pour the pesticide into a spray bottle.",
    "Transfer the solution to a spray bottle with a funnel.",
    "Spray the pesticide immediately, dousing the entire plant and focusing on spots where you can clearly see pests or signs of pests.",
    "Re-apply the pesticide regularly to prevent any infestation."
