If the leak is at the bottom of the aquarium, you will need to remove all water and aquarium rocks from the tank. If the leak is very low in the tank, you may have to move the fish and aquatic plants into a temporary container or other aquarium while repairs are made. Keep in mind that the sealant you seal the leak with will have to cure before refilling the tank, so plan accordingly to keep your fish and plants healthy."

If you didn't drain the entire aquarium because the leak in high up on the walls of the aquarium, be careful not to allow any of the old sealant to drop in the tank. Silicone sometimes does not bond well with old silicone. You may end up having to remove a lot of the silicone on the inside of the tank and then resealing all the seams at one time. If you are already draining, drying, and scraping silicone, you might as well do the whole thing."

Check with a professional aquarium supply for recommended repair products. Make sure that if you use silicone, it is labeled \"nontoxic\" and \"100% silicone\". Also make sure that the silicone sealant has NO fungicide in it and is a High Modulus product. You may be tempted to try and repair the leak from the outside of the tank, but usually the repair is more effective if made on the inside. A repair on the inside will hold better, since water pressure will \"tighten\" the seal pressing the silicone against the glass.

Try taping a paper towel to the outside of the tank where the leak was and leaving it there for an hour or so. If the towel remains dry, your leak is fixed.
