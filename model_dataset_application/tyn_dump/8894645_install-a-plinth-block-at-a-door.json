Score the edges of the casing where it meets the wall with a utility knife, then pry it up using a pry bar or putty knife. You can either replace the entire casing this way or carve out the lower section of the trim to make room for the blocks. If you choose to remove the casing completely, you\u2019ll need to replace it with new trim that lines up properly with the plinth blocks. Make your cuts carefully to ensure that the edges of the trim above the plinth block come out even."

In this case, your plinth blocks will be more like a facade, and probably only need to be cut about half as thick as they would be if you were embedding them into the casing. You'll have the most success installing plinth blocks over trim that's perfectly flat, without any grooves, contouring or other detailing that will make the blocks difficult to fit."

When the blocks are perfectly aligned and in the right position, slide them into the blank slots you cut into the casing. Keep applying pressure to the blocks until they\u2019re glued down securely. If you accidentally misalign the blocks on the first attempt, pull them off from the corner and try again with a fresh dab of adhesive."

Once you\u2019re satisfied with the position of your plinth blocks, nail them down gently. It may help to pre-drill the blocks with holes that match the size of the nails you\u2019ll be using. It\u2019s important that the nails be slightly recessed so that you\u2019ll have room to plug them later. Nail into the solid framing behind the trim whenever possible. This will provide greater security and keep the blocks from coming loose."

Fill in the nail holes with a small amount of caulk or spackling, then brush on a coat of primer before painting the blocks to match the trim. Enjoy the sophisticated look of your new molding! Sand the spackling after it dries to make the surface of the blocks smooth and level. Applying a few strips of painter\u2019s tape to the wall around the door jamb will allow you to work your brush all the way into the edges of the blocks."
