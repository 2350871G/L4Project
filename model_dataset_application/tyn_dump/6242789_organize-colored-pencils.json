Then, put another \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) piece of tape on the outer side of the jars. Stagger another 2 jars in between the first 3 so they are all in a bunch. Then, lift up the jars and place them on their side to easily access the tops. After you sort through your pencils, place them into each of the jars, based on your organizational method. Mason jars are a great option to keep on your craft desk at home. You can do this with 3 jars or 7 jars if you prefer. Using an odd number of jars helps create an attractive display."

Place your pencils inside each section, and then roll up your pencil wrap starting at the side without a clasp. Then, secure your pencil wrap with the snap or tie. The size, shape, and design depend on the particular model, but you can usually fit at least 40 colored pencils in 1 pouch. This is a great idea if you want to take your pencils with you while traveling."

Sort through your pencils, then place each color family inside its own plastic container. Using plastic storage options is also a waterproof solution. For instance, use these if you want to color while sunbathing at the beach or laying by the pool. You can use more or less plastic containers, depending on your pencil collection."

Place 1 pencil in each hole, and arrange them by color for a neat, presentable option. Place your pencil stand on your desk or bedside table if you tend to color very regularly. This way, you can easily access all of your favorite hues. These typically hold around 25-30 pencils at a time."

Use one of these to keep your colored pencils organized if you want to easily view all of your options. You can group each color into its own unit, or spread the colors out based on how frequently you use them. This is a nice option because they usually have other smaller sections, so you can keep your sharpener or erasers nearby too. You can hold 30-80 pencils, based on the size of your carousel."

Most cases have between 50-100 elastic spots, so you can contain many pencils in 1 place. In addition, pencil cases often have elastic spots for your erasers and blending tools. This is the most secure and professional-looking storage option."
