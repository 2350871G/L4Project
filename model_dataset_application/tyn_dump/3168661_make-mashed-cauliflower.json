Instead of using a microwave-safe bowl, you could also use a microwave-safe glass casserole dish that already has a lid. Do not use plastic wrap if you are using a lid. Avoid lids that create an air-proof seal. If the lid to your dish creates a tight seal, leave the lid slightly askew on the top of the container to allow the contents of the dish room to vent."
