Spread the saw horses out in your workspace, letting the board rest over them. Make sure the part of the board you wish to cut is accessible, then hammer a pair of 1.5 in (3.8 cm) nails into the opposite end. Along with the wood and any other supplies needed, you can buy saw horses at most home improvement and tool stores. If you don\u2019t have saw horses, you can use a workbench or another flat surface.

    "Make sure the top and side edges are square before fastening the boards together.",
    "Countersink holes in the boards and screw them together.",
    "Screwing the boards this way keeps them level and secure.",
    "To start, wrap tape 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) above the end of a power drill.",
    "Drill down through the boards no further than the tape.",
    "Then, drill down again into the center of the pilot holes with a 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) drill bit before adding 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) flat-head wood screws.",
    "Make the holes about every 3 \u20442 in (8.9 cm) along the edge of the fence board.",
    "Position the screws about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) away from the edge.",
    "The second hole you drill will be wider than the pilot holes, providing a stable fit for the screws.",
    "Mark the board you wish to cut.",
    "Now that your jig is done, you can use it to make a straight cross cut on any board.",
    "Place the board on a flat surface, then use a square to measure out where you need to make the cut.",
    "Make pencil marks to indicate the beginning and end of the cut.",
    "You don\u2019t need to draw an entire guideline.",
    "Raise the board with scrap wood as needed to keep the saw from cutting into your work surface.",
    "Position the jig and cut the board with a circular saw.",
    "The thin stop board is meant to rest along the side of the board.",
    "The fence board will rest on the marks you made when measuring the cut.",
    "Place the circular saw so its blade is right up against the fence.",
    "Then, operate the saw as normal to slice the wood.",
    "Hold the jig and board in place to prevent them from moving while you operate the saw."
