          "description":"The Salmon Ladder has 2 main components\u20142 wooden posts and a series of angled rungs which you\u2019ll use to catch and stabilize the bar. For this project, a pair of sturdy 12\u2019-15\u2019 (3.7-4.6 m) 4x4 posts will serve as the vertical supports, with a 2x6 across the top to connect the frame. The rungs themselves will be fashioned from a 2x4 sawed to the appropriate size and shape. Depending on the spacing between the rungs, two 8 foot (2.4 m) (2.4 m) long 2x4's may be needed instead of one 12 foot (3.7 m) 2x4. Use only high-quality pressure-treated lumber. Since it\u2019s made to withstand heavier loads, you can be sure that it will hold up under hours and hours of intense training. In addition to the raw lumber, you\u2019ll also need a hammer or electric drill, 3\u201d (7.6 cm) nails or heavy-duty wood screws, a handsaw, a bag of quickset concrete, and a tape measure."

          "description":"Use a post hole digger to clear the soil by hand quickly and ensure that the holes are uniform. Each hole should be approximately 4 feet (1.2 m) deep and 1 foot (0.30 m) across. Space them roughly 42\u201d (1 m) apart in order to leave a comfortable amount of distance to maneuver between the posts. A flat, stable patch of ground with plenty of room to move around will make the best site for your Salmon Ladder. It's also a good idea to position your Salmon Ladder where you can attach other supports. This could mean resting it against a tree or adding additional supports at the top. The length of the 4x4 posts will correspond to the total height of the obstacle. For a standard 11\u2019-12\u2019 (3.4-3.7 m) ladder, you\u2019ll need to have your posts cut to 15\u2019-17\u2019 (4.6-5 m)."

A good way to determine where to put the lowest rungs is to reach up along the frame with one hand (without stretching too far) and draw a line on the side of the post. Measure and mark each set separately and use a flat board or straight edge to make sure they\u2019re evenly aligned. 12\u201d (30 cm) rung spacing is the official standard used for the American Ninja Warrior course, but yours can be more or less as you see fit.
