The extra layer will act as a barrier to protect your floor against spills and splatters. Paint fumes can quickly become overpowering. For this reason, it\u2019s recommended that you do your painting in a garage or workshop that will provide some ventilation, or in an outdoor space like a patio or driveway. Use strips of tape or heavy objects like paint buckets to hold down the corners of the dropcloth and keep it from blowing around in a stiff breeze."

          "description":"Use a square of 80-100 grit sandpaper to gently scuff the entire outer surface. This will remove the existing finish so that the dresser will have an easier time accepting fresh paint. Sand with smooth, circular rubbing motions to avoid leaving noticeable streaks in the grain. Make sure you give the edges, corners, and any recessed or molded bits some attention, as well. Bearing down too hard with the sandpaper may damage the wood underneath."

A spray-on primer will also do the trick if you\u2019d prefer not to go to the trouble of detailing by hand. There are both oil and water-based primers, just as there are oil and water-based paints. Be sure to choose a primer with the same basic formula as the paint you'll be using."

Opening a couple doors or windows or setting up a portable fan in front of the piece can help with this. Come back periodically and give the primer a tough-test to see how it\u2019s coming along. If it feels sticky, it still needs more time. Painting over wet primer can smudge the base coat, leaving behind white swirls in your new color."
