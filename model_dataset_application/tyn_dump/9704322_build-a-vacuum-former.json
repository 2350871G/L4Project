Cut along the inner squares on all three frame pieces.  Cut along the outer guidelines to finish each frame piece.  Build the main box by stacking and gluing the three frame pieces together.  Clamp all four sides of the box and allow the glue to dry.  Drill a hole on one side using the hole saw so the vacuum hose (or adapter) will fit snugly.  Making the Platen Measure and draw outside frame. On the 5mm MDF, draw a 5 inch square. Measure and draw a grid. Start in from a corner at 0.5 inches from each side, draw straight vertical lines every 2/3 inches for a total of 7 lines. Repeat the pattern for horizontal lines creating an intersecting grid pattern. Drill 3/32 inch holes at each intersection.  Cut the final platen out of the MDF along the outside frame lines drawn earlier.  Glue the platen to the top of the former box created in the previous step, clamping all four sides until the glue dries.  Making the Bottom \\/ Mount Measure and draw cutting guidelines. On the 5mm MDF, draw a 5 inch by 9 inch rectangle. Cut frame from MDF.  Glue this final piece to the bottom of the vacuum former box, clamping the two flush sides until the it is fully dried.  Making the Sheet Holder Frame Measure and draw guidelines. On the 5mm MDF, draw two 7.5 inch squares\nCentered inside each square draw another, 5.5 inch square.
