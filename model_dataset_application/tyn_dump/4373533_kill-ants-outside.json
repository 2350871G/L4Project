          "description":"Mix 0.8 fluid ounces (24 mL) of the pesticide per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a pump sprayer and cover each anthill in your yard. It may not kill the ants right away, but they should be mostly controlled within 1 week. Non-repellent pesticides create a barrier that ants pass through so that they bring the poison back to the nest. Pay attention to where ants are coming from in your yard. They could be near your house, along a fence, or in the cracks of your pavement. Look for small mounds of dirt to find the ant nests. Limit spreading pesticides to every 6 months."

Hold the tip of the garden sprayer 6 inches (15 cm) above the ground and spray in the corner and  1 foot (0.30 m) up onto your foundation. Spray around wire boxes, pipe connections, and any other areas you may have noticed ants entering and exiting your home. Spray around windows and door frames as well. Apply the pesticides on a day when it isn\u2019t windy so they do not blow away from the area you\u2019re targeting."

          "description":"Granular pesticides contain poison and the ants will carry it deep into their nest thinking that it\u2019s food. Pour the bag of granular pesticide into a garden spreader and walk it across your lawn. The spreader will throw the pesticide across your lawn for maximum coverage. Some bags of granular pesticides have built-in shakers so you can spread it in concentrated areas. Keep pets and children inside for at least 1 hour so the pesticide has a chance to dry. Mow your lawn right before you spread the pesticide so it reaches the ground."

Bait traps have granules that attract ants and contain poison that will kill ants as it\u2019s digested. After 1 month, dispose of your old traps. Some bait traps have a strong-scented liquid to attract ants and will trap them inside. These may take a few weeks to notice results. Bait traps can be purchased at your local home and garden store."

The heat along with the soap will kill the ants and prevent them from escaping their nests. Pour the solution into a spray bottle for a more controlled method of dispersing the water. Pour the water into the nest in the early morning or late at night when most of the ants are inside. Boiling or hot water could damage nearby plants, so use caution when pouring around plants you want to keep."

Use 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of boric acid with 1 cup (201 g) of sugar mixed with 3 cups (710 ml) of warm water to create a sweet mixture that attracts the ants. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle and spray the nests along with any ant trails you notice in your yard or around your home. Within the next couple days, you\u2019ll notice results. Boric acid is toxic to humans and animals if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Never use it in an area where you prepare food, and wear gloves and a face mask to protect yourself while using it. Rinse away any excess boric acid to clean it from the area."

For preventative measures, sprinkle it around the perimeter of your house to keep ants outside. Diatomaceous earth dries the liquids inside the ants and will kill them within a few days or weeks. Wear a dust mask so you don\u2019t inhale the DE while you spread it. DE is safe to keep in your yard around children and pets."

Let the orange peels steep in the water overnight before transferring the mixture to a spray bottle. Shake the bottle to mix the solution and spray the nests with it. This method drives ants away rather than killing them. Use a blender to combine the orange peel with the water and vinegar to make a thicker solution that may kill some ants on contact."
