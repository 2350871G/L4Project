This will be the rear of the lion so make it about 3/4 the size of the large circle. Sketch your guiding circles lightly so you can go back and erase lines as needed."

          "headline":"Draw an egg-shape with guidelines above the large circle to make the head.",
          "description":"Position the wider end of the egg-shape above the big circle and leave a space that's as big as you want the lion's neck to be. Then, make facial guidelines. Lightly draw a horizontal and vertical line that cross through the head. Then, draw a small curve in the top quadrant, which will be the ear. The top quadrant is the highest quarter in the wider end of the head. Taper the egg shape down to become the lion's muzzle. If you feel comfortable drawing the facial features, you don't need to draw the guidelines."

For the front leg, draw a line that curves slightly to the right. There's no need to draw 4 lines because 1 of the lion's legs will be hidden by the leg that's next to it."

          "headline":"Connect the 3 circles and make the outline of the tail on the small circle.",
          "description":"To make your outline look more like a lion, draw a line that connects the top of the circles with the head. To make the outline realistic, make the line dip down towards the chest. Then, draw a line across the bottom of the circles that curves up to the right. Connect this line to the tapered end of the head. To make the tail, draw a line coming out of the small circle that curves in an \"S\" shape. You now have a basic outline for the lion."

For the nose, draw an upside-down triangle at the tapered end of the head. You can make the eye and nose as detailed or simplistic as you like."

Then, make a handful of dots right below the nose and draw 4 or 5 light whiskers extending away from the nose.Tip: To make the lion's chin look more realistic, make the space underneath the muzzle jut out a little so it's more pointed than round."

Draw the mane so it frames the lion's face and covers the lion's chest. Sketch a rough line to connect the mane from the top of the back to the front of the chest. To draw a female lion, skip this step. Think about how the hair falls around the lion's face and make the hair near the top of the head point up more before it curves down to the side. Make the hairs near the bottom of the mane vertical since they're hanging."

Sketch 3 half-circles in a horizontal line at the base of the foot to create a paw. Then, go back and sketch short, quick lines that look like shaggy hairs coming off of the legs. Remember that 1 of the front legs won't be visible so you don't need to draw it."

Drawing a Cartoon Lion Draw a circle for the lion's head and make 2 half-circles for ears. Sketch a circle that's as large as you want the lion's head to be.

Create a scalloped edge around the lion's entire head. To make a large mane, leave a wide gap between the mane and the face. Skip this step if you're drawing a female lion. Draw the lion's legs if you want to show it sitting on its haunches. Sketch 2 lines from the bottom of the mane that curve down towards the center.
