          "description":"Buy or make your own tassels using thread and determine how many you want to attach. You can use any size of tassels, but you'll probably want to use lots of tassels if they're shorter than 1 inch (2.5 cm). Start with at least a few dozen and decide if you'd like more tassels on the hemline. Unlike fringe, tassels are sold individually so the package size will vary. Use tassels of the same color for a monochromatic look or pick a variety of colors that complement the fabric. For example, to make a white dress bright, use tassels with bold colors, such as red, pink, yellow, and green. If you're adding tassels to a neutral-colored fabric, use white, black, or gray tassels."

Put the tassels next to each other and leave as much space between them as you like.

To secure the thread, insert the needle through the gathered end of the tassel and pull. This prevents the thread from slipping out of the needle.Tip: If your tassels don't have a tail, tie a 6 in (15 cm) piece of thread onto the loop at the end of your tassel."

Double this measurement to determine how much fringe you'd need to apply 1 row of fringe. Then, multiply that number by how many rows you'll sew onto the dress. For example, if your dress measures 15 inches (38 cm) across and you want 5 rows of fringe, double the measurement to get 30 inches (76 cm). Multiply 5 rows by 30 inches (76 cm) to get 12 \u20442 feet (3.8 m). The amount of fringe you need to buy depends on your dress size and how much of the dress you want to cover with fringe. In general, plan on using 1 to 2 yards (0.91 to 1.83 m) of fringe per row."

Check the package to see if the heading is stretchy or not and choose the style based on your dress's fabric. Most fringe dresses use fringe that matches, but you can choose fringe that stands out.

Keep placing rows of fringe until you've covered as much of the dress as you want. For a flapper-style dress, arrange rows of fringe over the entire surface of the dress.
