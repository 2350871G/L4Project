  "text":" Making the dough Place the flour, salt, and water into a mixing bowl.  Stir the ingredients together using the mixing spoon.  Sprinkle flour over your work surface so the mixture doesn't stick when kneading.  Knead the dough. When the dough forms a ball during mixing, take it out of the bowl. Place it on the floured surface and knead it for 5 minutes. Knead until it is smooth and not sticky to handle. Shaping the basket Prepare the oven proof bowl that will form the mold for the basket. Cover it completely with aluminum (kitchen) foil. Roll the dough out on another flour-covered platform.  Cut the flattened dough into 1 inch (2.5cm) wide strips. These strips will be used to form the dough basket. Weave the strips on top of the bowl. Line them across the bowl one way, then weave in the remaining pieces up and over the already added pieces. For any leftover pieces, just tuck them underneath the lip of the bowl and press in firmly to create a smooth join. Baking the basket Bake the basket. Bake for 4 hours at 275 \u00b0F (135 \u00b0C), or until it is completely dried up and hardened. Remove the baked basket. When the bowl is baked sufficiently, take it out of the oven.
