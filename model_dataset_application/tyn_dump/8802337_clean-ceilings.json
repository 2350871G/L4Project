Depending on the type of vacuum you have, you may be able to vacuum a substantial amount of debris before doing anything else. Use a bristle-brush attachment or another attachment intended for easily-scratched surfaces. Extend the telescoping shaft of your vacuum, if you have one. Pay special attention to corners, where crown molding meets the ceiling, and areas around air vents."

You may need to clean or dust your duster if the ceiling is exceptionally dirty. It might help if you vacuum the duster a couple of times while cleaning the ceiling. A microfiber attachment on your duster will pick up more dust and is less likely to scratch your ceiling."

Avoid applying too much pressure so as not to rub dirt or dust into the ceiling. Get a new cloth once the one you are using is dirty. If you can't reach the ceiling, use a chair, ladder, or take a broom and fix your microfiber cloth to the end of it."
