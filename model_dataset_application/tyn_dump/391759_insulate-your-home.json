          "description":"The R-value of insulation refers to the insulating power, or thermal resistance, of the insulation you\u2019re buying. The higher the number is for the R-value, the more effective the insulation will be. The R-value you need depends on your climate, the type of heating and cooling system you have, and which part of the house you want to insulate. Look at an online guide or ask an employee at a hardware store to help you determine which insulation you need for your home. For insulating walls, you usually need insulation that\u2019s R-13. Attics tend to need anywhere between R-30 and R-49 insulation. Basements usually require a rating between R-11 and R-25. If you want to insulate your floor, use R-12 to R-30 insulation depending on your climate zone."

          "description":"Measure the length and height of the wall and multiply them together to find the area of the wall. Then measure the distance between 2 of the vertical studs on the wall so you know how wide your insulation needs to be. The stud distance is usually 16 or 24 inches (41 or 61 cm) apart. If you\u2019re insulating an attic, measure the length and width of the attic\u2019s floor instead. Rather than measuring the distance for the wall studs, find the length between 2 of the floor joists."

Insulated foam boards are large panels that work best for foundation walls, floors, and ceilings. Choose insulation that has the R-value your home requires, and check the packaging to find out how much area a single piece covers so you can get enough for the entire area you\u2019re insulating. You can buy insulation from home improvement stores or online.
