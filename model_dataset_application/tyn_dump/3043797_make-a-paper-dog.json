The bigger the sheet of paper, the bigger your dog will be. Brown, tan, or white are common dog colors, but don\u2019t hesitate to choose something more unconventional for your origami creation. If you don\u2019t have origami paper, use something else that is thin and easy to fold, like newspaper, magazine pages, or even wrapping paper. Cut the substitute into the right dimensions so you have a perfectly square piece of paper."

The larger the piece of paper you choose, the bigger the dog head will be. Choose a color for your dog, whether that is brown, black, white, tan, or an unconventional color, like blue or green. If you don\u2019t have origami paper, cut a thin sheet of paper, like newspaper or wrapping paper, into a square. Fold the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner to make a triangle. Match up the 2 corners so that the sides are equal. Press the fold down firmly to create a crease. To help crease the paper, push the fold down with the back of your nail or with the body of a pen. The stronger the crease, the better definition your dog head will have. Bring the 2 bottom corners together to make a smaller triangle. Leave your first fold in place. Bring the bottom points together and make another fold to form a smaller triangle. Take your time when making your folds and line up the edges neatly. Unfold the triangle once, and place it so the tip is pointing at your body. Undo the last fold you did so that just the large triangle is left. Position the paper so that the top of the triangle is pointing at you. You\u2019ll use the center crease as a guide for your future folds. Make a diagonal fold on the right-hand side, starting at the center crease. Make a bigger fold for bigger dog ears or a smaller fold for smaller ears. Make the crease start at the center line and fold the right-side corner down at a diagonal angle. Keep the fold lined up with the center crease to create a proportional face. Repeat the previous step on the opposite side. Try your best to create the same angle so that your dog\u2019s ears are the same size. Start the diagonal fold at the center-crease line. When you look down at your paper, you should see a very angular-looking dog head. Fold back the bottom and top points to create straight lines. Fold back the top tip of the dog\u2019s head just enough so that there is a flat line connecting the 2 ears. Fold the bottom tip back to create a jaw line for the dog. If you need to, use a little bit of glue or double-sided tape to secure the points to the back of the dog\u2019s head. Draw the rest of the dog\u2019s features to complete your project. Use a black marker to draw eyes, a nose, and a mouth on the paper. You can get as detailed as you want to, but for basic features, make circles for eyes and an upside-down triangle for the nose. For the mouth, make a \u201cJ\u201d attached to a backwards \u201cJ\u201d coming out of the tip of the dog\u2019s nose. You can get as creative as you\u2019d like with designing the dog\u2019s face. Try making spots on the ears or giving it whiskers or a tongue. Making a Hand Puppet Fold a piece of paper lengthwise into 3 equal sections. Use a piece of construction paper or computer paper, or anything that comes close in size to 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm). This piece of paper will be the dog\u2019s head, so use whatever color you\u2019d like for that. White works well, but brown, black, or even an unconventional color, like red, would be fine. Avoid using really thin paper for this craft. You\u2019ll be sticking your hands into the folds, so it needs to be a little thicker to hold up. Glue the last fold down with your glue stick. To help your craft stay together, apply some glue to the back of the last fold. Press it down so it adheres to the other side. Glue sticks work great because they don\u2019t take long to dry. If you don\u2019t have a glue stick, try using double-sided tape. Fold the paper in half so the \u201cseam\u201d is on the outside. Bring the short ends of the paper together, making a crease in the middle. Fold the paper so that the side you just glued is facing up. If you accidentally fold it the wrong way the first time, that\u2019s okay. Just unfold it and reverse the direction. Fold the open edge to the bottom crease on each side. On each side of the paper, take the top edge and fold it back so it\u2019s in line with the bottom, and make a crease. After you\u2019ve done this on each side, hold up the paper and check that it makes an \u201cM.\u201d\nThe top and bottom sections are where you\u2019ll place your fingers to make the puppet talk. Cut out the dog\u2019s ears and tongue and glue them into place. Use different colors of construction paper to cut out oblong shapes for the ears and tongue. Use your glue stick to attach them to the paper. Place the tongue inside the \u201cmouth\u201d and glue the ears on the top of the paper, one on each side of the head. For example, if you used white paper for the dog\u2019s head, use red paper for the tongue and black paper for the ears. Draw on the eyes and nose to complete your puppet. Use a black marker to draw circles for eyes and an upside down triangle for the nose. You could even put 3 small dots on either side of the nose to make whiskers. Use your imagination and enjoy the decoration process! To use the hand puppet, simply put your thumb in the bottom flap and your fingers in the top flap.

    "Leave the flap folded to the center point.",
    "Take the tip of the corner that is in the center, and fold it back about 2/3rds of the way.",
    "Make your crease so that the top forms a triangle that overhangs the outer edge of the square.",
    "Leave the top and bottom flaps in place and don\u2019t do anything to them at this point.",
    "This fold will eventually become the dog\u2019s tail.",
    "Fold the entire square in half lengthwise.",
    "Pick up the piece of paper.",
    "Fold it in half evenly, lengthwise, to create the left and right sides of your origami dog.",
    "When the fold is done, set the paper down in front of you so that the pointy tail is pointing to the right.",
    "Take your time when lining up the center fold.",
    "If the lines aren\u2019t straight, your dog will be wobbly.",
    "Unfold the top flap and crease it from the top-left to bottom-right corner.",
    "Unfold the flap of paper from the top section of the dog so that its point is pointing toward your body.",
    "Then fold the entire section of paper up, and create a diagonal fold that starts at the top-left corner and finishes at the bottom-right corner.",
    "At this point in the folding process, you\u2019re making the dog\u2019s head and legs.",
    "Refold the right edge along the crease line.",
    "After making the diagonal fold, take the point of the piece of paper you just folded up, and bring it back down along the original crease line.",
    "This creates the slant of the dog\u2019s \u201cleg.\u201d\nThe bottom edge should be in line with the ground if you were to pretend to stand it up.",
    "Repeat the previous 2 steps on the opposite side.",
    "Flip the piece of paper over.",
    "Unfold the flap of paper and make a diagonal fold from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner.",
    "Then fold the paper back down along its original crease line to form the other leg.",
    "Even though you\u2019re nearing the end, remember to take your time and make your folds as straight and defined as you can.",
    "Pull out the fold inside the dog\u2019s \u201cnose.\u201d When you look at the piece of paper, you should now see the dog\u2019s tail, body, triangle legs, and triangle head.",
    "Look under the dog\u2019s nose and carefully pull out the fold.",
    "This creates the dog\u2019s mouth and gives it a more realistic look.",
    "The crease line creates a jawline for the dog.",
    "Draw a nose and eyes onto the dog to complete it.",
    "Take a marker and put an eye on each side of the dog, as well as a nose.",
    "For the nose, just fill in the area around the front tip of the head.",
    "You could also draw a little smile or any other embellishments you feel are appropriate.",
    "Once you get the hang of the pattern, you can make an origami dog in just a few minutes.",
    "Creating a Dog Head Choose a piece of origami paper for your project.",
    "Origami-specific paper comes in squares, which means it\u2019s ready to use and you don\u2019t need to cut it at all.",
    "The larger the piece of paper you choose, the bigger the dog head will be.",
    "Choose a color for your dog, whether that is brown, black, white, tan, or an unconventional color, like blue or green.",
    "If you don\u2019t have origami paper, cut a thin sheet of paper, like newspaper or wrapping paper, into a square.",
    "Fold the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner to make a triangle.",
    "Match up the 2 corners so that the sides are equal.",
    "Press the fold down firmly to create a crease.",
    "To help crease the paper, push the fold down with the back of your nail or with the body of a pen.",
    "The stronger the crease, the better definition your dog head will have.",
    "Bring the 2 bottom corners together to make a smaller triangle.",
    "Leave your first fold in place.",
    "Bring the bottom points together and make another fold to form a smaller triangle.",
    "Take your time when making your folds and line up the edges neatly.",
    "Unfold the triangle once, and place it so the tip is pointing at your body.",
    "Undo the last fold you did so that just the large triangle is left.",
    "Position the paper so that the top of the triangle is pointing at you.",
    "You\u2019ll use the center crease as a guide for your future folds.",
    "Make a diagonal fold on the right-hand side, starting at the center crease.",
    "Make a bigger fold for bigger dog ears or a smaller fold for smaller ears.",
    "Make the crease start at the center line and fold the right-side corner down at a diagonal angle.",
    "Keep the fold lined up with the center crease to create a proportional face.",
    "Repeat the previous step on the opposite side.",
    "Try your best to create the same angle so that your dog\u2019s ears are the same size.",
    "Start the diagonal fold at the center-crease line.",
    "When you look down at your paper, you should see a very angular-looking dog head.",
    "Fold back the bottom and top points to create straight lines.",
    "Fold back the top tip of the dog\u2019s head just enough so that there is a flat line connecting the 2 ears.",
    "Fold the bottom tip back to create a jaw line for the dog.",
    "If you need to, use a little bit of glue or double-sided tape to secure the points to the back of the dog\u2019s head.",
    "Draw the rest of the dog\u2019s features to complete your project.",
    "Use a black marker to draw eyes, a nose, and a mouth on the paper.",
    "You can get as detailed as you want to, but for basic features, make circles for eyes and an upside-down triangle for the nose.",
    "For the mouth, make a \u201cJ\u201d attached to a backwards \u201cJ\u201d coming out of the tip of the dog\u2019s nose.",
    "You can get as creative as you\u2019d like with designing the dog\u2019s face.",
    "Try making spots on the ears or giving it whiskers or a tongue.",
    "Making a Hand Puppet Fold a piece of paper lengthwise into 3 equal sections.",
    "Use a piece of construction paper or computer paper, or anything that comes close in size to 8.5 by 11 in (22 by 28 cm).",
    "This piece of paper will be the dog\u2019s head, so use whatever color you\u2019d like for that.",
    "White works well, but brown, black, or even an unconventional color, like red, would be fine.",
    "Avoid using really thin paper for this craft.",
    "You\u2019ll be sticking your hands into the folds, so it needs to be a little thicker to hold up.",
    "Glue the last fold down with your glue stick.",
    "To help your craft stay together, apply some glue to the back of the last fold.",
    "Press it down so it adheres to the other side.",
    "Glue sticks work great because they don\u2019t take long to dry.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a glue stick, try using double-sided tape.",
    "Fold the paper in half so the \u201cseam\u201d is on the outside.",
    "Bring the short ends of the paper together, making a crease in the middle.",
    "Fold the paper so that the side you just glued is facing up.",
    "If you accidentally fold it the wrong way the first time, that\u2019s okay.",
    "Just unfold it and reverse the direction.",
    "Fold the open edge to the bottom crease on each side.",
    "On each side of the paper, take the top edge and fold it back so it\u2019s in line with the bottom, and make a crease.",
    "After you\u2019ve done this on each side, hold up the paper and check that it makes an \u201cM.\u201d\nThe top and bottom sections are where you\u2019ll place your fingers to make the puppet talk.",
    "Cut out the dog\u2019s ears and tongue and glue them into place.",
    "Use different colors of construction paper to cut out oblong shapes for the ears and tongue.",
    "Use your glue stick to attach them to the paper.",
    "Place the tongue inside the \u201cmouth\u201d and glue the ears on the top of the paper, one on each side of the head.",
    "For example, if you used white paper for the dog\u2019s head, use red paper for the tongue and black paper for the ears.",
    "Draw on the eyes and nose to complete your puppet.",
    "Use a black marker to draw circles for eyes and an upside down triangle for the nose.",
    "You could even put 3 small dots on either side of the nose to make whiskers.",
    "Use your imagination and enjoy the decoration process!",
    "To use the hand puppet, simply put your thumb in the bottom flap and your fingers in the top flap.",
    "When you open and close your hand, the dog\u2019s mouth will open and close, too."
