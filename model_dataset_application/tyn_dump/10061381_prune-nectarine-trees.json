Pruning vertical branches helps to encourage vegetative growth, pruning horizontal ones helps to encourage fruiting growth.Leave small horizontal branches intact for future fruiting growth, but cut longer ones to prevent short-term fruiting.

Gumming is hardened sap that oozes from lesions or cankers on the tree. It is an early indication of disease. Cut out any branches showing signs of gumming by making a 45\u00b0 angle cut at the branch collar. If you mow around the tree, be careful not to nick the leader. Gumming occurs at the site of open wounds on the tree, and gumming on the leader can be hard to remove. Cut out suckers that grow near the bottom of the trunk. Suckers are small branches underneath the main branch system of the tree. Cut suckers back to the branch collar at a 45\u00b0 angle using your pruning shears. Suckers sap nutrients from the fruit-bearing branches at the top. Over time, they can keep your tree from fruiting. Trim branches that bend downwards. Prune such branches back to the point at which they trend downwards to encourage horizontal growth. Downward trending branches will eventually produce less fruit and become less vigorous over time.",
