Set a large bowl of ice water on the counter next to the stove. You'll also need a small bowl of water, a pastry brush, and a candy thermometer. Make sure the saucepan will be able to fit inside the bowl with ice water."

Try not to get any of the granulated sugar on the sides of the saucepan since this can make the mixture crystallize. It may help to pour the granulated sugar directly into the center of the saucepan."

Avoid stirring the mixture while it cooks or it may crystallize and become grainy. The mixture will bubble and begin to darken a little. Keep cooking until a candy thermometer reads 293 degrees F (145 degrees C). To prevent crystallization, dip your pastry brush in some water and wipe down the sides of the saucepan. Take extra care not to burn yourself with the hot sugar."

Use hot pads to carefully lift the saucepan off of the stove and plunge the bottom of the pot directly into the bowl of ice water. Keep the saucepan on the ice water for 5 seconds. This should bring the temperature of your sugar syrup down to around 275 degrees F (135 degrees C)."

Wave the fork over the bowl so that the syrup strands begin to cover the bowl and drape over the sides. Keep spinning the sugar until the cage is as thick and even as you'd like it. You'll need to be careful when handling the hot syrup, but work quickly. If the syrup in the bowl hardens too much, simply microwave it briefly so that it becomes syrupy again."

To clean up the look of your sugar cage, trip the edges of the bowl. Take a sharp chef's knife and trim along the edges of the bowl. To strengthen the sugar cage and make it easier to remove, you'll need to let the sugar cage set up for about 5 minutes."

Place your thumbs on the outside of the bowl and rest your other fingers on the inside so they're touching the sugar cage. Gently apply pressure so you can pull the cage up and away. If it seems like your sugar cage may break, move your hands and fingers to another point along the bowl. Applying even pressure can prevent the cage from breaking as you remove it."

If it begins to do this, place it back into the bowl so that it keeps its shape while it hardens."
