          "description":"Strawberries are rarely grown from seed in home environments. Typically, you will grow strawberries from a small starter plant or from a cutting from another strawberry plant, known as a runner. Both can be easily transplanted into pots using the same methods. Runners are often cheaper than starter plants, but some may require special care, such as soaking or refrigeration. Follow the instructions from your nursery if this is the case. Day-neutral plants (which produce multiple small harvests) or everbearing plants (which produce 2 harvests a year) are ideal for growing in containers. While June-bearing plants can be grown, they will only produce 1 large harvest a year and often do better when grown in a garden."

Wind can dry out the soil and knock the pots over, damaging your strawberries. If it gets windy where you live, keep the pots against a fence, deck, or shed. Alternatively, place stakes around the pot to keep it in place. Give the plant liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks in the spring and summer. Potted strawberries often require fertilizer because they cannot get nutrients as easily from the soil. Use a 10-10-10 fertilizer or use a special mix, such as a liquid tomato feed. Follow the instructions on the label for fertilizing your plant. Use insecticides to kill pests. If you notice holes on your leaves, discolored leaves, or nibbled berries, you may have pests eating on your berries. Insecticidal soaps or products containing neem are effective against caterpillars, thrips, and beetles. Follow the instructions on the label before using.

Watering the base of the plant and not the leaves can help prevent fungus from growing. Remove any leaves with fungus to prevent it from spreading to other parts of the plant. Move the strawberry plants indoors in the winter. If you kept your strawberries outdoors, make sure to bring them in before the first frost.

This will ensure that they get enough sun during this time. Keep the containers in an unheated garage, basement, or room. You only need to water the plant once every 1-2 weeks. Encouraging a Harvest Remove the flowers that appear in the first year. Pluck or cut these flowers off to skip the first harvest and produce a stronger second harvest. If you have a day-neutral or everbearing variety, remove flowers until the end of June to get a harvest in the fall. If you have a June-bearing variety, remove all flowers in the first year.
