          "description":"The cosmopolitan is one of the most popular cocktails in the world. It has a tart cranberry flavor, and uses Cointreau as a central ingredient. Begin by mixing 1.5 ounces of vodka, 0.5 ounces of cranberry juice, 0.75 ounces of Cointreau, and a splash of lime juice in a cocktail shaker with a few ice cubes. Shake it until it is chilled, and strain the mixture into a glass using a cocktail strainer. Add a lime slice as a garnish. You can measure ingredients using a measuring cup, but most bartenders and cocktail aficionados will use a jigger\u2014a double sided metal cylinder used to measure out ingredients. Jiggers are preferred because each side measures ounces in different increments, but they are by no means essential."

          "description":"The margarita is a refreshing and popular drink that uses tequila as its base. Start off by combining 1 ounce of Cointreau in a shaker with 2 ounces of blanco tequila and 1 ounce of fresh lime juice. Shake the ingredients in a shaker with ice until you\u2019ve reached the desired temperature and strain the mixture in to a rocks glass. Garnish the drink with a lime wheel. Most restaurants and bars serve margaritas in a specialty margarita glass. However, it is not uncommon to see margaritas served in an Old Fashioned or pint glass. Margaritas are often served in salt-rimmed glasses. To rim your glass with salt, dip the mouth of your glass in a bowl of shallow water, lime juice, or lemon juice, and then tip your glass into a small dish with salt in it."

To start, Pour 0.5 ounces of gin, 0.5 ounces of rum, 0.5 ounces of tequila, 0.5 ounces of vodka, 0.5 ounces of Cointreau, 0.75 ounces of lemon juice, and two teaspoons of simple syrup into a Collins glass with ice. Fill the rest of the glass with cola, and garnish your drink with a slice of lemon. Long Island Iced Teas are relatively strong in terms of alcoholic content as far as cocktails go. Keep this in mind while you're drinking it and don't have more than a single Long Island Iced Tea."

Combine 2 ounces of brandy, 1 ounce of Cointreau, and 0.75 ounces of fresh lemon juice in a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Shake it for about ten seconds, then strain in to a prepared glass. Garnish the glass with an orange twist or lemon peel. You can run a lemon wedge or orange wedge around the rim of the glass and dip the rim in to a thin dish of sugar if you\u2019d like to sweeten the drink."

Because Cointreau is 40% alcohol, you can easily enjoy it the same way that you might drink a whiskey on the rocks. Simply pour one ounce of Cointreau over ice and serve it in a cognac snifter or Old Fashioned glass. Cointreau Noir, a form of Cointreau mixed with cognac, is commonly served in this way."

Cointreau has an incredibly sweet flavor profile, and many drinkers enjoy the dynamic flavor on its own. Simply pour one ounce of Cointreau in to a cognac snifter or Old Fashioned glass and enjoy. Cointreau poured neat should be sipped. It is not intended to be drank quickly, and the strong flavors can be quite stiff if ingested too quickly."

In contrast, a digestif is post-meal drink that is designed to help the body digest a meal. Cointreau can be consumed\u2014either neat or over ice\u2014as both an aperitif and digestif. Contrary to tradition, some digestifs can upset the stomach after a meal. If you are prone to digestive issues after a flavorful meal, it may be best to avoid drinking immediately after eating."

If you have the standard cocktail instruments at your home bar, there\u2019s no reason for you to not play around with Cointreau as an ingredient\u2014especially if you enjoy a citrus profile in your cocktails. Any citrus fruit can complement a Cointreau cocktail as a garnish, but an orange peel is an extremely common choice.

If you enjoy Cointreau and experimenting with your beverages, feel free to play around with it as an additional ingredient in your favorite cocktail. Because Cointreau is a brand of triple sec, any drink that lists triple sec as an ingredient can be modified to include Cointreau. Just remember, Cointreau is stronger than most triple secs. Any drink that uses lemon or lime juice as a key ingredient (like a whiskey sour or Penicillin) can play with the flavors brought out in Cointreau, since it is drier than most triple secs and brings out the complex citrus notes. Because of its distinct flavor, Cointreau can cut through the nuances of some spirits. Avoid mixing it with spirits intended to be appreciated on their own (like fine cognacs and scotches)."
