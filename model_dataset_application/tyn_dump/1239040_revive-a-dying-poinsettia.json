Settings with bright, filtered sunlight, like an east or west-facing window or an open living room, will offer the best results.

          "headline":"Water your plant thoroughly every few days.",
          "description":"The exact amount of water you use will depend on the needs of the plant, the size of its container, and the temperature of its surrounding environment. As a general rule, however, you should pour in just enough to moisten the soil. Repeat as frequently as needed, allowing the soil to dry to the touch between waterings. Most average-sized plants will need about \u00be cup (180 mL) of water every 1-2 days. Be careful not to overwater your poinsettia. Soggy soil can lead to root rot and other complications that can easily kill the plant. Make sure that the pot has holes on the bottom for drainage. If it doesn't, get a different pot or drill holes into the bottom."

Be sure to remove any leaves that have already fallen into the plant\u2019s container, as well. Healthy-looking foliage can be left intact. Your poinsettia may look like little more than a bare stick by the time you\u2019re finished pruning. This is completely normal. The colorful foliage will return once the plant emerges from dormancy in the spring."

It\u2019s possible that you may end up clipping all of the existing stems, leaving only the newer offshoots at the base of the plant. Trimming the stems will also help stimulate new growth in plants that are still healthy. Add rotten stems and foliage to your compost pile to convert it into organic material that you can use to treat your poinsettia once it starts growing again. If the stems are diseased or carry pests, however, throw them away in the garbage and not the compost pile."

Balanced water-soluble houseplant fertilizers are the safest choice for delicate plants like poinsettias. Always use the amount specified in the instructions of a particular product. You can also use a natural organic material like garden compost or worm castings to fertilize your poinsettia. The best time to apply fertilizer is soon after watering, while the soil is still moist.
