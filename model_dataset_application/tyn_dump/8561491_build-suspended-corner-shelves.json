Measure from the corner of the wall to the space where you want your bookshelf to hang. Cut two 45 degree angles on a 1x3 inch (2.54x7.62 cm) board. Lay your board on the thin edge. On one end of a 1x3 inch (2.54x7.62 cm) board cut a 45-degree angle with a miter saw. Once you've made one cut, measure 23 inches  (58.42 cm) down the board and mark an X.

This piece of wood will act as the bottom of your shelf. Make straight cuts through the lines you drew on the plywood. Cut each piece of your plywood with a circular saw. Each of these pieces of plywood should be equal in size because you used the same piece of 1x3 inch (2.54x7.62 cm) board as a stencil to draw your cutting line.

Use a hand saw or circular saw to cut a wooden ladder in half, width-wise, so that you have two halves of a ladder with complete rungs. Each half of the ladder will act as a shelf on both walls and will create a corner shelf. Use a stud finder to find the studs in your wall.

Screw in the top L bracket so that the ladder hangs over the L bracket. Screw in the bottom L bracket so that the ladder rests on top of it. Mount your ladder to the L brackets. Lift one-half of your ladder and place it onto your L brackets. Make sure that the brackets line up with the top and bottom of your ladder. After you mount your ladder to the bottom L brackets, you can work on securing the ladder to the brackets themselves. Screw your ladder into the L brackets. Use screws to screw the wooden ladder to the metal L-brackets on the wall. Use a power drill to drive the screws halfway into the holes of the L brackets and into your wooden ladder. Once all the L brackets have been screwed in half way, use your power drill to tighten the screws and secure the ladder to the wall. Repeat the process with the other half of your ladder. Hang and drill the other side of the ladder to the other wall in your room. Once you're done securing it to the wall, you'll have completed creating a corner shelf using a wooden ladder.",

    "Find two studs on each of the walls and draw an X.",
    "When you are done, you should have four Xs.",
    "You'll use the studs to anchor your L brackets.",
    "Measure your walls and cut your ladder to length.",
    "Use a measuring tape to determine the width of each of the walls that you want your ladder bookshelf to be on.",
    "If your walls are smaller than the length of the ladder, you'll have to cut down each half to accommodate the size of your walls.",
    "Use a circular saw to cut down the ladder again to the measurements that you recorded.",
    "Screw L brackets into the wall to support the ladder.",
    "Use screws to screw in the L bracket firmly where you marked the studs.",
    "This bracket will be where the bottom of the ladder rests.",
    "Use a tape measure to gauge the height of your ladder.",
    "Once you get the ladder's height, use a tape measure to draw another X on each of the studs that correspond with the height of the ladder.",
    "This will designate where the top L brackets should be screwed in.",
    "Once you've screwed in all of your L brackets you should have a total of 4 L brackets on each wall.",
    "Screw in the top L bracket so that the ladder hangs over the L bracket.",
    "Screw in the bottom L bracket so that the ladder rests on top of it.",
    "Mount your ladder to the L brackets.",
    "Lift one-half of your ladder and place it onto your L brackets.",
    "Make sure that the brackets line up with the top and bottom of your ladder.",
    "After you mount your ladder to the bottom L brackets, you can work on securing the ladder to the brackets themselves.",
    "Screw your ladder into the L brackets.",
    "Use screws to screw the wooden ladder to the metal L-brackets on the wall.",
    "Use a power drill to drive the screws halfway into the holes of the L brackets and into your wooden ladder.",
    "Once all the L brackets have been screwed in half way, use your power drill to tighten the screws and secure the ladder to the wall.",
    "Repeat the process with the other half of your ladder.",
    "Hang and drill the other side of the ladder to the other wall in your room.",
    "Once you're done securing it to the wall, you'll have completed creating a corner shelf using a wooden ladder."
