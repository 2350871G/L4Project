          "description":"With your blind still mounted in the window, lower the slats as far as they can go. Use a measuring tape to measure the height from the bottom rail to the top of the head rail. Then, double this measurement so that the blind has enough string on both sides to raise and lower it all the way. Next, measure the width of the window and add that to your measurement so that you have enough excess string stored in the head rail to lower your blinds.Tip: It is extremely difficult to replace ladder strings\u2014the horizontal lengths of string that keep the individual slats in place. If your blind\u2019s ladder strings are broken, you\u2019re better off simply replacing the blind. While it can be difficult to do, see if you can measure the width of the string itself. If you get a string that is too big for your blind, the string won\u2019t fit through the openings."

Don\u2019t worry if the string is longer than the number you measured since you can always cut it, but you cannot restring your blinds with a cord shorter than the number you measured. Blind cord kits come with a restring tool, which is a small length of soft metal with an oval-shaped opening on the end.

Most cord kits come with tassels and washers so that you can replace the plastic parts on the string. They don\u2019t typically include a replacement wand or new brackets, though. If your wand and brackets work, feel free to keep them. Otherwise, you can buy replacements from the manufacturer or your local home supply store.

    "Then, pull the washer up to the location where the lift cord meets the head rail when the blind is fully lowered.",
    "Thread the remaining cord through the opposite side of the washer and pull it all the way through before tying a knot just below the washer.",
    "Repeat this process on the opposite side.Variation: On some washers, you need to pinch the lift cord together and bring 2 lengths of string through the washer before running the length of string at the bottom through the loop created by the 2 lengths.",
    "You may need to use the wire restring tool to push the string through the narrow opening in the washer.",
    "Cut your lift cords at the point where you want the string to hang.",
    "Lower the blinds to the point where the bottom rail is at the bottom of the window sill.",
    "Then, hold your hand out to determine where you are most comfortable gripping the lift cords.",
    "Cut both strings just below the location where you want them to hang.",
    "You typically want to grab the lift cords a little lower than eye level.",
    "Reattach your tassels so that you have something to grab.",
    "Slide the bottom of your first lift cord through the top of your first tassel.",
    "Slide it up 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm) before tying a knot at the bottom of the cord.",
    "Let the tassel slide down to the bottom so that it catches on the knot.",
    "Repeat this process on the other side to finish restringing your blinds."
