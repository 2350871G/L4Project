          "description":"There are a few basic options when it comes to buying potatoes: baking, boiling, and all-purpose potatoes. All have different qualities when it comes to flavor and texture. Baking potatoes, such as Russets, are high in starch which creates light and fluffy mashed potatoes. Boiling potatoes, such as red potatoes, are considered waxy which means they hold their shape and may create lumpy mashed potatoes. All-purpose potatoes, such as Yukon Golds, fall in between boiling and baking potatoes in terms of texture. They do offer a butterier flavor than Russets."

If you wash the potatoes in a bowl of water, be sure to rinse them before cutting. You can use a small brush specifically designated for cleaning potatoes or produce. This will help scrub away any dirt that's firmly stuck."

Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a lively simmer and cook for 10 to 20 minutes. The potatoes are done when you stick a fork into them and they start to fall apart. You can salt your water for extra flavor, just as though you're cooking pasta. The potatoes will absorb the salt as they cook. Avoid using hot water and covering your pot with a lid. This will make the potatoes cook unevenly and can lead to gluey potatoes."

Use chicken stock if you'd like the potato flavor to really shine. Milk, ranging from skim to whole, will make creamier potatoes. Heating your liquid will keep the mashed potatoes hotter for longer. Warm liquid is also absorbed better by the potatoes."

Add your room temperature butter and start mashing the potatoes. The best tool for mashing rustic potatoes is a simple potato masher. Avoid mashing too much or you'll be left with more of a puree.

Keep adding liquid gradually until the potatoes bind together. Avoid adding all your liquid at once. You could end up with too much liquid which makes mushy mashed potatoes. Your potatoes will need more or less liquid depending on potato type and level of starchiness."
