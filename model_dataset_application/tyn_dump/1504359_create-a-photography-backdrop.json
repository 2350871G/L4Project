Put out a plastic sheet, and use painter's tape to secure it to the floor so it doesn't move around. This sheeting needs to be big enough to go under your backdrop plus some, so pick one up from the hardware store. This will work best on a hard surface. If you only have a carpeted space, try putting a large piece of cardboard down."

          "headline":"Put your piece of canvas material on top of the sheet.",
          "description":"Unfold the material and pull it over the plastic. Make sure to leave space around each edge on the plastic so you have room to go past the canvas a little when you're painting. You'll need at least 1 foot (0.30 m) on each side. Secure it to the plastic on the back with pieces of painter's tape rolled up on themselves to make double-sided tape. You can purchase canvas from craft stores, but you can also buy a linen canvas dropcloth from the hardware store. The size is up to you, but 9 by 12 feet (2.7 by 3.7 m) is a good size. It should allow you to shoot full-body shots with small groups of people."

          "description":"Roll the primer onto the canvas, going one direction across it. Let it dry for 30 minutes, then go the other way across the fabric, perpendicularly to the direction you went the first time. Do the same for a third coat, going the same direction you went the first time. Make sure to let it dry completely before moving on to the next step. You can also use 1 part PVA sealer mixed with 5 parts water. You may only need 2 coats with PVA. You may want to wear gloves for this process!"

Use a can of indoor acrylic paint for the best results. Apply the paint in an even coat across the canvas using a paint roller, painting in a v-shape as you move up and down the canvas. An extended roller will make this process easier. Make sure this is your darkest color because it will allow the other colors to pop out in front. Apply more than 1 layer to get an even coat. Wait for this layer to dry completely before moving on to the next coat. You may need to leave it for 24 hours. Wait 24 hour after you apply the second coat, too."

          "headline":"Add your next colors, limiting it to 2-4 colors.",
          "description":"You can add other colors in several ways. You can water one color down by 50% or so so it doesn't apply an even coat, giving it a fun splotchy effect. You can sponge it on, or you can even splatter it on. If you want the colors blended, use a clean string mop to rub the colors together using a circular motion. Make sure to blend the colors while they are still wet. You can also splatter colors on after you've blended your other colors well. Pick colors that add depth to the painting but that don't stand out too much. For instance, if you start with a midnight blue as a background, you may want to add a dark grey and a muted olive green."

          "description":"Let it dry for at least 24 hours, but 2 days is even better. With so many layers of paint, you want to be sure everything is solid before you try to move it. When you do roll it up, place an extra sheet of plastic on top of the canvas, and then roll it up with the layer of plastic underneath. Stick it in a cardboard tube made for backdrops to store it. You can buy these tubes online or at photography stores. Store it in a cool, dark location."
