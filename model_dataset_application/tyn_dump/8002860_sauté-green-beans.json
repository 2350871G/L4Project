Set the saucepan on your stove over medium-high to high heat, and let it reach a rolling boil. Do not add the green beans before the water reaches a boil since doing so would cause the green beans to overcook. If desired, you can add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt to the boiling water. Doing so may help enhance the flavor of the green beans, but it will also add more sodium to the dish, so you can opt to leave it out if desired."

This prevents the green beans from continuing to cook after being removed from boiling water. This process, known as blanching, is a recommended cooking practice for vegetables that removes bacteria, and stops enzyme actions that result in loss of vitamins, flavor, color and texture. You may opt to skip blanching if you\u2019re in a hurry, but blanching is strongly recommended. Skipping the blanching process may result in a loss of some nutritional value and taste."

Note that blanched green beans can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to two days, but when possible, you should move directly into the sauteeing process from the blanching process to ensure the best flavor and texture."

If using you\u2019re using a nonstick skillet, you must add oil to the pan before preheating to extend the life of the nonstick coating. If using another type of skillet, you may either preheat the pan first for about five minutes and add the oil after, or preheat the oil and the pan simultaneously as done with a nonstick skillet; the choice is less crucial here, so do whichever cooking practice feels more comfortable."

Be careful when working with garlic. It burns quickly if left unattended, which will ruin the taste of the dish.

When experimenting with flavor, start small--about 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of any spice or 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of any dried herb--toss to coat, taste test, and add more as desired. Popular herbs for green beans include basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, sage, and tarragon. If you\u2019d like to stick with only one herb, try rosemary; if you\u2019d prefer an herb blend, basil, oregano, and thyme often work well together. For a spicier dish, consider cumin, chili powder, or curry. For something deep yet mild, consider celery seed or nutmeg. You should also keep the other dishes of your meal in mind when choosing spices, and pair the seasonings added to your green beans accordingly. For instance, if you\u2019re serving the green beans with chicken flavored with rosemary, adding a little rosemary to the green beans can help tie the meal together."

Add the green beans and continue cooking as usual. If you don't like the taste of toasted nuts but still want to try this option, you can also add the nuts to the dish alongside the salt and pepper.

Add the dressing to the green beans after sauteeing them, tossing to coat well. You can either allow it to warm up in the pan for another minute or let the dressing remain at room temperature by serving the green beans immediately after.

Cook the green beans as usual, then sprinkle the finished green beans with the bacon before serving. You can saute the green beans in the bacon grease for a stronger bacon flavor, or drain the bacon grease and stick with olive oil for a healthier variation."
