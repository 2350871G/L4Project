To open it, hold the bowtie on both sides right next to the folded center of the bowtie, then gently pull. The folds should expand, then open to reveal the face of George Washington right on the center of the bowtie! Push on the center if it is not flattening. Making a Skinny Dollar Bill Bow Tie Fold and unfold a dollar bill. A skinny dollar bill bow tie gives you a more old fashioned looking bow tie that is long and thin and has a small, square center. To begin making this design, take a dollar bill and place it on a flat surface with the front of the bill facing up. Fold it horizontally in half \u201chotdog\u201d style, then unfold. Then fold it top to bottom \u201chamburger style\u201d and unfold. Fold the four corners towards the centerline. Take all four corners of the bill and fold them over in small triangles whose inside edges almost touch the central fold. Fold each long edge towards the center crease. Take the top long edge of the dollar bill and fold it over towards the central crease of the dollar bill so that the edge almost touches the crease. Repeat on bottom edge, folding it up so that the edge nearly touches the central crease. Make a vertical crease. You should now have a long, skinny folded over bill with a crease running horizontally through it and triangular points at each end. Fold the bill in half so that the points touch, then unfold the fold you just made to make a vertical crease. Fold and unfold the bill to make \u201cx\u201d shaped creases. The dollar bill should now be folded in a long, skinny shape that lays horizontally. Create a backward lowercase \u201cr\u201d by folding the right side of the bill down, making a diagonal crease at the center point of the bill. Unfold this fold and repeat on the left hand side, this time making a lowercase \u201cr\u201d shape by folding the left side of the bill down at the central point to make a lowercase \u201cr\u201d shape, then unfolding. Do a squash fold to make a diamond shape. After making the two x-shaped folds, turn the bill over to the unfolded side. You will see the \u201cx\u201d shaped creases in the center. Use your fingers to \u201csquish\u201d the top and the bottom triangles of the x in on themselves, which folds the bill in half into a diamond shape. Fold the ends of the diamond shape over the central crease. Hold the diamond shape by the end that is not connected to the crease and fold it over the other side so that it is hanging further than the crease. Turn the bill over and repeat on the other side. Fold the bill so both ends meet. You should now have a folded bill that looks like a \u201cz\u201d shape when viewed from the side, with one end sticking to the left, the central folded area in the middle as the base, and the other end sticking over to the left. Take the one end of the bill and fold it 90 degrees under so that the ends are now parallel to each other, with their folded sides facing outward. Each end of the dollar bill should roughly be in a pentagon shape. Fold the corners of the pentagon shape toward the center line. Take the bottom edges of the pentagon shape and fold the corners in towards the center fold in triangle shapes. Turn the folded bill over and repeat on the other side. Pull ends to open up the bowtie. Take both pointed ends in each hand, with one finger against the back of the pointed fold in the center. Gently pull each end out while using your finger to gently push the central crease in towards you. Pull to flatten the center square. Your bow tie is almost complete, with the central square of the bow tie still looking a little folded. Hold the bow tie on both sides right next to this central square and pull. The square will expand, then flatten to create a perfect, skinny bowtie! Attaching Your Dollar Bill Bow Tie Clip the bow tie with a paperclip. The easiest way to attach the dollar bill bow tie to your shirt is to clip it on with a paperclip. Flip the bow tie over to the back side and hook one end of the paperclip into a fold of the bow tie. Then hook the bowtie into the collar of your shirt to keep it in place! Pin the bow tie to your shirt. Another more secure way to attach the bow tie is to use a safety pin. Turn the bow tie to the back side and weave the safety pin through a small section of the bow tie. Then pin the safety pin into the spot of your shirt where you want to affix the tie. Glue a clip to the dollar bill bow tie. Another way to attach the dollar bill bow to is to use a clip to hold it in place. Purchase a small clip and glue it to the back of the tie using hot glue or another strong glue. Then clip the tie in place. Keep in mind that if you use hot glue, you may render the bill unusable if you accidentally tear it when you detach it from the clip.",
