You can even cut the bubbles and smooth them down. Most people like to apply their design to the border of a glass or mirror, so that you can still use the mirror. If you have a very large mirror, you can use larger designs near the bottom or top and still have use of the mirror. Contact paper will work for any kind of design, from ornate to simple. This is because it creates a good seal between the glass and the etching compound."
