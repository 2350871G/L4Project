  "text":" Fabric Hammock for Frame Cut the fabric. Measure the fabric to 225cm/88.5 inches long and 128cm/50.3 inches wide, then cut. Turn under the seam allowance at both the top and bottom of the fabric length. Make this 1.25cm/0.49 inches and do it twice. Sew in place. Along the long side, turn in 6.25cm/2.4 inches each side, twice. Sew in place. This forms the casing for the ropes. Measure the tab-top tape across each short end and cut. Pin in place at each end, then turn under and stitch to the first fabric piece. Use strong stitching and do two rows for added strength. Do not sew across the rope casings on each long side. Cut the piece of dowel into two even halves. Drill an 8mm/0.31 of an inch hole at each end of the dowel, 3cm/1.1 inches in from the ends. Push the first half of the dowel through the base tabs of the hammock. Then thread the other dowel through the top end. Prepare the ski rope. Cut the rope to 9 meters/354 inches. Singe the ends to stop fraying (use a lighter, hot plate or candle flame). Place the hammock on a flat surface such as a clear long table or the floor.

Hang the hammock on the hammock frame by looping it around the frame holes. Naval Hammock Cut a canvas to measure 2 meters/6 1/2 feet by 1.2 meters/4 feet. Lengthen the measurements if tall people will be using the hammock. Bear in mind that 15cm/6 inches will be lost from making the hammock. Turn in the long edges of the canvas 3.8cm/ 1.5 inches. Sew a seam. Turn the short ends of the canvas in 3.8cm/1.5 inches. Press into place. Repeat one more time and press in place. Then sew the pressed ends together, using at least two or three rows of stitching. Keep the stitches at least 2.5cm/1 inch from the end, to leave space for the grommets. Mark 20 evenly spaced spots along each end of the hammock. These mark the grommet placement. Use an invisible fabric marker or tailor's chalk. Punch the grommets into place along the marks.

Mount the folded cords to the ring with a larks head knot. Slip the ring over an upturned milkshake cup or secure to the work surface in some other way. Spread the cords out and straighten them.

Cut the tarp or blanket to size. This is optional, only if needed. Allow for sag in the middle, below your feet and above your head before choosing to cut. If you want to be able to use the item again for its original purpose, avoid cutting it. Pull one end of the tarp or blanket together in a bunch.
