It's important that you use a pipe spring smaller in diameter than the tube you're trying to bend. Otherwise, it won't fit inside.

Make sure you leave at least a couple inches of spring sticking out, as this will allow you to remove it once you've finished shaping the tube. Use a deburring tool to remove any metallic burrs on the end of the tube that might present an obstruction to the spring. Tubes that have been cut by a tube cutter often have slightly rounded ends which may not accommodate a pipe spring of the same size as the tubing. In this case, you'll need to recut the tubing rather than using a smaller pipe spring."

It may help to shape the tube around a fixed fulcrum, such as the point of your knee. Continue bending the tube until it reaches a suitable form. Tube springs work by providing internal support for the tube, which makes it less likely to kink, warp, or collapse while being bent. Bending the tube gradually cuts down even further on the chances of small ripples and creases forming in the soft metal."

This will wind the coiled shaft tighter, momentarily reducing its width enough for you to yank it free."
